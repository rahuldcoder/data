-- i think it 's fair to say that most of us have been absolutely horrified by the plight of tens of thousands of @entity5 this month			1
a massive earthquake is always devastating , but for such carnage and misery to be wrought upon a people who already had nothing seems especially cruel			0
it was 0100 gmt when i went on air , the aftershocks were both frequent and significant , and from the tweets i read there was a sense of utter panic and fear on the streets			0
the pictures have been absolutely heartbreaking , and the stories our crews have reported from all over the country have been terribly moving			0
i wanted to do something to help			0
for some reason i was especially moved when @entity27 dragged that bleeding boy out of the street - a young boy who was stunned and panicked and terribly vulnerable - and i realized that i had something i could contribute			0
click here to place a bid on the @entity35 flag ( @entity37 number : 250569560734 ) years ago , when i was the @entity38 anchor , i was looking to collect something unusual for a charity auction			1
as it happens , the auction was cancelled and since then i had largely forgotten that i had something of value and unique at the back of my wardrobe			0
the @entity35 , one of golf 's most illustrious competitions , is never more special than when held at @entity49 , the so - called " home of golf			1
" every professional wants to be " @entity52 " and of the last seven tournaments to be played up there , many of the champions have been legends of the sport			0
@entity59 won it twice , as did @entity61			1
@entity62 and @entity63 complete the roll - call of champions who have already made it into the pantheon of greats			1
it struck me that to get all four to autograph a replica flag from the @entity72 would be pretty special			1
@entity62 ( 1984 winner ) obliged me in @entity74 later that year , with a signature as flamboyant as many of his shots			2
@entity61 ( 2000 and 2005 winner ) added his name when we met in @entity81 the next year			1
@entity63 ( 1990 winner ) and i live in the same town but our paths never seemed to cross when they needed to and so i posted the flag to his management company and from somewhere on his global travels he obliged			1
my colleague @entity90 interviewed @entity59 ( 1970 and 1978 winner ) at the @entity92 and , though @entity59 had n't bargained on signing any autographs that day , @entity89 's producer @entity88 bagged the all important tag			1
so , just to recap , some of the greatest names in golf have signed this unique memento			2
also up for auction are the xeroxed scorecards of all four players when they last all played the @entity103 in 2000			0
you 'll see @entity61 's winning round , counter-signed by another open champion @entity107 and another card is counter-signed by a man who was n't yet a major winner , @entity109			1
you 'll note the meticulous nature of @entity63 's game , every hole is neatly ticked off and appropriately , there 's even a squiggle and a correction on the card of @entity120 @entity119 , the only @entity35 champion at @entity49 since 1970 that i was unable to persuade to sign the flag			1
but maybe his autograph absence and messy scorecard are in keeping with the erratic character we have come to know and love ! this year just so happens to be the 150th anniversary of @entity35 at @entity49 and so it 's appropriate to auction the flag and the cards in 2010			2
but @entity5 is the true motivation for the sale			2
it is right because they desperately need help			0
all proceeds of the sale will go to a charity called @entity139 , who have been working in @entity5 for over thirty years			2
the donation will support their emergency relief and recovery work there with children and their communities ; helping the most vulnerable and the very people who are the country 's future			0
i hope you will bid on the flag , and if not please help spread the word of the sale so that we can get a really good price for it			0
it deserves a good home , and the auction will help ensure a brighter future for many children in their darkest hour .			0
