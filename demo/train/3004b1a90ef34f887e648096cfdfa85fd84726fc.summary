@entity0 -- federal officials and the nation 's 15,000 air traffic controllers announced wednesday they are extending an existing work contract for another four years			1
controllers will get the same pay raise given to other federal government employees instead of independently negotiating raises , the @entity7 and the @entity8 said			1
the announcement , coming six months before the expiration of the existing contract , suggests improved relations between management and labor			0
it appears both sides wanted to avoid the bruising battles that characterized some previous negotiations			0
under the contract extension , work rules will remain the same , the @entity7 said			0
and the controllers will get the same raises the president and @entity27 authorize for other federal employees			1
the current contract was enacted in 2009 and was to expire on october 1			0
but the extension , which did not require a vote of the union 's members , will prolong the agreement until july 1 , 2016			2
in a joint statement , acting faa administrator @entity35 and @entity8 president @entity36 said the extension serves both organizations			2
" this contract extension will provide stability for our work force ; ensure continued collaboration to transform the air traffic system through @entity46 , delivering more on - time and fuel - efficient flights ; and continue to provide the safest air transportation system in the world			1
" @entity46 is the satellite - based navigation system that currently is being phased in to replace the existing ground - based radar system			0
contract negotiations between the @entity7 and its controllers historically have been fractious			2
in 1981 , president @entity54 fired striking controllers , leading to the decertification of the @entity57 , or @entity57			0
and , after contract talks broke down in 2005 , the union worked for more than three years under a contract imposed by president @entity61 and @entity27 .			1

the agreement avoids the fractious negotiation process of previous contract talks
air traffic controllers will get the same pay raises *approved* for other federal employees
the @entity8 has 15,000 members
