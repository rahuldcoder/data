@entity0 , @entity1 -- call him @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 -- whatever you want			1
it 's all okay with him			2
beaming a warm smile from beneath his push - broom mustache , the softly spoken 74 - year - old does n't strike you as a pioneering innovator -- the man responsible for a breakthrough that 's now driving forward the world of manufacturing			2
but @entity20 -- " in this kind of environment , it 's usually ' @entity6 ' , " he says , as he sits down with @entity2 in @entity0 , @entity1 -- is executive vice president and chief technology officer of @entity25 , a company built on his creation : the 3d printer			1
in 1983 , @entity29 was working for a small business that made tough coatings for tables using ultraviolet lamps			1
when he suggested a new way to use the uv technology -- to quickly turn computer designs into working prototypes -- @entity29 was given a little lab to play around in during his evenings and weekends			1
@entity29 experimented for months , on his own with a plastic - y gloop -- then one night , something emerged ... @entity2 : when you began , what materials exactly were you using ? @entity29 : the class of materials is called " photopolymers " and these are typically acrylic - based materials that would be liquid until they 're hit with -- let 's say -- an ultraviolet light			1
then , they instantly turn solid			2
so , you have a vat of this liquid and a point of ultraviolet light , and you turn it into a solid piece of plastic			2
and that 's the basic method ? that 's the basic methodology -- that 's stereolithography			2
who was the first person you showed it to ? @entity67 , my wife			2
i got a good part and called her up , got her out of her pajamas , told her to come down to the lab and see this			2
what did she say ? " this had better be good ! " ( @entity75			0
) explore : the @entity77 revolution and then , when did you see 3d printing take off ? well , it 's really blossomed just in the last few years -- in the sense of really rapid growth and recognition			1
there 's a lots of things that contributed to that , i think : a lot of the medical applications catch peoples ' imagination ; certainly the maker movement , with low - cost machines getting hobbyists interested in inventing and building using 3d printing			1
how did the process develop into what it is today ? one of the most significant [ changes ] is the basic accuracy you can achieve : because [ the materials ] cure from a liquid to a solid , they tend to shrink and they can distort			1
so as you build these 3d parts you get some inaccuracies and warp - age			1
but that chemistry has been vastly improved , so there 's almost no distortion now			0
also the physical properties : initially the materials were really brittle -- they would break easily			0
nowadays you get really good , tough plastic materials			0
i hear the word " democratization " used about @entity77			1
is that important to you ? the whole premise of this technology has been to foster creativity , and change in product design and manufacturing , and so forth			0
at the individual level , i think there 's a great kind of pent up need : we 've got into the computer age and everything is on a screen or remote , we 've kind of missed the tangible result			0
this is a means to convert something on the computer to reality in a straightforward way			0
could you have imagined all this ? ( @entity75			0
) not at the consumer level			0
i was always thinking in terms of design engineers -- in terms of their expensive @entity148 computers and so forth			0
what do you think the industry is worth now ? i think , well , in terms of the total goods and services , it 's about $ 3 billion annually and it 's actually growing at a rapid rate			0
are there limits to what 3d printing can do ? there 's limits to everything			1
so , the kind of traditional limits of 3d printing have been : material properties , speed , making millions of things			1
but all the competitive companies are just constantly pushing those limits , so if you 're projecting the future , it looks like these limits are going to be beat down over the next couple of years			1
what has surprised you most ? to me , some of the medical applications			0
i did n't anticipate that , and as soon as i started working with some of the medical imaging people , it became pretty clear that this was going to work			0
but , you know , they told me , i did n't tell them			0
what does your wife say ? ( @entity75 ) she 's probably more enthusiastic than i am , so she 's very excited about this whole field			0
you made your discovery 30 years ago : how have you felt along these long 30 years ? i mean , it 's exploded has n't it ? well , you know i 'm old enough that i should have retired long ago , but it 's so interesting that i do n't			1
it 's a really interesting journey			0
watch the video above for more from @entity20 about his incredible invention and @entity77 today .			1

@entity20 is the @entity198 engineer who invented 3d printing
@entity29 created the first @entity77 in 1983 and has been refining his creation ever since
he says the process has " blossomed " in the last few years
