@entity0 -- a control unit on the @entity6 's blowout preventer was leaking hydraulic fluid before the explosion that unleashed the worst oil spill in @entity11 history , a @entity3 official testified tuesday			1
@entity12 , one of @entity3 's well site leaders -- " company men , " in rig jargon -- told the @entity18 - @entity17 board investigating the drill platform 's sinking that there were " off and on " problems with valves that directed hydraulic fluid inside the mechanism			1
he said he reported the problem to his superiors , but the rig continued to operate despite the problem			2
federal regulations require that drilling work halt if a control " pod " is inoperable			1
@entity12 said the unit was still functional , but his team leader should have reported the issue to the @entity36 , the recently reorganized @entity17 agency that regulated offshore drilling			1
" i guess we assumed that everything was ok , since i reported it to the team leader and he should have reported it to the @entity36 , " @entity12 said			2
his team leader , @entity3 executive @entity43 , is scheduled to testify before the investigative board thursday			2
@entity6 's blowout preventer failed to shut down the runaway well at the heart of the @entity49 oil spill after the april 20 explosion aboard the rig			1
the resulting fire sank the platform , leaving 11 workers dead and releasing an undersea gusher that engineers were unable to contain until last week			0
@entity12 and @entity57 were the two " company men " who worked aboard the rig , but @entity12 was ashore at the time of the blast for additional training on blowout preventers			1
he was replaced on the rig by @entity66 , who invoked his @entity67 right against self - incrimination tuesday when called to testify			1
@entity57 has been excused from testifying for medical reasons , the company said monday night			2
the board released a list of more than 20 reported anomalies with the well in the 18 hours before the explosion , ranging from low pressure readings and larger - than - expected returns of " mud , " the drilling fluid used as a counterweight and lubricant aboard the rig			1
both @entity57 and @entity66 were involved in discussions about the anomalous pressure readings in the hours before the explosion , the according to the list			0
@entity3 , rig owner @entity85 and well cementing contractor @entity87 all blamed each other for the disaster			1
previous hearings have included testimony about maintenance backlogs aboard the rig and disputes between @entity3 and @entity85 managers about procedures as they prepared to shut in the well , which was already behind schedule			1
@entity99 , a subsea supervisor for @entity3 contractor @entity100 , testified tuesday he questioned why @entity3 was waiting to install a " lockdown sleeve " -- a fitting placed atop the well to secure the casing -- after drilling fluid was replaced with seawater for pressure tests			1
" i asked why could n't we go ahead and do this in mud , " he said			2
in response , @entity99 said he was told " it was n't going to happen			2
we were going to go through the sequence we were given			0
" @entity99 said he 's " selective " about questioning his orders			2
but he added , " if i would have seen something and recognized it as being unsafe or a threat , i would have taken it all the way into town			0
" this week 's hearings come as scientists continue testing pressure in @entity3 's ruptured deepwater well and weighing options for permanently sealing it			1
even as lawyers and witnesses resist some questions before the panel , the hearings are providing dramatic details of what happened on the rig , and could form the basis for criminal charges down the line			0
a sworn statement from @entity6 chief engineer @entity138 sparked particularly heated debate monday			0
in it , @entity138 described the rig 's captain screaming at a crew member who issued a distress call and ordering an injured man left behind			1
lawyers repeatedly attempted to ask @entity138 about the document , which has not been publicly released			0
but his lawyer , @entity148 , said the statement was made while his client was " detained " aboard a rescue ship and told @entity138 not to answer questions about it			0
" this statement was obtained from him while he was held 26 hours right immediately after this incident , which was extremely traumatic to say the least , " @entity148 said			0
" it is what it is			0
we 're not going to be cross-examined on something that occurred , that was written down at that time			0
" an attorney for rig captain @entity161 criticized lawyers for introducing the statement			0
it was " an attempt to assassinate his character in one aspect of what 's being done where all their lives were at risk , " attorney @entity164 said			0
but @entity3 lawyer @entity174 seized on the statement , saying it showed " a complete loss of command and control aboard the bridge " after the explosions			2
@entity138 also testified monday that the rig 's bridge crew was unsure who had the authority to activate the rig 's emergency disconnection from the well			1
when it was activated , it failed to work despite indications on the control panel that it had been activated , he said			0
