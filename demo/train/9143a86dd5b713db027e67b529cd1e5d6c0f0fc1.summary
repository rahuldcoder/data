they call it an airbridge , but it feels more like a flight to another planet			0
the " easiest " way to get to the @entity7 is on a @entity9 charter flight from @entity10 in central @entity11			1
but it 's not that easy			2
from the time i shut my front door in @entity16 to the time we touch down on these remote islands , 24 hours have elapsed			1
an eight - hour leg to the @entity20 -- a tiny speck of land in the @entity23 -- and then another eight hours down to @entity24 on the @entity7 -- a slightly bigger speck of land			1
but this speck is suddenly back in focus as @entity16 and @entity29 spar again over its sovereignty			1
the two countries went to war over the issue in 1982 , and tensions between the two countries are rising again over the islands which @entity29 calls @entity7			1
how royal visit fuels @entity7 spat my first impression on landing is how similar the base is to the one we 'd left in @entity43			1
here though , posters on the walls advertize the penguin colonies			0
for nature enthusiasts this is a paradise with vast swathes of untouched wildness			0
see high - res images of life in the @entity7 outside the wire , a rough gravel road and barren countryside give the impression of being in the @entity57 of @entity58			1
no trees , lots of sheep and every other car is a @entity63			0
and lots and lots of ... well , nothing			0
no houses , no people , no electricity pylons , nothing			0
finally we approach the capital @entity73 , or just plain @entity73 as the locals call it			2
it 's more like a village really -- a couple of food stores , a post office , some pubs and a gift shop			1
and everything is quintessentially @entity16			2
red telephone boxes , warm beer , fish and chips			1
it reminds me of @entity89 or @entity58 : windy , isolated and bathed in a similar dazzling light			0
our first stop is @entity93 , where we see @entity94 waddling across powder white sand			0
@entity101 , apart from the signs warning you to watch your step , because this used to be an @entity29 minefield			2
the mines should have been cleared , but you never know , seems to be the message			0
it does n't exactly encourage parents to take their kids down to the water to watch the wildlife			0
the islanders are proud , tanned , rugged and permanently wrapped up against the chill of the south @entity23			0
they say they are @entity7 first , @entity16 second , and most wo n't countenance the idea of becoming @entity29			1
they are no nonsense to the point of being , at times , slightly stubborn			0
but they are also immensely hospitable			0
everyone seems to know everyone else -- many are related , distant cousins or connected by marriage			2
hardly surprising in a community of just 3,000 people			0
they seem slightly amused and perplexed by some of the rhetoric coming out of @entity129 , but they are analyzing every word			1
many are withering about @entity133 , the outspoken @entity29 president			1
they say their feelings have been utterly ignored in the war of words between @entity16 and @entity29			1
most are fervently loyal to @entity16 but in fact these islands are not part of the @entity16			1
there are one of 14 @entity142 like @entity143 or @entity144 , a sort of halfway house between independence and colony			0
the @entity7 government can raise its own taxes and has its own bank notes , but it relies on the @entity16 for defense and foreign policy -- and a supply of home comforts , like @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			1
a couple of days into our trip , we get news of excitement at the only school on the island			0
an @entity9 search and rescue helicopter has landed on the football pitch			0
everyone 's taking pictures , hoping prince @entity170 , the @entity171 is piloting the chopper			2
it 's difficult to tell , but the town is abuzz afterwards			2
his presence here might be " routine " as the @entity16 government says and " provocative " for the @entity29 , but for the islanders it 's special			1
he has n't been spotted drinking in the local pubs yet , but on such a small island with so little to do , it 's surely only a matter of time			2
we wo n't be here to share that first pint though -- the airbridge beckons for the long , long journey home .			2

the @entity7 , or @entity7 , are the source of a long - running *dispute* between the @entity16 and @entity29
most residents on the @entity16 *protectorate* are loyal to the @entity16 despite their *proximity* to @entity29
life in the capital is *reminiscent* of an @entity11 village -- red telephone boxes , warm beer , and fish and chips -- with penguins
as international tensions simmer , locals are analyzing every word coming from @entity29 's president
