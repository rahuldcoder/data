-- i was born in @entity2 , @entity3 , in 1954 , the year of the landmark school desegregation case , @entity4			1
the struggle for integration has shaped my life from the very beginning			0
when my father , an art professor at @entity11 , sought to pursue his doctorate in art education at @entity14 , the state of @entity3 chose to pay his transportation to @entity16 rather than open its doors to an @entity19 graduate student			0
in 1957 , he completed his degree at @entity16 , and in 1958 became the first @entity19 - @entity19 professor at @entity22 , now @entity22 , in @entity23 , where i grew up			0
my parents were part of the great migration , moving to the @entity27 to escape segregation			1
my three siblings and i attended predominantly white public schools in our small @entity23 town without protest or high court drama , and graduated well - prepared for the colleges we all attended			1
forty - four years later , in 2002 , my husband and i left @entity23 and returned to the @entity39 -- initiating our family 's reverse migration			0
eventually our sons , and even my parents , moved to @entity44 , too			0
they returned to a region very different than the one they remembered			0
fifty years after the passage of the @entity53 , their choice of housing and their freedom of movement are unencumbered by race			0
but 60 years after racial segregation was outlawed in schools , public education is again segregating along racial lines			1
and not just in the @entity39 , but across the @entity59			0
schools are more segregated today than in the 1980s , according to a new report released by researchers at @entity64 's @entity63 , " @entity4 at 60 : @entity65 , a @entity66 and @entity67			1
" this is the result of continued patterns of residential segregation , and a series of @entity73 decisions that have quietly undermined the implementation of @entity4 through a shift away from court - ordered busing and other mandated desegregation strategies			1
as school districts move back to " neighborhood school " policies , white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had			1
particularly for young white children , interaction with people of color is likely to be a virtual reality rather than an actual one , with media images ( often negative ones ) most clearly shaping their attitudes and perceived knowledge of communities of color			0
for students of color , the return to segregation means the increased likelihood of attending a school with limited resources			1
most highly segregated black and @entity104 schools have high percentages of poor children			1
at most highly segregated white schools , middle - class students are in the majority			1
the negative educational impact of attending high - poverty schools is well - documented			2
whether a student comes from a poor or middle - income family , academic achievement is likely to decline if the student attends a high - poverty school			2
conversely , academic performance is likely to improve if the student attends a middle - class school , even if his or her own family is poor			2
the learning conditions which are taken for granted in middle - class suburban schools are too often absent in impoverished classrooms			2
it is not surprising that the outcomes associated with high - poverty schools across the country are bleak : lower test scores , higher dropout rates , fewer course offerings and low levels of college attendance			2
if we remember that the original impetus for the @entity4 lawsuit was not simply a symbolic fight for the acknowledgment of the equality of all children , but a struggle for equal access to publicly funded educational resources , we can see that the struggle continues			1
so , what must we do ? in particular , white children will need to be in schools that are intentional about helping them understand social justice issues like prejudice , discrimination and racism , empowering them to think critically about the stereotypes to which they are exposed in the culture			2
such tools are needed to help them acquire the social skills necessary to function effectively in a diverse world , and are essential for continued progress in a society still struggling to disentangle the racism woven into the fabric of its founding			0
the hopeful news is that there are educators around the country working hard to create anti-racist classrooms and learning environments even when their classrooms are predominantly white			0
children of color in under - resourced , racially isolated schools also need these same tools			0
but they will also require powerful advocates to insure that they have committed and well - trained teachers , a challenging curriculum and the educational resources needed to inspire their own striving for excellence			0
providing these resources equitably is a daunting task , one that has never been accomplished in the history of education in the @entity59			0
yet we fail to do it at our own peril			1
in 2014 , the question we all must ask is : how do we build strong school communities where every student , regardless of race , is supported to achieve his or her personal best , and teach the skills needed to live in healthy , democratic society ? when we can answer that question , the promise of @entity4 will be fulfilled .			1

the 60th *anniversary* of @entity4 is may *17* , 2014
the @entity73 case desegregated public schools
public schools are again segregating along racial lines
