-- the @entity2 administration will allow minors to obtain one form of the emergency contraception known as the " morning - after pill , " dropping its appeal of a judge 's order requiring it to be sold over the counter			1
@entity12 district judge @entity11 had ruled in april that the government must allow over-the - counter sales , and a federal appeals court rejected the administration 's challenge to that ruling last week			1
the administration had been criticized by some women 's rights groups for trying to stop contraception sales to underage females			1
in a monday letter to @entity11 , @entity23 attorneys said the @entity25 and the @entity26 had agreed to make the single - pill version of the drug available " without age or point - of - sale restrictions			1
" " it is the government 's understanding that this course of action fully complies with the @entity37 's judgment in this action , " the letter states			0
" once the @entity37 confirms that the government 's understanding is correct , the government intends to file with the @entity37 notice that it is voluntarily withdrawing its appeal in this matter			2
" the @entity25 has asked the maker of the single - pill emergency contraceptive known as @entity46 one - step to submit a new request for over-the - counter approval , the letter states			1
the agency " will approve it without delay " once filed			0
but the @entity25 wo n't allow girls to obtain a two - pill version of the drug , saying there is less safety data available on the use of the product by younger adolescents			1
an @entity2 administration official told @entity0 on tuesday that the latest court ruling meant that a version of the drug would have to be made available over the counter , and if the administration had appealed , it would have been the two - pill version			1
facing that reality , officials decided to move forward with the one - pill version rather than letting the two - pill configuration hit the market , the official said			1
the key ingredient in @entity46 is the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel , which can prevent fertilization or prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus			0
emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours			0
the @entity25 announced two years ago there would be no limits on over-the - counter sales of morning - after pills			1
but @entity26 secretary @entity85 unilaterally ordered the age and prescription restrictions , prompting lawsuits			2
sen. @entity89 , @entity90 , praised the decision			0
" after far too long of a delay , science has prevailed , " said @entity92 , who called emergency contraception " an essential part of women 's basic health care			0
" " today 's move by the administration means the safety and effectiveness of @entity46 , not politics , will dictate access , " she said			2
and the abortion rights group @entity106 said the decision " ends a nearly decade - long battle over lowering barriers to this important medication			2
" " health experts like the @entity116 and many others agree that emergency contraception is safe and effective for women of all ages , " @entity111 , president of the rights group , said in a statement hailing the move			0
" we 're happy to see this long overdue victory for science over politics			0
" the move is likely to draw criticism from opponents of abortion rights , who had condemned @entity11 's april ruling			2
@entity11 had criticized what he called " nonsensical " government rules that he said unfairly favored the single - pill version over the cheaper , generic two - pill version			1
under current policies , prescriptions are still needed for the generic version for those under age 17			0
supporters of @entity11 's ruling called it a landmark decision , while opponents raised concerns about safeguards being eliminated			1
the @entity25 said in may that it was changing its regulations , allowing sales by a private pharmaceutical firm , @entity146 , to those 15 and over without a prescription			2
only those 17 or older were previously allowed to buy the contraceptive			0
many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives , including @entity153 and most of @entity154			0
other countries sell the pill without a prescription .			0

new : decision keeps two - pill version of drug off over-the - counter market , official says
the @entity25 says it will allow over-the - counter sales of one - pill product
a federal judge in @entity169 had ordered the drug be made available without restrictions
the @entity2 administration 's appeal of that ruling was *rebuffed* last week
