@entity0 won the first @entity3 clash in nearly three years as two first half goals sunk ailing @entity6 rival @entity5 at @entity7 sunday in their @entity8 semifinal			1
the bitter rivalry between the two clubs which have dominated @entity12 football for decades is well chronicled , but @entity0 's superiority as @entity14 and @entity15 found the target took the heat out of the fixture			1
it was the 400th competitive meeting , but first since april 2012 , shortly before cash - strapped @entity5 was liquidated and forced to re-form as a new entity in the bottom flight of the @entity12 leagues			2
the 2 - 0 win for @entity0 reflected the current status of the two clubs , one topping the @entity25 , the other struggling to catch @entity27 in the battle for the automatic promotion spot from the second flight			1
@entity5 had hoped for redemption in the cup competition , but it is @entity0 who will face @entity35 in the final on march 15			1
@entity14 headed home the opener on 10 minutes and @entity15 blasted home the second just after the half hour mark			1
@entity0 was content to soak up sporadic @entity5 pressure in the second half , with keeper @entity44 barely tested			1
it left manager @entity45 satisfied with his team 's efforts			0
" i think 2 - 0 was a fair result , " he said			1
" in the first half we had four chances and we scored two which was okay			0
the second half we did n't have many but they did n't have a shot on target either			0
" @entity5 -- without a permanent manager since the departure of @entity58 -- and still beset by boardroom wrangles -- will now be left to focus on its bid to win promotion back to the @entity25			2
if it succeeds the @entity3 matches will again become regular fixtures -- a welcome boost to the finances of both clubs -- as they are played to capacity audiences with extra television revenues			2
sunday 's game was beamed live to 54 countries			0
@entity73 rout meanwhile , in the @entity74 , @entity73 continued its recent charge with a 5 - 0 rout of struggling @entity77 , without a goal in the last six league games			1
the match at the @entity81 was entirely one - sided and the @entity82 took the lead on eight minutes when @entity84 scored after an assist from @entity86			0
@entity87 international @entity86 added the second with the impressive @entity89 , watched by @entity91 manager @entity90 , grabbing the third			0
@entity92 scored the fourth from the penalty spot with @entity96 's 30 - yard effort completing a fine afternoon for @entity98 's men			0
@entity73 has now taken 19 points from a possible 24 and risen to fifth , leapfrogging north @entity102 neighbor @entity100			2
fourth - placed @entity103 later suffered a shock 1 - 0 home defeat to @entity106 , ending with 10 men after @entity108 was sent off in the second half			2
@entity110 scored the @entity106 goal after 83 minutes of a tight encounter			0
@entity114 magic @entity116 's title hopes in @entity117 stayed on track but the @entity120 giants had to twice come from behind to beat @entity121 3 - 2 in the @entity122			1
@entity123 put the visitors ahead after half an hour , only for @entity125 to level just before the interval			0
@entity127 restored the @entity121 lead on 51 minutes but it was shortlived as @entity130 leveled two minutes later			0
@entity114 had been involved in that goal and he put @entity116 into the lead for the first time with a fine strike after an assist by @entity135			1
the win lifts @entity116 to just one point behind leaders @entity139 , but having played a game more .			0
