@entity0 , @entity1 -- i did n't need to read the findings of a recent @entity6 research study to know that most women who live with their mates have more body fat than those who do n't			1
for 10 years , researchers studied nearly 6,500 women , age 18 to 23 , and found , according to one of the study 's authors , dr. @entity13 , that " women with no partner and no baby averaged 11 pounds over 10 years			1
with a partner and no baby they gained about 15 pounds , and if they had a partner and a baby they gained 20 pounds			1
" ( the findings appear in the february issue of the @entity25			2
) researchers can speculate on the reasons for this , but it 's not news to me			2
of the thousands of women i 've met who are desperately seeking to reshape their bodies , almost all are living with -- or just moved away from -- a partner			1
while i have heard many voices , their story is the same : they lust , then love			2
with lust comes starvation ; with love , over-consumption and under - exercise			1
their love transforms from the physical to the emotional , and this usually happens after they decide to live together			2
but once they lift their heads above the fog of love , they look down to find that their butts are sagging , bellies are bulging and thighs have taken on interesting new shapes ! come to think of it , many of the men who knock on my door looking for their abdominal muscles also deteriorated soon after moving in with their mates			1
does he have the same waistline measurement as when you first signed the lease or mortgage papers ? probably not			2
in fact , it probably got even worse for both of you after your first child , did n't it ? ( the new @entity6 research references an earlier study that showed an increase in obesity in men once they 'd had children			1
) like the smokers i know , the overwhelming majority of whom hate to smoke , many women develop unhealthy patterns ( like snacking on junk food at home ) that lead to unhealthy bodies , which lead to a seriously unhealthy lack of self - esteem			1
we become " less desirable , " a phrase i hear far too often			2
once we arrive at this place , the frantic search begins			0
many of us will do anything to recover what was once our youthful body			0
sadly , many waste time and money on fad diets , pills and potions			0
they end up doing the yo - yo thing , torturing their bodies through obsessive experimentation with an endless list of exercise programs , almost all of which fail them , because the will to really change behavior is not yet there			1
so , what can we do ? first , we must think about the quality and standards of our everyday behavior more than the end result			0
if we can just focus on gradual improvement of our diet and our exercise programs , we will likely regain our healthier , slimmer form			1
but more important , we will also build our self - respect			0
so , taking intelligent steps ( i.e. , coming up with a rational workout plan or shopping for fresher and healthier foods and eating them , not impulse snacks ) , carrying the steps out consistently -- more frequently and for a longer duration -- will have a huge net benefit on our bottoms and our bottom line : love			1
next , we should include our mates in our process			0
in my experience , for example , couples who work out together have greater success in achieving their health and weight loss goals			1
they also seem to get along much better and stay together longer			0
transform your personal physical development time into " date time , " doing something as simple as taking regular after - dinner walks together			0
finally , cut back , but do n't cut out the fun stuff			0
when we are consistent with our diet and exercise programs , there is no need for maniacal starvation			1
we do n't need to sit at the dinner table with a radish on our plate , while our children and mates enjoy full meals			0
a healthy diet should not be some kind of intruder in our relationships , it should be a natural part of our lives			2
besides , fun foods are what make our love lives more interesting and memorable			0
so eat ! but only if you do the work on the other side of those calories			0
having a healthy , fit and feminine physique and a deeply loving emotional relationship are not mutually exclusive			0
you can have both ; and it can be done in a fun and positive way			0
for those of you about to move in , heed this advice : start your program now , before your belly and your mate 's interest start to sag ! i promise : if you do n't quit , you 'll have a body that wo n't quit ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1
