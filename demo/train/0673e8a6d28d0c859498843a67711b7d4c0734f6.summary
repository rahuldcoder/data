are the odds still ever in our favor ? ' @entity3 : @entity7 1 " has hit theaters , and critics seem divided on whether it 's a strong offering			1
politics is a star , as much as @entity11 's rebel @entity10 , in the latest installment of the popular franchise			2
adapted from the the third novel in the young adult series by @entity17 , the film finds @entity10 stepping firmly into her role as leader in the fight against the authoritarian - totalitarian regime of @entity22			1
@entity23 of the @entity24 notes the controversy that has surrounded the decision to make two movies out of the third book and writes " but this latest film , which @entity30 directed from a screenplay by @entity32 and @entity33 , proves to be much more than scene - setting			1
" " it 's about the power of political symbols , and the danger of becoming one -- about @entity10 staying true to herself , and to those she loves , while her handlers seek to reshape her into some sort of sci - fi @entity42 , " he writes			2
the wrap 's @entity44 finds that the new film " calls to mind smart political comedies like ' @entity47 ' and ' @entity48			1
' " " returning director @entity30 finds interesting visual moments , even in the underground bunker , " @entity44 writes			0
" at one point , @entity10 looks down on rows and rows of rebels climbing down , down , down a metallic triangular staircase , and it 's like something out of " @entity59			0
" that 's a pretty bold quotation to make for a film that 's also about a proletariat revolution , but even if " @entity66 " is n't on the level of that silent classic , it 's not an altogether inappropriate reference point			2
" but @entity68 of @entity69 pins @entity7 1 as " an overgrown and bloated trailer for a film yet to come			1
" " unfortunately , ' @entity7 1 ' has all the personality of an industrial film , " he says			1
" there 's not a drop of insolence , insubordination or insurrection running through its veins ; it feels like a manufactured product through and through , ironic and sad given its revolutionary theme			0
" @entity83 's movie critic , @entity82 , writes of the parallel themes of teen romance and revolution in the film			1
@entity10 is torn between feelings for @entity89 ( @entity90 ) , who is now in the custody of the @entity92 , and fellow freedom fighter @entity94 ( @entity93 )			0
" war and teenage angst make for uncomfortable narrative bedfellows , but at least the political violence that rips through the fictional country of @entity22 is neither glossed over nor trivialized , " @entity82 writes , noting the film 's pg - 13 rating for scenes that include executions and mass slaughter			2
" and @entity11 is actress enough to invest even @entity10 ' comparatively low - stakes struggle with some dramatic heft			0
" indeed , it appears that the acting may be part of the saving grace for the film according to some			1
@entity114 of @entity115 praises @entity30 and her fellow cast members , including @entity118 and the late @entity119			0
" @entity11 reveals greater depth and emotional layers as rebel leader @entity10 and is bolstered by powerhouse supporting performances , " @entity114 writes			0
" new to the dystopian franchise , @entity118 plays @entity92 president @entity125 with just the right blend of stern authority and humanity			0
her right - hand man is the once - sinister , now - wearied @entity130 , played perfectly by @entity119			0
