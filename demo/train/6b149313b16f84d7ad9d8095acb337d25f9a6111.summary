@entity0 -- ever since @entity5 became the shorthand for a government run amok , the political @entity2 © of our time has been about the political lesson of that era : that the coverup can be worse than the crime			2
apply that @entity2 © to @entity12 -- and questions about the motive for removing the terror link from talking points about the @entity17 attack in the heat of an election			1
maybe there 's a corollary question that we ought to be asking : in politics , when did spin trump everything , even the truth ? we 're in dangerous territory right now , although the president himself seems to be having none of it , calling the investigation a " political circus			1
but in the center ring is something that still begs an explanation , despite the president 's dismissiveness : how -- and why -- did the account of what happened at @entity12 ( i.e. the infamous talking points ) go through a dozen iterations , beginning with a fairly detailed description of the potential involvement of @entity46 that morphed over the course of a day into a simple , gauzy , bland ( and false ) theory ? administration officials say , of course , that this is just part of the regular , interagency " process " of consultation that occurs before information is released			1
in other words , this is the way intelligence always gets scrubbed and vetted			2
and in this case , do n't forget , the information was being released to members of @entity61 on the intelligence committees , so they could speak in public with some clarity ( ! ) on @entity12			1
but that also means the information was going to @entity67 -- in the heat of the fall election -- so antennae were up			2
what 's more , the bureaucratic armor was on -- between people at the @entity74 and the @entity75 , each trying to make sure their agency was n't thrown under the bus for the obvious failures in @entity12			2
all in all , just another day in @entity0			2
let 's try to deconstruct the accusations			2
first , the notion that politics was somehow at play is , of course , true			0
was it 30 % or 50 % or 80 % of the problem ? hard to say			0
what we do know is this : in an e-mail , @entity91 , the @entity74 's spokeswoman at the time , makes the point that a key paragraph in the talking points -- containing context and detail about five other attacks in @entity12 -- " could be abused by members of @entity61 to beat up the @entity74 for not paying attention to warnings so why would we feed that either ... " she 's right : republicans and @entity103 would no doubt have accused the administration of not paying enough attention to warning signs			1
but since it was also the truth -- or an important part of it -- why suppress it ? then there 's the rest of the story , which may even be more dispositive			0
although the @entity115 ambassador to @entity17 lost his life , the exact nature of the @entity12 operation is tricky			0
@entity118 spokesman @entity117 says the @entity118 changed the wording from " consulate " to " diplomatic facility " to be more accurate			0
so what does that mean ? thanks to the digging of @entity127 in the @entity128 , it looks very much like the @entity12 consulate " was not a consulate at all but basically a secret @entity75 operation			0
" and , as @entity127 also points out , the internal @entity134 , in its investigation , tiptoed around the delicate matter : the @entity115 @entity138 in @entity12 , it said , " was never a consulate and never formally notified to the @entity17 government			1
" in other words , this was a hit on a @entity75 outpost , resulting in the death of an ambassador who happened to be there at the time			0
that helps to explain the pushback from the @entity74 , which was publicly taking the heat -- and did n't want the @entity75 - driven talking points to add to the idea that they had failed to protect their own			1
in addition , @entity74 had been pretty mum on the whole picture , and @entity91 did n't want the talking points to reflect more than she had been allowed to share publicly , so she naturally objected -- on behalf of her " building 's leadership			1
" the bottom line : that the more complex version of the truth -- previous recent attacks , previous threats linked to @entity46 , the presence of " islamic extremists " -- was somehow lost in translation and what emerged instead was something that turned out to be utterly false : a claim that the attack was " spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity115 embassy in @entity172			1
" in the end , there are two parts to this @entity12 brouhaha			0
the president called the controversy a " sideshow , " and he 's right : @entity67 are trying to fund - raise off of this and hurt @entity181			2
and maybe the president was goading them , knowing that if they go overboard , the public will turn on them			1
but the president 's dismissive attitude towards the whole mess willfully neglects the second part of the problem			1
he says , incredulously , " who executes some sort of coverup or effort to tamp things down for three days ? so the whole thing defies logic			0
" alas , it does n't			0
nothing in life happens in a vacuum , and life in @entity0 is no different			0
in the context of the closing months of a presidential campaign , three days can be an eternity			0
and spinning across the finish line is all that counts			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			1

@entity210 : when does spin go overboard , and out of control ?
she asks : how did a broad *assessment* involving terror turn into a bland , false theory ?
bureaucrats took mention of @entity46 out of the points *distributed* to @entity61 , others , she says
@entity210 : president @entity226 neglects key point that the public was misled
