@entity0 -- a titanic courtroom showdown with billions of dollars in the balance opened in @entity0 on monday , with oil giant @entity4 arguing it should n't face the government 's steepest penalties for the 2010 @entity8 oil spill			1
@entity4 already pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to a record - setting $ 4 billion fine for the spill			1
but it could face more than $ 20 billion in additional environmental penalties if found to have committed gross negligence in the disaster			2
in a packed federal courtroom monday afternoon , @entity4 attorney @entity15 said blame for the disaster was n't the oil company 's alone			1
a string of bad decisions by @entity22 , the company that owned the doomed drill rig @entity24 ; well cement contractor @entity25 ; and @entity4 all led to the blowout , he said			1
" we do not believe that men and women of @entity4 behaved in willful misconduct , " @entity15 said			2
" it was a multiparty event			1
" but @entity25 attorney @entity32 said @entity4 ignored the contractor 's recommendations about the cement job and that @entity22 did n't move fast enough to contain the blowout			1
@entity22 settled with the government last week for $ 1 billion in @entity39 penalties but could face additional additional liability in the case that started monday			0
@entity22 lawyer @entity42 said that last week 's settlement was not an admission of gross negligence and that last - minute changes to the well design by @entity4 had the rig 's crew " at wits ' end " before the disaster			1
all three companies have been pointing fingers at each other since the april 20 , 2010 , blowout that sank the @entity24 , killed 11 men aboard and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed for nearly three months			0
the spill 's effects on the environment are still being cataloged			2
the plaintiffs in the civil case that opened monday include five @entity65 , individuals , businesses and the federal government			0
" evidence will show @entity4 placed huge financial pressure to cut costs , cut corners , and rush the job , " attorney @entity69 , who represents the coalition of plaintiffs , said during opening arguments on monday			1
and @entity79 attorney general @entity78 said the oil giant " was blinded by their bottom line			0
" " the spill was tragically inevitable due to @entity4 's corporate culture , " @entity78 said			1
" the evidence will show that , at @entity4 , money mattered most			2
" if it is found to have been " grossly negligent " under the @entity39 , it could be fined as much as $ 4,300 per barrel of oil spilled into the @entity8			1
if it 's found " negligent , " the company could be fined about $ 1,100 per barrel			2
attorneys will also likely square off over how much oil gushed into the gulf , another key figure that will be used to calculate how much money @entity4 might owe			2
officials have said 4.9 million barrels -- about 205 million gallons -- of oil spilled , while @entity4 says that number is overblown and that authorities should use a maximum figure of 3.1 million barrels of oil when calculating the fine			2
the trial will also determine what fines the company faces under @entity104 , which aims to restore environmental damage caused by the spill			1
environmental groups want to see those fines -- which will put a specific price tag on damage to plants and wildlife -- total around $ 25 billion			0
with so much money at stake , each side has brought an army of lawyers to the fight			0
with almost 60 lawyers filling the courtroom , the judge created a seating chart for all the attorneys			0
lawyers representing the federal government and other plaintiffs sat on one side , while the @entity4 lawyers and other companies ' lawyers sat across the room			0
three overflow courtrooms were also packed on monday			0
@entity4 says it has already paid billions in spill - related cleanup and compensation costs and has been barred from new federal contracts			1
though @entity25 and @entity22 could also face penalties , much of the criticism from environmentalists before the high - profile trial has focused on @entity4 , the undersea well 's owner			1
" the damage done here is real , both to the environment and to the people , " said @entity142 , of the @entity143			0
" and @entity4 should not have the chance to get off cheaply on this			0
" in his statement before the trial began , @entity4 general counsel @entity149 said the company would push for the court to consider lower penalties , arguing that @entity4 made efforts to do the right thing and " immediately stepped up " and acknowledged its role in the spill			1
" to date we 've spent more than $ 23 billion in response , cleanup , and payments on claims by individuals , businesses and governments , " he said			0
" no company has done more , faster , to meet its commitment to economic and environmental restoration efforts in the wake of an industrial accident			0
" @entity1 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity8 oil spill was " a multiparty event , " @entity4 lawyer argues
billions of dollars are at stake as a judge weighs negligence and financial penalties
@entity4 is fighting to limit fines , while the company 's critics hope to see a *landmark* *punishment*
