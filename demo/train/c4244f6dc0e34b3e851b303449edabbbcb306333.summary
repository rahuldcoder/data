@entity1 may have won four grand slams but following defeats in 2005 , 2006 , 2011 and 2012 , she would love to add a success in @entity23 to those triumphs			1
@entity26 's @entity25 is the defending champion , furthering the @entity2 's @entity3 misery last year to add to previous final failures against @entity29 ( 2011 ) , @entity30 ( 2006 ) and @entity31 ( 2005 )			1

she may have won their previous three meetings but @entity1 was still forced to save three set points on her own serve in the second set before eventually prevailing			1

a few ups and downs in the match but i 'm really happy to get through			0
" the victory , which took two hours and 29 minutes to complete , was the second in successive tournaments for the @entity2 over @entity13			1

in the men 's draw , @entity70 's conqueror @entity69 moved into the last four with a convincing win against 11th seed @entity74			2

i felt pretty comfortable after that , " the 34 - year - old former world @entity38 told the tournament 's official website			0
" i used my chances right away in the second set and took that momentum			0
again , i played the way i wanted to , using my all - around game and variety			0
i think i did that pretty well tonight			0
" next up for @entity69 is third seed @entity95 , who came from one set down to defeat @entity97 's @entity96 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 0			1
@entity98 's @entity95 will be hoping to reach the final of this event for the first time in his career , having been a semifinalist in 2005 and 2006			1
he also has more match wins than any other player on the @entity106 this year , with wednesday 's win over @entity96 his 24th of 2013			2
" i was a little bit nervous in the first set and part of the second , " said the 30 - year - old @entity95			2
