@entity0 -- for table tennis players @entity3 and @entity4 , competing at the @entity5 marks the climax of a remarkable journey			1
" it 's really kind of awesome , " @entity3 told @entity1			1
" it 's kind of surreal , the chances of it happening -- i thought we probably would 've done a better job with winning the lottery than for us both to be able to do it again , 20 - something years later			2
" the @entity18 pair first took part in 1984 at @entity20 , outside @entity0 , but then lost touch with each other			1
they retired from the game to concentrate on other aspects of life -- in @entity3 's case , on her first love , wheelchair basketball			1
but after each separately decided to take up table tennis again just a few years ago , they were reunited by chance in 2008			1
@entity34 history comes full circle at @entity36 in the course of catching up they conjured up a dream : to play together at the @entity5 , 28 years after they first traveled to the @entity40 as naive 19 - year - olds to represent their country			1
the idea had an added piquancy because it was @entity3 who had first introduced @entity45 to table tennis -- also known as ping pong -- at the @entity49 college where they met in 1983			1
but could they pull it off ? it was n't going to be easy to make the grade for selection nearly three decades later			1
aspects of the game had changed , rules had evolved -- and their rivals for coveted spots on the @entity61 paralympic squad could be of any age			1
what do the @entity34 mean to you ? undaunted , they set about getting themselves back up to speed through dedicated training ; @entity3 in the @entity68 area and @entity45 in her home state of @entity70 , aided by coach @entity71			1
they traveled the globe last year to gain world ranking points in @entity75 tournaments , taking in everywhere from @entity77 to @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity82			0
@entity3 's place in the @entity61 squad was confirmed in january this year			1
then came an anxious wait to see if @entity45 had made it into the last spot in her disability class			0
finally the news they had both been praying for came through in march -- she was in			0
@entity4 , 47 , was overjoyed by the news			1
" it means a lot to me , " she said			0
" the older you get , the more you appreciate the things in life			0
" as 19 - year - olds , @entity45 and @entity3 played singles at the 1984 games rather than doubles , partly because they fall into different classification bands			1
the complex @entity34 system is intended to make sure athletes compete against others with the same level of impairment			2
but this time around they will be competing both individually and in the team event			0
@entity3 is aware of how much things have changed for @entity34 athletes over the years			1
" back in those days , you had to pay your own way			0
if you could n't afford it , you could n't go , so you had to fundraise , " she recalled			0
" the uniforms were so ugly nobody wanted them			0
" despite more than two decades out of touch , the friends still have many things in common			1
@entity3 has two sons , one in the military and the other starting college , while @entity45 has one ; all three boys are very close in age			2
@entity45 is accompanied on the trip to @entity0 by her husband , @entity128 -- who was introduced to her by @entity3 when they were all students at @entity130 , in @entity131			2
they will celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary in @entity0			0
both women were also successful able - bodied athletes before each suffered a devastating accident while a teenager			0
before meeting @entity3 in college , @entity4 thought she would never practice sport again after a diving accident left her paralyzed from the chest down in 1979			1
she still appreciates what @entity3 did in introducing her to life as a disabled athlete			2
@entity3 had played high school basketball before she was paralyzed in an automobile accident at age 16			1
the impact , in the days before seat belt laws came into force , sent her flying from the passenger seat through the windscreen			0
she broke her back , among other injuries , but a month after leaving the hospital she was at her first wheelchair basketball practice			2
" i did n't have that period of ' @entity157 is me , ' " @entity3 said			2
" i was right back in it			0
" just over a year later , in 1982 , she made her first trip overseas to play table tennis			1
but after competing at the 1984 @entity34 , @entity3 retired from the sport to focus on her beloved hoops instead , eventually retiring as an international basketball player in 2002			1
five years later , @entity3 took up table tennis again			1
she tried for the @entity165 squad in 2008 but just missed out on a place			0
" i knew i was close to the level , so i said , ' ok -- there 's another four years			0
if i work really hard , try hard , stay on track , maybe i can make the next one			2
' " when a fellow table tennis player then put her in touch with @entity4 , who had picked up the game again in 2008 , their shared dream was born			1
since then , they have spoken almost every day , said @entity3			2
the fact they are returning to the @entity40 , where they played in their first @entity34 , makes its realization all the more special			0
" it 's back where we started -- it 's kind of like i went through a full circle , " said @entity3			2
" we worked really , really had to get where we are and it 's been a fun journey for the most part			0
" both are down - to - earth about their achievements , despite their inspirational history			0
@entity45 runs two senior table tennis programs , while @entity3 's work as an adjunct professor teaching kinesiology , the study of body movement , at @entity198 in @entity199 , means she can also share her love of sport			1
" i 've never really thought of myself as an inspiration -- i just feel that i am blessed to be an athlete			0
i 've been an athlete my entire life , " @entity3 said			2
" if i can help someone along the way , change someone 's attitude about people with disabilities , help people to learn something , then that 's a good day			0
" the chance to represent the @entity18 once again at the @entity34 is a " true honor , " she said			0
" that is one of the greatest honors you can have as an athlete , to represent your country , and your community , and yourself and your family			0

@entity3 and @entity4 are playing table tennis at the @entity5
they first competed in the @entity228 in 1984 and are *delighted* to make @entity61 again
both *embraced* wheelchair sport after they were paralyzed as teenagers in accidents
they lost touch for more than two decades before being reunited through table tennis
