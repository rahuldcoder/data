you eat too much sugar			2
i know you do n't think so , but you do			0
look at your daily ritual : coffee with two packets of sugar in the morning , maybe with a bagel or doughnut or yogurt			1
a soda with your salad for lunch and maybe a cookie for dessert			0
we 're not even to dinner yet and already you 've already had more sugar than you need			2
@entity17 not only makes you fat , it may make you sick we 're talking about added sugar here , the sugar in processed and manufactured foods -- sugary drinks , sodas and juices , cakes and cookies , candy , processed cereals , salad dressings and breads			1
this is different from naturally occurring sugar , the stuff you find in an apple or orange or ear of corn			2
added sugar is often what manufacturers put in to make food taste better			1
but a new study says that extra sugar could be killing you			1
@entity44 is eating way too much added sugar and a new study published in @entity47 shows it			1
researchers set out to evaluate how much sugar participants consume and look at the association between added sugar consumption and cardiovascular mortality			1
most adults in the study , which looked at average adult sugar consumption between 2005 and 2010 , ate or drank more than 10 % of their total calories in added sugar			1
about one in 10 adults took in 25 % or more of calories from added sugar			1
the @entity59 says that our daily sugar intake should not be more than 25 % of total calories consumed			1
the @entity63 says this number should be no more than 10 %			1
the @entity65 recommends no more than 6 teaspoons or 24 grams ( 100 calories a day ) of sugar for women and no more than 9 teaspoons or 36 grams ( 150 calories day ) for men			2
using this model , let 's go back and take a look at your daily food intake			2
breakfast : coffee w / 2 packets of sugar = 8 grams of @entity80 = 6 grams / 10 grams of sugar lunch : salad w / @entity83 dressing = 2 grams of @entity84 ( 12 oz ) = 35 grams of @entity86 chip cookie = 5 grams of @entity87 = 56 - 60 grams of sugar @entity65 recommendation = 24 grams / day ( women ) , 36 grams / day ( men ) according to this recommendation you would have exceeded your sugar allotment by noon			2
that 's before your afternoon snack or big dinner			0
as a doctor , i see the consequences of excessive sugar intake every day			1
i have adult obese patients -- those with a body mass index of 30 or higher			0
for a man 5 - feet - 9 - inches tall , that 's about 40 pounds or more over his ideal weight for his height , according to the @entity108			0
but even more frightening are the morbidly obese children i see			0
they are starting too early down the wrong , deadly path			0
obesity is a multifactorial condition and ca n't be blamed solely on excessive sugar intake , but it certainly plays a pretty major factor			1
then there are patients with diabetes , heart disease , high blood pressure and high cholesterol			2
many studies have shown a direct association between excess sugar and these conditions			2
this particular study takes this one step further by suggesting that increased added sugar causes increased cardiovascular mortality			1
in the study , those who consumed approximately 17 % to 21 % of calories from added sugar had a 38 % higher risk of cardiovascular disease mortality -- that means death because of heart or blood vessel failure -- than those who consumed approximately 8 % of calories from added sugar			1
but studies are one thing			0
when you see a grandmother who has lost her foot because of poor circulation as a result of diabetes , it is sad			0
when she comes in with her grandson who is 50 pounds overweight and needs medicine to treat his hypertension , it is a downright tragedy			0
this is a wake - up call			0
@entity44 , it 's time to cut back on added sugars			1
limit your intake of soda and other sugary drinks such as fruit juices			0
look at the labels on that bottle of green tea or so - called energy bar , there is likely sugar there , too			0
minimize the intake of processed foods			0
look for yourself to see how much sugar is in the foods that you are eating			0
what you find may surprise you , and may be killing you .			0

dr. @entity180 looks at how our daily rituals are putting way too much sugar into our bodies
new study shows many @entity44 consume more than 10 % of their calories from added sugar
excessive sugar consumption increases chances of cardiovascular disease , death
