-- it started a few years ago , as i was spiraling down one of @entity5 's endless information rabbit holes			0
i already had as many trains of thought as i had tabs open , and yet , somewhere between @entity10 and the chemical properties of copper , another little thought managed to burrow a space for itself : i started to consider the process by which all this information had been amassed , ordered , published and argued over -- the massive collaborative effort shared amongst so many contributors , and the exponential benefit such a resource provided			1
over time that initial little moment of wonder grew into a fascination with the culture around shared information - code and designs that can be studied , modified , and redistributed by anyone , for any purpose			1
check out this demo of @entity31 pen but no matter how many documentaries i watched , books i read , and blogs i followed , i remained a spectator			0
the conversation about remix culture and self - replicating machines was between hackers , engineers and @entity42 professors , and i did n't feel i could contribute			2
i made music videos , not circuit boards			2
before this year i had never used a 3d printer , never written a line of code , and about the only thing i could make myself was an omelette			2
but in this inexperience i saw an opportunity to share the story and the struggles of a complete beginner , trying everything for the first time			2
since august 1 2012 i 've been living a " year of @entity57 , " exploring how the systems and culture of free and open - source software work in other areas			1
for a year , i 'm using or developing products and projects that are shared under open licenses , made to be copied or built upon by others -- which also means not buying any traditionally copyrighted or patented products			1
i 've been applying this concept to as many areas of my life as possible and documenting the results in blogs and videos			0
digital tattoos , mind - reading headphones : the shape of things to come ? some lifestyle changes have been welcome -- swapping @entity81 software for @entity82 was much easier than i expected , and i 'm never going back			2
" researching " open source beer is also a pleasure			1
people often ask me what i miss. without any hesitation , it 's cinema ! open - source , remix - friendly films are n't too common			1
i have n't been to the movies in 10 months and it takes just the faintest murmur from the nearby open air cinema before i find myself anxiously wiping phantom popcorn grease from my fingers			1
similarly , avoiding " all rights reserved " music has left me with a hollowed - out collection : some dusty public domain blues , and a sparse selection of new music under certain @entity104 licenses			1
if you were to compare my music library before , and my music library now , you could never claim it was an improvement			2
but this project is not about what i 'm missing out on			0
the value of my new music is that it 's truly mine to use however i like			2
when you 're expressly given permission to use something , it starts a creative process			0
i use open - source photos , video and music freely in the videos i make , promoting the original artists while allowing my work to be remixed and reused by others in the same way			1
using the commons means i never have to start from zero			0
i 'm currently creating an open educational curriculum for teaching video editing , but i can use existing ideas , resources and examples as a framework			1
@entity132 : open source ' @entity134 for adults ' my diy skills have come a long way -- making scarves , wine , soap and toothpaste , though it seems like whittling sticks when compared to the possibilities of open hardware and digital manufacturing			1
the online sharing of 3d files allows people around the world to collaborate and create intricate physical objects using laser cutters , 3d printers and @entity155 mills			0
it 's not as easy as clicking " print " but i 've been able to develop projects that would be impossible using traditional techniques			0
thanks to the help from @entity161 and her hacked knitting machine i was able to survive the @entity163 winter with an open source woolly hat			1
its pattern draws on public - domain snowflake images , and a knitted qr code leads to the hat 's source files			1
although @entity31 - printed underwear is a long way off ( plastic chain mail , anyone ? ) i thought computers could still take some of the difficulty out of making your own clothes			0
people do n't all fit neatly into small , medium and large , and patterns should reflect that			0
at my local co-sewing space i met a talented tailor and designer who helped me make a parametric underwear pattern -- you type in your waist measurement , and the pattern adjusts its shape to fit			0
read this : my open - source cure for brain cancer this community is growing fast			1
@entity163 's first @entity196 is just starting to plug in the 3d printers and warm up the soldering irons , already attracting a diverse collection of people who are exploring digital manufacturing for the first time			0
with each step there are technical challenges , and other difficulties along the way -- a lack of budget , as well as the time spent researching and organizing collaborations			0
i have n't yet tackled big issues like an open - source approach to electricity , internet service or land access , and i 'm running out of time			1
on august 1 2013 , the restrictions will stop and , yes , i 'm heading straight to the movies			0
but now , i need no impetus to look for open - source solutions wherever possible -- it 's automatic			1
the year might be ending , but this process is not			0
the main lesson i 've learned is that if you want to make things yourself , if you want to help others , or express yourself creatively , you do n't need any special skills or background to get started			0
there is an ever - growing wealth of information , tools and designs in the commons , which you already have permission to use			0
