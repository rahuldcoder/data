the manuscript was rediscovered last year , @entity3 , 88 , said in a statement from her publisher , @entity15			1
" in the mid- 1950s , i completed a novel called ' @entity6 , ' " she said			1
" it features the character known as @entity9 as an adult woman , and i thought it a pretty decent effort			0
my editor , who was taken by the flashbacks to @entity9 's childhood , persuaded me to write a novel ( what became ' @entity5 ' ) from the point of view of the young scout			1
" i was a first - time writer , so i did as i was told			0
i had n't realized it ( the original book ) had survived , so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer @entity34 discovered it			2
after much thought and hesitation , i shared it with a handful of people i trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication			0
i am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years			0
" " @entity44 " is set in the 1950s and is about @entity9 -- @entity45 -- returning to her hometown of @entity5 , @entity47 ( a fictional version of @entity3 's hometown of @entity50 ) , to see her father , the upright lawyer @entity51			1
" she is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father 's attitude toward society , and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood , " the press release said			2
" to kill a mockingbird , " which @entity3 wrote after she moved to @entity63 , made her name			1
the book , published in 1960 , won the @entity65 and was made into a beloved 1962 film			1
@entity67 won the @entity68 for best actor for his portrayal of @entity51			0
it 's a mainstay of high school reading lists and , as of 2006 , had sold more than 30 million copies			2
@entity3 , who returned to @entity50 several years ago , remembers being caught off - guard by its overwhelming success			1
" i ca n't say that ( my reaction ) was one of surprise			0
it was one of sheer numbness			0
it was like being hit over the head and knocked cold , " she said in 1964			0
until now , it had been her only published novel			0
@entity86 , @entity15 's senior vice president and publisher , called " @entity6 " " a remarkable literary event			1
" " the existence of ' @entity6 ' was unknown until recently , and its discovery is an extraordinary gift to the many readers and fans of ' @entity5 , ' " he said in the statement			1

" @entity106 at @entity50 's chamber of commerce said news of the book was " great news			1
" " our main street director told me and she had heard it from the book store			2
it 's definitely great news , " she told @entity2			2
" everyone has always speculated about a second book			2
everyone who read ( ' mockingbird ' ) has said , ' oh i wish she had written another book			2
