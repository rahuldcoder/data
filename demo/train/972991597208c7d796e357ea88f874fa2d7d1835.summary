-- can ideas get you high ? my approach to creating content is focused on pulling people out of their intellectual comfort zones			1
i 'm interested in presenting ideas in unique ways that challenge people to question their assumptions			1
my mode of presentation is short - form video -- basically i create fast cut , impassioned " idea explainers " that explode with enthusiasm and intensity as they distill how technology is expanding our sphere of possibility			1
i want big ideas to have aesthetic relevance			1
i want to tickle people 's intellectual sensibilities and instill a sense of wonder			1
i think big ideas should get people high ! my short videos , which i call shots of philosophical espresso , are trailers for these ideas			1
they are not a substitute for a book or academic paper -- they are instigators			2
my work is simply another way for wider audiences to engage with these ideas			1
my goal is for those who might not be inclined toward heady discourse to find a way still to connect to these ideas			1
psychologist @entity50 coined the term " the biological advantage of being awestruck " to describe his theory on why our unique ability to be enthralled was , somehow , biologically selected for in a @entity57 sense			1
he believes this quirk of our consciousness imbues our lives with a sense of cosmic significance that over the course of history has resulted in a species that works harder not just to survive but to flourish and thrive			1
to " awe " gives us a " raison d'etre			2
" a reason for being			2
you can learn more about @entity50 's idea in my video " @entity73			2
" @entity50 says being enchanted by the magic of experience , rather than being just an aid to survival , provides an essential incentive to survive			2
" we relish just being here , " he says			2
" we feel the yen to confirm and renew , in small ways or large , our own occupancy of the present moment , to go deeper , to extend it , to revel in being there , and when we have the skill , to celebrate it in words			2
... " as pop philosopher @entity91 wrote in " @entity92 , " " there is an urge to say : i was here , i felt this , and it matters ! " and this sense of cosmic awe continues to manifest itself in the age of technology , as @entity100 wrote in his book " @entity102 " : " collectively , human societies can no more dodge sublime imaginings or spiritual yearnings than they can transcend the tidal pulls of @entity107			1
... " we are beset with a thirst for meaning and connection that centuries of skeptical philosophy , hardheaded materialism can not eliminate			0
... today we turn to the cosmic awe conjured by science fiction , or the outer - space snapshots of the @entity119 telescope as it calls forth our ever - deeper , ever - brighter possible selves			0
" @entity124 , in his book " @entity124 , " wrote about the origins of human language : this unique , often ecstatic expression of consciousness that bursts forth as morsels of meaning encoded as vocal patterns			0
he believes the origins of language stem from our early use of psychedelic compounds , which caused a sort of " ontological awakening " of our species and thus acted as an early catalyst for religion , cosmic feelings of awe and a desire for transcendent experiences			0
these experiences , to borrow the words of @entity147 , re-contextualize oneself as a marvelous conduit in a timeless whole , through which molecules and meaning flow , from nebulae to neurons and back again			0
early shamans , @entity100 wrote in " @entity102 , " became ecstatic technicians of the sacred			0
regardless of whether you buy @entity160 's theory , he does provide a compelling case for the relationship between " cosmic , out - of - body euphoria " and the cognitive leaps to which it can give rise			0
some of our greatest poets , scientists and other thinkers have attributed some of their greatest inspiration to the use of these psychedelic chemicals and their resulting out - of - context perspectives			0
but it 's not necessarily the chemicals themselves i 'm interested in , but rather what they do to our sense of perspective and our reference points			1
my focus is the subjective experiences they seem " to occasion			0
" @entity188 explains : " the plant genies do n't manufacture imagination , nor do they market wonder and beauty -- but they force us out of context so dramatically and so meditatively that we gawk in amazement at the ubiquitous everyday wonders that we are culturally disposed to overlook , and they teach us invaluable lessons about fluidity , relativity , flexibility and paradox			0
such an increase in awareness , if skillfully applied , can lift a disciplined , adventurous artist permanently out of reach of the faded jaws of mediocrity			0
" in my mind the key idea here is that of being forced out of context			0
we do n't necessarily require psychedelics for this , although they might offer a shortcut			0
what we require is a bold new attitude and a sense of humility that accepts the ambiguity of many of our so - called truths , habitual thought patterns and cultural reality tunnels			1
by accepting the need to constantly de-condition our thinking to approach the world with new eyes , we can reconnect with our sense of awe and wonder			1
as @entity235 wrote , " in order to see things as if for the first time , we must remember to forget			0
" @entity236 used to say " dare to be naive			0
" oftentimes , our sense of what we think we know is precisely what prevents us from approaching situations free of prejudice			2
" @entity242 is a defense against being overwhelmed , " @entity235 wrote in his book " @entity245			0
" this makes perfect sense to me : in a world where disruption is the new normal , and technological change is happening at an exponential rate ; a world where we are bombarded with media messages , and where " attention " is the new limited resource , it seems easier to recoil away from all the mindblowingness going on , and instead look for reasons to be bored			1
the mundane can be quite comforting for those terrified of leaving their comfort zone			0
and this where i think my work serves the purpose of infecting people with wonderment			2
my short videos are " digital psychedelics " meant to " de-center " the self , dwindle the broadcast of the ego and provide people with a long view , " big picture " perspective on humanity , technology and how their symbiosis might make a dent in the cosmos			1
as @entity285 wrote in " @entity286 " : " we must never forget we are cosmic revolutionaries			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity289 .			1
