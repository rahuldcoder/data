" @entity4 -- " @entity5			1
" the @entity6 are n't until february 24 -- but the latest @entity8 blockbuster and its all - star cast did n't disappoint			2
the intrigue , the subplots , the glitz and glamor of two @entity15 giants steeped in glorious history			0
the master and the apprentice ably played by @entity2 and @entity1			0
the love affair between the two , the cozy drinks and the bottles of red wine , the terrible children cast as @entity4 and @entity27			1
the best of " frenemies " is how the pair are described			0
if only @entity2 had n't admitted to leaving his finest claret on the airplane			0
enter stage left , @entity34 -- the nine - time winner of the @entity8 led by the man who once wore the red of @entity38 with such distinction			1
ronaldo fires warning to former club @entity38 ronaldo -- all $ 124 million of him -- is the man who lives a movie star existence , scoring goals for fun , 183 in 180 appearances since his move from @entity47 in 2009			1
@entity34 , the first club to ever break the $ 650.5 million revenue barrier in a single year and the most successful club side in the history of @entity15 football			1
then of course there 's @entity1 , the man constantly linked with a move to @entity47 when @entity2 eventually retires			0
suave and sophisticated with his film star looks , @entity1 's departure from @entity57 in september 2007 is still mourned to this day			0
a natural on camera , a wonderful way with words and his ability to charm , made him a favorite with the country 's football aficionados			0
with real 16 points behind @entity68 in the @entity70 league and @entity1 already stating that his next club will be in @entity57 , perhaps this duel with @entity2 could be considered an audition			1
' i hate my social life , ' says @entity1 if so , then perhaps it is the elder statesman who holds the aces			0
@entity2 has always claimed that @entity38 's three @entity15 titles are not enough for a club of its magnitude			1
whether his team will add to that collection this year remains open to question , but after securing a 1 - 1 draw at the @entity86 , @entity38 will retain lofty ambitions			1
there were goals -- ronaldo scoring against his former club -- moments of controversy , world - class saves			1
@entity4 admits @entity34 's @entity8 ' anxiety ' it was pulsating , breathless , two heavyweights of the beautiful game slugging it out at the very highest level amid one of the most dramatic settings in world football			1
a cauldron of noise and expectation greeted the players and yet , in one single movement of @entity112 's head , the @entity86 was silenced			1
@entity27 , on the periphery of the action for much of the night , sent in a corner and the young @entity57 striker rose highest to plant a header into the far corner -- only his second goal in 28 games			0
first blood to @entity38 so many had predicted @entity34 would use their attacking prowess to blow holes in a @entity38 side deprived of warrior - like defender @entity125			1
but this is @entity38 -- this is a club which knows how to fight , to survive when the odds are stacked heavily against it			1
it may not be able to match the nine @entity15 titles of @entity34 , but this is a club which has made the final in 2008 , 2009 and 2011 on top of its three successes			1
@entity34 , @entity68 or @entity38 : which is the biggest club ? @entity34 's history and appeal worldwide is well known , but @entity38 are catching up both on the pitch and off it			1
finacially , @entity38 continue to reach new audiences and according to @entity139 , senior manager in the @entity140 at @entity141 , the club is on track to overhaul the @entity70			1
" @entity38 continue to successfully leverage their global brand , " he said following the publishing of the annual @entity146 table			2
" the new world - record seven - year shirt sponsorship deal with @entity151 will double the revenues the club receives from its shirt partner in the first season of the new deal in 2014 - 15			2
" this combined with new @entity158 broadcast deals from 2013 - 14 , which will deliver incremental distributions of between £ 20 million ( $ 31.7 million ) and £ 30 million ( $ 47.5 million ) per club , will help @entity38 push the two @entity70 clubs above them , for a top two ranking			1
" while money matters , there can be no doubt that the biggest bargain was @entity34 's decision to throw piles of cash at @entity38 for @entity4			1
it was his equalizer on 30 minutes which caught the eye , his ability to hang in the air and generate an unfathomable amount of power to head the ball into the net remains a joy to behold			0
from there on it was simply wonderful to watch			0
@entity182 hit the crossbar and had another effort hacked off the line , while the much - maligned @entity186 produced an astonishing performance in the @entity38 goal , fending off every effort which came within his grasp			1
how @entity38 tried to drown the stars of @entity34 in 1957 both teams had opportunities , @entity34 might have even been reduced to 10 men had the referee not afforded @entity196 a huge let - off for his foul on @entity199 as last man			1
the sequel at @entity202 on march 5 can not come quickly enough following this latest installment in the fascinating duel between the master and his apprentice			0

this tie is not over			2
" they defended well and the result is open , " @entity1 told @entity212			0
