@entity0 , @entity1 -- a retired @entity1 general whose movement launched an assault on @entity8 militias in @entity9 and demanded the suspension of parliament has called for a new council to take over the running of the country			1

" he made his call for a new , civilian council to take its place during a televised news conference in @entity9			1
on sunday , armed men claiming allegiance to @entity30 's newly formed movement , known as the @entity31 , stormed parliament and announced they had suspended it			2
@entity15 said wednesday that since the parliament had refused to " fulfill the demands of the people , " he was asking the @entity35 to appoint a civilian council to lead the country , in the interests of political stability and security			1
this council , he said , would have three main tasks : appointing a caretaker emergency government , overseeing the upcoming parliamentary elections and handing over power to the new parliament			2
the country 's electoral commission announced that elections would be held next month , the state news agency @entity47 reported tuesday , in what seemed to be a move to try to ease tensions that drove @entity1 to the brink in recent days			1
@entity15 said his forces would secure the country during the transitional period and after that			2
the declared goal of the @entity31 is to eradicate @entity8 militants from @entity1 , including @entity60 -- the group blamed for the september 11 , 2012 deadly attack on the @entity63 consulate in @entity9			1
air force , navy chiefs back @entity15 's movement this week , @entity30 's so - called " @entity72 , " which he has described as an open - ended war on terrorism in @entity1 , seemed to gain more support from military units , officials and armed groups across the country			1

asked whether his movement was receiving support from @entity122 @entity121 or any other country , @entity15 said they were depending only on " @entity125 and the @entity1 people			2
" some see @entity15 's campaign as an opportunistic strategy capitalizing on @entity1 ' growing discontent with a weak central government and the deteriorating security situation in the country			1
@entity15 was once a general in the @entity1 army under dictator @entity134 but had a falling out with him and emigrated to the @entity63 , where he lived for almost 20 years			1
