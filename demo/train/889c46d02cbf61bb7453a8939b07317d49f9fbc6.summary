-- since the first @entity4 book came out in 1999 , trends in young adult fiction have shifted from wizards to glittering vampires , followed by bloodthirsty " @entity7 " and , now , teens coping with terminal illnesses and realistic issues			1
these trends influence which books publishers market toward teens			1
will the success of novels like @entity19 's " @entity18 " flood next year 's market with realistic contemporary plots ? it 's a question that publishers and authors tackled recently during @entity27 's online panel discussion " @entity22 or a teen : reality bites in @entity29 " they found that while writers like @entity33 and @entity19 have opened the doors for authors and stories in their respective genres , young adult fiction should never be driven in just one direction			1
the nature of trends is cyclical rather than disappearing , said @entity41 of @entity42			0
this week , @entity44 , young readers will have a chance to speak for themselves and vote for their favorite books on the @entity48 website			1
readers between the ages of 12 and 18 can nominate and vote for their favorite titles from the past year via the @entity53 ' top ten list			0
40 new titles to feed your @entity29 book addiction we spoke with a few young adult fiction experts for a trend outlook going into 2015			1
the ' @entity19 effect ' contemporary stories with heavier topics and " illness books " are on the rise , according to @entity65 , website editor of @entity66			1
" from mental illness to cancer , books are tackling issues that affect some teens every day , " she said			1
examples include @entity74 's " @entity73 , " @entity76 's " the @entity75 " and @entity78 ' " @entity77			0
" @entity79 of @entity80 in @entity29 has also found the trend in more diverse offerings , like @entity84 's " to all the @entity83 " and @entity86 's " @entity85			0
" " both had funny light moments but also real and thought - provoking scenes with wonderfully drawn characters , " @entity87 said			0
" i 've also enjoyed great thrillers like @entity94 ' ' @entity93 ' and @entity96 - winning author @entity95 's sophomore novel , ' @entity97			0
' " @entity100 shine although paranormal and dystopian titles are still being read and published , other subgenres like mystery and horror are on the rise in the wake of these popular trends , according to @entity48 president @entity108			1
" it 's nice to see a horror renaissance that is n't focused solely on zombies , " he said			1
" @entity113 is still going strong , and with the success of @entity115 's ' @entity117 ' series and the highly buzzed ' @entity118 ' by @entity119 , i 'm sure we 'll see even more fantasy novels next year , " said @entity112 , assistant web editor at @entity66			0
new adult " the big trend near this age group continues to be new adult , with much more sexy , adult story lines , " @entity65 said			1
these titles often include characters that are entering or already in college			0
books by authors like @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 have proved to be a big hit with readers , and the genre is expanding to include more than just contemporary love stories			1
love , bullying and friendship much of young adult fiction is issue - driven , telling relatable stories of how to face the everyday struggles of being a teen			1
bullying remains a popular topic , with stories like " tease " by @entity151 being told from the viewpoint of the bully herself , according to @entity65			2
in the place of complicated love triangles or predictable couples , stories about platonic friendships between quirky teens who do n't fall in love are on the rise , @entity108 said			1
" there 's also been a slight increase in novels dealing with teen sexuality , which i think -- and hope -- will carry over into 2015 and beyond , " @entity112 said			0
diversity according to the @entity172 , the number of " children of mixed race grew at a faster rate than any other group over the past decade , " increasing by 46 % from 2000 to 2010			2
the book market does n't currently match those budding readers with enough diverse offerings , @entity108 said			0
but there is a movement for change			0
@entity87 and @entity65 were both excited to see diverse titles like @entity184 's " like no other , " @entity186 's " rain , " @entity188 's " pantomime " and @entity190 's " the @entity189 " this year			0
" i 've seen real momentum in the awareness and desire for more inclusive and diverse narratives , culminating in the amazing # weneeddiversebooks @entity196 campaign that went viral , " @entity87 said			2
the " we need @entity199 " team has taken up initiatives outside of @entity196 to bring diverse books into classrooms and organize the first @entity203 for 2016 , @entity87 pointed out			2
but she also believes that traditional publishing still has a long way to go			2
" i would love to see more books dealing with mental health conditions , other disabilities and the underrepresented individuals of the @entity212 spectrum , " @entity112 said			0
" better yet , i 'd love to see books feature these topics without making them the sole focus			0
a diverse book should n't be a ' @entity218 ' ; it should just be another great novel that teens devour in hours and love for the rest of their lives			2

" @entity18 " likely to bring *uptick* in contemporary young adult fiction
mystery and horror stories are on the rise for teens
there is momentum for diversity in young adult lit but a long way to go , experts say
