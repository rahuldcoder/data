-- @entity2 's @entity1 has struck down the country 's laws about prostitution			1
while selling sex for money is n't illegal in @entity2 , until friday 's 9 - 0 ruling , three specific laws had made it difficult for prostitutes to more safely and securely engage in sex work			1
one of the laws prohibited anyone from operating a brothel			1
another forbade people from earning a living working for a prostitute , such as being a driver , bookkeeper or bodyguard			0
another law reportedly made it illegal to communicate in public about acts of prostitution			1
on friday , chief justice @entity28 said that the court 's decision would be " suspended for one year " until @entity32 amends the laws			1
@entity28 said the time should be allotted because " the regulation of prostitution is a complex and delicate matter			2
" according to the @entity41 , if 12 months from now the federal government has not redrafted legislation , then prostitutes will be allowed to legally work , hire drivers , bodyguards and accountants , and screen their clients			0
the law 's purpose " is to target pimps and the parasitic , exploitative conduct in which they engage , " the court said friday			2
" the law , however , punishes everyone who lives on the avails of prostitution without distinguishing between those who exploit prostitutes and those who could increase the safety and security of prostitutes , for example , legitimate drivers , managers , or bodyguards			2
the living on the avails provision is consequently overbroad			0
" on another matter , the law on prohibiting soliciting was designed " not to eliminate street prostitution for its own sake , but to take prostitution off the streets and out of public view in order to prevent the nuisances that street prostitution can cause , " the high court found			0
@entity0 affiliate @entity78 , citing a criminologist , said @entity32 could criminalize the sale or purchase of sex and choose to regulate where prostitution can occur			0
@entity32 also could do nothing , in which case the provinces and municipalities would likely develop their own provisions , @entity78 said .			0
