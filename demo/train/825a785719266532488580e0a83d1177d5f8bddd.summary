the @entity1 needs to overhaul its support for clean energy research to keep recent gains alive as subsidies that have fueled a boom in the field expire , researchers urged wednesday			1
federal support for clean power " will have been largely dismantled by the end of 2014 , " a new report by a trio of think tanks warns			1
more than 70 % of the programs now on the books -- many of them part of the @entity22 administration 's 2009 economic stimulus bill -- are set to expire in the next two years , the report concludes			1
" neither @entity30 ' attitude or the public purse right now is going to allow business as usual , " said @entity23 , policy director for the @entity25 's @entity24 and one of the report 's authors			2
but he said the end of programs in current law was in sight , " and it 's going to be broader and deeper than people imagine			1
it 's time to start thinking about this very seriously			0
" the report , " @entity50 , " urges @entity41 to rethink rather than eliminate its support for projects that produce power with little or none of the carbon emissions most scientists blame for an increase in global temperatures			2
it was produced by @entity25 , the @entity41 - based @entity52 and the @entity53 , a @entity55 - based center that focuses on energy and the environment			2
about two - thirds of the $ 24 billion @entity41 spent on energy subsidies in 2011 went to support energy efficiency and renewable sources such as wind , solar and biofuels			1
in addition , private investors poured another $ 48 billion into renewable energy last year , a report from the @entity66 found last week			2
that boosted the @entity1 back to the no. 1 slot worldwide after two years trailing @entity72 , @entity66 found -- a move aided by many of the subsidy programs that are scheduled to expire			1
the research and investments have led to sharply higher electric generating capacity and reduced cost to a point where renewable energy is nearly competitive with natural gas , said @entity83 , director of energy and climate policy at the @entity53			0
in some places , wind power is as cheap as electricity from gas , largely because of a federal tax credit , @entity83 said			1
but much of that success is because of subsidies aimed at helping those technologies win a foothold in the market , which is still dominated by coal			0
" we need to make sure we 're not walking away and pulling the plug on that sector right now , " @entity83 told @entity97			0
the report calls for a tripling of energy research and development funding and replacing current federal loan guarantees with programs aimed at helping private companies get low - carbon technologies to market faster			1
in addition , the current interest among military planners in projects such as solar power -- spurred partly by the wish to reduce the risks involved in shipping fuel to troops in the field -- could lead to commercial applications , the researchers state			2
the study did n't calculate a price tag for those plans			0
@entity83 said the money needed might not be as much as the peak of spending under the stimulus bill and earlier programs , which was as high as $ 44 billion in 2009 -- " but i think it needs to be quite a bit higher than the downward slope we see going forward			0
" among the republicans who control the @entity133 , however , there appears to be little support for keeping clean energy programs alive			1
in particular , the 2011 failure of the solar - panel manufacturer @entity138 became a lightning rod for critics of the @entity22 administration			2
supporters say @entity138 was undermined by the explosive growth of the solar industry in @entity72 , but the @entity145 has attacked the loan - guarantee program as a boondoggle that rewards politically favored industries			1
" what 's going on in the @entity155 is unbelievable , " @entity150 rep. @entity149 , the chairman of a @entity133 subcommittee that oversees stimulus spending , told reporters tuesday			0
" this loan guarantee program -- 27 companies got your tax dollars			0
twenty - three of those companies had ratings of double - b - minus from @entity163 and @entity164 's , which is another way of saying they were junk rated			0
no private money would go there			0
" @entity138 's failure " certainly crystallized a lot of concerns , " @entity23 said			0
" it exacerbated a kind of backlash that has made all of this more difficult , and it has complicated the ability to have clear pragmatic discussions about how to support these industries and continue driving them towards subsidy independence			0
" @entity138 received more than $ 500 million in loan guarantees from the @entity155 before filing for bankruptcy , putting 1,000 - plus workers out of their jobs			0
another @entity155 - funded company , @entity187 - based @entity186 , announced tuesday that it would lay off 2,000 people -- most of them in @entity189 , where the solar market has weakened in recent months , the company said			1
@entity83 said the current boom in natural gas is being driven by drilling techniques that were largely the result of federally funded research and technology since the 1970s			1
however , that " sort of moved the bar on wind and solar , " sharply dropping natural gas prices just as those technologies were becoming more competitive .			2

@entity1 clean energy subsidies will be " largely dismantled " by 2014 , report finds
the effect will be " broader and deeper than people imagine , " one of its authors says
the programs have fueled a boom in solar and wind power
