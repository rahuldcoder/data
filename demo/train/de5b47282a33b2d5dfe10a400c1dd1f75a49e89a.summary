@entity0 -- secretary of state @entity2 tuesday ditched " quiet diplomacy " and spoke publicly in support of @entity5 women protesting the unwritten ban on their right to drive in the kingdom			1
" what these women are doing is brave and what they are seeking is right " said @entity10 , in answer to a question from @entity1 at a press availability at the @entity14			1
" this is about @entity5 women themselves , they have joined together			1
they are acting on behalf of their own rights			0
" until now , the @entity14 said @entity10 was engaged in " quiet diplomacy , " working behind the scenes and raising the issue last week in a telephone conversation with @entity5 prince @entity27			1
on monday , @entity14 spokeswoman @entity28 told reporters , " there are times when it makes sense to do so publicly and there are times for quiet diplomacy			1
" but @entity5 women for driving , which describes itself as a coalition of women 's rights activist , bloggers and academics campaigning for the right to drive , told the secretary of state they were " disappointed " by her public silence			1
@entity10 has made women 's rights a top issue for @entity49 diplomacy			2
" @entity52 diplomacy is not what we need right now , " the group said in a letter			0
" what we need is for you , personally , to make a strong , simple and public statement supporting our right to drive			0
" the movement was sparked by the may 22 arrest of a @entity5 technology consultant and mother named @entity62 who was detained for driving her own car			2
supporters started a campaign on the @entity66 and collected , they say , 100,000 signatures from 156 countries calling for @entity69 to be released and acquitted of all charges			0
on friday , some @entity5 women turned the key in the ignition and set out on a motorized protest			1
@entity10 's public silence had raised questions that she might be sidestepping the controversy to avoid angering the @entity5 government at a time when the @entity49 needs help on @entity83 issues			2
the @entity49 has avoided criticizing @entity5 amidst the @entity85 uprisings in other @entity83 and @entity87 nations			0
on tuesday , however , @entity10 shot that down , saying , " this is about @entity5 women themselves , they have joined together , they are acting on behalf of their own rights			1
" " this is not about the @entity49 , it 's not about what any of us on the outside say , it is about the women themselves and their right to raise their concerns with their own government			0
" " we have made clear our views that women everywhere , including women in the kingdom , have the right to make decisions about their lives and their futures , " @entity10 said			2
" they have the right to contribute to society and provide for their children and their families			0
" the right to drive , she said , provides access to economic opportunity , including jobs .			0
