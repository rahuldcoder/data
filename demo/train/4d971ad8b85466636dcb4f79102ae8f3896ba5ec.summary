@entity0 -- pop star @entity2 will headline a rally in @entity4 , @entity5 , on monday calling on the state 's two @entity7 senators to vote yes on taking up a defense bill that includes authorization to repeal the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy toward gay and lesbian servicemembers			1
a crucial @entity17 vote is scheduled for tuesday afternoon , and supporters of the repeal say that as of now , they do not have the 60 votes needed to overcome a @entity7 filibuster blocking the bill			1
@entity5 republicans @entity23 and @entity25 are publicly undecided , and could each potentially provide @entity26 the votes they need to bring the issue before the @entity17			1

@entity7 leaders are trying to keep all 41 @entity7 senators on board to block the bill , arguing that senate majority leader @entity63 , @entity64 , is unfairly limiting the amendments allowed to try to change the bill once it is on the @entity17 floor			1
@entity7 leaders are also ridiculing @entity63 for trying to bring what they call a purely political vote to the @entity17 floor right before the election , to appease the gay community , which has been frustrated with @entity26 for inaction on this issue			0
