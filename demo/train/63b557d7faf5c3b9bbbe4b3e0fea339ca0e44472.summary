" on december 24th an unauthorized party disclosed personally identifiable information and related credit card data of some of our members , " it said			1
" we have reason to believe that your personal and credit card data could have been included in the information that was illegally obtained and disclosed			1
" @entity42 of @entity43 , @entity44 , told @entity0 he was victimized by the misuse of his private information that was hacked from the website before it was posted on websites on the 24th			1

@entity1 said the claim that the data included the firm 's " private clients " was wrong			2

" hackers claiming to be @entity7 have distorted this truth in order to further their hidden agenda , and some @entity114 have taken the bait			1
" " the leaked client list represents subscribers to a daily publication which is the primary service of @entity1 , " it continued			1
" @entity1 analysts are widely considered to be extremely unbiased			2
@entity7 does not attack media sources			2
" @entity1 's @entity76 said the company is working closely with law enforcement			1
" @entity1 's relationship with its members and , in particular , the confidentiality of their subscriber information , are very important to @entity1 and me , " he wrote on the firm 's @entity125 page			1
" we have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other web sites , " the @entity43 , @entity44 , company said			1
" we are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained			0
" asked about the hacking , @entity140 spokesman @entity139 said sunday that " initial indications suggest that there has been no impact " to the @entity140 grid			0
