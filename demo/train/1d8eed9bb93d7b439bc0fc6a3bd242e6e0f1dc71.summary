@entity0 -- justice @entity2 is approaching his 40th year on the federal bench -- the last 34 on the @entity4 , deciding thousands of cases			1
but he said his love of the law was nurtured decades earlier by a professor 's dedication and the enduring power of a political dispute that blossomed into a landmark decision known as @entity13			2
justice @entity2 swears in vice president @entity14			1
@entity2 has been on the court for 34 years			1
" it was the beginning , well , of my whole legal career , " @entity2 told @entity1 in a recent exclusive interview			1
" you read it today and you will find some current value in it			0
for me , that case inspired a lasting appreciation and respect for the rule of law			1
" the 88 - year - old justice , who sources said has no plans to step down anytime soon , is not alone in citing the 1803 high court ruling as a cornerstone of federal court authority			1
the landmark decision for the first time established the power of the @entity4 to declare acts of @entity38 unconstitutional			2
it also helped codify the idea of separation of powers as a lasting hallmark of the @entity45 system of government			2
the case is the subject of a new book , " the great decision : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54 for the @entity4 " ( @entity55 ) , which includes @entity2 ' analysis of the opinion 's impact over the years			1
written by @entity60 -- a former @entity2 law clerk -- and @entity62 , it offers an inside look at how the federal judiciary , led by chief justice @entity53 , muscled itself into equal footing with the other two branches of government			1
it is a struggle , @entity60 noted , that continues to affect issues today , such as the president 's authority in the war on terror , federal bans on late - term abortion and church - state disputes			2
" there is a view of an enduring role for our courts that rises above the political pressures and cross-currents of the moment , " said @entity60			0
" there are imperfections , there are problems , but it 's been the most protective regime for rights and liberties of any country in the world			2
and it 's really attributable to the special role of the [ @entity4 ] @entity4 in safeguarding our rights and liberties that @entity100 established			1
" immersed from the start in @entity100 v. @entity102 @entity2 still has his law school notes from @entity104 , which he entered in 1945			1
it was just months after leaving the @entity106 , where he served as an intelligence officer during @entity108 at the time , he was thinking of becoming an @entity110 teacher , but @entity2 said his brother @entity111 asked him to think about a law career			1
" at the time i was trying to decide what to do , and it seemed like a sensible move , " @entity2 said , with his characteristic @entity114 modesty			2
it was as a freshman that he met his early mentor , @entity121 , who immersed his students in @entity13 from the start			0
" i knew nothing about it before i went to law school , but it was a major part of our constitutional law course , " @entity2 recalled			1
" we began with the case and we were still on it six or eight weeks later			2
we spent most of the first semester studying that one case , and the different issues that come out of it			2
" something must have stuck , because when he graduated two years later , @entity2 had the highest gpa in the history of the law school			2
the justice gives credit for much of his budding success to @entity121 , a former @entity104 dean and faculty member for 47 years			0
" he was very brilliant , he could ask good questions and get people to think about issues , " said @entity2			2
" he was a very decent and inspiring teacher			0
" from political pot - boiler to legal treatise one thing @entity2 admires about @entity13 is " there are a whole bunch of issues that are discussed in it			1
when is executive privilege something that the president can rely on ; when should there be a remedy for a wrong ? " it was a big case that had humble beginnings			0
the behind - the - scenes intrigue reads more like a political pot - boiler than a legal treatise			0
the fight began in early 1801 , in the closing days of the @entity165 administration of president @entity52 -- who had just lost the election to @entity51 , who was poised to take over the @entity168			0
@entity60 noted , " @entity52 was packing the federal government , the @entity0 government , and the federal courts with midnight appointees			0
one of these was @entity100			0
" the @entity174 financier was set to be justice of the peace of @entity0 , but somehow his commission was not delivered in time , in person by the @entity179 , as the law required			0
so when @entity51 -- a @entity181 -- took over , he canceled all pending appointments , leaving @entity100 and other @entity165 in the outs , and enraged			0
@entity100 sued the @entity184 to get his job back			0
the " @entity102 " in this case was none other than @entity188 -- principal author of the @entity190 , and then @entity51 's secretary of state			1
@entity53 played two roles as a backdrop , " @entity201 " details fascinating tales of the capital at the turn of the 19th century , including " the dust and grime of @entity0 " -- not much different from our own , except perhaps for the grime			0
among the tales : a senator 's " romantic interest " -- as @entity2 put it -- in @entity209 , wife of the future president ; and @entity53 's own physical prowess -- he reportedly could jump 6 feet and had a taste for fine whiskey			1
it was that man 's failure as a bureaucrat and genius as a judge that led to the 4 - 0 decision			2
in february 1801 , native @entity219 -- an @entity52 ally -- was serving as both secretary of state and the newly named chief justice of the @entity45			0
" he was the one who bungled the delivery of the commissions , " said @entity60 , " so he was deeply involved in the underlying facts of the case			0
the genius of @entity53 was that he got out of a very difficult jam by finding @entity100 's appeal to have merit , but his direct appeal to the @entity4 to be unconstitutional			1
" such direct appeals were allowed under federal law , but the high court ruled the law went too far by attempting to give one branch of government a power specifically denied it by the @entity190			1
the decision thus set precedents for both separation of powers and constitutional interpretation -- the court 's right to declare a law unconstitutional			1
in @entity53 's famous words , " it is emphatically the province and duty of the @entity251 " -- the courts , he means -- " to say what the law is			0
" it put the case on sacred constitutional ground in the eyes of many subsequent justices			0
it was cited in @entity261 , and the 1974 order for president @entity263 to turn over secret @entity168 tapes during the @entity265			0
@entity2 emphasizes separation of power @entity60 said his old boss in particular has a fondness for the stirring words of @entity100			1
" it 's not surprising that when justices like @entity2 are grappling with the very difficult questions that come before them and the deeply contested constitutional issues that they turn to that guiding star of the first principle of @entity13 , and get inspiration and strength from it			1
" it was separation of powers @entity2 chose to emphasize as a principal hallmark of @entity100			1
during a panel discussion a few weeks ago , he noted the wall between the courts and the executive can be breached			0
as an example , he cited public swear - ins of justices that have lately been held at the @entity168			0
@entity2 said it is far preferable they be conducted at the @entity4 itself -- such as his 1975 ceremony -- to underscore the " very separate status " of the justices			1
he later said the power he and his fellow benchmates enjoy today is embedded in that principle : " @entity13 established that idea of separation , something no other branch of government -- no political majority -- can take away from the judiciary			0
