-- interim @entity2 president @entity1 installed himself as leader of a new unity government late thursday , a move that drew condemnation from ousted president @entity8			1
making a late night public announcement , @entity1 said his entire cabinet had resigned to clear the way for a reconciliation cabinet to be named			0
" this cabinet is a result of an ample participation of different sectors of civil society as well as the political parties , " he said			0
" tonight with this new government , we 're answering the call for the unity of all people of @entity2			1
" he did not identify any of the new cabinet members			0
representatives for @entity1 and @entity8 signed an agreement october 30 to form a reconciliation government that would rule until a new president , to be chosen in a november 29 election , takes office in january			1
the deal included the possibility of @entity8 's reinstatement to the presidency , but contained no guarantee			1
the pact called for the unity government to be named by thursday			2
the agreement also stipulated that the nation 's congress , in consultation with the supreme court and other institutions , would vote on whether @entity8 would be returned to power			0
that vote did not occur thursday			0
@entity8 told local media that @entity1 's actions violated the accord , which he called " a dead letter			1
" the reconciliation government , he said , must be led by the democratically elected president of @entity2			2
" how can a person who has not been elected by anyone lead a government ? " he said			0
@entity8 was flown out of the country by the country 's military june 28 but secretly returned to @entity2 on september 21 , obtaining refuge in the @entity60 embassy			1
@entity1 sent @entity8 a letter earlier this week asking him for the names of people the deposed president would like to have in the unity government			1
@entity8 did not answer the letter			0
@entity1 said @entity8 's refusal to answer gave the interim president the right to name all the members of a new government			1
" with this agreement , we have made an important step to strengthen our democracy , " @entity1 said			0
" despite the fact that mister @entity8 did not send any of his representatives ... we 're still looking for an opportunity for these citizens of @entity2 to be integrated in the government of reconciliation			1
" the @entity81 , the @entity82 , the @entity83 and the @entity84 condemned the coup and demanded that @entity8 be reinstated			0

many nations , including the @entity84 , also said they would not recognize the winner of this month 's presidential election if the vote is held under @entity1 's rule			0
the @entity84 seemed to shift that position after last week 's accord			1
@entity96 , assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs , told @entity97 this week that the @entity84 would recognize the winner of this month 's presidential election even if @entity8 is not returned to power beforehand			2
@entity96 played a key role in obtaining last week 's agreement			2
the political crisis stemmed from @entity8 's desire to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president			2
the country 's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal			0
@entity1 and his supporters say @entity8 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup .			1
