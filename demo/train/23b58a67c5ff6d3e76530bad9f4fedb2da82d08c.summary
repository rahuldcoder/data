@entity0 , @entity1 -- it happened during my taxi ride from the airport to the hotel			1
after giving me a quick look , the cab driver asked : " so where can i take you , @entity12 ? " i had just arrived in @entity13 , @entity1 located in the state of @entity15 , which has the highest percentage of @entity17 in @entity1			1
yes , i was wearing a dark suit -- my blue shirt had no collar though -- but the confusion had to do more with the cab driver 's sense of anticipation than the way i looked			0
more than 3,000 archbishops , bishops , priests and nuns descended on @entity15 last week with the hope of meeting the head of the @entity17			0
pope @entity32 was coming to @entity1 for the very first time in his seven - year papacy and the sense of anticipation was great			1
it was to be the pope 's first trip to @entity41 - speaking @entity40 as well			2
the country was chosen carefully : @entity1 has the second largest population of @entity17 in the world , after @entity45			1
by the time @entity32 arrived at @entity46 friday afternoon , there were tens of thousands of people lining up the streets along the 20 - mile stretch that would take him to @entity52 , a catholic school run by nuns in the city of @entity0 where the pope would stay three nights			2
most greeters were high school students who seemed genuinely excited about the pope 's arrival			0
but others were compelled to attend by schools and church authorities			0
the @entity65 of @entity0 cancelled classes and declared a holiday			0
@entity1 was the first country @entity68 visited in 1979 , only months after being elevated to the papacy			2
@entity32 has been pope for seven years and had received two personal invitations from @entity1 president @entity71 , who traveled to the @entity72 in 2007 and again in may of last year			1
before the visit , many @entity1 @entity17 perceived @entity32 as a distant and reserved pope who felt uneasy when interacting with people -- a perception the @entity17 and the @entity77 were trying to lay to rest			1
that probably explains the reason why @entity32 wore a broad - brimmed sombrero on arriving at @entity15 's @entity82 to celebrate a mass attended by hundreds of thousands			2
he again wore a sombrero when addressing worshippers congregated outside @entity52 on the last night of his visit			0
" i 've made a lot of trips , but i 've never been welcomed with such enthusiasm			0
now i can understand why @entity68 used to say ' i feel like i 'm a @entity1 pope ' , " @entity32 told a crowd of thousands of excited followers			1
and then , there were the references to the @entity94 , the patron saint of @entity1			0
as an academic with deep knowledge of theology and canon law , the pope is probably not thrilled about the fact that some @entity1 put images of the dark - skinned representation of the @entity104 right next to that of @entity106			1
" to love her [ the @entity104 ] is to get committed to listen to her son ; to venerate the @entity94 is to live according to the words of the blessed fruit of her womb , " the pope reminded people attending the open - air @entity109 at the @entity118 , the pontiff urged @entity1 to rely on their faith to fight poverty , drug violence and other ills that have afflicted @entity1 in recent years			1
the pope made repeated references to the sorrow of recent violence in @entity1			2
@entity1 is only three months away from holding presidential elections and the opposition questioned the timing of the visit			1
president @entity71 's party , the @entity132 , is @entity17 - oriented and deeply conservative			2
the president appeared with the pope every single day of this visit			0
that would have been unthinkable before 1992 , when @entity1 resumed diplomatic relations with the @entity138 after a 130 - year freeze			0
all four presidential candidates attended the pope 's main mass at the park			2
the only controversy about the visit surfaced saturday			0
on the same day pope @entity32 addressed and blessed a group of 1,800 children in @entity15 , three @entity1 authors released a book accusing the @entity138 of hiding or ignoring cases of child sex abuse by @entity17 priests			1
the book entitled " @entity155 de no @entity156 " ( willing not to be aware ) , focuses on father @entity157 , a now - deceased , @entity1 - born roman catholic priest accused of multiple cases of sexual abuse of minors			0
calls for the pope to meet victims of sexual abuse while in @entity1 went unanswered			0
the big question after the visit is whether pope @entity32 was able to connect with young people			1
the @entity17 has lost a significant number of members in the last few decades			0
the percentage of @entity17 now stands at 83 % in a country that used to be almost universally catholic			1
was pope @entity32 able to erase the perception that he is a distant academic or is he now seen as a warm and affectionate , grandfather - like figure , much like his predecessor ? only time will tell .			1

pope @entity32 's trip to @entity1 first since becoming pope seven years *ago*
once near universal , @entity17 population in @entity1 now stands at 83 %
@entity181 comes only three months away from @entity1 's presidential election
pope @entity32 fighting image in @entity1 of being academic and aloof
