@entity1 victories nationwide in this tuesday 's midterm elections gave the @entity1 's possible presidential hopefuls a surge of momentum tuesday night as they enter a period of serious consideration of their own @entity9 bids			1
@entity10 @entity1 sen. @entity1 , who plans to huddle with close aides in @entity12 next week to discuss his political future , seized the moment first by claiming the election result were not just a repudiation of president @entity17 , but to @entity18 — the likely @entity19 presidential nominee -- as well			1
" @entity18 was very active in @entity10 , " @entity1 told @entity21 's @entity20 at an event for sen. @entity23 , referring to @entity25 's multiple stops in the @entity10 for @entity19 challenger , @entity26			1
" the interesting thing is , ms. @entity26 decided she was going to run as a @entity25 @entity28 , " he continued			0
" well i think we soundly rejected that in @entity10 , also in @entity31			0
" ( sen. @entity32 , a @entity28 with close ties to the @entity34 , was defeated in @entity31 tuesday night by @entity1 @entity35			1
) @entity1 has been hounding @entity25 and her record as secretary of state for much of the past year			1
but with the midterms mostly over now , his attacks will carry more weight with 2016 now squarely in the political spotlight			2
in @entity1 's speech introducing @entity44 earlier in the night , he also repeated an attack line he 's been saying about @entity25 , hitting her on her recent comment about businesses not creating jobs			1
" we say to @entity18 : yes , businesses do create jobs , " he said			2
@entity1 lamented that it will be " two long years until we get to replace this president			2
" but he warned — in a not - so - subtle way — that if the president vetoes @entity1 bills , " then in 2016 the people will rise up and reclaim our heritage and elect a lover of liberty who will restore the values of our founding fathers			1
" when @entity1 spoke at @entity44 's election night party in @entity65 , his official @entity63 account even reposted a message from a follower about how supporters shouted to him to run for president			1
the errant — but revealing -- tweet was deleted three seconds later			0
while @entity1 was by far the most brazen about tying the election to @entity25 , others expressed optimism about the party 's future — and their place in it			1
in @entity80 , sen. @entity78 , another @entity1 facing similar calls to run in 2016 , used the @entity1 victory to solidify his place as an uncompromising conservative who appeals to the party base by calling for more votes to repeal the president 's health care law			1
in effort to set himself apart in a way that could promise more trouble ahead between him and other @entity1 , @entity78 even refused to say if he would support @entity44 as @entity95			2
" that will be a decision for the conference to make , " @entity78 told @entity21 's @entity96			0
@entity78 declined to answer further questions about whether he would vote to support @entity44 or not			0
former @entity102 gov. @entity101 , who also spent @entity103 in @entity80 , expressed a completely different message about the aftermath of the evening 's results			0
@entity101 emphasized governing — which would require republicans to work with @entity19 , given that the party wo n't have a filibuster - proof majority in the @entity111 and @entity17 's continued presence in the @entity9			0
" republicans in @entity114 now have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to demonstrate to @entity118 voters that our party can effectively govern , " @entity101 said in a statement			0
" that requires pursuing and passing a serious growth agenda for our nation that expands opportunity for all @entity118			0
" @entity127 @entity126 gov. @entity126 , the head of the @entity128 who barnstormed states in the weekend before election day , delivered statements of congratulations for the @entity1 governors who won tuesday night			1
democrats , meanwhile , remained mostly silent tuesday night in the face of a wave of party losses			0
former secretary of state @entity18 , vice president @entity139 and outgoing @entity141 gov. @entity140 , all democrats considering @entity9 runs , did not release statements on @entity103			2
regardless , these possible @entity9 contenders spent the past several months campaigning and fundraising for candidates across the country , an investment that will help encourage those they helped to support them if they choose to run next year			2
( @entity25 , for example , spoke at 45 events for @entity19 , and @entity126 visited 15 states for @entity1 in just the past five days			1
others kept similarly ambitious schedules			0
) while those trips could be portrayed before the elections as merely providing a helping hand for a tough mid-term battle , they set the foundation for the next two years and the race for the @entity9			0
