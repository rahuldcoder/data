@entity0 -- first it was the start of winter vacation			0
then @entity4 and @entity5 passed , as had @entity7 's eighth birthday			0
but finally -- after 10 days away from home , with his mother and the rest of their family unaware of where they were most of that time -- @entity7 and his older brother , @entity16 , should soon be heading back to @entity17			2
the two boys were found saturday evening in @entity19 , @entity20 -- about 950 miles west of their hometown of @entity22 , an @entity0 suburb -- @entity24 lt. @entity23 told @entity1			1

" i 'm ecstatic , i 'm in shock , " @entity36 , soon after hearing the news and getting off the phone with her boys			2
her joy was a far cry from what she was feeling a few hours earlier			0
@entity44 said she did n't know why her estranged husband did not bring the boys home as planned wednesday from a trip to @entity48 that began december 19			1
she told @entity1 affiliate @entity49 that she had not heard from @entity26 since december 22			1
in an emotional plea on @entity1 saturday , she asked for the boys to be brought home safely			1
" he 's trying to take care of them , " she said of her estranged husband			0
" but i think it 's a scary situation for everybody at this point			0
" police first issued an @entity60 for the suspect and his two sons on thursday , eight days after they were last seen in @entity17			1

still , they did n't know exactly where they were			2
that changed saturday , soon after @entity36 went on @entity1 , clutching @entity16 's beloved teddy bear and @entity7 's stuffed hippo as she sat beside a picture of the two boys			1
" this vacation has been overdue			0
it 's time to come home , and we welcome you home ... safely , " she said , addressing @entity26			1
" your whole family is behind this , as is my whole family			0
we are working together , and we really want you to come home			0
" a person at the @entity96 hotel in @entity20 had been watching @entity1 , recognized the @entity7 brothers and called 911 , said @entity19 police lt. @entity98			1
after getting that tip around 5:11 p.m. ct , officers went to the hotel and , as " they started setting up , saw the suspect coming out of one of the rooms with the two children , " @entity98 said			0
" he was taken into custody without further incident , " said the police spokesman , noting @entity26 is now at the @entity108			1
authorities looking into the case subsequently found " a handgun -- a pistol -- and a large sum of money			0
" @entity98 said he did n't know why the boys and their father ended up in @entity19 , or how long they 'd been there			1
but he said the case might not have been solved saturday night without the alert citizen , as well as the @entity60 system that publicizes news of missing and endangered children on highways , in police stations and around the @entity126			1
" the law enforcement community nationwide , we take these @entity129 seriously when it deals with kids , " @entity98 said			0
" this was one of the cases where it was activated and it worked			0
" around the time her estranged husband was being taken into custody , @entity44 said she got a call from a man who said , " i 'm sitting here with your two sons			2
" he then handed the phone to the boys			2
unaware of the commotion , the boys said @entity26 had told them their mother was in the hospital , @entity44 said			1
they talked about other things as well -- like the birthday boy @entity7 bragging about how he 'd been kicking @entity16 's butt on @entity154 games , and @entity44 telling them she 'd gotten the brothers an @entity158 for @entity5			0
" they were all joy , " she said			0
for now , her boys are healthy and with police , " doing what kids should be doing right now -- they 're playing , " said @entity98			1
@entity44 said saturday night that she was flying first thing to @entity169 , then renting a car and driving to @entity19			2
she does n't know where or when she 'll pick her sons up , " but we have plenty of time to figure it out			1
" she thanked the media for showcasing her family 's story , and was taken aback by how much things changed for her and her family in a moment 's notice			0
" it is amazing , " @entity44 said			2
" i had lost hope			1
" @entity1 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			2
