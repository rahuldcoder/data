the @entity0 is sending its " tankbusters " back to @entity2			1
the service 's @entity4 said this week that 12 @entity6 would be deployed to @entity7 , @entity8 , as part of @entity10 , which was formed after @entity12 's intervention in @entity13 over the past year			0
" the @entity0 is increasing rotational presence in @entity2 to reassure our allies and partner nations that our commitment to @entity20 security is a priority , " lt. gen. @entity22 , vice commander , @entity23 -- @entity24 , said in a statement			1
the @entity0 said besides operating in @entity8 , the @entity26 will be forward deployed to other partner nations in @entity2			1
@entity29 forces have operated out of bases in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , among others , in the past year			0
the a- 10 , also known as the " @entity37 , " was designed in the 1970s to support ground troops in @entity2 against the tanks and armored vehicles of the then - @entity41			1
though the jets can carry a variety of bombs and missiles , they are best known for their nose - mounted , seven - barrel 30 mm gatling gun that can fire almost 4,000 rounds per minute , enough to quickly blow apart a tank			0
the planes are also durable , with the pilot protected from ground fire by a wrapping of titanium often called " the bathtub			2
" and they are designed for easy maintenance in battlefield areas , with interchangeable parts for the right and left sides of the aircraft			2
those capabilities have been battle - proven in @entity63 , @entity64 and the @entity65			0
late last year , @entity26 were deployed in support of @entity67 , the @entity29 military campaign against @entity69 in @entity63 and @entity70			0
air force secretary @entity71 said in january that the @entity26 had flown 11 % of the @entity0 's missions against @entity69 despite coming into the conflict more than two months after initial @entity29 involvement			2
despite its current usefulness , the a- 10 is on the @entity78 's chopping block , with the @entity0 wanting to turn over the jet 's ground support mission to its newest fighter , the @entity82			1
critics of the move say the @entity6 can do better than the @entity82 because it can get lower and slower , allowing pilots to get real eyes on targets			0
and they say it is way cheaper than the @entity82 , with a flight hour for the a- 10 costing roughly half of what it costs to operate the @entity82 , according to numerous reports			0
the @entity0 says it just does n't have the money to support the a- 10 , which will be more than 40 years old at its planned retirement in 2019 , and its newest , more advanced aircraft			1
" it 's not about not liking or not wanting the a- 10			0
it 's about some very tough decisions that we have to make to recapitalize an @entity0 for the threat 10 years from now , " gen. @entity99 , the @entity0 chief of staff , said in january			2
the dozen a- 10s , along with 300 personnel from @entity104 in @entity105 , are expected to be in @entity8 by the end of february , the @entity0 said			1
the deployment is expected to last about six months			0
a- 10s have not been deployed to @entity2 since may 2013 , when 21 a- 10s that were stationed at @entity7 were removed , according to a report from @entity112 .			1

a- 10s are going to @entity2 for the first time since may 2013
the planes were designed to combat @entity41 armor during the @entity119
a- 10s may fall victim to @entity0 *budget* *restraints*
