-- it may have cost a reported $ 134 million to bring @entity2 to @entity3 , but on wednesday he scored a priceless goal as @entity5 beat archrivals @entity6 2 - 1 to win the @entity7			1
the @entity8 , who was signed from @entity9 in september 2013 , produced a stunning solo strike to give @entity5 their first trophy under @entity13 coach @entity12			2
@entity5 's triumph condemned @entity6 to three successive defeats for the first time since january 2003 and crushed the @entity19 team 's final realistic chance of winning silverware this season			1
it capped off a miserable seven days for @entity23 's @entity6 , who were last week knocked out of the @entity25 by @entity26 before losing at @entity27 in @entity28 on sunday			2
while @entity5 's big - money recruit flourished , @entity6 's star signing floundered			1
@entity31 arrived at the @entity32 amid much fanfare last june , but the @entity34 spurned a glorious opportunity to level the match in the final moments when he fired a close - range effort against the post			0
the first goal of a tense contest at @entity43 's @entity42 arrived on 11 minutes after a rapid @entity5 counter attack			2
@entity2 set @entity45 racing free and the @entity46 composed himself before firing a low shot through goalkeeper @entity48 and into the corner of the net			1
@entity48 's attempts to save the shot had @entity6 fans pining for @entity54 , the team 's longstanding goalkeeper who is unavailable after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last month			2
@entity5 had injury problems of their own with @entity59 winner @entity58 missing through a hamstring injury , although his absence was barely felt as @entity5 dominated the first half			2
@entity6 struggled to match their vibrant opponents , with @entity64 cutting a particularly forlorn figure			0
it looked as if @entity2 had doubled @entity5 's lead midway through the second period , but the winger saw his close - range header chalked off			1
moments later , @entity6 found an equalizer from the unlikeliest of sources			0
@entity76 defender @entity75 chose the perfect time to score a rare goal as he powered a firm header beyond @entity80 from @entity82 's 68th - minute corner			1
but @entity5 , and @entity2 , were not to be denied			1
with 85 minutes on the clock and extra-time looming large , @entity2 unleashed a punishing burst of pace to surge past @entity75 near the halfway line			1
@entity2 soared towards goal and , under pressure from the pursuing @entity75 , coolly poked a shot under the advancing @entity48			1
@entity6 should have leveled in the 90th minute , but @entity31 could only find the post when presented with a clear sight of goal			1
while @entity23 's men must now contemplate a somber end to the season , @entity5 have it all to play for			0
@entity12 's team face @entity98 in the @entity25 semifinals , while they also sit just three points behind city rivals @entity26 at the top of the @entity28 table			0
@entity103 struggle meanwhile in @entity105 , @entity103 lost ground in the @entity108 title race after a 2 - 2 draw against bottom club @entity110			2
@entity112 midfielder @entity111 got @entity103 off to the perfect start with a goal inside the opening two minutes , but @entity110 hit back in the second half with two goals from young @entity105 striker @entity118			0
@entity110 looked to set to grab a much - needed three points , but @entity103 found a last - gasp leveler when goalkeeper @entity121 fumbled @entity122 's tame shot into the net with two minutes remaining			0
the draws leaves @entity103 third in the @entity108 table and hands the initiative to second - place @entity127 and leaders @entity129 in the battle for the championship			0
both @entity127 and @entity129 know that they will be crowned champions if they win each of their remaining four games , with the two set to meet in what is shaping up to be a title decider on april 27			0
@entity137 suffered a setback in the battle for the fourth and final @entity25 qualification spot after losing 3 - 2 at home to @entity141			0
goals from @entity143 and @entity144 gave @entity141 a 2 - 0 lead before substitute @entity146 pulled a goal back for the hosts in the second half			1
striker @entity149 restored @entity141 's two - goal lead , with the @entity152 club resisting an onslaught in the final moments after @entity155 pulled a goal back for @entity137			0
