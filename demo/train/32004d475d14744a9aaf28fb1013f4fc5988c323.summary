-- @entity1 claims that when he heard noises in his home , he mistook girlfriend @entity4 for an intruder and accidentally shot her with his 9 mm pistol			1
plausible ? the courts will decide			0
in the meantime , the killing has highlighted @entity11 's history of gun violence and high crime			1
and it 's shown the world that many @entity11 live with a palpable , almost paranoid , fear of having their homes broken into			1
in 2012 , more than 50 % of @entity11 told the country 's police force that they 're afraid			1
the number of home burglaries across the country of 50 million have more than doubled			1
they totaled 9,063 in a 12 - month period spanning 2002/2003 ; seven years later , it was up 18,786			0
and in a similar period ending in 2012 , reported break - ins dipped to 16,766 , according to @entity11 's crime reporting body , the @entity30			1
the international group @entity31 reports that there are about 6 million licensed firearms in @entity11			1
" the paranoia about being a victim of a house robbery is understandable , " said the group 's small arms researcher @entity34			0
" victims are relatively helpless against these attacks			0

hiring a private security firm is not the exception but the norm			0
@entity51 people install panic buttons , closed - circuit televisions , man trap doors , boom gates and outdoor point - to - point infrared motion - sensing beams on their houses			0
also unique to @entity11 : when burglars break in , they likely are n't after a flat - screen television or jewelry , experts say			1
they want the homeowner 's guns			0
that 's in part because it 's very hard to acquire a gun legally in @entity11 , but it remains , many say , relatively easy to get a gun illegally			1
a history of violence to understand @entity11 's gun culture , it 's crucial to go back nearly two decades			1
in 1994 , apartheid ended			0
the official system of racial segregation , in place since 1948 , took rights away from black @entity80 and gave virtually all power in every aspect of life to whites			0
for generations , violence born out of apartheid spawned a kind of arms race ; blacks and whites fought against each other , and everyone else armed themselves , afraid to be caught in the cross fire			2

other spiritual leaders around the country began campaigning to reduce violence			1
" before 1994 , there was a low - key civil war in @entity11 , " said @entity107 , a spokesperson for @entity108 , a non-profit group that grew out of a movement to cut down on crime born from years of inequity during apartheid			1
" both sides -- white and blacks -- were armed soldiers in a way			0
" read more : @entity11 's legal system in the spotlight the roots of gun culture in @entity11 are not unlike those of the @entity127 , she said			1
" there is a history of colonization , of taking , of settling , " she said			0
" for black people , the @entity132 was a symbol of liberation , of fighting back			0
there is huge meaning attached			0
@entity138 are about fighting and superiority			0
" unlike the @entity127 , the right to own a gun is not written in the country 's constitution			1
police have confiscated and destroyed hundreds of thousands of unlicensed guns , but it 's unclear how many illegal guns remain on the street			2
researcher @entity34 also believes that criminal violence is rooted in @entity11 's historical traumas			1
there was rampant proliferation of firearms in the nation before the end of apartheid , and liberation movements stockpiled them			0
many of those weapons , she said , were never recovered			0
laying down the guns as @entity165 , @entity11 's first black president , took office in 1994 , there was a tremendous desire to put the guns down			1
" there was a national feeling that we had lived under the gun for so many years during apartheid , and we had to do something to signal that beginning anew was possible , " said @entity107 , the non-profit 's spokesperson			2
@entity107 was personally motivated to act			0
at the time , one of her closest friends was shot to death during a break - in			0
in 2000 , @entity11 passed the @entity181			1
since then , violence by handguns , @entity107 said , has dropped steadily , often by double digits			2
among the law 's rigors : before it was enacted , 16 was the minimum age to own a gun ; today it 's 21			2
to apply for a gun , you have to take competency tests , akin to a driver 's license test , which demonstrates that not only can you shoot straight , but that you also know the law and how to store your firearm safely			2
next , law enforcement conducts a background check that runs an applicant 's criminal history and also tries to assess whether the applicant has a propensity for violence , may be mentally ill or suffers from an addiction that might cloud their judgment			2
an applicant must give references whom the authorities will interview , including relatives and a spouse , if that 's possible , @entity107 said			0
authorities go a step further , checking medical information and digging into any instances of domestic violence or employment issues			2
once licensed , gun owners must reapply and requalify for their licenses every two to 10 years			2
@entity11 law also helps ensure that only one gun per person is approved			1
if someone is a sport shooter or has a reason that for needing to own more than one gun , he must file a separate application and explain , @entity107 said			2
the law is n't a fix - all the law is n't perfect			2
as one @entity11 correspondent put it , guns are still very much a part of the culture			1
signs at @entity11 airports and casinos point to where consumers should drop off their weapons			1
and gun ownership advocates say that is why people are still incredibly afraid of hearing someone creeping in their house at night			2
there are about 2,000 guns stolen from legal gun owners in @entity11 every month , according to @entity108			1
between april 2005 and march 2011 , more than 18,000 police firearms were reportedly stolen or lost			2
guns have gone missing from police stations			0
there 's also a severe backlog in gun license applications , some of which date back several years			0
a task force has been appointed to look into the problem , @entity107 said			0
all of this has highlighted one fact for the country gun rights organization @entity264 of @entity11			1
executive @entity265 told @entity0 that it is " dead easy " to get weapons illegally			0
and there 's little reason for armed burglars to think they 'll be caught and punished			0
the rate of arrest and prosecution in the country is 7 % , said former detective @entity275 , who wrote a book about home invasions and now trains @entity11 police			1
he believes there 's one chief reason for that : few @entity11 trust law enforcement because in recent years , the police force has become politicized , with higher ranking officers who are politically appointed			1
" in 1994 there was a push to have policing more community - focused , there was more legislation to focus on that , " he said			0
" there was a distrust related to our heritage , " he says , referring to apartheid , " and unfortunately , over the years , we 've gone back to that			0
i saw it often when i was a detective			0
there are undoubtedly more home invasions , he said , than are officially counted			0
" people do n't even want to report a crime , " he said , " because they do n't believe anything is going to come of it			2
