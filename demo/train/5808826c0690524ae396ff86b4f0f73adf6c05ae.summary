-- puffing on electronic cigarettes is already a no - no on flights , but the government wants there to be no doubt			1
the @entity7 is proposing to explicitly ban the use of the devices on planes			1
" airline passengers have rights , and this new rule would enhance passenger comfort and reduce any confusion surrounding the use of electronic cigarettes in flight , " said transportation secretary @entity11			1
electronic cigarettes look like the real thing , but they 're actually battery - operated devices that turn nicotine into a vapor that is inhaled by the user , according to the @entity26			1
they 're a potential cause for concern because " there is a lack of scientific data and knowledge of the ingredients in electronic cigarettes , " the @entity27 said			1
but the @entity36 criticized the move , insisting that the devices only emit water vapor			2
" it makes absolutely zero sense , " said @entity39 , the group 's ceo			2
" it only gives the smoker a dosage of nicotine , but it does n't do anything else to the innocent bystander			0
... i have sat next to people who wore a particular type of cologne that was far more intrusive than what this particular product is			0
" the @entity27 believes its current ban on smoking of tobacco products is broad enough to include electronic cigarettes , but wants to eliminate any confusion			1
some airline passengers have been " vaping " on planes , convinced that the devices are exempt from the ban			1
in july , a @entity66 , @entity67 , man was arrested after an altercation that began when he started using an electronic cigarette on board a @entity72 flight from @entity73 to @entity74			0
the story prompted hundreds of comments from @entity0 readers , many defending electronic cigarettes and arguing they 're a smoke - free way to provide relief for passengers suffering from nicotine withdrawals during a flight			1
" the problem is not with the people using this device , but with the people around them who are psychologically affected by the fact that it looks like a cigarette and someone is sucking on it , " one commenter wrote			0
but others worried about the safety of using the devices at 35,000 feet , as well as their health effects on others			0
" i sat next to someone who was e-smoking and it 's impossible to contain all of the nicotine mist			0
i do n't want to breathe that stuff and should n't have to sit next to someone on a plane who is spewing chemically loaded mist			0
get a patch or nicotine gum if your addiction is that bad , " a commenter wrote			0
the @entity27 's proposed rule would apply to all @entity114 and foreign airlines on scheduled flights to and from the @entity114			2
officials are also considering whether to extend the ban on smoking to charter flights			2
@entity119 has already banned the use of e-cigarettes on trains and in any area where smoking is prohibited , the @entity27 said , and the @entity125 does n't allow them below decks in submarines			2
the government will accept public comments on the proposal until november 14 .			0
