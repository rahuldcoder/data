now @entity7 needs to reconnect with the @entity20 public and ( make the case of ) why he should be re-elected			2

he stopped playing small ball , " @entity9 said			0
" @entity3 gets to play offense for a while			2
he can stress the message ' we ca n't afford another four years of this			0
' talk about how ( he 's ) going to get command of the economy			0

" he was terrible last night and i do n't understand why , " @entity9 said			0

" @entity3 gains a little bit of momentum			2
the big question in this is whether or not he can sustain it , " said @entity78 , associate professor of political science at @entity38			0
" at this stage in the game , with this race being as close as it is , you do n't want to make unforced errors			0
that ca n't happen again			0
" inside the campaign , there already appears to be activity around retooling its approach			0
" obviously , moving forward we will take hard look at this and make judgments where to draw lines in debates and how to use our time , " said senior @entity7 campaign adviser @entity94 thursday in a conference call with reporters , adding that @entity7 is " eager " for the next debate			1

body language : ' @entity3 was able to out @entity7 @entity7 ' campaign experts say the turnaround comes not a moment too soon			1

" @entity3 did a good job of redeeming himself of all the gaffes of september			2
he gave a clear case of why he did n't think @entity7 deserved a second term , " @entity78 said			0
but , with just a few weeks before the general election , @entity3 has to do a lot more than say @entity7 does n't deserve a second chance , she said			1
" you have to convince voters your vision is better , " she said			0
" it has to be consistent from here on out , or last night 's performance was an anomaly			0
" @entity162 tried to downplay the impact of @entity3 's debate win			1
" i think that governor @entity3 is certainly a skilled debater			0
and last night he was able to elevate his level of performance			0
but he did not change the fundamental dynamics of this race , nor did he change some of the policies that actually got us into the economic mess that we have , " @entity170 gov. @entity169 , a top surrogate for @entity7 , told @entity1			0
