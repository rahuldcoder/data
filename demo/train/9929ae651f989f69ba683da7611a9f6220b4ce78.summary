it 's a formula that 's been tried and tested in countless erotic novels in recent memory			2
a rich , handsome man charms a young innocent with lavish gifts and bold declarations of desire			0
with a smoldering gaze , he melts her insides , turns her legs to jelly and paralyzes her subconscious , paving the way for hot sex scenes while she attempts to crack his steely veneer			0
formulaic as it is , @entity18 ' " @entity17 " trilogy is poised to become one of the fastest - selling series in recent years , with 20 million copies sold in the @entity22 and 31 million worldwide since march			1
movie rights are spoken for , and in addition to becoming the subject of online parodies , a " @entity31 " sketch , a musical and hotel marketing gimmicks , the s&m - flavored love story of a recent college grad and a billionaire ceo is also credited with boosting sales of sex toys , driving women to hook - up sites and fueling a craze over sexual domination			2
what 's behind the trilogy 's runaway success ? the books hit the romance novel scene at just the right moment , insiders say , riding a wave of smart marketing and benefiting from the erotica world 's e-book savvy			1
plus , if the plot and characters sounds a bit like " twilight " fan fiction , it 's because they 're modeled after them			2
the most potent ( and obvious ) factor is that sex sells , and kinky romances like " @entity17 " are sating women 's lust for erotica - lite , said @entity63 , author of " what you really really want : the @entity67 's @entity66			1
" " the popularity of ' @entity17 ' speaks to the fact that the dominant model of mainstream pornography and ideas of sex are targeted at men			1
the fantasy starts when he 's into it and ends when he 's done , " she said			2
" a lot of women have said that they 've learned the most about what sex could be for them from erotica novels , " she said			2
" these stories focus on female desire and what 's in it for the woman , and there 's not a lot of that in mainstream culture			2
" whatever the case , sex has long been selling erotic tales , earning spots on best - seller lists and testing attitudes toward sexuality			0
the heroine in @entity102 author @entity101 's " @entity103 " consented to being whipped and branded more than 50 years before @entity17 signed @entity17 's non-disclosure agreement and terms for becoming his submissive in " @entity17			1
" casting ' @entity17 ' in the interim , dozens of erotic romance novels by authors such as @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 have landed on best - seller lists , firmly establishing the genre as a major player in the publishing industry			1
romance readers , known for their voracious literary appetites , were among the first adopters of e-books , said @entity119 , spokeswoman for publisher @entity120 , which has been carrying erotic novels since 2006			2
" they love to consume many novels at once , and e-books are an easy way to carry them around			0
" the " @entity17 " books were originally released as e-books by the writers @entity128 , an independent publisher based in @entity131			1
they were instant hits , drawing attention of fans and @entity135 , which acquired the rights in march and published them as e-books first and then as paperbacks			2
" ' @entity17 ' is no different from what 's already being sold			1
the major difference is that it has somehow become a part of current pop culture , of the zeitgeist			0
people wo n't stop talking about it , so it perpetuates the sales , perpetuates the mythos , of this work as some sort of watershed for erotic fiction , " said @entity144 , features editor of @entity146 , the pioneering literary review journal formerly known as @entity146			0
" in truth , romance fiction and erotica have been this ' naughty ' for decades â€” naughtier , even ! " she said in an e-mail			0
" in essence , it 's the phenomenon of @entity164 that has snowballed its popularity for readers more than the actual text			1
" @entity168 : @entity169 if so , much of the success of the " @entity17 " trilogy may simply reside in its packaging			1
after acquiring @entity175 rights in march , @entity135 released digital editions of all three books , followed by print versions in april featuring relatively tame covers compared with bodice - rippers of yore			1
where one might expect two milky bodies intertwined , the covers of books one and two feature a gray silk tie and a bedazzled face mask			1
" we felt that discreet , tasteful covers certainly would being in new readers who may not have bought the books with more explicit covers , " @entity135 spokesman @entity190 said			1
the formula seems to have paid off , and since then , the romance industry has been keen to reap the benefits of judging a book by its cover			0
not long after the series took off , @entity120 and other publishers began reissuing old titles with toned - down covers			1
" what may have tipped the scale for the ' @entity17 ' trilogy in particular are the nondescript covers			1
for whatever reason , the classic ' clinch ' covers on a lot of romance novels tend to carry a stigma of being ' old - fashioned , ' so the covers on ' @entity17 ' may have made the books more approachable for a larger range or readers , " @entity146 editor @entity207 said			1
" certainly , there are some who might prefer to read romance on the privacy of an e-reader , but what 's really refreshing for me to see is the large number of women reading ' @entity17 ' on the subway and at the coffee shop			1
it simply proves that while covers may play some role in readers ' preferences , it 's what 's between the covers that really counts			1
" updating a cover is n't new either , but using " iconic " or " object " imagery picked up speed a few months back in an effort to capture the momentum of " @entity17			2
" " it sends a visible signal that if you liked ' @entity17 , ' there are other titles you 'll like , " said @entity242 , executive editor with @entity243 , which is reissuing titles by best - selling authors @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 with new covers this summer			1
" tastes tend to evolve and change over time with any product , not just books			0
as time goes on you , have to refresh and update your way of speaking to your audience			0
" best - selling author @entity109 's first self - published title , " @entity263 , " entered the @entity265 best - seller list in april despite its cover , which featured a profile shot of a naked woman with her arms wrapped across her breasts and a man on his knees , his face pressed into the small of her back			0
when @entity275 took over the title in may , the cover art changed to an image of a pair of cufflinks			0
the title is no. 4 on the @entity265 best - seller list , right behind the three " @entity17 " books , and can be found on bookshelves in @entity282 next to " @entity17			1
" " many new readers have discovered erotic romance and want to read more , but the more explicit covers do n't appeal to them , " said @entity283 , executive editor of @entity275			2
" publishers are smartly responding to the marketplace and adjusting the cover approach for some erotic romance titles			2
cufflinks and keychains can be just as evocative as bare skin			0
" @entity294 says she has received mixed reaction to the change from fans			0
those who self - identify as avid readers and rely on cover art to identify the myriad subgenres within the romance category complained that the new cover obscured the novel 's meaning			2
others , however , welcomed the change and said it led them to finally purchase the book , where before , they did n't want to be seen carrying it around			0
" ' @entity17 ' readers and new readers of ' @entity263 ' do n't tend to self - identify as readers per se , and they want books they can take out in public , whereas romance readers do n't care			1
they have adopted strategies over years , with e-books and book covers , and they 'll go out with a book regardless of the cover , " she said			0
" for those who are getting back into reading with ' @entity17 ' and ' @entity263 , ' it 's a very new thing they 're stepping into , and they want it to be an easy transition			1
" e-books have also helped to ease the transition by offering newcomers to the genre a way to read in virtual anonymity , said @entity332 , a @entity333 - based writer , sex educator and reproductive rights advocate			0
its second wave of popularity came through word of mouth once it started receiving widespread coverage in mainstream news outlets and popular culture			0
" it 's been parodied on ' snl ' and on the cover of @entity346			0
who wants to be left out of the conversation ? " she said			0
" plus , @entity350 is appealing because while many @entity22 have heard of ' @entity17 ' and can tell you it 's an erotic book , not as many can tell you what the letters @entity350 stand for , so there 's this allure , the siren call to find out more			1
" for the next few months , expect publishers to bet on that desire and reissue more bdsm titles from the past dressed up in scarves , leather belts and feathers until the next trend rolls around			1
" you ca n't create a moment like this , because if you could , we 'd do it all the time , " said @entity366 , of @entity243			0
" it just ends up that the stars align and something breaks in a major way at the right time that ends up hitting readers and grows like wildfire			0
you ca n't really explain it all the way			0
it 's just one of those moments			0

@entity18 ' " @entity17 " books have sold 31 million copies worldwide since march
insiders say books benefited from *perfect* storm of smart marketing and e-book mania
some credit trilogy 's tame covers with bringing in new audience of erotica readers
hoping to mimic its success , publishers reissue erotica titles minus *sensual* covers
