-- homeland security secretary @entity1 on friday canceled the controversial virtual fence along the @entity4 border with @entity5 , citing technical problems , cost overruns and schedule delays since its inception in 2005			1
the @entity11 , a high - tech surveillance system to reduce border smuggling , so far has cost taxpayers almost $ 1 billion for two regions in @entity16 , covering just 53 miles overall on the 2,000 - mile border , according to a homeland security report			1
@entity20 announced " a new path forward for security technology " along the border that is tailored to the needs of each region and provides " faster deployment of technology , better coverage , and a more effective balance between cost and capability , " she said in a prepared statement			2
" there is no ' one - size - fits - all ' solution to meet our border technology needs , " @entity20 said about her decision to end the problem - plagued virtual fence			1
her new plan would use mobile surveillance systems , drones , thermal imaging devices , and tower - based remote video surveillance , she said			0
" where appropriate , this plan will also incorporate already existing elements of the former @entity47 program that have proven successful , such as stationary radar , and infrared and optical sensor towers , " @entity20 said			0
sen. @entity50 , @entity51 , chairman of the @entity52 , lauded the decision			0
" the secretary 's decision to terminate @entity47 ends a long - troubled program that spent far too much of the taxpayers ' money for the results it delivered , " @entity50 said in a written statement			1
" from the start , @entity47 's one - size - fits - all approach was unrealistic			0
the department 's decision to use technology based on the particular security needs of each segment of the border is a far wiser approach , and i hope it will be more cost effective			2
" rep. @entity74 , @entity75 , ranking member of the @entity76 , said the virtual fence " has been a grave and expensive disappointment since its inception			1
" @entity74 said he is glad that homeland security officials are " finally listening to what we have been saying for years -- that the sheer size and variations of our borders show us a one - stop solution has never been best , " he said in a prepared statement			1
" i applaud them for taking this critical step toward using a more tailored technologically based approach to securing our nation 's borders			0
" the decision ends the work of federal contractor @entity97 to build the virtual fence , and the homeland security agency will conduct open bidding for the new border plan , agency officials said			1
@entity97 spokeswoman @entity102 said in a statement that the firm remains " committed to providing valuable solutions and supporting " the federal agency			0
" we appreciate that they recognize the value of the integrated fixed towers @entity97 has built , tested , and delivered so far , " @entity102 said			0
" we are proud of the accomplishments of our team and of the unprecedented capabilities delivered in the last year that provide @entity116 agents increased safety , situational awareness , and operational efficiency			0
" @entity20 said " unprecedented " manpower , infrastructure and resources along the border will complement her new border security plan			2
the @entity4 @entity116 is better staffed than at any time in its 86 - year history , having nearly doubled the number of agents from approximately 10,000 in 2004 to more than 20,500 in 2010 , according to a homeland security report			1
@entity130 has increased the number of federal agents deployed to the @entity134 border , with a quarter of its personnel currently in the region			0
president @entity137 has also deployed 1,200 @entity138 to the border			0
in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 , federal agents seized more than $ 282 million in illegal currency , more than 7 million pounds of drugs , and more than 6,800 weapons along the border -- increases of more than $ 73 million , more than 1 million pounds of drugs and more than 1,500 weapons compared with 2007 - 2008			2
also , the @entity116 's nationwide apprehensions of undocumented immigrants decreased from nearly 724,000 in 2008 to about 463,000 in 2010 , a 36 percent reduction , indicating that fewer people are attempting to illegally cross the border , a homeland security report said .			1
