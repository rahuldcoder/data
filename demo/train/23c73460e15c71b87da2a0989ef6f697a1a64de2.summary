-- there will be no repeat of the 2012 men 's singles final at the @entity4 after defending champion @entity5 was drawn friday in the same half as @entity7 - ranked @entity8 for this year 's second grand slam of the season			1
it means the pair are likely to face each other in the semifinals at @entity15 as @entity5 bids for an eighth crown and reigning @entity19 champion @entity8 attempts to take the @entity4 for the first time			1
with @entity21 withdrawing earlier this week through injury , @entity5 has been promoted to third seed			2
read : @entity24 forced out of clay court grand slam the @entity27 spent nearly eight months on the sidelines himself but since his return has won six tournaments , including back to back @entity32 titles in @entity33 and @entity34 , lifting him up the rankings			0
he shrugged off the possibility of facing @entity8 in the last four rather than the final			2
" it is what it is			0
if he and i are not number one and two in the world , then this can happen , " @entity5 told the official @entity4 website			2
" but the tournament starts with the first round , and i 'm sure both of us know we have a hard path before that			0
" @entity5 will open proceedings against @entity55 's @entity54 , but a potential third round match would pit him against @entity57 , who shocked him at last year 's @entity58 ahead of his lengthy injury layoff			2
@entity8 , who beat @entity5 in april in the final of the @entity61 , will play @entity63 's @entity62 in the first round			1
in the other half , second seed @entity64 will play qualifiers in this first two matches , with home hope @entity68 a likely quarterfinal opponent and fourth seed @entity71 of @entity72 in the semifinals			1
the women 's draw has been kind to @entity76 , who will begin her campaign against @entity78			1
defending champion and second seed @entity79 has the tougher test , with @entity19 winner and third seed @entity82 in her half of the draw			1
but the @entity86 superstar is just proud to be back with the clay court grand slam under her belt			0
" it 's very meaningful to come back as defending champion , " she said			1
" of course , there 's always a bit of pressure coming back			0
but the draw looks good			0
" action gets underway sunday , but in the qualifying tournament friday there was defeat for former @entity101 @entity100			0
the @entity55 has been plagued by injuries since reaching the quarterfinals in @entity104 two years ago and went out to @entity105 ' s @entity106 after three grueling sets .			0

@entity5 and @entity8 drawn in same half at @entity4
means there will be no repeat of 2012 final -- won by @entity5
@entity64 seeded to face @entity71 in the other semifinal
@entity76 and defending champion @entity79 *separated* in women 's draw
