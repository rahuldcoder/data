to many viewers on the political right , @entity8 's " @entity7 " is a patriotic film that celebrates a war hero and does n't shy away from the truth about the terrorist threat			1
to some on the left , it glorifies an unjust war while paying homage to an unapologetic killer with a simplistic , good - versus - evil view of the world			1
which is closer to the truth ? neither , say the movie 's makers			1
in recent interviews , @entity8 , screenwriter @entity20 and star @entity21 have said they are dismayed by attempts to ascribe political meanings to what they see as primarily a portrait of real - life @entity30 sniper @entity29 and the @entity33 's impact on him			1
the movie " certainly has nothing to do with any ( political ) parties or anything , " @entity8 told the @entity34			1
" these fellows who are professional soldiers , @entity30 personnel or what have you , go in for a certain reason ... and there 's no political aspect there other than the fact that a lot of things happen in war zones			1
" " for me , and for @entity8 , this movie was always a character study about what the plight is for a soldier ... " @entity21 told the @entity57			1
" but i ca n't control how people are gon na use this movie as a tool , or what they pick and choose ( to argue )			1
" no , he ca n't			1
ever since " @entity7 " broke box - office records with a stunning $ 107 million last weekend , everyone seems to have an opinion about it			1
pundits , veterans and @entity69 critics on all sides of the political spectrum have spent the past week poring over the film 's 132 minutes , and the memoir by @entity29 on which it 's based , in search of fodder for political arguments			2
" there is nothing even close to moral equivalence in ' @entity7 , ' only the truth : that there is no equivalence between the ( @entity85 ) barbarians who target the innocent and the @entity89 heroes who target those who target the innocent , " wrote @entity91 on @entity92 , a right - wing website which calls the movie a " pro-war - on - terror masterpiece			1
" " @entity8 ... makes the moral stakes almost nonexistent , " countered @entity96 of @entity97			2
" the people @entity29 shoots always represent a " savage , despicable evil , " and the physical and mental cost to other @entity89 just comes with the territory			2
it 's a @entity105 platform movie			2
" many others , from @entity107 and @entity108 ( on the left ) to @entity110 and @entity111 ( on the right ) , have since piled on			2
a few people even took to @entity114 to say the film made them want to kill @entity116 and @entity117			2
all the controversy is no doubt drawing more people to the movie			2
but " @entity7 's " makers say many of these viewers are missing the point			1
" people see the movie poster , and it 's got a guy and the @entity89 flag , and they know @entity8 â€” the @entity129 guy and the @entity105 convention guy -- directed it			2
so they think it 's some jingoistic thing , " screenwriter @entity20 told @entity132			2
" i would challenge that in a big way , " he added			2
" @entity29 was a man who believed in something and who therefore was useful to a government that needed him to go to war			0
it cost him his physical health , his mental health and almost cost him his family			0
" art , misunderstood " sniper " is n't the first artistic work to find itself claimed by both sides in our cultural and political wars			1
in 1984 , @entity152 's song " born in the @entity89 , " written from the point of view of a contemptuous @entity156 veteran in a dead - end world , found itself celebrated for its rousing chorus			0
during that year 's presidential campaign , no less a figure than @entity160 praised the @entity163 rocker for his " message of hope			0
" @entity152 , a defiant supporter of the underdog , was n't amused			0
" i think people have a need to feel good about the country they live in , " he said in an interview at the time			0
" but what 's happening , i think , is that that need -- which is a good thing -- is getting manipulated and exploited			0
" then there was @entity177 's " @entity176 , " a film inspired by @entity177 's father , an upstanding broker much like the movie 's @entity180 , played by @entity182			0
but the character from the movie who became celebrated was @entity186 ( played by the @entity188 - winning @entity187 ) , an unscrupulous shark who famously declared , " @entity189 , for lack of a better word , is good			1
" @entity186 became a model for a generation of aspiring @entity194			0
even today , people hoping for the big kill keep @entity186 's quotes handy , aphorisms to live by			0
finally , there 's " @entity200 , " @entity202 's famed folk song , remembered by generations of schoolchildren as a paean to @entity89 's glory			0
it 's that , to be sure -- @entity202 really does celebrate " golden valleys " and " diamond deserts " -- but the song was also a reaction to a song @entity202 loathed : @entity214 's " @entity213 , " particularly as sung by @entity215			0
@entity202 made no secret of his loyalties in one rarely sung verse			0
" in the shadow of the steeple i saw my people , / by the relief office i seen my people / as they stood there hungry , i stood there asking / is this land made for you and me ? " ' the toll is man ' yes , " @entity7 " encourages audiences to root for @entity29 and his fellow soldiers as they respond in horror to 9/11 , face dangerous insurgents who try to bomb them and track down one especially lethal enemy sniper			1
and yes , it ends with real - life 2013 footage of thousands of @entity89 lining highways , waving flags , as @entity29 's funeral procession goes by			0
but in subtle ways , the movie 's message , and morality , is not so black and white			0
one scene shows @entity21 , as @entity29 , expressing dismay that his first kill as a sniper is not of an enemy soldier but of a young boy holding a bomb			1
another scene shows a grieving mother at the funeral of her son , an @entity85 veteran , reading aloud a letter from him questioning the point of the war			0
by the time he returns from his fourth tour in @entity85 , @entity29 has clearly lost his appetite for warfare			0
he is alienated and withdrawn from his wife			0
and as in his @entity188 - winning " @entity264 , " @entity20 and @entity8 -- who has said he opposed the invasion of @entity85 -- seem less interested in glorifying the act of killing than in exploring the psychic toll it takes on the men who do it			0
" the cost is man , the toll is man , and it 's this man and every other soldier that fights , " @entity20 told @entity270			1
" if we understand that , maybe we wo n't be so hasty into jumping into war			0
" if there 's a message in " @entity7 , " it may be that @entity89 could do a better job of understanding what our veterans go through , and of taking care of them when they return			1
then again , maybe the message of " @entity7 " is whatever you want it to be			1
" it is one man 's war -- not the nation 's , " wrote @entity294 , an @entity85 veteran ( and no stranger to controversy himself ) , in @entity298			0
" while ( other war ) films have loud , overt messages that allow us to confront the issues head on , ' @entity7 ' is sort of an empty cipher , waiting for us to project already existent emotions onto the screen			1

" @entity7 " has been misunderstood by some *moviegoers* who politicize it
*filmmakers* say their focus was to create " a character study about what the plight is for a soldier "
