" some of them can not hear , some of them have really lost their eyesight almost , but you still , most of them had good memories			0
" and those are the ones that we called upon to testify			0
" in the 1960s , as a young @entity2 agent , @entity1 investigated civil rights cases in @entity20			1
" the 1960s were turbulent years in @entity20			1
oh , my goodness , " @entity1 said			2
" oh , we had a lot of action			0
" in 2005 , after he 'd been retired for years , the @entity2 asked him to help re-examine dozens of unsolved civil rights cases that had slipped through history 's cracks			1
" i never in my wildest dreams thought the @entity2 would call upon a 75 - year - old man to assist them , " @entity1 said of his work in the bureau 's cold - case initiative			1
