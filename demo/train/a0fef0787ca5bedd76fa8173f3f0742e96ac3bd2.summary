-- @entity2 cricket legend @entity1 has described how the unfolding crisis in @entity4 revived harrowing memories of a similar earthquake in his own region			1
the devastating 7.6 magnitude quake struck northern @entity2 and the divided @entity7 in october 2005 , claiming the lives of almost 80,000 people , according to official estimates , and leaving millions homeless			1
@entity1 , who is now a prominent politician and campaigner for social issues in @entity2 , told @entity0 thursday that he was left numbed by the scenes which greeted him as he traveled to some of the worst - affected areas in the aftermath			1
" it was one of the most traumatic experiences i 've ever had			2
just watching human suffering , he said			2
" it was the children that really disturbed me ... their crushed limbs			2
" there were so many people needing attention			0
i remember seeing makeshift hospitals where they were amputating			0
that was difficult to take			0
" families were torn apart as parents lost their children and children were orphaned			0
whole families were caught inside buildings , while few escaped			0
" @entity1 recalled being overwhelmed by the sight of an entire town being reduced to rubble			1
" we arrived in the town of @entity45 and it was totally flattened			2
you do n't know what to do or say			0
so many people needing help at one time and you do n't have the infrastructure , you do n't have the hospitals to help			0
" desperation grips @entity4 capital @entity45 was one of the worst - hit places , with one in 10 of about 20,000 residents killed , according to the local government of the @entity60 district , where the town of is located			1
@entity2 authorities later planned to move the town in the country 's @entity65 to a completely new location , owing to its current position on a volatile fault line			1
the destruction of @entity45 brought home to @entity1 how much people had lost			1
" their livelihoods disappeared overnight , " he said			1
" they had nothing , no business , money , food			1
" from what i 've seen on television it 's similar to what is happening now in @entity4			1
clearly they ( @entity4 ) wo n't have the resources to cope with it , so it will require a real outside effort			2
" while acknowledging the importance of the international aid effort , @entity1 pointed to role ordinary @entity2 played in 2005			1
the government was incapacitated but there were little charities and groups forming all over the area trying to help			0
" i was in an earthquake - hit area on the second day and i 'll never forget seeing a three - mile queue of people trying to get to what was a largely remote area to help with whatever they could put in their cars			0
" the government was paralyzed but people came forward , from rich to poor , young to old			0
" he also pointed to the success volunteer networks had in adopting villages and towns , taking responsibility for providing basic shelter , food and medicine			2
" everyone took responsibility , " recalled @entity1			1
" each group would look after a specific issue until the local population was able to get back on its feet			0
" it 's so important that the aid effort continues months after the disaster			0
