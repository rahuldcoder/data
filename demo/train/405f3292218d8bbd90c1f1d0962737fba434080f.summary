-- @entity2 's government has asked @entity4 's top spy chief stationed in the country to leave			1
it 's a punitive gesture usually reserved for adversarial nations in times of crisis and only very rarely for an ally , particularly a very close one			0
but allegations of @entity4 spying have seriously injured @entity15 trust , chancellor @entity11 has said			1
and it 's time for a reset			0
@entity2 let loose the diplomatic slap , reminiscent of a @entity20 rebuke , after news of two new possible @entity4 espionage cases broke back to back in a week 's time			2
two @entity15 -- one working at a @entity15 intelligence agency , the other in the @entity26 -- are suspected of spying for the @entity4			1
local media report that both cases involve stolen official @entity15 documents			2
the @entity4 official shown the door is based in @entity32 at the @entity4 embassy , which followed up on friday 's announcement with a note to journalists : " the @entity4 @entity33 has seen the reports that @entity2 has asked the @entity2 's intelligence chief to leave the country			2
as a standard practice , we will not comment on intelligence matters			0
" a @entity15 official confirmed that person was the @entity45 's station chief and that the agency 's director , @entity46 , has talked multiple times with his @entity15 counterpart			2
' so much stupidity ' top @entity15 government officials have candidly spoken about the decision to expel the @entity4 official as they poured their disappointment over alleged @entity4 spying into microphones and cameras for days			1
most pointedly , finance minister @entity57 casually described the alleged @entity4 actions as " daft " before a television talk show audience			1
" one can only cry over so much stupidity , " he said			0
he based his remarks on the essential value of @entity2 's cooperation with @entity4 intelligence agencies to fight international terrorism and complained that spying spoils the relationship			1
legal action the latest allegations weigh densely on ties already burdened since @entity71 leaked indications that the @entity73 tapped into @entity11 's own cell phone			1
they have seemingly undone any of @entity77 's diplomatic smoothing over previously alleged @entity73 intrusions			1
one of the new cases has landed on top of an existing investigation on federal prosecutors ' desks into the possible spying on @entity11			1
the @entity73 scandal has also prompted prosecutors to set up a new special committee to investigate and criminally prosecute cyberspying by foreign intelligence			1
@entity11 deferred to the pending results of those investigations , but it did n't stop her from expressing on thursday the disappointment she feels over the suspected acts			2
" from a common sense standpoint , in my opinion , spying on allies is , in the end , a waste of energy			0
we have so many problems , and we should , i find , concentrate on the essentials			0
" @entity106 , @entity107 , terrorism -- all take priority over spying on each other , she said			0
and trust between allies is vital			0
privacy is sacred to understand @entity2 's particular hurt over spying allegations , one need only to look at the country 's history in the 20th century , when oppressive fascist and communist regimes spied on citizens in order to persecute them			1
during the @entity20 , high - level spy scandals stoked division between then divided democratic @entity124 and communist @entity125			0
the scandals triggered government shakedowns and deep public outrage in the @entity124			0
as a result of the @entity132 past , democratic , postwar @entity2 has instituted very strict privacy laws that prohibit government agencies , companies and private individuals from gathering or passing even simple information about citizens without their express consent			0
or in criminal cases , without probable cause			0
data protection is so sacred in @entity2 that advertisers there are prevented from profiling prospective consumers			0
top @entity4 , @entity15 diplomats to meet amid the new allegations , the top @entity4 and @entity15 diplomats are expected to meet in @entity151 , @entity152 , this weekend during multination negotiations about the future of @entity156 's nuclear program , a senior @entity148 official said			1
while the official said @entity4 secretary of state @entity159 and @entity15 foreign minister @entity160 will touch on topics such as the @entity162 and @entity163 , it 'd be hard to imagine the two ignoring the spy issue			1
across the @entity165 in @entity77 , the new allegations have also raised the eyebrows of some elected officials			2
" i am concerned that we are sending the wrong message to a key ally , " said @entity169 sen. @entity168 of @entity170			0
otherwise , administration officials have countered their @entity15 counterparts ' candor with lips as sealed as those at the @entity33 in @entity32			1
@entity180 spokesman @entity179 declined to comment on the reported intelligence activity as a matter of policy , to protect @entity4 national security and " intelligence assets			0
" " i 'm not going to have anything more to add on that front , " @entity148 spokeswoman @entity186 told a journalist who asked if reports of @entity2 booting the @entity4 intelligence official were true			0
@entity15 journalists who contacted @entity77 officials for comment on the cases , when news of them first broke , reported receiving e-mail replies containing only two words , which they included in their articles in the original @entity201 : " no comment			2
" @entity2 calls in @entity4 ambassador over new spying allegation @entity2 investigating alleged @entity4 surveillance of @entity11 's phone @entity206 summons @entity4 diplomat over report of @entity73 spying @entity0 's @entity210 contributed to this story .			1

the finance minister calls alleged @entity4 spying " daft , " says it makes him want to cry
