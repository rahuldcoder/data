-- @entity2 reindeer herders in northern @entity3 are getting a view from space to help them look after their herds as the region copes with climate change			1
@entity10 worries : satellite maps of snow coverage and melt can help reindeer herders			1
using satellite - based snow melt maps supplied by the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) backed program @entity18 , herders are able to view the depth of snow and judge where the best foraging spots are to take their reindeer			1
" @entity10 is of paramount importance for reindeer herding , because its quality determines whether reindeer are able to access the pastures that lie beneath it for much of the year , " @entity26 , the director of the international center for @entity28 ( @entity29 ) told the @entity17			0
" detailed circumpolar snow information is , thus , becoming increasingly important following the recent changes in the @entity2 climate			0
" @entity26 is working with @entity40 reindeer herders in @entity41 , @entity42 , to help them maintain and develop sustainable reindeer husbandry			2
according to @entity26 , @entity41 is the area of @entity42 that is predicted to experience the largest temperature increases , raising concerns about whether ice layers will form over pastures preventing reindeer from foraging			0
under the @entity18 initiative , @entity51 ( @entity51 ) have been providing snow melt maps for @entity42 and @entity54 , as well as snow cover maps for @entity56 , for the last 18 months			0
the @entity29 partnered with @entity18 in a trial of the maps to examine how satellite observations could help by gathering information on snow change in a timely manner for such vast circumpolar regions			2
" the experience so far has definitely been positive , and the reindeer herders are extremely interested in the future utilization of @entity18 products that can relate important information about local snow conditions , " said @entity26			0
" these products could have important consequences for herders ' decisions regarding winter pasture quality and potential migration routes			0
" in addition to climate change , reindeer herders also have to face a loss of pastures because of infrastructure development , such as roads , hydroelectric power dams and cabin resorts			1
the same technology would help the @entity29 to monitor the different forms of land - use change over time .			1

@entity40 herders using satellite - based maps of snow to judge best areas
climate change has made it *harder* to find foraging spots for reindeer herds
technology could also be used to monitor land - use change over time
