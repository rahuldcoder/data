the near daily stream of violence in @entity2 is a bitter reminder that the country is still far away from stabilizing and that the @entity7 - @entity6 divide , which has led to over 6000 deaths in 2013 , appears wider than ever			1
despite this climate of uncertainty and destruction , @entity2 's top energy official told @entity13 that the country 's oil production will continue to climb -- reaching at least 3.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year			1
@entity17 , the deputy prime minister for energy , said two new fields in southern @entity2 , near @entity19 and @entity20 , have revved up production			1
" these two fields will add between them 300 thousand barrels			2
there 's extra production from the other fields so when you add them up you will get to 3.5 , 3.6 million barrels a day by the end of the year , " @entity17 told me during a one - on - one interview at the @entity28 conference in @entity29			1
@entity2 has had difficulty managing expectations over the past few years			2
the original plan was to hit 6 million barrels a day by the end of this year , double that level by 2020 at the latest			0
those forecasts have been ratcheted down significantly with the government 's so - called revised integrated strategy			2
@entity17 said @entity42 needed to decide whether to front load production or set a more realistic target that will allow fields to produce more crude over the next two decades			1
" we decided to go for the second option to maximize recovery rather than hit the highest possible production in a short time , " he said			0
@entity2 was criticized within energy circles for signing service contracts that gives international energy giants a production fee of just $ 1.15 - $ 2.50 a barrel , instead of production sharing agreements that give the majors a percentage of overall production			1
@entity17 admits that strategy has forced a rethink and in some cases a revising of existing contracts			0
" i would confess that our contracts have been very tight , perhaps the toughest the oil companies had to deal with , " he said			0
" we want the oil companies to make a good profit in @entity2 and that is why we are willing to reconsider those contracts , " he added			2
the climate with its international partners is improving and @entity2 is confident it can now deliver a sizable level of production capacity by the end of the decade			2
it has committed to just over 9 million barrels a day , which would put the country in the league of @entity81 and @entity82 -- currently the two largest producers in the world			0
the @entity85 in @entity86 has expressed reservations , suggesting @entity2 will be producing 6 million barrels in that time frame			0
" all i will say , at this point , is that @entity2 has signed contracts with the largest international oil companies who have the best know - how in this field , " @entity17 said			1
" and they have very strong financial muscle , if they say they can do it , they can do it			0
" further , he added , they are bound by contract to do so			0
according to @entity105 's @entity104 , @entity2 sits on 143 billion barrels of crude , 9 % of global proven reserves			0
oil executives say there is plenty more to be found , with some 300 potential sites in the southwest of the country still not explored			0
there is speculation that thawing relations between @entity118 and @entity119 could see a partial lifting of economic sanctions on @entity122 , which has cut production by 1.5 million barrels a day			1
the deputy pm said he is hopeful negotiations will proceed in good faith , but does not expect downward pressure on prices as a result			1
however , he said , it was yet to be seen if that would reflect on oil production in the short term			1
" i personally doubt 2014 will give sufficient time even if sanctions are relaxed , " he noted .			0

the violence in @entity2 is a reminder the country is far from stable , but oil production is set to rise this year
its forecasts have *previously* been ratcheted down and more realistic targets set
deputy pm @entity17 said new fields would add to production
thawing relations between @entity118 and @entity119 could assist in this
