-- editor 's note : @entity3 a technology and engineering education teacher at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
he has a master 's degree in education and a bachelor of science degree in technology education from @entity14			1
you might have noticed a recent tv commercial from @entity17 showing a @entity17 professional next to an eighth - grade student with a robot			0
the student describes the remote control robot , and the young @entity17 professional talks about how a high school science teacher made him what he is today ( a geologist for @entity17 )			2
the next part of the commercial caught my attention , because in bold letters the words " @entity32 " flashed on the screen			0
while i agree that " science rules , " so does technology and engineering			2
what the ad is demonstrating is not science education , but rather the middle two letters of @entity42 - or science , technology , engineering and math - education			1
often technology and engineering education is overlooked when people talk about @entity42 education or when governments make decisions about education policy			1
in last year 's @entity57 address , president @entity55 called for adding " 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math. " this call for new teachers was laudable , however , science and math education receive the majority of attention and support from universities , various levels of government and the public			1
one reason is because math and science are required classes throughout a student 's educational career , unlike technology and engineering			1
additionally , as you examine the landscape of colleges and universities around the country , it 's easy to find a school where you can study to become a science or math teacher			2
unfortunately , the same can not be said for technology and engineering education as many colleges and universities have cut their programs , and sadly so have some high and middle schools			1
technology and engineering education is exhibited in many different ways when you look at that robot in the commercial			1
the physical appearance of the robot incorporates one of the main cornerstones of technology and engineering education : design			1
design in technology and engineering education can come in various forms			1
one is digital design through digital photography and @entity109 to generate a treatment and produce a video			0
another aspect covered in technology education classes focuses on engineering design by creating a more efficient shopping cart or a new blade design for a wind turbine			2
you can find many diverse concepts and principles in technology and engineering labs			2
students can learn engineering principles such as aerodynamics through the creation of carbon - dioxide - powered cars			0
students are able to explore aerospace engineering by building complex rockets and simple rubberband - powered planes that can stay in the air for minutes			0
students learn principles of chemical engineering when they make bioplastics and biofuels			0
when you look at the robot in the commercial , you can see design in the way that the robot is built and how the parts of the robot interact with one another to achieve the goals of the creator			0
here the examples of engineering become glaring and are even highlighted by the student			0
the fact that the student has four servo motors on the robot and not three , five or six demonstrates that the student used engineering concepts to determine the amount of lift , torque and speed needed to achieve the most efficient robot			0
if you were to walk into a high school technology and engineering class , the first thing you will notice is a lab full of busy students working diligently on projects and creating things			2
students are often excited to learn because they can express their creativity and apply what they are reading about and taking notes on in other classes			0
through project - based learning , students gain knowledge in different areas of technology and engineering , much of which reinforces what they have learned from their science and math teachers			2
and science , technology , engineering and math , or stem education has an important economic impact as well			1
according to a july report by the @entity195 @entity194 , @entity42 - related jobs are projected to grow by 17 % by 2018 , compared with 9.8 % for @entity197 professions			0
additionally , even in the midst of the @entity200 , @entity42 joblessness has been almost half of @entity197 jobs			0
while the unemployment for @entity197 jobs topped out around 10 % , @entity42 jobs never cracked the 6 % mark			0
as a country we need to focus on improving in all areas of science , technology , engineering and math education if we are to succeed in creating and competing for the jobs that will be prevalent in the decades to come			1
however , it 's vital to our nation and to our students not to overlook the " @entity217 " in @entity42			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity3 .			0

@entity3 is a technology and engineering education teacher in @entity8
he says that science and math often get more attention than technology and engineering
he argues that it 's vital to the nation to not overlook the " @entity232 " in @entity42 education
