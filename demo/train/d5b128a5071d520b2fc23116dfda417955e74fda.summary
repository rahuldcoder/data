-- in the spring of 1968 , the rev. @entity1 traveled to @entity2 , to join sanitation workers seeking better pay , fairer treatment and the right to form a union			1
i was with dr. @entity1 as he stood with workers , all @entity10 , all fighting years of labor repression and wages that relegated them to poverty			1
dr. @entity1 was assassinated on that trip to @entity2			1
his death , just as the images of workers carrying signs reading , " i am a man , " is forever seared in my memory			0
today , august 28 , marks the 50th anniversary of the @entity22 , the site of dr. @entity1 's historic " @entity25 " speech			2
as tens of thousands prepare to commemorate our nation 's progress toward racial justice , it 's worth remembering a central meaning of that march : economic opportunity			1
opinion : did we really learn the lesson of the march on @entity37 ? the state of economic opportunity today is a far cry from dr. @entity1 's vision			1
increasingly , @entity43 workers are struggling to make ends meet			1
each day they are forced to make impossible choices between feeding their families and keeping the lights on , paying for gas or buying a coat			0
income inequality has grown exponentially in recent years , as middle - class jobs that pay a decent wage have been replaced by part - time , low - wage work following the recession			2
all the while , corporations and ceos rake in unimaginable sums			0
nowhere is this two - tiered capitalism more dire than within the hidden workforce employed by federal contractors			0
according to a recent study by @entity66 , a public policy think tank , nearly 2 million private sector employees working on behalf of @entity43 earn wages too low to support a family , making $ 12 or less per hour			2
these are @entity43 who sweep the floors of our nation 's capital , stitch our soldiers ' uniforms and ensure quality care for the elderly and disabled , and yet they can not afford necessities like food , housing and health care			0
like the sanitation workers of @entity2 , they are the backbone of our economy , and are in turn treated like second - class citizens			1
throngs mark ' @entity25 ' anniversary dr. @entity1 stood with those on the picket line because he knew that struggles for racial and economic equality were inextricably bound			2
he championed economic opportunity and jobs knowing that an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere			1
in this way , the urgency of the current economic crisis must be understood as a civil rights imperative			0
people of color disproportionately occupy the lowest rungs of the economic ladder , mirroring the lack of opportunity that pervaded the mid- 20th century			0
just as dr. @entity1 looked toward leaders in the nation 's capital to better living standards , so too can workers turn their attention toward @entity37			2
at the height of racial tension and mass mobilization in the ' 60s , the federal government took the lead in advancing equality			0
in 1965 , president @entity122 went beyond the @entity123 , effectively ending racial discrimination in government contracting with the signing of an executive order			0
president @entity128 ought to respond to the crisis of inequality in similar fashion			1
he could -- today -- sign an executive order requiring government contractors to pay their employees higher wages			1
with a sweep of the pen , president @entity128 could honor dr. @entity1 's legacy -- and help fulfill his dream -- by mandating fairness and justice			1
it 's fitting that the protests by low - wage workers spreading across the country adopt many of the same tactics as the @entity2 sanitation workers , including the potent " i am a man " message			1
were dr. @entity1 here today , i have little doubt he would join with the striking workers of federally contracted companies , fast - food giants and @entity155			2
the struggle for labor rights and decent pay was central to the conviction that animated his life			0
10 signposts on @entity43 's race journey president @entity128 has promised to take executive action to improve the economy , circumventing a gridlocked @entity165 and raising the boats of millions of families			1
there is no better place to start than with working standards of federally contracted companies			0
more money in these workers ' pockets will yield greater consumer spending , accelerated job growth and a more robust economy			0
and there is no better time to do it			0
on the 50th anniversary of the march on @entity37 , and at a time of record levels of economic inequality , president @entity128 should follow in the footsteps of his civil rights predecessors			1
when he speaks on the steps of the @entity187 , he should outline an executive order that would raise standards for low - wage employees working on behalf of our country			0
doing so is no panacea for continuing racial and economic discrimination , but is an important step toward realizing dr. @entity1 's unfulfilled dream			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity199 was with @entity1 in @entity2 supporting living wages for sanitation workers
@entity204 : @entity1 *killed* on that trip , and his dream of economic opportunity still unmet
@entity43 struggle to make ends meet , he says , especially federal contract workers
@entity204 : president @entity128 could easily require government contractors to pay a living wage
