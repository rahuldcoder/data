-- @entity2 's defense minister blamed @entity3 for a series of bombings in the @entity7 capital of @entity8 tuesday , a day after attacks against the country 's diplomats in @entity12 and @entity13			1
" the attempted terror attack in @entity7 proves once again that @entity3 and its proxies continue to operate in the ways of terror and the latest attacks are an example of that , " said defense minister @entity14 , who issued the statement from @entity16 , where he is currently traveling			1
" @entity3 and @entity24 are unrelenting terror elements endangering the stability of the region , and endangering the stability of the world , " @entity14 added			2

the three fled after the blast			0
two of the men left the scene , he said			0
the third man detonated two more bombs -- one when a taxi driver refused to give him a ride , and another when he tried to throw a bomb at police as they closed on him			1

he was taken to @entity53 for treatment			0
@entity7 government spokeswoman @entity55 said the man in the hospital is @entity3 , and that @entity3 documents were found on him			1
another man arrested at the airport is holding an @entity3 passport and is one of the three , @entity55 said			1
he was identified as @entity63 , 42 , and was about to leave for @entity64 , she added			0
@entity55 told @entity0 that @entity7 intelligence agencies do n't think the incident was an act of terror because it was carried out in a sporadic way			0
but , she said , police think that the men may have been selling weapons and drugs			2
@entity2 @entity75 personnel based overseas have been on alert in recent weeks to the heightened possibility of attacks at @entity2 facilities by @entity24 , the @entity80 militant group and political party backed by @entity3			1
sunday marked the fourth anniversary of the death of @entity24 leader @entity84 in a car bombing in @entity86 , @entity87			0
@entity24 holds @entity2 responsible for his death and has vowed revenge			2
@entity2 police spokesman @entity91 told @entity0 that the level of alert in the country had been raised following a security assessment after the overseas incidents in @entity97 and @entity98 , the capitals of @entity12 and @entity13			1
the alert means patrols will be heightened in and around various public areas inside @entity2 , and around @entity2 embassies and offices worldwide			1
in the monday incidents , a device attached to an @entity2 @entity107 van in @entity97 exploded and injured four people			2
another device was found on an embassy car in @entity98 , @entity13 , but it was safety detonated			0
the @entity2 government issued a travel advisory this year for citizens traveling to @entity7 after @entity7 security officials arrested a man in january connected with a planned attack in the country			1
the police charged the man , @entity122 , after finding " initial chemical materials that could produce bombs " in an area just outside @entity8			1
police said @entity122 , who also holds a @entity128 passport , led them to the location			0
the authorities are accusing @entity122 of trying to attack spots in @entity8 that are popular with @entity133 tourists and say he is believed to belong to @entity24 , the @entity134 group active in @entity135 that the @entity136 views as a terrorist organization			2

@entity148 spokeswoman @entity147 said the @entity136 condemns the incident and offered its condolences to the victims			0
even as she noted that @entity7 authorities were investigating the incidents , she went on to draw a parallel between tuesday 's attacks in @entity8 and monday 's attacks against @entity2 diplomats in @entity12 and @entity13 , both of which are also under investigation			1
" what i would say is that , with regard to this bombing , the incidents in @entity97 , incidents in @entity13 , while we will await the results of the investigations , these events do come on the heels of other disrupted attacks targeted at @entity2 and @entity133 interests , including an @entity3 - sponsored attack in @entity173 , @entity174 , and a @entity24 - linked attack in @entity8 , @entity7 , before this			1
" so they serve as a reminder that a variety of states and nonstate actors continue to view international terrorism as a legitimate foreign policy tool , which we consider reprehensible			0
" while @entity147 said the @entity136 is " not going to prejudge this , " she added , " we 're just concerned that these come on the heels of other incidences that clearly had links back to @entity3			2
" @entity2 prime minister @entity190 on monday blamed the @entity13 and @entity12 incidents on @entity3 , calling it " the biggest exporter of terror in the world			1
" " the @entity2 government and her security organizations are continuing to operate together with local security services against these acts of terror , " @entity190 said			0
" we will continue to act in a strong way , systematically and steadfastly			0
" in an interview tuesday with @entity0 's @entity203 , @entity2 vice prime minister @entity201 said @entity3 has been trying to target @entity2 and @entity205 sites for " a few decades now			1
" " we knew that they are planning it , preparing it			0
we 're in touch with local governments with a few countries in @entity212 and in other places and together we -- we 're trying to prevent those attacks for a very long time , " @entity201 said			0
" unfortunately , they succeeded to do it in @entity12 and tried to do it in @entity13 and @entity174 a few weeks ago			0
that 's something @entity3 is responsible for			2
" @entity3 @entity75 spokesman @entity223 blamed @entity2 , accusing it of having bombed its own embassies in @entity97 and @entity98 " to tarnish @entity3 's friendly ties with the host countries , " @entity3 's state - run @entity221 said			1
" he brushed aside @entity2 accusation on @entity3 involvement in the bombing and said that @entity2 perpetrated the terrorist actions to launch psychological warfare against @entity3 , " @entity221 reported			1
" @entity3 condemns terrorism in strongest term and @entity3 has been the victim of terrorism , " @entity223 said			0
@entity3 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity236 , said this month that @entity3 would support any nation or group that stands up against @entity2			1
he said @entity3 does n't interfere in other nations but has aided such militant groups as @entity241 and @entity24 in conflicts with @entity2 in @entity243 and @entity135			1
the modus operandi is not new			0
