@entity0 -- former @entity4 gov. @entity3 's opposition to president @entity6 's executive action on deportations puts him in the uncomfortable position of running counter to policy moves taken by both his father and his brother during their presidencies			1
it 's the latest example of the complications @entity3 has faced on the immigration issue as he considers a 2016 presidential run			1
@entity3 has long drawn criticism from conservatives for his more moderate positions on reform , including his support for a pathway to citizenship for those here illegally			2
his friday statement on @entity6 's executive action to protect nearly 5 million immigrants from deportation was nuanced , taking aim only at the tactic , not the ultimate effect			1
" president @entity6 's ill - advised unilateral action on illegal immigration undermines all efforts to forge a permanent solution to this crisis			1
action must come in the form of bipartisan comprehensive reform passed through @entity42 , " @entity3 said			2
he later tweeted that the move was " an abuse of power			0
" but both presidents @entity45 and his son used similar unilateral action to protect immigrants from the threat of deportation under similar circumstances			1
in 2001 president @entity52 extended protections to as many as 150,000 @entity54 in the @entity55 illegally			0
and the elder @entity3 implemented a " @entity62 " policy to allow an estimated 1.5 million close family members of newly legalized immigrants under the sweeping 1986 immigration reform measure to avoid deportation while they applied for legal status			0
those moves were used by @entity64 to defend the legality of @entity6 's executive action			1
and @entity67 , a former @entity52 administration official who wrote a memo arguing for prosecutorial discretion on deportations , admitted that there was some hypocrisy from @entity73 in opposition to this move			1
" i think there 's a lot of hypocrisy on both sides , " she told @entity1 , " but certainly prosecutorial discretion has been a longstanding policy			0
" she said , however , @entity6 's move was unique because of " the broadness of the scope and the lack of individualized assessments , " and because @entity6 was expanding access to work permits			2
@entity90 echoed @entity3 's concern over the tactic used to solve the problem , saying that while she " actually liked the result that we 're getting ... it 's an odd way to do it			2
" but she also acknowledged the president was running out of options to solve the problem			0
" what was the president to do ? " @entity90 asked			0
she added : " this needed to be done			0
it 's a pretty broken system			0

@entity3 hammered @entity6 for unilateral action , but past @entity3 presidents have done similar
@entity45 , son both gave relief to *undocumented* during their presidencies
former @entity3 administration official says there 's " hypocrisy " from both parties on the issue
