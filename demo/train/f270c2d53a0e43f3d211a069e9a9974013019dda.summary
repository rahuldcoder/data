-- there 's no question that losing your job can be a jolting experience , as anyone who has had the misfortune of being laid off in recent years can attest			2
but what if that jolt could be a positive experience ? that 's the suggestion to come out of recent research which looked into the experiences of laid - off mid-to senior - level managers in the @entity15 and @entity16			1
the participants ' overwhelming response was that the experience of losing their jobs in the previous 12 months had given them a renewed interest in living according to their values			1
the " crisis " of redundancy was in fact an opportunity to get to better know themselves , and reassess their priorities to lead more fulfilled , happier lives			1
" all of the respondents , which surprised us , talked about the positives associated with this jolt of job loss , " said study co-author @entity31 , a professor of management at @entity16 's @entity33			1
" these people took that jolt and focused on the positives of it to recalibrate themselves in terms of ' who am i and what do i want from life ? ' it was counter-intuitive with what we thought was going to take place			1

she said it reflected the way people could lose themselves and gradually become divorced from their personal values as they climbed the corporate ladder			1
only a quarter of the responses from participants -- who ranged in age from their early 30s to late 50s , and nearly half of whom held doctorates -- related to feelings of self - doubt and cynicism , which the researchers had assumed would be the predominant response			1
" it 's normal to be angry and upset and scared and frustrated , and to experience not only self - doubt , but cynicism about the process and the organization , " said @entity31			2
instead , the respondents expressed a desire to lead their lives with more " authenticity " and integrity , even if it meant forgoing corporate benefits or a high salary -- perhaps a luxury that former mid-to senior - level managers can afford			1
their new priorities fit into three clear categories : the desire for a more balanced quality of life , with more time for family and friends ; more meaningful work which they felt contributed to society ; and job security and happiness			1
" people said things like : ' i did n't realize how toxic work my environment was , and how important a criterion that should be ' , " said co-author @entity111 , professor of leadership and organization development at @entity114 business school @entity113			0
said @entity31 : " all of them expressed a genuine desire to be true to oneself as they moved forward to the next chapter of their careers			0
it was everything from ' i want to spend more time with my kids ' to ' i know i have much more creative talent than i was able to demonstrate in my last job			0

" for many of us , at some level inertia takes over			2
it 's the comfort of the routine , the comfort of the expected			0
it 's hard to break out of that , " said @entity31			0
" the jolt of job loss may in fact be something that is very useful to people and there may be some very clear benefits to come from it			2
" the authors said there were lessons for organizations from their research : that cutting back hours and salaries might be a mutually satisfactory way of getting through lean times , as it would allow employees to address their work - life balance			2
where layoffs were unavoidable , organizations could offer affected employees workshops to help them to assess and prioritize their values , rather than simply update their resumes			0
more broadly , the findings were a useful reminder , as the times of economic uncertainty continued , that there was always a potential upside to a downturn			0
" there is something we can take from the @entity176 written language that they have understood for a very long time -- that crisis can mean opportunity , " said @entity31			0
" we do n't frame things that way , but maybe we should			0

new research suggests that redundancy can " jolt " people into happier , more fulfilled lives
being laid off can shock people out of their corporate " inertia " to reassess their priorities
participants in the research sought more meaningful new jobs in line with their values
