-- some years ago , i interviewed a pair of farmers selling pastured , hormone - and antibiotic - free turkeys for $ 4.75 a pound			2
they were heritage breed birds , @entity8 reds whose numbers had dwindled to dangerously low levels as the broad - breasted white -- the @entity12 -- dominated			2
at the time , the farmers were still a little queasy about slaughtering and selling livestock they 'd raised			0
( one farmer had been a longtime vegetarian			0
) but by giving these turkeys a productive death , they explained , they were actually helping them survive			0
if they were n't for dinner , these birds just were n't useful			2
they were neither cuddly nor well - behaved			2
they made terrible pets , and were n't well - suited for life in the wilderness			1
they were n't destined for poultry popularity , either -- maybe your grandparents would recognize their gamey flavor , but it was nothing like the gravy - slathered protein that generations had gobbled down over the holidays			1
but if they enticed enough @entity38 cooks to prepare them , the farmers saw a win for biodiversity and the birds			0
give them a reason to exist , and these turkeys could thrive			0
i thought of those birds recently when @entity47 president and ceo @entity46 explained sweeping changes planned for the @entity51 exam			1
come spring 2016 , the essay will be optional			0
the score scale will return to familiar ol ' 1600			0
the test prep will be free , and delivered via @entity56			2
and , the @entity51 word will be no more , @entity46 said			1
just like those old - timey turkeys , it seems there 's limited use for the $ 5 words we 've come to expect from the @entity51 " today , when we say that someone has used an @entity51 word , it often means a word you have not heard before and are not likely to soon hear again , " @entity46 explained in his announcement			1
you know these words if you took the test , its preparatory cousin , the @entity76 , or almost any college - minded standardized test			1
you flipped through their definitions on flash cards , or faced them in a spelling bee , if you were that kind of kid			0
you probably still use a number of them : " threatened , " " vigilant , " " predicting , " " ousting " and " strengthened " all appeared on an sat test in 2013			2
of course , " bellicosity , " " obduracy " and " garrulous " were on the test , too			0
after the frenzy and stress of sat cramming , the words become kind of a parenthetical joke , a chance to finally giggle at the absurdity of it all			2
drop " mellifluous " or " loquacious " into a sentence after the college applications are sent , and you can actually stop to appreciate it -- " hey , i just used an @entity51 word ! " @entity46 said he 's done indulging tricks and flash cards that promise to beat his test , especially at the expense of deep , analytical reading and understanding			1
if the college exam tests only obscure vocabulary words , " students stop reading and start flipping , " he said			1
the redesigned @entity51 will instead focus on words students are likely to use over and over again , he said , like " synthesis " and " empirical			1
" " the @entity51 will honor the best work of our classrooms -- reading widely and learning how words work in their different contexts , " he said			1
" we aim to offer worthy challenges , not artificial obstacles			0
" but i wondered , if the sat abandons these words , what will become of " treacly " and " mendacious " ? are they turkeys on the verge of extinction ? hardly , linguist @entity131 explained			1
the sat was n't keeping them alive , he said , and flash cards were n't doing justice to many words , anyway			1
sure , those quick definitions did well enough for a multiple choice test			0
" you can pick ' em out of a lineup , " said @entity131 , who teaches in @entity138			0
" if you see ' mendacious ' and you think ' dishonest , ' you 've got the main idea			0
" but " empirical , " he said ? now that 's a complex word			0
it 's got varied and layered meanings , some buried deep in history , or evolving only now			0
" under the guise of providing more user - friendly , fair tests , they 're merely substituting one set of @entity51 words for another , " @entity131 said			1
" if anything , this calls for more tutoring , and more background than the old words			0
" he suspects that students might remember more from their @entity51 study sessions than anybody realizes , but the words are even less forgettable if students learn them through reading instead of flash cards			1
regardless , the test will never get much credit ; if you memorize a word and use it often enough , he said , you 're unlikely to be able to pinpoint that you learned it for the @entity51 and if you do n't use it ? " if people do n't use the word , " @entity131 said , " it 's because they do n't need the word			1
" there are no guarantees about the vocabulary of the future sat. @entity47 certainly has n't released a list of banned words , and it 's not as if the passages will suddenly read like " @entity187			1
" it would n't be a test , @entity131 said , if everybody could answer all the questions correctly			2
" everything is an @entity51 word to somebody , " he said			1
consider just one of the changes coming to the @entity51 in 2016 : each exam will include passages from meaningful historic documents like the @entity200 , the @entity201 and the rev. @entity202 's " @entity203			1
" in @entity202 's nearly 7,000 - word letter , he dropped " cognizant , " " superficial , " " moratorium , " " unfettered , " " ominous , " " ordinance , " " paternalistically , " " incorrigible , " " zeitgeist , " " sanctimonious , " " nullification , " " gladiatorial , " " scintillating " and " existential			2
" any of them could be called an " @entity51 word			1
" any of them could be on the new test			0
so , word lovers , do not mourn the next generation 's vocabulary			2
educators , do not celebrate the end of flash cards			0
the @entity51 word is dead , long live the @entity51 word			1
these turkeys still have a long time to cook			0
what do you think of the changes to the sat ? share your thoughts in the comments , on @entity227 or on @entity230 's @entity229 page !			0

the @entity47 says the next @entity51 wo n't include little - used , forgettable " sat words "
the college test will *incorporate* words with different meanings based on context
changing the sat wo n't *necessarily* mean vocabulary words fade into obscurity
linguist : " everything is an @entity51 word to somebody "
