the latest spending came to light thursday when members of @entity11 were notified that the agency has opened an internal investigation into the roughly $ 268,000 spent for the 2010 event held not far from the @entity15 in northern @entity16			1
the agency 's preliminary review has determined that approximately $ 20,000 was spent on drumsticks given to the attendees of the award ceremony			1
a source inside the agency told @entity1 that a drum band was hired for the event and the drumsticks were given to allow attendees to play along with the band and make the activity interactive			1
troubled federal agency paid for cooking classes , hosted holiday video contest " i know , it 's ridiculous , " the source said , and acknowledged " a lot of frustration " because the agency 's new leadership is dealing with events that happened under the previous administrator			2
the source also told @entity1 there are a lot of changes and reforms coming to the agency and that some are already in place , such as a freeze on bonuses and pay raises instituted by acting administrator @entity49 , who took over after the previous administrator resigned			0
in addition to $ 20,000 for drumsticks , the agency 's inspector general also informed @entity11 on thursday that a preliminary review has found the spending included roughly $ 34,000 for the venue , including catering charges , room rental charges and @entity60 charges ; roughly $ 7,700 for a reception at a second hotel for the same one - day awards ceremony ; and approximately $ 104,000 for logistical and management services provided by a outside vendor			1
in a statement provided to @entity1 , the @entity3 said this type of spending " is not tolerated			2
" " this event took place in 2010 and has been in existence going back to 2002 , " the agency said			0
" today , under the new @entity3 leadership , this event and type of spending is not tolerated			2
as of april 2012 all spending for events , including training conferences , leadership events , team building exercises , award ceremonies , were suspended			0
these events indicate an already recognized pattern of misjudgment which spans several years and administrations			0
it must stop , and is why acting administrator @entity49 has instituted several stringent new policies on spending to put an end to this misuse of taxpayer dollars			0
