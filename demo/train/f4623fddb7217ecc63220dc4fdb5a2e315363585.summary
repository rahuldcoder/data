-- well humans , it 's been a good ride , but after being eviscerated by @entity6 's supercomputer @entity7 on " @entity8 , " it 's probably time to pack up the truck and let the machines inherit the @entity11			1
or is it ? despite @entity7 's tremendous performance , the @entity8 question at the end of tuesday night 's airing revealed the @entity17 that computer scientists have known all along : @entity7 does n't really " think " anything , and it struggles with simple questions that most humans can answer without a second thought			1
most of the clues on the " @entity8 ! " board mention proper nouns -- specific places , events , people , songs , books and so on , says dr. @entity33 , a machine learning pioneer , former @entity35 professor of computer science and ceo of @entity38 , a company that develops semantic technologies			1
" this gives the @entity7 algorithm a great deal of ' traction			2
' to us viewing the show , it 's impressive if it correctly knows that @entity49 's birth date was january 31 , 1797			2
but if that date had been part of the clue , could @entity7 correctly pick out [ @entity49 's ] maternal grandmother 's birth date from a list where only one of the dates was earlier than 1797 ? " we could , because we understand that everyone is younger than their own mother and grandmother , but @entity7 is unable to understand this , @entity33 explained			1
at the end of the day , @entity7 is not really conceptualizing a clue 's meaning			1
it simply number - crunches its way to the right answers by comparing vast amounts of data			0
this is why it dominates the " fill in the blank " knowledge clues ( @entity78 , spoken in ancient times , was a dialect of this ) , but falters on some more " common sense " deductions			0
the biggest blunder was in the first game 's @entity8 round			1
@entity33 broke down @entity6 's explanation of why @entity7 guessed " @entity84 ? " to the clue in the category of " @entity88 cities : " " namely , the string ' @entity88 ' often appears in articles near the word ' @entity88 , ' which appears often near the phrases ' @entity93 ' and ' @entity92 , ' and so on , all the way to the word ' @entity84			1
' " as @entity98 of @entity99 says , this points out the limitations of relying so heavily on statistical reasoning			0
the result , as in @entity7 's case , is akin to a human autistic savant			1
" " @entity8 ! " is challenging because the clues are esoteric			2
no one would watch a battle of common sense			0
but @entity33 notes that a question like " if a snowman melts and later refreezes , does it turn back into a snowman ? " would be nearly impossible for a statistical reasoning program to tackle			0
you ca n't answer it by calculating how many times " snowman " appears next to " melt " and " refreeze " in every article and book ever written			0
not so hot now , are you @entity7 ? last week , i interviewed @entity119 , a journalist with unfettered access to @entity7 's development at @entity6			1
i asked him about people 's concern that computers with natural language capabilities could replace members of the work force			2
" people have good reason to worry about machines supplanting them , " @entity119 said			0
" that 's what technology does			0
tractors , forklifts , word - processing software , they all took away jobs			0
and people , with their creative minds , have used them throughout history to figure out where the next jobs will be			0
" and like its forebears , @entity7 's eventual commercial incarnation will be a tool , not a human replacement			1
@entity33 thinks of @entity7 or @entity149 or even the steam - powered hammer that bested @entity151 in @entity93 folklore as an " impressive demonstration that a certain task can , despite popular intuition at the time , be performed better by a machine			2
" @entity7 's natural language abilities might make it a good candidate for work in call centers , where it could interpret customers ' needs and direct them to the right information ( or people ) via conversation			1
there 's also been discussion of how @entity7 could be used in medicine to cross reference a patient 's symptoms with compendiums of digitized medical journals and data -- a sort of statistical second opinion to a doctor 's professional experience			1
but because @entity7 is only a " statistical brain , " and not an analytical one , do n't expect to see it managing your hr department or running a daycare facility anytime soon			2
we 'll still be getting up early and trudging off to do those jobs for the foreseeable future			0
thanks for nothing , @entity6			2
@entity191 is an editor at @entity192			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are his alone .			0

@entity6 's @entity7 computer does n't really " think " anything ; it struggles with simple questions
most of the clues on " @entity8 ! " mention proper nouns -- specific places , events , people
@entity7 's eventual commercial incarnation will be as a tool , not a human replacement
