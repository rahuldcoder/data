over a two - week period in 2000 , @entity1 played host at @entity6 to then - @entity8 prime minister @entity7 and @entity10 chairman @entity9			1
the summit ultimately ended without agreement			0
two @entity15 presidents later , the conflict rages on			0
now , @entity1 is less optimistic @entity3 negotiators will get that close again , telling @entity0 's @entity18 that peace between @entity8 and the @entity20 is impossible until @entity21 renounces violence			1

" " they wo n't do it so that 's a non-starter and i think it should be			2
you ca n't just have a one - way peace			0
both sides have got to give up what the other side most objects to			0
" there 's still hope for peace in the @entity3 @entity8 - @entity10 relations are at a low point			2

nevertheless , @entity1 said he 's not giving up hope for peace in the region			1
" we dance around the bush so many times and sooner or later someone will jump off the merry go round and do the right thing , " he said			0
" we got very close in 2000			0
" @entity1 was interviewed by @entity18 during stops on the former president 's eight - day tour of @entity63 , which included a visit to an @entity66 orphanage in @entity67 ahead of the @entity68 in @entity69			1
the conference opened sunday on a somber note -- at least six delegates traveling to the event were killed thursday when @entity74 17 exploded over eastern @entity75			1
@entity1 is scheduled to give a keynote address at the conference on wednesday			1
" they 're really , in a way , martyrs to the cause we are going to @entity88 to talk about , " @entity1 said of the researchers who died when unknown attackers shot their plane down over a rebel - controlled area of eastern @entity75			1
" thinking about those people being knocked out of the sky , it 's pretty tough			2
" on the crash of the @entity93 itself , @entity1 was careful not to draw immediate conclusions on who was responsible for the downing of the jet , which he called " sickening			1
" " we need to wait to make any definitive statements until we know exactly what happened , but it was sickening and i hope they will know and i hope they will know soon , " he said			2
since leaving office , @entity1 started the @entity1 hiv / aids initiative ( now called the @entity107 ) in an effort to get treatment to hiv / aids patients in the developing world			1

" i like it because it 's personal flesh and blood , " he says of his second career in public service through his foundation			2
" you 're not just talking in abstract policy terms			0
you actually see the lives of people change			0
... i loved my life in politics			0
but the difference now is i can see the personal human implications of the decisions we are making and i can work on , you know , how do we get the right policy ? how do we make it work ? and then you see the results			0
" @entity1 touched on a number of other issues in the wide - ranging interview , among them : aid for migrant children a good step president @entity149 's pitch to @entity150 for billions of dollars to handle the cases of tens of thousands of children from @entity153 who are illegally crossing the border is a step in the right direction , @entity1 said			1
" i hope that he will get this money he has asked for , because some of these kids may be eligible to stay under our laws because of the circumstances they face back home , " @entity1 said			1
" and we do n't want to deny the ones who are eligible the right to stay even as we send the other ones back			0
" since october , officials say more than 57,500 unaccompanied minors have been apprehended at the southwest @entity15 border			0
the @entity149 administration has labeled the situation a humanitarian crisis , and has asked for emergency funding to deal with it			0
" the system he has proposed to put in place , if he gets the money for it , will give all the ones who are n't immediately sent back ... quicker hearings , so if they are entitled to stay , they can stay , " @entity1 said			1
@entity75 wants independence , not war with @entity187 " the @entity75 do n't really want a hostile relationship with @entity187			1
... what they want is to be independent , " @entity1 said of the political conflict between @entity75 and @entity187			1
tensions have been high between @entity75 and @entity187 since street protests forced former @entity195 president @entity194 from power in february			1
@entity187 subsequently annexed @entity75 's southeastern @entity198 region , and a @entity200 separatist rebellion has been raging in @entity75 's eastern @entity202 and @entity203 regions			1
@entity75 wants " to be a bridge to @entity205 , between @entity205 and @entity187			1
and if done properly it would be good for @entity75 but also be very good for @entity187 and good for @entity205			1
so we have a clash there about what the @entity210 ought to be like			0
is it important for all of us to divide up and hide behind our walls ? or can we find a way to work together ? " @entity15 should help @entity215 , which needs to help itself " i would n't rule out the @entity15 doing more in @entity215 if the @entity215 do what 's necessary to help themselves , " @entity1 said of the worsening humanitarian situation in the country			1
the violent militant group @entity222 in @entity215 and @entity223 has taken over large swaths of land in @entity215 and aims to establish a hardline @entity227 state			0

and last november , @entity240 declared an air defense identification zone over the @entity253 , imposing air traffic restrictions over an area disputed with @entity256			0
@entity240 's moves have made other @entity259 countries nervous over its expanding military and more assertive foreign policy			2
and @entity1 says the @entity15 has a different take than @entity240 on how to solve the disputes			2
" one of the big differences is the @entity15 believes that we should have these issues involving natural resource claims in the south and east @entity240 seas resolved in a multinational forum where the small countries are not disadvantaged by being smaller than @entity240 , " @entity1 said			2
" and the @entity240 believe that all these things should be subject to what they call bilateral resolution , where the small countries believe they would n't have a chance trying to negotiate against @entity240 , just one country against the @entity240			0
" @entity0 's @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report			1
