-- " @entity5 " is a movie for anyone who thought that the pop melodrama of " @entity4 " was n't over-the - top enough			1
set in the late ' 60s , it tells the story of three sisters from middle - class @entity9 who form a girl group sort of like the @entity12			2
they 're astoundingly talented , they want to be famous , and at one point they get their shot at a major deal with @entity19			2
but all sorts of things keep getting in the way , like an abusive , coke - sniffing celebrity boyfriend — what happens to him will leave your jaw on the floor — and , more than that , their oppressively uptight church - lady mother , played with teasing confidence and force by @entity32 in her final screen role			1
the movie is a remake of the 1976 ersatz - @entity12 @entity37 fable that starred @entity38 , and the earlier film 's setting — the late ' 50s and early ' 60s — made sense			1
transplanting the material ahead nearly a decade , to the era of race riots and black power ( when the classic @entity48 sound was , in fact , already starting to fade ) , hurts the movie 's credibility , since it is now all the harder to believe that three feisty grown women are still living in their puritanical mother 's house because they 're too cowed to go out on their own			2
from its opening scene , set inside a hopping @entity9 nightclub , @entity5 is charged with a synthetically corny high tension			1
( @entity59 shows up in that scene , and does a fine job of playing a conk - haired funk - soul relic who loves the ladies , but then he completely vanishes from the movie			2
) the three sisters are each cut from a very different cloth			0
the quietly ambitious @entity5 , a brilliant songwriter , is played by the sixth - season @entity72 winner @entity71 , who proves to be a lot like @entity38 — that is , she 's pretty in a slightly pained way and wholesomely sincere to the point of being a bit boring			1
the whippersnapper @entity77 ( @entity78 ) mostly stays in the background , except when she explodes in moments of vengeful high dudgeon			0
and then there 's the sister known , literally , as @entity84 , who 's the star of the group and is played by the ravishingly sexy and accomplished @entity87 actress @entity86			0
in this role , she looks and acts strikingly like a demon - driven , down - and - dirty @entity90 , and her scenes with @entity92 , as her charismatic but hateful comedian lover , are the most potent in the film			2
the truth is that whenever @entity84 is on screen , we 're a little unsure why the movie is named after anyone else			0
sparkle uses some of the same imitation - @entity48 numbers by @entity102 that powered the 1976 version , along with new songs by @entity105			1
the music is all highly competent and , frankly , just unmemorable enough to make you wish that you were hearing authentic period chestnuts instead			2
the trouble with @entity5 is n't that it 's overwrought ( that 's what 's sometimes fun about it )			1
it 's that everything in the movie is derivative and third - hand : a copy of a copy			0
the film is pulp that 's been fed through a strainer , with bits and pieces squeezed out of a dozen other , better movies ( " what 's @entity125 " , " @entity126 , " and " dreamgirls , " to name just a few )			1
at times , it 's like a @entity131 neurotic - mother fantasy , and the gravelly conviction of @entity32 's performance proves that this could have been the first step not merely in a comeback but in a major re-invention			1
she had the instincts of a superb character actress			0
at other times , the movie is a girl - group biopic that never quite delivers the charge of success that we 're longing to see			0
@entity71 ' big , climactic on - stage number is supposed to do that , but to me it 's just a testament to the way that too many " idol " graduates , with their how - many - notes - can - i - cram - inside - a - note technical bravura , short - circuit any true connection with the audience			0
" @entity5 " is never more than an overheated mediocrity			1
the one thing it is n't , however , is dull			0
