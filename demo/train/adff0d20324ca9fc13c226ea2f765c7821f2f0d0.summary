-- after @entity3 's speech tuesday night , it will be very difficult for her critics to portray her as angry or aggrieved			1
she rarely raised her voice			2
she smiled , she charmed , she seemed to tear up			2
she said not an unkind thing about her political opponents			1
indeed , she never mentioned them			2
yet she eviscerated @entity9 and everything he represents by stunning contrast , by recounting her modest upbringing and reminding her audience that president @entity3 shared her unassuming roots			1
it was a bravura political performance cloaked in an apolitical narrative			0
after tuesday night , it will be very difficult for the @entity18 to accuse the first lady of being unpatriotic , of failing to sufficiently love @entity20			1
from her introduction by one of the nation 's military supermoms -- @entity25 , mother of four military officers -- @entity3 spoke of schoolteachers , of firefighters , of wounded warriors and their sacrifices			1
given @entity9 's failure in his convention speech to even acknowledge men and women in uniform , @entity3 's salute to them was another striking contrast , served up without venom or bile			1
from their first presidential campaign , @entity3 's role has been at least as difficult to navigate as her husband 's			1
as the first black woman to represent the country in a job with few defined duties but generations of cherished symbolism , she has had to endure relentless vicious attacks			0
she has been caricatured , as she has noted , as an " angry black woman			1
" she has been cast as hostile to whites			0
and her campaign against childhood obesity has earned cruel denunciations from the right , including a remark from an overweight @entity60 lawmaker that she has a " large posterior			0
" she has had to suffer through that privately , never shedding her calm exterior in public			0
she has had to shield her children from scrutiny and attempt to ensure they enjoy something close to normality			0
and she has had to carve out an official portfolio of suitable causes			0
but she has done all that with aplomb , racking up an enviable approval rating			0
if she was once a reluctant political wife , she seemed tuesday night to have found a way to enjoy her role			0
she was relaxed and confident			0
she was warm and approachable			0
( she was also lovely			0
that should n't matter , but it does			0
just ask any woman in the national political spotlight			0
) opinion : will @entity3 's speech change history ? she wove a narrative thread around her insecurities about how the pressures of life in the @entity88 might change her husband and her family			1
and she delivered a resounding assurance that the president remains not only loving and compassionate but also grounded in honesty and integrity			0
he can make the tough calls			1
" well , today , after so many struggles and triumphs and moments that have tested my husband in ways i never could have imagined , i have seen firsthand that being president does n't change who you are -- it reveals who you are			1
" in a speech full of great lines , that was my favorite			1
if @entity9 is a congenital flip - flopper whose views shift with the political winds , @entity3 's character has already been revealed , she noted without rancor or even explicit comparison			1
" and i 've seen how the issues that come across a president 's desk are always the hard ones -- the problems where no amount of data or numbers will get you to the right answer ... the judgment calls where the stakes are so high , and there is no margin for error , " she said			2
rarely have i heard a political speech that so deftly hit all the right notes and so stirringly found all the right chords			2
opinion : @entity3 has redefined black women she deftly deflected @entity60 accusations of class envy : " our families were n't asking for much			1
they did n't begrudge anyone else 's success or care that others had much more than they did			2
... in fact , they admired it			0
" but she also noted that @entity147 do n't believe in @entity149 's hyperindividualism			2
" we learned about gratitude and humility -- that so many people had a hand in our success , from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean ... and we were taught to value everyone 's contribution and treat everyone with respect			2
" this was red meat served up in a bed of lovely salad greens from @entity3 's garden			1
who could argue that was n't a fitting entree from a first lady ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			1

@entity174 : it would be tough for critics to paint @entity3 as angry , aggrieved
she says @entity3 's @entity180 speech was not unkind , yet eviscerated @entity9 *candidacy*
@entity183 : @entity3 saluted military , told of humble roots , shared concerns with other @entity20
she made case for her husband , drew contrasts with @entity9 without venom , @entity183 says
