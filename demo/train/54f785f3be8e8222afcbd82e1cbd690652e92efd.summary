-- @entity1 reported problems controlling the undersea well at the heart of the largest oil spill in @entity7 history and won a delay in testing a critical piece of equipment in march , according to documents released sunday			1
" we are in the midst of a well control situation on @entity15 # 001 and have stuck pipe			0
we are bringing out equipment to begin operations to sever the drillpipe , plugback the well and bypass , " @entity17 , a @entity1 regulatory advisor , told the district engineer for the @entity7 @entity21 's @entity20 in a march 10 e-mail			2
in a follow - up e-mail to the district engineer , @entity29 , @entity17 reported the company wanted to get a plug set in the well before testing the blowout preventer , the massive device used to shut down the well in case of an emergency			1
" with the give and take of the well and hole behavior we would feel much more comfortable getting at least one of the two plugs set in order to fully secure the well prior to testing @entity42 , " she wrote			0
when @entity29 told @entity1 he could not delay a test any longer than it took to bring the well under control , the company won a postponement from @entity50 , the @entity20 district manager in @entity51 , @entity52 , the documents show			1
@entity50 ordered @entity1 to make sure its cement plug was set up and to verify its placement , according to his reply			2
the messages do not indicate how long the test was postponed			0
the exchange was among the documents released sunday by leaders of the @entity62 , which is looking into the disaster that killed 11 workers aboard the drilling platform @entity66 and uncapped a gusher that is now fouling the northern @entity68			0
@entity1 has been unable to activate the well 's blowout preventer since the explosion , resulting in up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) spewing into the @entity68 every day			1
appearing on @entity74 's " @entity73 , " @entity1 managing director @entity72 said those questions are being addressed by an investigation led by the @entity77 and the @entity20 , which oversees offshore oil drilling			1
@entity1 , rig owner @entity80 and oilfield services company @entity79 have blamed each other for the disaster " there were issues of well control , signs out there , and there are strict procedures that are written , " @entity72 said			1
those procedures allow the rig owner " to walk through well control , " he said			0
" that 's what the investigation will take minute by minute , " he said			0
but he said the failure of the well 's blowout preventer is a " very troubling " issue that will have repercussions throughout the oil industry			1
" it is the piece of equipment that is not expected to fail , and that 's going to have implications for everyone around the world , " @entity72 said			0
@entity1 's design of the well has also come under scrutiny in the @entity51 hearings held by @entity20 and the @entity77			2
@entity1 drilling engineer @entity110 testified friday that he made " several changes to the casing designs " to address problems with the well 's cement walls and leaking drilling fluid			1
but he said the problems had been addressed			0
" no one believed there was going to be a safety issue with pumping that cement job , " he said			0
@entity79 performed the cementing work on the well , and @entity79 worker @entity124 told the @entity51 hearings friday that @entity1 kept changing the dimensions of the well 's casing			2
meanwhile , @entity1 's investigation " raised concerns about the maintenance history , modification , inspection , and testing " of the blowout preventer , committee chairman @entity129 , @entity130 , reported earlier this month			1
the @entity138 reported sunday that @entity1 documents indicated the company had " serious problems and safety concerns " with the rig 's well casing and blowout preventer for months			1
rep. @entity146 , a @entity148 @entity147 who leads an @entity150 subcommittee , said he has seen documents that confirm the @entity138 report			0
other witnesses at congressional hearings into the spill have raised concerns as well			0
@entity157 , a laborer on the doomed rig , told the @entity159 last week that the @entity80 crew had to stop drilling four times in the space of 20 days because of the loss of drilling " mud " -- " either because the underground formation was unstable , or because drilling too quickly caused the formation to crack , " he said			2
and @entity167 , the rig 's chief mechanic , told the @entity159 that cuts to @entity66 's engineering staff left the crew with a backlog of preventive maintenance to perform			1
when they complained , he said , " we were always told , ' we will see what we can do			0

@entity1 won delay in blowout preventer test
@entity1 director says issues under investigation
hearings raise questions about well casing , cement
rig cuts caused maintenance backlog , mechanic says
