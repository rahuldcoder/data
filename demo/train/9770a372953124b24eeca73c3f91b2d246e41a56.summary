-- call it what you will -- providence , fate or simply a stroke of incredibly good luck -- @entity9 shooting victim @entity8 has some of it			1
@entity11 , 22 , sustained multiple gunshot wounds in the movie theater rampage last week			1
three shotgun pellets hit her arm , and one went through her nose into her brain			1
the head injury could have been fatal , but thanks in part to a brain abnormality she never knew she had , @entity11 is on her way to a full recovery , according to her pastor			1
he said there 's just one way to describe what happened : " a miracle			2
" remembering the victims " the doctor explains that @entity34 's brain has had from birth a small ' defect ' in it			1
it is a tiny channel of fluid running through her skull , like a tiny vein through marble , or a small hole in an oak board , winding from front to rear , " @entity37 , senior pastor at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity9 , wrote on his blog this week			1
" like a marble through a small tube , the defect channels the bullet from @entity34 's nose through her brain			1
it turns slightly several times , and comes to rest at the rear of her brain			1
and in the process , the bullet misses all the vital areas of the brain			1
in many ways , it almost misses the brain itself , " he said			2
" in @entity71 we call it prevenient grace : @entity74 working ahead of time for a particular event in the future			1
it 's just like the @entity74 i follow to plan the route of a bullet through a brain long before @entity83 ever rises			2
twenty - two years before , " @entity37 wrote			2
@entity11 was one of 58 people wounded when a gunman opened fire early friday inside a screening of the new @entity83 movie , " @entity89 , " at a theater in @entity91 , @entity9			1
gun background checks in @entity9 spike after shooting @entity96 , a friend of @entity11 's family , stopped short of describing the condition as a defect			1
as a neurosurgeon explained to the family , channels or " voids " like hers are not uncommon , but the placement of them is random and can vary , he said			2
the 22 - year - old was moved out of the intensive care unit monday			2
she has started physical and speech therapy and is able to walk , talk and laugh , according to @entity96			0
" she 's herself in a lot of ways , " he said			0
@entity11 is a gifted musician and composer			0
she spent last summer studying composition at the @entity116 and is an alumna of the prestigious @entity119 camp			0
stories of survival from the victims she also studied music composition at the @entity124 , @entity125 , and was named the 2011 @entity126 , a national award for outstanding music students			0
@entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity129 , who is a neurosurgeon , recalled a case where someone had what looked to be a significant bullet injury to the brain , but the person also had an arachnoid cyst , or a fluid - filled sac			1
that condition likely saved the patient 's life and may have been what happened with @entity11 , @entity129 said			0
but , he added , there are several conditions that could help explain her case			0
@entity11 's pastor , @entity37 , described a moment at the hospital when @entity11 woke up			2
she opened her eyes , sat up and asked for her mom , he wrote			0
surviving with the guilt of living @entity11 's mother , @entity153 , is also sick			0
she found out recently that the breast cancer she thought was gone is back and has spread to her liver , bones and lungs , according to a website set up to help raise funds for their family			0
@entity11 is not completely out of the woods either			0
she needs more surgeries and could , perhaps , undergo facial reconstruction			0
still , for now , family members are thankful for the support they have received so far and focused on the moment			0
" we are all in amazement at what happened , " said @entity96 , the family friend			0
" the family is approaching this entire experience with an attitude of gratitude toward the community that has risen up in support of @entity34			0
" court appearance fuels theories about @entity9 shooting suspect			1
