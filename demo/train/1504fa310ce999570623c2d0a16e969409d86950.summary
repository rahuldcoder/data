@entity1 protests swelled wednesday to their largest numbers yet , after local unions pledged support to a third week of demonstrations against income inequality , corporate greed , corruption and a list of other social ills			1
thousands meandered from lower @entity13 's @entity12 -- considered a rallying point for the largely leaderless group -- to @entity16 near @entity17			1
the crowd then looped back to the park , punctuating a 19 - day protest that promotes a wide , if not ambiguous , range of messages			2
causes range from social awareness to radical change in @entity28 's financial and political systems , while other participants appeared content to simply get caught up in the spirit of demonstration			1
still , while the fledgling movement has struggled in its definition , demonstrators appear steadfast in their general criticism of the country 's wealthiest 1 % and its purported influence			1
some carried placards and shouted slogans denouncing corporate excess , while others said they were " fed up " with high unemployment and a lack of economic opportunity			2
still others said they had simply been waiting for a moment to express their voice and kick - start a conversation about inequality			2
the crowd stretched along a dozen city blocks , chanting " all day , all week , occupy @entity1			2
" the protestors also have begun printing a newspaper called the @entity56 @entity55 in an effort to garner an additional media attention			1
and following a string of arrests , they say they are pursuing a class action lawsuit against the @entity62 and mayor @entity63 for their " unconstitutional effort to disrupt and suppress " demonstrations			1
the group seemed to gain momentum after a september 24 pepper spray incident involving protestors and @entity71 police officers			1
on october 1 , police arrested hundreds of protestors as they marched across a roadway leading to the @entity74 , blocking city traffic for hours			0
meanwhile , social media sites such as @entity77 seem to be spurring similar protests in other cities , though in vastly smaller numbers			1
dozens gathered in @entity82 ; @entity83 , @entity84 ; and @entity85 , while demonstrations were also scheduled later wednesday in @entity87 , @entity88 , among other cities			1
demonstrations were also expected to take place in @entity91 , and @entity92 , @entity93 , on thursday			1
a @entity77 account called @entity95 mentions a citywide college walkout there later wednesday			1
elsewhere , the @entity98 said hundreds of the city 's nurses would rally with the @entity95 protesters later wednesday			1
the association said the protest would be part of the opening day activities for a national nursing convention in @entity82			0
@entity107 : send us your photos , videos in @entity71 , several unions endorsed the @entity1 movement and planned to join the protesters ' street theater wednesday , labor leaders said			1
the voices of @entity118 " it 's really simple			2
these young people on @entity1 are giving voice to many of the problems that working people in @entity28 have been confronting over the last several years , " said @entity120 , international president of the @entity121 , which has 20,000 members in the @entity71 area			0
" these young people are speaking for the vast majority of @entity28 who are frustrated by the bankers and brokers who have profited on the backs of hard - working people , " @entity120 added in a statement			0
" while we battle it out day after day , month after month , the millionaires and billionaires on @entity1 sit by -- untouched -- and lecture us on the level of our sacrifice			0
" @entity144 local 100 spokesman @entity143 said the @entity1 movement , which denounces social inequities in the financial system and draws inspiration from the @entity150 revolutions in @entity151 and the @entity152 , has advanced issues that unions typically support			0
" their goals are our goals , " @entity143 said			0
" they brought a spotlight on issues that we 've believed in for quite some time now			0
... @entity1 caused the implosion in the first place and is getting away scot - free while workers , transit workers , everybody , is forced to pay for their excesses			0
" these young folks have brought a pretty bright spotlight , " @entity143 added			0
" it 's kind of a natural alliance			2
" @entity171 : ' @entity172 ' occupy @entity1 president @entity173 of the @entity174 , the sole bargaining agent for most nonsupervisory @entity71 public teachers , with 200,000 members , said he was proud to support the demonstrators			0
" the way our society is now headed , it does not work for 99 % of people , so when @entity1 started ... they kept to it and they 've been able to create a national conversation that we think should have been going on for years , " @entity173 said			0
the labor officials could n't provide a projection of how many of their members will take the day off from work wednesday and join the protests			1
view a high - resolution gallery of the protests in @entity71 , the demonstrators have camped out in @entity12 , calling for 20,000 people to flood the area for a " few months			1
" the protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag # occupywallstreet on the microblogging site @entity77 -- began in july with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and sit - in at the @entity204			1
and for more than two weeks , demonstrations have addressed issues such as police brutality , union busting and the economy , the group said			1
@entity211 : occupy @entity1 protests occupy @entity1 is a leaderless movement made up largely of twenty - somethings upset about the economy , the @entity217 war , the environment , and the state of @entity28 and the world in general			2
in less than three weeks , the movement has become a magnet for countless disaffected americans at a time when an overwhelming majority of @entity28 adults say the country is on the wrong track			0
@entity1 protesters inspired by @entity150 movement besides the other cities , protests have also been held in @entity233 and @entity234			1
@entity1 and its offshoots have clear strains of liberal economic populism -- a powerful force in @entity28 history during times characterized by economic stress			0
that said , it would be a mistake to label or tie the movement to a specific agenda , said @entity247 , a @entity248 sociology professor			0
" it 's difficult to classify a social protest movement early on in its history , " she said			2
" clearer goals could eventually emerge , but there 's no guarantee			2
" she added , " many movements fizzle out			0
( but ) i think we run a risk ( by ) taking a snapshot at any one point in time and trying to categorize the movement in any one way based on that snapshot			0
the only way to study these protest movements is to follow them over time			0

wednesday 's protests have the largest numbers since demonstrations began
the group is printing a newspaper called the @entity56 @entity55
they say they are pursuing a lawsuit against mayor @entity63 and @entity62
