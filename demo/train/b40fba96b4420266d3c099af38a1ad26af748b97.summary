-- the deaths of more than 70 football fans shortly after a match between @entity4 's @entity3 club and the @entity6 club in @entity7 , @entity8 , shocked the world			1
more than 1,000 more were injured in scenes that will leave an indelible mark on post-revolution @entity8 -- because in @entity8 soccer matters perhaps more than anywhere			0
passions have always run high in @entity8 football			0
the @entity4 derby between @entity3 and their rivals @entity21 is the biggest football match in @entity23 , and has to be held at a neutral venue , usually with a neutral foreign referee , to combat a history of enmity and violence			1
@entity8 in mourning as death toll rises in 2009 , a @entity32 qualifier between @entity8 and @entity33 sparked riots in @entity4 , @entity35 and beyond			1
but domestic football has also been on the frontline during the revolution that toppled former president @entity39 last year			2
for the past five years , highly organized and anti-authoritarian fan groups of " ultras , " especially from @entity3 and @entity21 , have been in conflict with the police at football grounds , objecting to the heavy handed treatment meted out to them by @entity39 's forces			1

although other people -- and many within @entity8 's ruling @entity94 [ @entity94 ] -- view the ultras as the problem			1
@entity97 in that context , the deaths of 79 fans -- most if not all hailing from @entity3 -- at a football match will leave many within @entity8 questioning how and why this has happened as the police watched on			1
