@entity0 -- in 2004 , even after being captured by @entity4 forces , @entity2 told an @entity6 interrogator he believed @entity7 was a greater threat to @entity9 than the @entity4 , according to newly released @entity6 documents			1
@entity13 's @entity12 newspaper shows @entity2 , right , with @entity14 of @entity9 's governing council in 2003			1
the @entity6 interviews took place while @entity2 , then identified by the @entity6 as " @entity18 " was held captive by @entity4 military forces at @entity20 between february and june of 2004			1
@entity2 regarded the @entity7 threat as so serious that it was the major factor in his decision not to allow @entity24 weapons inspectors to return , he said			1
citing their shared border and his belief @entity7 would intend to annex southern @entity9 , @entity2 said he was more concerned about @entity7 discovering @entity9 's weaknesses than repercussions from the @entity4 and the international community			1
he believed that the inspectors would have directly identified to the @entity7 where to inflict maximum damage to @entity9			1
approximately 100 pages of declassified interview summaries , previously classified as secret , were obtained by the @entity37 at the @entity38 through a @entity40 request			0
the @entity6 declined @entity1 's request to interview special agent @entity42 , the agent who interviewed @entity2			2
@entity6 spokesman @entity43 declined to comment on the declassified documents			0
" as a general rule , the @entity6 does not discuss @entity40 'd documents			0
we let the information stand on its own , " @entity43 told @entity1			0
@entity42 , an @entity6 agent fluent in @entity49 , conducted the interviews along with another agent whose name has been redacted from the documents			0
although @entity2 had been a prisoner for months , at one point during an interview he said , " i am not the ex-president of @entity9			2
i am still the president of @entity9			2
" @entity2 also described @entity58 leader @entity57 as a " zealot " and said he had never met or seen him			1
he also said the @entity4 used the september 11 attacks as justification to attack @entity9 , and that the @entity4 had " lost sight of the cause			1
" despite @entity42 citing evidence of @entity9 's contacts with @entity58 , @entity2 said , " the @entity9 government did not cooperate with @entity57 " and that the two " did not have the same belief or vision			1
" the former regime 's alleged weapons of mass destruction and alleged ties to @entity58 were the @entity75 administration 's primary justifications for invading @entity9 in march of 2003			2
@entity42 and @entity2 spoke extensively about @entity9 's chemical weapons during the @entity7 war , the 1990 invasion of @entity79 and in the years before the second @entity4 invasion			1
@entity2 refused to answer a question about whether @entity9 would have lost the war it fought with @entity7 from 1980 to 1988 if it had not used chemical weapons			1
he also said neither he nor any other @entity9 officials discussed using chemical weapons during the first @entity84			2
@entity2 admitted that @entity9 made a mistake by destroying some weapons without @entity24 supervision			1
in his view , the inspectors wanted all of their expenses paid for by @entity9			2
instead of waiting for the inspectors and paying the expenses , @entity9 began destroying the weapons			2
we told you , with documents			0
that 's it , " @entity2 said			2
when asked about restrictions he placed on weapons inspectors regarding which locations they could visit , @entity2 responded , " by @entity105 , if i had such weapons , i would have used them in the fight against the @entity4			1
" @entity2 commented about the mental state of @entity4 soldiers occupying @entity9			1
" if you asked the @entity4 soldier -- who came to @entity9 to find weapons of mass destruction , but none could be found , and who came to remove the leaders of the @entity2 dictatorship , who are all in jail now , but are replaced with other dictators -- whether he wanted to stay or go , he would say go			1
" @entity2 said he alone gave the orders to fire scud missiles at @entity121 during the first @entity84 , adding , " everything that happened to us was because of @entity121			0
" he said he figured that the @entity4 would stop the war if @entity121 was " hurt , " and he wanted to punish the country he viewed as the source of all his problems			0
@entity2 recalled a meeting in @entity129 between his foreign minister @entity130 and then - @entity4 secretary of state @entity131 in january of 1991 shortly before @entity84			2
according to @entity2 , @entity131 offered no solutions to resolve the @entity79 situation and gave specific steps to @entity130 that the @entity4 wanted @entity9 to do first , and @entity131 added " otherwise , we 'll take you back to the pre-industrial age			1
" he also told @entity42 he wanted to have a relationship with the @entity4 but was not given the opportunity because in his view the @entity4 was not listening to anything @entity9 had to say			2
@entity2 also revealed details about his security measures and movements before and after the second @entity4 invasion of @entity9 in march of 2003			1
he says he had only used a telephone on two occasions since march of 1990			0
he denied ever using body doubles , claiming , " this is movie magic , not reality			0
" he also said he never saw his sons use body doubles			0
" do not think i am getting upset when you mention my sons			0
i still think about them and the fact that they were martyred			0
they will be examples to everyone throughout the world , " he said			0
@entity2 also states he was not in the @entity162 neighborhood of @entity13 on march 19 , 2003 , when it was bombed by coalition forces in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him			0
he says he remained in @entity13 until april 10 or 11 of 2003 , when it appeared the city was about to fall to coalition forces			0
before leaving the city , he said he held one final meeting with the senior @entity9 leadership and told them , " we will struggle in secret			0
" shortly after his departure from the capital , @entity2 began to gradually disperse his bodyguards , telling them they had completed their duty , so as not to draw attention			0
@entity2 also admitted that after participating in the failed assassination attempt against then - @entity9 president gen. @entity181 in 1959 , he had stayed at the same farm where he was captured by @entity4 forces in december of 2003			1
