we journalists tend to think of ourselves as public servants , but we sure do n't act like it all the time			2
the institution has one foot firmly planted in elitism : editors know what you need to know before you know you need to know it			0
it would be foolish to think that -- gasp ! -- the public could help decide what matters			0
but things do n't have to be that way , right ? we 're better people when we work together			0
it 's in a spirit of democracy and inclusion that i 'm asking you to vote on the stories i should cover over the course of the next 12 months for a new @entity28 project called @entity29			1
it 's not that i do n't have ideas about what i 'd like to do , or that the views of professional journalists do n't matter			1
it 's that i also trust your judgment and i want to write about issues you find important			1
vote here : you pick it , @entity28 covers it i also want you to participate in every part of the storytelling			1
with help from lots of smart people , i 've selected 20 story ideas i think are worthy of your attention			1
each highlights an extreme case : the country with the least access to toilets ; the state with the highest incarceration rate ; the nation where malaria is deadliest ; the place where 1 in 100 live births kills the mother ; the country where the largest number of new leprosy cases is diagnosed each year ; the one country that ranks below @entity66 on free speech			1
the goal , as the name change the list suggests , is to start a conversation that could -- just maybe , and over time -- bump these places off the bottom of the list			1
it 's a project that supports the world 's underdogs			1
the aim is n't to shame the places at the bottom of the list ; it 's to give them a megaphone and support			1
go to the @entity85 homepage -- http://cnn.com/changethelist -- to pick your top five stories from the list of 20 before voting closes on monday , june 17			1
think of this as your chance to be a @entity28 assignment editor			1
you 're my boss , in fact			0
( dear people who pay me : please keep doing that ? ) and as my new ( and hopefully benevolent ) internet - based overlord , you have every right to tell me these 20 ideas are junk			1
instead of firing me , i 'd ask that you send me an e-mail ( ctl@cnn.com ) or a note on @entity103 ( @ jdsutter ) with an idea for a story you think is more important or interesting			0
we 're going to include a sixth wild - card choice in the coverage plan -- and , while @entity28 's editors will have the final say , that idea could come from you			1
since i hope you 'll take me on as an employee , i should probably tell you a little bit about myself			0
i 've been at @entity28 for more than four years now , covering all sorts of topics , from video gaming in @entity116 to prisons in @entity118 and slavery in @entity120			1
if there 's one thing this place has taught me it 's that stories are more powerful , memorable and meaningful when you participate in them			1
i saw this last month when strangers on @entity103 helped me navigate a somewhat treacherous walk through the 17 - mile path of an @entity131 tornado			0
i was n't alone on that two - day trek			0
i was on a journey with dozens of new friends			0
" @ jdsutter maybe i should tweet you a picture of the bottom of my foot as an example of why tetanus shots are important ? " and i saw it after dozens of @entity142 sent in " messages of hope " to former and escaped slaves in @entity120 , which i visited in 2011			0
support videos came from all over : from @entity147 to @entity116 , @entity148 to @entity149			0
" i want you to know that all of us are so proud of you ... , " one woman said to the group of former slaves , who were taking classes in @entity120 's capital			2
and i saw it last year when a videographer , @entity158 , and i did the pilot for @entity29			0
we featured @entity161 , the @entity162 state with the lowest voter turnout rate			0
less than half of @entity161 's residents voted in the 2008 presidential election			2
we were n't able to change that in one month , of course , but we did get people talking			2
@entity161 tied @entity170 for 49th place in voter turnout in the november 2012 election			0
and , more meaningfully for me , three of the six nonvoters we featured as part of a story called " convince me to vote ! " ended up voting because of messages @entity28 's readers sent to them via social media			1
" i feel good about it , " one man said of his decision to vote for the first time			2
it 's journalism with an agenda			2
i 'm not ashamed of that			0
the main agenda is for your voice to be heard -- and for us to work together to amplify the voices of people that are n't often heard in the news			0
and it starts with a vote			2
so tell me , boss			0
what should we cover ?			2
