@entity0 -- it was a photo shoot that caught @entity4 's attention			1
five courageous survivors of acid attacks posed for portraits			1
in a country where victims of such attacks do not dare to come out of hiding , or show their disfigured faces in public , this was a " ground breaking " photo shoot , participants said			1
" after the acid attack i never took photos , " @entity17 , one of the models and a survivor said			1
" when the photos got circulated in the media , people started calling to inquire about me , i felt so good			0
after the photo shoot i want to go out meet more people			1
" @entity17 , now 22 , was 15 years old when she was attacked by her stepmother following a dispute about money			2
" that night , after acid was poured on my face , i could not see anything			0
i could not open my eyes , i was screaming , " she said			0
" but no one came to help me			0
my stepmother watched me suffering			0
" after that night , everything changed			0
" my studies stopped , i stopped playing			0
" it was only three years after the acid attack that @entity17 gathered enough courage to look at her face in the mirror			1
it was her childhood dream , to be a designer and @entity17 designed the outfits for all the models featured on the photo shoot including herself			1
the photos were first published on facebook page run by @entity51 , an organization raising awareness about the plight of acid attack victims but have since been featured extensively across the world			1
her next step is to open a boutique			0
currently she is living in @entity58 , a rehabilitation center for acid attack victims opened by the charity			1
new law in 2013 , the @entity63 passed laws aiming to control over-the - counter sales of acid			2
but the implementation has been poor though , said @entity68 , founder of @entity51			0
" yes , the law is on paper , but you can find acid easily in local markets , " he said			2
" we need the government to be active in enforcing the law to regulate acid sales			2
" according to the group , more than 200 acid attack cases have been reported since january 2013			1
but activists including @entity68 believe the real number is much higher			0
lacking support from family and society , many victims do not report attacks to the police			2
fearing social stigma , many do not even show their face in public			0
and that is what the group wanted the photo shoot to change			1
" we want the acid attack survivors to come out of hiding and tell their stories			1
it is okay to show your face , " @entity68 said			0
changing perceptions @entity103 , a professional photographer , was the man behind the camera			2
he wanted to showcase @entity17 's designs and help her motivate other fellow acid attack survivors across the world			1
his second goal : make the victims feel beautiful and change the way people define " beauty " in general			2
" in our society , there are lots of things said to the girls -- you are not beautiful , you wo n't get married because your skin is not white and fair , " @entity103 said			0
" i want to change the perception of beauty -- tell people that the real beauty is not about having a fair skin			2
" when you see pictures used in commercials , you just see and forget them after sometime , but when you see these pictures , you feel in love with them			0
you want to look at them again and again			0
" @entity133 , another acid attack victim and a participant of the photo shoot , was 17 when acid was thrown at her face			1
she is 19 now and going through treatment			0
she can not see with her left eye			0
" every acid attack survivor says they do not want to meet the attackers , " she said			1
" but i want to meet the guy ( who did this to me ) and ask : ' was it worth it ? ' " actress critical after acid attack @entity4 acid attack victim fights for justice @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			1
