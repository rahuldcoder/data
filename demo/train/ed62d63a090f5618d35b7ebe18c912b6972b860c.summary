-- it 's season 17 and i for one am still feeling aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive ! sort of			1
that 's a lot of i 's			2
the @entity6 cast wo n't be announced ' til wednesday morning on @entity7 ( look for the complete list on @entity0 's @entity9 ) , but of course the rumors are spinning faster than @entity13 's sparkly bolero in a shirtless @entity15 tango			2
@entity16 will not confirm any casting rumors , but as usual , @entity18 has been busy reporting on them anyway			2
so who 's supposedly on board ? @entity22 would probably be the biggest story , as the star of @entity25 and the @entity26 had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in january			1
doctors say she may be nearing remission , but the idea of " dancing for your life " would be a huge deal			0
i 'd trust @entity36 to make her journey a celebration of life rather than a looming cloud of doom â € ” but when contestants regularly drop out due to injury and suffer near - breakdowns due to emotional exhaustion , you have to wonder ... is this wise ? i 'd personally be most excited to see former @entity48 stars @entity49 ( @entity50 ) and @entity51 reunite on network tv			1
i 've already started searching for evidence of dramatic struggles between @entity55 and @entity56 , but you 'd be surprised how little footage there is on @entity60 of the @entity61 summer			0
( no , you would n't			0
) @entity49 recently broke away from the @entity62 and should be eager to latch what will become a lifelong devotion to the @entity65 â € ” which lasts 24 - 7 and is year - round if you really want to commit and have the right mentality about it			1
i 've started coming up with a collection of @entity71 moves @entity51 should do on @entity6 ... and i 'm wondering if that famous shot of her licking the stripper pole would work best for the rumba or the marathon mambo			0
it 's going really well so far			0
also rumored for season 17 : @entity79 's @entity78 , @entity81 star @entity80 , @entity82 , @entity83 , mother to us all , and a " yogurt spokesperson " â € ” i 'm hoping @entity87 but maybe dwts super fan ( and former @entity90 supporter ) @entity93 a.k.a. @entity91 ( @entity94 ) is more likely ? again , none of this is official			1
but what do you think , so far ? i honestly never put much stock in @entity36 casting because surprise dance ability and the camaraderie established a few weeks down the line are what will ultimately keep people tuning in			0
still , this cast is pretty great , right ? @entity49 vs. @entity51 for the win ? see the original story at @entity0			1
