-- " our country has changed , " wrote chief justice @entity1 on june 25 , 2013 , when five of the nine @entity4 justices dismantled the historic @entity5			2
@entity1 is correct in at least one respect : today 's @entity8 is no longer the party of @entity9 , as former @entity4 @entity10 reminded us again in a recent article in the @entity13			1
@entity10 , a lifelong @entity8 appointed to the court by @entity15 , attacked @entity1 and his @entity8 colleagues for usurping the authority of @entity18 which had overwhelmingly renewed the act in 2006			1
but 48 years ago this week , the @entity8 supported the cause of voting rights			1
on august 6 , 1965 , when president @entity23 signed the @entity5 into law , he gave the second pen he used to @entity26 , the @entity26 senate minority leader			1
@entity26 deserved the honor because he was a major architect of the act			1
in fact , the bill was written in @entity26 's office as he sat next to acting attorney general @entity32			2
later , insiders joked that the bill should be called " @entity34			0
" although suffering from emphysema , ulcers and an enlarged heart , @entity26 worked hard defending the bill on the floor of the @entity40 , successfully defeating @entity42 efforts to weaken it			0
@entity23 feared that a @entity42 filibuster would delay the bill until the @entity40 adjourned for the summer , a dangerous prospect			0
" they been doin ' that for 35 years that i been here , " @entity23 fumed , " and i been watchin ' ' em do it			0
" opinion : 50 years later , civil rights struggle is far from over @entity23 turned to @entity26 for help			2
the senator from @entity54 persuaded 23 fellow @entity8 to vote for cloture , shutting off a filibuster and freeing the @entity5 for an up or down vote			1
when it came , 30 @entity8 joined 47 @entity59 to pass the bill and send it to the @entity61 for their consideration			1
after @entity42 efforts to destroy the bill in the @entity61 were defeated and differences between @entity61 and @entity40 versions of the bill were resolved in conference committee , the @entity5 was passed overwhelmingly by both houses of @entity18 that august , with @entity8 support			1
soon , however , republicans began to court white voters in the @entity42 and elsewhere who were alienated by the @entity59 's embrace of civil rights			1
@entity73 first adopted this " @entity42 strategy " in his 1968 presidential campaign , following the advice of @entity76 , a political advisor , who later noted that " the more negroes who register as @entity59 in the @entity42 , the sooner the @entity79 whites will quit the @entity59 and become @entity8			1
" and so it came to be : blacks , who were affiliated with @entity9 's @entity8 party after the @entity86 and well into the 20th century , moved decisively to join the party of @entity23 , and later @entity88 , and @entity91 , while the @entity8 moved sharply to the right and came to mostly represent white @entity90			1
in 2010 , after winning control of 25 state legislatures , @entity8 enacted a series of laws designed to suppress the votes of those who elected @entity91 president in 2008			2
then , on june 25 , 2013 , the conservative majority on the @entity4 bid a final farewell to the party of @entity9 by demolishing the @entity5 in @entity102			1
troubled by this development , @entity10 , a @entity8 appointed to the court in 1975 by president @entity15 , offered his dissent in the @entity13 article			2
@entity10 felt strongly that the court had erred in taking the case , since @entity18 had thoroughly investigated and found evidence of racial discrimination in voting in 2006 , resulting in the act 's near - unanimous reauthorization that same year			2
he argued that the chief justice 's opinion had failed " to explain why such a decision should be made by the members of the @entity4 , " and not the @entity18			0
after all , the @entity117 to the @entity118 , which prohibits interference with voting on the basis of race , color , and condition of previous servitude , clearly gives the @entity18 the right to pass legislation to enforce that amendment			0
" the members of @entity18 , representing the millions of voters who elected them , are far more likely to evaluate correctly the ... issue ... , " @entity10 concluded			0
conservatives on the court were guilty of the judicial activism they had long decried			0
veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost in a final ironic twist , @entity10 quoted @entity141 's dissent in the @entity143 case , which @entity10 thought applied at least as well , if not better , to what the court had done in @entity102 : " we have no power to decide this case			0
and even if we did , we have no power under the @entity118 to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation			0
the court 's errors on both points spring forth from the same diseased root : an exalted conception of the role of this institution in @entity90			0
" @entity10 ' dissent , coming as it does from the man who served longer than any other @entity8 appointee on the @entity4 , testifies to how far that party has strayed from its origins			1
with the gutting of the @entity5 , republicans throughout the @entity42 are again passing voter suppression laws ( and , in @entity165 , legislation which would damage women 's reproductive rights )			1
it is no longer the party of @entity9 or @entity171			2
it has become the party of @entity174			0
whether the @entity90 people wish to turn the clock back to 1861 remains to be seen			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

@entity179 : *roberts* court gutting @entity5 , *recalls* that @entity8 no longer party of @entity9
he says leading @entity8 in 1965 , @entity26 , was architect of act , rounding up @entity8 votes
later , @entity8 " @entity191 " wooed white voters , blacks *flocked* to @entity59
may : now court has *abetted* @entity8 , as it tries to *obstruct* voting rights in states
