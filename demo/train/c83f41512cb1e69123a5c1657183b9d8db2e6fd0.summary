would have commanded international news headlines and extensive press coverage over the past 12 years			2
the @entity13 has labeled the @entity3 , @entity30 's second largest country , as the " rape capital of the world " because of the pace and scope of the use of rape as a weapon of war by proxy militia gangs fighting for control of @entity3 's easily appropriable and highly valuable natural resources , destined for sale in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29			0
the wars in that country have claimed nearly the same number of lives as having a 9/11 every single day for 360 days , the genocide that struck @entity38 in 1994 , the ethnic cleansing that overwhelmed @entity40 in the mid- 1990s , the genocide that took place in @entity43 , the number of people killed in the great tsunami that struck @entity27 in 2004 , and the number of people who died in @entity48 -- all combined and then doubled			0
yet we rarely hear anything about it			0
indeed , one only need contrast media coverage of the latest @entity54 airstrikes on the @entity55 and @entity57 rocket attacks into southern @entity54 , which have made front pages around the world , to the stunningly limited media coverage afforded to graphic accounts of atrocities committed that same week by @entity63 , the newest militia gang terrorizing the local population			1
desperate families flee @entity3 the same trend has been observed in the extensive coverage of the on - going , fast - moving and difficult - to - report civil war in @entity69 , which has claimed nearly 40,000 lives			1
@entity63 's murderous campaigns to besiege @entity3 's eastern mineral - rich provinces of @entity73 have left over 200,000 people in terrible conditions , killed countless and ushered in a dire humanitarian transgression			2
the @entity38 government has been accused by the @entity13 of backing @entity63 by providing it with arms , support and soldiers , but @entity38 's president , @entity81 , has denied the allegation			0
the question here is not whether the human suffering in @entity3 deserves more media coverage because it is greater than that in @entity69 or @entity55 , but rather , why has the crisis in @entity69 or @entity55 qualified for extensive media coverage , but not the killing and raping industries in @entity3 ? i doubt that this is because of a shortage of sobering imagery of @entity3 's killing fields or a lack of first - hand testimonies from survivors , or a lack of human rights and humanitarian reports and assessments of the situation			1
is it due to the geographical or cultural distance between @entity108 or @entity109 and @entity3 ? or are @entity111 media just reluctant , if not uninterested , to cover it because no @entity111 interests or ally is endangered by it ? would the coverage the situation in @entity3 receives be the same if it was happening in @entity26 or if @entity3 spoke @entity118 rather than @entity119 ? what if @entity120 of @entity121 or his disciples were implicated in funding murderous militia gangs in @entity3 ? or if the killing was between black @entity30 and @entity126 ? or if minerals funding @entity3 's killing and raping industries benefited the @entity130 more than the @entity131 ? but as an activist , i believe that the editors of news organizations such as @entity0 , @entity136 and the @entity137 must flood the airwaves with vivid images and news stories on the human sufferings in @entity3			1
newspapers such the @entity142 , in the @entity144 , and the @entity145 must drumbeat front - page news stories on the wars and human tragedy engulfing that country			0
unless they tip that balance a little and force policy makers in @entity109 and internationally to pay more attention and act , the killing , raping and looting that have thus far claimed over 5.4 million @entity3 lives , and continue to leave 1,100 women raped every single day , could continue to unfold undetected by the camera lenses of @entity111 media and excluded from @entity111 political agenda			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

@entity166 @entity164 : why does crisis in @entity69 get extensive media coverage , but not the killing in @entity3 ?
@entity63 is the newest militia gang terrorizing the local population
