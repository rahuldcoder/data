@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 -- two months ago , on december 4 , @entity4 made landfall in the @entity2 packing winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h )			1
it cut a swathe of destruction across the southern island of @entity11 , claimed the lives of over 1,000 people and affected over six million as it tracked across the @entity15			1
coconut and banana plantations were flattened and 216,000 homes were damaged or destroyed			2
today , more than 6,000 people in the worst affected provinces of @entity21 and @entity1 remain in evacuation centers , unable to go home			1
since @entity25 struck , @entity24 , 38 , has lived with her family in a tent provided by the @entity28 in the grounds of an elementary school in @entity31 in the @entity32 of @entity1			1
altogether , 90 families live on the site and most wo n't be returning home any time soon as their homes were totally destroyed			2
ten days ago @entity24 gave birth to a daughter , her seventh child			2
" i gave birth in a classroom because it was raining so hard and a storm was blowing outside , " she said			1
" i have never given birth away from my home and i was panicking when the labor pains started , i was afraid to give birth inside the tent			2
" for @entity24 , nursing a newborn in the tent city is n't easy			2
" it gets really hot in here , " she said			2
" at night the baby keeps on crying , she 's not comfortable so we sleep at the classroom			2
we used to live in a cool breezy place by the river , unlike here			2
" a short walk away is the remains of @entity24 's shattered village			2
simple wood and bamboo huts lie crushed and splintered under the weight of fallen coconut palms			2
@entity24 had a narrow escape			2
" we first knew something was really wrong when the coconut trees started to fall and the river started to flood , " she explained			0
" as we ran to the rice fields the trees were thumping down all around us			0
the wind was so strong we had to crawl to the school building			0
" driving through village after village in @entity1 , the massive scale of humanitarian needs is clearly evident			1
partially collapsed houses line the roads , patched up with tarpaulins that serve as roof coverings and temporary walls			0
@entity81 heads up the @entity82 , an inter-agency coordination platform that brings together local and international humanitarian organizations that are responding to emergency shelter needs in @entity11			1
he feels that support from the international community has been woefully inadequate			1
so far , only 20 % of families have received any help to carry out emergency repairs on their homes			0
" donors do n't seem to view shelter as the humanitarian priority here , " he said			1
" ninety five per cent of those affected are living in their damaged homes or makeshift shelters , but the funding shortfall for shelter repair kits means that 54,000 families may not receive the help they need			1
" the @entity28 and @entity28 ( @entity28 ) is one of the few agencies committed to providing tools , materials and technical training to families repairing their homes			0
together with the @entity109 it also aims to help some whose houses were totally destroyed to rebuild from scratch			0
" the current funding reality means that we can only provide a third of the 15,000 shelter repair kits that we included in our emergency appeal , " explained @entity113 , the @entity28 's head of operations in the @entity2			1
in terms of providing help to build more permanent shelter for families whose homes were totally destroyed , the @entity28 is only able to support 700 out of target number of 4,000 families			0
compared with other natural disasters of a similar scale , the donor response to @entity25 has been muted , despite the @entity2 government 's appeal for international assistance			1
even though it ranks as one of the most disaster - prone countries in @entity136 , the @entity2 is widely perceived by donors as a middle - income country , less deserving of humanitarian assistance than some of its neighbors			1
the global financial crisis has also put the squeeze on humanitarian aid budgets and impacted levels of public giving to disasters overseas			1
@entity25 did n't get much traction in the international media			1
competing against @entity151 for the headlines , the story appeared to drop off tv screens within days			0
with scant media coverage , the job of @entity156 fundraisers was made even more difficult			0
barely any @entity159 ngos launched public appeals in the full knowledge that levels of public sympathy just were n't high enough			0
but if a category 5 super typhoon -- the largest on the scale -- does not warrant donor attention the future looks very bleak			0
@entity81 takes a hard line on the indifference shown by the international community to the disaster			1
" the paradox is that while donors view the @entity2 as more developed and less deserving , when a disaster like @entity4 strikes , those development gains become very fragile as people 's levels of vulnerability increase so dramatically , " he said			1
@entity11 is one of the poorest regions of the country			1
development has lagged behind other parts of the country , hindered in part by various long running insurgencies spanning four decades which have led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people			1
it has been the rural poor who have been hit hardest by @entity25			1
areas such as @entity1 and @entity21 are the fruit bowl of the country exporting thousands of tons of bananas each year , but overnight the commercial plantations were decimated and thousands of workers lost their livelihoods			0
one worrying aspect of the social and economic impact of the losses inflicted by @entity4 has been the increasing numbers of people seeking work overseas			1
" recruiters " have begun to appear in some villages in @entity21 , targeting women to work as domestic help in the @entity211			0
having lost much of their source of income as well as their major family asset -- their house -- many are prepared to face the risks and leave behind their children to support their families from afar			0
with no work , 63 - year - old @entity221 spends his days salvaging bits of debris to patch up his battered home in @entity226 , @entity0			0
but just as he fixed the corrugated iron roof , a wave of fresh flooding caused by heavy rains a week ago have left the shell of his home covered in a layer of stinking mud			0
with no running water since the typhoon , his daughter has no option but to bath their grandchild in bottled mineral water donated by an aid agency			0
as the house is still uninhabitable , at night the family of six sleeps in a tent at the bottom of his land made from a tarpaulin distributed by the @entity28			0
" we worry that the floods will come again , the children wake at the slightest sound outside , " he said			0
" we have been given some food supplies and household items but what i really need is plywood and tools to fix up the house			0
" there is no disputing that emergency relief is certainly needed by families such as @entity221 's			0
but without support in all sectors , in particular shelter and livelihoods , already fragile communities will be left highly vulnerable to future disaster events and their situation will only keep deteriorating with the next storm season			1
for @entity81 , the priority is to provide households with the tools , materials and know - how to build back better			0
" unfortunately we are seeing the opposite situation , " he said			0
most ngo 's are operating skeleton teams in the field and the funding gap has meant that humanitarian standards are being compromised			1
at the moment people might receive a tarpaulin and a piece of roof sheeting and are simply told ' that 's it '			2

@entity2 island @entity11 was hit hard by @entity25
two months on , 6,000 people remain *homeless* , living in evacuation centers
muted international response to disaster hinders rebuilding
donors view @entity2 as ' less deserving ' of humanitarian assistance
