-- pope @entity2 's decision to resign caught a lot of @entity5 watchers , apparently even some in his inner circle , off - guard			1
they should not have been so surprised			0
canon law includes a provision for a papal resignation			1
but traditionally , popes continue their reigns until their natural deaths , much as a father can never " resign " from his place in a family			2
before he was pope , as cardinal @entity2 , @entity2 watched an increasingly frail pope @entity20 struggle to shoulder his many responsibilities and respond , in his final years , to the scandal of the clerical sexual abuse crisis in the @entity24 and @entity25			1
another reason it is not a shock : in @entity32 's " @entity31 , " a book - length interview with @entity2 , the pope was unambiguous about his openness to the idea of papal resignation			1
too tired to go on , pope @entity2 resigns yes , a pope could resign , @entity2 said			1
" if a pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office , then he has a right and , under some circumstances , also an obligation to resign			1
" and by some accounts , @entity2 made three pilgrimages to the tomb of pope @entity47 , who resigned from the papacy in 1294			1
so what comes next ? presuming that this pope 's resignation follows the same protocol as the death of a pope , all major decisions and pronouncements will be on hold after @entity2 's reign ends february 28			1
the @entity59 will be vacant -- officially " @entity60			0
" during the vacancy , cardinal @entity61 , the @entity59 's camerlengo , @entity63 for chamberlain , takes charge with the help of three cardinal assistants			2
to prevent forgery , @entity61 will break the pope 's fisherman 's ring by hitting it with a small hammer , a tradition that was started when the ring was used to seal documents			2
@entity2 's apartment will be sealed to prevent any hijinks with official documents			1
opinion : why pope will be remembered for generations @entity61 will organize a conclave of 118 cardinals , who must meet in @entity86 within 20 days of the end of @entity2 's reign to deliberate on a successor			1
white smoke rising from the @entity92 's chimney will indicate a selection			2
guessing who that selection might be , one of the church 's favorite spectator sports , has already begun among papal watchers worldwide			1
among the " papabile , " or possible contenders , are cardinal @entity102 , archbishop of @entity103 , which would return the job to an @entity63 ; cardinal @entity106 , former archbishop of @entity107 ; cardinal @entity108 of @entity109 , president of the @entity111 , which would be a nod to the @entity115 church 's growing numbers and influence ; and @entity117 of @entity118 , indicating a liberating take on the church in the future			0
the @entity47 's resignation , explained how about @entity124 @entity123 or @entity125 from the @entity24 ? they are outside contenders			2
the rest of the world thinks @entity24 are super-powered enough already			0
whoever is chosen will face the many challenges that pope @entity2 has no doubt wisely decided he no longer has the stamina to address , including : the growing secularization and antipathy of the @entity136			1
violence and intolerance visited on @entity139 in @entity141 nations like @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
the evaporating @entity139 presence in the @entity146 , @entity147 and elsewhere in the @entity148			0
more brutal revelations of clerical sexual abuse in @entity115 and @entity151 , which have yet to adequately confront the problem			0
growing calls for optional celibacy			0
persisting demands for women 's ordination and more			0
is there somebody out there who really wants this job ? surprising standards for next @entity165 leader perhaps now , with confidence that a new precedent has been set and an actual well - deserved retirement would not be completely out of the question , someone will be courageous or foolhardy enough to step forward			0
and in an oddity of church tradition , that person need not be a cleric , only a baptized male			0
so if you are , feel free to submit your application to the @entity178			0
meanwhile , let us pray whoever is the next pope is also equipped with compassion , mercy and vision			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 : pope @entity2 's decision to resign caught papal watchers off - guard
@entity187 : but canon law allows papal resignation ; it 's tradition that popes reign till death
@entity2 said a pope is obligated to resign if he ca *n't* handle duties
@entity187 : whoever is chosen will deal with huge challenges facing @entity203
