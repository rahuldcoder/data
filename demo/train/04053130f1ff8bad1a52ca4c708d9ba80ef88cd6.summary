-- the video is as short as it is surprising			2
a hand tilts a glass bottle containing a red glob of ketchup , which -- instead of oozing out in slow motion or getting stuck -- slides out easily , leaving the bottle nearly spotless			1
posted last week , the 20 - second clip has been viewed more than 125,000 times on @entity11 , prompting dozens of news stories and brightening the spirits of impatient ketchup lovers everywhere			1
but it 's not exactly what @entity16 had in mind when he and his students at the @entity20 set out to develop a new kind of slippery coating that would help de-ice planes , or keep water droplets from sticking to steam turbines in power plants			1
" i never thought a ketchup bottle would make us this famous , " said @entity16 , a professor of mechanical engineering at @entity20			1
" we were all focused on [ solving ] the big problems , like water and energy			0
" but one of the goals of @entity36 's @entity20 lab is to develop potential commercial products , not just publish research in academic journals			1
the coating , which he and his graduate students call @entity42 , seemed more immediately viable as a food - packaging product , he said			1
@entity42 is made from a secret cocktail of edible , nontoxic materials that can be sprayed into bottles or other food containers			1
videos on the @entity42 site show it working its slippery magic on plastic bottles of jelly and mustard , too			2
" you could literally scratch it off and eat it , " @entity16 told @entity0 in an interview			0
" it 's that safe			0
" @entity42 first gained attention earlier this month at @entity20 's $ 100k @entity59 , an annual forum for launching academic projects into the commercial marketplace , where it won an @entity64			1
now @entity36 and his students are fielding interview requests , talking to bottling companies , filing for patents and planning to launch a startup this summer			0
an @entity20 grad student , @entity72 , will serve as ceo , @entity16 said			2
as @entity36 sees it , @entity42 offers several benefits : it 's more convenient for consumers , and it makes recycling easier because the bottles are clean			1
it also wastes less food , because people wo n't be tossing out bottles coated with mustard that they ca n't squeeze out			0
he also believes @entity42 has practical applications beyond condiments , such as high - end cosmetics			2
who wants to waste precious drops of $ 50 hand lotion because they ca n't get the stuff out of the bottle ? " it works on everything we 've tried so far , " @entity72 told @entity0			0
@entity16 and his students hope to have their product on supermarket shelves within two years			0
right now they have momentum on their side , thanks to a deceptively simple idea , a niche nobody realized needed filling -- and a little video			0
" it just went viral , " @entity16 said			0
" the video sold it			0

@entity20 professor and his students *invent* *nonstick* coating that makes ketchup slide out of the bottle
@entity42 is made from edible , nontoxic materials that can be sprayed into food containers
a @entity11 video of the ketchup bottle in action has been viewed more than 125,000 times
