-- global debate over the @entity3 crisis is expected to ratchet up this week , with @entity5 and @entity6 leaders grappling with the thorny issue and @entity9 members reassessing whether to take further action			1
@entity12 , joint envoy to @entity3 for the @entity9 and the @entity13 , will meet friday with @entity15 secretary of state @entity14 in @entity16 to discuss @entity3 , sources told @entity0			1
the crisis that has killed thousands over 15 months was expected to dominate the agenda at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity5 , on monday			1
world leaders have accused @entity5 of supporting and selling arms to the @entity3 regime -- assertions that @entity5 president @entity25 has denied			1
@entity26 , meanwhile , assumed the revolving presidency of the @entity28			0
@entity26 and @entity5 are the only members of the council that have repeatedly barred attempts to formally condemn the @entity3 government			1
but a commentary in @entity26 's state - run @entity35 newspaper held out hope for a struggling peace plan and warned against military intervention in @entity3			1
" the international community should support @entity12 's peace plan instead of losing confidence and patience , " the paper said			1
if the @entity12 plan is blocked , " then it will most likely push this country into the abyss of full - scale war			1
" a full - scale civil war would trigger @entity51 military intervention and severe consequences , the @entity35 said			2
" @entity55 civilian casualties , enormous property losses , an increasingly turbulent society ... the lessons learnt from mistakes made in @entity60 are still fresh , " the paper said			0
in @entity3 on monday , 42 people were killed monday , according to the opposition @entity62			1
the @entity62 posted a letter on its @entity65 page slamming @entity5 and @entity26 for blocking tougher action against @entity3 , and criticizing the @entity9 observer mission in the country			1
" based on our own investigation , we have determined that the @entity9 observer mission has consciously provided the regime with political cover			0
therefore , the @entity9 observer mission is not substantively different from that found in the @entity13 's observer mission			0
the practices of the @entity9 observers on the ground confirm that their current mission has been convoluted with political goals , and this is tantamount to putting the cart before the horse			0
" " since the beginning of the uprising , the regime has systematically resorted to lies , claiming the existence of @entity90 fundamentalists , @entity92 gunmen and terrorists as part of a vile foreign conspiracy to change the power structure and its relationship to society , " the @entity62 wrote			0
" the regime 's survival , in fact , has become completely dependent on foreign forms of political , economic , military and technical support			0
" it called on the @entity28 and @entity12 to " take note of the need for the @entity9 observers ' mission to evolve to include a role for the @entity111 to undertake an investigation and verify who is responsible for the gunfire and violence			2
" @entity3 , meanwhile , said on state - run media that 30 " army and law enforcement martyrs " were buried monday			1
the @entity119 said about 100 government soldiers have been killed by rebel fighters during the past three days			2
@entity122 denied sunday that government forces were behind the recent " outrageous " massacre of more than 100 civilians , including dozens of small children , in the town of @entity128			0
" truthfully , even monsters do not do what we saw , especially in the @entity128 massacre , " he told lawmakers			0
" the criminal or criminals who committed this crime and others are not criminals for an hour or criminals for a day , they are constant criminals and are surely planning other crimes			2
" speaking before the newly elected @entity144 , @entity143 decried what he called terrorists and the conspiracy against @entity3			2
" at this time , we are facing a war from abroad , " @entity143 said in his first public speech since january			1
" dealing with it is different from dealing with people from inside			2
" his speech came more than a week after the @entity28 condemned the @entity128 massacre , with members casting blame on government forces for the deaths			0
opinion : is @entity3 unsolvable ? @entity122 's remarks stand in stark contrast to what the opposition and many world leaders have said for more than a year : that @entity143 's forces , not " terrorists , " are behind a sustained slaughter stemming from the regime 's crackdown on dissidents			1
as the president spoke , shells rained on the anti-government bastion of @entity173 , the @entity62 said			0
thirty - seven people were killed sunday in @entity3 , five of them children , the group said			1
@entity178 's address came a day after @entity12 said that " the specter of all - out civil war , with a worrying sectarian dimension , grows by the day			1
" @entity183 's foreign minister , @entity182 , said the @entity3 regime is pushing for a sectarian crisis			2
" the @entity3 opposition lacks the means to defend itself , and the regime is getting weapons from everywhere , " he said sunday			1
" for a while now , we noticed that the regime has been trying to turn the crisis into a sectarian conflict			0
" he added that , while @entity3 had agreed to @entity12 's peace plan , the regime has not implemented it			1
" the regime just wants to buy time , " @entity182 said			0
at a meeting of @entity13 foreign ministers saturday , @entity196 prime minister @entity197 said @entity12 's peace initiative should be placed under @entity201 of the @entity9 charter , @entity196 's news agency reported saturday			2
such a move would allow the @entity28 to take action that could include military force			0
@entity9 @entity206 ban ki - moon said sunday that he had taken note of the @entity13 leaders ' suggestions , including requests to increase the number of @entity9 observers and to set a time limit for the effort			0
" all these are very important recommendations , and i hope these will be discussed by the @entity28 members			0
at this time , i would welcome the wider international discussions on the future course of action , " @entity206 told reporters			0
the crisis in @entity3 began nearly 15 months ago , when a tough government crackdown on protesters spiraled out of control and spawned a national anti-government uprising			2
@entity122 's family has ruled @entity3 for 42 years			1
the @entity9 for months has said more than 9,000 people have died in @entity3			1
but death counts from opposition groups range from more than 12,000 to more than 14,000			0
tens of thousands have been displaced			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of casualties or violence from @entity3 because the government restricts access to foreign journalists			2
@entity0 's @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
