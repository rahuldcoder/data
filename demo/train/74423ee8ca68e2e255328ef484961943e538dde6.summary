-- the daughter of @entity4 's president supports the re-election bid of @entity7 president @entity6 , but believes he could do more were it not for the pressures he is facing , she said in an interview broadcast monday on " @entity11			1
" " as a citizen of the world , i would like him to win , " said @entity12 , daughter of @entity13 , in the exclusive interview , which was conducted friday in @entity15			1
" given the choices , i prefer @entity6			1
" the 49 - year - old gay rights advocate said that @entity6 has been constrained in his ability to effect change			1
" he wants to do much more than what he 's been able to do , " she said			2
" that 's the way i interpret it personally			2
i do n't know if i 'm being objective			0
" still , she said , " i believe that @entity6 needs another opportunity and he needs greater support to move forward with his projects and with his ideas , which i believe come from the bottom of his heart			1
" asked if @entity6 would lift the half - century - old trade embargo on @entity4 if he could , @entity13 said , " i believe that @entity6 is a fair man			1
and i believe @entity6 needs greater support to be able to make these decisions			1
if @entity6 had all the political support of the @entity7 people , then we could normalize our relationships , as good or better than we had under president @entity40			1
" during his single term as president , from 1977 to 1981 , @entity40 eased restrictions on @entity7 travel to @entity4			0
@entity13 added that she supports the release of @entity47 , a @entity7 citizen arrested in @entity4 in 2009 and sentenced to 15 years on charges of subversion			1
but , she added , she also wants to see the release of the " @entity51 , " who are being held in the @entity7 for crimes of espionage			1
@entity13 was unswayed by @entity47 ' recent request that he be allowed to visit his 90 - year - old mother before she dies if he promises to return afterward to prison in @entity4			1
" @entity47 has been granted everything that he 's asked for : he has been able to see his wife , he has been able to have matrimonial , conjugal visits , and he has been treated with respect and dignity the way we always treat prisoners in @entity4 , " @entity13 said			1
" we have n't received the same treatment on the other hand for our five prisoners who have very long sentences that are not right			0
i think that the six must be released -- both the five @entity4 and @entity47			1
" " is that what you 're saying , that @entity47 should be released and the @entity51 ? " host @entity71 asked			1
" of course , " @entity13 responded			1
" i 'm referring to the five @entity4 and @entity47			1
i believe that this would be the happiest solution for all involved			0
" the gay rights activist said that sexual orientation and gender identification are among the rights that communist @entity4 still needs to address			0
a bill legalizing civil unions , not same - sex marriage , has been proposed , " however , this has n't happened as yet , " she said			0
" and people who are in same - sex couples do not have any protection in that sense			0
" she predicted the legislature would address the matter , which her father has not opposed , this year			0
@entity13 said the nation had learned to acknowledge and correct past mistakes after its aggressive quarantine policy for @entity96 - positive men and women during the early years of the aids epidemic was abandoned in 1993			1
" i never agreed with these quarantines , " she said			0
" there were several international health organizations that evaluated these quarantines as a positive thing at a time when not much was known about how the epidemic spreads			0
" @entity71 pointed to a @entity107 description of @entity4 as " the only country in @entity109 that represses virtually all forms of political dissent			0
" but @entity13 said the rights group " does not represent the opinion of the @entity51 people			1
and their informants are mercenaries			0
they 're people who have been paid by a foreign government for media shows that do not represent @entity51 positions directly			1
" she defended her nation as one that allows dissent			0
" people who dissent do n't go to jail , " she said			0
" everybody in @entity4 expresses their view and there 's a political participation so that we can express ourselves and question everything			2
" holding an opinion contrary to that of the government " enriches the debate , " she said			0
" no one goes to prison for an opinion , rather for serving foreign interests who pay them			0
that 's called being a mercenary and that 's penalized in laws everywhere in the world , including the laws of this country			2
" she said the island 's single - party system would disappear if other nations would stop trying to impose their will on @entity4			2
" if @entity4 's sovereignty were n't threatened , if the internal affairs of @entity4 were n't manipulated in media campaigns , if @entity4 were n't the subject of an economic and trade embargo , which has caused so many problems for us , then in @entity4 , it would n't make sense to have a sole party , just one party , " she said			2
though some critics have said the nation relies on the embargo to crack down on internal dissent , and that the nation 's socialist system would collapse if the @entity7 were to lift the embargo , @entity13 disagreed about what would happen to her country			1
" i think it would become stronger , " she said			0
" this is why they do n't lift the embargo			0
" @entity13 offered no sympathy for @entity179 , the dissident blogger inside @entity4 who has won multiple awards for her work , which is critical of the @entity13 government			1
" she gives service to foreign powers who are interested in eliminating the @entity51 experience , " @entity13 said			1
" she 's an official voice of the global dominant powers			2
" @entity13 disputed @entity179 's assertion that she was not allowed to work			1
" she is allowed to work in @entity4 , " @entity13 said			2
" but she makes much more money with the prizes , which are being sent to her from abroad , than for any work that she might do with the very low wages that we have in @entity4			0
" @entity13 predicted that @entity179 's audience will " get bored of hearing lies , " and her influence will wane			1
" she does n't really fight for authentic rights ; she 's not committed to the rights movement in @entity4 , because she does n't even participate in any of the debates that are trying to achieve rights			2
" @entity13 blamed the trade embargo for the fact that many @entity4 are not able to use the @entity205			2
" we pay @entity205 over satellite , which is very expensive , " she said			0
" we do n't have the access to the fiber optic lines that pass by @entity4			0
we 're negotiating with @entity210 to help us so we can maximize access to @entity205			0
" but she said @entity4 still have access to " very big social networks			0
" " there is more access to the internet in @entity4 , legal and illegal , than you can imagine , because the @entity51 people are a curious people			2
and you ca n't deny us the access to information			0
" asked about sen. @entity223 's description of her as " a vocal advocate of the regime , an opponent of democracy , who has defended the brutal repression of democracy activists , " @entity13 called the @entity230 from @entity231 " a person who really does n't have his feet down on the ground			1
" asked why the @entity7 had issued @entity13 a visa , a @entity236 spokesman noted that she had visited the @entity7 twice during the @entity239 administration			2
" however , one should not mistake the fact that a visa was granted to this person with our general policy towards @entity4 , " acting assistant secretary of state for public affairs @entity240 told reporters in @entity242			0
" in fact , we want , and we allow freedom of expression in our country , something , which in fact , does not occur in @entity4			0

" i would like him to win , " @entity12 says of @entity6 's election bid
" @entity6 needs another opportunity , " she adds
@entity13 says @entity47 and the " @entity51 " should be released
