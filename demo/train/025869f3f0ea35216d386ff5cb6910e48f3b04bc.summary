" crowd control " took on a whole new meaning wednesday night as a room full of partygoers were given power over a cocktail - making robot controlled by their smartphones			1
attendees at a party for the @entity10 here were invited to send a drink recipe via a smartphone app to the @entity14 , a three - armed robot designed especially for the show			1
they could then interact with attendees of similar taste to collaboratively design their perfect drink via social media			1
@entity22 's @entity21 wanted to see what would happen when you let a mass of people take control of an industrial manufacturing machine			1
the idea , according to project leader @entity29 , is to demonstrate how digital technology has the potential to take the power of factory robots away from big companies and into the hands of the people			1
@entity29 said the team had the idea in january and hurriedly set about getting the arms -- based on the classic factory production - line robot -- programmed to gracefully slice a lemon , shake a cocktail shaker , pour liquids carefully and so on			2
the team purposefully chose the look of the iconic orange industrial robot arm to make the point that big manufacturing technology was now becoming accessible to everyone			1
" it 's a metaphor , " he said			2
" this is the third industrial revolution			1
people now have the power to control very powerful technology			2
" at the party , every time someone created a drink the recipe would go up on a big screen behind the bar and the crowd could see it and add their own changes to the recipe -- and try the drink			2
" the point is to learn from one another , to design together , " he said			0
@entity29 said there was an emerging market for people who want to make things , a movement back to craft culture that takes advantage of modern technology -- sometimes referred to as the maker movement ( hence the name of the robot )			1
the movement espouses the @entity83 inventor or developer and promotes the sharing of free technology			0
he said @entity22 's example of easy - access digital manufacturing could transform clothes making , furniture design -- whatever people wanted			1
uses could range from manufacturers engaging focus groups in a much more hands - on way at an early stage of product development to mass customization or individual use of the machines			0
@entity103 , research director at @entity105 consultancy @entity104 , which specializes in the impact technology is having on society and business , said this was a model that was already working very well in web development			0
" design should take hours not weeks , with a maximum of customer interaction			0
it 's not hard to imagine how that could be extended to creation of , in this case drinks , but also other objects , once @entity122 printing is in the mix , " he said			0
" there 's no reason at all why small - run manufacturing should not become a socially driven activity			0
meanwhile it is very interesting to think how the @entity129 - that is , devices and objects with built - in connectivity - can link to our ability to use applications and exchange information socially			0
" @entity29 added : " before , to design , you generally had to be a designer or spend your whole life learning to be a master carver			0
the accessibility brings you back to a basic need to create			0
you can design , make and enjoy			2

@entity22 allows partygoers to control robot *bartender* using their *cellphones*
lab wanted drinkers to collaborate via social media to make new cocktails
*scientists* say making robots available to all via phones signals " third industrial revolution "
