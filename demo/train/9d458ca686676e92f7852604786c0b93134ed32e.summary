@entity0 , @entity1 -- somewhere in southern @entity5 , a convoy of 280 white - painted trucks snaked its way tuesday toward the @entity1 border			1
depending on whom you ask , what 's inside may either be a treasure trove of relief goods for war - weary civilians , or the vanguard of a @entity5 invasion of eastern @entity1			1
with thousands of @entity5 troops still posted near the @entity1 border and @entity1 's military putting increasing pressure on @entity21 fighters around the city of @entity23 , many in @entity1 and elsewhere feared the latter			1
" @entity5 keeps inventing new excuses for their policy , " @entity1 's deputy foreign minister , @entity26 , told reporters tuesday in @entity0			1
" in @entity31 , it was defending pro-russian minorities			0
in @entity1 's @entity35 , preventing @entity34 invasion			1
" " in @entity45 , " he said referring to the war - torn eastern region of @entity1 that includes the contested cities of @entity23 and @entity40 , " they are trying to use the pretext of humanitarian aid and assistance			0
" without offering proof , @entity1 officials have even accused @entity5 of repainting military vehicles white to disguise their efforts			1
in @entity0 , where many loyalties lie with the @entity1 government , skepticism of @entity5 president @entity54 's motive was rampant among ordinary residents			1
" normal people do not send guns to kill people and food for them to eat in the same cars , " said it specialist @entity56			0
" i think most @entity1 want him to leave @entity1 alone			0
" and it 's not just the @entity1 raising concerns about a possible @entity5 trojan horse			1
@entity67 flummoxed in an interview monday with @entity70 , @entity34 secretary general @entity68 spoke of a " high probability " @entity5 will invade @entity1			1
" we see the @entity5 developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation and we see a military buildup that could be used to conduct such illegal military operations in @entity1 , " he said			2
@entity5 has acknowledged sending the convoy			0
in a conversation monday with the president of the @entity82 , @entity54 said his country was working with the @entity84 to deliver aid to civilians suffering as a result of savage fighting there			0
except the @entity67 says it does n't know what @entity54 is talking about			0
@entity84 spokesman @entity91 said the agency does n't have any agreement with @entity5 on such a convoy			2
and @entity84 @entity96 operations chief @entity95 said tuesday in @entity97 that the agency has n't gotten much clarity from @entity100 about its purported role in the operation , including how the aid would be handed over and security guarantees for @entity67 workers			2
" we said that we could be on board , but that we needed to have some clarification first regarding modalities , practical steps that have to be implemented prior to a launch of such an operation , " he said			0
@entity67 officials do n't even know what 's in the shipment , @entity95 said			2
according to the @entity5 news agency @entity117 , the shipment is bound for @entity40 and contains 400 tons of grains , 100 tons of sugar , 62 tons of baby food , 54 tons of medical supplies , sleeping bags and " electrical power units			0
" " false pretense " but after an incident saturday in which @entity1 officials claim to have stopped a purported aid convoy accompanied by @entity5 troops , @entity1 has vowed to stop any " uncertified " aid convoy from @entity5			1
in the reported saturday incident , @entity1 's deputy head of the presidential administration @entity131 , told a @entity1 television channel that the convoy was nothing more than a @entity5 provocation			1
" under a false pretense of agreement with the @entity84 in @entity1 , a humanitarian convoy of ' peacekeepers ' was ready to enter the country , apparently in order to provoke a full - scale conflict , " he said			0
@entity145 officials have warned @entity5 against using aid as a means of wading deeper into the @entity1 conflict			1
at a @entity151 meeting saturday , @entity145 ambassador @entity149 said @entity5 has no business delivering aid in @entity1 when international aid groups are better equipped to do the job			1
" therefore , any further unilateral intervention by @entity5 into @entity1 territory -- including one under the guise of providing humanitarian aid -- would be completely unacceptable and deeply alarming , " she said			1
" and it would be viewed as an invasion of @entity1			0
" secretary of state @entity162 made a similar point with his @entity5 counterpart on saturday , according to the @entity165			0
while @entity168 leaders have refused any suggestion that @entity5 acts could draw @entity34 nations into war over @entity1 , they do say it would lead to even stricter economic sanctions against @entity5 than those already imposed by the @entity145 and the @entity176			2
so far , @entity5 officials have shrugged off the sanctions			0
rebels on the ropes ? @entity100 's decision to send the convoy comes as some 50,000 @entity1 troops press forward with an offensive to rout rebel fighters from @entity23			1
they have put increasing pressure on the rebel fighters , and @entity1 officials say they expect to be able to fully recapture the city by @entity1 's @entity190 on august 24			0
the ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with a political crisis over whether @entity1 would seek closer ties with @entity96 or @entity5 -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern @entity1 since mid-april , according to estimates from @entity151 officials			2
they say that the death toll has been on the rise in recent days , with reports of at least 41 killed and 143 wounded on thursday alone			0
hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in @entity1 or across the border in @entity5 , the @entity200 says			2
@entity205 reported and wrote from @entity206 ; @entity207 reported from @entity0 ; @entity2 's @entity208 , @entity209 and journalist @entity210 contributed to this report .			0
