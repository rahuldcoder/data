forty years after they were convicted by a jury of firebombing a grocery store in @entity3 , @entity4 , civil rights activists who became known as the " @entity3 " were pardoned monday by the state 's outgoing governor			1
" these convictions were tainted by naked racism and represent an ugly stain on @entity4 's criminal justice system that can not be allowed to stand any longer , " said gov. @entity8			1
" justice demands that this stain finally be removed			1
" in 1972 , nine black men and one white woman were convicted in the store firebombing in the coastal city despite their claims of innocence and their supporters ' vehement argument that the defendants were victims of racially biased prosecutors			2
their sentences were reduced in 1978 by the state 's governor then , @entity25 , and two years later their convictions were overturned in federal court for reasons of misconduct by the prosecutors			1
but until monday there were no pardons , and the sting of the guilty verdicts still followed the six surviving members of the group that was known nationwide as the @entity3			1
@entity8 said that among the key evidence that led her to grant pardons of innocence were recently discovered notes from the prosecutor who picked the jury			2
the notes showed the prosecutor preferred white jurors who might be members of the @entity45 and one black juror was described as an " @entity48 type			1
" @entity8 also pointed to the federal court 's ruling that the prosecutor knew his star witness lied on the witness stand			1
that witness and other witnesses recanted a few years after the trial			1
@entity57 , a @entity4 historian and a visiting professor at @entity59 , said he was given the notes two years ago and started to go through them recently when the @entity62 called again for pardons for the @entity3			1
" it was pretty shocking stuff , " he told @entity64 on monday			2
there were at least six potential jurors with " @entity68 ! ! " written next to them , he said			2
next to a woman 's name it said , " no , she associates with @entity74			1
" on the back of the legal pad , the prosecutor , @entity78 , had apparently written the advantages and disadvantages of a mistrial , @entity57 said			2
one of the advantages was a fresh start with a new jury			0
@entity78 told the @entity85 in october that the handwriting on the legal pad was his , but people were misinterpreting his notes			0
" i could have had an all - white jury , but i did n't want to do that			0
why would i leave a @entity45 on the jury ? " @entity78 said			0
he told the newspaper that he wanted " blacks who could be fair " on the jury			0
it was actually the second jury that ruled on the case			0
the first jury was dismissed after a mistrial was declared when @entity78 said he was ill. that jury had two whites			0
@entity57 said the early 1970s were " really hard and really bad " and a " bubbling cauldron " of racially heated struggles in the state			0
@entity4 had the largest number of @entity45 members in the country , he said , but there was also a strong @entity110 - @entity109 freedom movement			2
" ( the time ) was seething with anger and resentment and fear and rage , " he said			0
and one of the @entity3 was the rev. @entity117 , whom @entity57 described as a handsome , fearless civil rights leader who came from a brilliant family			1
he was a threat to the " old guard " of @entity4 leaders			0
@entity117 was a target for police even before the firebombing occurred , @entity57 said			0
@entity117 , who would become the head of the @entity62 in 1993 , was paroled in 1979			1
most of the others involved in the case struggled after they were set free			0
" things went badly for them , " @entity57 said			0
" many of them had their health broken in prison			2

outgoing governor says convictions were " tainted by naked racism "
governor 's decree says finally that " @entity3 " members were innocent
one former member went on to become leader of the @entity62
members of group have been out of prison for years , some have died
