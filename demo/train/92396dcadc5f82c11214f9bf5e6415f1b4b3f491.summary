some 1,348 people have been executed by the state since 1976 , when the @entity2 allowed capital punishment to resume after a four - year moratorium			1
twenty - eight were given lethal injection this year , three over the past several days			0
while the annual number of executions and death sentences continue to drop nationwide , it remains a legally and socially acceptable form of justice for aggravated murder in 32 states			2
but a new book reveals how the high court four decades ago was on the verge of eliminating the death penalty permanently			2
@entity19 's " a wild justice : the @entity25 and resurrection of @entity27 in @entity28 " ( @entity29 ) is a stunning insider 's look at the legal and social forces dividing the justices during turbulent times			1
for two centuries death by hanging , firing squad , gas chamber , electrocution , and toxic chemicals ( among nearly a dozen methods ) was completely ingrained in the @entity28 political fabric			0
but @entity19 chronicles one justice 's quiet , improbable crusade to change the legal landscape beginning in the early 1960s , in the process conflicting the court like few issues before or since			1
money and politics court 's first big case this term his narrative crests with @entity49 ( 1972 ) , when the court struck down that state 's capital laws , and effectively putting executions on hold			1
the 5 - 4 decision produced nine separate opinions , and no controlling precedent			2
it was a collection of 60,000 words ( the longest in the court 's history ) that gave only temporary optimism to death penalty opponents			1
@entity65 , executive power on @entity2 docket @entity68 then made changes to their laws , and the court four years later ( on the eve of the nation 's @entity73 ) , reversed itself in stunning fashion			1
@entity77 spoke recently to @entity19 , a former capital defense lawyer , and now a professor at @entity79			1
@entity77 : your story begins with justice @entity82 , who wanted the @entity2 to test whether capital punishment itself was fundamentally unconstitutional			1
@entity19 : " it just shows how utterly remarkable what @entity82 did			1
he said : i want to revisit this issue			0
in 1963 , it was so widely accepted that the death penalty was unconstitutional that the defendants in other cases did n't challenge its constitutionality			0
he made the argument on their behalf			0
there are no @entity99 anymore			0
it 's hard to imagine a justice today saying ' i want to raise this up to national agenda			2
' the court is so often in the business of following change rather than leading it			2
" @entity77 : one of the key characters in your book is the prominent criminal appellate attorney and legal scholar @entity111			2
he was @entity82 's law clerk at the time and helped formulate the legal reasoning			1
@entity19 : " i hope people understand what an extraordinary , revolutionary , and subversive idea that @entity82 and his partner @entity111 advanced in 1963			1
whatever your views on the death penalty and the @entity2 , everyone acknowledges as a subject of discussion that the @entity123 is an evolving document and that the death penalty is constitutionally problematic , if not unconstitutional			1
in 1963 , when they started , nobody did			0
" @entity77 : what was the political fallout from @entity82 's prodding ? @entity19 : " after @entity82 publishes his dissent ( on the court 's initial refusal to hear a death penalty constitutional appeal ) , the legal people at the @entity132 sensed something was afoot , and they begin constructing a campaign to try to bring executions in the @entity28 to a halt			1
the @entity132 legal defense team , for a 10 - year period , got courts to stop executions , not by winning a broad decision at the federal level , but buy winning dozens of local cases , raising legal arguments in individual cases			1
it 's an astonishing accomplishment , whatever your views of capital punishment			1
" @entity77 : so by 1972 , the @entity2 was ready to fully tackle the constitutional questions			1
it ultimately struck down capital punishment â€” effectively voiding laws in 40 states -- but why were the justices unable to agree on the reasoning ? @entity19 : " there is one particular quirk about this history that acted as a barrier to a consensus view coalescing			1
at the beginning of the 1971 term when @entity169 was decided , ( chief justice ) @entity166 said he wanted the case to be conducted in complete secrecy			2
and he wanted each justice to write his own opinion			0
and consequently the justices operated in almost complete isolation throughout the term , which had some very bizarre results			1
it was one of the contributing factors to the splintering of this 5 - 4 decision with nine opinions			0
" it 's almost impossible to discuss the case because there is no majority opinion			2
( @entity189 justices ) @entity187 , @entity190 , and @entity191 wrote opinions that really seemed to be against the death penalty in all cases			2
@entity191 ' decision was premised basically on the issue of racism , @entity187 's on human dignity , @entity190 on a host of consideration including inequality			2
( @entity204 's ) @entity203 and @entity205 's opinions are the most closely aligned			2
@entity203 said the problem with the death penalty is its randomness among murderers , @entity205 says the problem with the death penalty is that it is n't applied frequently enough to achieve deterrence			0
even the four dissenters could n't agree			0
" test your knowledge of the @entity2 @entity77 : you write @entity203 ( appointed by president @entity216 ) and @entity205 ( appointed by president @entity217 ) were the key players here			1
@entity19 : " there 's a lot of evidence that @entity203 made a deal with @entity205 because he emerged ( in june 1972 ) with a changed position on capital punishment			1
where he had previously been against it in all cases , @entity205 was now taking the position that his problem with the death penalty was its application			0
he told his clerks at the beginning of the term that he wanted to write a " short snapper " saying that the death penalty treated people as a means to an end , and was therefore unconstitutional			0
and there are hints in some of @entity203 's earlier opinions that he was , in fact , morally opposed to capital punishment			1
but that is not the position that he ultimately articulated in his concurrence in @entity245			0
" @entity77 : but by 1976 , that all unraveled			0
what happened ? @entity19 : " grand political theories of judicial behavior do n't explain very much			1
these are socially situated actors who have different views at different times and are responding to their perceptions of their own constituencies			1
they 're not elected but they feel that they are answering to people			0
it 's a very messy history			1
" @entity77 : is there something about the death penalty itself that makes the court 's jurisprudence so problematic -- the finality , the questions of life and death			1
@entity19 : " there is something different about the death penalty			1
it 's not surprising during this four - year interim period that each of these justices -- with the exception of ( conservative @entity276 ) @entity275 , who does n't seem troubled at all by this -- each has their antenna up			2
it 's not like a tax case			2
but i do n't think it 's categorically different than @entity284 ( abortion rights ) or the civil rights cases			2
i just think we do n't know all the behind - the - scenes stories because these are very hard to write			0
but i got incredibly lucky			0
i had a moment in history when the archives were available to me , as were many of the key players that i interviewed			0
all agreed there was definitely at the time tremendous frustration with how chief justice @entity166 was managing the cases			0
his colleagues had little respect for him			0
" so by 1976 , 37 states had passed new death penalty laws and they tried to remove arbitrariness in its application -- based on what the court has mandated -- or at least made a good faith effort to attempt to do this			0
one of the great stories in my book is that @entity308 , @entity203 , and ( justice @entity309 met at a local restaurant called the @entity311 , and there agreed that the mandatory death penalty for murder was reprehensible , but that they would also uphold the ' guided discretions ' statutes ( through the use of what are called ' aggravating ' or ' mitigating ' factors either favoring or blocking its use )			0
that was their solomonic compromise			0
the 1976 compromise was that similar capital cases should be treated alike			0
but also that no mandatory death penalty for certain crimes means individual cases must be treated individually			0
it 's a fundamental contradiction that has made death penalty law in the @entity28 for the past 40 years at a minimum confusing and problematic , at a maximum completely inconsistent and incomprehensible			2
" @entity77 : is the current court ready to tackle the issue again ? @entity19 : " it certainly seems that it merits another day in court after 40 years			1
there are a lot of reasons to think that ( moderate - conservative ) justice @entity343 's vote is up for grabs and his mind is open on this question			0
so i do n't think the outcome of a case would be predetermined one way or another			0
" @entity77 : what has the court said on mandatory dna testing and re-testing for all capital inmates ? @entity19 : " imagine what a difference it would make if the @entity2 said that states were required to have @entity352 exoneration projects as part of their death penalty systems			1
in other words , if they guaranteed somebody that type of post-conviction appeal			0
they 've removed themselves utterly from the process of trying to make the system better			0
everybody agrees that the conviction and execution of an innocent person is morally intolerable and yet the @entity2 has n't gotten involved in the business of what 's required , how much due process is required , how much extra due process is required , to protect against the execution of an innocent			1

@entity2 struck down capital punishment in 1972 , but executions resumed four years later
@entity19 gives insider 's look at legal and social forces dividing the court in turbulent times
@entity2 operated in almost complete isolation , which produced some bizarre results
justices are actors with " different views at different times " and are part of " messy history , " @entity19 says
