-- the ire and angst accompanying @entity4 's most recent tweaks to its interface are truly astounding			1
the complaints rival the irritation of @entity9 's dial - up users back in the mid- ' 90s , who were getting too many busy signals when they tried to get online			2
the big difference , of course , is that @entity9 's users were paying customers			1
in the case of @entity4 , which we do n't even pay to use , we are n't the customers at all			1
let 's start with the changes themselves			0
until now , the main thing that showed up on users ' pages was a big list of " updates " from all the friends and companies and groups to which they were connected			0
it was a giant chronological list that made no distinction between an article ( like this one ) that may have been recommended by a hundred friends and the news that one person just changed his relationship status or had a funny dream			0
@entity4 has now prioritized that flow of stories into a news feed that puts " top stories " on top , and the more chronological list of everything down below			2
top stories are selected by an algorithm of some sort that " knows " what will be important to the user based on past behavior and numbers of connections to those recommending the story , and so on			0
meanwhile , as if to make up for this violation of the what - just - happened - is - the - only - thing - that - matters ethos of the social net , @entity4 added a live , @entity61 - like stream of everything everyone else is doing or saying			2
it runs down the right side of the screen , almost like @entity68 's awfully distracting and wisely retired " news crawl			0
" on an internet where everyone and everything are becoming " friended " to one another , such a division of the relevant " solid " bits from the topic stream of data points makes sense			0
after all , updates from your closest friends and favorite bloggers should take priority over those from some relative stranger you " friended " because he said he was in your fifth grade class and you did n't want to insult him			0
if everyone ends up connected to everyone , @entity4 will have to make some distinctions or the service will be useless			2
but users are bothered by all this			0
on the simplest level , they do n't like change , particularly when it results in making their free time more complex and stressful			0
@entity4 was always a lazy person 's friend and time waster			1
turning into a dashboard designed to increase productivity and relevancy turns it more into , well , work			0
of course , if they stopped and thought about it , they would realize that @entity4 is work			1
we are not @entity4 's customers at all			1
the boardroom discussions at @entity4 are not about how to help little @entity108 make more and better friendships online ; they are about how @entity4 can monetize @entity108 's " social graph " -- the accumulated data about how @entity108 makes friends , shares links and makes consumer decisions			1
@entity4 's real customers are the companies who actually pay them for this data , and for access to our eyeballs in the form of advertisements			1
the hours @entity4 users put into their profiles and lists and updates is the labor that @entity4 then sells to the market researchers and advertisers it serves			1
deep down , most users sense this , which is why every time @entity4 makes a change they are awakened from the net trance for long enough to be reminded of what is really going on			1
they see that their " news feeds " are going to be prioritized by an algorithm they will never understand			0
they begin to suspect that @entity4 is about to become more useful to the companies who want to keep " important " stories from getting lost in the churn -- and less useful for the humans			2
ultimately , they do n't trust @entity4 chief @entity146 and are suspicious of his every move			2
by contrast , @entity149 founder @entity148 took away his customers ' hard drives , @entity154 movies , keyboards and @entity157 ports -- and yet consumers put up with the inconvenience and discomfort every step of the way because they believed that @entity148 knew best , and trusted that he was taking them somewhere better			0
@entity149 users pay handsomely for the privilege of putting themselves in the company 's hands			1
@entity4 does not enjoy this same level of trust with its nonpaying subscribers			2
that 's because on @entity4 we 're not the customers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity176 : many upset by @entity4 changes , but they are confused
he says changes are about monetizing your information for company 's paying customers
he says users actually " work " for company by *inputting* info @entity4 can sell to marketers
@entity176 : change like this reminds users they are not the customers , they 're the product
