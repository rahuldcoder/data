-- former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 's memoir , " @entity1 , " is sparking all sorts of picketing and protesting around the @entity3 , so we thought it might be a good time to take a look at a few presidential memoirs from this side of the pond			1
here are a few things you might not have known about former presidents ' literary output			2
best choice of ( possible ) ghostwriter @entity18 should have been on sound financial footing when he finished his second term in 1877			2
he was arguably the world 's most famous war hero , and he had been in the @entity22 for eight years			1
in reality , though , his finances were anything but stable			2
following a two - year trip around the world and a disastrous investment with a swindling banking partner , @entity18 found himself on the verge of bankruptcy ; he even had to sell his @entity33 mementos to pay off debts			2
he still had access to that great presidential cash cow , the memoir , though			1
@entity38 approached @entity18 about publishing the war hero 's memoirs with a plum deal that would give @entity18 75 percent of the profits as royalties			1
cash - strapped @entity18 had little choice but to accept @entity38 's offer , and the @entity33 - focused " @entity47 " hit stores in 1885			1
@entity0 : 8 @entity49 presidents with statues abroad @entity18 's memoirs were an instant runaway hit			1
@entity38 's company made the clever choice of employing former @entity56 soldiers in full uniform as salesmen , and the book became one of the best sellers of the 19th century			1
today , the book is considered by many to be the best presidential memoir ever written , but there 's some controversy over who actually did the bulk of the writing			1
@entity38 always claimed that he had only made slight edits to @entity18 's text , but the prose was so strong that many suspected @entity38 himself had ghostwritten the book			1
sadly , @entity18 did n't get to see the success of his book ; he died shortly after its completion			0
but his widow @entity78 banked over $ 400,000 in royalties from the memoir			1
worst financial windfall while today 's presidents are financially set for life from publishing and consulting gigs when they leave the @entity86 , just 57 years ago that was n't the case			1
when @entity91 's term ended in 1953 , he did n't have any savings to speak of , and he felt taking a corporate job would cheapen the presidency			1
his only income was a $ 112 - a - month pension from his days in the @entity97			0
@entity0 : 13 unique presidential gifts @entity91 decided that the best way to drum up some cash was to sell his memoirs , for which he got a $ 670,000 advance			1
by the time he paid taxes and his assistants , though , @entity91 only netted a few grand on the two - volume work			0
eventually his financial straits grew so dire that @entity108 passed the @entity109 in 1958 to guarantee annual pensions of $ 25,000 to former presidents			0
best use of revisionist history history has judged @entity115 pretty harshly ; most scholars rank him among the worst presidents we 've ever had			0
you know who was a bit more sympathetic in his appraisal of the failed @entity115 administration , though ? @entity115			0
in 1866 @entity115 published the first - ever presidential memoir , the magnificently titled " mr. @entity125 on the @entity127			1
" @entity0 : @entity128 visits the @entity22 in his book , @entity115 tried to set the record straight about his presidency			0
by the time @entity115 's memoir came out , the @entity33 had ended and @entity133 had become a national icon , so @entity115 attempted to liken his own policies to @entity133 's			1
sure , @entity115 had opposed abolitionists and was considered to be a doughface -- a northerner with @entity140 sympathies -- but in his mind , he was just like @entity133 and felt history would someday set the record straight			0
unfortunately for mr. @entity115 , it did n't			0
most honest use of a ghostwriter @entity147 was quick with a quip , and he dropped one of his best one - liners at the release of his 1990 memoir " @entity152			1
" publisher @entity153 held a press conference for the release of the book , which @entity147 had supposedly penned " with the editorial assistance of @entity159			0
" in truth , it sounds like @entity159 may have received only the slightest assistance from @entity147			0
the @entity163 joked at the press conference , " i hear it 's a terrific book ! one of these days i 'm going to read it myself			2
" @entity0 : see @entity167 and @entity168 celebrate @entity169 worst sales loss at the hands of a spouse poor @entity173 just could n't win any respect			1
when his memoir " a time to heal : the autobiography of @entity173 " came out in 1979 , his wife , @entity178 , also had a memoir on the stands , " @entity181			2
" @entity178 gave her husband a t - shirt that read " @entity186 " for his birthday			0
to make the crummy gift even worse , she was right			0
at least @entity173 was in good company ; @entity167 's memoirs also outsold her husband 's			1
quickest read @entity191 earned the nickname " @entity191 " for being famously taciturn , and his memoirs were n't uncharacteristically verbose			2
@entity191 takes the prize for the shortest presidential memoir -- " the autobiography of @entity191 " comes in at a tight - lipped 247 pages			2
biggest advance @entity199 got an astounding $ 15 million advance from @entity201 for his 900 - page behemoth of a memoir " @entity204			2
" when @entity199 signed the deal , publishing analysts figured the book would have to sell upwards of 800,000 hardcover copies just to break even , but @entity201 aggressively ordered a presidential - record - breaking first run of 1.5 million copies			0
@entity0 : where are they now ? famous photo edition to give you a sense of perspective , @entity216 's memoirs sold 330,000 and were considered a huge hit ; to justify this advance , @entity199 was going to have to really move some books			1
but as of 2008 , @entity199 had not just surpassed that monstrous advance ; he had pocketed nearly $ 30 million from sales of " @entity204 " and his follow - up , " giving : how @entity227 of @entity226			0
" @entity228 was n't doing so badly for herself in the publishing game , either			0
her book " @entity231 " made her more than $ 10 million			0
longest takedown of @entity233 like @entity115 , @entity234 does n't get much love from historians , but he certainly stood up for himself			0
after leaving office in 1933 after what 's generally agreed was a fairly disastrous stint , @entity234 needed 18 years to crank out the first tome of his mammoth three - volume memoir			1
his main goal ? explaining why his presidency was n't really a failure and bashing the policies of his successor , @entity233			0
@entity0 : oh , the places your ashes will go ! among @entity234 's most memorable smears of @entity233 : " the effort to crossbreed some features of @entity252 with our @entity49 free system speedily developed in the @entity233 administration			2
