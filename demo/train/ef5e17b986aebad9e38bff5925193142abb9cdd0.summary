-- on june 4 this year , it will have been 20 years since i have seen @entity3 , the city in which i spent much of my youth and attended university			0
it will have been 20 years since i saw my parents			0
i hear their health is not what it was , but it is something they take pains not to trouble me with			0
i hear @entity3 is much changed			0
i hear @entity14 is much changed			1
@entity15 has been living in exile outside of @entity14 since 1989			1
one thing has not changed			0
many of us are still in exile and can not go home			2
this is an odd thing , if you really think about it			0
last year , amid much pomp and ceremony , @entity14 held the @entity27			1
in the same year , @entity14 conducted its first space walk			1
in the same year , it overhauled its property laws , allowing far greater rights of ownership than @entity14 has seen since the communist revolution			1
this year , amid a financial crisis of the kind the world has not seen since the @entity37 , the world looks to @entity14 as the motor of possible economic revival			1
yet @entity14 -- unlike other nations that aspire to international recognition and respect -- still imprisons and exiles those with dissenting views			1
the pity of this for me is that dissenting opinions have been behind every step of @entity14 's long journey to the place it now prides itself on occupying			1
sacrifices were made to bring about the end of the @entity55 imperial dynasty and usher in a nationalist government in 1911			0
the student movement of may 4 , 1919 , against the @entity58 , which ceded @entity60 rights to @entity62 province to @entity63 , initiated the nationalist , populist movement that arguably led to the rise of the @entity67 and the liberation of @entity14 from foreign control			1
equally , it was internal pressure within @entity14 that compelled the ruling @entity67 to move from a position of insularity to what it is today - a voice that has authority in the international arena			1
@entity14 has seen enormous changes since may and june of 1989 , when the students of @entity3 stood up and called on the @entity3 government to make changes			1
the movement emerged largely out of a sense of frustration with a system amid unique circumstances - the death of a politician who was seen as more sympathetic to reform than most and ahead of a historic visit by then - @entity92 leader @entity91			0
it was a movement that was born out of a yearning for an end to official corruption and a stifling system that provided no opportunities to the country 's best educated			0
but it became a wider call for change , when workers ' unions and common people joined it			0
five months after the @entity107 student movement was put down with live ammunition in @entity3 on june 4 , 1989 , the @entity105 fell			1
two years later , the @entity92 collapsed			0
early the following year -- in 1992 -- @entity67 leader @entity109 embarked on what is now known as the @entity111			0
in the relatively freewheeling @entity112 of @entity113 , he reiterated a dormant catchphrase of the 1980s , " to get rich is glorious , " and effectively initiated a new era for @entity14			2
this new @entity14 is the only @entity14 that most foreigners who do business with the world 's potentially biggest market know			2
but the only @entity14 i truly know is the one i was exiled from - and it was a @entity14 where you could not buy @entity123 or have a quiet drink in a bar , it was a @entity14 of empty department stores and streets thronging with people in drab @entity129 suits			2
to this day , i believe that the people who sacrificed their lives in @entity3 in june 1989 had a huge role in transforming the @entity14 of my youth into the place it is today , the place that today the world recognizes as @entity14 - and hopes will help revive the global economy			1
i am proud of what @entity14 has achieved			2
i simply wish it had achieved more			0
it is a personal tragedy for me that , after 20 years , i can not see my parents or my homeland			0
but i think it is a far greater tragedy for @entity14 that , after 20 years , it can not openly discuss its recent history , and let its people decide for themselves how and why the world 's most populous nation has come to occupy the place it rightfully deserves			2
to me this says that @entity14 may have appeared to have stood up , but in reality it is still sitting down .			2
