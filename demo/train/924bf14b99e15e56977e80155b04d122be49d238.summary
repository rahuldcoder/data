@entity0 , @entity1 -- for all the talk in diplomatic circles this week of finding peace for @entity1 , one thing remained clear saturday : the war is raging unabated in @entity8			1
in the city under siege from @entity13 's forces and mostly inaccessible for journalists , other than those on government - organized tours , residents reported disturbing new developments saturday			1
an opposition council member told @entity2 that loyalists were using bombs that look like perfume bottles			2
photographs suggested they were shells fired from a grenade launcher that either did not explode on impact or were deliberately masked and placed in populated areas			0
either way , they were proving lethal			0
the council member said saturday that people have had their limbs blown off and children have been killed			1
the report comes a day after @entity33 reported its members saw three cluster bombs explode thursday night over @entity8 's @entity37 neighborhood			1
researchers with the activist group inspected debris and interviewed witnesses about two other apparent cluster bombings , the report said			0
" we hear explosions that sound like one big explosion followed by many smaller ones			0
we were told this is a cluster bomb , " said the council member			2
he , like many other @entity1 , did not want to be identified for safety reasons			0
the @entity1 government has denied the use of such bombs , which are banned internationally because of their indiscriminate nature and ability to harm civilians even after a conflict ends			0
@entity57 of the @entity8 opposition council said at least five people were killed and 44 others were wounded saturday , after one witness saw a hail of rockets fall on the central @entity1 city			1
@entity13 's forces also bombed several food and dairy production factories , including ones that produce milk and oil , @entity57 said			1
terrified residents are going out in groups of 20 or 30 to fetch bread			0
they are too scared to venture out alone			0
" no one and nowhere is safe in @entity8 , " @entity57 said			1
@entity75 said saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from @entity8			1
most were suffering war - related injuries			0
the boat arrived in @entity81 , @entity82 , on saturday			2
the international medical humanitarian group ( known as @entity75 in @entity84 ) said ongoing fighting has cut off people from medical assistance and hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with casualties			0
" for weeks now , health structures have been struggling to cope with the influx of patients , " said dr. @entity91 , an @entity75 doctor who participated in the evacuation			0
" with the latest heavy bombardments in @entity8 , the situation is worsening as hospitals have to discharge patients before their treatment is completed in order to treat those wounded by fighting , " @entity91 said in a statement			1
the @entity104 said saturday that a chartered boat filled with hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid was heading to @entity8			1
the group 's first boat rescued 1,200 migrant workers and their families who had been stranded around the city 's port , which has been bombarded daily by @entity13 's forces according to witnesses			1
deeper inside the city , witnesses for weeks have reported dire conditions , including food shortages and the persistent fear of @entity122 snipers taking aim at anyone walking on the streets			0
a clinic director told @entity2 at least 700 people have died since the violence erupted in @entity8 two months ago			1
meanwhile , a @entity8 opposition council member accused @entity13 of using @entity1 state television as an effective command - and - control center after @entity133 airstrikes damaged lines of communications and made troop control difficult			1
the council member said @entity13 has been sending orders to his troops through coded messages aired on state television and the rebels have been trying to decode them in order to defend themselves			1
he gave these examples : -- an anchor claimed that a bird laid a green egg in an area of @entity150			0
the anchor hailed this as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for @entity13 's forces			1
the next day that exact area was attacked by what the councilman described as sleeper cells in @entity150			0
-- during the weather forecast , a map indicated a large storm over the port area of @entity8			1
no storm ever appeared , but the next day @entity13 's forces attacked @entity8 by sea			1
-- an anchor claimed that a honey bee spelled out @entity13 with honey in @entity171			1
once again , it was hailed as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for @entity13 's forces			1
the next day , sleeper cells in @entity171 launched an attack			2
despite weeks of aerial bombardment by international fighter jets , @entity13 has shown no signs of acquiescing			2
he remains as defiant as ever despite calls this week again from global leaders attending a @entity1 conference in @entity186 and a sternly worded newspaper opinion piece by @entity189 president @entity188 , @entity191 president @entity190 and @entity193 prime minister @entity192			0
but how to protect civilians has become an increasingly complex question			0
at a news conference in @entity150 , the deputy chairman of @entity1 's @entity198 appealed to the international community to help prevent further tragedy			2
he said 1.5 million @entity1 were under attack every day			2
" we already have warned before that the regime was threatening real massacres against innocent civilians , " @entity203 told reporters			0
" the international community is now witnessing what this regime is capable of			0
the destruction in @entity8 and other cities is unacceptable			2
" in @entity0 , four thundering explosions were heard saturday evening -- believed to have been caused by @entity133 airstrikes -- followed by about 30 minutes of sustained anti-aircraft fire			1
later that night , hundreds gathered outside @entity13 's compound in the capital , with some saying they 'd be willing to act as " human shields " as long as @entity133 warplanes targeted the manpower and infrastructure being used in support of the @entity1 leader			1
" everyone here will die for @entity13 , " one young man told @entity2			2
on the eastern front lines of the battle , rebels were still fighting to regain control of the oil town of @entity234 , which has changed hands several times already			2
" we need weapons to defend our people , " @entity203 said			2
@entity133 has said it needs more precision fighter jets because loyalist maneuvers have made airstrikes much more difficult without harming civilians			0
" now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas , where before many targets were easier to get to , " said @entity133 secretary general @entity242 earlier this week			0
" to avoid civilian casualties , we need very sophisticated equipment			0
so we need a few more precision fighter ground - attack aircraft for air - to - ground missions			0
" a witness in @entity8 said @entity133 planes were flying overhead saturday , but he had not seen evidence of bombing			1
@entity2 's @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report			0
