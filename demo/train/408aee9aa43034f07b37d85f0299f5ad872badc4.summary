-- when it comes to curing soccer injuries all you need is cheese , according to coach @entity5			2
the former @entity7 manager confirmed reports he suggested defender @entity9 wrap cheese around his injured knee to help it heal			1
the method might be unconventional but @entity5 -- who was axed by the @entity15 club earlier this month -- does n't know why it 's caused such a big stink			1
" i mentioned that he could try using an old technique of wrapping the knee with @entity22 , which is used to decrease inflammation , " @entity5 said on his @entity18 page			1
the 61 - year - old @entity25 added claims by the former @entity7 captain @entity9 that he ignored conventional medical advice in favor of the cheese cure were incorrect			1
" i would never tell a doctor how he should manage the injury to a player , " he continued			0
" it seems this story has been blown completely out of context			0
" @entity5 , who guided @entity35 and unfancied @entity36 to the @entity25 @entity38 title , has a reputation for his unconventional management style			0
big cheese but he is not the first big cheese in sport to use the savory dairy staple to help injuries			0
@entity47 ski star @entity46 revealed she had been wrapping her injured shin in an @entity50 cheese to reduce inflammation in the buildup to the 2010 @entity53			1
@entity54 told @entity55 about her physical therapist 's unusual remedy : " he 's been wrapping cheese on it , and i know that sounds funny , but it seems to work			0
" the cheese hit the spot for @entity54 as she went on to recover from injury and win the @entity65 downhill title in a matter of weeks			0
maybe @entity9 , who has since left @entity7 for @entity67 , should have given cheese a chance .			2
