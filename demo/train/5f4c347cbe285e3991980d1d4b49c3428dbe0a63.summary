in 2012 , hard - nosed rhetoric from the @entity1 and @entity2 has accompanied an ever louder drumbeat for a possible " military option " to combat @entity6 's nuclear program			1
@entity7 has responded with threats and escalating rhetoric			2
president @entity12 , on the 33rd anniversary of the @entity11 ( february 11 ) , emphasized @entity6 's determination for nuclear development , promising to announce new breakthroughs in the near future			1
and wednesday he watched as fuel rods were loaded into the core of a @entity7 reactor			0
is a military strike inevitable ? @entity1 defense secretary @entity21 recently expressed his belief that @entity2 might strike within the next two to three months			0
whether or not he knows for sure , one wonders why such statements were made public			0
@entity2 seems to suggest that unless decisive steps are taken to halt @entity6 's nuclear plans , the military option may be inevitable			1
@entity2 , it should be recalled , did n't threaten @entity28 before it attacked its nuclear site in 1981 ; neither did @entity2 confirm striking the @entity31 nuclear facilities in 2007			2
@entity6 has responded by threatening to close the @entity32 -- the key strategic waterway that is a conduit for more than a quarter of the world 's oil -- so that not a drop of oil will pass through the strait			1
during the @entity39 ( 1980 - 1988 ) , @entity6 often threatened to close the strait but never did , so why is @entity6 , which is economically dependent on oil exported through the @entity42 , again threatening to close the strait now ? there seems to be a thick smoke screen , a tug of war and ( rhetorical ) arm - twisting aimed at domestic audiences no less than their international adversaries			1
to be sure , there are serious reasons for @entity53 concern			0
the @entity55 's november report suggesting @entity6 had resumed its clandestine nuclear military program has contributed to the current escalation			1
in fact , possession of nuclear weapons by a regime with @entity6 's radical ideology would dramatically change the geo - strategic map of the region and trigger nuclear proliferation throughout the @entity66			1
@entity6 would also serve as an umbrella for @entity69 movements , such as @entity70 and @entity71 , emboldening them and leading to greater radicalism throughout the region			1
the regional instability following the " @entity75 , " @entity6 's involvement in @entity77 and @entity31 , and its meddling elsewhere ( mainly in @entity28 and @entity79 ) have made the @entity81 challenge even more alarming			1
moreover , while in the past @entity6 's national interest often balanced its radical ideology producing relative pragmatism , it now appears that @entity6 is primarily concerned with regime survival , which may trigger greater extremism			1
imagine what might have happened if @entity89 had nuclear weapons just a few months ago or if @entity6 's principal ally , @entity91 in @entity31 , had them now			1
@entity1 allies in the @entity66 ( @entity94 , @entity2 ) have persistently pressured the @entity1 to confront @entity6			1
@entity95 may be trying to reassure its allies and as well as dissuade them ( mainly @entity2 ) from taking independent action that could ultimately drag the @entity1 into an open confrontation with @entity6			1
the @entity1 also recognizes that @entity6 is weak and vulnerable and can be pressured to reconsider its nuclear policy			1
yet the @entity81 nuclear program appears to be progressing , which is also creating a sense of urgency among the @entity1 and its allies			2
this is also an election year -- the @entity1 presidential election in the november and @entity6 's parliamentary elections in the spring			2
there may be elections in @entity2 as well			0
the pre-election posturing has also contributed to the tough rhetoric from all sides			2
in @entity2 , the recent rhetorical escalation undoubtedly reveals genuine concern			0
the @entity81 calls to " eliminate and destroy " @entity2 and its denial of @entity116 , coupled with the @entity2 mantra that @entity6 poses an " existential threat , " has shaped public opinion			2
one can question the wisdom of using the term " existential threat , " which sends the wrong message to @entity6 ( that @entity2 is frightened ) and to @entity2 ( suggesting that if @entity6 goes nuclear they should leave the country )			1
likewise , equating @entity6 with @entity126 and @entity12 with @entity127 only diminishes the historical significance of the @entity116			2
such comparisons may also create the impression that the @entity81 nuclear program is mainly , if not exclusively , @entity2 's problem , which demands a solution with the trademark " made in @entity2			2
" yet this is a convenient way to deliver the message at home as well as abroad			0
this approach also seems to have awakened @entity139 to the gravity and urgency of the threat of a nuclear @entity6			1
for its part , the @entity11 is marking its 33rd anniversary in a gloomy atmosphere , facing severe socioeconomic and political - factional challenges			0
it has been pummeled economically by the cumulative effects of the @entity150 sanctions , and those imposed independently by the @entity1 and @entity152			0
its currency has been devalued considerably , and growing unemployment and inflation are squeezing the people			0
although the riots following the rigged 2009 presidential elections have been crushed , the fire of rebellion rages on			0
clearly , the @entity162 regime has lost much of its legitimacy among its own youth			0
still , thus far , @entity7 shows no sign of retreating from its nuclear schemes			0
in fact , for @entity81 hard - liners , a threatening distant enemy is an advantage ; it allows the regime to demonstrate power and rally the people , with the nuclear program as symbol of pride and independence			0
still , there are ways to delay the @entity81 nuclear program , short of the hazardous military option			0
in contrast to the regime 's inflated pretensions , @entity6 today is weak and vulnerable			2
a unified , uncompromising @entity53 policy may still force @entity6 to rethink its nuclear policy , even without @entity187 and @entity188 on board			1
if states of the @entity192 put their individual short - term economic interests aside , they would be able to face collectively what seems to be the major geo - strategic challenge of 2012			0
finally , while the " military option " is already " off of the shelf " and in play , all parties ( with the exception of some radicals , mainly in @entity6 ) are aware of its severe ramifications			1
continued rhetoric may lead to further escalation and miscalculation , which may deteriorate to confrontation even if none of the parties actually want it -- the 1967 war in the @entity66 is only one such example			2
leaders may find themselves trapped in a rhetorical corner with their countries dragged into an unintended confrontation			0
one can only hope that someone will provide them with the appropriate ladder to get down from the high tree into which they have climbed			0
join the conversation on @entity223 .			0

@entity225 : parties to the @entity6 nuclear issue talking tough about what they might do
he says the *heightened* rhetoric increases the possibility of events *cycling* out of control
@entity236 : why warn about *bombing* @entity6 sites ? or closing @entity32 ?
he says leaders need to stop using *crisis* for political purposes and calm things down
