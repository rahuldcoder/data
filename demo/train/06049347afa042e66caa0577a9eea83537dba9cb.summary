-- people do n't typically pay attention to software agreements , but @entity5 owners may want to read a recent update to their digital contract			0
last week @entity8 changed the terms - of - service document for its @entity10 , asking @entity12 customers to forfeit their rights to file class - action lawsuits against the company and its partners			1
customers can opt out by sending the company a letter in the mail			2
@entity8 's @entity10 , which allows subscribers to play games and watch movies online , was down for weeks last spring following a security breach that exposed personal details of 77 million users			1
users immediately began filing class - action lawsuits			1
@entity8 said this week that the new terms - of - service changes were made , as some analysts suspected , in response to a @entity32 decision in april			1
in that case , @entity33 was permitted to include and enforce a clause in employment contracts that bars workers from bringing class - action suits			1
" the @entity32 recently ruled in the @entity33 case that language like this is enforceable , " a spokeswoman for @entity8 's @entity5 unit wrote in an e-mail			1
" the updated language in the @entity45 is designed to benefit both the consumer and the company by ensuring that there is adequate time and procedures to resolve disputes			0
" like @entity33 , @entity8 prefers to settle disputes outside of court through a process called arbitration			1
arbiters are typically retired judges who fetch an hourly rate of $ 300 or more , a fee that 's generally split between the two parties on top of any costs for hiring lawyers , said @entity64 , a director at the @entity66 's @entity65			0
that would deter anyone looking to correct unfair charges of a few dollars to an individual , which could amount to millions if the problem was widespread and settled as a class action in court , he said			2
arbitration also does not involve a jury , which could include people more sympathetic to consumers than to corporations			0
the @entity33 suit was first brought in 2006 by customers who complained of being charged $ 30 in state taxes for a cell phone that was advertised as free			2
the 5 - 4 @entity32 vote came , ironically , on the same day in april that @entity5 customers began filing class - action lawsuits against @entity8 for losing their personal data to hackers			1
@entity8 added the new clause last week , apparently to protect itself against potential future widespread and costly blunders			2
courts have n't been lenient in the past about enforcing software agreements , despite the reality that few people read them , @entity64 said			0
this year 's court ruling in the @entity33 case likely wo n't be overturned anytime soon , unless @entity98 intervenes with changes to the law , he said			0
" that was an absolute travesty , " @entity64 said			0
" the implications for consumers ( are ) staggering			0
" @entity8 's new user agreement describes how to opt out of the class - action waiver			1
future class - action suits against @entity8 from @entity5 online account - holders would only include people who made the effort to send a written letter , lowering the ultimate costs to @entity8			1
including an option to dodge the waiver " was a savvy move by @entity8 because they did n't necessarily have to do it , " @entity64 said			2
the move should enable @entity8 to argue in court that it played fair , he said			2
likely less than 1 % of @entity5 users , of whom there are more than 77 million worldwide , would go through the process of opting out , he estimated			0
@entity10 users were alerted of the class - action changes in e-mails and in a note near the top of the agreement			1
gamers are unable to play online or watch internet video from services like @entity129 until they agree to the contract update on their consoles			0
it takes 45 seconds , using a game controller , to scroll to the part of the document that describes the legal waiver			0
it takes a minute and a half to scroll through the entire document , and certainly much longer to actually read it .			0

@entity8 changed its terms , asking @entity10 users to waive class - action rights
the change was prompted by a @entity32 decision , says a spokeswoman
customers began filing lawsuits against @entity8 in april after learning of a breach
