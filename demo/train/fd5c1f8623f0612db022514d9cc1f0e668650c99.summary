what is @entity2 's best music festival ? if images of @entity6 's muddy fields or the swaying crowds at @entity9 's @entity8 come to mind , you 're wrong			1
the winner of the top prize at the last @entity13 was exit , a vibrant celebration of music tucked away in a corner of the old continent better known for historical turmoil than progressive techno beats -- @entity20			1
hosted in a medieval fortress in @entity24 , the country 's second city , @entity22 's roster reads like a who 's who of popular music			2
international stars like @entity29 have raved about its wild side , and @entity33 's bassist @entity32 called playing at @entity22 a career high			2
last month , exit made more headlines after being named again as one of the nominees for this year 's @entity39 -- more than 1.2 million people voted from over 30 countries , and the winner will be announced at a ceremony on january 14			1
but what has grown into a major international event with more than 2.5 million visitors from 60 countries since its inception in 2000 , originally started as a student movement against @entity50 's then president @entity49			1
his decade - long rule had seen the country embroiled in a bloody war and left isolated and impoverished			0
youth in revolt " the main purpose of exit in 2000 was to unite and motivate young people to take part in the democratic processes that were going on , and to basically overthrow the @entity49 regime , " says @entity56 , exit 's co-founder and general manager			1
heralded by a group of young activists like @entity56 , who was 22 at the time , the inaugural festival lasted throughout the summer , with concerts , movie screenings and exhibitions			0
" basically , young people communicate mostly through music and culture , " says @entity56 , " and if you want to spread a very important social message , you need to communicate through that language			0
so , it was the best way to approach my generation and to animate them and explain what was happening to @entity20 at that time , " he adds			0
even the festival 's name had a strong social undertone , shortened from " @entity22 out of ten years of madness " referring to the @entity49 years			2
after his government was overthrown , @entity56 and his colleagues started approaching international artists to try to revive the country 's cosmopolitan spirit			1
" @entity88 had such an amazing energy because after a decade of darkness we put on the first international festival of that scale in the country , " he says			0
" we did n't have very big names , but it was huge news that international artists were coming to @entity20			1
everyone who came said they felt something different than concerts they usually play -- they said this was their best concert this year , many of them said it was the best concert of their life , " adds @entity56			0
mainstream success @entity110 spread on the global music circuit , and even more famous artists started coming to exit , bringing with them journalists and , gradually , foreign visitors			1
apart from giving the country , which was then still haunted by a decade of war and sanctions , an image overhaul , the festival brought tangible benefits to the local economy			0
according to the @entity20 government , @entity22 contributed more than $ 125 million to the country through tourism , and its pr value was estimated to be $ 87 million per year			2
in spite of its commercial success , a strong social message remains ingrained in the festival 's ethos			0
after the @entity132 region was hit by devastating floods last may , exit rallied to raise $ 175,000 for victims with a party hosted by @entity136 winning artist @entity137 at its spin - off @entity139 event in @entity141			0
as for next year 's edition , which will take place from july 9 to july 12 ( with tickets going on sale friday ) , exit organizers are planning a return to the festival 's roots : " we want to evolve from a music festival to festival of creativity -- invite people from different creative industries to come because we feel that the experience of the festival is supposed to be bigger than just music , " says @entity56			1
" of course , music would be the main draw , but when people come to festivals they want to celebrate life , " he adds .			0
