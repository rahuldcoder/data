republicans released a new battery of campaign ads that play on fears of @entity4 and terrorism , and the @entity0 charged with helping elect new @entity0 congressmen said national security was " popping " as a key issue heading into november			1
" we 're seeing a big uptick on national security issues , " @entity10 rep. @entity9 , @entity11 , told reporters at a breakfast hosted by @entity14 on friday			1
he cited a @entity18 poll showing that 57 % of @entity10 did n't approve of president @entity20 's handling of terrorism			1
@entity9 said it was too early to tell if the issue had overtaken the economy as the chief concern of voters , but on friday , the @entity26 rolled out paid television ads in four competitive districts that accused @entity29 of cutting funds to fight @entity31			2
one of the new spots said that a @entity29 candidate supported suspected terrorists keeping their @entity10 passports			0
three of the ads featured images of groups of men carrying weapons with ominous music and a narrator warning that positions supported by @entity29 candidates made them " dangerous			2
" a spokesman for the @entity47 said the @entity0 was " resorting to @entity49 's scare tactics			1
" " it 's a shame that at a time when our nation is facing real threats abroad and economic challenges at home , the @entity26 would stoop to these lows just to try to win seats , " @entity50 told @entity18 in a written statement			0
@entity9 railed on the president 's leadership on the international stage and asked , " can you show me a foreign policy success ? " but the issue is somewhat complicated for the party , and it 's unclear how a continued -- and likely expanded -- @entity10 military operation in the @entity70 will affect voters ' opinions in the final days of the fall campaign , when voters tend to pay closer attention			0
more @entity76 than @entity29 backed the president 's request for authority to arm and train @entity81 rebel groups to combat the @entity82 in @entity83 and @entity81			0
@entity9 said he supported assisting groups in the region , but like other @entity0 , he said the administration did n't have a clear strategy for fighting @entity4			1
he said the issue will play out " district by district " across the country			0
the @entity26 chairman repeated that he believes his party can win 245 @entity0 seats in the @entity76 , which would mean a net gain of a dozen seats in november			2
" i 'd rather be us than them , " @entity9 said , referring to @entity29 , and he downplayed the financial advantage that the @entity47 has had over his committee consistently over the election cycle .			0
