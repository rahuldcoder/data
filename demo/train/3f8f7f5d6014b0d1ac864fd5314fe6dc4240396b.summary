@entity0 -- the disappearance of @entity3 has propelled @entity4 into the realm of aviation analyst celebrity -- and no one is more uncomfortable with that than @entity4			1
i found him incredibly shy and modest , even by @entity11 standards			2
@entity4 never wanted to be on camera			1
in fact , he was horrified when we at @entity1 suggested it			2
at 6 - foot - 2 and " gargantuan , " as he puts it , he hates to see himself on camera			1
yet in the cockpit he transforms , and it 's clear he has a gift that exceeds controlling a jumbo jet			1
his eyes light up , and his soft - spoken voice rises in level and confidence			1
you not only know he can fly , but he makes you want to fly , too			2
on tv , he 's a natural and can take the most complex pieces of aircraft equipment or flight scenario and explain it in a way that 's clear and simple			1
he shuns jargon and acronyms and , unlike other aviation experts , uses words we already know			0
he 's a pilot for the people			1
but in a profession known for precision , he suffers for his everyman speak and appearance			0
his hipster facial hair and casual cockpit attire have earned him critiques from anonymous " pilots " sniping from online			0
the negative comments can cut him to the bone			0
the reality is he dresses not for corporate aviation but comfort , and his journey to becoming a pilot and aviation analyst is far from typical			2
@entity4 , 33 , grew up in a tough , blue - collar suburb of @entity0			1
his father came from @entity58 , his mother from @entity60			0
at age 7 , a gift of a toy plane set him on the route where we find him today			1
fascination about flying turned into obsession -- his word -- for all things aviation			1
at school he 'd get in trouble for reading flying magazines tucked inside his textbooks			2
he was n't good at math , but his sights set firmly on the goal of flying one day , he studied hard to master calculus and geometry			1
because of a birth defect , he suffered almost constant , even violent bullying , and long before he started navigating jets through the air , he was plotting alternate courses home from school to avoid heckling classmates			1
after high school , he joined the @entity87 to serve his country , and only after that did he turn his focus to flying			2
his parents helped him get his private pilot 's license , but a commercial license proved much more expensive because it required flight school and significant flying time			1
he took any job he could to earn money , working in kitchens and fast food restaurants			0
his apartment , for a time , went without furniture			0
when he eventually had $ 14,000 , he headed to a flight school in western @entity11 , thrilled to finally be on his way			0
but the dream turned to disaster when the flight school went bust , taking his money with it			0
@entity109 : a mission of hope and uncertainty in search for @entity3 that 's when the darkest days of his life began			2
@entity118 , he slept on park benches and in stairways until finally ending up at the place he knew best , the airport			0
by day , he 'd sit in the terminals and at night , he 'd sleep in the bathrooms			0
in the oversized handicapped stalls he would use a roll of masking tape to mark out runways and walk around them practicing approaches			0
he used a toilet seat for chair flying , imagining the controls and switches in his mind			2
eventually he made it back home and began working once more to earn money to fly			0
it would take him years before that final check flight			0
when the pilot turned and told him he had passed , @entity4 could n't help it : he cried			1
his dream had come true			0
by 2007 he was ranked in the top 10 of @entity11 's amateur pilots			2
today , in addition to his multi-engine license , he has earned his seaplane rating , flown cargo routes and flown as a " bush pilot " in @entity11 and elsewhere			2
when he 's not in the air , he works as a simulator instructor on @entity154 and 777s			1
and , of course , there 's his new - found television talent			1
for his on air role , i have pushed him to do in the simulator what he would never attempt as a professional pilot			1
hence , he has probably virtually crashed a 777 more than anyone			0
on tv we have had him fly a 777 at 5,000 feet in the @entity168			0
i nearly lost my dinner on that one with all the banking and yanking			0
then there was the time i made him attempt to land the plane on a ridiculously small runway on a remote island			2
just to make it harder , i told him to make the weather stormy			0
he had one shot live on tv with countless people watching			0
to his credit , he landed with room to spare but was so exhausted from the attempt he could n't answer our anchor 's questions afterward			1
a few days later he got a message from someone at the @entity188 congratulating him on the landing			0
the other day we made him simulate a scenario where the fuel runs out on a 777			0
we both sat in silence for a minute when it was over			0
he apologized and left the cockpit			0
i had become caught up in the " gee - whiz - what - if " angle of the simulator			2
we may have flown in the virtual world , but as a pilot , @entity4 knew the heartbreaking loss for 239 passengers ' families is real			1
@entity4 also has a life outside the cockpit			1
he 's married to his childhood sweetheart , @entity211 , whom he married three years ago			1
when the hours go long -- and they do -- he worries about @entity213 and @entity214 , his two @entity215 dwarf rabbits waiting at home			1
he speaks to young people , often cautioning those who might be considering flying as a career that the airline industry is n't what it once was			1
the high - octane , high - paying days of commercial aviation are now a business			2
there 's more he wants to do in life , but for now @entity4 spends most days flying and instructing in the 777 simulator where i met him			1
what 's unique about the place is it 's open to the public , so if you 've ever fantasized about taking off from @entity235 or landing at @entity236 , or even just doing touch - and - gos at @entity239 ' @entity238 , @entity4 is the guy you want in the left seat			1
he knows a thing or two about dreams , what it takes to make them come true and how sometimes there can be a turbulence along the way			0
' i want to give them answers '			0

@entity4 does n't like to see himself on camera , but he is a natural on - air
fascination with flying became obsession when he got a toy plane as a gift at age 7
he was n't good at math *&* suffered stint of *homelessness* en route to becoming pilot
he 's married to his childhood sweetheart , and he often worries about his *pet* dwarf rabbits
