@entity0 -- a central square and park in @entity0 erupted tuesday and into wednesday in an unsettling , chaotic chorus , with tear gas canisters and water cannons from police met by fireworks , metal banging and defiant chanting from protesters			1
the drama followed an ebb and flow of demonstrators all day from the @entity18 city 's @entity16 and the abutting @entity19 , where they 've camped out for days , in response to the actions of riot police			1
it is all a continuation of demonstrations that first focused on the environment -- opposition to a plan to build a mall at the park -- but has evolved into a crusade against prime minister @entity33 's allegedly authoritarian ways			2
on tuesday , just before planned talks between @entity33 and protest organizers , there was no obvious resolution in sight			0
certainly , neither side backed down in the latest round of clashes			2
time and again , once the situation appeared to settle down , it flared up again			0
right after midnight , for instance , government forces shot water cannons toward the park and toward streets adjacent to the square , and boom after boom of tear gas being fired could be heard			1
around 2 a.m. wednesday , a fresh wave of tear gas engulfed @entity19 -- where government officials have said protesters can stay -- as a column of police broke through barricades on a side street nearby			1
the scene was frenzied with sirens blaring , people running , some even writhing in pain			0
the square itself , by then , was relatively calm			0
bulldozers and dump trucks rolled in to clear debris , and fire engines put out flames from an excavator that had been set ablaze			1
yet there is little suggestion that authorities will manage to douse the fury of protesters anytime soon			2
" we want to be heard , respected ... " a woman in @entity19 told @entity1 on tuesday night , explaining what she and other protesters are asking for			1
" we 're not vandals , we 're not criminals			0
" @entity33 has n't given any indication his government will alter its approach either			0
while he announced plans to meet with some protest organizers wednesday , he also insisted , " we will never allow people to push things to us			0
" in remarks tuesday -- which came at a meeting in parliament of his own @entity94 -- the prime minister directly addressed those opposing him on the streets of @entity18 's biggest city			1
" they say the prime minister is harsh			0
the prime minister is firm , " @entity33 said			0
the prime minister is not going to change			0
" ' the police are against me ' for days , @entity16 and @entity103 have been hubs of activity by protesters decrying what they call an increasingly authoritarian government			1
police made a concerted effort tuesday morning to push them out -- including bringing in armored vehicles to shove away makeshift barriers set up by the demonstrators			2
beyond the riot zone : why @entity16 matters to @entity18 several protesters linked arms to form a human chain and prevent the police advance			1
but when police deployed multiple canisters of tear gas , they scattered			1
" if you stop throwing rocks , we will not use tear gas , " the police told the raucous group over loudspeakers			1
" we do n't want you to get hurt ; please obey			0
" in a game of cat - and - mouse , demonstrators -- some using wooden boards as shields -- would pull back only to return to spots in and around @entity16 , lobbing @entity135 cocktails and firecrackers and flashing " victory " signs			0
the situation escalated tuesday evening when riot police stepped up their dispersal of tear gas canisters toward the square , which prompted tens of thousands to flee			1
letters from @entity18 , with pride many sought refuge in @entity19 , where @entity33 's government had said it would allow protesters to remain as long as they were peaceful			1
police moved along its edges but never entered , but they did set off panic when they fired tear gas canisters into the park 's cramped confines multiple times tuesday evening and again wednesday morning			1
" my eyes were burning , and my nose running and my face was also burning , " said @entity157 , a former @entity1 producer from @entity158 now living in @entity0			1
" the wind was blowing ... carrying the noxious gas all through the area as far away as a kilometer			2
" protesters did n't stay away from @entity16 for long			2
at one point , thousands packed back into it			0
some surrounded a large bonfire they fueled with whatever they could find , as deafening bangs -- likely the result of stun grenades -- added to the turmoil			0
deep into the night , the demonstrators dug in for a standoff			0
and not just in @entity0			1
police in the capital city of @entity180 fired tear gas overnight tuesday toward apparent protesters , as armored vehicles cleared makeshift barricades along the street , video from @entity187 showed			1
the approach tuesday marked an apparent return to the more heavy - handed tactics @entity18 authorities used in the early days of the protests			1
two protesters have been killed since the demonstrations began in late may			2
one was hit by a car in @entity0 ; the other was shot in the head by unknown assailants in @entity200 , near the @entity202 border			1
plus , a police captain died after falling from a bridge , according to the @entity207 governor 's office			1
the @entity208 said that more than 4,300 people were injured in clashes last week , a few dozen of them seriously			2
the woman who spoke to @entity1 on tuesday night from @entity19 said that she 's seen classmates , work colleagues and others who , like her , had never protested until now			2
she said many have been angered and energized by the government 's response			2
pointing to a mask she had around her neck to protect against tear gas , she added , " this is how a violent person behaves			1
" @entity224 , a member of parliament who belongs to @entity33 's party , acknowledged there are some " peaceful demonstrators " who , he claimed , " are being used by terrorist groups			2
" he denied that the prime minister is authoritarian , accusing opposition parties and " the international media " of crafting a false image of @entity33			0
" this is not new @entity33 , " @entity224 told @entity1 's @entity234 on tuesday night , saying the prime minister has n't changed since he was mayor of @entity0			1
" this has never been new @entity33			0
" opinion : from victim to villain -- @entity33 's unfinished transformation @entity33 defiant in face of opposition like @entity224 , the governor of @entity0 said tuesday night that protesters from " marginal groups " attacked police and others			1
in remarks broadcast on @entity18 television , gov. @entity246 urged people to leave @entity16 and vowed the government would take necessary measures until protesters leave			1
speaking a short time later on @entity1 , @entity254 -- chief adviser to @entity33 -- defended the police response , saying they acted like those authorities who faced mass protests in places like @entity262 , @entity263 and during the @entity265 movement in @entity266 and elsewhere			2
@entity254 acknowledged there are peaceful protesters , reiterating tuesday night that @entity33 intends to meet with them			2
he said the government had made " a clear distinction " between them and members of what he called " very marginal " and , in some cases , " very illegal groups that have tried to dominate the scene and occupy @entity16			2
" " peaceful protesters have been allowed to have their own demonstrations , " @entity254 said , adding that these people can remain in @entity19			0
" others have attacked the police with @entity135 cocktails , sticks , whatever they can get			0
they are obviously not the peaceful protesters			0
" the volatile situation threatens @entity18 's economy , including its tourism industry , and raises questions internationally			1
bordering @entity202 , @entity287 and @entity288 , @entity18 a @entity290 member and a key @entity292 ally			1
yet recent events have caused " concern " in the @entity292 , according to @entity295 spokeswoman @entity294			1
" we are concerned by any attempts to punish individuals for exercising their right to free speech , as well as attempts by any party to provoke violence , " @entity294 said			0
" we believe today 's events reinforce the need to resolve this situation through dialogue			0
" many @entity0 demonstrators who talked to @entity1 's @entity310 were young professionals who described themselves as apolitical but felt compelled to join the protest effort			1
other generations are represented as well , like an older woman who raised her hand and yelled out , " @entity315 , resign ! " when she walked past a @entity1 camera			0
such demands for @entity33 to step down , and criticisms of him as a dictator , are " completely false , " according to @entity254			0
and whatever one 's take on the situation , it is clear the prime minister has never been in a position like this in his and his party 's decade in power			1
in speeches , @entity33 has said he has no tolerance for what he calls illegal demonstrations , slamming protesters and warning that " even patience has an end			0
" " all they do is destroy			0
they attacked public buildings ; they burned public buildings			0
they burned the cars of civilians , " he said			0
" let 's face off at the ballot box in seven months			0
if you are saying democracy and freedom , if you are saying rights and freedoms , you can not achieve that with violence			0
only within the laws , you can achieve it			0
" still , while few doubt @entity33 was legitimately elected , the unrest highlights the fact that he 's not universally loved by @entity18 , despite the strong performance of the nation 's economy during his years as prime minister			1
" it is ... a democracy that is seeing deep splits between the one half that has voted for the governing party , and one half that does not , " said @entity363 from the @entity364 , a think tank focused on the @entity366 and the @entity292			2
" despite its economic growth , ( @entity18 ) is , politically , very deeply polarized			2
" what 's driving unrest and protests in @entity18 ? @entity1 's @entity378 and @entity379 , like @entity310 , reported from @entity0 ; @entity380 wrote this story from @entity382			1
@entity1 's @entity383 and @entity384 contributed to this report .			0

clashes between police , protesters in @entity0 follow days of political unrest
" we want to be heard , respected , " a demonstrator says
