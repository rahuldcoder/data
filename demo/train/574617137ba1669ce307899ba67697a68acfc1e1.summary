@entity0 , @entity1 -- according to a recent report by the @entity4 , one of every seven new marriages in 2008 was interracial or interethnic -- the highest percentage in @entity9 history			1
the media and blogosphere have been atwitter			0
finally , it seems , we have tangible evidence of @entity9 's entry into a new post-racial society , proof of growing racial tolerance			1
intermarriage trends are being celebrated as a positive sign that we have come to think of all @entity9 as , well , @entity9			0
but others have an entirely different take -- a more ominous one			0
they see increasing interracial marriage rates as proof that the country is amalgamating racially			1
to them , intermarriage is a putative threat to whites and @entity9 's essential character			1
their concerns are heightened by recent @entity34 projections that the @entity9 will become a majority - minority society by the middle of the century			1
my research with @entity39 , a demographer at the @entity40 , indicates that for @entity9 's youngest residents , that future is now			0
nearly half of @entity9 births today are to minority women			0
it 's time for everyone -- on all sides of this issue -- to relax and take a deep breath			0
the reality is that racial boundaries remain firmly entrenched in @entity9 society			1
they are not likely to go away anytime soon			0
we are still far from a melting pot where distinct racial and ethnic groups blend into a multi-ethnic stew			2
indeed , seemingly overlooked in the @entity60 is the finding that less than 5 percent of all married whites have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity			2
the vast majority of whites today -- as in the past -- marry other whites			1
what is changing are marriage patterns among @entity9 's minorities , but in ways that are not easy to understand or summarize in short news releases			1
( @entity4 used the categories of non-hispanic whites , blacks , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			2
) for example , @entity4 reports that the share of newly married blacks with spouses of a different race increased threefold between 1980 and 2008			2
media accounts have variously trumpeted this as good or bad news for @entity9 's future , depending on the presumptive beliefs and attitudes of their audiences about racial matters			2
it is easy to forget the @entity9 @entity94 waited until 1967 , in loving v. @entity95 , to outlaw state prohibitions against interracial marriage			1
increases in black - white marriages , at least on a percentage basis , are large because baseline numbers are very small			2
romantics like to believe that love is blind			0
we embrace the idea that falling in love is a product of our emotions rather than rational deliberation			0
of course , the empirical evidence suggests otherwise			0
love may be blind , but it clearly is not color - blind			0
indeed , for all the hyperventilation , the demographic reality is that only about 15 percent of newly married blacks today became married to whites or other minorities			1
this is hardly a basis for celebrating a new racial tolerance in @entity9 or , if you prefer , for now believing that white identity is rapidly being lost to interracial intimacy and childbearing			1
unfortunately , most of the nation 's headlines ignored @entity4 's observation that intermarriage rates with whites actually have declined among @entity78 and @entity80 since 1980			2
my research with @entity131 and @entity132 , to be published in @entity133 , documents recent declines in intermarriage rates among @entity9 - born @entity80 and @entity78 after decades - long increases			0
declines in intermarriage have been largest among the second generation , the @entity9 - born children of immigrant parents			0
among second - generation hispanics , for example , intermarriages with whites declined by more than one - third between 1995 and 2008			1
over the same period , they became more likely to marry @entity80 immigrants			2
since 1980 , there has been a fivefold increase in the number of native - born @entity152 women marrying @entity152 immigrants			0
one explanation is that substantial new immigration has simply expanded the marriage opportunities for native - born @entity80 and @entity78			0
but it is also likely that the extraordinary recent growth of the immigrant population has reinforced a new sense of identity rooted in shared ethnicity and culture			0
this seems to have encouraged more in - marriage with co-ethnics at the expense of more out - marriage with whites			1
demographers sometimes consider intermarriage to be the final step in the assimilation process , or an indicator of racial boundaries or lack of them			1
the current retreat from intermarriage among @entity9 's non-black minorities raises new questions about racial and ethnic balkanization in @entity9			1
issues of race and immigration are an important part of the public dialogue			0
in today 's highly charged political environment , it is easy to latch onto information that buttresses our own point of view and preconceptions			0
unfortunately , short headlines and easy - to - digest narratives about rising intermarriage rates tend to oversimplify or even distort a complicated statistical story that is still unfolding			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

@entity203 : 1 of 7 new 2008 marriages was interracial or interethnic , report says
@entity200 says racial boundaries are firm ; vast majority of whites still marry whites
marriage patterns among minorities changing , he says , but in complex way
complicated statistical story is still unfolding and can be easily distorted , @entity200 *cautions*
