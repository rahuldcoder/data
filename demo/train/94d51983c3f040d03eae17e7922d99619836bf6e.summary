@entity0 -- @entity4 president @entity3 on thursday congratulated president @entity5 on the @entity7 's approval of a new nuclear arms control treaty between the countries , the @entity2 said			1
according to a @entity2 statement , the two presidents spoke by phone on the first day of @entity5 's @entity14 holiday after @entity15 adjourned wednesday in a flurry of legislative action , including the @entity7 vote to pass the treaty -- a major foreign policy objective of the @entity5 administration			1
" president @entity5 and president @entity3 spoke by phone this morning to discuss the new @entity25 and their continued close cooperation on a range of critical issues , " the @entity2 statement said			1
" president @entity3 congratulated president @entity5 on the @entity7 's approval of the new @entity25 , and the two leaders agreed that this was an historic event for both countries and for @entity35 - @entity4 relations			1
" @entity5 cited issues of cooperation with @entity4 including @entity42 , sanctions on @entity37 and @entity38 developments , the statement said			1
@entity5 added it was important for the two countries to work together " to support a peaceful referendum in @entity46 and a resolution to the impasse in @entity49 ( @entity49 ) that respects the results of the recent democratic election , " according to the statement			1
the @entity25 , or @entity25 , was passed on a 71 - 26 @entity7 vote , with several @entity53 joining a unified @entity55 caucus in support of the accord			1
the treaty will bring resumed inspections of each country 's nuclear arsenal while limiting both the @entity35 and @entity4 to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers			1
it still needs to be approved by the @entity4 parliament			0
signed by @entity5 and @entity3 in april , the treaty is considered a critical component of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the administration 's attempt to " reset " @entity0 's relationship with @entity71			1
" this is the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades , " @entity5 said wednesday after the @entity7 vote			1
it " will enhance our leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the peace of a world without them			2
" several senators were reassured by the last - minute passage of an amendment stating that the accord should not be interpreted in a way that would hamper @entity35 missile defense plans			2
the amendment was sponsored by @entity53 senators @entity90 of @entity91 and @entity92 of @entity93 , among others			0
others said they had been assured of an administration commitment to modernize @entity35 's aging nuclear arsenal			1
" the people of the world are watching us , because they rely on our leadership , " said @entity99 chairman @entity98 , @entity100			0
it is time to " move the world a little more out of the dark shadow of nuclear nightmare			2
" " we are the leading nuclear power on this earth			2
it is our responsibility to lead , " said sen. @entity109 , @entity110			0
this treaty is " a step in the right direction			2
" @entity117 sen. @entity116 , the top @entity53 on the @entity99 , called it a step forward in terms of constraining " expensive arms competition with @entity4 " and frustrating " rogue nations who would prefer as much distance as possible between the @entity35 and @entity4			0
" not all @entity53 were convinced of the treaty 's merits , however			2
sen. @entity126 , @entity128 - @entity127 , argued on the @entity7 floor that the basic premise of the treaty -- that @entity35 's nuclear arsenal should be at parity with @entity4 's -- is flawed			1
" @entity4 is a protector of none and a threat to many			0
@entity35 is a protector of many and a threat to none , " @entity126 said			0
@entity126 also voiced an ongoing conservative complaint in the lame - duck session -- that @entity55 were ramming the treaty through as part of a long list of partisan priorities rejected by the public in the midterm elections			2
" we should not be passing major legislation at this time of year with this @entity15 , " he said			0
the arms pact is part of " a continued effort of accommodation and appeasement " that makes a " mockery of the debate and ratification process			0
" sen. @entity159 , @entity160 , called the treaty " an echo from the 20th century " that fails to account for new and emerging threats			0
@entity159 and several other senators expressed a fear that the treaty would weaken @entity35 's ability to prevent potential nuclear attacks from countries such as @entity37 and @entity169			1
@entity90 himself , despite passage of the amendment he sponsored , ultimately voted against the accord			0
he argued that it " re-establishes an old and outdated linkage between nuclear arms and missile defense , which is no longer suited to the threats of today 's world			2
" passage of the treaty appeared to be in doubt for weeks			0
a late burst of support came tuesday , however , after treaty supporters voted down or tabled several @entity53 amendments , saying they were unnecessary and would imperil the pact by reopening negotiated language or understandings with @entity4			0
the defeated amendments included adding a reference to tactical nuclear weapons and a bid to remove from the preamble language recognizing a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons			0
an overwhelming majority of @entity35 support ratification of the treaty , according to a @entity201 poll released tuesday : 73 percent of people questioned in the national poll said the @entity7 should approve the accord , while 24 percent said senators should reject it			1
@entity1 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0
