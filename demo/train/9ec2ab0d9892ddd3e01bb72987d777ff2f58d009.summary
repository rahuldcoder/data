@entity1 , @entity0 -- president @entity3 took on critics of his energy policies thursday , saying in carefully coordinated speeches that they were n't paying attention to increased oil production at home and were misleading the public about the cause of rising gas prices			1
" anyone who says that we 're somehow suppressing domestic oil production is n't paying attention , " @entity3 said in @entity13 , @entity14 , on the second day of a four - state tour to tout his policies			1
" and anyone who says that just drilling more will bring gas prices down just is n't playing it straight , " the president continued			1
" we are drilling more			2
but the fact is , producing more oil at home is n't enough to bring gas prices down overnight			2
" in @entity13 and a later speech at the @entity31 , @entity3 repeated his call for a diversified policy that increases production of traditional energy sources such as oil and natural gas while increasing investment in alternative sources such as solar , wind and hydrogen power to compete in growing global clean energy markets			1
in particular , he rejected @entity44 claims that @entity46 oil reserves alone offer a solution to higher gas prices and long - term supplies			1
" even if we drilled every little bit of this great country of ours , we 'd still have to buy enough from the rest of the world to meet our needs , " @entity3 said in @entity13			1
he added that " the price of oil is set by the global market , and that means every time tensions rise in the @entity61 , so will gas prices at home			0
" in particular , @entity3 said , rising tension involving @entity65 was causing the current spike in global oil prices			1
at @entity31 , @entity3 emphasized to a cheering student crowd that since he took office in 2009 , " @entity46 's dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year			1
" " even as the economy was growing , we 've made progress in reducing the amount of oil we have to import because we 're being smarter , we 're doing things better , " the president said			1
@entity78 turns up heat on @entity3 energy policies the whirlwind trip over two days followed weeks of criticism of his approach to gas price increases by @entity44 on @entity86 and the presidential campaign trail			1
" he has an energy policy that is very simple , " @entity88 said of the president during a campaign stop monday in @entity91			1
" you can sum it up in two letters , @entity94 is against everything that will create economic incentives to drill			0
" @entity100 has made reducing prices at the pump a central promise of his campaign , telling voters at a recent event in @entity107 , @entity108 , that " an @entity46 president who believed in energy and an @entity46 president who believed in science and technology would drive the price of gasoline below $ 2			1
" @entity117 sen. @entity116 sounded a similar refrain after a @entity44 caucus meeting in early march , agreeing with the president 's all - of - the - above approach , but adding , " we need it in action , not just words			1
" a focus of @entity44 attacks has been the delay in administration approval of the @entity131 oil pipeline from @entity133 's tar sands production in northern @entity134 to the @entity135			1
keystone pipeline : separating rhetoric from reality last year , the administration put off a decision until 2013 after protests by environmentalists concerned about high carbon emissions from tar sands oil production and objections by @entity148 officials to a route near a vital aquifer			0
republicans in @entity153 , accusing @entity3 of avoiding the issue until after the november election , tried to speed the process by tacking a measure requiring an immediate decision to the temporary payroll tax cut bill last december			1
the @entity3 administration then rejected the pipeline permit in january , saying an alternate route from @entity148 had yet to be decided			2
since then , republicans have persisted in attacking @entity3 for rejecting the permit			2
the president announced thursday in @entity13 that he was using his executive authority to order federal agencies to expedite the approval process for large - scale infrastructure projects like oil pipelines			2
more specifically , he ordered the portion of the @entity131 running from @entity13 to the @entity135 to be placed at the top of the list			0
" we 're making this new pipeline from @entity13 to the @entity135 a priority , " @entity3 said to cheers , later adding that " as long as i 'm president , we 're going to keep encouraging oil development and infrastructure and we 're going to do it in a way that protects the health and safety of the @entity46 people			1
we do n't have to choose between one or the other			0
" many private companies -- including @entity187 , the @entity133 company behind the @entity131 project -- are working to build pipelines that relieve the bottleneck of oil in @entity13 , a major hub for crude oil storage and trade			0
while federal agencies like the @entity197 and the @entity198 have some involvement in the approval process for the domestic portion of the pipeline , the federal government has relatively little control when compared to the absolute say it holds over the portion that crosses the international border with @entity133			0
the ultimate decision - making authority for the pipeline 's domestic route lies mainly with the states it crosses , prompting republicans to question whether the president can actually claim any credit for speeding the project along			2
house speaker @entity215 , @entity216 , told reporters thursday that @entity3 was claiming credit he did n't deserve on the southern leg of the @entity131 pipeline while continuing to prevent construction on the northern leg from @entity133			2
" it 's already gotten its approvals and this idea that the president is going to expedite this will have no impact on the construction of this pipeline , " @entity215 said of the @entity13 - @entity135 portion			0
" the president has continued to block development of oil and gas reserves , big reserves , on federal lands			2
and he can go out and make all the noise that he wants , but the facts are there			0
" poll : majority say build @entity131 on wednesday , @entity3 kicked off his energy tour with stops in @entity245 , @entity246 , and @entity247 , @entity248 , to focus on work on alternative energy sources			1
the visit to @entity245 was designed to tout the success of solar technology at the largest photovoltaic solar facility in the nation			0
photovoltaic solar panels create energy directly from sunlight without the need for any water or moving parts			2
@entity3 acknowledged the high prices at the pump , but used the problem as a reason to abandon federal " subsidies " to oil and gas companies			1
" we want to encourage production of oil and gas , and make sure that wherever we 've got @entity46 resources , we are tapping into them , " the president said			2
" but they do n't need an additional incentive when gas is $ 3.75 a gallon , when oil is $ 120 a barrel , $ 125 a barrel			0
they do n't need additional incentives			0
" what the president calls subsidies , the petroleum industry calls the same tax breaks afforded those in many other industries			0
the push to end what @entity3 deems to be preferential treatment to a petroleum industry that 's never been more profitable was central to his two - day tour , but the president also used the trip to push back against those who call federal aid to the renewable energy industry a waste of money			1
" some of these folks want to dismiss the promise of solar power and wind power and fuel - efficient cars , " @entity3 said in @entity245			1
" in fact , they make jokes about it			0
one member of @entity153 who shall remain unnamed called these jobs ' phony ' -- called them phony jobs			0
i mean , think about that mindset , that attitude that says because something is new , it must not be real			0
if these guys were around when @entity1 set sail , they 'd be charter members of the @entity325			0
" with nearly a million solar panels spread across 450 acres , @entity327 1 in @entity245 provides power for roughly 17,000 homes , but employs just 10 full - time employees			0
the solar plant 's owner , @entity331 , is in the process of building a second facility nearby that 's set to more than triple the output of @entity327 1			0
construction of the second facility -- @entity339 2 -- has created 175 temporary jobs but , according to @entity331 's own projections , the final solar plant will result in just five full - time positions			0
@entity2 's @entity343 contributed to this report .			0

new : president @entity3 touts reduced dependency on foreign oil
" we are drilling more , " @entity3 says in *response* to critics
the president is speaking at sites for solar , domestic oil and other energy sources
@entity44 presidential *candidates* say his actions on energy fall short
