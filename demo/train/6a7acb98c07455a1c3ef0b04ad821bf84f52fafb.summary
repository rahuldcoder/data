@entity0 , @entity1 -- it seemed like an exciting assignment -- go to @entity1 on the trail of former @entity8 contractor @entity6			1
after acknowledging that he leaked details to reporters about a massive @entity12 government surveillance program , @entity6 reportedly arrived at @entity1 's @entity13 on a flight from @entity15 on june 23 , and settled in at the transit lounge			1
but he has remained out of sight			0
could i find him ? would he be browsing the duty - free shops , amazed at the sheer volume of magnum bottles of liquor for sale ? would he be sipping cappuccinos in the coffee shop , miffed that they cost 5 euros , or $ 6.50 , each ? is @entity6 ready to take flight ? determined and anxious , i flew in under the cover of darkness on an overnight @entity32 flight from @entity33 , arriving at 6 a.m. the passport control officer told me to wait			1
" sit over there , " she said , and walked off with my documents			0
would i end up in legal limbo like @entity6 , whose @entity12 passport was revoked by @entity40 , making it difficult for him to cross borders ? out of @entity43 : @entity6 's possible flight paths well , no. after about 10 minutes i was waved through , and got out of there so quickly that i forgot to ask the passport officer if she 'd seen @entity6 lately			1
but there was no entry stamp to @entity43 in my passport			0
because , like @entity6 , i had not officially entered the country ; instead , i was now in the lounge for passengers who are just transiting through , along with those who enter the area to board departing flights			1
it 's a truly international place , filled with a broad swath of humanity			2
citizens from the @entity43 , @entity60 , @entity61 , a small number of @entity12 and some @entity63			0
young backpackers and rich business executives			0
exhausted parents with children , including a brave little boy whose legs appeared disabled , struggling to take every step , squeezing his mother 's hand			2
all trolling the transit zone , with its gaudy emporium of high - end shops wedged next to mom - and - pop trinket stores that sell souvenirs seemingly left over from the old @entity78 , including a fold - up metal drinking cup , which i could n't resist			1
inside @entity82 's ' @entity81 ' there are coffee shops that offer @entity43 pancakes and @entity86 , and charge in rubles , dollars or euros			2
there 's even a @entity90 and a @entity91			2
in this enormous transit lounge , @entity6 surely has plenty of places to hide			1
its three terminals -- @entity97 , @entity98 -- form a very long , curvy rectangle , with 60 boarding gates , and flights to a lot of places that @entity6 ca n't go , for fear of being caught			1
@entity105 ? not a good idea for him to fly to @entity108 or @entity109			0
@entity110 is obviously out of the question			0
@entity112 or @entity113 ? nyet			0
even @entity116 , capital of @entity117 , is probably risky			0
there is an @entity32 flight to @entity120 , with connections to @entity122 , a country whose leftist government has offered asylum to @entity6			1
@entity13 stakeout : @entity126 on a friday , my first day in the transit zone , there was no @entity120 flight to keep an eye on , which gave me a chance to explore			1
@entity43 and other countries can designate various locations and settings , even outside of the airport , as the amorphous transit zone			1
there could be detention areas , medical facilities , or other locations in @entity1 given that designation -- so @entity6 could be miles away from the airport but still in " transit			1
" one part of the @entity145 , not connected to the terminal but visible from it , is part of the transit zone			1
i decided to see whether @entity6 was holed up there			1
i reserved two rooms -- one for me , the other for a @entity2 camerawoman who came from @entity109			1
@entity32 ground agents directed us to a bus , which rolled across the tarmac as , officially , a moving part of the transit lounge			2
so we were leaving the airport in @entity43 -- but staying in the " zone			1
" accompanied at all times by minders , we checked in and were directed to the second floor , the secure transit zone floor			1
the guard in the hall made sure we did n't go down to the lobby or gym or to other floors			0
the only way to get food was from room service , which is actually not such a bad idea			0
@entity6 could have been behind any of the 40 room doors on the second floor			1
he did not come out			0
at 4 a.m. the next day , we left the hotel , accompanied at all times , until we were back in the airport terminal transit lounge for our departing flights			1
the rules say you can stay a maximum of 24 hours in the transit lounge and then must leave on a flight			1
but @entity6 has apparently been in the lounge for nearly three weeks			1
how does he do it ? i would need a second trip to find out more			0
interactive : movements and asylum requests a few days later , i was back , this time alone			2
on the second trip , you begin to feel like something of an authority on the transit lounge			2
@entity6 reportedly is traveling with several laptop computers			1
if they 're heavy , he 's got a problem			2
so did i. there are hardly any luggage carts in the transit lounge			2
i finally found one , and then a woman from @entity206 followed me around until i was done with it			0
i searched again , up and down , and when it got to be 12:30 a.m. -- when there are no flights for several hours -- i checked into the @entity211 in @entity212 , renting a tiny room for the minimum four hours			2
did n't see @entity6 there either , nor back in the terminal , starting at 5 a.m.			1
i figured the best shot was the @entity120 flight , leaving at 2:05 p.m. it 's no secret that observers are closely watching that flight			2
i went quite early to the boarding gate , number 22 in @entity222 a couple of guys with beards looked vaguely like @entity6			1
but no , one turned out to be @entity227 , the other @entity43			0
the @entity227 man said i was the second person to ask him that			0
a veteran @entity43 photographer and i were working the scene			0
there was a lot to monitor -- the passengers getting on at the gate , the stairway from the tarmac up to the boarding walkway , for crew and possibly someone else , and a terminal elevator , inside the secure zone , from which someone might be hustled aboard down the walkway			2
watching all this -- and , it also turns out , watching us -- was a mysterious , middle - aged burly man			0
as the boarding was in progress , he made a mobile phone call , reporting back to someone -- in @entity254 -- that two photographers were taking pictures			0
after the boarding finished , and the plane was about to push back with no sign of @entity6 , i approached the burly man			1
i asked him , in clear @entity254 , if @entity6 was aboard			1
he pretended not to understand			0
i repeated the question in @entity254			0
he again feigned inability to speak @entity254			0
so i asked him in @entity263			0
he replied that he did n't know			0
could he have been from @entity122 or @entity63 ? he did n't say			0
at least i could see and talk to the burly man			0
so far , i have n't been able to do that with @entity6 .			2

@entity2 's @entity266 spent time in the transit zone of @entity1 's airport
@entity6 is *believed* to be in the transit zone
the zone can include other locations in @entity1
the maximum stay allowed is 24 hours
