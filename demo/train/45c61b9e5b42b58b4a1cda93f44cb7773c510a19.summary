-- former law clerks to judge @entity2 sent a letter of support to the @entity6 leadership monday , offering their " enthusiastic and wholehearted support " for the @entity10 @entity9 nominee			1
judge @entity2 the letter -- addressed to senate majority leader @entity12 , @entity13 ; minority leader @entity14 , @entity15 ; @entity17 chairman @entity16 , @entity18 ; and @entity20 sen. @entity19 , the ranking @entity21 on the @entity17 -- was signed by 45 of her 49 former law clerks			1
the @entity24 said it was unable to find two of the clerks , and the two others had conflicts of interest that precluded their signing the letter			2
" our group includes federal prosecutors and other government lawyers ; private law firm partners and in - house corporate counsel ; and legal academics and public interest lawyers , " the letter said			2
" although our professional experiences are diverse , we are united in our strong belief that @entity2 is a brilliant and first - rate judge who is an ideal selection for our nation 's highest court			1
" in an interview monday on @entity0 , former law clerks @entity48 and @entity49 sang their former boss 's praises			1
" the judge is a fantastic person to work for , " said @entity48 , a @entity52 graduate who clerked in 1997 - 1998 and is now a @entity10 attorney for the @entity54			0
" professionally and personally , she is a brilliant woman , she 's a mentor , she 's a fantastic personality			0
" " she 's , more than anything , incredibly hard - working , incredibly conscientious , " concurred @entity49 , a @entity57 graduate who clerked for @entity2 in 1996 - 1997 and 1998 - 1999 and asked her to officiate at his wedding			2
" beyond being a mentor to all of her clerks professionally , personally she has been a big part of our lives			0
" @entity2 , a @entity65 and @entity66 graduate , spent six years as a district judge and a decade on the 2nd @entity10 @entity68			2
the letter came a day after leading @entity6 @entity70 indicated that a filibuster of @entity2 is unlikely , though they promised to not shy away from what they characterized as her troubling judicial record			1
meanwhile , one of the @entity6 's top @entity79 , @entity76 of @entity77 , told @entity80 on sunday , " i think she 's virtually filibuster - proof when people learn her record and her story			1
" but the @entity21 leadership on sunday 's political talk shows did not back away from criticizing @entity2			1
@entity88 , the @entity6 minority leader , highlighted her controversial remark at a 2005 panel discussion at @entity91 , where she told students that the @entity93 is where " policy is made [ and ] where ... the law is percolating			2
" " those of us who are elected are supposed to make policy , but those of us who are appointed are supposed to apply the law , " @entity88 said			0
in addition , @entity70 criticized @entity2 's 2001 speech at the @entity103 , where she said she " would hope that a wise @entity105 woman , with the richness of her experiences , would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life			1
" " it does trouble me to say that one type of old person versus another one is going to make a different or better decision , " sen. @entity111 , @entity112 , told @entity0 's @entity113 on " @entity114 " on sunday			0
the @entity24 and other @entity79 defenders of @entity2 have said that her remarks have been taken out of context			0
@entity48 said criticism of @entity2 's remark was misguided			1
" what it says to me is that a lot of people still do n't know her record , " she said			0
" i view it as a comment that is taken out of context and that , read in context , really just says what many people acknowledge is totally noncontroversial , which is that that life experience is a benefit to the process of judging cases and decision - making , and that you do n't leave your life experience at the door , that diversity on the court is a good thing			0
" she added that , in her experience , @entity2 " sticks very closely to the rule of law			2
that 's the kind of judge she is			0
" in his weekly radio address saturday , president @entity153 warned republicans not to play politics with @entity2 's nomination			1
" there are ... some in @entity160 who are attempting to draw old battle lines and playing the usual political games , pulling a few comments out of context to paint a distorted picture of @entity2 's record , " @entity153 said			1
" no nominee should be seated without rigorous evaluation and hearing ; i expect nothing less			0
but what i hope is that we can avoid the political posturing and ideological brinksmanship that has bogged down this process , and @entity177 , in the past			0
" @entity0 's @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
