-- @entity1 , already grappling with union issues and bankruptcy fallout , is now confronting a third problem : growing reports of loose seats			1
on tuesday , the company said another flight had experienced loose seats , bringing the total to three flights on two planes in a week			1
a plane headed from @entity16 , @entity17 , to @entity18 on september 26 had seats come loose , the airline 's vice president of safety confirmed tuesday			1
the same aircraft experienced a similar problem on a @entity22 to @entity24 flight on monday morning			0
that flight had to return to @entity26			0
separately , a @entity27 757 from @entity28 to @entity24 carrying 175 passengers diverted to @entity22 on saturday when three seats in row 12 came loose shortly after takeoff			2
the airline said it would inspect 47 @entity27 757 planes after the incidents			0
after incidents with airline seats , readers let loose " originally , @entity40 planned to evaluate the seats on eight @entity27 757 airplanes , but out of an abundance of caution , the decision was made to proactively evaluate a total of 47 @entity27 757 airplanes that have the same model @entity49 seats with a common locking mechanism , " company spokeswoman @entity38 said in a statement			1
" @entity1 's internal investigation has focused on one of three types of @entity49 seats on the 757s and how the rows of these three seats fit into the track that is used to secure the rows to the floor of the airplanes			1
our maintenance and engineering teams have discovered that the root cause is a saddle clamp improperly installed on the foot of the row leg , " she said			0
the clamps were used on 47 of the company 's 102 @entity27 757 airplanes			0
so far , @entity1 has inspected at least 36 planes and found that six -- including the two involved in the recent diversions -- had seats that were not properly secured			1
not all of the seats were loose , the company said , but they had the potential to become loose			1
eleven aircraft could be inspected wednesday			0
@entity38 said the seats issue does not appear to be connected to any one work group or maintenance facility , and apologized for any inconvenience to customers			0
" safety is -- and always will be -- @entity1 's top concern , " the spokeswoman said			2
the @entity90 is looking into the incidents of loose seats , which are the latest in a string of woes for @entity1			1
earlier tuesday , an @entity1 flight from @entity97 to @entity98 made an unscheduled landing at @entity100 in @entity101 after a passenger reported a smoky odor , an airline spokesman said			2
@entity105 98 , a @entity106 carrying 246 passengers and 14 crew members , was diverted as a precaution , airline spokesman @entity104 said			0
an inspection revealed that the odor was coming from an overhead fan that had overheated , he said			0
@entity113 , head of operations for @entity100 , said such technical diversions are not uncommon			0
who wants to fly @entity1 ? the airline has also been beset recently by labor troubles , delays and flight cancellations			2
@entity1 , which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year , persuaded a judge to throw out its contract with the pilots union last month			1
since then , the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket			2
more than 1,000 @entity1 flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed in the past month alone			1
airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it claims are frivolous reports about aircraft problems			0
the pilots union has denied management 's assertion			1
late tuesday , a spokesman for the @entity142 said it would resume contract negotiations with the airline			1
@entity146 said talks could start as early as wednesday			2
a company spokesman similarly said that negotiations are set to resume this week			1
meanwhile , @entity150 , deputy director of the @entity151 of the @entity152 , dismissed the notion that the problems with loose seats were linked to labor issues as " without any basis in fact			2
" seat installation work is largely carried out by outside contractors , rather than maintenance personnel employed by the airline , he said in a statement			0
" problems related to seats are less likely a labor problem , but rather a management issue related to outsourcing work to third - party facilities , " he said			0
@entity1 plans to increase its use of outside maintenance facilities , including in @entity172 and other overseas locations , as it seeks to exit bankruptcy , he added			0
seats come loose on two @entity1 flights @entity0 's @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 contributed to this report .			1

the seats came loose during three flights on two planes
@entity1 is evaluating dozens of planes " out of abundance of caution "
the company says it has found six planes with seats that were not properly secured
a pilots union an @entity1 could resume contract negotiations as early as wednesday
