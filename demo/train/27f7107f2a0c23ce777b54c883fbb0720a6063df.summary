-- last week , we laid out some ground rules for using the @entity3 to see what the @entity5 's saying about your co-workers , your love interest and yourself			1
and as soon as the column went live , the reader feedback started pouring in			2
hey , @entity12 is a quotidian skill these days : the " @entity27 " writers made a joke of it almost eight years ago when @entity16 looked up her @entity18 boyfriend " on @entity3 - dot - com , " and there 's even a snotty website you can send when a knuckle - dragger asks you a question instead of looking it up himself : @entity28			1
so it 's kinda surprising that it 's still at the center of an amorphous cloud of confusion and questions			1
but , dear readers , you brought up some nuanced points we could n't elucidate in last week 's column			1
allow us to attempt to clear up some of that fog			2
the lesson : once you 've dug up some dirt , you ca n't cover it up again			2
" when i started my current job , it was just months after someone i knew was convicted of sexually molesting a child			2
... it left me with a really unforgiving attitude about those convicted of sex crimes against children			2
in the course of my work , i was demonstrating something to my co-worker and randomly selected a co-worker to @entity3			1
@entity59 and behold , the man had similar charges ( and a guilty verdict ) a dozen years ago , just before coming to work here			2
i immediately swore the other co-worker to secrecy , having no idea this was even a possibility when entering the name			2
unfortunately , the man i searched is my immediate supervisor , and it makes me kind of sick to have to deal with him daily			2
the job is great , the pay is good , but i just wish he 'd hurry up and retire			0
i ca n't ask to be transferred , as even asking would spread this information further			0
unfortunately , some things you ca n't just " un-know " when knowing is inconvenient			1
we 're sorry for all the bad happenings , but you bring up an important point : you ca n't return to blissful ignorance after you 've searched for someone			1
in this case , if you 're sure you do n't want to talk to a higher - up about transferring ( if it was that easy to find in @entity3 , they likely already know ) , it 's probably best to focus on remaining professional around this man			1
we humans are funny creatures : we 're unhappier waiting for test results than hearing a definitive cancer diagnosis			0
your search for your co-worker was random and innocent , but sometimes we do tumble , " @entity95 " - style , into @entity3 rabbit holes that we do n't need to conduct			1
like a dog rubbing its injured paw into the ground , we get buzzed on pain as we search for ex-significant others , say , or find out more and more about a tragic 12 - car pileup a few miles away			1
so -- cue that guitar - strumming learning - moment music in the excellent ' 90s television show @entity108 -- if netiquette is all about being nice to people while you 're using the @entity105 , that should include being nice to yourself			1
know when to pause , @entity109 out , and busy yourself with those @entity111 friends			0
remember them ? nice folks			0
the lesson : @entity12 shines a spotlight on what others think about the search term			1
" the only issue anyone would have with this article would be the failure to note that anything written on the internet , @entity123 , is the product of some person 's @entity125 into a computer of that data			0
the @entity130 by the person who is the subject of the search , and there may very well be no meaningful way to eliminate , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , rumor , speculation , and hearsay			1
shouting to two @entity144 in manners			0
but really , you are too kind , thinking this is the absolute only issue anyone would have with our article			0
anyway , you raise a valid ( if obvious ) point : much of the stuff that pops up when you @entity3 someone was n't put there by said someone			1
but , as we 've written about on this very canvas , you can proactively deal with online haters and take charge of your online reputation			0
that 's why you need to be googling yourself regularly -- so you know what your new boss , new friends and new beau will see when they type in your name			1
and then when you find out you have a name in common with a cross-country track star / @entity172 doll / fugitive on " @entity175 , " you can write a charming blog post distinguishing yourself from your name - twin			1
the lesson : admitting to your date that you 've googled him is tricky business			1
" i was on a second or third date with a guy who was quite a bit older than me			0
i asked him his age but he would n't tell me			0
later i looked him up on a public records site and found it			0
the next date i told him i had found his age online in what i thought was a playful manner			0
the relationship did n't last because as it turned out he had a girlfriend in another country for years with whom he has been discussing a serious future , and months later during an argument he told me that my googling him had really turned him off and included it in a " want to know how to win a guy ? " e-mail			1
so , was i a creep for searching for his age online , or just telling him about it , or both ? his age had no bearing on my feelings for him			0
... i was just curious to know it			0
" first off , we can answer this question very cleanly : this guy was the creep , and was grasping at straws to find a way to make you feel bad			1
he would n't tell you his age , had a secret relationship and wrote you a nasty e-mail telling you how to win a guy ? major loser , and you have nothing to worry about in the creepiness department			0
( unless you made him a scrapbook from everything you uncovered in your public records search			2
in that case , yeahhh ... ) but this does bring up a larger point : discussing internet searches during the dance of courtship is kind of a @entity237 sport -- in an eerily parallel situation , we 've had a first date ( met on a dating site ) refuse to share his age when it came up in conversation , blithely bleating , " i mean it 's on my profile , i do n't see why i need to say it again			0
" ( he was 32 , too old for such nonsense			0
) that 's too little info			0
we had another first date reveal that he 'd clicked through something like 11 pages of @entity3 results ( " so , i see you were runner - up in the state spelling bee as an eighth - grader " )			1
the just right approach is somewhere between keeping your mouth totally shut ( let him reveal his penchant for photographing pensive - looking pigeons on his own schedule ) or , after a few dates , bringing up something that 's on the first page of results ( " not to be creepy but i creepily googled you the other night -- i had no idea you wrote that book on pigeons as pets ! i 'm a birder myself			2
" ) hey , everyone loves flattery			0
just make sure you 're not getting dirt on an unrelated author with the same name			0
because a love of pigeons could be a real turn - off .			2
