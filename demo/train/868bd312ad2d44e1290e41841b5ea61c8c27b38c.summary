-- since the dawn of the @entity5 age in 2007 , loyal @entity2 users have watched their favorite device maker stumble into an ever - steepening decline			1
some of the collapse is due to the consumer changeover to @entity12 and @entity13 @entity11 products , but the company -- once known as @entity15 -- has n't helped itself with poor planning and delayed product introductions			2
on monday , the company that once blazed the trail in the smartphone market announced it 's being taken private by its largest shareholder , @entity21 , a @entity23 insurance company			1
the move comes on the heels of an announced $ 1 billion quarterly loss and layoffs of 4,500 employees			2
its future as a maker of smartphones may be in doubt			2
now the dwindling numbers of loyal @entity2 users must decide : is this the last straw ? it 's no idle question			1
for all the attention paid to @entity2 's fall and the rise of @entity5 and @entity11 , there 's still a sizable blackberry market out there			1
@entity43 estimates that there are in excess of 50 million @entity2 users , and they remain fiercely devoted to their phones , with their secure e-mail software and physical keyboards			1
" you can tear my @entity56 's real keyboard out of my cold dead fingers , " user @entity51 of @entity52 wrote on @entity53			2
@entity2 : why breaking up is hard to do @entity58 , an it security professional who runs the site @entity62 , still prefers his @entity2 because it " focuses on communications first " -- even though he 's familiar with both @entity11 and @entity5 platforms			1
" they 're very good devices to consume information , but the main point of the phone is that it 's more like a computer , " he says of the @entity12 and @entity13 phones			2
@entity71 , he says , are better at " flow " from e-mail to calendar to other applications			0
he hopes that the company returns to its roots			0
" i think that @entity21 should double down on @entity2 and the combination of corporate and consumer market that appreciated the rock solid communication platform it offered , " he wrote on @entity62			1
" this means an end to the ' me too ' additions of features to @entity2 and instead appealing to the market that made @entity2 take off			1
" one commenter observed , however , that the company will be hard pressed to win new converts			0
" not good news for consumers , people hate the bb name and what it stands for			0
self - inflicted suicide , " kingbernie wrote			0
he suspected that becoming a corporate - focused software business might be the company 's best way out of the wilderness -- even if it means leaving the consumer market behind			2
from @entity56 to ' depressing ' : the @entity2 's 5 - year fall @entity102 , a tech analyst and regular contributor to the @entity2 boards on @entity105 , says @entity2 fans should remain wary			1
" going private does n't necessarily change the outcome for the company			1
all it is guaranteed to change is the ownership structure , " he said via e-mail			2
" it 's not a nail in the coffin , nor is it some massive opportunity to fix themselves			0
no matter who owns the shares they still have to compete with solid competitors			0
going private just lets them operate outside of so much public scrutiny			2
" for those who want to put their blackberrys in a drawer next to their @entity132 but want to keep a physical keyboard on their devices , your options are limited			0
the @entity137 and the @entity138 are @entity11 - compatible and have relatively large slide - out keyboards , but reviewers have taken issue with their camera capabilities			0
in addition , @entity62 's @entity58 observes , those keyboards -- which are landscape - oriented instead of the portrait - style versions on @entity130 -- seem like " afterthoughts			0
" " even if you 're in an e-mail and you want to hit the ' delete ' button to delete an e-mail -- you think that 's logical -- it does n't work , " he says			2
what killed @entity2 : terrible apps the @entity156 , another @entity11 phone with a physical keyboard , is marketed for its " rugged innovation " but , says @entity58 , he does n't think it 's really aimed at the general consumer			1
that leads to the host of smartphones with virtual keyboards , including the new @entity166 and @entity167 , the @entity11 - compatible @entity168 and the @entity11 @entity169 , among many others			0
all have their pros and cons , whether it 's your comfort with their operating systems or your desire for certain accessories			0
but for those , like @entity102 , who want to stick with @entity2 , it will hard to get them to change			1
his household includes a number of @entity12 items -- including his wife 's @entity5 -- but he prefers the @entity2			1
he 's frustrated by the lack of apps for the device but still prefers the overall experience			0
" @entity2 has always been ( and still is ) the best experience for communicating			1
at first it was push email and physical keyboards			0
now i 'm on a @entity196 and i find the multitasking + software keyboard + email experience is second to none , " he wrote			0
" an @entity5 would feel like a step backwards on those things which matter to me			0
" besides , says @entity58 , he likes how the @entity2 creates community			1
" the one thing you notice immediately when people change from @entity2 to other devices is you never hear from them anymore , " he says			1
opinion : why i 'll never ditch my blackberry			0

on monday , @entity2 announced that it was being taken private
despite decline in consumer sales , there are still 50 million @entity2 users
they 're very loyal to the brand and hope change is harbinger of an *upswing*
