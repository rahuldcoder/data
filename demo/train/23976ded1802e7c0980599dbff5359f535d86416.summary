-- @entity2 president @entity1 has dismissed claims that his team 's cars carry subliminal tobacco advertising as " ridiculous			1
" reports last week quoted several health professionals as suggesting the red , white and black barcode on @entity2 's @entity11 cars and @entity12 and @entity14 's overalls were a link to @entity17 cigarettes			1
tobacco advertising in @entity11 was outlawed in 2005 , yet reports claimed a spokesman for the @entity21 said the barcode constituted potential subliminal marketing			0
the @entity24 newspaper quoted @entity25 , a @entity26 , as saying the barcode resembled the lower half of a packet of @entity17 cigarettes , and that it was " creeping branding "			2
under a law passed in both @entity32 and @entity33 in 2002 , it is an offence for a tobacco company to sponsor a sporting event			0
@entity36 , the owner of @entity17 cigarettes , is a long - standing sponsor of @entity2 , but @entity1 has described the stories as " pointless			1
" he told @entity2 's official web site : " frankly , i find this argument completely pointless and it is verging on the ridiculous to claim that the color red or a graphic design which shows a bar code could induce people to smoke			2
" at a time when , on the other side of the @entity49 they are fighting to provide a more equal health service , in the old continent of @entity52 , so called experts are racking their brains to come up with theories that have no scientific basis : i think there are more important matters to think about than a bar code			0
" therefore , it 's best not to waste any more time replying to this sort of nonsense or to those who are instrumental in wanting to stoke up the story			0
