-- before this week , most @entity1 had likely never heard of @entity2 and even fewer could place it on a map			1
but the central @entity6 nation , which is about the size of @entity8 , is important to @entity1 foreign policy for one simple reason : a vital military base through which tens of thousands of troops pass every month on their way in and out of @entity15			1
the fate of the @entity17 was thrown into question wednesday when @entity2 president @entity19 was forced to flee the capital after angry mobs seized government headquarters			1
fighting between police and protesters left 75 people dead and hundreds injured , authorities said thursday			0
the protesters say they are in control of the government , but @entity19 sent word thursday from southern @entity2 that he is not abandoning his duties			1
the @entity1 likely will retain use of the @entity35 facility even if @entity19 's opponents secure control of the government , said @entity37 , a central @entity38 expert at @entity39			1
latest news out of @entity2 " it 's going to survive , but it 's going to generate a lot of noise , uncomfortable negotiations and a lot of hard bargaining , " said @entity41 , author of " @entity42			1
" the @entity35 base plays a major role in internal @entity2 policy on several levels			1
for starters , it is a major source of income in the small nation , which has a gross domestic product of less than $ 12 billion a year , according to the @entity58			2
the nation ranks 143rd in the world in terms of its gdp			2
in exchange for use of the base , the @entity1 provides about $ 180 million in aid to @entity2 each year , @entity41 said			1
although the @entity1 does not pay rent for use of any bases in the world , @entity41 said , about $ 60 million of the @entity2 aid is considered payment for access to the @entity35 facility			1
in addition , @entity41 said , @entity19 's political opponents say the @entity1 pays about $ 160 million a year to buy fuel for @entity1 aircraft using the base			1
" the base is as much an economic investment as much as it is a security investment , " @entity41 told @entity0			1
" @entity2 does not have a lot of economic assets			1
that 's why the base is important			1
" but the base also has deep significance to @entity19 's opponents , who see it as a symbol of the deposed president 's corruption and @entity1 complicity in his abuse of power			1
" the @entity1 stayed silent as @entity19 built a criminal state , " @entity41 said			2
@entity91 : are you there ? share photos , video political opponents believe that aid paid for use of the base went into @entity19 's pockets , not the country 's coffers			2
" that money went to companies and shady off - shore enterprises controlled by the family , " said @entity41			0
" it 's the actual site of tacit deals and corruption			0
" the new government has said it will address citizens ' concerns			0
@entity2 has had a troubled history since shortly after gaining independence when the @entity115 collapsed in 1991			1
also gaining independence that year were the three other " stans , " as some people commonly refer to the region : @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
" @entity2 seemed to be in the 1990s the one bright spot , " @entity41 said			2
@entity124 , who had been president since 1990 , started off as a good leader , @entity41 said , " and politics were pretty pluralistic			0
then , he started regressing			0
" @entity124 increasingly turned to repression			0
" as they do , he stayed a few years too many , " said @entity41			0
" @entity19 was bad , but @entity124 was a real thug			0
" as happened this week , opponents took to the streets in 2005 and drove @entity124 from power			0
@entity19 won election as president in july 2005			0
but he , too , soon started to maneuver to increase his power and consolidate control			0
demonstrations by political opponents in april , may and november 2006 led to the adoption of a new constitution that gave some of the president 's powers to parliament and the government			0
a year later , the parliament voted to restore some of those powers to the presidency			0
in september 2007 , the new constitution was declared illegal , and @entity19 resumed having the presidential powers he had inherited when taking office			0
" the president then dissolved parliament , called for early elections and gained control of the new parliament through his newly created political party , @entity155 , in december 2007 elections , " the @entity58 says			0
" in july 2009 , after months of harassment against his opponents and media critics , @entity19 won re-election in a presidential campaign that the international community deemed flawed			0
" just a few months later in october , @entity19 engineered changes in the government structure that further consolidated his already considerable hold on power			0
" the @entity58 says concerns about @entity19 's rule , " included privatization of state - owned enterprises , negative trends in democracy and political freedoms , endemic corruption , improving interethnic relations , electricity generation and combating terrorism			1
" that such turmoil should fall upon such a country seems incongruous to some			0
" @entity2 are great , " @entity41 said			1
" they are very hospitable			0
" the @entity58 describes @entity2 as a land of " incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions			2
" with an estimated 2009 population of about 5.4 million , @entity2 ranks no. 111 among nations			2
it is a landlocked country and entirely mountainous , with 94 percent of the nation 3,280 feet ( 1,000 meters ) above sea level and an average elevation of 9,000 feet ( 2,750 meters ) , the @entity58 says			2
the topography includes many tall peaks , glaciers and high - altitude lakes			0
nearly two - thirds of the nation 's citizens belong to the @entity2 ethnic group , while nearly 14 percent are @entity122 and more than 12 percent are @entity199 , the @entity58 says			1
likewise , nearly 65 percent of the people speak @entity2 , which is the official language			2
nearly 14 percent speak @entity122 and @entity199 is the language for more than 12 percent			0
three of every four citizens are @entity205 and one in five are @entity207			0
although @entity2 shares a 533 - mile ( 858 - kilometer ) border with @entity210 , most people identify with mother - nation @entity211			1
@entity2 was formally annexed to @entity211 in 1876 and became a @entity115 republic in 1936			1
" there 's a strong cultural affinity to @entity211 due to media , education and the @entity115 legacy , " @entity41 said			1
still , @entity210 is knocking at the door			2
" @entity210 has moved in , but it 's been a very recent development , " said @entity41			1
" last year , @entity210 did a lot more trade there than @entity211 did			2
but there 's very little cultural affiliation with @entity210			1
" there is no seeming affinity for the @entity1 , a distant nation tied in the minds and hearts of many @entity2 to corruption at home			1
the question that remained unanswered this week was whether millions of dollars in @entity1 aid would provide enough affiliation to allow continued use of the @entity17 .			2

@entity6 nation is home to a military base that 's vital to @entity1 in @entity15 *war*
@entity2 initially showed great promise after the break - up of the @entity115
its rulers eventually fell into repressive rule ; some residents say @entity1 turned blind eye
@entity210 is beginning to make economic *inroads* with the landlocked nation
