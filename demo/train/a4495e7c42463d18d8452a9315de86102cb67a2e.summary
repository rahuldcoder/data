two @entity1 missionaries infected with the deadly ebola virus were given an experimental drug			1
shortly after , dr. @entity4 and @entity5 were flown separately from @entity6 to @entity8 's @entity7 -- the first human patients with @entity10 to ever come to the @entity1			1
@entity5 was released from the hospital tuesday			1
on thursday morning , @entity4 walked out of that same hospital with no signs of the virus in his system , doctors say			1
their recoveries seem to offer hope for those fighting the largest @entity10 outbreak in known history			1
more than 2,400 people have been infected by the virus , according to the @entity23 , and it 's killed more than half			1
but @entity26 is not an approved treatment for @entity10 ; in fact , no approved , proven treatment exists			1
so governments , aid organizations and scientists around the globe are racing to find a way to stop the virus			0
here are answers to questions about @entity10 patients and treatments for the disease			1
are @entity4 and @entity5 cured ? mostly			1
for @entity10 patients to leave isolation , two blood tests had to come back negative for the ebola virus			1
so their bodily fluids , like blood , sweat and feces , are no longer infectious			0
" @entity5 is free of the virus , but the lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition , " @entity5 's husband , @entity48 , said in a statement			1
some doctors believe the virus can remain in vaginal fluid and semen for up to several months , according to @entity23			0
dr. @entity58 , an infectious disease specialist at @entity7 , said there is no evidence @entity10 has ever been transmitted this way , but the risk was discussed with both patients			1
are they now immune to @entity10 ? doctors believe surviving @entity10 leaves you immune to future infection			2
scientists have found that people who survive @entity10 have antibodies in their blood that would provide protection against that strain of the virus in the future , and possibly against other strains as well			1
but , as you can imagine , they have n't tested this theory by infecting survivors with the virus again			0
there are four @entity10 strains known to infect humans ; the @entity84 causing the current outbreak is the most common			2
who else has been given @entity26 ? the @entity10 drug was flown to @entity88 to give to a priest named @entity90 , who had contracted the virus in @entity6			1
@entity90 died on august 12			0
it 's unclear if he was given the drug before he died			0
@entity26 appears to be helping three @entity6 health care workers who were given the experimental drug			1
they have shown " very positive signs of recovery , " the @entity6 @entity97 said earlier this week			0
medical professionals treating the workers have called their progress " remarkable			0
who makes the drug ? the drug was developed by the biotech firm @entity106 , which is based in @entity107			0
the company was founded in 2003 " to develop novel pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases , focusing on unmet needs in global health and biodefense , " according to its website			0
@entity106 has been working with the @entity117 and the @entity118 , an arm of the military responsible for countering weapons of mass destruction , to develop an @entity10 treatment for several years			2
how does @entity26 work ? antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to mark and destroy foreign , or harmful , cells			2
a monoclonal antibody is similar , except it 's engineered in a lab so it will attach to specific parts of a dangerous cell , according to the @entity132 , mimicking your immune system 's natural response			0
monoclonal antibodies are used to treat many different types of conditions			0
sources told @entity140 the medicine given to @entity4 and @entity5 abroad was a three - mouse monoclonal antibody , meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the ebola virus , and then the antibodies generated within the mice 's blood were harvested to create the medicine			1
however , the drug can also be produced with proteins made from tobacco plants			0
@entity26 manufacturer @entity153 in @entity154 provided limited quantities of this kind of the drug to @entity7 , according to company spokesman @entity158			1
did doctors know it would work in humans ? no. the drug had shown promise in primates , but even in those experiments , just eight monkeys received the treatment			0
in any case , the human immune system can react differently than primates ' , which is why drugs are required to undergo human clinical trials before being approved by government agencies for widespread use			0
these cases will be studied further to determine how the drug worked with their immune systems			0
are there other @entity10 treatments out there ? several experimental drugs are in development , but none has been effective in humans			1
the market for these drugs is small -- @entity10 is a rare disease , almost completely confined to poor countries -- so funding for drug development has come largely from government agencies			1
in march , the @entity117 awarded a five - year , $ 28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight @entity10			2
on wednesday , @entity197 and the @entity199 's @entity198 announced money for @entity10 research will be made available from a $ 10.8 million initiative			2
will @entity26 or these other drugs be given to more @entity10 patients ? an ethics panel convened by the @entity23 concluded it is ethical to give experimental drugs during an outbreak as large as this one , but that does n't mean it will happen			1
@entity211 out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult , @entity210 says			0
experimental drugs typically are not mass - produced , and tracking the success of such a drug , if used , would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce			2
in an opinion article published in the journal nature this week , epidemiologist @entity219 says up to 30,000 people in @entity223 would have so far required treatment in this outbreak if it was available			0
what about an @entity10 vaccine ? for the record , " vaccine " and " treatment " are not interchangeable terms			2
a vaccine is given to prevent infection , whereas treatment generally refers to a drug given to a patient who has developed symptoms			0
there are several @entity10 vaccines in development			2
the @entity242 government has donated between 800 and 1,000 doses of an experimental @entity10 vaccine to @entity23			1
the drug , called @entity246 , is @entity242 - made and owned , having been developed by the @entity247			0
it 's never been tested on humans " but has shown promise in animal research , " the agency says			0
we do n't know if the vaccine has been given to anyone on the ground			0
the @entity117 says a safety trial of an @entity10 vaccine will start as early as september .			2

@entity1 patients infected with @entity10 are being released from the hospital
dr. @entity4 and @entity5 were given @entity26 , an experimental drug
to leave isolation , two blood tests on the @entity10 patients must come back negative for the virus
