-- pope @entity1 is being painted as a humble and simple man , but his past is tinged with controversy surrounding topics as sensitive as gay marriage and political atrocities			1
questions linger about @entity1 ' actions during the nation 's dark days : the so - called @entity12 , when @entity13 was ruled by dictators			1
the gay marriage issue came to the forefront during @entity1 ' political fight with @entity13 's president			1
the conservative pontiff may hold firm on some issues , experts say , but he may be flexible on others			0
" if you think that ( @entity1 ) is n't going to change anything , you 're wrong , " said @entity23 , a retired doctor who knew @entity1 during his early years in the priesthood			2
" but is he going to approve of gay marriage tomorrow ? no. " five things to know about the new pope do n't be surprised , @entity23 said , if the new pope shows flexibility on contraceptives , but do n't expect him to budge on the @entity33 's opposition to abortion			0
there 's been no shortage of praise for @entity1 as a passionate preacher and pragmatic man who prefers public transportation to private cars			1
it goes to his reputation as an independent thinker			0
but look deeper into @entity1 ' history to see a more complicated man who 's been formed by the times he 's lived in			1
dark times possibly the darkest period during @entity1 ' rise to power took place when he served as the nation 's top @entity52			2
in 1976 , during @entity13 's dictatorship , the navy kidnapped priests @entity56 and @entity58			1
some have accused @entity1 , then provincial superior for the @entity61 , of not doing enough to assert his influence and free them			2
they were found five months later			0
the incident led to rumors and allegations that @entity1 was complicit in the dictatorship 's appalling atrocity -- that he did n't do enough to expose it and perhaps was even partly responsible for the priests ' prolonged detention , said @entity72 , a former @entity73 ambassador to the @entity74			1
although the allegations against @entity1 have never been proved , they continue to haunt him , so much so that the human rights group @entity77 in @entity13 opposes @entity1 ' selection as pope			1
situations relating to the priests ' kidnappings " have not been clarified , " said the group 's director , @entity80			0
many of the allegations against @entity1 were researched by @entity13 journalist @entity86 , who wrote a book about the church 's role during the dictatorship			1
in a 2010 column , @entity86 alleged that @entity1 had lied under oath during an investigation into the theft of babies from prisoners during the dictatorship			2
@entity1 testified that he never knew about the baby - stealing until after the dictatorship had fallen , @entity86 wrote , but a victim @entity86 interviewed claims that @entity1 knew about it at the time			1
she said she had written to @entity1 about it			2
@entity72 said there 's no evidence to support the allegations			0
from public transport to @entity108 : @entity1 's journey to top of the church the @entity74 pushed back friday against the accusations			1
the rev. @entity112 , a @entity74 spokesman , dismissed the claims as false and defamatory			1
" the campaign against ( @entity115 ) @entity1 is well known and goes back to many years ago			2
it was promoted by a defamatory publication , " @entity112 said at a @entity74 news conference , using the name that @entity1 used before he became pope			1
@entity13 judicial authorities questioned @entity1 once , but nothing was imputed against him , @entity112 said , adding that @entity1 denied the allegations against him			1
" his role is well noted on how he promoted reconciliation in @entity13 , " he said			2
the fight then there 's the fight between the archbishop and the president			0
in 2010 , president @entity130 led a battle to pass a bill to legalize gay marriage			0
@entity1 , then archbishop of @entity134 , put himself right in the middle of the fight , calling the proposed legislation " a destructive attack on @entity139 's plan			2
" with a front - page counterpunch , the president said the church possessed " attitudes reminiscent of medieval times and the @entity145			0
" the bill eventually became law , and @entity1 left the battlefield defeated			2
but some supporters hold it up as evidence of his traditionalist views			0
perhaps it 's no surprise @entity130 gave @entity1 a rather dry congratulations after his election , said @entity156 , an @entity13 political analyst			1
the president failed to even mention that @entity1 is the first pope from @entity13 or the @entity159 , a signal that her government may feel at odds with the church			1
first @entity166 pope ' very exciting , ' faithful say was it a snub ? @entity156 said @entity1 " was a critic of corruption , of social inequality , drugs , human trafficking , which in reality was n't an agenda of confrontation , but that the government perceived as an agenda of confrontation			0
" @entity23 , the retired doctor who knew @entity1 during his early years in the priesthood , interpreted the war of words differently			0
@entity1 was not lashing out at just the bill but at what he saw as a larger effort by the government to divide the country along political lines			0
this is why the cardinals selected him , @entity23 said : @entity1 does n't fit into a mold			0
" they can be progressive or conservative , " he said			0
" but they 're not dumb			0
" @entity0 's @entity196 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity74 says claims about @entity1 during dictatorship are false , defamatory
@entity1 has a long record as a church *leader*
he is *lauded* by many as a humble man
others question his role during @entity13 's dictatorship
