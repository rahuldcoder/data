@entity3 shows the comedian had scheduled for february have been canceled : february 8 in @entity5 , february 21 in @entity6 and february 22 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
no reasons were given for the @entity6 and @entity7 cancellations			0

@entity21 , editor - in - chief of @entity22 -- the concert tour publication -- says it 's been challenging to keep track			0
" it seems like they 're falling like dominoes , one at a time , " he said			0
" the whole thing has gotten a lot shorter than it was			0
" the concert cancellations are the latest complications for @entity2 , who has been the subject of numerous sexual abuse allegations			1
the current tour , which began last fall , has felt reverberations from the allegations			1
twenty - four women have spoken with @entity0 , have asserted their allegations on camera or in published accounts , or have been the subject of responses from @entity2 's attorneys			1
@entity0 has not been able to independently confirm @entity2 's accusers ' allegations			1
while his attorneys denied the initial accusations , they have n't responded to more recent allegations , including the two newest ones in february			1
no charges have been filed against @entity2			2
nevertheless , some venues have canceled @entity2 's shows , including halls in @entity58 ; @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 ; @entity64 , @entity65 ; and @entity66 , @entity67			1
reasons have been terse : the @entity59 show was canceled " by mutual agreement , " a representative said at the time , and @entity72 said it had canceled two shows in consultation with the shows ' promoter , according to a note from the venue			2
" it 's a dance that the promoter does with the venue and with @entity2 himself , " @entity21 said of the considerations that go into cancellation decisions			2
there might be contractual obligations , deposits and even -- given the demonstrators who have shown up at some venues -- concerns about public safety , he says			0
@entity2 's @entity93 show draws protests for example , at @entity2 's @entity96 , @entity97 , show , about 100 people came to protest the comedian			2
" why would you want to pay to see a rapist ? " demonstrator @entity100 asked			0
@entity2 was also heckled at two @entity104 shows			1
however , though not selling out the halls , @entity2 has received plenty of support as well			2
the @entity96 venue was about half - full , but the audience was said to be generally appreciative			0
" i do n't believe he 's been charged with anything , and at least in this country , you 're innocent until proven guilty , " @entity110 said , adding that the protesters and hecklers did n't spoil a thing			0
at his november show in @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity2 received a standing ovation			2
@entity21 observes that , despite the bad publicity , @entity2 's tour has been fairly successful			1
for the calendar year of 2014 -- which includes several months before the accusations went viral -- @entity22 's numbers show that @entity2 's tour had $ 10.8 million in ticket sales over 101 shows			1
his ticket sales averaged about 2,200 per venue at about $ 57 each			0
in other words , not bad			0
" his shows were selling ok			0
he 's making great money at that sale level , " @entity21 said			0
@entity2 's website , @entity136 , no longer lists tour stops , though a list can be found elsewhere on the @entity139 ( including on @entity22 's website )			1
