-- " i learned that courage was not the absence of fear , but the triumph over it			0
the brave man is not he who does not feel afraid , but he who conquers that fear			0
" @entity10 for @entity12 it was a depressingly familiar soundtrack : the monkey noises , the name - calling , the crude racial stereotyping			1
he 'd always ignored it in the past , and for 25 minutes of @entity18 's match with lower league @entity19 in early january this year he 'd done the same			1
but then something inside him snapped			0
the 26 - year - old picked up the ball and propelled it in the direction of his abusers before storming from the field of play , followed by his teammates			1
the game was over and @entity12 's protest transformed this exhibition match into headline news around the globe , plunging football 's authorities into crisis management mode			1
" i could hear from the crowd some monkey noises and this went on for about 25 minutes			0
every time i touched the ball i could hear the crowd , " @entity12 told @entity6			1
" i said to myself , in this kind of environment , in this situation , i do n't want to play football anymore			0
" i came to the dressing room and i was the first , and saw one ( teammate ) , then the second one and then the whole team came			0
i was really surprised and then really proud			0
i thanked all of them for following me			0
" after not even 10 minutes i had , like , 86 phone calls on my phone and i thought something had happened , but it was just an unbelievable impact			0
it went all around the world within the first hour			0
" the authorities react @entity12 's actions were applauded and condemned in equal measure but , undeniably , they forced the game 's authorities to stand up and take notice			1
as recently as 2011 @entity66 president @entity65 told @entity6 that on - field racism did n't exist in football and that those who thought they 'd been abused during a game should simply shake hands upon the final whistle and move on			1
he later insisted his comments had been misinterpreted and underlined his commitment to fighting racism in football and society			2
but while @entity65 insisted that walking off the field was the wrong way to tackle discrimination , there 's no doubt @entity12 's protest provoked the head of world soccer 's governing body into decisive action			1
a task force against racism and discrimination was formed , with @entity12 invited to join ahead of its first meeting on may 6			1
it formulated proposals that would see any player or official found guilty of racism banned for five matches while teams could be docked points , expelled from competition or even relegated for persistent offenses			2
those recommendations were ratified at @entity66 's recent congress in @entity104 and were hailed by the task force 's head @entity105 as a " defining moment " in soccer 's fight against racism			1
@entity12 was also invited to the @entity111 , where he told the @entity112 that racism was a " dangerous disease			1
" @entity118 , @entity117 football 's governing body , went further than @entity66 , implementing a minimum 10 - match ban for racist abuse by players or officials and escalating measures for clubs including fines and stadium closures for repeat offenders			1
but although football 's authorities have now adopted a stronger stance to combat what has long been an ugly stain on the game , the picture on the ground is more clouded			1
@entity6 contacted more than 15 @entity117 football associations asking a series of questions on the prevalence of racism			2
one of only a handful who replied , the @entity144 fa , said they do n't have any record of racist abuse cases in their country			0
this despite @entity148 being fined $ 26,000 by @entity118 for racist abuse directed at @entity150 , then a @entity152 player , during a @entity154 match in 2012			1
the @entity156 club was later fined $ 39,000 in the same competition for taking to the field late after halftime			2
on the ground in @entity161 the situation in @entity161 reflects the complex nature of such an explosive topic			0
the technical director of the @entity166 , @entity167 , told @entity6 that his country 's problems with racism have been exaggerated			1
" i think people made out of this a much bigger problem than we actually have , " he said			0
" we do n't have a strategy to fight against racism in the @entity143 of @entity161 , we also do n't have a strategy in our government to fight against racism , simply because we do n't consider this a problem here			2
" he cited the difficulties they face with crowd violence as a more pressing concern , with @entity161 repeatedly warned about the conduct of its supporters , who rioted and caused a @entity188 qualifying game with @entity189 to be abandoned back in 2010			2
but the @entity161 @entity143 was recently fined Â£ 65,000 ( $ 84,000 ) by @entity118 after an ill - tempered under - 21 match against @entity191 in which visiting player @entity192 claimed he 'd been subjected to monkey chants from the crowd			1
the incident , and the fine , prompted criticism of @entity118 from the @entity199 government , whose sports minister @entity200 expressed his disappointment at the sanctions in relation to what he called " widespread racist abuse			2
" @entity167 , just like the @entity161 @entity143 did at the time , insisted the punishment was related to a brawl between the players and not to do with racism			2
passionate fans on @entity6 's visit to the @entity216 derby between @entity217 and @entity218 , notorious for the fervency of both sets of fans , there was violence in the stands , and several fires lit but no audible racism			2
reflecting the diverse nature of many playing squads within @entity117 football , @entity218 's team contained several black players who told @entity6 they 'd experienced no racial abuse since joining the club			2
but while progress has been made on the field , with players from a wide range of nationalities sharing dressing rooms around @entity117 and standing together to present a united front against the scourge of discrimination , flashpoints keep occurring in the stands , especially in @entity189			0
@entity244 was issued with a $ 186,000 fine after racist chanting from its fans during three matches in the @entity154 : two against @entity156 club @entity247 in september and november 2012 , and one against @entity248 of @entity249 in december			0
and in may , @entity12 , along with @entity189 striker @entity150 and @entity251 international @entity250 , were the targets when a game between @entity18 and @entity254 was temporarily halted as visiting fans chanted racist abuse at the trio			1
@entity150 , one of @entity117 's most high - profile black players , told @entity6 in an exclusive interview that he would walk off the field if the abuse persisted while @entity250 expressed his desire to " kill " all racism in the game			1
they epitomized a new resolve among the game 's top players to stamp out discrimination , sparked by @entity12 's actions in the small town of @entity272 in the @entity274 region of the country on that january afternoon			1
@entity12 's resolve his abusers at @entity19 were recently handed jail sentences ranging from 40 days to two months and @entity12 is convinced the past five months are proof that there is hope for the future			1
" i 'm taking care of these things because i want my son to grow up in a nice place and not in a place where he has to be confronted by racism , " @entity12 explained to @entity6			1
" but i never ever thought that if something happened like this that i would react the way i did , that was just out of the emotion and anger in that situation			0
" i would say that it 's there every day			0
it 's still there and that 's a big problem , because we are in the year 2013 and we still have to face racism			2
there are so many people who are fighting it now , and i want to be a part of that			0
" i 'm very confident			0
i had so many talks and so much support from people who want to help , who have offered their help			0
" after years of mixed messages from the top , it appears there is now an appetite to launch an assault on the outdated attitudes that still infiltrate the modern game			0
but given the recent resurgence of racist incidents in @entity117 , and the muddled picture in various pockets of the continent , the path towards zero tolerance is sure to prove painstaking			0
should the globe 's most popular sport manage to forge a way through , perhaps it will be able to point to the events of january 3 as a turning point			0
as far as @entity12 is concerned , had it been a friendly , or one of the planet 's most high - profile games his reaction would have been the same			1
" i think we should not accept and tolerate racism anywhere , in any game , whether it 's a friendly game or a @entity338 final or it 's a @entity339 final , " he said			1
" for me i would honestly do it even if it was a @entity339 final			0

@entity12 's walk - off protest marked *pivotal* moment in soccer 's racism battle
@entity18 *midfielder* left the field after being abused during match with @entity19
he now sits on @entity66 's *anti-racism* task force as authorities reacted to his protest
both @entity118 and @entity66 have passed new laws to try and *eradicate* racism from the game
