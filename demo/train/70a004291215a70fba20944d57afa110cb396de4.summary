-- the alleged gang rape of a 15 - year - old girl on the campus of @entity6 in @entity7 while 10 or more witnesses , most of them students , looked on has sparked familiar questions : " why are our kids so messed up ? " " why did n't these students try to stop the crime ? " " what 's happening in our schools ? " these are fair questions , and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers			1
the purported rape is another sad example of today 's self - absorbed and uncaring youth			2
it was the media 's glorification of violence that caused it			2
the horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop			0
but it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the @entity31 students did nothing because of the " bystander effect " : the more people involved in a criminal incident , the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it			1
unfortunately , this " what 's wrong with our children ? " approach leads to a dead end , because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools , families and students in this community			2
these perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned			0
but a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening			2
talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help			0
claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community			0
rather than demonize all teenagers in @entity6 , we should be asking another question : " what can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening ? " the answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue , one that may surprise			0
it is primarily students , the reputed problem , who can best prevent acts of violence on campus			1
make no mistake about it			0
the alleged two - hour - long gang rape on october 24 was an extreme form of school violence			1
it unfolded not far from the gym where the school - sponsored homecoming dance , supervised by school staff and police officers , was being held			1
and students , police say , largely perpetrated it			1
research since the massacres at @entity94 ( 1999 ) and @entity95 ( 2007 ) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence			1
chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses , especially violence - prone areas , during and after school events			1
according to a @entity0 report , a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions			1
she said , " i looked outside of the gym , and i saw 12 to 15 guys , sitting there , with no ids			0
the officers -- not only did they not check the ids of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus , but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either			0
" virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots			1
at @entity6 , one such spot is " a dark alley near the back side of the school , " the site of the purported rape			1
as @entity0 reported , school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area , but they were never installed			0
the alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area			0
as important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence , the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening			1
they did n't stop the purported rape at @entity31 , a skeptic might say			1
a possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it			0
. research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus			1
strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information			0
this dynamic can fuel violence , as officials say it did at @entity6			0
it can also prevent violence			0
thousands of potential school crimes , including violent ones , have been averted on campuses across the country because students alerted school officials before the crime occurred			1
students and families using a hot line in @entity180 were credited with preventing more than 206 incidents of school violence from 2004 - 06			1
as of summer 2009 , this one hot line fielded 1,687 reports that resulted in crime prevention or intervention			0
alert students have also helped prevent replays of the tragedies that occurred at @entity94 and @entity95 by tipping off school officials			1
several years ago , student reports stopped a @entity193 - style massacre plot , employing bombs , napalm and automatic weapons , at a high school in @entity198 , @entity199			0
this year , tips from students and alert teachers and police disrupted a student - massacre plot , featuring pipe bombs and firearms , at @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity7			1
since @entity94 , school shootings have been averted in @entity210 , @entity211 , and @entity212 , @entity7 , to name some others			0
and at @entity31 , it was an 18 - year - old bystander , overhearing others talking about the incident , who reported the crime			0
unfortunately , the public is largely unaware of these frequently heroic acts by high school students and their teachers because they do n't often get national media attention			1
that lack of information has helped obscure the important roles that students and their responsive teachers play in preventing school violence			1
but the evidence is clear			0
students who know what to do when they witness school violence , or when they have a strong sense of impending violence , will become anonymous heroes			1
but they need to be taught what to do , which phone numbers -- including hot lines -- to call and which school officials or police department can be trusted to act on their reports			2
students also need to feel confident that they can report trouble without fear of retribution from their peers or being called a snitch			2
it is up to the teachers and administrators who run schools to teach their students these procedures			0
they need to convince students that they will listen and respond consistently to their reports of violence or possible violence			2
yes , local police need to develop trusting relationships with students and the overall community , or nothing will be reported			2
but the job of preventing violence on campus belongs primarily , if not solely , to the schools			0
rather than wring our hands about the so - called immorality of today 's students , we should embrace them as full partners in the prevention of violence on campus			2
morality is not the issue			0
if students are educated on what to do when the threat of violence arises and are encouraged to follow the procedures , they can be trusted to do the right thing			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .			2

commentators focused on why students did n't report alleged rape , @entity291 says
studies of school violence show ways it can be prevented , he says
@entity291 : training can prepare students to alert police and avert violence
