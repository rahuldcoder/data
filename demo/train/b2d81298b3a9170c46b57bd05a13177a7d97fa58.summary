in the days after last month 's boston marathon bombings , the city was on edge			1
residents were holed up in their homes , under strict orders not to leave			0
investigators sifted through countless hours of surveillance images trying to determine who might have carried out this heinous attack			1
three days after the april 15 attack , the @entity11 identified the bombing suspects captured in surveillance images near the finish line , later identified as @entity16 and @entity17			1
suspect : @entity19 attack was payback for hits on @entity22 and a manhunt was on			1
hours after that @entity11 news conference , @entity19 and the rest of the country followed as the suspects allegedly shot and killed a @entity29 police officer in a failed attempt to seize his gun , carjacked a black @entity32 whose driver cleverly escaped at a gas station , then fled to the @entity19 suburb of @entity36 , where they were confronted by police			1
interactive map of the @entity19 attacks , manhunt now , almost a month later , two police sources have shed new light on exactly what happened when police confronted the two suspects in @entity36 during the early hours of april 19 , triggering a gun battle unlike anything recently seen on the streets of an @entity50 city			1
among the new details from the two police sources : -- police fired nearly 300 rounds of ammunition within five to 10 minutes as they confronted the suspects -- 100 more than initially reported			1
and that included one round that nearly killed @entity59 police officer @entity58			1
( @entity61 bullets struck the @entity17 brothers , seriously injuring @entity17 and contributing to the death of @entity16			0
) -- @entity16 was the only brother armed with a handgun			0
the only other weapons they had were the homemade explosives that police say the brothers tossed out of the hijacked vehicle , including a few that detonated			1
-- police accidentally fired on an unoccupied black suv during the mayhem			1
" in the chaos , an officer or trooper ( or some combination of personnel ) mistook it for one of the two suspect vehicles , " @entity75 of the @entity68 told @entity76			0
@entity19 fire chief gets vote of ' no confidence ' in handling of bombings in the beginning , all police knew just before 11 p.m. thursday , april 19 , was that a man was down in @entity92			1
they would later learn that @entity29 campus police officer @entity94 had been shot and killed in his patrol car			2
a short time later , at least half a dozen police agencies responded to a call from help from the @entity99 , after an officer spotted two cars that the @entity102 were driving			2
the officers converged on the narrow residential intersection of @entity106 and @entity107 streets in @entity36			1
the @entity17 brothers were in the middle of the street , after lobbing the homemade explosives			0
law enforcement sources told @entity76 that the only other weapon the brothers had was a single handgun used by @entity16 , but investigators have not confirmed that			2
the final hours that paralyzed @entity19 " we have not commented publicly on that and i 'm not in a position to do so at this time , " @entity75 said			2
" obviously , that is part of the investigation			0
" the extraordinary gun battle played out in front of @entity126 , who captured photos of the scene on his iphone from his upstairs apartment on @entity131			0
in one image taken by @entity126 , the two suspects are crouched behind the black suv as they engage in gunfire			2
@entity126 said the two men had been transferring bags from a green sedan that one of the brothers drove to the scene			0
at one point , @entity16 approached police on foot , with explosives on his body and an explosive trigger , firing his handgun at the officers who returned fire , mortally wounding him			2
a police officer tackled him , then handcuffed him on the ground			2
around the same time , @entity17 grabbed the wheel of the hijacked suv and drove toward the police			2
" as soon as the suv turned around in the street , " @entity126 told @entity76 's @entity155 , " it was accelerated gunfire			0
" source : @entity159 withheld details about @entity17 at some point , @entity17 was shot and wounded			0
as he drove the suv toward the officers who had restrained his brother , the police scrambled out of the way and @entity17 proceeds to drive over his brother			2
@entity16 later dies from the gunshot wound and the blunt force trauma of being run over , according to his death certificate			0
several hours later , a seriously injured @entity17 was arrested a few blocks away in @entity36 , where he was hiding underneath a covered boat in someone 's backyard			1
@entity68 and the @entity174 district attorney 's office are investigating the entire sequence of events that night , beginning with @entity94 's death in @entity92			0
" that shoot review , which is ongoing , will include examination of any potential friendly fire incidents , " @entity75 said			0
while @entity58 was the only officer seriously injured in the @entity36 shooting , another officer was also grazed by a bullet			1
in high - pressure situations , police often experience " contagion shooting , " a former @entity185 , @entity186 , police chief said			1
and that 's most likely what happened in @entity36			1
what did suspected bomber 's widow know ? " if you look back at some of the other cases in the past , then it immediately causes a contagion and other people start shooting , " said @entity195 , now an associate professor of criminal justice at the @entity197			0
the gunfight in @entity36 was so intense that bullets came flying through a home about a half a block from the shooting scene			1
" they landed right near our staircase , near the pedestal and the other near our closet , " said @entity210 , who showed @entity76 several bullet holes in his house			0
" they went through one , exited , went through another closet and landed under the staircase			0
" the chaos in @entity36 that led to the friendly fire shooting of @entity58 can be compared to a war zone , @entity195 explained			1
" things ( that ) occur in the very dynamic moments of a situation like this ... are not necessarily -- no matter how hard police work -- what they are trained to do , " said the former police chief , noting that none of his remarks are intended as criticism of police			0
@entity237 concurred with that comparison : " considering the chaos and the battlefield conditions -- where a pair of homicidal terrorists were firing shots and throwing bombs at police -- the fact that friendly fire incidents might have occurred detracts nothing -- not one bit -- from the valor exhibited by the police officers and state troopers present that night , " the @entity68 spokesman said			0
