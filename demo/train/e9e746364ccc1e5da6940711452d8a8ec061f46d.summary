@entity0 -- @entity2 speaker of the house @entity3 drew a hard line in the sand this week , renewing a battle over the debt ceiling unless president @entity9 agreed to significant budget cuts during what may be a lame - duck session after the november elections			1
this could set the stage for a dire scenario that threatens to bring the government to a crawl by @entity19			2
but brinksmanship tactics from both sides are not new -- in fact , they are all too commonplace on both sides in this @entity24 as the value of the compromise among moderate voices has all but disappeared			1
and it appears many voters want it that way			0
fiscal cliff : what you need to know what may be different today is that , as the country looks around for reasonable , moderate statesmen and women on both sides to go behind closed the doors and broker a deal , their choices are becoming more limited			0
congressional moderates , it seems , are a dying breed			1
where once such names as @entity47 and @entity48 in the @entity49 symbolized bipartisan compromise in @entity24 , today the slow end of the compromiser has been hastened in part by frustrated voters who in polls say they are tired of political infighting and legislative gridlock			1
but these are often the same voters have recently shoved aside longtime moderates in favor of more extreme candidates			1
just ask @entity65 sen. @entity64 of @entity66 , the centrist @entity2 who after 35 years in office was defeated by tea party favorite @entity68 last week in the @entity2 primary			1
or discouraged @entity72 moderate sen. @entity71 , who is retiring this year after being frustrated with the lack of compromise in the @entity49			1
or any of the @entity76 who were voted out in 2010			1
" the electorate is frustrated			0
the response is to vote for those who stand up and say ' i 'm not like the rest of these guys , ' " said @entity79 , a resident scholar at the @entity80 and co-author of the book " it 's even worse than it looks : how the @entity65 constitutional system collided with the @entity89			1
" @entity49 's all - day budget debate dominated by politics @entity24 has a 78 % disapproval rating , according to an analysis by @entity94			1
the distaste for @entity97 politics has been demonstrated in recent elections across the country where moderates were ousted in favor of candidates who vowed to take a tougher line on upholding party values			2
@entity68 's @entity106 page boasts a string of congratulatory nods from conservatives and an ominous warning from those who voted for him			2
" remember to represent the @entity66 not forgetting us , and what we @entity114 stand for , " voter @entity112 wrote			0
" @entity64 forgot we are the bible - belt @entity117 christian values , and that we believe in our constitution which he took an oath to uphold and defend but instead did his best to destroy			0
" @entity64 backed portions of the @entity9 administration 's energy and immigration agenda and even supported the president 's @entity127 choices			0
when he lost a recent primary battle to the far more ideologically rigid @entity68 , @entity64 fired off a statement harshly criticizing the increasingly polarized political climate			2
" if that attitude prevails in @entity65 politics , our government will remain mired in the dysfunction we have witnessed during the last several years , " @entity64 wrote			1
@entity136 : grow up , @entity24 -- make a deal on debt @entity71 grew so fed up with the current climate in @entity0 that she decided not to run for a fourth term			1
sen. @entity141 , @entity142 ; sen. @entity143 , @entity144 ; sen. @entity145 , @entity146 ; sen. @entity147 , @entity148 ; and sen. @entity149 , @entity150 , are centrist - leaning lawmakers who are also retiring			0
" people are just stunned by the debilitating partisanship , polarization and the overall dysfunction of the institution and political paralysis as we come , you know , to the point of extreme when it comes to resolving the problems facing our country , " a frustrated @entity71 told @entity1 in february			0
" it 's become an @entity164 and that failure has eroded the public 's confidence about the direction of this country and about governing institutions to be at the front lines of solving these problems			0
" in states and districts that slightly favor one party and have been traditionally represented by moderates from the opposite party , the very lawmakers viewed as " problem solvers " are tossed out in favor of those who promise change , @entity79 said			2
during the 2010 midterm elections , for instance , roughly half of the @entity183 , a group of moderate @entity76 who largely hail from conservative leaning @entity186 and @entity187 districts , were voted out of office			1
former @entity65 rep. @entity191 , @entity192 , knows the perils of such trends all too well			1
despite his reputation as one of the most fiscally conservative @entity76 -- he voted against and promised to help reform the health care reform law -- @entity191 was unable to fend off a 2010 challenge in his @entity2 - leaning district by @entity200 , who was backed by the tea party			2
" it 's difficult for @entity24 to draft legislation that makes sense for @entity65 because we are ideologically driven on both sides , " @entity191 said			1
" it 's really difficult for these folks to come together for a compromise			2
you 'll hear members say , ' i have to watch my base			0
' " the current era of partisanship was ushered in by former house speaker @entity216 , @entity79 said			0
although the former @entity2 presidential candidate would say he and former president @entity219 cut deals that led to a record budget surplus and the biggest economic boom in modern @entity65 history , many say the @entity192 @entity2 's ideologically unyielding , take - no - prisoners brand of leadership ushered in an era of heel - digging politics that persists to this day			1
but ideological stubbornness may be just one ingredient in the recipe for congressional paralysis			0
throw in congressional redistricting , which has made it more difficult for moderates to run and win			2
legislation that sails through the @entity237 is often dead on arrival in the @entity49			0
even issues that appear to have bipartisan support -- such as capping student loan interest rates -- get stuck in the goo of @entity24			1
next , add primary rule changes that only allow registered party members to vote and a polarized electorate whose grassroots efforts have put tremendous pressure on lawmakers to stay true to a more narrow interpretation of party values			0
then sweeten it with the rise of more partisan - leaning media that allows voters to only consume news skewed to their own political views			0
the result : danger for moderates on both sides of the aisle			2
" you put all of that together , and you have a toxic stew , " @entity79 said			0
" it 's deeply rooted			0
it metastasizes into states where the extreme elements are getting stronger			0

many moderates in @entity24 are either leaving office or being voted out
the *looming* battle over the debt ceiling is an *opportunity* for a compromise that may not happen
most @entity65 have a *negative* view of @entity24 and its inability to get things done
