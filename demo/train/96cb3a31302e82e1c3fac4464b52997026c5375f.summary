@entity1 , @entity0 -- new @entity4 president @entity3 says peace is possible if @entity7 president @entity6 is in the right mood			1
" sometimes , the position of mr. @entity6 is quite pragmatic , sometimes it is very emotional , " @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity9 on thursday in an exclusive interview , his first broadcast interview since taking over as @entity4 's leader on june 7			1
" i just try to find out the time when he is more pragmatic than emotional			2
" he said negotiations with @entity7 separatists in eastern @entity4 would continue on friday , the day his unilaterally declared cease - fire expires and the day that he also will sign a cooperation agreement with the @entity20 that sparked the crisis in his country			1
escalating conflict ? the talks are intended to end fighting between the @entity27 - backed separatists and @entity4 military and militia forces that threatens to escalate into a broader conflict			0
" i am optimistic and i 'm thinking that within a few weeks , maybe months , we can have a deal to establish peace , " @entity3 said in the interview with @entity9 while he was in @entity1 for @entity20 talks that will include signing the cooperation agreement between @entity34 and the former @entity36 satellite			1
with the signing occurring the same day @entity3 's seven - day cease - fire expires , concerns increased of further unrest in parts of eastern @entity4 and economic retaliation by @entity6			1
asked by @entity9 if he was the person who could forge a peace deal with @entity6 , @entity3 said that was his goal			1
" i 'm ready to make peace with anybody " " i 'm ready to make a peace deal with anybody , " he said			1
" i want to bring the peace to my country , not because we are weak , not because we are less patriotic than anybody			0
we are ready to defend my country because i hate the idea not to use the last opportunity to bring the peace to the region			0
" @entity7 and @entity4 have been engaged in a tense standoff since march when @entity7 annexed the previously @entity4 peninsula of @entity61 and massed troops along other parts of its border with @entity4			1
in an effort to calm the situation , @entity3 declared a cease - fire last week in @entity70 's fight against @entity72 separatists , but the violence continued			0
on thursday , a @entity4 national guard base came under attack in @entity79 , @entity76 @entity75 unit spokesman @entity74 said			0

two days earlier , @entity4 authorities said pro-russia militants shot down a military helicopter in eastern @entity4 , killing nine			0
@entity3 told @entity9 that friday 's negotiations , which will include @entity34 officials , must show some progress before his unilateral cease - fire expires at the end of the day			1
he seeks a commitment to negotiations , the release of hostages , a cease - fire and the withdrawal of @entity7 - backed forces from @entity4			1
the @entity98 , which operates a special monitoring mission in eastern @entity4 , said thursday that four members of a @entity79 - based team of @entity98 monitors apparently held by separatists had been released			0
without @entity7 withdrawal , " it is a real war " " all the troops on @entity4 territory are @entity7 , they are @entity7 citizens , " he said , adding that separatist leaders were from the @entity7 secret service			2

" asked what would happen without a sufficient response from the other side , @entity3 only said he would make that decision friday			2
on wednesday , @entity7 's upper house of parliament voted , at @entity6 's request , to revoke the president 's right to use troops in @entity4			1
the move appeared to be an effort by @entity6 to defuse tension before friday 's watershed @entity4 - @entity20 moment , which @entity6 opposes			1
@entity3 called signing the agreement with the @entity20 the second-most important moment in his nation 's history , ranking only behind independence			1
" geographically we are already in @entity34 , " he said , adding that @entity4 connected with @entity34 values			0
asked whether he was worried about a negative economic reaction on @entity6 's part , @entity3 said the @entity7 president recently promised not to undertake such steps			1
" he promised that we will have a negotiation in a trilateral format , together with a @entity20 representative , so we do not expect any immediate negative reaction , " @entity3 said			2
at the same time , he made clear that in his mind , the @entity7 annexation of @entity61 -- which has an ethnic @entity7 majority -- can not stand			0
" @entity61 is @entity4 " calling the issue a top priority , @entity3 declared : " @entity61 is @entity4 and the whole world confirmed that @entity61 is @entity4			2
" peace talks involving representatives from all sides occurred wednesday in the @entity4 city of @entity79 , @entity4 's official @entity151 news agency said			2
those participating included @entity4 government officials , @entity72 separatists from the restive eastern @entity160 and @entity79 regions , @entity7 officials and members of the @entity98			2
meanwhile , @entity164 secretary of state @entity163 said the @entity164 and @entity34 plan on possible further sanctions aimed at specific sectors of @entity7 's economy , depending on what choices @entity27 makes ahead			0
" it is critical for @entity7 to show in the next hours , literally , that they are moving to help disarm the separatists , to encourage them to disarm , to call on them to lay down their weapons and begin to become part of a legitimate political process , " @entity163 said thursday after meeting with @entity170 foreign minister @entity169			0
