-- a @entity2 man is recovering in the intensive care unit friday , a day after surgery that completely removed from his right leg a tumor twice his body weight , according to the hospital in @entity10			1
the growing tumor had rendered the patient , @entity12 , virtually immobile until his surgery			1
the excised tumor weighed 180 pounds ( 82 kilos ) , according to the hospital , a bit less than the 200 pounds ( 90 kilos ) estimated before surgery			1
@entity12 , 31 , of @entity17 , has @entity19 's neurofibromatosis , said dr. @entity20 , chief executive officer of @entity21 , where the 12 - hour procedure was performed			1
the autosomal dominant hereditary disorder is the same disease that contributed to the extraordinarily large head of @entity26 , whose story was dramatized in the 1980 film , " @entity28 , " explained @entity20			1
( last july , according to the @entity31 , its researchers identified the gene variant in @entity34 syndrome and plan to test @entity35 from @entity26 's skeleton to determine if @entity34 caused his disfigurement			2
) the tumor , which originated in @entity12 's spine , " may return , " @entity20 wrote in e-mails to @entity0 , " but we can operate him again , and it wo n't never reach such a size anymore			1
" doctors expect that @entity47 's cardiac and pulmonary functions will return to normal during the next 10 days			1
after that , @entity12 faces rehabilitation , physical therapy and possible help from the hospital 's clinical psychologist to deal with issues pertaining to body image , @entity20 said			2
" this patient lived all his life with this tumor			2
it was part of him			0
" @entity12 also needs to learn how to do things that his body had forgotten , including using the left leg he had never used normally , @entity20 added			0
the tumor was first discovered when @entity12 was four years old and had grown to its enormous size since then			2
@entity12 had undergone a surgery to amputate most of his leg -- and with it the tumor -- in 1997 , but in 2001 , the tumor grew , and no doctors agreed to operate on him , according to the hospital			1
@entity20 said he did not know why the leg was amputated , as there are no medical records from that time			0
furthermore , his family could not afford surgery , and very few surgeons in @entity2 can treat neurofibromas , @entity20 said			0
the latest surgery was considered risky with a 50 % success rate for a number of reasons , @entity20 explained			0
" first , such a giant tumor has developed its own blood system with huge arteries branched out from the normal vascular system			2
therefore , one of the main risks was abundant bleeding			0
" doctors used a " cell saver , " which suctions and filters the patient 's blood before re-injecting it into the body , along with extra blood for the surgery			0
the second and third risks lay in heart function ( " how would a heart react when a tumor with twice the weight of a patient is removed ? " ) and the effects of a long -- more than 13 hours -- anesthesia , @entity20 said			1
leading the surgical team was dr. @entity109 , a specialist in plastic and reconstructive surgery from @entity112			0
@entity109 has been credited with removing a 200 - pound tumor from a woman in the @entity116 state of @entity117 in 2000 , as well as a 176 - pound ( 80 kilo ) tumor from a @entity120 woman in 2004			1
aside from @entity109 , no one else on the team had any prior experience with @entity47 's condition or performed such a surgery before , @entity20 said			1
" though the surgical techniques used by dr. @entity109 are usual and routinely used by our surgeons , the difference lays in his experience : he knows what to expect and what to do at specific crucial moments			0
" finally , the team of @entity2 surgeons and anesthetists had never worked with @entity109 before , and communication issues could turn dangerous in an operating theatre , @entity20 said , adding that two of the three @entity2 surgeons also go by " dr. @entity142			0
" nonetheless , the communication among all in the operating theatre went " extremely well , " @entity20 said			0
during the surgery , @entity21 set up a live video feed for other doctors and hospitals to watch			0
video during the surgery showed five people assisting in the disposal of the excised tumor from its own gurney into a yellow container , which was then sealed			1
a small piece has been sent for examination ; the rest will be incinerated as with all biological waste , @entity20 said			0
the cost of the surgery was estimated at $ 20,000 , but the hospital said it will charge 60 % of the cost , which will be covered jointly by the @entity165 of @entity17 and sponsors			2
the hospital said it is financing all the traveling costs and accommodation for @entity109 , who is performing the surgery free of charge .			2
