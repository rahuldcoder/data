-- the image of the empty factory has haunted @entity4 presidential campaigns for decades , but president @entity5 tried to flip the picture thursday night			2
" i 've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers , goods that are stamped with three proud words : made in @entity4 , " @entity5 said as he accepted the @entity15 nomination for a second term			1
" after a decade of decline , this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years			1
" that may sound surprising in an era where unemployment remains stuck above 8 % long after the official end of the 2007 - 2009 recession , so @entity0 took a closer look			2
the facts : @entity4 manufacturing jobs peaked in the late 1970s , according to figures from the @entity4 @entity29			1
the figures bounced up and down through the 1980s and 1990s before starting to drop steadily in 1998			0
the sector employed 15.6 million in january 2002 , according to @entity29 statistics , down from about 19.5 million in 1979			0
they declined steadily through the next 10 years , falling to just under 11.5 million in january 2010			0
but then the numbers turned around , rising to 11.9 million at the beginning of 2012 and just under 12 million as of july			0
but while the turn has been positive , the numbers of workers being hired each month are well below the figures posted a decade ago			0
new hires averaged about 400,000 a month in 2001 , compared with about 250,000 in 2011			0
and as with other statistics cited during the three - day @entity15 convention , it 's not quite the whole picture			1
manufacturing sector employment is still down by about 500,000 since @entity5 took office and by more than 3.7 million since the start of the recession in december 2007			1
conclusion : @entity5 's statement is technically accurate , and he and other speakers took great pains to acknowledge the still - struggling recovery			2
but while the return to growth in manufacturing is indeed a promising turn of events , employment in the sector is still at a net loss during @entity5 's tenure			1
fact check : the $ 2,000 question fact check : about those 4.5 million jobs ... fact check : trimming the @entity66 @entity0 's @entity67 and @entity68 contributed to this report .			0

manufacturing jobs reversed a long *slide* in 2010
@entity5 *touted* that *turnaround* in his @entity15 convention speech
but employment in the sector remains far below its *prerecession* peak
