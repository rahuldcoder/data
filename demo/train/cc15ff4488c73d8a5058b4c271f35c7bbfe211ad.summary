-- in the next week @entity1 will launch a satellite to coincide with the 100th birthday of @entity4 , the late " great leader , " and the man perhaps most responsible for the reclusive state 's status as the world 's most irresponsible country			1
but @entity4 's " birthday present " also means @entity1 's people will have to forgo 240,000 metric tons of food aid from the @entity12 , as well as the prospect of further negotiations aimed at bringing their country in from the cold			1
there are no good options for how we should respond			0
there never are with the @entity1			1
but working closely with our partners is a good place to start			0
we must ensure the launch strengthens our partnerships rather than weakens them			0
it is difficult at this point to assess what happened to make the @entity1 essentially renege on the deal			1
many analysts have made the case that this is typical @entity1 behavior			2
that is true , but with an important caveat : the @entity1 usual way of doing things is first to pull out of a negotiation over some issue that would not be an issue among normal countries , but becomes a deal breaker for this " exceptional nation			1
" @entity1 parades launch pad for world media after a period of time , the @entity1 tend to follow up their effective walkout with a provocative act such as a missile test			1
in the case of the february 29 agreement , however , the negotiations had hardly broken down			0
by all accounts the atmosphere was good			0
the process was very much on track , and -- dare one use a word that should not be used in the context of @entity1 negotiations -- there was optimism			2
optimism that finally the momentum was being cranked up			0
another far more spurious explanation has been to blame the victim , in this case , the @entity12			2
the idea is that the @entity12 negotiators , having conducted months of painstaking preliminary work including with the @entity70 and the @entity71 , somehow failed to nail down a clear pledge from the @entity1 , to the effect that a so - called space launch would be on the proscribed list			1
@entity76 warns against provocation this farcical argument , prevalent among those who have convinced themselves that they would have been more competent than the @entity12 negotiators , has been " confirmed " by the @entity1 themselves -- surprise , surprise -- who deny the launch was even mentioned in negotiations			1
besides , the @entity1 view their space program as a kind of @entity90 of their own , and how could anyone think the launch was anything but their own contribution to the peaceful exploration of space ? a far more likely explanation is that -- surprise , surprise -- @entity1 did not have its act together			1
the people negotiating the food aid were not the same as those launching the missile			0
presumably , the rift was civil - military , with the former more interested in feeding its people than the latter			0
one can imagine as well various conspiracy theories to explain the situation			0
after all , even dictatorships experience political struggles			0
with a free - for - all political scene , pitting the boy - dictator - wannabe , buttressed by his ambitious aunt and often antagonistic uncle , against a grouchy and arrogant military establishment , it could well be that the agreement was scuttled as part of an ongoing battle to settle personal rivalries			0
the standard of living in @entity1 's upper aristocratic nomenclature may not be much better than that of a @entity129 taxi driver , but it 's state power that counts , not just the supposed access to luxury goods			2
some will say we have little choice but to wait and watch , and perhaps harvest the intelligence trove that may , so to speak , fall our way			0
military solutions are least desirable , but so would be the prospect of a @entity1 rocket falling on the soil of an ally , unopposed by an anti-missile system			1
we must protect our allies from a missile threat			0
looking beyond the immediate crisis , we need a strategy that addresses any concerns that @entity12 's allies may have that our nuclear umbrella is not enough			1
we must continue to work closely with @entity71 politically and diplomatically			1
we failed to do that in the early 2000s , with one consequence being that many @entity71 began regarding the @entity1 as our victims rather than one of the world 's miscreants			2
we have worked closely with @entity70 , but perhaps it is time for that ambitious nation , so preoccupied by its internal affairs of late , to step it up and start attaching some sense of urgency to addressing the problems caused by its support for a country that would not last a week without it			2
above all , we need to remain patient and calm with the resolve to understand that we can not walk away from the problem			0
we need to work with others and strengthen the regional partnerships we have -- and will need -- if the @entity1 problem is ever to be solved			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			2

@entity1 says it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite this month
other countries say the move is a cover for a *ballistic* missile test
hill : @entity12 must work closely with its regional partner to resolve the crisis
