-- a year ago sunday , @entity1 crashed while landing at @entity3 's airport , killing three passengers and injuring 187 more			1
survivors remember the incident , in which the plane clipped a seawall just short of the runway , spun violently for 330 degrees , broke into pieces and caught fire			1
it all occurred on a clear day			2
" it was like we were all bouncing all over the place			1
i just remember there being dust everywhere , and i was freaking out and then it just stopped , " said @entity17 , 15			2
said another passenger , @entity21 : " and there was no wind , no fog			2
i 'm a regular at the @entity3 airport			2
so , yeah , it was so shocking that we could miss the runway by so much			1
" the crash marked the first time that the new @entity31 , one of the most sophisticated airliners , was involved in a fatal crash			2
since then , another @entity31 , @entity35 , disappeared after takeover from @entity37 on march 8			2
authorities have yet to solve the mystery of what became of the plane carrying 239 passengers and crew			1
in the @entity47 crash , one of the three people killed was @entity48 , 16 , who died on the ground when she was apparently hit by a rescue truck responding to the scene , according to the @entity53 coroner			0
a subsequent video suggested that at one point emergency workers saw @entity48 's body on the tarmac during the chaos			0
but a january report by @entity3 authorities asserted that @entity48 was already dead when two fire trucks ran over her on the airfield			0
earlier this year , a lawyer for @entity48 's family said a video shows that several firefighters saw her lying on the tarmac , but none " did the basic step of checking if she was alive			0
" the teenage girl was on her way to an @entity74 summer camp from her home in @entity76 when the crash happened			1
last month , @entity74 safety investigators determined that the pilots erred on the approach and landing of the plane			1
also contributing to the disaster was crew training and the complexities of a key flight system on the @entity31 and how it was described in operating manuals , the @entity83 found			1
investigators , however , primarily faulted the crew of the @entity92 - based carrier for not fully executing intricate systems of the jetliner packed with more than 300 people			1
the flight crew mismanaged the plane 's descent being carried out without the help of navigational instruments , and one of the pilots unintentionally deactivated a system that automatically regulates airspeed , the board 's final report said			1
the crew also delayed its decision to abort the landing with the plane flying too slowly to avoid catastrophe , investigators found			1
of the 307 people on board , almost 200 of them were taken to local hospitals with injuries such as bruises , broken bones and spinal damage			0
@entity121 broke his jaw and injured his back and hip			0
a year later , he 's still dealing with the fallout			0
" i 'm grateful that i 'm still alive			0
the problem is the consequences change some of my life , " he told @entity0			0
" i could n't really do much normal activities and work as before			0
" the flight originated in @entity131 , @entity76 , made a connection in @entity133 , @entity92 , and then flew 10 hours to @entity134			0
pilots blamed for @entity47 crash @entity0 's @entity137 contributed from @entity3 .			0
