president @entity0 said sunday that the @entity1 " ca n't accept " last week 's killing of 12 people at @entity5 's @entity4 as " inevitable , " but the shooting should instead " lead to some sort of transformation " on gun violence in the @entity1			1
" it ought to be a shock to all of us , as a nation and as a people , " @entity0 said at the @entity11 , just a few short blocks from the @entity4			1
" it ought to obsess us			0
it ought to lead to some sort of transformation			0
" the president said during his speech that grieving with the families impacted by mass shootings is something he has had to do five times in his presidency , citing shootings in @entity31 , @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 ; and now the @entity4			1
" part of what wears on as well is the sense that this has happened before , " @entity0 said			1
" what wears on us , what troubles us so deeply as we gather here today , is how this senseless violence that took place in the @entity4 , echoes other recent tragedies			2
" the president continued : " sometimes i fear there is a creeping resignation ... that this is somehow the new normal			0
we ca n't accept this			1
" twelve people were killed and eight were wounded when @entity55 , a @entity4 contractor , entered the sizable naval instillation in @entity5 and opened fire in @entity59			1
the victims , whose ages ranged from 46 to 73 , all worked at the @entity4 and many were gunned down as @entity55 shot at them from above in the @entity4 building			2
the issue of gun violence has dominated much of @entity0 's second term in office , with a concerted effort to strengthen gun laws coming after 26 people -- including 20 children -- were killed at @entity72 in @entity37 in december 2012			1
' there 's a guy slaughtering people with a shotgun ' the push , however , eventually failed , with the lawmakers on @entity79 failing to pass any laws tightening gun restrictions			2
groups including the @entity83 and @entity84 vociferously protested the proposed changes			0
in response to last week 's shooting at @entity4 , most gun - control advocates were resigned to the fact that not much in the of legislative changes would be made in response			1
" we do n't have the votes , " said senate majority leader @entity93 , a supporter of gun control , on tuesday			2
" i 'd like to get them but we do n't have them now			0
" the @entity83 , in response to the shooting , on sunday suggested more armed guards at military installations			0
@entity0 attempted to take what he saw as acceptance of gun violence head on , worrying that mass shootings could not become the " new normal			2
" " i do not accept that we can not find a common - sense way to preserve our traditions including our basic @entity118 freedoms and the rights of law - abiding gun owners while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis , " @entity0 said , pointing to the fact that other countries , like @entity108 and @entity109 , lowered gun violence by restricting access to guns after mass shootings rocked their country			1
throughout much of the speech , the president acknowledged a hesitance in @entity5 to fight over gun laws and , instead , said change would need to come because of the @entity1 people 's desire for it			1
who were the victims ? " it may not happen tomorrow , it may not happen next week , it may not happen next month , but it will happen , because it 's the change that we need , " the president said			0
@entity0 also used the speech to give a glimpse into the life of each of the 12 victims , mentioning everything from @entity145 ' love of polishing his white @entity146 to @entity148 's last words to his wife : " good - bye , beautiful			1
i love you so much			0
" " our tears are not enough , " he said to the families			2
" our words and our prayers are not enough			0
if we really want to honor these 12 men and women , if we really want to be country where we can go to work and go to school and walk our streets free from senseless violence without so many lives being stolen by a bullet from a gun , then we 're going to have to change			0
we 're going to have to change			0
" @entity5 , mayor @entity165 joined @entity0 on sunday in calling for tighter gun laws in response to the shooting , telling the audience that " our country is drowning in a sea of guns			1
" in taking the stage , @entity0 was stepping into a role he has become very familiar with , counselor - in - chief , and sunday 's remarks were reminiscent , in some ways , of past speeches he has given at memorial services for mass shootings			1
reframing the gun control debate : is mental health the next focus ? @entity0 , however , is not the first president to play the role of counselor - in - chief			2
presidents @entity187 and @entity189 were praised for the leadership they showed in the aftermath of two domestic disasters -- the space shuttle challenger explosion in 1986 and the @entity196 bombing in 1995			0
representatives from the military , including secretary of defense @entity199 , secretary of the navy @entity201 and vice adm. @entity203 , commander of @entity204 , also spoke at sunday 's event			0
all honored the fallen by noting that they died in the line of duty , just like those killed in battle			1
" these 12 members of our @entity4 team , our @entity4 family , were killed in the line of duty , they died in the service to our nation , the service to our @entity4 , service they were just as committed to as anyone in uniform , " an emotional @entity203 said			1
" for that service , we honor them			0
for that service , we will never forget them			0
" opinion : tackling the military 's insider threat			0
