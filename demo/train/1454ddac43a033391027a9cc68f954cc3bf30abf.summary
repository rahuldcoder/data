-- from hot air balloon to hang - gliding operators , plenty of airborne adventure outfits promise to let you " soar with the birds			2
" few , however , deliver on the claim quite as literally or dramatically as @entity9 's @entity8			1
an activity in which humans fly alongside beautiful @entity14 vultures , parahawking is one of the more sensational flight experiences on the planet			1
flights take off from the lakeside town of @entity20 -- a jumping off point for whitewater rafting , mountain biking and other adventure activities in the @entity9 's @entity26			1
thanks to the perennial presence of thermal gusts of air , traditional paragliding is an established and popular activity in the @entity32			0
many paragliding outfits operate tandem flights in the area			0
but only the @entity8 offers two flight companions -- mine were named " @entity38 " and " @entity39			2
" @entity40 was my human guide			2
like most @entity14 vultures , @entity39 , did n't say much , but was extremely handsome , with sharp eyes and an adorable spiked hairdo			1
the founder of @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity40 employs two @entity14 vultures , his preferred breeds in the air , to accompany paragliders in flight			1
( @entity39 's feathered colleague is named " @entity52			0
" ) inspiration strikes over beers like other birds , @entity14 vultures conserve energy while flying by seeking " thermals " -- rising currents of warm air that occur when the sun heats the ground			1
thermals are also important to paragliders , who use them to stay aloft for longer periods of time			1
parahawking involves using trained birds to locate thermals			1
human paragliders follow the birds as they fly , rewarding the birds with a piece of meat after they 've been guided to a thermal			1
" the birds land on the passengers ' gloved hand for an inflight reward , " according to the @entity8 website			1
the idea of using vultures to lead paragliders first came to @entity40 in 2001			1
@entity40 says inspiration struck over beers with the man who kick - started @entity9 's paragliding industry			1
" the more beers we had , the better the idea seemed , " he says			0
" luckily , it still seemed like a good plan in the morning			0
" taking flight though a few other operators around the world have begun offering parahawking flights , @entity40 , who says he 's always been " a bird guy , " says his project is the original			1
in the eight years since the tandem flights with vultures took off , @entity40 has had a number of interesting experiences			2
one involved a client with no arms for the birds to land on -- a fact the man failed to mention until go time			2
then there was the vegan who decided , after jumping , that she could n't bear to touch the buffalo bait			2
the best part of the job " is when a passenger is reduced to tears as the bird comes and lands on their arm during a flight , " says @entity40			2
magical experience standing on a cliff on a sunny morning , @entity40 hands me a long leather glove			0
this will be @entity39 's perch when he alights midair on my arm			0
his motivation will be the raw buffalo meat tucked into my fist			1
the whole parahawking experience , which lasts about 30 minutes , is surreal			0
with 8,000 - meter , snow - capped peaks reflecting in the lake below , the views from the sky are phenomenal			0
when @entity39 finds us a strong thermal , we quickly follow and ascend , and then he 's called over for a reward			0
sheer joy overwhelms the senses when sharing the skies with a bird at 2,000 - plus meters			0
the concept is simple , the feeling magical			0
conservation efforts in @entity20 , parahawking is roughly twice the price of a standard tandem paragliding session			1
from the â ‚ ¬ 125 ( $ 170 ) parahawking fee , however , 1,000 @entity9 rupees ( about $ 10.50 ) are donated to vulture conservation projects in @entity9			1
@entity154 is just part of @entity40 's mission to educate people on the value of vultures and threats posed to their existence			0
he 's also helped established the @entity162 , a community - managed safe vulture feeding site near @entity20			0
tourists sign up with the " restaurant " and those lucky enough to receive a forthright " cow dead " text are invited to see the birds devour a carcass			0
the parahawking season runs from about october to april			0
bookings are made through the @entity8 website or at the @entity176 paragliding office in @entity20			0
the @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity20 , @entity9 ; +977 98066 47917 @entity180 is a freelance writer based in @entity181 .			2
