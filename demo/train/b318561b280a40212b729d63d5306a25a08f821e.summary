@entity0 -- you do n't need to peek at @entity4 's long list to know what the @entity5 is asking for this holiday season -- a large , nicely wrapped box of bipartisanship			1
the ideal gift would come fully assembled , with members of @entity11 ready to reach across the aisle and " budge on some deeply held positions , " as president @entity14 said earlier this week			1
but compromise is easier said than done because , as incoming house speaker @entity21 points out , " there 's a reason why we have @entity19 and @entity20			1
we believe in different things about the appropriate role of the federal government			2
" even the president had to admit that history is not on his side			2
" it 's no secret that we have had differences that have led us to part ways on many issues in the past , " he said			2
that said , the midterm elections changed the dynamic in @entity0			1
it also forced @entity14 to admit to a " shellacking , " and it led to the so called " slurpee summit			1
" that meeting on tuesday with @entity11 leaders from both parties in the @entity41 lasted only about two hours , and did n't end with a dinner in the private quarters as @entity14 had initially hoped			1
however , there was one major concession : the president admitted privately to @entity20 that he had not reached out to them enough in the first two years of his administration and he vowed to do a better job			1
it was a mea culpa after months of dismissing criticism that he had not done enough to foster bipartisanship			2
@entity5 spokesman @entity53 said the president did n't apologize , but " took responsibility for that , " and told @entity20 he was " ready to do his part			1
" the proof , as they say , is in the pudding			2
the next few days in this lame - duck session of @entity11 will truly determine if the summit both sides described as " frank " and " useful " will produce a compromise on bush - era tax cuts , the new start treaty or a repeal of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
but a new effort at bipartisanship seems to be getting off to a rough start			1
on wednesday , @entity74 @entity20 promised to block every legislative action until the @entity74 had moved to fund the government and extend tax cuts			1
forty - two @entity20 senators signed a strongly worded letter to senate majority leader @entity80 of @entity81 , who promptly blasted the @entity20 for trying to " obstruct " and " delay , " legislative progress			1
@entity74 @entity84 : take up tax cuts first but @entity20 strategist @entity86 blames democrats for wasting a lot of time on issues that " do n't have the votes to pass , " and are " not priorities for the @entity94 public			1
" " the scoreboard shows time running out , " he said , " and @entity80 and [ outgoing house speaker ] @entity96 are just running in circles			2
" one thing is certain : @entity94 overwhelmingly want both sides to get along , but do n't have much confidence that they will			2
in a recent @entity105 - @entity104 survey , 72 percent of registered voters said they wanted congressional republicans to work with the president and their @entity19 counterparts to get things done			0
but just 28 percent thought that would actually happen			0
that pessimistic view seems at odds with a more optimistic tone at the @entity5			0
the administration is convinced that the midterm elections narrowed the options and might just force results			1
" next year the @entity5 will be controlled by the @entity20 , the @entity74 by the @entity19 , and the presidency obviously unchanged , " @entity53 said			1
" to make progress on issues , to get legislation through @entity11 , it 's going to take bipartisanship			2
" @entity53 dismissed doubts that the president 's ambitious agenda could get wrapped and delivered over the next two weeks			0
when a reporter wished the @entity5 good luck , the @entity5 spokesman responded , " well , thank you			0
you 'll have a lot to cover			0
" the top priority is the @entity135 - era tax cuts			0
both sides are eager to ink a deal , but they remain entrenched in their long - held views			0
senate minority leader @entity140 of @entity141 wants them extended not only for families earning $ 250,000 or less per year , but also for wealthier @entity94			0
" we ought to treat all taxpayers the same , " he said			0
but the president said the country ca n't afford the $ 700 billion dollar price tag in extending the cuts to wealthier @entity94			2
" i continue to believe that it would be unwise and unfair , " he said			0
polling shows about half of @entity94 favor extending the tax cuts for families making less than $ 250,000 while a little more than a third favor extending them to all @entity94			0
how will @entity20 and @entity19 be able to bridge this wide divide ? @entity14 appointed treasury secretary @entity158 and his budget director @entity159 to negotiate with four members of @entity11 from both parties			1
the goal is to find common ground in the next few days			0
during a break in their wednesday closed - door session , @entity158 told reporters that discussions were " very civil " and " constructive " and that there were " no surprises			0
" but it 's unclear how much progress is being made because the group agreed not to discuss those details			0
past divided governments have managed to avoid gridlock and produce results			0
in president @entity183 's second term , key accomplishments like welfare reform , a balanced budget and trade agreements were sealed with bipartisan support			0
now , both sides have signaled they 're willing to work together to give @entity94 what they asked for on @entity187			0
@entity86 said the ball is in @entity14 's court			1
" he 'll see bipartisan success if he moves past his singular emphasis on style and actually looks for ways to meet @entity20 on cutting spending and targeting the deficit , " he said			2
the clock is ticking as the holiday break approaches			0
it seems progress will hinge on @entity0 being much less naughty and a bit more nice .			1
