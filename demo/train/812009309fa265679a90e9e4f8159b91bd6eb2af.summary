-- might there be a @entity4 / @entity3 situation this awards season ? with the announcement of nominations for the @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity11 ' fans had plenty to cheer about			1
she received nods for her performance in the new @entity17 drama " how to @entity18			2
" but " scandal " actress @entity19 , one of the darlings of awards seasons past , was nowhere to be found			1
is it a case of there being room for only one @entity29 - @entity28 woman to be celebrated ? it 's not a new concept			2
in 2005 , @entity4 invited fellow supermodel @entity3 onto her talk show for a conversation about the tension between them			0
the fashion industry was partially to blame , @entity4 said			0
" back then , there were 10 top models ... but there was an unwritten rule that only one of them could be black , " @entity4 said			0
" and @entity3 was that one black girl			0
" @entity3 added in 2013 , " it does irk me that two women of color have to be pitted against each other			0
... i 'm very proud of @entity4 and what she 's done with ' @entity49			0
' i 'm proud of her ; i 'm proud to know her			0
" likewise , model @entity52 told @entity54 in 2003 that when she arrived in @entity58 in 1975 to model , she " learned that magazines would only use one black girl at a time , and they were trying to create a competition between us			0
" @entity59 has received plenty of acclaim for her work in films and began drawing even more awards buzz from almost the moment she debuted as tough - as - nails law professor @entity67 on " how to @entity18			2
" @entity68 , meanwhile , has reigned as a fan favorite during the four seasons of her hit show " @entity73			1
" in 2013 , she was saluted for being the first black woman to lead a weekly tv series since @entity77 starred in " @entity78 , " which premiered in 1968			2
@entity68 's absence from this year 's nominations was very quickly noted			1
@entity82 , executive editor for tv for @entity84 , tweeted , " another early morning , another awards snub for @ kerrywashington			1
i 'm getting tired of complaining about it			0
" another fan tweeted , " and again how is @ kerrywashington not nominated for @ @entity90 ? ! it 's baffling to me			2
congrats on the nom @entity11			1
" writing for the wrap , @entity94 noted wednesday that the @entity8 nomination for @entity59 but not @entity68 may have illuminated the lingering diversity problem in @entity98			1
he said it was not that @entity68 was n't deserving this time around , because " at the top of the game for tv 's dramatic actresses , she should have been a shoo - in for a @entity8 nomination again this year			1
" " of course , @entity68 's nomination history for a @entity8 award is n't as deep as the one she has for the @entity109 , which she received nominations for in 2013 and 2014			1
and the @entity9 also saw fit to nominate her only once before , in 2014 , just like the @entity113 , " @entity111 wrote			0
" but if it 's true that there 's only room for one black leading actress in the run for awards , then @entity98 is n't as progressive - minded as we believe ourselves to be			1
" both shows are tied to @entity122 , who holds the distinction of being the most powerful woman of color in @entity98			1
@entity127 rules thursday nights on @entity17 , with " scandal " ( which she created ) and " how to @entity18 " ( which she executive produced ) airing back to back			0
known for building in diversity , both of color and of sexuality , into her projects , @entity122 told the @entity137 in september that she saw nothing unique in the lineup			1
" i 'm not sitting around going , ' wow , it 's historic to have two black women on television , ' " @entity122 said			2
" i do n't think it 's odd to see two black women standing in the same place because , well , that 's my house			2
like , it 's not a thing			0
to me , it just feels like tuesday			0

@entity11 was nominated for awards this season , but @entity19 @entity68 was not
both star in tv shows tied to producer @entity122
maybe @entity98 is n't as progressive as it thinks , one writer says
