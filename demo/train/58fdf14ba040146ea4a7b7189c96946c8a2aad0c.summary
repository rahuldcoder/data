-- it had never been done before , but as @entity3 gunned the engine of his @entity6 motorbike and prepared to land it in an open boxcar of a moving train , he was strangely calm			1
@entity10 putting his motorcycle through its paces			1
rather than fret for his own life , he was thinking about the responsibility he had for the life of the woman sitting on the saddle behind him			2
he laughs to tell the story now , but his moving - train stunt for @entity23 's 2008 @entity22 vehicle " @entity24 " was perhaps the most dangerous @entity3 's attempted in his 25 years in @entity25			1
his career has involved many films , including " @entity28 , " " @entity29 , " @entity30 and the @entity31 " and portraying @entity32 's stunt double in " terminator 3 : @entity35			1
" that 's right : @entity3 is a stunt man			1
in fact , he said that after completing that train stunt , which involved probably more math than we 'd care to compute ( consider a man jumping 70 feet on a motorbike at 60 mph from a ramp into an open car of a train traveling at 45 mph , all with a woman on the seat next to him ... sounds a bit like a @entity51 question , does n't it ? ) the footage showed he missed			1
in actuality , he came too close -- or about 6 inches -- to one of the boxcar 's doors			2
so , he had to do it again			2
" i have to time it with a girl on my back , " @entity3 said			2
" too short , i 'm dead			2
too late , i 'm dead			2
too high , fast or powerful , i take my head off			2
it had to be perfect			2
while he did n't sleep for two nights before the stunt , he says a strange type of calm precedes any of his attempts at a difficult trick			1
then , just before launch , he says , as he revs the engine of whichever " boss hog " he 's riding that day , his adrenaline kicks into gear			2
" i get that feeling , that i could wrestle 10 gorillas , i could jump 10 trains , and boom ! i go for it			2
" @entity3 completed the stunt , this time " hitting " it almost exactly through the middle of the box - car 's open gate and the movie 's production team wrapped the scene			1
" i did it again and just hit it perfect , " he said			2
" i hit the impossible stunt			1
" it did n't start this way @entity3 grew up in @entity92 , not far from @entity25 , where from the age of 10 he ripped around the largely rural area on motocross bikes before he graduated onto some seriously heavy machinery -- including his own super-modified @entity6 that packs a 350 @entity98 car engine			1
that gave him a perfect start in his chosen career of motorcycle stunt riding			1
@entity103 autos : fastest coupes under $ 30k he got into @entity25 by ditching the small - town naysayers who did n't believe in him , he says , and traveling to @entity108			1
after a couple misfires , he looked into a stunt school he found in a @entity25 trade publication and he found his calling			1
@entity103 autos : top 10 best car commercials perhaps more importantly , @entity3 met his wife , also a stuntwoman			1
" ( @entity116 ) changed my life and stopped my drinking , " he said			2
" i told her , ' if we 're gon na get married , i got ta have a career			1
' " in addition to traveling to @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , and all over the world , the couple raised four kids on a 10 - acre ranch about 25 miles north of @entity25 in @entity130			1
@entity3 has n't touched a drop of alcohol in nearly 25 years			1
he says he often takes his grandkids for " wheelies " around his neighborhood			0
as it turns out , stuntin ' runs in the family : his 17 - year - old daughter is a champion horse show - jumper and is gunning for an @entity141 place , but is already a professional stuntwoman			1
@entity103 autos : @entity146 's ' @entity145 ' engineers important new car stunt work is n't something to be taken lightly , though			1
@entity3 has the scars to prove it			0
he says he 's broken " almost everything			1
" everything , according to @entity3 , includes both of his arms , legs , knees , feet , ankles , several of his ribs , his back and his pelvis			1
but , his background in gymnastics has left him some flexibility			0
@entity103 autos : most common car - related injuries perhaps philosophically , @entity3 points out that the most important thing for any stuntman , alongside having a particular niche or forte like motorbike riding , is learning from the mistakes you 'll inevitably make			1
sometimes this means knowing when to say no and , simply , when to go for it			0
he recalls the time he was cajoled by a director into doing a motorcycle stunt he considered too dangerous			1
" the worst thing ( i ever did ) was on a @entity182 series 13 years ago in @entity183			0
i had to jump off a pier , over the water and into a barge			0
well , usually they give you a lighter bike mocked up to look like a @entity6 , but they would n't do that ( for ) this so i had to get a stock @entity193 1200 @entity195			0
i could jump a 35 - foot distance ( on that bike ) but from pier to barge was now more than 35 feet			1
i checked the tide and the jump was 40 feet long			1
" now ( i know ) i do n't want to do it			0
but the production manager came running out and said , ' if @entity3 does n't do this jump , you all are going home right now			0
' he was really throwing it at me			0
i did the jump and landed perfectly , but the bike snapped in half and crushed my ankle			0
in the hospital , the ' doc said they were gon na have to cut my foot off			0
" @entity3 's foot was saved by steel plates and screws , but not before he learned an important lesson : " it 's not the fact of making mistakes in life , it 's what you learn from them			0
" he describes a later stunt where he had to jump a motorbike down 2.5 stories from a roof , jumping through a window , all while wearing a rubber monster suit			1
he says the lights were bad , and he " could n't see a thing			0
" " i called down to floor , said i could n't see the ground , " he said			0
" they said ' you wimp , my mother could do that			0
' but , five minutes later the lights were right , and i landed it			0
the end result was i had learned from my mistakes			0
there are ways to get around anything			0
" one tough assignment most famously , perhaps , @entity3 portrayed @entity32 in " @entity247 , " a role that still has a special place in his memory ( although he says he 's back working with his old terminator team on a " major blockbuster " to be filmed this summer )			1
@entity103 autos : top 10 movie car chases " for @entity247 , i got a call to double @entity32 , to go in and meet him			1
we hung out for six months , riding together and training			0
now ( as a double for the ) @entity259 , i ca n't be riding and looking , or turning my head			0
i had to use peripheral vision for all my stunts			0
" not that he needed a reminder , but @entity3 's @entity259 experiences proved once again that stunt work is serious business			1
" in one of the sequences , @entity32 's riding on a motorcycle and the lady 's on a crane			0
she swings at him and he grabs the crane			0
but that transfer was not as sweet as it looked			0
riding at 45 mph , following the crane , a harness was supposed to bring me closer to the crane and lock me safe to it			1
but , the crane made a swerve and it pulled me off the motorbike , and he 's still going			2
picture a fish on the end of a hook , being swung around			0
if that timing was off i would ( have been ) wrapped around a pole and torn in half			0
" on the same shoot , @entity3 had to do battle with an object much larger than him and perhaps less forgiving than a moving crane			2
" for an explosion shot in the movie , i was heading right toward a tanker , " he said			0
" i swerved around ( it ) and was head on with a remotely controlled ambulance , ( which was ) on fire			1
if i had fallen and it would of hit me , i would have been bone dead			0
" but , it landed beside me -- a full - weight paramedic truck flipping through the air			2
i talked to the guy on the remote control after that			0
he said it would have landed on top of me , but on the last second it turned to the right and missed me			2
" unless you 're @entity3 , do not try this at home			0
you might get squished .			0
