-- in the war against regulations and government restrictions , proponents have argued that it would be better for our economy to let the market rule			1
if we just get government out of the way , the market would determine business winners and losers and more jobs would be created			2
it 's an appealing , red - blooded , @entity16 - sounding pitch			0
but what are the practical outcomes of such a policy ? let me tell you what the outcome would have been for me			0
i am the @entity16 portrait of a small - business success story			2
@entity26 might have started in a garage , but my business started in a renovated gas station at the corner of @entity32 and @entity34 streets in downtown @entity35 , @entity36			0
that 's where @entity38 and i opened @entity40 with a $ 12,000 investment , $ 4,000 of it borrowed , on may 5 , 1978			2
we were two college kids ( well , one of us dropped out ) who just wanted to have a small ice cream store in a university town			1
but the popularity of our product led us in 1980 to dream bigger			0
we began packing pints and hand - delivering our ice cream to local grocery stores and restaurants			1
our reputation grew and in 1983 , independent ice cream distributors started selling our ice cream in @entity55			1
by 1984 , our micro-enterprise small business grew to more than $ 4 million in sales			2
the big ice cream brands were n't happy			1
that year , @entity59 , owned at the time by @entity61 , had enough of our upstart small business			1
did they try to promote their ice cream harder , develop some new flavors or cut prices to competitively beat us ? no. their game plan was to try to stop our distributors from carrying our ice cream			1
@entity61 , a $ 4 billion corporation back then , was a major source of income for these distributors and they were told , in no uncertain terms , not to do business with @entity40 's			1
this is what letting the free market reign really means			0
if you are a big business and do n't want competition from small companies , you just use your economic clout to shut them down			2
fortunately , the government does restrict this practice somewhat to protect the little guy			0
it is called the federal antitrust law			0
we believed @entity61 's actions were illegal under this statute , which says a company that controls a major share of a given market can not use its power and economic strength to keep other businesses out of the market			1
@entity40 's filed a lawsuit against @entity61 , but we also created a " what 's the doughboy afraid of ? " customer campaign because we knew that in a strictly legal fight , we would run out of time and money long before @entity61 did			1
the legal action and the negative publicity for @entity61 worked			0
the doughboy agreed to stop trying to block sales of our products			1
the law was on our side , but we were fortunate to have a unique consumer product with a good customer base to advocate for us			0
had @entity61 taken their anti-competitive actions earlier , @entity40 's today might be just a local @entity36 treat or , more than likely , not be around at all			1
regulations and government restrictions , like the federal antitrust law , help create a level playing field for entrepreneurs and small businesses wanting to grow			2
they establish the rules of business that allow real competition to work for the consumer and give small businesses a fighting chance			2
without regulations and government restrictions , the biggest company wins			0
anyone with a dream of starting a business to become the next @entity40 's wo n't have that chance			1
that is not the @entity16 way			0
we understand the concept of fairness and that might does n't make right			0
that is why the current anti-regulation efforts in @entity145 are so dangerous			0
letting the market determine the rules of the business world means there will be only one rule : the biggest guy with the deepest pockets wins			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			0

@entity155 : politicians ' *mantra* is get government out of business , let market forces rule
@entity40 's ice cream would never have survived in that **environment** , he says
@entity155 : when his business was small , @entity61 tried to block sales of @entity40 's
@entity155 : only biggest businesses survive in an *unregulated* , *cutthroat* **environment**
