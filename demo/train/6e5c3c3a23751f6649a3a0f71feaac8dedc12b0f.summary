aerobatic stunt teams will provide @entity2 's international airshow with entertainment , but the real dogfights for billion dollar contracts take place behind closed doors			1
the world 's third biggest aviation event takes place later this month , a mix of trade conference and national flag - waving with a whiff of kerosene and big money in the air			1
the main players in the civil aviation industry will be in town , with announcements on new sales from the big plane makers expected , plus @entity25 's flagship carrier @entity24 rumored to be set to announce new additions to its fleet			1
apart from the airline industry workhorses and business planes for the global jet - set , the event is also a grand bazaar for airborne weaponry where makers of combat aircraft and defense department bigwigs meet to talk shop and see some of the multi-million dollar hardware in action			1
" there are high ranking generals walking around these events , " says @entity42 , managing editor of @entity43			0
" sometimes they are walking around in full uniform and happy to be noticed			0
it 's about being seen and building international partnerships			2
" but away from the gold brocade and gleaming aircraft on show , the aviation industry , both military and civilian , does n't have quite the same lustre			1
it faces the same problems as many other export industries , that of slow growth and the need to find new markets			0
the @entity64 , @entity65 and western @entity67 countries dominate the manufacture of weapons , but against a backdrop of @entity64 defense cuts and a recession - haunted @entity67 , they are no longer the main markets for sales			0
" in @entity67 it 's pretty much stagnant , " says @entity42			2
" if anything ( @entity67 countries ) are trying to offload the equipment they 've got , interestingly to developing countries because that 's where the money is , " says @entity42			2
not all @entity67 defense departments are taking on the role of second - hand car salesmen , but the need to cut back or suspend deals means that more than ever @entity88 , @entity89 and the @entity90 are prime targets for arms companies			1
between 2006 and 2010 , six of the ten largest importers of weapons came from the @entity95 , according to a report from the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , and companies from the west will be hoping that trend continues			2
" there have been some large scale acquisitions in the ( @entity88 ) region , " says @entity101 of @entity97			1
" in @entity106 , @entity25 and @entity2 there have been significant naval and combat aircraft orders , " he says			1
" suggestions are that some of these acquisitions are looking at @entity111 as defense posturing , but also ' keeping up with the @entity113			0
' we do see that tendency in that region			0
" @entity117 has been the worlds biggest recipient of combat aircraft for the past six years and is unlikely to cede that title soon			2
it is expected to announce who will supply its new fleet of multi-role fighter jets in the next few months and the battle between companies for the estimated $ 20 billion contract has raged for years			1
the recent news that @entity133 's @entity132 jet is the cheaper option and preferred bidder could save the @entity137 company that had been rumored to be in financial trouble for failing for find a single export order for its jet			1
one of the big draws at this year 's show and on display will be the @entity144 -- the only game in town , says @entity42 , when it comes to the next generation of fighter jet			1
while it has had some setbacks in development , @entity42 believes they have mostly been overcome and is set to a big winner for the company			2
but it will have to be , he says			0
" it 's a big project			1
to achieve the cost figures they 're looking at , around $ 57 million per aircraft once full production is going , they 're going to have to get as many customers as possible			0
" while @entity88 countries including @entity111 , @entity164 and @entity117 are developing their own fighter planes it will be a long time before they can compete with the established players in the industry from @entity67 , @entity65 and the @entity64 , believes @entity42			1
instead a big area of development and procurement is in unmanned drones			0
the @entity64 and @entity172 dominate the market for those with strike capabilities , but the capacity for other countries to develop smaller unmanned aerial vehicles is growing			0
" you see them cropping up almost everywhere , " says @entity101			0
" countries like @entity182 that you would n't normally assume to be a significant arms producer are looking to set up cooperative production arrangements so they can produce their own			0
from tiny things that can be launched by hand to the largest systems ; it 's cost effective rather than manned vehicles			0
" if the aircraft are getting smaller , the skies and aviation marketplace are set to become more crowded while manufacturers hope the deals will remains just as large .			0
