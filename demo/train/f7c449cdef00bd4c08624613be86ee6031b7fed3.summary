@entity0 charred ground and cinders mark the sites where once thousands of homes stood			2
that 's according to a series of satellite images released thursday by @entity9 , which the rights group said shows the " horrific scale " of the devastation wrought by @entity14 militants			1
as they 've trickled out , accounts of the bloody attacks on the northern @entity18 town of @entity19 and surrounding villages have shocked even those all too used to reports of violence by @entity14 militants			1
witnesses told how the attackers sped into the town on january 3 with grenade launchers -- their gunfire and explosions shattering the early morning calm			2
some terrified residents fled , while others took refuge in their homes -- and were torched with them			2
local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as 2,000 people			2
but authorities have yet to access the remote area near the border with @entity41 to get a full picture			2
@entity9 said that satellite images taken on january 2 and five days later " provide indisputable and shocking evidence " of the extent of the destruction in @entity19 and neighboring village of @entity19 , also known as @entity47			1
the before - and - after images demonstrate that the attacks left more than 3,700 structures damaged or destroyed , the rights group said			1
more than 3,100 of those were in @entity19 , which was " nearly wiped off the map , " it said			2
other nearby towns and villages in @entity58 were also targeted in the series of attacks that started on january 3			2
" these detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns , one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days , " said @entity61 , @entity0 researcher for @entity9			1
" of all @entity14 assaults analysed by @entity9 , this is the largest and most destructive yet			1
it represents a deliberate attack on civilians whose homes , clinics and schools are now burnt out ruins			2
" many of the wooden fishing boats that can be seen along the shoreline in the images of @entity19 from january 2 are gone in the later images , the group said			2
this agrees with witness accounts of desperate residents fleeing by boat across @entity41			2
another rights group , @entity89 , has also published satellite imagery that it said showed the results of fires set by @entity14			1
the rights group said 11 % of @entity19 and 57 % of @entity47 were scarred by the flames			0
asked by @entity1 about the @entity9 satellite images , @entity95 , coordinator of @entity0 's @entity96 , said , " this is a government that analyzes any and all sources of information			1
" @entity9 last week described the massacre as possibly @entity14 's " deadliest act " yet			1
the @entity18 military said that description was " quite valid			0
" " the attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since january 3 should convince well meaning people all over the world that @entity14 is the evil all must collaborate to end , " it said			1
@entity0 's government has called for @entity14 to be seen as a problem requiring a concerted international response , as seen after the terrorist attacks in @entity119 last week			1
on wednesday , a new message surfaced from @entity14 's leader , @entity121 , in which he praised again and again the deadly rampage at the @entity125 offices in @entity126			1
" @entity0 has always said this is a global challenge and viewed as such requires global military action , " said @entity95			0
" the combatants we capture are often not even @entity18			0
they do n't even speak our languages			0
what started as copycat attacks is now a newly devised network			0
" the government has come under fire from critics who say president @entity138 is more interested in campaigning for the presidential election next month than in dealing with the problem of @entity14			1
soldiers who spoke to @entity1 in northern @entity0 painted a troubling picture when asked about their efforts to take on the @entity145 extremist group			0
they said @entity14 outgunned and outnumbered the military on the battlefield			1
while the militants are equipped with anti-aircraft guns on the backs of trucks that have a range of three - quarters of a mile , they have only @entity157 weapons , with a range of a few hundred yards , the soldiers said			0
adding to their difficulties , they are issued only 60 bullets when they go into battle , they said , while the @entity14 fighters have many more			1
many soldiers also have to buy their own uniforms and lack protective gear , they said			0
morale is low , and this is one of the reasons that @entity14 is making gains on the battlefield , they said			1
responding to the claims that the military is outgunned , @entity95 said : " @entity0 is in the process of acquiring new equipment and we will continue to intensify those efforts			0
" in a rare piece of good news , @entity18 soldiers thwarted a @entity14 attack wednesday in the town of @entity183 , in southern @entity58 state , the military said			1
the @entity185 said five terrorists and two anti-aircraft guns were captured			0
officials gave no casualty tolls , but residents told @entity1 that at least 40 @entity14 fighters were killed when @entity18 soldiers surprised them and fought a lengthy gun battle			1
@entity95 said , " we 've always said this is an ongoing process			0
we 're happy that this success has come in quick succession to @entity19			0
we hope more will be achieved			0
" the continuing violence has displaced many people from their homes			0
of the 30,000 people displaced during the attacks around @entity19 , 20,000 camped in @entity202 city , capital of @entity58 , while another 10,000 headed to @entity204 , nearer @entity19			0
others were stranded on @entity206 on @entity41			0
" these people are adding to the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees , who have already stretched the capacity of host communities and government authorities , " @entity9 said			1
" @entity9 is calling on the governments of @entity0 and @entity41 to ensure these displaced people are protected and provided with adequate humanitarian assistance			1
" @entity14 has terrorized northern @entity18 regularly since 2009 , attacking police , schools , churches and civilians , and bombing government buildings			2
it has also kidnapped students , including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in april -- and remain missing			0
the @entity145 group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of @entity227 law across @entity0 , which is split between a majority @entity229 north and a mostly @entity232 south			0
@entity1 's @entity233 reported from northern @entity0 , and @entity234 reported and wrote from @entity235			0
@entity1 's @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
