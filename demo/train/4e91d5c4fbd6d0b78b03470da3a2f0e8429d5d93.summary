@entity0 -- the world 's military shopping list is being exposed through the @entity5 publications			0
state - of - the - art missiles and @entity8 military helicopters are a frequent topic of discussion in the diplomatic cables posted online sunday by @entity5			1
the documents show a keen interest in what weaponry @entity14 has and how to defend against it			1
one cable found that the @entity8 ' planned missile defense system gives the public in @entity20 " a false sense of security			1
" the crown prince of @entity25 , in another cable , seems to support @entity8 missile defense systems aimed at @entity14			1
the crown prince said , according to the cable , " he would like to help further integrate the @entity29 into [ the @entity31 and @entity32 ] project because it would not be enough without everyone 's participation			0
" but the @entity37 ' concern about @entity14 was clearly the most frank			1
citing @entity14 's refusal to scale back its nuclear program and noting that " there are changes in the region that concern us , " the chief of staff of the @entity37 's armed forces told an @entity8 ambassador he wanted the @entity8 government to deploy between four and five @entity49 batteries to the @entity37 during calendar year 2009 , fearful that an @entity52 strike on @entity14 would result in a retaliatory attack on other countries by @entity14			1
@entity8 's state - of - the - art unmanned aerial vehicles also garnered a great deal of attention			2
one cable said @entity60 " requested the sale of armed @entity59 , which will be a challenge to fulfill			2
" the @entity37 also wanted @entity59 , in particular @entity61 , to protect themselves against @entity14			1
one cable said @entity65 , who is the apparent crown prince as well as deputy supreme commander of the nation 's armed forces , " again asked about the status of the @entity37 request to acquire @entity64 " the @entity8 general he was meeting with , the cable said , told the prince that the request was being considered			2
the prince reportedly told the general , " we are patient , " but added , " i hope the @entity14 give us time ; they are aggressive and are moving fast			2
" as might be expected , there also is frank discussion in the cables of the diplomatic balancing act that the @entity8 performs with its @entity80 allies and @entity52			1
an example is the discussion in a meeting between @entity8 and @entity52 military officials			1
" the @entity85 [ government of @entity52 ] continued to express concern over the f - 15 sale to @entity89 , " one cable said			1
" the @entity85 expressed additional concerns about stationing these new aircraft at @entity92 in the northwest corner of @entity89 -- close to the @entity52 border			1
" at the same meeting , the @entity52 complained about the sale to @entity97 of air - to - air missiles that could pose a threat to @entity52 warplanes			1
the @entity8 assured the @entity52 that new missiles had no greater capabilities than the older version			2
the cables indicate that @entity8 helicopters are in demand by many countries			2
@entity108 , according to one cable , asked gen. @entity109 for 12 armed helicopters			0
the cable said the issue of helicopters was a " topic that [ @entity108 president @entity115 ] would manage to insert into almost every item of discussion during the hour - and - half - long meeting			0
" @entity60 not only wants to buy @entity8 - designed military helicopters , it wants to build them , too			0
one cable spelled out a deal that @entity60 's leadership was trying to nail down to buy 16 @entity124 helicopter gunships			0
the same cable said @entity60 wants to buy an international version of the @entity128 helicopter and wants such copters built in @entity60 as well			0
the company that builds @entity138 " guarantees that it would build in @entity60 -- for sale outside of @entity60 -- one @entity133 ( sic ) for each one the @entity134 ( government of @entity60 ) builds and buys for itself ; this is a boon of hundreds of millions of dollars for the @entity60 economy , " the cable said			0
not all the discussions revolve other countries buying @entity8 weapons systems			0
another cable spells out the crown prince of the @entity37 's " interest in exploring selling the @entity37 's ' gyrocopter ' [ a helicopter - supported uav co-developed with @entity148 company @entity147 ] to the @entity149			1
" a note from the person who wrote that cable said the @entity8 would be exploring that possibility			0
other cables discuss weapons sales between other countries			0
a message to the @entity158 in @entity159 notes @entity8 anger over a @entity163 company 's sales to @entity164			0
" we have information the @entity163 firm @entity167 and its subsidiary ulis continue to sell cooled and uncooled infrared detectors to a @entity164 firm for incorporation into thermal imaging systems			0
we believe the @entity164 firm , @entity173 , is actively selling its thermal imaging systems to @entity14 defense entities			2
" the cable asks that the @entity163 government stop the sales immediately .			0
