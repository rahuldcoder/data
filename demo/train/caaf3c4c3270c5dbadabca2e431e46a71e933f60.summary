-- the agreement reached by president @entity2 and @entity3 to reopen the government and avoid default was a punt , a punt that traveled 15 yards			1
it was n't a budget agreement because nothing in it addressed any budgetary issues , nor was it a spending agreement , because spending continues at its current pace			0
it was a process agreement that saved the day , although the same fights that led to this crisis have been merely rescheduled			0
another government shutdown is looming on january 16 and the nation will hit its debt limit on february 7			1
as far as government work goes , it 's about the best we can expect			2
and that 's the problem : the failure of our government to work properly , thanks to the weak leadership and ideological , re-distributionist preferences of president @entity2 combined with a deeply divided @entity31 caucus , means we 're likely to go through the same saga again			1
it 's also a reflection of how massive the nation 's debt problem is and how difficult it will be to reduce it			2
here 's what has gone wrong			2
let 's start with the tea party			1
the tea party has been blamed more than any other group for the standoff of the past month			1
sen. @entity44 , @entity45 , and dozens of @entity46 @entity31 have taken the brunt of the blame as the image of the @entity31 has hit record lows			0
the tea party 's dedication to repealing @entity53 and shrinking the size of government , as opposed to simply slowing the rate of growth , is admirable and desirable			1
those goals unite the @entity31			2
but tea party objectives will not be achieved if it does n't change tactics			1
under our @entity63 , massive overnight change is impossible unless you win elections			2
if the tea party wants results , it needs to elect candidates who can win and deliver votes in the @entity46 and @entity72			1
in many ways , the @entity68 's fight is not with president @entity2 or with speaker @entity75			1
the tea party ca n't be president @entity2 's check and balance without realizing that under our @entity63 the president also gets to be the @entity68 's check and balance			1
the fundamental error @entity31 made in this fight was overreach			0
in trying to repeal @entity53 , @entity44 and the tea party led @entity31 into a fight that could not be won because they did not have the votes to win it			1
instead , this fight unrealistically raised the hopes of the @entity31 base for an effort that never had a chance			0
ultimately , legislation like keeping the government open or increasing the debt limit must pass , but that does n't mean anything can be attached to it			0
republicans turned a must - pass goal into a will fail effort			0
the @entity68 rebuttal ? that type of practical approach is why @entity110 is a mess to begin with			0
they say they do n't care about the politics , they ardently are trying to save the nation			0
but the nation wo n't be saved if they ca n't muster the votes to save it			0
as for president @entity2 , if he wanted to achieve a fundamental grand bargain with @entity31 , he would have done so in 2011 when an agreement with @entity31 was in sight			2
he talks like a centrist willing to break with liberal economic ideology , but from the stimulus to @entity53 to his push for tax increases , he has no record of governing like one			1
instead , he is driven to redistribute things , whether it 's income , wealth or in the case of @entity53 , health insurance			1
he views the role of government as taking things of value from one citizen so they can be given to another			0
he promised that if you liked your health insurance you could keep it			0
of course it 's not as simple as that , as people are now realizing			0
for example , some companies may be dumping part or all their health coverage as @entity53 comes online , leaving employees to pay higher premiums and in some cases getting less coverage on the exchanges , according to a @entity158 analysis			2
@entity2 says the debt is a " long - term " problem , ignoring that it has grown from $ 10.6 trillion to nearly $ 17 trillion on his watch			2
he refuses to make any fundamental changes to @entity53 but he insists that @entity31 agree to additional tax increases			1
throughout the recent impasse , he refused to negotiate			0
his poll numbers are around the worst levels of his presidency			0
the @entity169 average shows more than half the country disapproves of the way he is handling his job			0
he is an unpopular president			0
the tea party gets stuck with the extremist label , but for many , it 's @entity2 's policies that are extreme			1
unless the just completed battle has exhausted both sides and they suddenly see merit in compromise and negotiation , january will be a repeat of october			2
in that case , the only issue left is which party do the voters kick out when they realize the only thing elected officials know how to do is punt ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			1

@entity190 : shutdown deal reached by @entity2 , @entity3 was a punt that went 15 yards
he says it *'ll* likely happen again in january . @entity198 's goals admirable , tactics must change
he says tea party must realize : to win , it needs votes . that 's why it lost shutdown battle
@entity190 : @entity2 has also overreached -- with @entity53 , call for tax hike
