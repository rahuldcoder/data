a @entity1 wind farm is on track to get the first - ever permit allowing it to avoid prosecution and penalties in the event of eagle deaths from farm operations			1
the @entity9 announced thursday it expects to grant a permit to the @entity11 , a 3,500 - acre wind farm near @entity13 , @entity1 , within 30 days that would allow for the deaths of five golden or bald eagles over a five - year period without the wind farm 's operators being penalized			1
" the permit , the first of its kind , requires the company to engage in conservation measures that protect the local population of golden eagles , while providing greater regulatory certainty for the company , " the @entity9 said in a statement			1
@entity29 , which is a subsidiary of @entity31 , also produced what the federal service described as a conservation plan to help minimize the wind farm 's impact , not only on eagles , but on bats and other migratory birds , as well			1
" the @entity41 eagle permit sets a precedent for proactive and collaborative eagle conservation at wind farms in northern @entity1 , " according to a statement from service director @entity46			1
@entity47 is the @entity48 , a state program of the @entity50			2
he says the conditions of the permit are still unclear because the permit has not been issued yet			2
" we do n't like it when any bird is killed			0
we certainly do n't like it when any eagle is killed , " @entity47 told @entity57 thursday			0
but the group has supported the permits as a way to work with the industry to help it minimize the number of bird deaths on wind farms			2
" we think the permit process is one way to do that			0
" he added " we hope it provides conservation , but we do n't know if it will			0
" it 's unclear exactly how many eagles , in addition to other birds , are killed by the powerful turbines on wind farms every year			1
only a small percentage of farms actually count the birds that are killed by the power turbine blades			2
" farms are n't required to count the number of birds killed ...			0
i 've seen various numbers			0
i do n't think we really know , but it 's a lot , " @entity47 said			0
bald eagles , in particular , are protected under federal laws , even though they are no longer on the endangered species list			0
a wind farm could incur steep penalties in the event of eagle deaths			1
the @entity9 says the permits help protect wind farms from accidental eagle deaths			0
the @entity29 wind project , northeast of @entity102 , is expected to help @entity1 meet its goal of producing 33 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 .			1

the @entity1 wind farm is already in operation
sometimes eagles and other birds fly into the *massive* blades
@entity50 : " we are *cautiously* *optimistic* " about the permit
