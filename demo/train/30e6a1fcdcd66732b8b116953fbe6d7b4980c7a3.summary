@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 stepped on stage carrying a kitchen sink to battle against a team of hundreds of @entity1 consumers on a recent saturday afternoon , he knew that he and the sink were most likely going to lose			1
shop therapy : organizing themselves online , @entity1 shoppers hunt for bargains in packs @entity4 , a sales manager for @entity16 , a @entity1 kitchenware manufacturer , hoped to sell the sink for 799 yuan ( about $ 120 ) , but the team would n't have it			1
" no , we do n't want it ! " they yelled back at him			2
" we 're all losing interest , " joined in the group 's negotiator			1
" we want the lowest price we can get ! " sensing his impending defeat , @entity4 tried a few more times , offering lower and lower prices until the group haggled him down to a final score of 600 yuan ( about $ 85 )			2
team members raised their hands and cheered			2
" dou yao mai ! ( all of us want it ! ) , " they chanted as they all got up to place orders for new kitchen sinks			2
welcome to @entity1 's hottest sport for shoppers : tuangou , or team buying			1
the game goes like this : individuals band together via online @entity47 ( bulletin board systems ) , chat rooms and other web forums around products they are interested in purchasing , from fast food to cars or furniture			2
once a team amasses enough members , their appointed captain approaches retailers to organize in - store haggling sessions			1
" the final price was beyond my expectations , " said @entity62 who recently bought a purple @entity63 after her team called " @entity65 " negotiated a 30,000 yuan ( $ 4,400 ) discount with a local dealer for each of its 40 members wanting to purchase the car			0
" we were very surprised			0
" since bartering teams started to emerge around five years ago , they have increasingly become a defining characteristic both of online and offline consumerism in @entity1 , reshaping the way retailers reach out to customers on the internet as well as how they interact with them in stores			1
a number of companies , like the electronics chain @entity86 , have started to deal directly with the groups , while dozens of professional tuangou web sites have also emerged			2
retailers say they often feel they have no choice but to join the bartering or lose business			2
some retailers wait months just for an invitation to take part in an event			2
" these events help connect us to consumers , " @entity4 told @entity2			0
" i know i ca n't make money here , but i am meeting a lot of potential clients			0
" @entity4 also says his company monitors @entity104 on a daily basis , studying the site 's forums for feedback about their products , sometimes even engaging directly with consumers			0
" this is crucial to our company 's success , " said @entity4			0
" we do n't want to be left behind by this trend			0
" the tuangou web sites negotiate prices on behalf of shoppers while guaranteeing quality products and customer service			0
they also offer companies valuable market research based upon the conversations consumers are having about products on their online forums			1
" we are one of the most influential web sites here in @entity1 , " said @entity128 , founder of @entity129 , a group purchase site that has over 500 employees working in 22 branches across the country along with around one million registered users			1
" all of the home furnishing retailers are setting their eyes on e-commerce , and we are the prominent web site here , so they want more and more of their business to be done through us			2
" part of @entity146 's rise in @entity1 stems from the still - developing shopping landscape across the country			1
quality products can often be hard to come by while pricing systems lack transparency			0
@entity1 consumers are more likely to be influenced by the opinions and experiences of friends rather than advertising			1
the @entity157 has also served as a valuable a tool for shoppers to compare prices to ensure the best deal			1
hunting in packs bargaining is much more than a team sport in @entity1 -- it 's also a way of life that has been ingrained in the psyche of @entity1 society for centuries			1
" it is deeply rooted in our culture , " said @entity171 , who bought a set of suitcases for 30 percent off the sticker price			0
" we have the impulse to bargain everywhere			0
" social networking has also been vital to the phenomenon 's success			1
according to 2008 figures from the @entity184 ( @entity184 ) , nearly 100 million @entity1 netizens regularly visit online bulletin boards to share opinions , ask for help or socialize with friends			1
" these internet based communities are the soul of @entity1 social media , " said @entity189 of @entity190 , a @entity0 - based research and consulting firm that tracks @entity1 bulletin boards and blogs for multinational companies			1
" the @entity1 @entity157 is more developed from a social perspective than in the @entity200			1
there are more people who are participating in these kinds of conversations , and they are more active			0
" you have that foundation where people are already communicating with each other and sharing information and eventually that impacts commerce			0
" several companies have tried to start group buying sites in @entity214 and @entity215 , yet most of them have failed due to a sheer lack of interest from consumers			1
" i had read about it in @entity1 and thought maybe it would work over here , but it did n't work out too well , " said @entity221 , founder of @entity223 - based @entity222 , which is now inactive			1
" i am not sure people 's attitudes over here are right for it			0
" however , with the exploding popularity of social networking and the backdrop of the financial downturn , some companies are starting to test whether @entity238 consumers are ready to team up and bargain like the @entity1			1
one work in progress is a @entity242 application called @entity243 , which allows buyers to build teams across friend networks for products they want to purchase			0
the company then recruits retailers to bid against each other to offer the groups the lowest price			1
" it is an uphill battle , i will be very frank , " said @entity253 , co-founder of @entity243 , which now has around 1,000 users			0
" changing consumer behavior is difficult , getting them to understand and trust this site is one thing			0
the other thing is getting vendors to understand what this means for their business as well , " said @entity253			0
@entity266 is also trying to harness the potential for commerce via social media with an initiative called @entity271			2
the concept , which the company started piloting in @entity275 in may , encourages customers to buy computers in groups in order to save money			2
" with social networking , the innovation is taking place right in front of us , " @entity281 , vice president and general manager of consumer sales and marketing for @entity285 and @entity286 , told @entity2			1
" it is going to be part of how people engage with companies , learn about products , shop for products and ultimately buy products			0
how exactly it evolves , we do n't know			0
what we do know is we do n't want to sit on the sidelines			0
we want to engage and start to figure out how this makes sense for us and for our customers			0
