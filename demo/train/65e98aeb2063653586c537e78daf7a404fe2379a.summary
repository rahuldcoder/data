@entity0 -- president @entity4 will defend his foreign policy wednesday in a commencement address at the @entity7 at @entity7 and lay out an interventionist , but not over-reaching plan , @entity3 officials say			1
the speech comes amid stinging criticism of the president 's foreign policy following a trip to @entity14 last month			1
@entity4 , who has carefully avoided mentioning any sort of military confrontation in his responses to the challenges in @entity19 and @entity20 , hit back at his critics , saying his goal is to avoid costly " errors " on the world stage			1
but the world waits for no man			0
@entity4 may advocate a risk - averse foreign policy , but he has a series of pressing global challenges which are likely to dominate the remainder of his term			1
here are a few : @entity33 the political crisis in @entity20 and president @entity36 's annexation of @entity37 have led to tensions between the @entity39 and @entity33 that are reminiscent of the @entity40			1
those tensions quickly have become the @entity4 administration 's central foreign policy crisis and have tested @entity0 's mettle and its alliance with @entity45			1
the @entity39 and its allies have accused @entity47 of backing militant separatists and fomenting ethnic skirmishes in eastern @entity20 , and while praising @entity20 's elections this weekend , have charged @entity33 with attempting to disrupt the vote			1
@entity33 has been kicked out of the @entity53 group of industrialized countries , and the @entity39 and the @entity55 have slapped a series of sanctions on @entity33 officials and entities			1
but a military response has been all but ruled out and there seems to be little if any taste on either side of the @entity64 for the kind of sectoral sanctions which would deter @entity36			0
the @entity39 says @entity33 is feeling the economic heat from the sanctions , but this month in @entity68 , @entity36 signed a deal with @entity71 president @entity70 to provide @entity71 with $ 400 billion worth of natural gas from @entity73 over the next 30 years			1
moreover , @entity33 has proven it can impose costs of its own			1
although @entity0 and @entity47 teamed up on a deal to rid @entity19 of its chemical weapons , @entity33 's political and military support for @entity19 president @entity77 and its pledge to provide weapons to governments across the @entity81 continue to frustrate the @entity39			1
with a veto - wielding permanent seat on the @entity85 , @entity33 is able to block action on world crises			1
the @entity39 needs to work with @entity33 on a nuclear deal with @entity89 and on curbing @entity91 's own nuclear ambitions			1
in today 's world , a new @entity40 simply seems impractical			0
@entity19 three years into @entity19 's bloody civil war , the opposition remains weak and fragmented , extremists continue to grow in numbers and influence and @entity77 remains firmly in power			1
a year - long effort to bring the opposition and the regime to the table for peace talks was a failure , and a political negotiation seems further away than ever while the humanitarian catastrophe continues to grow			0
despite the @entity39 - @entity33 agreement to remove @entity19 's chemical weapons , the regime is believed to have launched chlorine attacks which are now being investigated by @entity85 inspectors			1
the administration talks of needing to change @entity77 's " calculus , " but @entity4 has resisted pressure from many of his top advisers to involve the @entity39 deeper in the conflict			2
without a decisive change in the balance of power on the military field , it seems unlikely @entity77 will feel compelled to make a deal			0
@entity89 world powers are just under two months away from a july 20 deadline for a comprehensive deal with @entity89 on its nuclear program			2
an interim pact reached with @entity128 in november eased some economic sanctions in return for @entity89 rolling back parts of its nuclear program , which the @entity39 and others believe is designed to produce a weapon			2
@entity89 says its nuclear intentions are peaceful			2
@entity39 negotiators say progress has been made in several rounds of negotiations and the so - called @entity139 -- the @entity39 , @entity71 , @entity33 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 -- and @entity89 have begun to draft an agreement			1
but a number of significant roadblocks remain , including the future of @entity89 's heavy water reactor in @entity148 , its underground facility at @entity150 and whether @entity89 will maintain the right to enrich a small amount of low - grade uranium on its own soil for medical and research purposes			2
@entity89 has said those are all sticking points , but @entity158 and the @entity39 are n't likely to budge on them			2
a recent @entity85 report also warned that @entity89 continues to pursue ballistic missile capability and @entity128 appears unwilling to discuss its missile technology as part of the nuclear negotiations , to the great frustration of the @entity39 and its @entity45 allies			2
new concerns have also surfaced over reports that @entity33 and @entity89 are discussing an oil - for - goods deal , which could violate the terms of the interim agreement , circumvent sanctions and derail the fate of the talks			1
@entity176 threat the @entity39 got @entity177 and diminished the capacity of @entity180 's senior leadership in @entity181 , but a recent @entity183 report said the terror group 's affiliate organizations have gotten even deadlier			2
and a series of @entity180 - based threats to attack @entity39 and @entity189 targets in @entity45 is causing major concern inside the @entity39 intelligence community			0
the @entity183 report said the group 's affiliate in @entity195 -- @entity193 -- is among the most lethal of the network and " continues to pose the most significant threat to the @entity39 , " which shut down its embassy in @entity195 due to the threats			0
the civil war in @entity19 has created conditions allowing parts of the country to become a new haven for @entity180 - linked groups and thousands of foreign fighters -- a situation that @entity39 officials warn could come back to threaten the @entity39 homeland			1
next door in @entity211 , a weak security environment in the western section of the country , along with the destabilizing effects of the situation in @entity19 , have allowed a former @entity180 affiliate , the @entity217 , to move across the border with ease to conduct its own attacks			2
terrorist groups across @entity91 and @entity222 are posing an ever - greater threat -- from @entity224 and @entity225 , where @entity227 and other extremists groups are growing in strength -- to @entity230 , where militants from @entity232 , an @entity180 - linked group in @entity233 , are blamed for an increasing number of attacks			0
the recent kidnapping of hundreds of @entity238 schoolgirls by @entity239 has suddenly raised the profile of this @entity180 - linked group			0
while @entity180 's affiliates are grabbing the headlines , the body 's core group in @entity181 may be making a comeback			0
officials tell @entity1 's @entity248 the core is seeking to place operatives to attack @entity39 targets at home and abroad			0
@entity14 the more pressing crises in @entity20 and @entity19 have prevented the @entity4 administration from focusing on the long anticipated " pivot to @entity14 , " billed as an effort to cement @entity39 presence in the region and counter @entity71 's rise			1
however , the region is experiencing significant chaos , and managing @entity71 has proven a formidable challenge			0
tensions continue to escalate between @entity264 and @entity71 over a set of deserted islands in the @entity267			0
@entity268 is also stepping up its territorial claims in the @entity270 , and this week a @entity71 vessel rammed and sank a @entity273 fishing boat after a series of anti-chinese riots that left four @entity71 workers dead and more than 100 injured			0
the two closest @entity39 allies in the region -- @entity264 and @entity281 -- are feuding over what @entity282 perceives as inadequate remorse from its brutal colonization and the use of @entity91 " comfort women " during @entity288 in the region , @entity280 's military seized power in a bloodless coup			0
and @entity0 's ambitions at increasing trade in the region appear stalled			0
@entity4 traveled to @entity264 last month to forge a deal with @entity264 to move ahead with the 12 - nation free - trade @entity296 ( @entity296 ) but left @entity298 empty - handed			2
the turmoil is distracting from the region 's most dangerous threat -- unpredictable @entity91 leader @entity302 and his nuclear arsenal			0
@entity302 's erratic behavior and threats of a fourth nuclear test have prompted the @entity39 and @entity91 to shelve the scheduled transfer of wartime operational control of troops on the @entity310 from @entity0 to @entity282			0
and more ... plenty of other challenges remain : from managing relations with @entity314 after the near - certain election of former defense minister @entity316 -- whose interim government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses -- to salvaging the @entity81 peace process , after talks broke down last month			0
as @entity4 winds down the war in @entity323 , violence is surging in @entity211 , the first war he brought to a close -- a potent reminder the @entity39 withdrawal from @entity323 must be managed carefully			0
and as the president seeks to articulate a foreign policy that avoids aggressive military entanglements while countering critics calling for a more aggressive @entity39 foreign policy , it remains certain that his inbox will remain full .			1

@entity4 delivers the commencement address wednesday at @entity7

there are global challenges likely to dominate the remainder of his term
