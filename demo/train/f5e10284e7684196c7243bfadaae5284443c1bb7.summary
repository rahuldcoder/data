-- @entity1 is out of time			2
of course , in many ways , the strange @entity4 hamlet of @entity6 's " @entity5 " has been for ages			1
it 's an old , ghostly community removed from nearby @entity10 by murky woods and two - lane blacktop , a world away from more earthly concerns			0
( @entity6 , like @entity0 , is a unit of @entity16			1
) but now it 's really out of time			0
the seventh and final season of the vampire drama begins sunday night			1
" @entity5 " started with the conceit that vampires already lived among us , but they 'd kept their existence secret until a product called @entity26 -- an artificial plasma -- allowed them to " come out of the coffin			1
" waitress @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , a telepath , falls in love with vampire @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , and suddenly humans and vampires find out a lot more about each other			1
creator @entity39 was attracted to the material , based on @entity42 ' series of novels , because of the issues that could be explored through the different types of beings			0
" the books are so rich , and ( @entity50 ) opens so many doors , " he told @entity0 in 2008 , just prior to the show 's premiere			1
" if it 's just a story device with fangs , i 'm not that interested			1
" he turned over the production reins after the fifth season			1
@entity56 handled a chunk of season six and then was replaced by @entity59			1
over the years , the show grew incredibly complex			1
shape - shifters , werewolves and other supernatural visitors showed up in @entity1			0
the series branched out to peripheral characters who appeared and disappeared with little explanation			0
the community divided into factions pitting the undead against the humans -- and against one another			1
the sex was graphic ; so was the violence			0
now that the show 's conclusion beckons , here are a few items to watch for : 1			1
@entity80 told @entity81 that a lot of story branches have been sawed off			1
" the hope is ... that by putting all of our characters essentially into one story , now it 's @entity1 vs. the world , the characters people love will get more screen time because these stories do n't have separate demands , " he said			1
" we just get to tell a simpler story and then experience them through our characters			2
the future of @entity99 the virus that infected @entity26 -- and got into the vampires ' systems -- had no cure at the end of season six			1
will a solution be found , or will it devastate the community ? vampires want more blood -- or they 'll die			2
that ca n't be good for anybody			0
do n't mess with @entity113 -- or @entity114			0
@entity33 's transformation into @entity116 took off in the sixth season -- but where do you go after you partake of the vampire god 's blood ? in @entity33 's case , you lose much of your power			2
on the other hand , he could use a little more compassion			0
as for @entity114 ( @entity126 ) , the old vampire sheriff may not be completely dead , @entity80 said			0
" we 've obviously promised a ' where is @entity114 ? ' story and it would feel incredibly cheap to deliver the goods right away , " he told @entity81			2
" we sent @entity131 ( @entity132 ) off in search of him and if she were to find him right away , we would be doing a disservice to ourselves and to the audience			0
" but will he appear nude again ? @entity126 does n't mind			0
" he 's @entity138 , " @entity80 told @entity81			0
" there was no discussion whatsoever			0
@entity4 's now very ex-governor , @entity142 ( @entity143 ) , was no friend to the vampires			2
( in fact , you might say he lost his head over the situation			0
) but the anger he felt is shared by many fearful humans			2
there are many who would just as soon see the vampires return to the underground -- or be vanquished completely			2
bar owner @entity159 ( @entity160 ) may have given up his restaurant , but he 's now mayor of @entity1 -- and he 's making a play for @entity29 , too			0
author @entity50 paired the two in a book , and it did n't go over well with fans , but on tv the story could be different			2
either way , in real life @entity30 is still firmly paired up with @entity171 -- they 've been married for nearly four years			0
what " @entity5 " development are you looking forward to ?			1

" @entity5 " begins its seventh and final season sunday night
hit @entity6 show has dealt with *relationship* between humans , vampires and other creatures
final season should wrap up a number of story lines
