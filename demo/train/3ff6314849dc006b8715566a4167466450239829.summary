according to prosecutors , the campaign led to the genocide of more than 1,700 @entity39			2
during his first and only address to the three - judge panel , @entity0 said that the prosecution 's contention that the chain of command places him at fault for the atrocities is false			1

but a number of appeals and motions by the defense in several courts threatened to derail the process			0
at one point , a judge annulled the testimony in the trial			0
legal wrangling over the insertion and ejection of lawyers on the defense side and whether certain evidence was admissible resulted in sometimes contradicting rulings from various courts			0

the war did not end until 1996 , leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees			0
