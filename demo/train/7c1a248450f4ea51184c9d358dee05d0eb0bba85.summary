last week , in an unusually public display of campaign discord , a clash between @entity2 political operatives erupted in full view when @entity7 , a liberal activist and staunch @entity9 supporter , announced his resignation from the board of @entity12 , a @entity13 super pac			1
@entity7 was not going quietly			0
his resignation letter contained a bold claim -- that leaders at @entity12 were feeding newsgroups devastating stories about his fundraiser , undermining his ability to raise money			0
by @entity7 's account , his colleagues within @entity23 were orchestrating his demise			1
setting aside a debate on the accuracy of @entity7 's assertion , there 's an interesting psychological perspective to be raised about why campaign squabbles like this are already cropping up for the @entity9 campaign and why we can expect more of them			1
unlike her competitors on the @entity39 side , @entity9 is the clear frontrunner for @entity41			0
and while intuitively we might expect that fewer primary contenders would allow @entity9 to snatch up her party 's most talented consultants , enabling her to form a stronger , more disciplined campaign team , research suggests that too much talent in a group can actually undermine performance			1
we often assume that adding more talented players to a team will lead to better outcomes			1
but a close look at the data reveals a different story			0
last year , a research team led by @entity60 , professor of organizational behavior at @entity62 , released a paper looking at the relationship between the percentage of stars on an @entity68 team and the team 's win - loss record			1
a greater concentration of stars did predict more wins , but only up to a point			0
as it turned out , the teams with the most stars performed dramatically worse than those with considerably less talent			1
( think 2004 @entity79 , whose roster included likely hall - of - famers @entity82 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , being nearly swept in the finals by the @entity88 -- a team whose best - known player was @entity91			2
) and it 's not just basketball			2
when @entity60 and his colleagues turned their attention to @entity98 soccer teams , they found results that were eerily comparable			2
once again , too much talent predicted fewer wins			2
researchers at @entity103 discovered a similar pattern among @entity106 analysts			0
when star performers are grouped together , they produce reports that clients find less impressive than teams with a more diverse pool of analysts			2
all of which raises an obvious question : why are so many talent - heavy teams falling short ? the reason is simple			1
top performers are accustomed to status , and status is a limited resource			0
when stars are pooled together , they tend to compete with one another for status , and that competition is distracting			0
it gets in the way of effective teamwork			0
@entity2 's unparalleled political clout has cleared the field among @entity41 , giving her the opportunity to build a political all - star team			1
but paradoxically , having unrestricted access to top - notch operatives might be a significant weakness			0
there 's a tipping point for talent			1
and @entity138 may be on the wrong side of it			0
so what can you do when you have a talent - heavy team and need to ensure collaboration ? recent studies on the psychology of teamwork offer insights that can help any group collaborate more effectively			1
here are a few that may help the @entity9 's team establish a more cohesive unit			1
the first tip : establish a very clear hierarchy			0
@entity9 has resisted officially declaring her candidacy , which is sound strategy considering that she 's the favorite			2
however , given the high - powered makeup of her team , a lack of formal hierarchy early on can be problematic in the long term			1
when structure is wanting and power is up for grabs , competition and status conflicts arise more easily			0
a related insight : provide differentiated roles to team members , right at the start			2
we work better with others when our job is unique and does n't overlap with others ' responsibilities			0
too much similarity between jobs leads to competition , which can hinder collaboration			0
the @entity184 recently reported that some senior staff members are signing on without salary , start date or job descriptions			0
presidential campaigns are short and intense , and no one expects a formal @entity192 orientation process			2
yet bringing people on without specifying their roles neglects getting their buy - in and makes it more likely they 'll reach beyond their prescribed function later on			0
finally , when working with a talent - rich team , instead of simply rewarding individual performance , it 's wise to establish group goals that can only be achieved when teammates band together			1
group goals force people to view their success as a function of their team 's performance , which is critical			1
as @entity60 , lead author of the " too much talent effect " research puts it , when dealing with a team of all - stars , " the bottom line is you have to create a more cooperative mindset			1
" there 's little question that @entity9 's campaign team will be among the most experienced and talent - rich in the history of politics			1
and like any high - achieving group , its members stand to benefit from leveraging the science of top performance .			0

tensions have already *emerged* among @entity2 's potential presidential campaign team
