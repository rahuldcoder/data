@entity1 , @entity0 -- when it 's revealed that a prominent member of a clandestine movement has been giving information to the @entity8 for months , you 'd think it would intimidate others in the group into backing off			1
and that may have been the case when it was discovered that " @entity15 , " real name @entity15 , had been arrested in june and provided information that helped lead to the arrest of five other alleged members of the " hacktivist " collective , @entity20			1
for a few minutes , anyway			0
" that night , after everyone found out , it was a bit chilling , " said @entity21 , one of the few people associated with @entity20 who speaks publicly using his real identity			1
but in the hours and days that followed , something very different happened			0
a lot of people we had n't seen for months , or years , started showing up			0
an attack [ on some sites by @entity20 ] happened that night , " he said			1
" it just angered them , not frightened them			0
" @entity21 was speaking at @entity40 on tuesday , the annual festival in @entity1 devoted to @entity41 and digital culture			1
he appeared on a panel with the director of a documentary about @entity20 , and two people who spoke ( one via web chat ) wearing the movement 's trademark " @entity52 mask			1
" the masks , patterned after the one worn by the shadowy anti-hero from the comic book and movie " @entity62 , " gave an almost surreal air to the panel at a conference where black - framed glasses are a more common fashion accessory			1
as a crowd of about 200 watched , " @entity20 " spoke on a big screen , his mask and white gloves lending theatrics even as he talked soberly about the inner workings of a movement that has alternately inspired , intimidated and baffled the @entity41			1
" i was kind of mesmerized by what was going on , " said @entity71 , who directed " @entity72 : the @entity74			0
" " this is an attempt to define that culture			0
" in recent years , @entity20 has been involved in some of the most high - profile cyberattacks on the @entity41 -- hobbling the websites of governments and businesses , hacking into sites to reveal private data and , along the way , getting dubbed cyberterrorists by authorities in the @entity86 and elsewhere			1
who is @entity20 ? everyone and no one the group claims no leaders or power structure and does n't require any sort of membership			1
that , some members say , is a blessing and a curse			0
" that 's the double - edged sword of @entity20 , " said @entity20 9000			1
" anyone can claim the name of @entity20 and do whatever they want			1
if anyone wants to make @entity20 look bad ... it 's easy to do			1
" for example , he said he and many other " @entity105 " disagree with actions by @entity15 and others under the banner of @entity110 - group @entity109			1
those included posting private data , including credit - card and @entity115 numbers , of web users and launching distributed denial - of - service ( @entity118 ) attacks against media sites who posted stories they did n't like			0
@entity109 targets @entity125 law enforcement " when i got into this , i felt @entity20 was a group of groups who fight for the users , " @entity20 said			2
" to see people getting @entity132			0
. there 's a pretty good argument that 's a form of censorship			0
" last week , five men in the @entity86 and @entity137 were arrested and charged in federal court for what investigators called among the " most sophisticated hackers in the world			0
" @entity15 and others have claimed responsibility for cyberstrikes between december 2010 and june 2011 that included denial of service attacks against the websites of @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			2
@entity21 , who said " @entity15 " had always been " vocal , " " angry " and " a complete ass , " said he suspected something was amiss when the alleged @entity109 member disappeared from the web for a while , then returned more animated and aggressive than ever			1
" i watched , and some of these people who did these hacks would not have gotten arrested [ except for the fact that ] he taught them how to do the hacks , " he said			0
@entity71 's film chronicles the rise of @entity20 from a disparate group hanging out in the forums of notorious website 4chan to the day recently when members of the @entity169 parliament , in protest of a vote they said would restrict web freedom , donned their own @entity52 masks in solidarity with the group			2
@entity21 was , in his words , " around near the beginning , " which means about 2006			2
shortly after that , in 2008 , @entity20 gained visibility after launching an operation to defy the @entity182			2
after leading protests and other efforts against the church , which @entity20 attacked after it deleted leaked copies of a video that actor @entity190 made for it , @entity184 's identity was revealed			1
he then shifted his activism to acting as a sort of public spokesman for the movement			0
while the collective has no single unifying goal , those associated with @entity197 often work against what they consider censorship , hypocrisy and heavy - handedness by governments around the world			2
anonymous members say they were active in @entity209 uprisings in places such as @entity211 and @entity212 , have outed members of alleged child pornography sites and vocally opposed the @entity215 -- federal legislation web activists felt could hamper freedom online			2
they 've also backed the occupy political movement , which is how the other masked panelist said he got involved about four months ago			0
an activist with @entity222 , he said the collective , in effect , became tech support for efforts here			2
he recalled a protest during which he says a police officer was acting aggressively toward protestors at a demonstration at @entity231 last month			0
as cameras streamed the protest online , he called out the officer 's name and badge number , saying that all of his personal information would be online within hours			0
" and they were , " the masked panelist in @entity1 said			0
" i was able to call on @entity20 and know they would deliver			2
" so what will become of @entity20 in the wake of the recent arrests ? @entity21 said most people he talks to seem to realize arrest is a possibility			1
" i do n't think anything is going to change , " he said .			0
