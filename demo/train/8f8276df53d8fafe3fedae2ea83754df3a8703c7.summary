police warned the 8 - year - old they were going to tase her			1
" within seconds , " an officer fired darts from the electroshock weapon into the chest of the 70 - pound girl , according to a lawsuit filed by the girl 's mother			1
" the force of the electricity shot through her body , lifted her , and threw her against a wall			0
after the officers had stunned ( the girl ) into high voltage submission , they pulled the fish - hook like @entity21 darts from her chest , gave her emergency medical attention , bandaged the holes left by the razor - sharp hooks , and called the ambulance			1
" the reason the police were at the home was to keep the girl from hurting herself ; the babysitter had called them because the child had a knife in her hand			1
all parties agree on this point -- the girl 's mother , @entity40 , as well as the defendants : the city of @entity43 , @entity44 , its former police chief , @entity46 , and the four officers at the scene on october 4 , 2013			1
but their opinions about the responding officers ' actions diverge from there			1
the girl 's mother says the police used " excessive force " when they used a taser on her girl			1
but @entity46 disagreed , telling @entity60 affiliate ksfy after the incident that the police " might possibly have saved this girl 's life			1
" because of the pending litigation , @entity43 mayor @entity64 refused comment on saturday			1
and attorney @entity67 , who is representing the defendants , said he was " not going to comment on the merits of pending litigation			0
" after an independent two - month investigation , the @entity71 ruled in december that the officer had acted appropriately			2
" given the circumstances facing the officer at the time , it appears from the report that deploying a @entity21 was the best viable way to defuse the situation , " @entity74 , the @entity75 state 's attorney , said in a statement			2
" that 's bull * * * * , " @entity40 's attorney @entity85 told @entity60 on saturday			2
" four trained police officers surrounding a 70 - pound , 8 - year - old @entity89 girl , " should have used less risky tactics , @entity85 said			1
" one distracts her , another grabs the girl 's arm			1
that 's what they should have done , " @entity85 said			2
" she had a kitchen paring knife , but had n't cut			0
she was a kid throwing a tantrum			0
they should have made an attempt to grab the kid , not use a weapon to throw her into a wall			0
a taser 's not meant to kill , but it does kill			2
many people have died after being hit by a taser by cops			0
it never should be used on a little child			0
she certainly was n't presenting a danger to officers			2
" " i do n't fault for the police being there because they were called			2
but what happened while they were there is why i 'm upset , " the girl 's father , @entity117 , told ksfy soon after the incident			1
one of the officers was a @entity21 instructor , while another was a hostage negotiator , @entity119 reported			2
@entity46 told ksfy last october that @entity43 police had used @entity21 nine times in the past two years , with the girl , who is identified in the lawsuit only as " @entity131 , " the youngest recipient of the electric shock			1
" i do n't think 8 - year - olds should be tased anywhere in the world , " @entity117 said			1
@entity117 and @entity40 are not married , and the father is not a party to the lawsuit , @entity85 said			0
the plaintiffs are seeking at least $ 100,000 in damages , plus punitive damages and " other relief as the court shall consider to be fair and equitable			1
" " her pain and suffering is going to be of that type that a jury will have to tell us what it 's worth , " said @entity85 's co-counsel @entity144			0
" part of that is going to be a reflection of the fact that you 're not supposed to use a taser on a kid			0
i do n't know of too many cops that do n't know that			0
" @entity67 , the defendants ' attorney , said he did n't know if the case would go to trial , but @entity144 said he hopes it does			0
" @entity168 " is getting mental and emotional counseling from a child counselor , @entity85 said			0
" what is it really going to honestly do for the rest of her life as she has to interact with authority figures and law enforcement ? " @entity144 said			0
" what 's it going to be like first time she looks in the rear view mirror and law enforcement gives her a speeding ticket ? she wo n't shake that			0
" since the incident , @entity40 and her daughter , who are members of the @entity186 , have moved from @entity43 back to the tribal reservation , @entity85 said			1
' we called for help , and they killed my son , ' @entity190 man says			0
