@entity3 took the case to the @entity19 , who suspended the ban until a hearing could be heard , making it possible for manager @entity23 to make signings in the january transfer window			1

" in an act of good faith and with a view to the possibility of future collaboration with @entity5 , and without recognizing any liability , @entity3 has agreed to pay compensation costs for the training given to the player while at @entity5 , as mandated by @entity14 in its original ruling			1
" meanwhile , @entity2 crisis club @entity86 have had a fourth change of ownership in six months , and there is likely to be another before the end of this season			1
@entity95 - based businessman @entity94 , who was born in @entity96 but has a @entity98 passport , has taken over @entity100 's 90 percent stake after activating a clause in their $ 27 million loan agreement			0
the @entity98 @entity104 reported that the @entity106 's lawyer is contesting that action , but @entity94 is seeking to stabilize the debt - ridden club 's finances before selling his shares			0
he will try to delay the winding - up hearing scheduled for next wednesday over $ 11.8 million in unpaid taxes			0
