-- one question that policymakers might have overlooked in trying to come up with a long - term strategy toward @entity4 is this : could the @entity5 be the next @entity6 ? @entity6 , widely known by its former name of @entity6 , was once a pariah , but it has surprised almost everyone by becoming a @entity12 investor 's dream			1
while there are significant differences between @entity6 and @entity4 , there are similarities that prompt the same @entity18 investors who correctly predicted @entity6 's turnaround to be optimistic about @entity4 's future			1
until recently , @entity6 's only ally was @entity22			1
for over a decade , the international community placed sanctions on @entity6 for its human rights violations , including the house arrest of the prominent activist @entity27			2
but the junta drastically changed direction and endorsed a @entity31 road map for reform -- a process that led to the @entity31 lifting its export ban in september			0
today , an emancipated @entity27 is working with the new government on reforms , and westerners carrying suitcases of cash ( sometimes literally ) are looking to invest in the country			0
there are many good reasons to turn to @entity6			2
the country has plenty of fertile land for agriculture , an abundance of precious stones and large reserves of oil , gas , coal and metals			0
office rentals in some parts of @entity56 , the former capital , exceed those in central @entity58			0
children who used to beg on the streets have been spotted selling copies of the investment law ( in @entity6 and @entity63 )			2
@entity6 's transformation is partly because of the leadership realizing that overreliance on @entity22 jeopardized the country 's national security			1
the government prioritized diversifying its trading counterparts , and the detente began			0
an over-dependence on @entity22 could become a big issue for @entity4 , too			1
@entity22 props up @entity4 with aid and diplomatic support			1
according to the @entity77 , the @entity76 provides @entity4 most of its energy needs and consumer goods and nearly half of its food supplies			2
but despite the support , the @entity4 leadership often ignores @entity86 's requests			1
@entity4 conducted its third nuclear test in february despite @entity22 publicly asking it not to so			1
economic and political pressures do not work well on @entity4 's leadership because its central ideology of @entity91 , translated as " self - reliance , " produces a very negative reaction to outside pressure			1
this stems from an underdog psyche resulting from centuries of kowtowing to strong @entity22 and @entity99 neighbors			2
when the regime feels provoked , it often acts in the opposite direction to demonstrate its independence			0
for @entity22 , being ignored by @entity4 is an embarrassment			1
@entity22 's strategy is a combination of reprimand with ongoing economic engagement , hoping that its influence will change @entity4 's mind			1
meanwhile , @entity4 's leadership is aware of its ever - increasing reliance on @entity22 , and the @entity91 ideology may catalyze diversification -- as in @entity6			1
and like @entity6 , @entity4 would have an appeal to investors			1
it , too , has large deposits of undeveloped mineral wealth , estimated by the @entity119 government to be worth $ 6 trillion			0
the country also boasts a cheap labor force , with even higher literacy rates than @entity6			2
there is one big difference between the two countries -- the attitude of the people toward the @entity128			0
even when the @entity31 had sanctions on @entity6 , the people were n't taught to hate @entity31			2
a steady stream of propaganda , however , has left @entity4 with a negative view of the @entity31			2
but the recent celebrated visits of @entity31 such as @entity135 chairman @entity134 and former @entity137 star @entity136 show the appeal the @entity31 still has -- and the soft power it can leverage			0
while the @entity141 criticized @entity134 , saying the timing was n't " particularly helpful , " the timing was in fact telling			0
even while going head - to - head with the @entity31 on the world stage , a representative of @entity31 capitalism was heralded inside @entity4			0
of course , soft power strategies are difficult to employ while tensions are high			0
since the nuclear test in february , @entity4 has threatened to strike at @entity31 bases in @entity18			0
it has closed the joint @entity152 and declared a state of war with @entity119			0
these are actions that can not be ignored			0
but in deciding a response , it 's important to understand how the leadership is thinking -- and what the future could hold			0
in the meantime , it 's the @entity22 - @entity4 relationship that the savviest of @entity18 investors are watching most closely			1
maybe @entity4 could learn valuable lessons from @entity6			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 and @entity169 .			1

@entity168 and @entity169 : could the @entity5 be the next @entity6 ?
@entity168 , @entity169 : @entity6 surprised everyone by its reforms , and @entity12 investors responded
they say @entity4 leadership may not want to rely solely on @entity22 for its needs
@entity168 , @entity169 : visits to @entity4 or *interactions* with its people should be *encouraged*
