@entity0 -- from @entity3 to @entity0 , the outrage is spreading over @entity5 ' decision to cancel a movie release following a cyber attack and threats from a group of @entity11 - backed hackers			1
politicians urged @entity5 not to back down in the face of threats tied to the release of the controversial comedy " @entity17 , " and then began lashing out when the studio made it clear it has no further plans to release the film , which depicts an assassination plot against @entity11 leader @entity23			2
@entity25 rep. @entity24 , chairman of the @entity26 , slammed @entity5 's decision thursday as a " capitulation " to the @entity11 dictator and called for the @entity30 to rally the international community and severely sanction @entity11 for carrying out what he called a " cyber war			1
" @entity36 investigators tracked the hackers who broke into @entity5 's servers , published private information and threatened moviegoers back to the @entity11 regime , @entity30 law enforcement officials told @entity1 on wednesday			1
the @entity11 regime slammed the movie this summer as " terrorism and a war action			0
" and despite the hackers ' threat to attack movie theaters , the @entity46 has said " there is no credible intelligence " supporting an active plot against movie theaters			0
and president @entity54 urged people to " go to the movies			0
" " once you capitulate to one dictator , does that mean that the next dictator or the next terrorist that says you 're not going to make a comedy about -- or a film at all about @entity65 , " @entity24 said			0
" all of us in public life have a responsibility right now to speak out and to say , ' no , @entity5 , you did the wrong thing ' and to say to @entity3 , come behind -- the other studios should come behind @entity5 and offer their support			0
" @entity24 said the @entity30 should get international support to sanction @entity11 and cut off its access to financial institutions			2
watch out world : @entity11 deep into cyber warfare , defector says more broadly , @entity24 said @entity5 's decision to " self - censor " undercuts @entity30 efforts to promote freedom throughout the world , including in the hermit kingdom			1
" that 's what 's most worrisome about this decision , " @entity24 said			2
former @entity25 presidential nominee @entity87 also urged @entity5 , " do n't cave , fight " in a tweet on wednesday			1
sen. @entity91 , the incoming chair of the @entity92 , called @entity5 's decision " profoundly troubling " in a statement			1
" that decision sets a troubling precedent that will only empower and embolden bad actors to use cyber as an offensive weapon even more aggressively in the future , " @entity91 said in a statement thursday			1
but @entity91 , the 2008 @entity25 presidential nominee , pinned the @entity5 debacle on the @entity54 administration for failing to " satisfactorily address " cyber warfare			2
@entity91 pointed to @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 attacks on government and private financial sectors and said the @entity54 administration has failed to " deter our adversaries			0
" but @entity112 has also failed to tackle cybersecurity , failing to pass legislation before the end of the 113th @entity112 that would have beefed up public - private sector partnerships to fend off cyber attacks , which are on the rise			0
and @entity112 needs to tackle that type of comprehensive legislation , @entity91 said in the statement			0
rep. @entity122 , a @entity25 and @entity123 veteran , did n't pull any punches as he linked the @entity5 decision to recent events			2
and rep. @entity127 , a top - ranking @entity128 , called on @entity5 to release " @entity130 " on dvd and tweeted " we should not let a pathological regime in @entity11 intimidate us			1
" he added that he would be the first online to see the movie			0

rep. @entity24 called the decision a " capitulation " and called for sanctions to punish @entity11 for a " cyber war "
@entity87 also tweeted , urging @entity5 " do n't cave , fight "
sen. @entity91 said @entity5 's decision sets a " troubling precedent , " but *ultimately* *blamed* @entity54
