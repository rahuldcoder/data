@entity0 , a young barber at @entity1 in central @entity2 , hovers over a customer 's half - trimmed head , clippers in hand , talking about the good old days of 2008			1
" yeah , i was all for @entity7			1
he was the man ! " proclaimed @entity0 , 32 , whose friends call him " mr. @entity12 " and whose colleagues sometimes refer to him as " mr. @entity11			0
" as he brushed the hair clippings off his apron , he goes on : " i even got to meet him , once			0
" or so he thought			0
@entity0 , like many of his fellow @entity21 , feels let down			1
the promise , the hope , the dream of the first black president has stalled in the reality of a stubborn economy , two wars and a @entity29 engaged in full - contact politics			1
so this time around , come @entity31 2012 , a frustrated @entity0 says he might not vote at all			2
he 's done with all of it			2
" after all this , i just do n't trust the government anymore			0
they 're just playin ' with people			0
what have they really done ? nothing , as far as i can see			0
i 'm not going to vote at all this year			1
my wife , either , i 've convinced her not to vote , " lamented @entity0 as he edged the hairline of his customer			2
" i 'm just disappointed			2
it 's not even @entity7			1
it 's all of them			2
i 've come to realize they 're all the same			0
it does n't matter if you 're a @entity50 , it does n't matter if you 're @entity51 , tea party , independent , whatever , it does n't mater			1
they are all the same			0
" the feeling , though certainly not universal , is more and more echoed by frustrated and disengaged @entity21 at gas stations and gyms , diners and coffee houses throughout @entity60			1
disappointment and loyalty while president @entity7 's approval rating has rebounded recently , jumping back up 5 percentage points to 49 % in the latest @entity67 / @entity66 poll , the approval ratings for @entity29 are at all - time lows			1
in the same poll , only 16 % say they approve of the job @entity29 is doing , with 83 % giving lawmakers from both parties the thumbs down			0
across @entity60 , the state where then - @entity75 sen. @entity7 surprised the nation and swept the 2008 @entity21 caucuses , igniting early momentum and propelling him to win his party 's nomination over @entity75 sen. @entity81 , other @entity21 are standing tall with the president , ready to fight to give him another term			1
" he does n't care about all that mess			2
they just have n't let him do his job			0
i have never seen so many politicians fighting so hard to take one man down			0
but he 's fighting for all of us , " said @entity91 , co-owner of the barber shop that caters to judges , local politicians , police officers and downtown professionals			2
" i think if they give him another shot , then he 'll have enough time to change some things around			0
" " he 's our first black president			1
and he 's been amazing			2
have you really looked at all that he has gotten done , despite those fools ? and , on top of that , he 's got swag ! " meanwhile , the @entity7 campaign is upbeat , quietly marshaling hundreds of volunteers from @entity109 to @entity110 , @entity111 to @entity112 , to stoke the fires for the incumbent president at a time when all the attention is on the @entity50 contest			1
according to two senior @entity7 campaign aides , the president 's 2012 re-election efforts began in @entity60 as early as april			1
since then , they say they 've : hired 20 paid staffers			0
held more than 1,280 training and planning sessions , house parties and phone banks			0
made more than 350,000 calls to supporters			0
held more than 4,400 one - on - one meetings			0
covering all 99 counties of @entity60 they are tasking volunteers to avoid relying solely on blanket phone calls right now , and instead create sit - down face - to - face meetings with people to build relationships and gather information : what is happening in their community , what people are hearing , who they are , what they care about , how they can be leaders for the campaign in their community			1
they argue that no presidential field campaign has ever done this on a big scale			0
" we 're in 1,774 precincts , in all 99 @entity60 counties , " said @entity151 , chairwoman of the @entity152			1
she added that even though @entity7 will be unopposed this year , her party still plans on caucusing tuesday night			1
and the president , she said , will even make an appearance , " by the magic of the @entity160			2
" when they 're not beating up on each other , @entity50 presidential candidates have spent much of the past few months beating up on @entity7			1
" we 've seen the median income for @entity75 drop by 10 % , " said presumed @entity50 front - runner and former @entity165 gov. @entity164 , blaming the economy 's woes on @entity7			1
" by the end of his first term -- his only term -- he 's on track to amass almost as much public debt as all the prior presidents combined			2
this has been a failed presidency			0
" they have hit him on the economy , they 've hit him on foreign policy , health care and the size of government			1
some even continue to suggest , albeit jokingly , that he is not a legitimate @entity75 citizen , as hinted in an offhand comment by @entity164 's son @entity188 last week			1
the younger @entity164 quickly walked back his comments in a tweet after being confronted by the media			0
" i remember , after he got inaugurated ... and he said , ' look , if i ca n't get this economy turned around in three years , i 'll be looking at a one - term proposition , ' " reminded @entity164 during a stump speech monday in @entity193 , @entity60			1
" well , i 'm here to collect			2
" but through the attacks , the president has largely remained quiet			2
only occasionally has he wandered into the fray , suggesting that he may engage the other side when the dust settles			0
" i 'm going to wait until everybody is voted off the island , " he told @entity202 on " @entity203			2
" @entity60 has historically been the proving grounds for underdog candidates			1
in 2008 it was @entity7			1
this year , it could be former @entity75 sen. @entity210 , who has been surging since the recent @entity67 / @entity212 / @entity66 poll put him in a strong third place behind @entity164 and @entity75 rep. @entity214 , but moving up			2
for @entity7 , his @entity60 test comes in november nevertheless , @entity7 's task in @entity60 , considered a pivotal swing state when the general election comes in november , is still grand			1
he must retain the @entity21 support he had in 2008 -- when he camped out in the state for months before the caucuses and visited @entity60 more than three dozen times -- while convincing the third of the voters who call themselves independent not to drift back over to the @entity50 side , and the other third who are @entity21 not to stay home			1
and all this goes on while @entity50 continue to grab the spotlight and hammer him throughout 2012			1
meanwhile , the base is restless			0
" it seems very hopeless ... hope , change ... but nothing changes , " said @entity0 , the young barber who is fed up with @entity7 and the process			2
when asked what she 'd say to @entity0 , the @entity60 @entity21 chair 's words got pointed			1
" yes , there is frustration , there is angst			0
but i would say to that person -- and i 'd say it directly to his face -- that there has been a remarkable record of achievement in the past four years , " @entity151 said , her passion growing			0
" i 'd point to the record of achievement , in the face of two things happening simultaneously : the near - collapse of the entire economy , an economy that was bleeding 750,000 jobs			0
and now he has presided over 23 consecutive months of private sector job growth			0
i 'd point to everything he did to pass the @entity263			0
i 'd point to what he did to partner with the @entity268 automakers to save the @entity75 automotive industry , or bringing combat troops from @entity272 home with their families at @entity274 , instead of on their fifth or sixth deployment			0
" " and he did this in the face of massive opposition from a party who saw as its role to take down a sitting president , not to compromise , not to work with him , but to take him down , " @entity151 said			0
" this is a group of people , not all of them , who say ' no , heck no , never ! ' " " the real story for the @entity50 is going to be not on the night of january 3 , but on the morning of january 4 , " she said confidently			1
" he 'll be on the way back to the @entity290 , and they 'll be left sweeping up the floor of the empty rooms , and not much else			0

@entity7 won @entity60 's caucuses in 2008 ; now he 's seeing some frustration from his base
says one *dismayed* citizen : " i 'm not going to vote at all this year . "
@entity60 @entity21 are mounting an *aggressive* effort to *energize* voters for tuesday night
@entity50 candidates continue to *pummel* the president on the economy , health care
