often , artists create work with a view to immortality ; if they ca n't live on , perhaps their creations can			2
@entity6 , on the other hand , knows one of her seminal pieces has a death sentence			2
in 1997 , she joined with industrial designer @entity10 and architect @entity11 to create a breathtaking spiral made up of alternating conical dips and protrusions in the @entity15 , near the @entity17 town of @entity18 just off the @entity19			1
the project , known as @entity21 , spreads over one million square feet of sand			2
while the installation is still visible from the sky , there are marked signs of weathering			1
a body of water that once acted as the work 's center point has since evaporated			2
the earthen mounds have flattened over time , and cracks can be seen on the overall surface of the piece			2
for the artists ( known collectively as @entity38 ) , @entity21 's impending demise is the whole point			1
" through its slow disintegration , it 's become an instrument to measure the passage of time , " says @entity6			2
and as time has gone on , she adds , she finds she enjoys the piece more and more			0
" the more time passes , the more it becomes fragile , but it also has developed a more organic relationship with the site			0
when it was just made , you could feel the connection to the shape , but now , it looks like it was n't made by human beings at all , and this is something we like a lot			1
" in fact , to many users of @entity60 , the site does n't look man made			1
before knowing what it was , several commenters speculated it was anything from the imprint of an alien spaceship to the gateway to a parallel universe			0
a recent discussion on the @entity60 forum led to the work 's rediscovery , almost 17 years to the day after it was first built			1
" it 's surprising that so many years later it would get all this attention , but on the other hand , sometimes things find their own moment , " @entity6 speculates			1
" perhaps people can appreciate this kind of thing more now than they could back then , when they were caught up in making money or being famous			0
today , we 're in a financial crisis , and perhaps @entity21 reflects a new humility people feel , or a new need to connect to nature			0
@entity38 spent nine months constructing the work , with the help of a local construction crew who donated the tools and manpower to build the site			1
" i was totally cut off from @entity100 civilization -- though i found that a positive thing			0
it was a huge change in the life i had led up until then			0
i woke up at four every morning and worked on the site through to sunset			0
there were n't mobile phones back then , so i could n't even speak to my family in @entity109 , " she recalls			0
there were times when it seemed the shelf life for the installation would be cut short			1
in the early stages of construction , the town of @entity18 experienced the worst floods it had seen in 60 years			1
five years after it was completed , the government decided to build a new road that cut through the site			1
" we had to go back and negotiate with the governor , who nicely agreed to take the road back a few meters			0
for me , it just showed that the biggest danger is people			0
i think people are more likely to destroy it than nature itself			0

@entity60 users *delved* into a range of theories to *explain* giant spiral in @entity17
the shape is actually a 17 - year old art installation by @entity38 . @entity38
the artwork is already showing signs of *deterioration* , and may not last another 50 years
