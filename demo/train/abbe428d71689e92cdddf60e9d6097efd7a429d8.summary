you may have heard of the @entity2 -- the idea that eventually all physical objects could communicate data over the internet to other connected devices			1
already many devices in cities -- from automobiles to thermostats -- communicate information to operators , manufacturers and consumers via the internet about their status			1
but in rural @entity21 , a region not noted for its connectivity , researchers have begun a study into the internet of @entity24 , attaching wireless devices to livestock to gather information			1
" most of the work on the @entity2 has taken place in cities , " computer scientist professor @entity28 of @entity29 told @entity1			1
" but i think we 're quite unique in taking the concept out into a more rural environment			2
" this gives it a very different flavor			0
" while it has been widely reported that flocks of sheep in the project could transmit @entity44 and improve internet coverage in rural areas , professor @entity28 said this is not the aim of the research			1
so far , the study is all about gleaning data from the flock , not transmitting @entity44 signals from the animals			1
he doubts whether sheep could ever become roving wireless internet transmitters			1
" i would worry about sheep flocking behavior -- i do n't think sheep are the right animals to do this			1
" other researchers in north @entity63 have looked at reindeer			2
perhaps reindeer are more individualistic in their behavior but i 'm not an expert on animal behavior , " he said			0
for animals to be effective @entity44 nodes , he said , they need to be social but spread out at the same time ; a tough ask of nature			0
he said the beauty of sheep was that they flock together -- easily transmitting data until the flock come close to an internet receiving station which would take up the data and transmit it to researchers at @entity29			1
" the signal goes from sheep to sheep to sheep - it 's a bit like gossip , if you like			2
" sheep jokes apart , the aim of the study is serious			1
" we are looking deliberately at breadth , because there may be surprises ; the natural environment is all about dependencies and things that can affect other things , " @entity28 said			0
" the internet of @entity24 is about capturing sheep movements which could tell us a lot			1
" everything from flooding to drought to agricultural pollution could be monitored with a series of riverside and sheep - bound sensors			2
" there 's quite a big risk with the natural environment and sheep -- there are defecation and water quality issues			1
" if the pathogens coming through sheep wash into rivers and then into estuaries and water supplies -- that can be very dangerous			2
" the study has been backed by a Â£ 171,495 ( $ 265,000 ) prize from the @entity128 's @entity127 to look at ways of bringing the @entity2 to the countryside			1
the project is currently centered in @entity132 , @entity133 , where sheep farmer @entity134 -- star of the @entity136 series @entity137 -- is cooperating with the project			2
" under @entity142 regulations we already have to electronically chip sheep so the technology is already there in one respect , " he told the @entity136			0
" we have 3,500 sheep so whether a digital collar for all of them would be feasible is another matter but if someone said to me 10 years ago i would be tweeting to 7,000 followers from the top of a mountain or putting videos onto @entity156 , i would never have believed you			0
" we are on a journey over the next 10 to 15 years and the contribution technology can make to agriculture is immense			0
" @entity28 , meanwhile , said the project 's first hurdle would be finding a way to adequately tag the sheep with internet sensors			2
the whole unit , he said , was likely to be no larger than a packet of cigarettes			0
" we have looked at collars			0
i do n't know if you know sheep , but they get up to mischief and there 's a danger that a collar could endanger the sheep			0
" the sensors might be too big for ear tags and sheep do lose ear tags			0
maybe we could use a belt around their middle			0
" we 're looking for something that wo n't harm the sheep			0
" while the study is limited to sheep flocks for the time being , @entity28 said there 's no reason why it may not be extended to other livestock animals			1
" we might look at cows in the future , " he said			0
