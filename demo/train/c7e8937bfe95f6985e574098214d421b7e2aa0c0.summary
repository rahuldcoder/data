-- a @entity3 swat team backed by local police arrested four people overnight on suspicion of plotting terror attacks , the @entity1 told @entity0 sunday			1
the four were held in the city of @entity9 for " probable cause " of preparing the attacks , the highest level of suspicion in @entity3 , said @entity13 , a spokeswoman for the security force			1
she refused to say whether the suspects had been under surveillance or if the arrests resulted from a tip - off , saying she could not discussed details on an ongoing investigation			0
" through these arrests we have been able to prevent a situation from occurring , " @entity21 , head analyst at the @entity1 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity22			1
@entity3 is not raising its terror threat level -- which is currently at 3 , with 5 as the highest -- and there is " no reason for the public to be alarmed , " she said			2
" these arrests have not changed this threat level , " @entity13 added			0
an art gallery in central @entity9 was evacuated shortly before midnight local time , police said , but declined to say whether it was connected to the arrests			1
a party was going on at the @entity38 gallery at the time , with about 500 people attending the inauguration of an arts festival , according an interview with a witness in @entity44 , a local newspaper			2
the police cordon was removed at 6 a.m. local time , said @entity46 , a spokesman for @entity9 police			1
police have a " number of extra police officers " on the streets of @entity9 , @entity46 said			1
the prosecutor in charge of the case , @entity55 , said in a statement on the prosecution authority 's website that the investigation is still at an early stage and authorities can not reveal any details about the arrests			2
the head of the @entity1 , @entity65 , warned last week that " @entity67 terrorism is still the biggest threat against @entity3			2
" " but it is different today , " he said , calling it " more complex and unpredictable , both in terms of who could be a target and how they can strike			0
" @entity73 is now encouraging @entity67 radicals to stay home " and strike where they are , " rather than traveling to conflict zones to get experience , said @entity21 of the @entity1			0
" when individuals with those kind of ideologies act on their own it becomes harder to make a threat assessment , " she warned			0
@entity85 was hit by a suicide bombing in december			1
the attack on the capital , @entity3 's first suicide bombing , wounded two people in a district full of @entity93 shoppers			1
and police arrested two people in @entity9 , the country 's second - largest city , on suspicion of plotting a bombing in october			1
they were later released without charge , police said			0
after the @entity85 bombing , @entity1 said the country had almost 200 @entity67 extremists who advocate violence , but said there was no indication their number is growing			2
the police study was commissioned months before the attack in @entity85			1
the extremist threat is n't widespread , according to the report , which the government commissioned in february 2010			0
" the threat from violence - promoting @entity67 extremism in @entity3 is currently not a threat to the fundamental structures of society , @entity3 's democratic system or central government , " the summary said			1
but the radicals are capable of damage , police said			0
" while violence - promoting @entity128 extremist groups do not pose a threat to @entity3 society , they are still a threat to individuals and groups , especially in other countries , " the report said			2
the police analysis highlighted the disturbing trend of increasing foreign travel by the radicals			0
" the most serious potential threat to @entity3 is the long - term effects of people from @entity3 choosing to travel abroad to join violence - promoting @entity67 extremist groups , " the police said			1
" there are currently no signs of falling interest in joining foreign groups			0
" @entity3 authorities are investigating involvement in radicalism by @entity151 , the weekend 's suicide bomber			1
his emails before the bombings said that one reason for the attack was @entity3 's tolerance of @entity160 ' newspaper cartoon of the prophet @entity161 as a dog , authorities said			1
@entity163 , 28 -- who had lived in @entity164 , @entity3 and the @entity166 town of @entity167 -- also cited the presence of @entity3 troops in @entity170			2
that cartoon of @entity161 , published in 2007 , was also cited in the new report as an example " of local events that may fuel radicalism globally			0
" @entity3 's radical networks are typically made up of males between 15 and 30 years of age , with varying backgrounds , most of whom were born or grew up in @entity3 , the report said			1
several women are also involved , sharing the violence - promoting ideology , but they do n't engage directly in security - threatening activities , the police said			0
at least 80 % of the radicals are socially connected , mainly through friendships and the @entity189 , but the social ties do n't make them " one coherent network capable of fully coordinating its resources and working towards the same goal , " the report said			0
@entity3 terrorism expert @entity195 said that before the december bombing , @entity3 thought it was " immune " to terror attacks			2
" even ( @entity198 ) @entity198 said in early 2003 , 2004 , that if every country was like @entity3 , there would be no terrorism , " @entity195 said			0
police called upon civic leaders as well as the @entity3 @entity67 community to prevent and counter extremism , and they encouraged the public to develop a deeper knowledge of @entity67			1
though they should n't feel a greater responsibility to do so , practicing @entity67 and their clerics could be helpful in countering " violence - promoting propagandists active in @entity3 and abroad , " the report said			0
@entity0 's @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
