-- how much of a role do humans play in climate change ? a new report scheduled to come out on friday will give scientists ' latest take on the topic			1
the @entity9 report is expected to contain language that further identifies the role human activity is playing in increasing global temperatures through burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions			2
the last report , in 2007 , indicated that it was " very likely " that humans were responsible for most of the observed warming -- a judgment that corresponds to a confidence level greater than 90 %			2
a draft that leaked in august raised that confidence level to " extremely likely , " or greater than 95 % confidence that humans are responsible for the majority of global warming through carbon pollution			1
the impacts of this warming are already being seen through increases in extreme weather events such as heat waves , droughts and extreme flooding events , which the assessment will highlight			0
the report will lay out projections for climate change through the end of the century , based upon four different carbon emission scenarios			1
those range from a low end which would require significant cutbacks in emissions , to a worst - case scenario in which carbon emissions would continue to climb unabated			0
the projections will provide more details about sea - level rise , for which observations show rates increasing , and should give a more precise estimate of the levels we will see at the end of the century			2
loss of sea ice will also be addressed , and the report will discuss the accelerating loss of sea ice in the @entity58 and the slight increase of ice seen in the @entity61			0
hundreds of experts weigh in the latest assessment report from the @entity64 brings together the latest research from top scientists around the field			2
it contains a " summary for policymakers " aimed at guiding politicians and lawmakers worldwide on decisions regarding the environment over the next several years			2
the @entity9 panel releases a report every five or six years			0
friday 's report is the culmination of work by over 250 authors from 39 countries and was subject to an extensive review process involving more than 1,000 experts			0
more than 850 expert authors from 85 countries contributed research for the full report , which will be released in three stages through april			0
the first , on the physical science behind climate change , accompanies the summary for policymakers			1
the second , expected in march , will cover " impacts and vulnerabilities " of climate change ; the third , on mitigation efforts , is set to go out in april			1
@entity99 : why @entity100 forced cities to take lead on climate change climate change may increase violence , study shows critics of the report despite the overall breadth of the scientific expertise involved , and the extensive review and approval process , the @entity109 spark quite a few criticisms , from both climate change believers and skeptics			1
skeptics claim the @entity64 exists only to produce further evidence supporting the idea of man - made climate change while ignoring opposing research			1
but climate change activists , and many climate scientists , believe that the @entity64 's consensus - seeking policy produces conclusions and estimates that are too conservative			1
another often - cited critique of the report is that , due to its size and lengthy approval process , it is already outdated by the time it is released			0
several important studies already have been published in the past year in the constantly evolving science of climate change that will not be included in this assessment			1
despite the critics , this week 's document will serve as a major measuring stick for the current state of the world 's climate and what type of change is in store			0
the summary for policymakers will be available friday at @entity148			0
climate sticker shock : @entity58 thaw could cost $ 60 trillion			0

the @entity64 released a report every five or six years
a draft that leaked in august said there is more *certainty* that humans are playing a role
the report will lay out projections for climate change through the end of the century
the first *section* of the report is aimed at assisting policymakers
