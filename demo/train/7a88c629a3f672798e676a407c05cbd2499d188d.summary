-- in just a few short weeks , rabbi @entity1 could wake up at his home in @entity3 , @entity4 , with @entity6 leader @entity5 camped a few feet from his front lawn			1
@entity5 may be staying in a tent on the front lawn of a @entity4 house owned by the @entity6 mission			1
the authoritarian ruler of @entity6 is rumored to be planning to stay in an air - conditioned tent on the front lawn of a house owned by the @entity6 mission when he attends the @entity17 meeting in september			1
members of the predominately @entity20 community are less than enthused about a visit from a leader who has made anti-zionist statements in the past			1
the recent release of the convicted @entity27 bomber to @entity6 has heightened the animosity			2
on monday , sen. @entity29 , @entity30 , called for the @entity32 @entity31 to restrict @entity5 's travel to the area around @entity17 headquarters in @entity36 , saying in a letter to secretary of state @entity38 he " was particularly concerned by news reports indicating that [ @entity5 ] plans to stay in @entity4 , where the families of many @entity42 103 victims reside			1
" a representative from the @entity6 mission in @entity36 would not confirm @entity5 will stay in @entity3 , only that he is scheduled to come to @entity36			1
@entity5 has a history of setting up his extensive tent when visiting other countries , including @entity48 and @entity49			1
media reports have said that his request to pitch his tent in @entity53 had been denied , and the @entity4 property was a likely second choice			2
@entity1 said he had previously been willing to approach @entity5 's rumored visit with an open mind , but he backtracked after the @entity27 bomber 's release			2
" judging by his actions , he has n't changed one iota , " @entity1 said			0
" he loves terrorists and welcomes them as heroes and speaks with a forked tongue			0
as soon as he had the opportunity he lionized people who committed murderous acts			0
i do n't want him or his security team near my home			0
" @entity3 mayor @entity72 said he was not informed of plans to erect a tent on the property , and no special permissions were requested from the zoning department			0
only through neighborhood residents and media coverage was he alerted to construction on the house that , according to @entity1 , began around three months ago			0
the mayor said he was " mortified as a @entity82 and embarrassed as an @entity32 that a financier of terrorism is on @entity32 soil			1
[ @entity5 ] is someone who has embraced terrorism and has not changed his spots			2
" @entity72 said the @entity6 mission has " not paid a nickel " on taxes for the property , and said he would only be " willing to sit down with him if he brings a check to cover years of back taxes and overtime pay for the additional police forces needed for his stay , and apologizes to the @entity82 residents and the @entity27 victims ' families of @entity4			1
" @entity1 , in a piece posted thursday on the @entity103 , where he is a regular contributor , said the residence had been left " derelict and neglected " for many years until the recent construction			0
in opposition to @entity5 's possible visit to @entity3 , @entity1 said he plans several steps , including legal action , which he said would be in response to construction workers knocking down his fence and cutting down his trees			0
" my plan is to sue them , extract as much money as possible and use @entity6 money for planting trees instead of buying bombs , " he wrote in another @entity103 piece monday			0
@entity1 and @entity72 also are planning a protest at the construction site on sunday .			0
