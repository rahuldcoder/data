-- @entity1 , famous for producing world - class soccer players and infectious " makossa " music , is on the dawn of becoming known for something else ... tourism			1
tourism arrivals grew by 35 % in 2012 , and @entity1 has a vast geographical diversity characterized by forest , savannah and mountains , alongside a population of over 250 ethnic groups			1
its diversity in terrain and culture has led to @entity1 being referred to as " @entity18 " or " all @entity19 in one country			1
" it also boasts some of the richest and most diverse wildlife in the continent and is a dreamland for safari lovers , eco tourists , hikers and culture seekers			1
on a recent trip to @entity1 i spoke with @entity31 , the minister of tourism and leisure , who is championing the growth of tourism in the country			1
" if you mention @entity1 , very few people can look at a map and point out where the country is ... our ambition is to be one of the best known and most attractive destinations in sub @entity19 , " he said			1
i spent the majority of my trip in the coastal @entity45 , an area comprised of relaxing beaches , mountains , wildlife and cultural discoveries			1
here are some of the area 's highlights			0
@entity53 @entity54 is the capital of the @entity45 , and home to the breathtaking and awe - inspiring @entity53 , an active volcano that stands at over 13,200 feet ( 4,023 meters ) above sea level			1
officially the highest mountain in @entity59 and @entity60 , waking up at sunrise at foot of the mountain allows for a spectacularly clear view of the mountain , including the peak , which is an amazing sight to behold			0
read this : @entity68 : from warzone to holiday paradise ? @entity53 provides an amazing hiking opportunity			1
the landscape ranges from tropical rainforest to savannah , and from a bare snow - capped summit to caves and waterfalls , as well as boasting rare birds and flowers			2
hiking tours ranging from a few hours to a full three - day excursion , complete with a guide and someone to carry your bags , can be easily arranged locally for $ 120 - $ 150 per person			2
black sand beaches if hiking is not your thing , then you might prefer relaxing in the picturesque town of @entity92 , perfectly located between @entity53 and the @entity93			1
driving to @entity92 you are surrounded by miles of lush greenery			1
with views of the @entity93 , clear blues skies and @entity53 in the background the landscape is simply stunning and the photo opportunities endless			1
you will be jumping out of your vehicle several times to simply breathe in the amazing air and absorb the view			0
@entity92 is a popular area for tourists as there is so much to do in this pretty town			1
wandering @entity92 during the day you will find a picture - perfect busy town ( exercise caution when crossing the busy streets ) with friendly locals , cafes and the famous black sand beaches			1
in the town i highly recommend sampling the roadside treats of freshly made @entity118 crepes , a throwback to the country 's @entity118 colonial past			2
the crepes are delicious -- a popular and familiar treat for the @entity124 palate			0
the black sand beaches are home to beach lovers and local fisherman , and it is fascinating to sit back and watch the fishermen going about their chores			0
be sure to ask before you take any pictures of the fisherman as they may not take kindly to the intrusion			0
nevertheless , if you are lucky like i was , you could be taken on an impromptu and interesting tour of the area where the fish are cleaned , smoked and prepared to eat			0
the fish found in @entity92 are mainly bar , ribbon and cuttle fish and are the freshest i have ever tasted			1
wildlife and tea @entity145 provide the opportunity to see rare flowers and walk amongst the 1,500 closely planted trees , many of which are medicinal			2
the abundance of trees and flowers makes the gardens a paradise for birds			2
this is a great place to visit for the entire family ; it has a large open - air arena where local traditional dancing and drumming take place , and the dancers actively encourage visitors to join in as they teach you traditional dance moves			0
there is also a wonderful arts and crafts store where you can buy incredible souvenirs from all over @entity1			1
the @entity172 is a thrilling treat			0
a collaboration between the government of @entity1 and the @entity177 , the center is home to 15 species of primate and several other animals native to @entity1			1
the center is designed so you feel like you are walking almost amongst the primates despite the electrified wire fences that secure both the animals and visitors			2
a visit to the @entity189 , the oldest tea plantation in @entity1 , is another treat			1
visitors are taken on a tour around the plantation where you witness each step of the entire tea - making process			0
at the end of the tour you are treated to a delicious cup of tea presented in a beautiful @entity203 - style traditional cup and saucer accompanied by a delightful @entity206 biscuit			2
the juxtaposition of this against the @entity210 backdrop is cause for pause , amusement and delight			0
somber reminders of slavery like other countries in @entity210 , @entity1 was a part of the dark history of slavery when for centuries many @entity220 were taken from the continent to @entity223 , and the @entity224			1
not far from @entity92 is @entity226 village			1
situated on the @entity93 , @entity226 served as a slave port , and while not as intact as other slave castles in @entity210 , you can still clearly see the remains and relics of the former fortress			0
read this : ' slave trade ghost town ' currently under restoration , the path to @entity236 requires a long walk through bamboo and bushes , and poignantly this is the same path thousands of slaves walked for centuries on their way to the port			0
not to everyone 's taste , there is a reenactment of captured slaves complete with shackles and chains , which brings the experience of the slave port to a dramatic reality			0
nightlife nightlife in @entity92 is lively and fun , and ranges from outdoor restaurants to packed nightclubs			1
the @entity260 has a fantastic restaurant that serves an array of @entity1 dishes and local delicacies such as bitter leaf stew , crocodile and cassava as well as shrimp and fish prepared with local spices like fufu and @entity272			2
plantains and cocoyams seem to accompany almost every meal			0
@entity118 wines are plentiful in @entity1 , but by far the most popular alcoholic beverages are beers , and @entity1 has its own @entity279 and 33 beer , which are as popular as they are strong			2
the popular local nightclub @entity283 is part of the @entity260 hotel , and is designed with the international party going crowd in mind			0
another popular nightclub is @entity290			0
part of the @entity292 , @entity290 was much like any other club you would find elsewhere in the world , with a great sound system and energized crowd that dance to everything from local makossa rhythms , to international pop music			0
this is just a small sample of what @entity1 has to offer tourists			2
it must be pointed out that the country is an emerging tourist destination , which means there is still much work to be done in fully developing the tourism sector			0
while the country is easy to travel around , there are advisories warning against travel to the @entity312 and certain border areas			0
amenities can vary dramatically , and even the most seasoned @entity210 traveler should be prepared to fully embrace a certain amount of ruggedness			0
nevertheless , @entity1 is one of the most rapidly developing tourism markets in @entity320 , providing a chance for tourists to visit this stunning part of the world before everyone else catches on			2
