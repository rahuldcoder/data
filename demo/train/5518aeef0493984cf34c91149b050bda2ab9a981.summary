-- no cyanide remained in the exhumed body of @entity7 lottery winner @entity5 , preventing investigators from determining how the toxin entered his body , the @entity2 medical examiner said friday			1
still , dr. @entity11 maintained his determination from january : that blood samples taken after @entity5 's death in july show the 46 - year - old died of cyanide poisoning and that the manner of death was homicide			1
officials in january exhumed the body of @entity5 -- who died the day after the @entity7 lottery issued him a check for about $ 425,000 for winning a scratch - off game -- hoping to determine how cyanide entered his system			1
" @entity29 has a short half - life , and it may be lost over the postmortem interval unless the tissues are adequately preserved , " @entity28 said friday			0
" in this case , due to advanced putrefaction of the tissue , no cyanide was detected " after the exhumation			0
investigators initially ruled @entity5 's manner of death natural			2
but after being prompted by a relative , technicians retested @entity5 's blood , leading to @entity28 's cause of death determination in january , more than a week before the body was exhumed			1
@entity28 also said friday that coronary artery disease was a contributing cause to @entity5 's death , because the autopsy showed one of his major coronary arteries was 75 % blocked			2
" since cyanide affects oxygen utilization in the tissues , it follows logically that a natural disease process that already limits blood flow to the heart could render an individual particularly susceptible to death due to this toxin , " he said			2
before the exhumation , @entity28 said that cyanide can evaporate from a body after death and that it was possible it would not still be present			0
the autopsy results have been turned over to @entity68 police , who have been investigating the case as a murder			0
@entity0 's @entity72 contributed to this report .			0
