-- four days after @entity3 's massive earthquake , efforts are under way to bury the dead as thousands of bodies crumpled in the streets of @entity8 lay exposed to the sun or draped in sheets and cardboard			1
throughout the city , people covered their noses from the stench and some resorted to face masks			0
@entity0 correspondents in @entity3 reported efforts to remove the bodies , including the creation of a mass grave			1
it 's still unclear how many people have been killed in tuesday 's earthquake ; the prime minister suggested there could be several hundreds of thousands			1
@entity0 's @entity27 , reporting friday from a mass grave on the outskirts of @entity8 , described seeing hundreds of bodies mixed with garbage in open pits			1
some bodies were bulldozed into the half - filled pits			1
" these people will vanish , " @entity27 said in a phone report			1
" no one will know what happened to them			0
that 's one of the many horrors			2
" there 's no system in place here			2
literally these people here are being collected off the streets , dumped into a dump truck , then brought out here and dumped in the pits , " he said			0
the fear of disease is frequently the reason for rapidly burying bodies in mass graves			1
but contrary to popular belief , bodies do not cause epidemics after natural disasters , experts said			2
" the reality is that most of the disease that live in us -- once our body is dead they ca n't survive very long , " said @entity63 , an epidemiologist at the @entity64			2
fecal matter from the deceased could contaminate the water supply , posing a risk , but " it 's nowhere near the risk of all the survivors living in the streets with no sanitation , " said @entity63 , who contributed to the @entity79 's guidelines on managing bodies after a natural disaster			1
there has never been an epidemic after a natural disaster that was traced to exposure to bodies , according to the @entity79			1
the chief priority must lie with the living , experts said			0
" body collection is not the most urgent task after a natural disaster , " according to the @entity79 's 2006 guidance on the @entity94 after disasters			1
" the priority is to care for survivors			0
there is no significant public health risk associated with the presence of bodies			1
nevertheless , bodies should be collected as soon as possible and taken away for identification			2
" mass graves , it warned , are " not justified on public health grounds			1
rushing to dispose of bodies without proper identification traumatizes families and communities and may have serious legal consequences			2
" " there 's always talks about mass graves because that 's always the easiest solution , " said @entity112 , vice president of commercial services at @entity113 , a disaster management company that responds to mass fatality accidents			1
" we do n't strongly recommend them			0
however , sometimes in situations in very developing nations , that 's the only thing to do			0
" in cases of mass graves , teams should at least document or photograph the individual for future identification , he said			1
@entity131 has deployed an emergency response assessment team to @entity3			0
@entity112 was part of the crew that responded to the tsunami in @entity136 in 2004 and @entity137 , @entity138 , after @entity139 in 2005			0
having bodies on the street is very distressing to survivors			0
" that 's going to be very stressful , " @entity112 said			0
" it 's hot temperatures and that 's not a pleasant sight			0
and the hotter the weather , the quicker the decomposition			0
" @entity152 starts as early as the day of death , bringing stench and pests			0
" when you have bodies on the street that begin to decompose , you eventually get maggot infestation because of flies and you have a potential of rats , " said @entity156 , the disaster task force leader of the @entity158			0
at one of the capital city 's cemeteries , people opened up old crypts and shoved corpses of quake victims into them before resealing them			1
workers loaded bodies -- piled on the sides of roads -- into the basket of a front - loader tractor , which then deposited them into blood - stained dump trucks , according to @entity0 correspondents in @entity3			1
" there 's little dignity in death in @entity8 these days , " @entity27 said in his report			1
the @entity186 is deploying mortuary teams to identify and bury the dead in a public safety rescue mission , @entity190 , secretary of health and human services , said thursday			2
after huge disasters , mortuary teams often face logistical nightmares , working with little resources , thousands of bodies , collapsed infrastructure , language barriers and different cultural and religious views			0
after working in the aftermath of landslides , cyclones , hurricanes and tsunamis with mass fatalities , @entity63 realized the lack of a guidelines for handling the bodies was a recurring problem			2
" what we often see are these pictures of mass graves which are dug three feet deep with hundreds of bodies thrown into this large hole , " @entity63 said			1
" that 's discouraged in preference to having a more organized situation with a long trench grave and putting bodies in an ordered way , or marked graves so people know where the victims are buried			1
" one possible solution is to move the bodies to a temporary , organized collection point and to gather as much information to help with future identification , said @entity156 , who served as a national officer for @entity232 , a national response team designed to provide mortuary assistance in mass fatality incidents			2
after the tsunami killed 225,000 people in 2004 , various @entity136 countries handled the dead differently based on location and available resources			0
while none of the countries affected by the tsunami had enough refrigerated storage to handle the corpses , many found alternatives by burying the dead in temporary , shallow graves with the intent to exhume them later			2
other bodies were hastily buried within 24 hours in mass graves			1
" the parallels are mass fatalities and catastrophic events , " @entity112 said			0
" we have a significant loss of life ; we have people that are unknown ; we have a significant number of missing people			0
the one minor difference in @entity263 was that it was isolated to shoreline about a mile in			0
here you have total destruction of an infrastructure system			0

@entity0 's @entity27 reported on a mass grave with hundreds of bodies
fear of disease is frequently the reason for rapidly burying bodies in mass graves
this theory is *unfounded* , because disease - causing agents die with the corpse
@entity79 report : " rapid mass burial of victims is not justified on public health grounds "
