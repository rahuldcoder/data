winds to a close , here are five takeaways from the event , which traditionally features lots of premieres , star power and schmoozing			1
@entity10 is n't good in bed -- or so quipped @entity12 when asked how her character , @entity13 , could walk out on him on their wedding night in @entity17 's " @entity16			1
" judging by the ecstatic reaction he received from the @entity2 audience , @entity10 has no reason to worry			1
if @entity12 does n't want him , there are plenty of eager replacements waiting in the wings			2
@entity25 could be a serious @entity26 contender			2
@entity25 has shown his mettle before of course , in @entity30 's " @entity29 , " when he was nominated for @entity31 ; in @entity33 's " @entity32 " ; as well as in last year 's @entity35 vet drama " @entity36 " ( when he was nominated in the @entity38 slot )			2
but he 's never given such a commanding and well - rounded performance as he shows us in " @entity41 , " a second collaboration with " messenger " director @entity43 , a no - holds - barred portrait of a corrupt cop penned by @entity47			2
@entity25 does n't just dare to show us this dinosaur 's very dark side , he also dares us not to care			2
the classics are going multicultural			0
the brits have always been famed for their literary adaptations and costume dramas , but they never used to look like this			1
in the past , @entity56 's romantic hero ( or anti-hero ) @entity58 has been played by @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
but @entity62 is the first director to cast a black actor in the part -- in fact two black actors , as she also tackles the full scope of the story , from @entity58 's arrival on the moors as a child to his return as a grown man ( played by newcomer @entity73 )			1
while literary purists may see the sense in that casting , they will have to take a deeper breath before sizing up @entity81 's updated version of @entity83 's " @entity82 " ( previously filmed by @entity84 with @entity85 )			1
@entity81 -- who once relocated " @entity87 " to the @entity86 -- has switched the action to modern - day @entity89 , and cast the luminous " @entity92 " @entity91 as @entity93 , or rather " @entity94			1
" @entity83 would probably also be surprised by the lashings of sex @entity81 has worked into this provocative drama			0
@entity98 ca n't get enough of it			1
first , the " x-men : @entity104 " star played @entity106 's heir apparent , @entity105 , in @entity108 's witty history of the early years of psychoanalytic theory , " @entity109 , " in which @entity105 embarks on a reckless affair with a masochistic patient played by @entity113			0
then he showed up as a contemporary sex addict in @entity116 's hardcore drama " @entity115 , " a stunning performance that won him the @entity118 at the recent @entity119			0
asked how he researched this role , @entity98 insisted he spent quality time in bed -- with his script			1
@entity124 will never live down his past			0
at least , not in his native @entity126 , where a generation apparently grew up on the young @entity124 's adventures in " @entity129 " and " @entity131 " and wo n't let him forget it			0
" @entity129 " was the first thing he was asked about after the premiere of " drive			0
" somehow , the show had passed by his " drive " co-star , @entity137 , who needed filling in on how it fitted in before @entity124 's " @entity140 " days			0
@entity124 took it on the chin			0
asked at the end of the session if there was any message he hoped unified his diverse acting roles , he deadpanned : " basically , i 'm just trying to relive ' @entity131 ' every time			1
that was the high point for me			0

there was lots to learn at the @entity2
