, it all seems too good to be true			2
because of course , it is : it turns out he 's got a wife in @entity19 ( @entity20 ) and a barely - legal blond ( @entity23 model @entity22 ) in the @entity24			2
@entity20 , a maniac in floral capri pants , actually makes her mannerisms work here ; she 's so stunned by her husband 's betrayal that she latches onto @entity3 like a kewpie - doll barnacle , and the movie becomes an inspired oddball buddy comedy for a good half hour , until the pair track down @entity35 and all three — '' the wife , the lawyer , the boobs '' — join forces to take @entity40 down			1
that 's when the movie ( directed by @entity43 , probably best known for " @entity44 " ) gets sillier , and a lot more slapstick			0
yes , the guy 's a cheating a * * hat , but do we really need @entity51 tricks like laxatives in his scotch and female hormones in his morning smoothie ? @entity58 , as @entity3 's ruthlessly bodacious assistant , and @entity60 , as @entity20 's sane , handsome brother , both have nice turns , but " @entity66 " really is , in its own broad - strokes way , about just these women , and female friendship			1
