-- @entity1 immigrated to the @entity2 from @entity3 with only $ 5 and a @entity4			1
the first thing he saw when he landed at @entity6 were all the colorfully painted buildings			0
" people paint their house yellow , white , red , blue and i said , ' wow , there 's so much paint in this country ! ' " @entity1 says			1
" i said , ' when i get money in this country , i 'm going to buy paint and take paint back home			1
' " from that idea , @entity19 was born			0
@entity1 , who is 38 and works as a health care consultant , states the mission : " to recycle leftover paint from businesses and residents , processes it and then donate it to vulnerable families in developing countries all around the world			1
" @entity1 explains the process for making paint in @entity3			1
" we cut down trees and we started fire			0
we pick out rocks from the river and we put it inside the fire and close the fire for a week			0
and once it 's done , it 's a wonderful powder			0
" he points out that this type of paint washes away in the rain			2
@entity1 's nonprofit organization wants to make a lasting difference			1
two years ago , @entity1 started going to construction sites in the @entity48 area , asking them what they did with their leftover paint			1
he told them , " i want to collect your paint and take it someplace where people do n't have access to paint			2
we 'll give them paint and we 'll change their lives			2
that 's when i started collecting paint			2
" the @entity2 @entity66 estimates that approximately 10 % of the 637 million gallons of paint sold annually is left over , equal to about 64 million gallons per year			2
so far , @entity1 has donated 6,000 gallons of paint to projects in @entity70 , @entity3 and @entity71			1
he recently returned from @entity72 , where he donated 200 gallons of paint to an orphanage for children who lost their parent to hiv / aids			1
" we looked at schools , hospitals , family homes and they were not painted			0
it really touched my heart to see the bacteria on the walls that were not painted			0
i said we have to do something , " he says			0
those looking to donate their leftover paint can visit the website of the group , @entity91 , and fill out a request for a pickup			2
@entity94 , a consultant in @entity48 , says he donated his paint for several reasons			1
" recycling is number one and helping people is obviously number two			0
i think he 's taken something very difficult for people to do correctly , that 's recycling paint and created a way to do it and do it safely			2
and quite honestly , he 's made it very inexpensive for people			0
it can be very expensive to get rid of large amounts of paint			1
" @entity109 , museum information specialist at the @entity110 in @entity48 , was thrilled to be able to donate the museum 's leftover paint to such a good cause			1
" i was really excited to hear about @entity19 and the use for the paint in @entity117 nations because we have such a hard time getting rid of paint , and this kills two birds with one stone			2
it keeps the paint out of the landfills and it also goes to a good use , " @entity94 says			0
although he has received phone calls from all around the country , @entity1 gets most of his paint donations from the @entity48 area			1
in addition to paint donations , @entity1 also receives monetary donations to help offset cost of shipping the paint			1
he does n't do it alone either ; he has a board of directors that consists of volunteer small business owners and government officials			0
after picking up the paint , @entity1 drives to one of three storage units			1
" the other units are already completely full , " he says			0
as he slides up the door to the unit , it 's obvious ; this one is almost full as well			0
" we used to have a small warehouse where we would process the paint			1
we would separate the paint by color , by brand , by characteristic and then go through a consolidation process			1
we put it all into five - gallon containers and that we ship to people in the developing world			0
" @entity1 says that the calls for paint donations have grown from 12 weekly to between 300 and 400 hundred per day			1
now , he needs to find a new warehouse to start processing paint again			0
" we 've been receiving a lot of paint			0
we need that paint , so we can give paint to everybody , to beautify the world , that 's my goal			1
but we need someplace where we can process the paint , " he says			2
students from @entity175 have partnered with @entity19 to design a machine that can process the paint			1
the board of directors for @entity19 has been working to raise the $ 95,000 it will cost to build the machine			0
" we will be able to make 3,000 gallons of paint per day if we have that machine			2
that would be my dream come true , " @entity1 says			2
@entity1 recalls a letter that he received from a woman in @entity71 who received paint			1
" her painted house uplifted her spirits			0
she feel the kids bring joy in the house because she can hear the noise , they are so happy			0
we bring joy with the paint we were able to donate			0
to me , that touched my heart			0
