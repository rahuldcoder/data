@entity0 remembers all too well the feeling of not being sure where he was			0
he suffered a concussion during the third game of his high school football season last year , and had to sit out for the rest of the season			1
" it felt like the entire helmet was just pressing in your head , like your head was expanding , " said @entity0 , 15 , of @entity8 , @entity9			2
football teams across the country are getting the message : it 's time to tackle concussions			1
in a landmark move thursday , thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the @entity24			1
according to court documents , the @entity24 will pay $ 765 million to fund medical exams , concussion - related compensation , medical research for retired @entity24 players and their families , and litigation expenses			1
it 's an issue for more than the nation 's top football players			1
there are approximately 1,100,000 teens playing high school football , according to @entity37			1
and in organized youth leagues , there are another 3 million			0
concussions result from blows to the head , such as when a player collides with another in a sporting event			1
" in a football game , when someone takes a hard hit , the helmet does a pretty good job of protecting the skull from getting a skull fracture , " dr. @entity46 , a neurosurgeon and @entity48 's chief medical correspondent , told @entity49			2
" but what is really happening when someone is running down the field and ... they get hit -- the brain keeps moving inside the skull			0
" it 's not so much the hit , although that 's important , but the sudden acceleration and deceleration of the brain that causes the concussion , @entity46 said			0
confusion , nausea , headache and loss of consciousness are some of the immediate symptoms of concussions , but they can also have longer lasting effects			1
severe impacts to the head can lead to bleeding or permanent nerve damage			2
and recent research has shown that repeated hits to the head can lead to a brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity86			2
in the 2012 football season , there were two fatalities directly related to football , both in semi-professional football , and both during regularly scheduled games , according to the @entity92 [ @entity93 ]			1
" in 2012 , one of the semi-professional players was hit by a blindsided block on a punt return and the second player was involved in a helmet - to - helmet collision , " the report said			2
among high school football athletes , there were nine indirect fatalities -- one from heat stroke , four related to the heart , two from asthma , one from lighting , and one of an unknown cause			1
none were impact - related , but earlier this month a teen in @entity113 died after he broke his neck while making a tackle during a scrimmage game			0
over the last 10 years , an average of fewer than three boys a year have died from on - field injuries playing high school football , according to the @entity121 at the @entity122			1
more concerning to experts is the repeated hits they 're sustaining on the field			0
a professional football player receives an estimated 900 to 1,500 blows to the head during a single season , according to the @entity130 in @entity131			1
how many is that over a lifetime ? @entity24 concussion fast facts the @entity24 has initiated strict sideline concussion rules and cognitive tests , to be administered by trainers and doctors who can not be overruled by coaching staffs			1
but changes are happening on lower levels as well			0
the @entity142 rules committee approved rule changes earlier this year regarding what should happen when players ' helmets come off of their heads during games			2
to minimize risks , these rules included an illegal personal contact foul mandate : " no player or nonplayer shall initiate contact with an opposing player whose helmet has come completely off			2
" also , it will be illegal " for a player whose helmet comes completely off during a down to continue to participate beyond the immediate action in which the player is engaged			0
" any player whose helmet comes off during the game is also forced to sit out at least one play			0
the @entity37 announced earlier this month that it has partnered with @entity167 football to endorse a program that promotes high school football player safety			1
the program is called @entity171 , and it currently involves 32 high schools in eight states			1
in 2014 , any high school in the country will be able to participate			1
high school programs that participate each assign a @entity177 , who is trained by @entity179 to instruct coaches , parents and players on specific tackling mechanics			1
the techniques are aimed at reducing helmet contact , concussion recognition and response protocols , and ensure adequate fitting for helmets and shoulder pads			0
@entity191 will incorporate about 4,000 high school student athletes this year , as well as youth football programs that represent nearly 600,000 youth players in all 50 states and @entity196			1
a lot of schools in the @entity131 area are requiring pre-season cognitive testing for football players , so that if a player gets a concussion , he can be re-tested and the results can be compared to the original screening , said @entity207 , athlete trainer and clinical coordinator at the @entity130			1
@entity207 conducts education , pre-injury and post-injury testing throughout the @entity131 area			0
" i think as different things are happening -- whether it 's @entity24 lawsuits , or more media attention on things like concussions -- i think a lot more parents and schools are willing to try to protect their kids a little bit more , and get more education , " she said			1
@entity207 has found that many student athletes -- she mainly works with children 18 and under -- do not know the risks of concussions			2
she educates them about prevention and symptoms			2
she keeps it basic and does not talk about the long - term risks of concussions that have been getting a lot of attention in research			2
that 's because , in her view , " we do n't have the research available to us yet to actually concretely say anything			0
" some parents are taking matters into their own hands			0
@entity0 's mother , @entity245 , was n't satisfied with the normal training on her son 's team , so she hired a personal trainer to help him avoid concussions in the future			0
he 's learned how to properly hit , and when to let the play go , over the past couple of months , she said			0
" we hope that it makes him a smarter player			0
" @entity0 said his team passed out new football helmets this season that are designed to minimize the risk of concussion more than old ones this season			2
he got one because of his injury last year			0
@entity0 suffered attention problems in school for months after his concussion , and sat closer to the front of the class than normal because of eyesight difficulties , his mother said			0
training for this season -- his first since the injury -- began august 19			0
his mother is nervous about him suffering another concussion , but @entity0 is not			0
still , they 've agreed : " if he does get another concussion , then football 's done , " @entity0 said .			0
