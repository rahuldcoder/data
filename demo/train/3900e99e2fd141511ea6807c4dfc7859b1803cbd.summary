@entity3 security forces backed by @entity5 monks have " committed crimes against humanity " in a campaign of ethnic cleansing that has displaced more than 125,000 @entity8 in the southwest of the country , according to a new report from @entity12			1
the report comes as the @entity14 was due to meet this week to decide whether to lift sanctions on @entity3 , the @entity16 country also known as @entity3			2
the @entity17 are a stateless @entity19 minority living in @entity20 -- thought to number between 800,000 and one million -- who claim they have been persecuted by @entity3 's military during its decades of authoritarian rule			1
though many @entity17 have only known life in @entity3 , they are viewed by @entity28 's estimated three million @entity27 as intruders from neighboring @entity30			1
the rights group interviewed more than 100 people on both sides of the conflict following sectarian violence in @entity20 in 2012 in which more than 180 people were killed , and concluded that the violence had been tacitly sanctioned by the @entity3 government and its security forces			1
" the absence of accountability against those to blame lends credence to allegations that this was a government - appointed campaign of ethnic cleansing in which crimes against humanity were committed , " the report stated			0
witnesses described how security forces stood by or joined in with @entity53 men wielding machetes , swords , homemade guns and @entity57 as they descended on villages in what appeared to be a coordinated series of attacks on townships over a wide area of the state			1
@entity12 said that satellite imagery from just 5 of the 13 townships attacked since june showed destruction of 4,862 structures across 348 acres of mostly @entity19 - owned residential property			1
in the worst incident at @entity73 village on october 23 , 2012 , witnesses told @entity12 how security forces aided local mobs by disarming @entity17 of the primitive weapons they were carrying to defend themselves			1
during the daylong attack , at least 70 @entity17 were killed including 28 children of which 13 were aged under five			2
" first the soldiers told us , ' do not do anything , we will protect you , we will save you ' , so we trusted them , " a 25 - year - old @entity17 survivor told @entity12			1
" but later they broke that promise			0
the @entity53 beat and killed us very easily			0
the security did not protect us from them			0
" the rights group blamed local @entity5 monks and the two - year - old nationalist @entity91 ( @entity91 ) for encouraging and orchestrating the violence			0
between june and october , according to the report , these and other ultra-nationalist groups issued pamphlets and public statements demonizing @entity17 , at times using the phrase " ethnic cleansing			2
" " during the first wave of violence in june security forces not only stood by and watched as @entity19 communities were being attacked but in some cases they directly participated in those attacks , " @entity104 told @entity105 from the @entity107 office of @entity12			1
" in the time between june and october ( when the second wave of attacks occurred ) there was a high degree of public organizing was taking place promoting ethnic cleansing in @entity20			0
" public statements were released by monk 's associations , political groups and others and the tensions were rising			0
the authorities did nothing to intervene , to promote peace and reconciliation , nothing to prevent further violence from occurring			0
" he said the government continues to blame " communal violence " when it knew about the attacks and could have prevented them , adding that authorities were blocking aid to displaced victims			2
@entity12 said @entity17 in holding camps were at grave risk of lethal waterborne diseases if they were not moved to higher ground before the rainy season in may			1
" there are tens of thousands of people being denied adequate humanitarian aid and the responsibility for this falls squarely on the government , " @entity104 said			2
while @entity12 acknowledged that local @entity150 had also been displaced by the violence , the burden of the humanitarian disaster had fallen on the @entity17 population who have suffered decades of abuse under discriminatory @entity3 citizenship laws			1
@entity3 does not recognize them as citizens or one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country			2
" some @entity53 have suffered greatly in this situation , " @entity104 said			0
" in june , there was violence perpetrated by both @entity17 muslims and @entity53 @entity27 although it was there was a much smaller level of displacement among the @entity53 community			2
" for example , @entity5 monks in @entity169 explained to me how at least 16 @entity53 @entity27 had died in the violence in the township			0
" he said that , for the most part , @entity53 @entity27 have resumed life as usual , attending to their fields , going to tea shops and monasteries while @entity17 @entity8 are still subject to abuse from security forces and live under an active policy of segregation and containment within the government 's camps			1
" there is a serious concern that the government will not take seriously the right of these displaced people to return to their homes , " @entity104 said			1
but @entity3 presidential spokesman @entity193 accused @entity12 of timing its report to coincide with the @entity14 sanctions decision			1
" the government will not pay attention to such a one - sided report , " he said in comments posted on his @entity198 page			0
last month , @entity3 's president @entity201 placed the city of @entity203 in the region under a state of emergency as sectarian strife simmered			0
the president said some were exploiting the situation to engineer violence in other parts of the country			0
" i would like to warn all political opportunists and religious extremists who try to exploit the noble teachings of these religions and have tried to plant hatred among people of different faiths for their own self - interest : their efforts will not be tolerated , " he said .			0
