-- in what might be one of the oldest corrections in the history of journalism , the editorial board of a @entity3 newspaper has retracted its predecessor 's famous panning of president @entity12 's @entity11 as " silly remarks			1
" " seven score and ten years ago , the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed , so tainted by hubris , so lacking in the perspective history would bring , that it can not remain unaddressed in our archives , " the editors of @entity15 wrote thursday , evoking the opening words and style of @entity12 's most famous speech			1
back then , the editors of the @entity30 newspaper -- an ancestor of today 's @entity33 paper -- thought so little of @entity12 's " silly remarks " that they hoped " the veil of oblivion shall be dropped over them , and that they shall be no more reposted or thought of			1
while mildly received on its delivery , the november 19 , 1863 , speech marking the consecration of the national cemetery at @entity45 , @entity3 , has gone on to become one of the most famous pieces of writing in the @entity50 canon -- inscribed on monuments , taught to schoolchildren and frequently surfacing in cultural references			0
" four score and seven years ago , " @entity12 wrote in the speech 's famous opening line , " our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal			2
" filmmaker @entity64 recently urged all @entity50 to learn and recite the speech , calling the address " some of the most important words ever spoken			0
" @entity50 reciting the @entity11 and so , on thursday , the newspaper set the record straight : " the world will little note nor long remember our emendation of this institution 's record -- but we must do as conscience demands , " the newspaper wrote			0
" in the editorial about president @entity12 's speech delivered nov. 19 , 1863 , in @entity45 , the @entity30 & @entity79 failed to recognize its momentous importance , timeless eloquence , and lasting significance			2
the @entity15 regrets the error			0
