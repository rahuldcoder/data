-- @entity2 detainees wielding " improvised weapons " clashed saturday with guards , an episode that occurred amid simmering tensions at the @entity8 military base			1
the @entity8 guards responded by firing " four less - than - lethal rounds , " the military 's @entity9 said in a statement			1
no guards or detainees suffered " serious injuries " at the facility in @entity17			2
the incident , which happened in @entity20 at the detention center , comes as some inmates have waged a weeks - long hunger strike in protest of their treatment , guards searching through @entity27 and other issues			1
since 2002 , the @entity30 detention center -- where people have been held in a range of conditions , from communal living to lone , maximum - security cells -- has held people captured outside the @entity8 in counterterrorism operations			1
as of november 2012 , there were 166 detainees in the facility , according to a government report			0
@entity42 , a @entity8 lawyer representing some of those detainees , told @entity0 late last month detainees have become increasingly frustrated with " very dire , dire conditions " and their sense that the current legal process leaves them in limbo indefinitely			1
" it leaves them with the prospect of the only way we leave @entity30 is death , " @entity42 said			0
" unfortunately , i think the men are ready to embrace this			0
" early saturday , the commander of @entity9 ordered all inmates in @entity20 moved into individual cells			1
the reason , the military explained , was " to ensure the health and security of those detainees			2
" the clashes occurred while guards tried to move inmates			2
capt. @entity69 , a @entity30 spokesman , said the decision was made after detainees starting in february -- about the same time as latest hunger strike -- began obstructing surveillance cameras , windows and glass partitions			1
these actions , which @entity69 described as " non-compliant " and " unacceptable , " made it difficult for guards to do " round - the - clock monitoring " throughout the facility			0
" suspending the detainees ' communal living privileges was in response to a coordinated effort by detainees to create an unsafe situation and limit the guard force 's observation , " the military spokesman said			1
" ... the ability to continuously monitor detainees is the only way we can provide for their health and security			0
we should have gone in earlier			0
" @entity42 , the public defender for some @entity30 detainees , has said frustrations have grown since a change in command last year , which was followed by a number of new policies			2
the lack of action in closing @entity2 -- as president @entity107 signed on to -- is furthering resentment that those held have no recourse or hope , the lawyer said			0
" it was designed ... to be exactly what it is , a legal @entity115 , " @entity42 said			0
" where there 's one way in and the only way out is in a box			0
