-- the defense budget is going down			1
thursday , president @entity2 personally announced a new strategy to align with the new limits created by the @entity5 of last fall			1
the announcement was light on the budget details to emphasize " strategy			1
" but strategy documents come and go -- it 's in budgets that we 'll see actual change			2
the biggest change is a smaller @entity15 — reports suggest troop numbers down to levels last seen in the late 1990s			0
this change is justified by the strategy 's de-emphasis of stability operations like @entity23 and @entity24 and renewed focus on @entity26 , where naval and air forces are the main tool			2
if the strategy 's blueprint is followed , we could see a fundamental change to our force structure and military posture — more airpower and naval , and fewer ground forces			1
but everyone thursday went out of their way to hedge at every turn			0
most notably , the chairman of the @entity43 @entity42 stressed that we were n't giving up the capacity to fight land wars			0
deputy secretary of defense @entity46 said his theme was reversibility			2
defense secretary @entity48 said our military will never do just one thing			1
the president said our military will be ready for the full range of contingencies and threats			1
these statements do n't sound like an overhaul in the @entity57 is imminent to reflect this new strategy			2
rather , the administration will more likely make some marginal changes to meet the new budget realities			1
the @entity15 will still prepare to fight high - intensity land campaigns			0
the @entity63 will still prepare to achieve air superiority			0
the @entity65 will still prepare to maintain a presence on the seas			0
and the @entity68 will still prepare to land on the beaches			0
the world is an uncertain place and some hedging is a good thing to protect against surprises			0
but the @entity75 has a dominant military capable of handling a lot of surprises and will maintain its strength even if we see much deeper cuts in the next decade — even cuts at the levels of previous big reductions in defense spending			1
the strategy was unveiled today to justify just shy of $ 500 billion in cuts over the next ten years , which would leave the budget in 2021 just 8 % less than it is today compared to an average from previous builddowns of 30 % less after ten years			1
the decline in war costs will account for some of that difference			0
but even at the levels of savings mandated by the sequester triggered by the supercommittee 's failure to reach a deficit reduction deal , the base defense budget would decrease by less than 20 % after ten years			1
if we were truly to tailor our force structure to a strategy , we could find significantly greater savings			2
if we embrace the current strategy document , the @entity15 could be significantly smaller and still have a cadre to build upon if we needed to conduct another long - term stability operation			0
of course , the point was raised in the press conference that we did n't plan on doing stability operations in @entity24 or @entity23			0
if we instead accept that we will do more stability operations , we could cut back the @entity65 and @entity63 to focus on the @entity15 and still have plenty of forces to respond to events in the @entity115			0
it does n't appear the administration will take the budget to the logical ends of the strategy rolled out today			1
we would have a better defense — at any spending level — if we actually made budget decisions based on strategy rather than by letting institutional concerns determine what makes up the budget			1
the press conference thursday highlighted two key facts about the defense budget			1
the topline is determined largely by external events — like our economy and fiscal crises			0
but the budget that meets that topline is determined largely by the institutions within the @entity57			2
we may be at an inflection point , as the president said , but it is unlikely that inflection will affect the @entity57 that much			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			2

president @entity2 announced a new strategy to align with defense budget cuts
@entity144 says the military could make deeper cuts and fulfill the strategy
he says military services likely to pursue its own goals despite the new strategy
@entity144 : let strategy , rather than institutions , determine how money is spent
