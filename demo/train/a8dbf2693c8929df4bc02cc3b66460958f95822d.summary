house speaker @entity0 said friday he has sued the @entity1 in federal court over its decisions to make changes to the president 's health care law , which congressional @entity7 argue were unconstitutional			1
the move was expected for months -- the @entity7 - controlled @entity9 voted to approve the lawsuit in july			0
but @entity0 had trouble retaining a law firm that would take the case because of the political furor over the controversial health care law			1
" time after time , the president has chosen to ignore the will of the @entity20 people and re-write federal law on his own without a vote of @entity23			1
that 's not the way our system of government was designed to work , " @entity0 said in statement on friday			1
he added , " if this president can get away with making his own laws , future presidents will have the ability to as well			0
the @entity9 has an obligation to stand up for the @entity35 , and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action			0
" news of the lawsuit came just minutes after @entity0 held a press conference on friday to respond to the president 's plan to circumvent @entity23 in order to make sweeping changes to the nation 's immigration system by executive order			1
the one - two punch from @entity0 marks a new era of tension between @entity7 who will officially take over @entity23 in january , and the president who has signaled that despite his party 's losses in the midterms , he plans to proceed with his agenda without @entity7 cooperation			1
after two @entity61 firms pulled out of commitments to represent the @entity9 in recent months , @entity0 hired @entity61 law professor @entity63 earlier this week			1
@entity63 is an expert on constitutional law and has appeared on multiple television networks as a legal analyst			0
@entity0 and other top congressional @entity7 leaders are also contemplating a filing a separate lawsuit challenging the president 's authority to take executive action to give 5 million immigrants temporary status			1
related : @entity0 hires third lawyer to sue @entity76 the @entity78 complaint cites two specific actions by the @entity1 regarding the implementation of the health care law			1
the first zeroes in on the decision to delay for one year the requirement that employers with over 50 employees provide health care coverage or pay penalties			1
the second maintains it was illegal for the @entity90 to transfer of billions of dollars that @entity23 has not approved to insurance companies to share the costs of providing new health plans			1
the case , filed in @entity95 , names both the @entity97 and the @entity98 , but not the president personally			0
@entity9 @entity7 agreed that @entity78 's so - called " employer mandate " should be postponed			0
the @entity9 passed a bill last summer to do so , but @entity7 members maintain that the president 's decision to act unilaterally on the delay circumvented @entity23 ' role to pass laws			2
under the @entity78 insurance companies who provide health care coverage to new customers are eligible for receive money from a government cost - sharing program to offer discounted deductibles and co-payments			1
but @entity23 never approved any new funds for this purpose , and the suit says that an estimated $ 3 billion will be paid out by the @entity90 in 2014 is an illegal action			0
if @entity90 continues to pay out money for this cost - sharing program a total of $ 178 billion could be paid to insurance companies over the next 10 years			0
the @entity7 lawsuit argues this ignores @entity23 ' power of the purse under the @entity35			0
related : oops ! @entity78 enrollment stats fudged the @entity128 dismissed the lawsuit in a statement shortly after its announcement			0
" instead of passing legislation to help expand the middle class and grow the economy , @entity0 and @entity9 @entity7 are spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars pursuing a lawsuit that is without any sound legal basis , " said @entity128 spokeswoman @entity132			2
@entity140 @entity139 called the case " meritless " on friday			0
" the fact is , this lawsuit is a bald - faced attempt to achieve what @entity7 have been unable to achieve through the political process			0
the legislative branch can not sue simply because they disagree with the way a law passed by a different @entity23 has been implemented			2
it is clear , as one leading legal scholar put it , that this lawsuit is ' an embarrassing loser , ' " @entity139 said in a written statement			0
some constitutional experts question whether the court will actually move forward with the case from @entity159 , and point out that it could be difficult to demonstrate that the @entity23 was damaged as an institution by the @entity162 's actions			0
the @entity20 @entity163 already announced this month that it was reviewing a separate legal challenge to @entity78 -- one focused on tax credits for those buying health care coverage on the federal insurance exchange			1
on immigration , @entity0 said that @entity23 " will not stand idle as the president undermines the rule of law , " but gave no specifics on how congressional @entity7 would respond to the president 's executive action			1
@entity0 told reporters that by moving ahead with unilateral action , the president chose to " deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reform that he claims to seek			1
" in a less than five minute press conference on @entity182 , the speaker said he told the president on thursday " he 's damaging the presidency itself			2
" pressed if congressional republicans would try to block the president 's executive actions by moving legislation to strip funding from federal agencies , @entity0 sidestepped the question and instead said he was reviewing various actions with his members			1
" @entity9 will in fact act , " the speaker promised			0
due to deep divisions inside the @entity9 @entity7 conference there is no consensus yet on how to try to block the president 's plan			2
many conservatives want to attach a provision to a must pass spending bill to strip funding for federal agencies to carry out the president 's plan			2
but the chairman of the spending panel argues that is impossible because the customs agency is self - funded through fees and does n't need congressional appropriations			0
and many republicans on @entity182 worry another fight on a spending bill will lead to another government shutdown			0
others are pushing to sue the president , or vote on censuring him			2
the clock is ticking for @entity0 -- government agencies run out of money on dec. 11 .			2

@entity0 announced friday his plans to sue the president over his health care law
the news came right after @entity0 *criticized* president @entity76 's immigration plans
