" it took @entity3 two hours to die , and he gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes			2
we will renew our efforts to get information about the manufacturer of drugs as well as how @entity13 came up with the experimental formula of drugs it used today , " attorney @entity6 said in a statement			0
he added : " @entity13 appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror -- a bungled execution			2
" @entity13 gov. @entity21 had directed the @entity22 to review the process , saying she is concerned by the length of time it took to carry out the lethal injection			1
a federal judge ordered local officials to preserve all physical evidence in @entity3 's execution			1
" one thing is certain , however , inmate @entity3 died in a lawful manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer			2
this is in stark comparison to the gruesome , vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims -- and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family , " @entity36 said			0
@entity13 's corrections department said in a statement that it followed protocol in @entity3 's execution , re-affirming his " deep sedation " seven times before he was pronounced dead			1

@entity3 was convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father			2
" i do n't believe he was gasping for air ; i do n't believe he was suffering			2
it sounded to me like was snoring , " said @entity62 , a relative of @entity3 's victims			1
" you do n't know what excruciating is			0
what 's excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood , seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood			0
and i should n't really call him a man , " she said			0
the execution procedure began at 1:52 p.m. ( 4:52 p.m. et ) and concluded , with @entity3 's being pronounced dead , at 3:49 p.m. ( 6:49 p.m. et )			1
@entity81 , a media witness from @entity82 , told reporters the execution was difficult to watch			1
he likened @entity3 's breathing to a " fish gulping for air			1
" " it was tough for everybody in that room , " he said			0
@entity91 , a reporter for the @entity92 , has witnessed five executions , including @entity3 's			1
" usually it takes about 10 minutes , the person goes to sleep			0
this was not that , " he told reporters afterward			0
" it started off looking as if it was going alright but then obviously something did n't go right			0
" @entity91 described the sound @entity3 made as a " deep , snoring , sucking air sound			1

we respectfully request that this @entity116 stop the execution and require that the @entity22 use the lifesaving provisions required in its protocol			0
" inmate objected to drugs earlier , the @entity116 lifted its brief stay of the murderer 's execution			1
@entity3 was first set to be executed at 10 a.m. local time ( 1 p.m. et ) , though it was temporarily halted when the court said it would consider his request for the justices to review his claims			2

@entity3 was the latest @entity137 death row inmate to argue that an anesthetic recently introduced in some states ' execution protocols could fail to sufficiently knock out the inmate ahead of the lethal drugs , subjecting the person to an agonizing death			1
opinion : 5 ways to improve the @entity137 death penalty @entity3 claimed among other things that the state was going to use an " experimental " drug protocol of midazolam and hydromorphone			2

@entity3 was " very concerned they were experimenting , " said attorney @entity6 , who witnessed the execution			1
" the room was silent			0
i was focusing on mr. @entity3			2

" he was still breathing and struggling to breathe and gasping and snorting			0
i have witnessed 10 executions , and i had never seen that before , " @entity6 told @entity0			0
opinion : i was 17 , on death row -- and innocent controversial @entity175 execution drugs were n't @entity3 's only contention			1
he also argued the execution should be stopped because his trial attorney was ineffective and that new evaluations from psychologists show he has cognitive impairments that would make him innocent of premeditated murder			2
some states turned to midazolam this decade after they could no longer get sodium thiopental , a drug that was regularly used for executions			0
a @entity137 manufacturer stopped producing sodium thiopental in 2009 , and countries that still produce it wo n't allow its export to the @entity137 for use in lethal injections			0

" it 's time for @entity13 and the other states still using lethal injection to admit that this experiment with unreliable drugs is a failure , " the @entity225 said in a statement			1
" instead of hiding lethal injection under layers of foolish secrecy , these states need to show us where the drugs are come from			1
until they can give assurances that the drugs will work as intended , they must stop future executions , " it read			0
@entity245 mom swaps death row for jail cell to await trial death penalty facts that may surprise you @entity252 's death penalty ruled unconstitutional @entity0 's @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .			0
