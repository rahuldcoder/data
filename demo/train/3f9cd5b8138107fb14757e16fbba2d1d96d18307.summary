-- when plans were announced to build a giant new transoceanic canal across @entity4 , the young @entity6 businessman leading the project acknowledged the widespread skepticism			1
" we do n't want it to become an international joke , " said @entity8 , a 40 - year - old with no significant engineering experience and a background he described as " very normal			2
" that was in june 2013 , when the @entity16 legislature , controlled by president @entity17 , had just allowed @entity8 to move forward with his five - year project			1
it is not certain that the canal , which would be one of the most ambitious and expensive engineering projects on @entity23 , will ever get built			1
but it looks set to move forward , and even some of the most determined doubters are starting to reconsider			2
last thursday , the government and @entity8 's company , @entity27 , announced that construction will start on dec. 22			1
the development 's estimated price tag -- $ 50 billion -- is four times the size of the entire @entity16 economy			2
the canal itself would be deeper , wider and longer than the @entity35 , just a few hundred miles to the south			1
the @entity35 's expansion is almost ready , which raises the question of why another costly canal is needed			1
the @entity16 opposition has called the project the biggest scam in the country 's history , and engineering experts are divided over whether the project is feasible			1
@entity47 , chairman of civil engineering at @entity49 , has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed			2
he worries that it will be abandoned			0
his greatest concern is severe damage to @entity4 , the largest freshwater reservoir in @entity56			2
other engineers say the quick turnaround between contract signing and construction leaves room for doubt that the plans are solid			0
and @entity64 , an engineering professor at the @entity65 who was a consultant to the @entity66 , said the @entity67 examined the @entity16 idea and concluded that it did not pose a threat to their own expansion plans			0
mystery and suspicion have surrounded the proposal from the beginning			0
to this day , nobody understands who will pay			0
when @entity78 made a surprise visit to @entity80 last july -- the first by a @entity83 president -- @entity16 wondered whether the canal figured in @entity83 's new geopolitical calculations			2
but it is the @entity88 government 's role that has most people talking			1
the country is abuzz with rumors that @entity8 is a front for @entity93 , which is looking for strategic security for its vital imports			0
@entity8 , who was born in @entity93 , has repeatedly denied the accusations			0
@entity16 officials also deny @entity83 involvement			0
@entity8 was also in town last july , startling many @entity16 by revealing the exact route of the canal			0
the announcement made the project seem real , threatening the potential displacement of people living on its path and fueling concerns from environmental groups			0
@entity88 workers have started arriving for construction that will run from the @entity112 on the @entity113 to @entity114 on the @entity115			2
by some estimates , 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path 172 miles long , up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep			0
the prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area			0
demonstrators have launched at least a dozen protest marches , and an environmental lawyer has filed suit against the project at the @entity128 , charging " the government has sold us to the @entity88			1
" the president says the project will mark a turning point in the country 's development , creating tens of thousands of jobs and giving a long - term boost to economic growth			1
but critics see something different			0
the idea of building a canal linking the @entity115 and the @entity142 across @entity4 dates back hundreds of years			1
this new , enigmatic venture , however , began almost as an @entity17 family project			1
in 2012 , the president sent his son @entity146 to @entity88			2
that 's when @entity8 first made contact with the @entity149			0
not long after that , @entity8 was in @entity80 and by june of 2013 , the president and the @entity88 businessman signed the agreement to build the canal			1
the legislature quickly rubber - stamped it			0
at home , critics say @entity17 is relinquishing national sovereignty in order to help those close to him enrich themselves			1
small farmers living along the planned path worry about displacement and environmental degradation			0
environmentalists say the proposed route , which includes a large tract across @entity4 's largest lake and its main water supply , will put the country at risk			1
whether or not @entity8 is a straw man for @entity88 's government , there is no question that a new @entity88 - built waterway across @entity178 and a project of this magnitude would expand @entity88 's influence in the region			1
a transcontinental canal , of course , is an important strategic asset			0
@entity88 's influence in @entity56 is nothing new			1
@entity93 has a voracious appetite for natural resources and very deep pockets			0
it is steadily supplanting the @entity192 as the main trading partner in the region			2
there is a difference between trade with @entity88 and trade with the @entity192			1
commercial exchanges with @entity56 firms are , for the most part , conducted with the private sector of the @entity192 , which has much weaker ties to the government in @entity205 than @entity88 firms do with their central government			1
already @entity88 has become the top trading partner for major @entity56 economies , notably @entity210 and @entity211			2
@entity93 is lending money to @entity56 , developing multiple projects and making more business inroads			0
economic ties tend to translate into political links			0
the skeptics still doubt the canal will be built , but the ambitious time line signals the parties are serious			1
the biggest mystery surrounding the project , whether it would ever get off the ground , is about to be resolved .			0

@entity225 : @entity88 man leads plan to build transoceanic canal through @entity4
it would be one of world 's most ambitious engineering projects , bigger than @entity35 canal
she says it would boost @entity88 , not @entity192 , in @entity178 . critics say @entity17 pushing for it
@entity240 : there are many skeptics , but project set to start dec. 22 . it 's looking serious now
