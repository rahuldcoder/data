-- @entity1 should be happy			0
" socialized health care " is on its way			0
the " socialist agenda " is taking over @entity5			2
and best of all , @entity7 , a " committed socialist ideologue , " is in the @entity9			1
but @entity1 , co-chair of the @entity10 , sees no reason to celebrate			0
he 's seen people with bumper stickers and placards that call @entity7 a socialist , and he has a message for them : @entity7 is n't a socialist			1
he 's not even a liberal			2
" we did n't see a great victory with the election of @entity7 , " @entity1 says , " and we certainly did n't see our agenda move from the streets to the @entity24			1
" are many @entity26 secret socialists ? @entity7 's opponents have long described him as a socialist			1
but what do actual socialists think about @entity7 ? not much , says @entity1			1
" he 's the president whose main goal is to protect the wealth of the richest 5 percent of @entity26			1
" he and others say the assertion that @entity7 is a socialist is absurd			1
" it makes no rational sense			0
it clearly means that people do n't understand what socialism is			1
" definitions of socialism vary , but most socialists believe workers and consumers who are affected by economic institutions should own or control them			1
not all socialists , though , want to confiscate personal property			2
democratic socialists are more interested in protecting ordinary people from unregulated capitalism through regulation and progressive taxation			2
some of the socialist agenda is already part of @entity26 life , according to @entity1 and others			1
@entity60 , @entity61 , unemployment benefits -- all reflect socialistic values , says @entity64 , an associate professor of history at @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 , who has researched socialist movements in the @entity26 and @entity5			1
the widely accepted notions of public education and @entity72 for college students are socialistic in origin , @entity64 says			0
they fit well with the socialistic premise that government should provide basic security from the cradle to the grave to all of its citizens , he says			0
" we assert that education should not be left up to the private market -- where those who can pay , get it and those who ca n't , do n't get it , " @entity64 says			2
" it 's a common good and in that sense it is a socialistic institution even if the @entity26 remains a capitalist nation			1
" why socialists hate @entity7 's health care bill those who call @entity7 a socialist , though , point to his policies			1
@entity98 on their hit list : " @entity100 , " which they call " socialized medicine			0
" socialists scoff at the notion			2
they do n't applaud the passage of the recent health care bill either			2
they wanted a national " single - payer " health insurance plan with a government option			0
the bill that @entity7 championed did n't have any of those features			1
@entity1 said the new health care bill only strengthens private health insurance companies			0
they get 32 million new customers and no incentive to change -- something a socialist would n't accept			1
" most of it was authored by the health care industry , " @entity1 says			0
" i call it the corporate restructuring of health care			0
" other critics point to @entity7 's @entity127 bailout -- which actually had its roots in the @entity131 administration			1
critics say it 's socialistic for government to assume control of private industry			0
@entity137 , national director of the @entity138 , says the bailout had nothing to do with socialism			2
@entity137 says a socialist leader would have at least nationalized some of the troubled banks			1
" he gave them [ the banks ] too much with no strings attached , " @entity137 says			0
" banks that were too big to fail are bigger , and they can still fail			0
" how about @entity7 's bailout of the @entity152 auto industry ? during the bailout , the federal government assumed partial ownership of @entity156			1
" it 's not socialism , " @entity137 says			2
" the mere fact that the government owns something or has a stake in it , does n't make it socialist			1
if that was true , you would say that we have a socialist army			2
the government owns the army			0
" defining socialism is complex , @entity137 says , but it starts with a simple goal : socialists want to introduce democratic features into the economy to reduce inequality			1
the economy has " to be run for the overall benefit of the entire population , not for the benefits of a very few people			0
" by that measure , @entity7 's economic policies are not socialist , he says			1
" he 's trying to save capitalism from itself rather than a radical trying to change into a new system , " @entity137 says			0
this kind of name - calling is not new			0
civil rights demonstrators and the politicians who passed @entity61 were also called socialists and communists , @entity137 says			1
" every time an expansion of the public 's right has been put forward , @entity193 have called it extreme , communistic and socialistic			2
it 's a repeated tactic because they ca n't defeat the idea			2
" a @entity201 member explains why @entity7 is a socialist those arguments do n't sway @entity204 , a @entity201 member who says @entity7 is a socialist			1
he says that @entity7 's voting record as a senator was more to the left than the @entity210 's sole socialist , @entity211 of @entity212			1
he says @entity7 's association with radicals and his pledge to " spread the wealth " seal his socialistic credentials			1
" the role of government is to provide a safe environment to conduct business , not to take from one and give to the other , " says @entity204 , a financial planner who lives in @entity218 , @entity219			0
@entity204 was not persuaded by the arguments of other socialist leaders who reject the idea that @entity7 is a socialist			1
" he 's just not socialist enough for them			0
" @entity204 says he does n't like socialism because it breeds mediocrity and encourages people to " live on the dole			2
" capitalism " breeds excellence " because it encourages initiative , he says			0
does that mean that @entity204 will refuse his @entity60 checks , a government program that has been described as socialistic , and which he opposes ? not necessarily , says @entity204			0
he says he 'll accept his @entity60 checks for two reasons			0
" they confiscated it from me to begin with , and the more money they give me , the less they 'll have to waste , " he says			0
" i can spend it better than they can			0
i do n't pay $ 500 for a hammer			0
" the argument over @entity7 's ideology may rage on , but at least one socialist says another prominent politician ought to be inserted into the debate			1
@entity137 , the national director of the @entity138 , says he was struck by one player in the 2008 presidential elections who displayed more socialistic leanings than @entity7			2
this candidate raised taxes on the big oil companies , and sent the revenue to the people			0
if you want to learn something about spreading the wealth , @entity137 says , do n't look to @entity7			1
" to be honest , the most socialist candidate in the 2008 election was @entity272			0

@entity7 has been called a socialist but what do actual socialists say ?
socialist leader : @entity7 is n't even a liberal
socialists say many @entity26 already accept socialism
@entity201 member : @entity7 wants to spread the wealth
