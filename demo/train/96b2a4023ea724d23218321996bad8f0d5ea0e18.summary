@entity0 -- the imam at the center of an ugly controversy over an @entity4 center near @entity0 's ground zero broke his silence tuesday , just hours after a broad coalition of @entity12 , @entity3 and @entity4 leaders denounced what they described as a rising tide of @entity16 bigotry across the @entity17			1
" i have been struck by how the controversy has riveted the attention of @entity17 , as well as nearly everyone i met in my travels , " said @entity18 in an editorial published online by @entity20 tuesday night			0
read @entity20 editorial " we have all been awed by how inflamed and emotional the issue of the proposed community center has become , " wrote @entity18 , who has just returned from a @entity27 - sponsored @entity26 trip to promote @entity17 - @entity29 relations			1
" the level of attention reflects the degree to which people care about the very @entity17 values under debate : recognition of the rights of others , tolerance and freedom of worship			0
" the imam was clear about his intentions			1
" we are proceeding with the community center , @entity48			1
more important , we are doing so with the support of the downtown community , government at all levels and leaders from across the religious spectrum , who will be our partners			1
i am convinced that it is the right thing to do for many reasons , " he wrote			0
opponents of the plan to build the center say it is too close to the site of the terror attacks and is an affront to the memory of those who died in the @entity69 strike			1
backers cite , among other things , first amendment rights and the need to express religious tolerance			0
@entity18 described the center to be built two blocks from the former site of the @entity79 towers -- destroyed by terrorist - hijacked commercial jets on september 11 , 2001 -- as a " shared space for community activities , like a swimming pool , classrooms and a play space for children			1
" " there will be separate prayer spaces for @entity29 , @entity12 , @entity3 and men and women of other faiths , " he wrote			0
" the center will also include a multifaith memorial dedicated to victims of the sept. 11 attacks			2
" " i am very sensitive to the feelings of the families of victims of 9/11 , as are my fellow leaders of many faiths			2
we will accordingly seek the support of those families , and the support of our vibrant neighborhood , as we consider the ultimate plans for the community center			2
our objective has always been to make this a center for unification and healing			2
" @entity0 mayor @entity112 spoke on tuesday about the plan and criticized politicians he claims are using the issue for political gain ahead of midterm elections in november			1
" this is a political thing that all came up in two months -- and it 's going to go away on november 4th , " he said			2
various faith leaders in recent weeks have expressed concerns about hate crimes against @entity124 in the run - up to this weekend 's anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , which coincide with the holiday of @entity129 , marking the conclusion of the @entity29 holy month of @entity132			1
worry over what some observers have termed " @entity144 " has also been heightened by a @entity142 , @entity143 , church 's plan to burn copies of the @entity138 on saturday , the ninth anniversary of the attacks on @entity0 and @entity141			1
earlier tuesday , a broad coalition of faith leaders gathered in @entity141 , where they met with attorney general @entity148 to discuss their concerns			1
" to quote the attorney general , he called the @entity142 planned burning of @entity154 ' idiotic and dangerous , ' " said @entity152 , president of @entity153 , soon after meeting with @entity148			1
" while it may not be a violation of the law -- it may be an act of free speech -- it certainly violates our sense of decency , " she added about the @entity143 event			1
@entity17 secretary of state @entity163 echoed those thoughts later when she spoke at a dinner celebration of @entity166 , the breaking the daily fast during @entity132			1
" i am heartened by the clear , unequivocal condemnation of this disrespectful , disgraceful act that has come from @entity17 religious leaders of all faiths ... as well as secular @entity17 leaders and opinion makers , " she said			1
separately , founders of the newly formed @entity174 addressed the issue of religious freedom during a news conference at @entity141 's @entity178			2
" freedom of religion is a hallmark of this country , " said @entity179 , head of the @entity180			0
it is time to decide " whether we are going to live up to our values			0
" the coalition released a statement decrying a " disturbing rise in discrimination against @entity29 " and declaring that the current " level of hostility , fear mongering and hate speech is unacceptable and un-american			0
" " we believe the best way to uphold @entity17 's democratic values is to ensure that @entity29 can exercise the same religious freedom enjoyed by everyone in @entity17 , " the statement read			2
last week , the @entity198 launched a series of commercials designed to fight what it called growing @entity144			0
one in the series features a @entity29 firefighter who was among the first responders on 9/11			0
opponents of the @entity0 islamic center are " trying to tell the world and tell @entity17 that @entity29 do not belong here			1
that @entity29 are the others , when we are in fact , all @entity17 , " said @entity209 , executive director of the council			0
" they 're trying to portray @entity29 as foreigners			0
this is a dangerous repeat of history			0
if it 's allowed , it 's going to hurt all of us , " he said			2
in a statement on its website , the @entity219 in @entity142 , @entity143 , said it plans to mark the anniversary of the 2001 attacks by burning qurans this weekend " to warn about the teaching and ideology of @entity227 , which we do hate as it is hateful			1
" the pastor of the small church , @entity231 , has written a book titled " @entity227 is of the @entity233 , " and the church sells coffee mugs and shirts featuring the phrase			2
the @entity17 commander in @entity239 on monday criticized the church 's plan , warning the demonstration " could cause significant problems " for @entity17 troops overseas			1
" it could endanger troops and it could endanger the overall effort in @entity239 , " gen. @entity245 said			0
@entity231 told @entity1 's " @entity248 " on tuesday that he is " taking the general 's words " seriously			0
we are " weighing the situation " and are " praying about it , " he said			0
but it is " very important that @entity17 wakes up , " he argued			0
@entity227 " must be shown a certain amount of force ( and ) determination			0
" the planned event has drawn criticism from @entity29 in the @entity17 and overseas , with thousands of @entity260 gathering outside the @entity261 in @entity262 , @entity260 , on sunday to protest the planned @entity138 burning			1
" those mainly conservative @entity12 who respond to their @entity29 brothers and sisters -- their fellow @entity17 -- with @entity16 bigotry or hatred , they are openly rejecting ... the @entity271 principles of religious liberty which we as evangelical @entity12 benefit daily , " said rev. @entity264 , of the @entity265 , at the @entity178			0
" and to those who would exercise derision ... bigotry ( and ) open rejection of our fellow @entity17 for their religious faith -- i say shame on you			0
