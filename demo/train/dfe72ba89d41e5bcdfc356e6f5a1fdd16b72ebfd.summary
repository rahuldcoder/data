-- @entity2 's relentless focus on crisis tends to cloud its ability to see great opportunities			0
with more than 40 @entity7 heads of state coming to @entity2 this week for three days of meetings with president @entity10 , @entity12 officials , members of @entity14 and @entity6 business leaders , the @entity6 has a real opportunity to jump - start what has been a slow evolution in the way we have engaged with @entity22			1
it 's an opportunity that should not be missed			0
foreign assistance is no longer @entity6 's primary export to @entity22 , and our engagement needs to change , too			2
the @entity6 - @entity28 is an opportunity to showcase and strengthen a relationship that is evolving dramatically on economic , security and development fronts			2
this will be the @entity6 ' first @entity7 heads - of - state summit , which puts us well behind our global competitors			1
@entity38 , which surpassed the @entity6 as @entity22 's largest trading partner five years ago , has held five summits with @entity7 heads of state since 2000			1
the @entity38 have seen plainly what many @entity6 businesses have not : that six of the world 's 10 fastest - growing economies over the past decade were in @entity22			1
since 2000 , @entity38 exports to @entity22 have outpaced @entity6 exports at a ratio of 3 to 1 , and @entity38 is now @entity22 's largest trading partner			1
when @entity38 wants something from an @entity7 government -- mining rights or port exclusivity , for example -- it offers no - strings - attached " gifts " or investments in infrastructure			2
while the @entity6 offers values - driven policy and investments in people , especially in public health , the @entity38 have a reputation for paying for the friendship of @entity7 governments with low - interest financing of construction projects			1
@entity6 foreign direct investment in @entity22 still outstrips the @entity38 , but in trade and export sales to @entity22 , the @entity38 have eclipsed us			1
for the @entity6 to continue competing , our relationship with @entity7 governments and businesses must evolve to include more meaningful and mutually beneficial partnerships			2
the summit 's business forum on tuesday will put @entity6 ceos at the table with @entity7 heads of state and business leaders			1
this is matchmaking , with an eye on increasing @entity6 exports to @entity22 's rapidly growing middle - class consumer base			1
opinion : what @entity10 can do about @entity89 @entity6 ceos want new markets for their products , and @entity6 workers want jobs making those products			0
@entity7 leaders want more international companies to sell their products in their countries , invest in their growth and partner with local businesses			0
the opportunity for increased trade and investment is extraordinary and important for the evolution of the @entity6 ' relationship with the continent			0
we can and should exercise our unique competitive advantages			0
the @entity6 boasts an @entity7 diaspora drawn here by @entity6 universities and steeped in @entity6 culture and entrepreneurship , and a level of technology , innovation and quality that still commands the attention of @entity7 leaders , consumers and countries			1
the @entity6 has a unique opportunity to build bridges to emerging economies and democracies in @entity22 through the tens of thousands of @entity7 in our country who are a part of the diaspora			1
engineers and businessmen , educated here and successful here , can connect the @entity6 to @entity22 in ways @entity38 , @entity135 and @entity136 simply can not			1
after 50 years of president @entity138 's @entity137 , a decade of president @entity140 's transformational campaign to prevent and treat @entity141 , and with the promise of president @entity10 's @entity144 electrification initiative , the @entity6 is better regarded in @entity22 than anywhere in the world			1
i saw this firsthand as a student in @entity151 in 1984 and have experienced it consistently in visits since			0
we should build on the positive view of @entity6 and @entity6 created by the remarkable generosity of our investments in health , education , clean water and good governance to shift our engagement strategy from aid to trade			0
@entity38 , @entity135 , @entity164 and @entity136 are focused on the huge potential of @entity22 because of the increase in the number of stable and growing countries on the continent			2
while the bad news from a handful of countries dominates @entity6 news , the quietly good news about growth and opportunity in dozens of others is overlooked			0
to its credit , the @entity10 administration has noticed			0
delegations led earlier this year by the secretaries of commerce and energy , the president 's remarkable @entity180 , and the administration 's @entity144 are all meaningful steps forward			0
@entity14 can do its part by strengthening and reauthorizing the @entity189 before its authorization expires next year			0
the real success of @entity10 's summit wo n't come in the form of a joint press statement or vague declaration of a path forward but in new contracts between @entity6 companies with @entity7 partners and new commitments from @entity7 leaders			1
twenty years ago , every @entity6 company was deciding whether to take the risk of investing in and engaging in the newly opening markets of @entity205 , and @entity38 ended up being the dominant opportunity of the region			2
today , no competitive company is without some role in @entity38			0
@entity22 will emerge as the next great growth market and opportunity of the 21st century , and @entity38 will not miss " the next @entity38			2
" @entity6 should n't either			0
join us on @entity214 / @entity213 .			0

more than 40 heads of state attend first @entity22 summit in the @entity6 this week
sen. @entity219 : this is opportunity for @entity6 business to create ties to fast - growing @entity22
@entity38 surpassed the @entity6 in trade with @entity22 , but @entity6 has *distinct* advantages , he says
@entity219 : the @entity6 has @entity7 diaspora that succeeded here , and it 's well - regarded in @entity22
