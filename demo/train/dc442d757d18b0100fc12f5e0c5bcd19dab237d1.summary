@entity2 , @entity3 as snow layered the trail before him , @entity0 thought it was odd			2
the veteran trekking guide had never seen snow on the trail in early october			2
the popular 21 - day @entity7 takes trekkers in a horseshoe - shaped route around a majestic segment of the @entity11 in @entity3			1
on the 10th day of the tour , @entity0 and his clients , two young @entity14 women , were descending from the highest point of the trail , @entity18 , to the next destination , a walk that would normally take about seven hours			2
now , after more than 10 hours of heading downhill , the snow pelted			2
the flurry fell heavier and faster , obstructing their vision			2
there was nowhere to stop or rest ; they had to keep walking			2
" you could n't see the trail , there was snow everywhere , making it easy to get lost , " said @entity0			2
" it was all white , in the distance you could only see shadows of people walking			2
" some wandered off the trail			2
as the blizzard continued , their feet sunk into the snow pile			2
as their steps became heavier , they began to cry			2
as the hours passed , @entity0 could make out backpacks and supplies strewn on the snow			2
" there were people who had fallen , or were stuck or resting along the way			2
i could n't tell if i saw a dead body			2
" conditions in the @entity11 can be cruel			1
but trekkers dying in snowstorms on the @entity7 is almost unheard of -- until this year			2
deadly year @entity3 , known for its fabled @entity11 including @entity54 , has endured a deadly , tragic year			1
in april , a hanging glacial mass collapsed and tumbled through a dangerous route on @entity54 , killing 16 @entity57 in the worst single disaster			2
months later , an unseasonal snowstorm struck @entity60 , killing at least 43 people including locals and foreign tourists			2
were the disasters just prone to happen or was climate change a factor ? @entity54 mountaineers have spoken of changes they 've witnessed for years			1
" in my first journey , there was snow and ice , " said @entity69 , a retired mountaineer who made his first summit in 1990			1
" now we can see more rock			0
it 's more dangerous ... the glacier 's melting , the ice is falling , there 's rocks falling more			0
" after a record 21 summits of @entity54 , he has no doubt that conditions are changing rapidly			0
dawa @entity86 , who has been climbing @entity54 since 2006 , agreed : " our observations show that seracs are peeling off the mountains much quicker and we 're seeing avalanches much more frequently and of greater magnitude			1
" whether the deadly disasters in @entity3 this year can be linked to climate change is debatable			1
" i am leery of attributing everything bad in nature to climate change , " said @entity95 , senior associate research scientist at the @entity96 who studies the @entity11			1
" sorting out what 's specifically due to climate change and what 's not is a difficult and sometimes impossible task			1
that said , it 's clear climate is changing all over the world , including in @entity3			1
" while it 's difficult to blame any single incident on climate change , there 's evidence of an increasingly warming @entity11			1
temperatures in the central @entity11 increased by about 0.6 degrees @entity114 per decade between 1977 and 2000 , according to one study			1
in the @entity118 , the average temperature in @entity117 rose by 1.35 degrees celsius in 30 years , according to a report by @entity120			1
the impact of climate change includes accelerated glacial melt , irregular rainfall , changes in the monsoon season and greater risk of catastrophes such as avalanches , landslides and floods			1
natural disasters always happen , regardless of climate change , experts say			1
what 's worrisome is that disasters in the @entity11 are becoming more common			1
extreme flooding hit @entity138 in 2012 and landslides and flooding washed away streets and killed hundreds in 2013 at a @entity11 holy site in @entity143 , @entity144			1
unusually early and heavy monsoon rains triggered that disaster , in which two months of rain poured in two days			0
" these extreme rare events , they 're not rare anymore , " @entity95 said			0
water towers of @entity152 the @entity11 stretch from the eastern corner of @entity154 , through @entity3 to the northern tip of @entity156			1
they contain snow packs and glaciers with freshwater that feed 10 major @entity152 rivers , including the @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 , giving life to the continent 's farms			0
disruptions to the @entity11 could affect agriculture , as well as water and food security for @entity152 countries including the two most populous countries in the world -- @entity144 and @entity176			1
@entity3 sits sandwiched between these two countries , which are among the world 's biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions			0
but @entity3 emits 0.025 % of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions , according to estimates			0
" we have not swallowed poison , yet we are being poisoned , " said dr. @entity184 , vice chairman of the @entity3 's planning commission			0
" we have n't done anything against nature or contributed to climate change , but we are majorly affected			1
" farmers at risk in @entity3 , climate change is already impacting lives and livelihood , scientists say			1
" climate change is making things worse , " said @entity197 , senior program officer for integrated climate risk management at the @entity199			1
" there are lots of dry spurts , interspersed with heavy rain in a short period of time that 's causing flooding			0
" farmers say that pests they 've never seen before are eating their crops			0
the monsoon rains they 've traditionally expected to arrive in june have become inconsistent , many say			0
" we depend on timely rainfall for crop cultivation , " said @entity214 , a farmer who lives in a small village near the foot of the @entity11			1
" we may not be able to feed ourselves or have the proper yield			0
the rain is either too late , too little or too much			0
" it was n't like this before , they say			0
@entity3 's mountains are encircled with terrace farms where families have tilled the soil for generations			0
more than 70 % of @entity229 work in agriculture and most are subsistence farmers			0
many farmers , like @entity234 , have seen landslides and floods destroy their livelihoods			1
he woke up several years ago to his house trembling as a flood swept over his farmland			1
" the river beating the stones made drumming sounds that kept growing			1
i heard the sound of the boulders rolling with the water			0
it felt like an earthquake , " said @entity234 , who lost his farm in @entity2 , near the @entity11			1
@entity2 is identified as one of the most vulnerable districts to landslides according to a national study on climate change conducted by the @entity3 government			1
the farmers say their livelihood is becoming harder and they do n't know why			0
" the people that are hit the hardest are not the ones causing the climate change , " said @entity259 , director general of the @entity260 - based @entity120			1
" that 's the important message			0
the poorest people in the world are emitting the least amount of carbon , ( yet ) they 're the ones who have to adapt dramatically to these changes			0
" in harms way one of the issues is that some villages and homes are cropping up too close to a river or in dangerous areas prone to landslides or floods			1
" people who are building are unaware that they 're in dire jeopardy , " @entity95 said			0
" right now , there 's uncontrolled growth , in very vulnerable places , with houses sitting on river bluffs			0
" the mountains have always carried risk of landslides , avalanches and snowstorms even without climate change			1
but new developments in vulnerable areas exacerbate the risks of making them casualty events			0
" the @entity11 are changing , the way people are living in the @entity11 is changing too , " said @entity259			1
" people are living closer to the river , there are more trekkers and mountain climbers			1
" as @entity54 has become more commercial , the number of expeditions has increased			0
in 2013 , 658 climbers summited the peak , compared with 192 two decades ago			0
about 20,000 people a year now trek around the @entity311			0
more people climbing and trekking means a greater probability of disasters that impact tourists and local hires			1
" people were not prepared " it 's riskier for local hires , like @entity0 , who are exposed to greater risks because of repeated trips			1
" why would you want to go to the mountains ? i only do it because i need to survive and i need the money , " he said			0
the only opportunities for uneducated , landless men are to take a construction job in the @entity332 or work in tourism , said @entity0 , a lanky man with a wiry frame			0
he has to support his wife and two kids			0
during the blizzard , he guided his two clients to safety after 12 hours			0
while dozens died , went missing or had their hands blackened from frostbite , he and his two @entity14 hikers survived without injuries			0
for a day 's work of carrying 50 pounds of gear and guiding tourists , he earns $ 10			0
the @entity60 snowstorm was the effect of @entity350 , which lashed @entity144 and wound up north in @entity3 in october			0
hundreds of tourists and local hires were stranded when the storms hit			0
" people were not prepared , they did n't get the warning signals , like they should have , " said @entity259			0
while the @entity60 event can not be definitively ruled as a climate change - related disaster , it ca n't be ruled out either , scientists say			1
" the speculation to the link to climate change is we 're getting more intense rainfall or precipitation , " said @entity259			1
" it 's so hard to say that event was due to climate change			1
all of these things have a relation			0
to prove that would be difficult			1
" @entity0 attributes his survival to the rings of ice that formed around his ankles , which blocked snow from seeping into his bright orange @entity378 , saving his feet from frostbite			0
just three days later , @entity0 laced the same sneakers and headed back to the mountains to guide another group , glancing upward to the clouds that , for him and others , were becoming increasingly difficult to decipher			2
this story was made possible by a reporting grant from the @entity389			2
a second part about solutions will run in 2015			0
journalist @entity392 also contributed to this report .			0

recent deadly mountain incidents in @entity11 have created concern about climate change
avalanches are more frequent and of greater magnitude , says @entity69
landslides and floods have made farming more difficult in recent years
