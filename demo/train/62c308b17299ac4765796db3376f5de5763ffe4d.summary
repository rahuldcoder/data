@entity0 , @entity1 -- several times a week , a 74 - year - old grandmother drives into the murder capital of the world to help keep a sanctuary for its citizens alive			1
@entity8 insists on returning to her hometown to preserve the @entity10 , a health center she started more than 30 years ago			1
" it 's very , very important to keep that place open , giving good services " to the people of @entity0 , @entity13 says			1
" because it 's their hope			2
" but her journey from @entity22 , @entity23 , to @entity0 has seared some painful images into her mind			1
" we were going under a bridge and there was a body upside down without a head , hanging there with all the blood flowing , " she recalls			0
" it was something like a horror movie			0
" such sights have become increasingly common in @entity0 , as @entity1 's drug war has intensified			1
nearly 2,000 people have been killed so far this year , including 34 members of the municipal police			2
that 's on top of the 2,623 deaths last year and 1,908 deaths in 2007 - 08			2
despite the violence , @entity13 's hospital and its staff -- which treats about 900 patients daily , regardless of their ability to pay -- have remained unharmed			1
" our hospital has not been touched			2
our doctors have not been kidnapped			0
this is a miracle of @entity55 , believe me , " she says			0
" everybody knows that [ it 's a ] safe place for healing , for loving , for empowering people			1
why would they be against that ? we have been working there for 37 years with the community , " she says			2
" we do n't turn anybody away			2
" @entity13 , who is married to a prominent businessman from @entity0 , lived there for decades , but the escalating violence , murder , crime and corruption recently forced her to move to @entity22			1
she says the tipping point came when her family was threatened			0
" they called and they said that they had kidnapped my daughter			0
they wanted us to send the money , but my daughter came into the room while we were talking to them			0
more than anything i wanted to protect my three children , " she says			0
@entity13 says she has lost friends and neighbors in the conflict , but she insists she 's not afraid -- and she 's determined to help the people of @entity0 continue receiving the medical care they need			1
@entity13 has always been passionate about health care , volunteering with the @entity92 when she was 8 years old			1
she became an advocate for maternal and infant health in the early 1970s after reading a newspaper article about an impoverished mother of nine , pregnant with her 10th child , who tried to kill her fetus by stabbing herself in the stomach			0
@entity13 went to visit the woman in jail and asked her why she did not practice family planning			1
shocked to learn the woman lacked the most basic knowledge about preventing pregnancy , @entity13 helped her obtain legal counsel and began a quest to educate other women			1
she partnered with community health volunteers called " promotoras " in villages across @entity1 to help educate women about family planning and support maternal and infant health			1
" we want the baby to have a good beginning in life			0
from there , you can do everything else , " she says			0
one of @entity13 's first clinics was built in the early ' 70s where the @entity10 sits today			1
it was just a few rooms and was not equipped for delivering babies			0
but when @entity13 opened the doors to a desperate woman in labor , it started a decades - long expansion process that recently resulted in the birth of the facility 's 100,000th baby			1
the hospital does far more than deliver babies			2
with a staff of 144 doctors and 192 nurses , @entity10 performs emergency care as well as routine and specialized surgeries for adults and children			0
six months ago , specialists were brought in to perform the hospital 's first successful heart surgery			1
and @entity13 is always looking for ways to provide more services to the community			2
" every year is a little bit bigger and a little bit better , " she says			0
" we want the poorest people to have the best care because they need it and they deserve it			2
" although the @entity10 does charge patients who are able to pay , it does not currently make a profit -- though it hopes to be sustainable one day			0
for now , the hospital is funded entirely by a nonprofit organization called @entity160 that was founded by @entity13			1
the @entity10 is just one of the organization 's many health care facilities			2
in addition to seven hospitals and 32 @entity168 clinics across @entity1 , the organization also started a microfinancing program and nursing school			1
for @entity13 , who frequently visits patients and is active in administrative , operational and financial aspects at the hospital , her work not only saves lives but has given meaning to her own life as well			1
" i just love it			0
because it 's my life , it 's my passion			0
i get the privilege of experiencing the magic moment of change from sickness to health , from darkness to light , from apathy to enthusiasm			0
this is what gives me meaning to my life			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity193 website at www.femap.org and see how to help .			0

@entity8 opened a hospital in @entity0 , @entity1 , 30 years ago
with violence *plaguing* the *streets* of @entity0 , the hospital is more important now than ever
@entity13 's nonprofit organization ensures people are treated even if they ca n't pay
@entity13 , 74 , lives in @entity22 , @entity23 , but still travels to @entity0 several times a week
