-- it turns out sunscreen does more than protect you from cancer and painful sunburns -- it offers a boost to simple vanity			2
a new study finds that regular sunscreen use protects against photoaging : the wrinkling , spotting and loss of elasticity caused by exposure to the sun 's ultraviolet radiation			1
while they may not be shocking , the findings -- from @entity19 researchers -- are the first to quantify sunscreen 's anti-aging properties			1
more than 900 participants were followed for four years			0
some were told to use sunscreen daily and instructed in proper use , including re-applying sunscreen after being outside for a few hours , after going in the water or after sweating heavily			2
other participants were given no directions with regard to using sunscreen -- it was considered unethical to ask them to not use it			2
skin changes were measured through a technique called microtopography , in which researchers made sensitive silicone impressions of the back of each participant 's hand			1
chronic sun exposure damages trucker 's skin through glass " skin surface patterns reflect the severity of the sun 's damage to the deeper skin , especially to the elastic fibers and collagen , " says dr. @entity44 , the study 's lead author			1
damage was measured on a scale from 1 to 6 , with 1 signifying no damage and 6 meaning skin with severe aging			1
participants were given a score at the start of a four - year period and another score at the end ; those who used sunscreen daily were 24 % less likely to show increased signs of aging , researchers found			1
" we now have the scientific evidence to back the long - held assumption about the cosmetic value of sunscreen , " says @entity67			2
" regular sunscreen use by young and mid-aged adults under 55 brings cosmetic benefits and also decreases the risk of skin cancer			1
" the sun does damage with different types of radiation , according to dr. @entity80 , a professor of dermatology at the @entity82			1
uv - b radiation is the primary cause of most skin cancers and is also the main cause of sunburns			2
@entity88 is mostly caused by uv - a radiation , which robs the skin of its natural ability to hold its shape and also causes freckles and so - called liver spots			1
" your skin tries to protect itself , and makes all this splotchy pigment , " says @entity80			0
" it 's the body 's response trying to protect itself from that bombardment			0
" what to look for when buying sunscreen the new report , published in the @entity105 , is part of a research project that has stretched for more than two decades , led by @entity67 and colleagues at the @entity109			0
the measurements were taken between 1992 and 1996 , and patients used older types of sunscreens			0
in theory , says @entity80 , modern sunscreens should be even more effective			0
" back in the ' 90s , we did n't have many good uv - a sunscreens , " he says			0
" now , we have broad - spectrum sunscreens that block both uv - a and uv - b rays , although none of them block all the @entity119 " video : the best sunscreens are n't necessarily the most expensive while sunscreens have improved , @entity80 cautions that they are no replacement for limiting total exposure , and avoiding intense sun during the middle part of the day			0
he also notes that photoaging is not part of the natural aging process -- it 's avoidable			1
" if you see a 90 - year - old person , and look at a part of their body that has not been exposed to the sun , you do n't see any photoaging , " he says			1
anyone who spends time outdoors during daylight hours should use sunscreen , even if they have darker skin pigment and tan easily , the @entity82 advises			1
children are especially susceptible to the sun 's harmful effects			2
babies under the age of 6 months should be kept out of direct sunlight because their skin is so fragile			0
a word about @entity154 : it 's not an indication of how much time you should spend in the sun. an spf of 30 does not mean you can stay out twice as long as an @entity154 of 15 , the clinic says			0
an @entity154 of 15 filters out about 93 % of uv - b rays , compared to 97 % for @entity154			0
last year , the @entity163 said it had found 25 % of 800 tested sunscreens were effective without containing harmful ingredients			0
to make the watchdog group 's safe list , sunscreens had to be free of oxybenzone , retinyl palmitate ( a type of vitamin a ) , not have an @entity154 above 50 and protect against uv - a and uv - b rays .			0

@entity88 is skin wrinkling , spotting and loss of elasticity caused by sun damage
