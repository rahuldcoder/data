-- @entity1 in @entity2 are responding with shock and outrage after a pig carcass and severed swine heads were discovered buried at the site of a proposed mosque			1
police in the town of @entity11 uncovered the pigs friday after they received an anonymous message claiming that someone had buried the body parts and spilled 120 liters of blood from the animals in an effort to desecrate the ground to halt the construction of the mosque			1
pork and pork byproducts are haram , or forbidden , in @entity24			0
the unsigned flier , written in @entity26 , says " this operation was done ( conducted ) to protest against the growing expansion of @entity24 in @entity2 , " and says that a similar desecration in @entity28 earlier halted another mosque construction project			1
@entity32 , chief of the @entity34 police , told @entity0 by phone that there were no suspects currently , but that a full investigation is under way			0
" we ca n't say yet it is a hate crime in those words , but it could have been done to stop the mosque , " said @entity32			1
@entity32 said that whoever is responsible may be brought up on environmental pollution charges			0
the police chief says that veterinary health officials have been called in to find if pig 's blood has in fact been spilled , and that charges may be filed over illegal dumping of animal parts in addition to other potential criminal charges			2
but for @entity1 in @entity2 , it 's just the latest sign that they are being victimized by some in the far right			2
@entity60 , spokesman for @entity2 's @entity61 said the deed " crossed a line " that had already been pushed against @entity1 since a popular referendum in 2009 banned the construction of new minarets			2
" since the ban on minarets there 's been an increase in @entity71 and islamophobic events , so it was not really surprising " said @entity60			0
" but it is an escalation in @entity2 because this is a peaceful country where @entity78 and @entity1 have all been living together ... and we are a bit afraid this may increase			1
" there are an estimated 500,000 @entity1 in @entity2 , out of a population of more than 7 million says @entity60 , who admitted that the population is rising but that most @entity1 were immigrants from @entity85 and elsewhere in the @entity86 , where there is a tradition of moderate @entity24			1
the property had been purchased by the local @entity91 community several years ago from a @entity2 far right political activist			0
the man claimed that he had not been informed that it would be used for a mosque and had fought the sale in court , before ultimately losing his civil case recently allowing construction to go forward			0
" we can just wait for the next rain or snowfall to cleanse the ground , so we do not fear from this side anything , " said @entity60			0
" but on the other hand it 's an emotional thing , it means that there are actually people in this society who deny the right of @entity1 when it comes to a mosque in @entity2 and this is something that hurts us			2
