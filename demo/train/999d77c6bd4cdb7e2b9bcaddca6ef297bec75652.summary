-- the world is undergoing a mobility transformation			2
since @entity4 launched the first @entity5 in 2007 , more than 100 billion apps have been downloaded from app stores by consumers worldwide			0
@entity8 , the market research firm , has predicted that by 2015 , tablet sales will be higher than those of pcs and laptops combined			1
there are now more connected mobile devices on earth than there are people			1
this transformation is happening much faster than the dot - com revolution of the late 1990s , and businesses are catching on			1
companies are already developing 20 to 30 apps on average in the three categories of consumer , business - to - business and ( @entity28 ) and enterprise			0
these are already changing the way we live and work , wherever we are			0
additionally , they are changing the way businesses interact with other businesses , investors , media , customers and even their own workforce worldwide			1
despite this , @entity8 estimates that 60 % of the @entity42 companies will not have a mobile strategy in place by 2014			1
in my view , having a mobile strategy is not enough for businesses to succeed globally in the years to come			1
what businesses need is a " mobile first " strategy , placing mobile opportunities at the forefront of their international growth			1
do n't forget consumer apps personal media technology is already streamlining the way we deal with our daily tasks -- both in business and at home			0
@entity64 offers mobile applications that allow customers to manage their accounts on the move , improving the service as well as reducing call centre waiting times			1
through similar technology , reading the economist has never been more enjoyable ( or widespread -- as the mobile and tablet apps have been downloaded six million times )			1
the average @entity78 family now has ten internet connected devices			0
the fact is that if consumers ca n't access your brand on multiple platforms , they will switch to one where they can			0
creating effective mobile software is not easy			1
it requires solid software development and user interface design , not to mention thorough testing			0
this is perhaps why , while some 60 % of organizations have consumer apps , their quality does not score high among consumers			1
it is not enough for the apps to be useful , people have to enjoy using them			0
user experience -- how an application feels -- is paramount			0
for ten years , @entity104 has been working with customers who understand that user experience is about combining design and software skills with a deep knowledge of how back end systems operate			0
in the global market , good user interface must include the insightful localization , both in terms of language and content			1
these are the hallmarks of the most successful global consumer apps and when companies get them right , they build better relationships and channels of information for their customers in all countries			1
enterprise apps for a global workforce in the global work market , bring your own device policies are on the rise -- allowing employees to bring personally owned mobile devices to their workplace			1
companies are therefore increasingly required to create apps for their staff -- and these need to be just as good as the consumer ones			0
@entity8 expects 80 % of businesses to support a workforce using tablets by 2014			1
company leaders want mobile technology to increase productivity			2
in order to achieve this , it must be realized that the best apps are not always the ones that seek to bring the entire business to the smartphone or tablet , but the ones that are created to do a few things very well			2
the @entity157 at @entity104 has recently received a patent for its quantum encryption mobile technology @entity160			2
it is our firm belief that this technology will transform how organizations and individuals can keep our mobile data safe on personal technology devices , with countless benefits to companies and organizations in global business			1
all about @entity28 apps mobile apps present new and exciting opportunities for businesses to communicate with other businesses			1
some @entity28 companies have succeeded by using apps that support the sales process			2
for instance , creating presentations using an @entity182 allows for a more personal and engaging experience			0
other companies have built deeper and more personal relationships with investors and journalists through apps -- regardless of geographical boundaries			0
the prime example here is @entity193 , whose award - winning @entity194 and @entity197 apps benefit from innovative features and platform - specific functionality			0
at the same time , they keep the user experience consistent , making sure to deliver the most relevant content			0
@entity104 's delivery of the @entity193 investor relations app led to a two-fold increase in dwell time and a 300 per cent increase in downloads			0
these are the kinds of rewards global companies can not afford to miss out on			2
future concerns : the internet of things the mobility transformation has already given birth to another revolution : the @entity218			0
the change that we have witnessed in past years is only going to accelerate			0
it is expected that the number connected mobile devices will be five times higher than it is now by 2020			2
this will inevitably change the face of how companies deal with their global customer base			2
to succeed , companies must seize the opportunities they have to transform their businesses accordingly , to build more rewarding relationships and more productive workforces globally through the impact of personal media			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

tablet sales are predicted to *surpass* pcs , laptops by 2015 , says @entity8
yet 60 % of businesses will not have a mobile strategy in place by 2014
firms must have ' mobile first ' strategy if they wish to go global , writes @entity237
