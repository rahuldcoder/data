@entity0 -- conservative commentator @entity2 says his weekend revival - style rally at the @entity4 was meant to reclaim the @entity6 civil rights movement " from politics , " arguing that the movement was about " people of faith			1
" @entity2 told @entity11 , the network that carries his weekday television program , that the essence of the movement was about " people of faith who believe you have an equal right to justice			1
" " if it 's not the essence , then we 've been sold a pack of lies			2
the essence is that everyone deserves a shot -- the content of character not the color of skin , " he told " @entity30			0
" @entity2 drew a crowd that stretched six blocks down the @entity34 on saturday , but drew fire for its timing and location -- the same date and location as the 1963 march on @entity0 , where the rev. @entity40 delivered his famous " @entity42 " speech			1
see the view from the crowd handbills promoting the @entity47 - headlined event called it rally " for jobs and freedom , " with marchers demanding not only voting rights for african - americans but " full and fair employment " and a " decent housing			2
" @entity2 told @entity11 that the civil rights movement 's economic agenda was " a part of it , but that 's a part of it that i do n't agree with			1
" @entity2 has come under fire from civil rights leaders and other critics because of the timing of the rally and some of his previous statements , such as his 2009 that president @entity70 " has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture			1
" and earlier this year , he urged viewers to quit churches that preached " social justice , " a term he equated with socialism			0
in his @entity11 interview , taped after saturday 's rally , he said he regretted his remarks about @entity70 , but said the first @entity81 - @entity6 president 's worldview was shaped by " @entity82 disguised as religion			2
" @entity2 's address to his " @entity88 " rally , nominally held in support of @entity6 troops , resembled more a revival than a political rally			1
in it , he urged those attending to return @entity6 to the religious values on which he said it was founded			0
" something beyond imagination is happening , " he told participants who packed the @entity34 in @entity0			0
" @entity6 today begins to turn back to @entity98			0
for too long , this country has wandered in darkness			0
" @entity102 officials have stopped giving crowd counts after previous controversies			0
but an estimate commissioned by @entity106 , using aerial photography , put attendance at between 78,000 and 96,000			0
@entity109 reported more than 100,000 , while @entity11 -- and @entity2 -- estimated it at above half a million			1
rallies clog @entity112 system the rev. @entity113 , who led a commemoration of the @entity47 rally 's anniversary saturday at a @entity0 high school , dismissed @entity2 's address as a " motivational speech " that ignored the policies @entity47 promoted			1
" it might be good , but it 's not civil rights , " he told @entity1			1
@entity2 also has tried to organize viewers into a " 9/12 " movement , aimed at restoring a spirit he said @entity6 shared after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on @entity127 and @entity0			1
he told @entity11 that @entity6 " should be looking for people with the right ideas , " but dismissed any ambition for elected office himself			2
" my feeling right now is the country is in trouble			0
and i do n't see a political solution , because i think we 're too divided			2
i think both parties have sold their souls , " he said			0
" and you know , our founders , if you read their speeches and their documents and their letters to each other , when they founded our country , they all said it would happen if the people turned from @entity98			0
" so let 's take them as people who knew what they were talking about , " he added			1
" what do you say we give the whole ' let 's turn back to @entity98 ' thing a try and see what happens ? "			0
