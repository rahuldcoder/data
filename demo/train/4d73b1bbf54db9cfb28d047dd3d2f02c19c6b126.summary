@entity0 -- @entity0 may never be the same now that @entity2 has started a residency in @entity5 's @entity4			1
" @entity2 : @entity10 " debuted at @entity6 this weekend , almost 10 years to the day that @entity2 married a high school friend at a wedding chapel just down the vegas strip			2
her marriage to @entity12 lasted just 55 hours before it was annulled , but @entity2 ' new relationship with @entity0 is planned for at least two years			1
she is reportedly earning $ 300,000 per show -- $ 30 million for the 100 shows through 2015			1
@entity2 dances on a 100 - foot stage , backed by 14 dancers and one of the world 's largest video installations			1
she enters from a spherical cage that descends from above			0
near the end , @entity2 leaps from a giant tree , flying across the stage on a cable			2
while her microphone is live and @entity2 appears to be singing , much of what the audience hears is from pre-recorded tracks of 21 hits from her pop career			1
a live four - piece band plays behind @entity2 , visible on scaffolding at the rear of the stage			1
but evidence that much of it is pre-produced comes when @entity39 appears on video to perform " @entity41 " with @entity2			2
backing tracks for vocals are not new or unexpected , considering that @entity2 is running around the stage for most of the 90 - minute show			1
the 4,600 people attending her opening night friday seemed willing to suspend any disbelief			0
they also mouthed the familiar lyrics to " @entity50 , " " oops i did it again , " " toxic , " " circus , " " @entity53 " and " @entity54 " she includes songs from her just - released album " @entity59			0
" unlike most vegas shows , the theater seats are almost unnecessary			0
the crowd stood through most of the show as if they were in a nightclub dancing to a dj. @entity67 describes the remodeled @entity68 as " part nightclub and part theater			0
" the vip section includes bottle service , tables and a dance floor			0
@entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 were among @entity2 ' celebrity friends in the vip section on opening night			2
tickets to the vip area are in big demand , according to @entity84 , the " @entity87 " host who now covers @entity0 nightlife			1
one vegas business owner is negotiating to buy the front - center vip table for every show , he said			0
@entity2 takes a break after playing the @entity94 show , returning on january 29 to begin three shows a week for the next month			1
shows are scheduled in four - week segments in april and may and again in august and september			0
a younger @entity0 @entity2 ' arrival signals another phase in a trend toward a younger @entity0 that began with nightclubs paying famous @entity102 big dollars to play electronic dance music			1
" the demographic of @entity0 has been sliding in the last two years , much younger and the emphasis now is not so much on gaming , " said @entity84			1
the younger tourists are shopping , eating , drinking and going to nightclubs , he said			2
a fan who was just 6 when @entity112 's first single -- " @entity50 " -- topped the pop charts 15 years ago is now 21 and old enough to fly to @entity0 and party			0
spears , who turned 32 this month , " is the obvious and natural choice " to take advantage of the younger vegas because of her fan following , " @entity84 said			2
" when you look at the landscape of pop stars , pop princesses , pop queens , there 's nobody other than @entity2 who has the depth of a career and the number of albums , " he said			0
" she has a huge repertoire to go to			0
" others will soon follow @entity2 , @entity84 predicted			2
@entity134 made @entity0 hot for older superstars when her @entity137 residency began a decade ago , he said			0
" @entity134 brought in @entity138 ( @entity139 ) , @entity134 brought in @entity140 , @entity134 brought in @entity141 ( @entity141 ) , " he said			0
" who 's @entity2 going to bring in ? " @entity143 , whose first song hit the charts just three years ago , began a mini-residency of headlining eight shows at @entity148 in @entity0 sunday night .			1

@entity2 is reportedly earning $ 30 million for the @entity150 shows through 2015
spears dances on a 100 - foot stage , backed by 14 dancers and large video screens
fans do *n't* seem to mind that @entity2 uses pre-recorded vocal tracks
spears show signals a shift toward younger tourists in @entity0 , @entity84 says
