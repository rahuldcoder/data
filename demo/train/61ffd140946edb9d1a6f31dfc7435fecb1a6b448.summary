it 's three down , two to go for @entity2			2
monday 's gold medal win in the @entity4 , to go with a silver in the super-g and gold in the downhill at this year 's @entity9 , means @entity2 is on the verge of making history			1
should success in the @entity13 and slalom follow then the 31 - year - old will become the first woman to ever win five individual medals at a single @entity18 , with @entity19 of @entity20 in 1999 the only man to have achieved the feat. " i 'm more than halfway , so three is done , missing two more , " @entity2 told @entity23			1
" i hope i can do it , for sure			0
" the @entity27 's latest triumph at @entity28 saw her prevail by 0.22 seconds in an event that combines the downhill and slalom runs , with @entity34 duo @entity33 and @entity35 taking silver and bronze respectively			1
leading after the morning 's downhill section , @entity2 secured the fifth fastest time in the afternoon 's slalom run to finish in a combined time of 2:33.37 to secure gold			1
@entity2 , the @entity42 overall points leader , landed a fourth world title but her first in the @entity4 event -- and she celebrated the success with a cartwheel across the finish area			2
" i 'm totally exhausted , it 's a tough program and late start time for the slalom and it 's also really warm , " @entity2 told the @entity49 's official website			2
" but winning is always amazing and now there 's time to recover and enjoy			0
even though i 'm tired i did my best and i 'm happy with the win			0
" her task had been made easier following the disqualification of @entity59 , who was seen breaking into tears after straddling a gate during her slalom run			0
the @entity63 last week won her first medal at a @entity18 in four years with bronze in the super-g , but thursday 's @entity13 now looks to be her only chance of claiming gold at @entity28 , having also finished fifth in the downhill			1
" just try to forget today as fast as possible and move on to the next race , " @entity70 told @entity71			0
maze will also be readying herself for the @entity13 event , knowing that if she can replicate monday 's form there , as well as in saturday 's slalom , then her place in the record books will be assured .			0
