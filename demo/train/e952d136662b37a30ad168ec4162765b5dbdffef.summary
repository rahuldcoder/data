@entity0 -- even though there 's been little change in gas prices recently , drivers could soon see changes in the look of the pumps they use to fill up			1
the @entity11 administration and the @entity12 announced thursday they intend to phase out the rubber boots on gas pump handles now used to capture harmful gasoline vapors while refueling cars			1
the @entity12 says the vapor - capturing fuel pumps are redundant because more than 70 % of all cars on the road today are equipped with on - board systems that capture the harmful vapors			1
according to the @entity12 , 31,000 affected gas stations in mostly urban areas where smog is a problem will each save $ 3,000 apiece once the ruling is fully implemented			1
" we will remain vigilant when it comes to eliminating regulations that are not necessary or that impose unnecessary burdens on @entity34 's families and businesses , " president @entity11 said in a statement			2
since 1994 , gas stations that did not meet air quality standards have been required to use gas vapor recovery systems			0
the most obvious gas vapor recovery system for drivers is the rubber boot at the end of the fuel pump nozzle that fits directly over the gas tank opening			1
when drivers refuel , gas vapors can escape and contribute to smog and harmful air pollution			2
to combat the release of these vapors , most gas stations have installed special gas pump nozzles that include the rubber boot to block vapors from escaping			1
the @entity12 says the rubber fittings will be phased out as part of the new rule			2
the @entity58 decision is the latest government - wide review of federal regulations			0
the @entity58 said in a statement it hopes thursday 's move will save consumers and businesses almost $ 6 billion in the next five years			0
" by streamlining some rules and eliminating others , " said @entity66 , administrator of the @entity67 , " we can save billions of dollars in unnecessary costs while continuing to protect the health and safety of the @entity34 people			0
" but for drivers , the decision will mean less hassle trying to get the rubber boot to fit over their gas tank opening			0
motorcyclists and some recreational vehicle drivers have long complained that the environment - friendly gas nozzles were incompatible with their vehicles			0
other areas highlighted in the @entity58 's announcement include allowing states to replace traffic signs that were previously federally regulated , changing railroad regulations related to freight train travel , and changing certain regulatory reporting requirements for hospitals and doctors .			0
