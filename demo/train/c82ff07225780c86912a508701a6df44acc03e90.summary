@entity0 -- there 's a lot to like about @entity4			1
he 's funny and personable			2
he 's a great @entity6 success story			1
his 9 - 9 - 9 tax plan may be half - baked , but the concept behind the plan -- replace the corporate income tax with in effect a consumption tax -- has a lot to recommend it			1
( although , the plan has a lot of problems , too			2
) finally , in a political cycle that has seen too many coded racial attacks on president @entity20 and his family , it 's a source of great pride to me to see an @entity24 topping my party 's polls			1
if @entity4 had served as governor of @entity29 , or even mayor of @entity31 , he 'd be a valid and credible candidate for president of the @entity6			1
but here 's the trouble : he has not held those offices or any other executive office at any level of government			1
he did serve on the board of the @entity40 in the 1990s , including two years as chairman -- a distinguished position and an important responsibility , but not one that involves the management of a public agency			0
so what ? so everything ! the president 's most fundamental job is to run the government			1
that job is very , very hard			0
the consequences of a mistake are very , very serious			0
for that reason , @entity6 have historically demanded a record of successful accomplishment in public office from their presidential candidates			1
the current president is an exception to the rule , and -- well -- enough said			0
@entity20 became president despite a negligible record in large part as a reaction against the perceived failures of the @entity69 presidency			0
many voters in 2008 made a calculation like : " @entity20 may never have governed anything			0
but @entity69 was a two - term governor of the country 's second biggest state , and he got us into @entity76 and a terrible recession			1
so maybe experience does n't count			2
maybe what we need is a different style : somebody more cautious than @entity69 , somebody who does n't always go with his gut			0
" you might expect republicans to react similarly against the @entity20 presidency , demanding from their nominee skills that @entity20 lacked : administrative experience , negotiating skill , deep policy knowledge			2
but no. from @entity90 to @entity91 to @entity4 , the @entity84 activist base has again and again fixed its hopes on people who have never held an executive public office -- and who defiantly reject the very idea of expertise			1
meanwhile @entity99 -- the man who saved the @entity100 and who inaugurated the nation 's first universal health insurance program as governor of @entity105 -- ca n't rise above 25 % or so among @entity84			2
and the seemingly most logical alternative to @entity99 -- @entity108 gov. @entity107 -- has collapsed in the polls			0
@entity107 may not be the sharpest pencil in the pack , but he can at least claim experience in government			1
the @entity90 , @entity91 and now @entity4 boomlets reveal a worrying disinclination among some republicans not to value government management very highly			1
these voters assume that if a candidate professes the right values , he or she will make the right decisions			0
@entity123 gave this disregard its classic expression in his " @entity126			0
" " i have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient , for i mean to reduce its size			2
i do not undertake to promote welfare , for i propose to extend freedom			0
my aim is not to pass laws , but to repeal them			0
" but guess what ? repealing laws is just as hard as passing laws			0
a president who wishes to extend freedom must still staff his or her administration with people who can do their jobs			0
and the more you reduce government 's size , the more important that what remains should work well			1
back in 2008 , @entity150 editor @entity149 talked about a @entity84 " competence primary			2
" that year , the @entity84 field was dominated by candidates who could claim some huge success in government : @entity99 ; @entity157 's crime - fighting former mayor @entity156 ; and the very effective three - term governor of @entity159 , @entity160			1
the race was won by @entity162 , the man who had devised and pushed the " surge " strategy that turned around the @entity76 war			0
this time , apparently , the competence primary has been canceled			0
in the depths of the worst economic crisis since the @entity170 , competence is needed more than ever			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : @entity4 is a great @entity6 success story
he says @entity4 's tax plan is off - base but the concept behind it is *admirable*
@entity182 : @entity4 's lack of executive experience in government is a big problem
he says that in today 's economic crisis , competence needed more than ever
