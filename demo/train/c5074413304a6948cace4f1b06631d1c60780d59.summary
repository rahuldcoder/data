-- there is a lot to be said for modesty mixed with self - deprecation when faced with overwhelming odds , but despite his best efforts @entity6 ended up displaying neither of these fine qualities			0
last november , when the president and owner of @entity11 -- an unglamorous , unfancied , mid-table team that had shocked itself by leading the @entity14 league despite never having troubled the upper echelons before -- was asked about the prospects of his team staying the course , he was incredulous to say the least			1
" @entity11 champions ? @entity25 , " scoffed @entity6 , who made his money in the refuse industry , in an interview with @entity14 sports daily newspaper @entity23			1
" if i were at @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , @entity27 , @entity28 or @entity29 , and @entity30 finished as champions , i 'd want to stab myself in the backside with a sausage			2
" what a disgrace that would be ! " last weekend @entity6 's " disgrace " was complete			0
his @entity11 players were crowned champions of @entity14 after a 2 - 1 victory over @entity40 , fending off @entity26 -- now one of the richest teams in the world after being bought out by the @entity44 -- to secure the club 's first ever league title			1
the victory was remarkable for a number of reasons			0
for one , @entity11 had never come close to threatening the dominance enjoyed by the likes of @entity27 , @entity52 or @entity26			1
the last time the club enjoyed any silverware was the @entity14 cup 22 years ago			1
the team was also purchased on a shoestring budget			0
while @entity26 could afford to blow € 40 million ( $ 51.26 million ) on @entity59 playmaker @entity58 and hire @entity61 legend @entity60 , the biggest outlay by @entity11 's former @entity14 under 21 coach @entity63 was € 2 million ( $ 2.56 million ) for defender @entity64			1
" it 's unbelievable , " midfielder @entity65 told @entity0 after the game			0
" i think they will stay here until tomorrow night ! it 's good for us , the fans , the president and the city of @entity11			2
we came from the academy and we win the league with a low earning club			2
" @entity11 's entire budget -- € 33 million ( $ 42.29 million ) -- was less than @entity58 's transfer fee			1
given their title odds of 80 - 1 at the start of the season , with a team of journeyman players , no one gave @entity11 a chance			1
but a 2 - 2 draw with @entity26 -- expected to sweep all before them thanks to the club 's @entity91 money -- at the start of the year changed the complexion of the title race			1
the team 's success -- much like @entity100 football 's other fairytale league success , for @entity101 in @entity102 -- was built not on money but on nurturing young players in the academy , building team spirit and spotting talent and value in footballers previously discarded by everyone else			2
" there is an opportunity ( in @entity14 ) for small , well - run clubs ( to do well ) , " said @entity14 football analyst @entity111 , who explained that @entity14 has had four different champions in four seasons , which gives opportunities to less well off teams			2
" @entity11 have had the same president for decades , invested in youth and have n't spent a lot			0
" take @entity122 , the @entity123 who scored the winning goals against @entity40			0
he had experienced such a disastrous spell at @entity127 that no club in @entity129 wanted to touch him			0
@entity14 - born @entity131 playmaker @entity65 , the outstanding player in this @entity11 side , has been with the team since he was 13 years old			1
striker @entity134 worked his way up through the lower leagues before @entity11 saw him playing for second division tours			0
this season he was the top scorer in the @entity14 league			1
yet despite the incredulity of the president , the team continued to win until -- like in the @entity142 and @entity144 's @entity143 -- the title race came down to the last game of the season			1
but still @entity6 did n't entirely believe			0
he instead offered to have his hair cut in a @entity150 - style mohawk if his team won the title			2
sure enough @entity11 passed the final test and @entity6 celebrated by having a drastic new hair cut : a mohawk sprayed orange and blue , the club 's colors			1
@entity6 is 68 years old			0
" we had to be strong mentally and to stay focus , " striker @entity134 told @entity0			0
" the game was n't easy			0
we stayed in the game and thanks to @entity122 ( @entity165 ) we won			0
everybody made a contribution this season			0
it 's the title for a team , a squad and a region			2
" yet the " impossible , " as @entity6 had claimed , had become possible			0
not only that , the success of @entity11 -- a team described as @entity14 football 's " ugly ducklings " by coach @entity63 -- in one of @entity179 's top leagues gives hope that in the era of big money in football even the smaller teams have a shot at the biggest prizes			1
some think this will be the last time an unfancied team could hope to win the league , given @entity26 's unlimited funds			1
but even @entity26 took notice of the way that @entity11 operated			1
" there were a lot of changes , players and coach			0
it is not easy to shape a team 's identity , " @entity60 told @entity200 of the upheaval at @entity26 since his arrival last year			1
but he was magnanimous in defeat , vowing to follow the blueprint set by the team that shocked @entity14			2
" we must look for continuity			0
there will be no revolution ... @entity11 won the title thanks to a style of football they had been building for years			2

@entity11 win the @entity14 league for the first time in club 's *history*
beat @entity40 2 - 1 to beat second placed @entity26 to the title
no one expected the unfancied club to win ; coach called them his " ugly ducklings "
@entity26 bought by @entity232 investors ; one player worth more than entire @entity11 team
