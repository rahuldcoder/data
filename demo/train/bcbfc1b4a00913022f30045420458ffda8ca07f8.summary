although boats are required by law to keep a 200 - yard distance from the spouting giants , curious orcas will sometimes come very close			1

@entity137 congregate in valleys to give birth , then head into the mountains to keep cool and to feed			0
during summer , bighorn sheep can also be spotted on high mountain slopes , often around rocky outcroppings where they perform the seemingly death - defying feats of scrambling along ledges and cliffs			1
@entity148 , @entity149 it goes without saying that @entity148 offers some of the most impressive wildlife encounters anywhere , but there 's something unique about bison , the park 's largest mammal			1
