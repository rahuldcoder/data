@entity23 president @entity32 said @entity1 ' banking sector was more than five times the size of gdp and the group predicted that the island 's public debt would reach 100 % of gdp in 2020			1

so the big financial institutions like the @entity59 asked for a bailout from the government , and the government came to the @entity63 in june 2012 saying it needed a bailout in turn			2
talks have dragged since then , as @entity1 resisted many of the tough economic measures demanded by potential institutional lenders in return for bailout funds			1
