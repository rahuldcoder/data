-- let me begin by saying that if mr. @entity2 so much as breathes a word about @entity4 , @entity5 or @entity6 , i win this debate			1
seriously , they are @entity9 ( aka @entity10 ) and , thus , completely off limits when speaking of the @entity12			1
you may be thinking , " that 's an unsporting way to begin an argument			2
" well , i 'm in a pretty unsporting mood after my @entity17 -- again -- choked down the backstretch , looking more like a team playing five - @entity20 than one of the greatest sports franchises on @entity23			1
but they are still @entity25 ' team			1
hell , they 're @entity27 's team			1
do n't let anyone tell you differently			0
since the glorious days ( and hair ) of @entity32 , when @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 owned the @entity36 -- tallying three @entity38 victories in the ' 90s -- the headline has been the same : " playoff victory escapes @entity17			1
" there are two unremarkable exceptions , of course , one being when we pounded @entity45 by 20 in a 2010 @entity47 wild card bout			0
that 's irrelevant to this conversation , but i wanted to take a shot at those ornery @entity53 fans so they 'll write hyperbolically nasty things about me below			2
it 's how they roll			2
back to the conversation at hand ... mr. @entity2 argues from a relative vantage point			1
the @entity17 , quite simply , suck lately			1
read why @entity2 believes @entity60 is the new face of @entity25 football the running backs are like delicate , porcelain dolls			1
the secondary and o - line look like sieves			0
@entity68 thinks wide receivers get new contracts for spending everything from their first one			0
our quarterback ticked off some voodoo priest who now spends his decembers stabbing the daylights out of his @entity79 doll			0
and the team is owned by a megalomaniac who believes prowess as a college football player and oilman qualify him to be the only @entity36 owner with a general manager title			2
this , after two playoff wins in 15 years			0
yet all this negativity does nothing to tilt the @entity17 ' crown			2
it does n't even scuff the throne			0
the @entity17 rule @entity25 , and no 2002 upstarts from @entity60 enjoying their first playoffs can take that away			1
that does n't mean the @entity12 have n't done something impressive			2
most fans ( especially i ) would be thrilled to see their team lose its top quarterback , running back , wide receiver , linebacker and cornerback for various stints yet still make the postseason			0
it 's commendable , but i 'm afraid it will come to a @entity112 ending saturday versus the @entity113			1
i could be wrong , but @entity114 is n't exactly inspired when you 're favored by three at home			0
win or lose , @entity60 has a long road to rival the @entity17 , whose eight @entity38 appearances are tied for most ever			1
our five @entity38 wins are second only to the @entity122 ( hurt to write that )			2
did i mention saturday will mark the @entity12 ' first playoff game ? ever ? the franchise is n't old enough to have a @entity126			1
our @entity127 -- what ? no @entity127 in @entity60 ? -- is rife with legends			0
in addition to the aforementioned @entity132 of the 1990s , there 's @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
those are just the hofers			0
i 'm not counting @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 or @entity148 ( and if anyone has a clue how @entity151 is n't in @entity152 , let me know			0
) though down now , the ' boys used to be mainstays in the playoffs			0
in the ' 70s , it was more common to see them in the @entity158 than not			0
that 's when they became @entity161			0
i know the moniker riles folks up , and it should			0
if you are n't a @entity17 fan , then your squad is n't @entity161			2
i 'd be sad and envious , too			0
before @entity169 and @entity122 fans start squawking about merchandise sales or some poll their pal e-mailed to them , let me assure you that none other than @entity175 christened us @entity161			0
because the @entity17 had so many fans in every city , narrator @entity177 was compelled to say during a 1978 highlight film , " they appear on television so often that their faces are as familiar to the public as presidents and movie stars			1
they are the @entity17 , @entity161			2
" @entity177 said later he thought it was a " catchy highlight title " that would never stick			1
but it did , and that 's what we call @entity194 now			1
it will take decades or longer before mr. @entity2 and i can seriously discuss whether the @entity12 rival the @entity17 in the @entity25 ( which , to be sure , is a reference to the state flag and not the @entity17 ' helmet )			1
maybe if @entity60 had bought the @entity10 that ill - advised stadium @entity202 would n't have shipped mr. @entity2 's boys off to @entity205			1
say what you will about our megalomaniac oilman owner , but at least he 'd never leave @entity17 that 's because the @entity17 are part of an elite class of franchise whose brethren include the @entity215 and @entity216			1
no matter how much hatred they inspire , there will be millions who love them			0
they 're in @entity194 , @entity221 and @entity222 to stay			2
can you imagine @entity224 threatening to move his team to @entity9 and change their name to the @entity227 ? yeah , me neither .			0

@entity230 takes issue with @entity2 's *assertion* that the @entity12 are @entity25 ' team
the @entity12 are a 2002 *expansion* team enjoying its first playoff bid against the @entity113
@entity17 ' *history* includes 5 @entity38 and greats like @entity139 , @entity137 , @entity33
@entity194 was christened @entity27 's team by @entity240 ' @entity177 during a 1978 highlight reel
