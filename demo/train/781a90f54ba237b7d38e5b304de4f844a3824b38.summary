@entity0 is all about the fiscal cliff these days			1
in @entity4 , @entity3 , world leaders are negotiating over climate change			1
federal debt and carbon emissions are indeed two big problems on the nation 's front burner			1
but they are just the beginning			2
as the fog of the election season lifts , @entity13 has a lot to worry about -- everything from competing economically with @entity18 to housing rapidly retiring baby boomers			1
but there is another way to look at it			2
decisively addressing the nation 's primary global challenges -- backed by the market potential of powerful demographic shifts at home and abroad -- could yield opportunity unlike any other in @entity13 's history			1
first , our four major challenges : in the last 20 years , households , businesses and the federal government accumulated exceptional levels of debt , which they are now trying , painfully , to pay down			1
the 2008 financial crisis triggered a spiral of unemployment and reduced demand that is nowhere near complete			2
as household income contracts , families consume less and try to erase debt , reducing demand for goods and services , forcing companies to reduce expenses , meaning more layoffs , deepening unemployment , and so on			2
monetary policy and fiscal stimulus may have contained the worst of the pain , but they can not cure the disease			1
@entity57 chairman @entity56 is right when he says the economy needs a broad - based and durable source of demand			2
over the last 20 years , roughly 1 billion people entered the global middle class			2
in the next 20 years , there will be 3 billion more			0
good news ? yes , except that these new consumers use huge amounts of resources and emit more carbon , a roughly 300 % increase			0
expect price increases for basic commodities like energy , food , and minerals , and deepening conflicts among the great powers over resources in familiar places : the @entity79 , the @entity80 , and @entity81			0
climate change is already with us			1
@entity84 , the @entity85 , @entity87 melting , and droughts in the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity18 , and @entity91 this past year confirm the scientifically proven trend			0
beyond this , humanity consumes about 150 % of the " goods " provided by the earth 's natural systems -- including fresh water , soils , and fisheries			1
we are consuming our limited endowment of natural capital , reducing future returns while our global population expands to 9 billion			0
this is massively destabilizing , whether you 're in @entity107 or @entity108			0
our infrastructure , systems , and supply chains are not designed for the scale or the risks of the 21st century			1
transportation , financial , food , and industrial systems have choke points , are inefficient , and lack oversight and sufficient investment			0
they are magnifying threat and risk when they should be compartmentalizing them			0
quiet disruptions in such things as rare - earth minerals ( critical to high - tech manufacturing ) , auto parts , and computer hard drives have all hit industry in the last two years , for example			0
opinion : we 're living the dream , we just do n't realize it @entity13 's economy must do some heavy lifting			1
just as the country transitioned from war production to civilian production 60 years ago , it must now transition to sustainable production , while building a new @entity13 dream			1
if it can , the @entity13 will be ideally positioned to rebuild our middle class , compete globally and pre-empt growing confrontation over resources			1
we must adapt and once again define the future			0
first , @entity13 has a homegrown demographic opportunity unlike any other			1
driven by baby boomers and millennials , 56 % percent of homebuyers say that they want the trappings of their @entity13 dream to be walkable and convenient , not car - dependent and isolated , and home prices already reflect this			1
from 2014 to 2029 , these two largest @entity13 demographics , each 25 % of the total population , will meet in the housing market as boomers empty their nests and as more millennials marry and have children -- creating the largest concentration of demand for housing since the period after @entity168 to seize this opportunity , however , @entity0 needs to let cities and towns decide how to grow , and discourage the car - based population dispersal known as sprawl			1
not only will this put @entity13 back to work in construction , it could reduce the environmental footprint by roughly a third			1
second , global demand for food and resources is skyrocketing			0
by 2050 global food production must increase by 60 % , while soil and fresh water must be regenerated , not depleted			0
@entity13 farmers are held back by expensive , distorting , and antiquated cold war era subsidies that essentially pay farmers to overwork the land and waste scarce water resources			1
we 've already lost up to 50 % of @entity195 's topsoil , drained the @entity196 , and created a fertilizer - based " death bloom " at the mouth of the @entity199			2
while conventional agribusiness is enjoying high global prices , climate - related drought and floods have reduced the harvest to the lowest since the early 1970s			2
shifting the worst of these subsidies from big commodity crops ( like corn , wheat , and soybeans ) to pay farmers to convert their operations to modern regenerative systems will help our farming families earn a more secure living and be better stewards of the land			2
finally , the world needs innovation			0
to accommodate 3 billion new middle - class aspirants in 20 years , we will need to make our resources more productive while reducing the amount of carbon emitted			0
by focusing on advanced materials , energy and manufacturing , we can rebuild our middle class , supplying the jobs , wages , and returns @entity13 deserve			1
to lead this revolution in resource productivity , we must stop taxing work and start taxing waste			2
@entity0 universalized the income tax to pay for @entity168 , when we had full employment and needed to subsidize resource extraction to get materiel to the @entity239			0
now we get 80 % of federal revenues from taxing individuals , are suffering from long - term unemployment , and consume far more resources than @entity244 for an inferior standard of living			0
we 're conserving labor and expending resources when we need to do the opposite			0
do we have the capital ? plenty			0
there are trillions of dollars in pent - up investment capital looking for reasonable , reliable returns , as the chairman of @entity256 recently wrote			0
instead of @entity0 footing the bill , the federal government must reorient the @entity260 subsidies for housing , agriculture , and resource waste and create a new generation of regional financing mechanisms			0
these new regional tools must connect @entity268 's capital to the infrastructure and innovation opportunities that will arise as regions plan for and build the future			1
if it 's done right , we 'll channel excess liquidity back into the productive economy and stop it from sloshing around as underperforming corporate cash , money market funds , and high - risk derivatives			2
yes , @entity0 must address the issue of the fiscal cliff and make progress on climate change			1
but isolated solutions will only waste precious time			0
tapping into the new demand pools of the 21st century , unleashing pent - up capital , and shifting @entity13 markets to lead a revolution in resource productivity will position the @entity13 to lead the world once again			1

@entity293 : fiscal cliff , @entity4 climate talks a *reminder* of challenges that @entity13 faces
he says there 's big opportunity too , if @entity13 harnesses *strengths* to demographic shifts
smart *responses* to *ongoing* economic *recovery* , climate and infrastructure stresses crucial
@entity293 : if @entity13 views these challenges *coherently* , it can once again lead in 21st century
