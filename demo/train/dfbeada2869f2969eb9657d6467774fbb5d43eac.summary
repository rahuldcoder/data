-- @entity4 captain @entity3 is set to return to action quicker than originally suspected after a scan on his injured knee revealed " no significant damaage , " the @entity2 giants said monday			1
@entity3 was stretchered off in agony in his side 's 1 - 1 home draw with @entity13 after a collision with @entity16 star @entity15			1
a lengthy spell on the sidelines looked inevitable but after a scan @entity4 said his right knee injury would heal in a matter of weeks rather than months			1
the former @entity22 international had returned from a four - game domestic ban for racially abusing an opponent , and made an immediate impact as he put the @entity28 club in front in the first half at @entity31 sunday			0
but then came his accidental collision with @entity15 , who later scored the equalizer for the visitors to put a dampener on @entity4 's title challenge			1
he took to @entity37 after the game to send @entity3 his best wishes			2
" hugs to @entity3 , i hope it 's nothing serious , " he wrote			2
@entity4 's first profit of @entity44 era @entity46 champion @entity4 had set the early - season pace , but now trail leaders @entity49 by three points after dropping into third place			1

@entity4 's momentum was derailed following claims of racism laid against referee @entity61 after the controversial home defeat by @entity49 on october 28 , which was followed by the arrest of a @entity4 fan who made an alleged monkey gesture at a @entity49 player in a cup game just days later			2
@entity3 was n't selected for wednesday 's @entity70 win over @entity71 , where @entity72 and @entity73 looked shaky in defense , but the former @entity22 skipper made his mark at @entity31			2
the 31 - year - old scored his 50th career goal for @entity4 in the 20th minute as he lost his marker @entity80 at a corner and powerfully headed home at the near post from @entity85 's delivery			1
but he had to be replaced by @entity73 after @entity15 fell on his knee during a tackle , following a mistake by @entity3 that gave the ball to @entity90			0
@entity15 , a hate figure with opposing fans after last season 's @entity94 racism controversy , matched @entity97 's @entity2 - leading eight goals this season when he headed home from @entity101 's flick - on in the 73rd minute			1
the @entity16 striker could have later ended @entity13 's run of five games without a win but was denied by keeper @entity106			0
the draw , @entity13 's sixth in 11 league matches , left @entity111 ' team in 13th place -- 15 points behind bitter rivals @entity49			1
@entity52 moved to within two points of @entity117 's @entity49 team , who came from two goals down to beat @entity120 3 - 2 on saturday			1
the pressure on manager @entity122 appeared to be increasing when @entity22 goalkeeper @entity123 failed to keep out a header from @entity55 defender @entity125 in the 21st minute			2
but last season 's top scorer @entity126 capitalized on poor defending to level in the 66th minute and @entity56 once again proved his worth off the bench with an 88th - minute winner			0
it was the @entity133 striker 's sixth league goal this season , and five have come as a sub			0
" the goals are my message			0
that 's the only thing , " @entity56 said after the match			0
" again from a free - kick we conceded a goal as stupid as against @entity144			0
we have to improve there			0
but after goal we were the better team for the 90 minutes and in the end we deserved it			0
even when we are losing we come back			0
" @entity52 also came from behind in midweek to draw 2 - 2 with @entity149 in a result that all but ended hopes of qualifying for the last 16 of the @entity70			2
@entity153 salvaged a 2 - 2 draw against @entity155 in the second - tier @entity156 on thursday , but could not repeat the trick against @entity158			1
@entity159 scored the only goal against his former team , giving visiting manager @entity162 victory against the club that sacked him in 2008			0
