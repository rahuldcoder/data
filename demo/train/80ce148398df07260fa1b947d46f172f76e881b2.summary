it may have been the most anticipated traffic court date ever			0
@entity2 resident @entity1 appeared in @entity4 traffic court on thursday for speeding and for wearing @entity6 while driving			1
it is considered the first time someone has been cited for wearing the face - mounted technology while driving			1
commissioner @entity10 threw out both charges , stating there was n't enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the @entity6 was turned on at the time			1
it is only illegal to wear the device while driving if it is operational			2
@entity1 was pulled over in october for speeding by the @entity19			0
the officer then cited her for wearing @entity6 under @entity2 vehicle code 27602 , which prohibits operating a video - display in front of the driver 's head rest where it can distract the driver			1
the law was originally drafted to keep people from watching tv while driving			0
@entity6 is @entity31 's early version of a head - mounted computer display			2
a small square monitor sits above the right eye , just out of the normal line of vision			0
to view information on the display like a map or text message , the wearer must look up			0
@entity6 defenders claim @entity6 is safer to use while driving than a smartphone since it can be voice controlled and you only have to glance up to view the @entity6 display			1
many rallied to @entity1 's defense , even starting a # freececilia hashtag on @entity51			0
when asked to comment on the case , a @entity31 spokesperson sent the following statement to @entity55 : " @entity6 is built to connect you more with the world around you , not distract you from it			2
as we make clear in our help center , @entity59 should always use @entity6 responsibly and put their safety and the safety of others first			2
" it 's early days for @entity6 and we look forward to hearing feedback from @entity59 and others in advance of a wider consumer launch this year			2
" on @entity31 's @entity72 page , the company warns : " most states have passed laws limiting the use of mobile devices while driving any motor vehicle , and most states post those rules on their department of motor vehicles websites			1
read up and follow the law ! " " anything that distracts you from driving is something that were concerned about , " said @entity19 public affairs officer @entity83			0
while the ruling was a big win for @entity91 , a product manager who wears her glass 12 hours a day ( she rested them around her neck while in the courtroom ) , it is not a green light for @entity6 wearers to freely wear and use their devices while driving			1
" it does n't necessarily answer the question everybody wanted : is it legal to drive down the road wearing @entity6 while it 's operating ? " said @entity102 of @entity103			1
@entity106 and his partner , @entity107 , are the traffic ticket attorneys who defended @entity1 in court on thursday			0
@entity6 wearers in @entity2 can still be pulled over and cited for wearing the head - mounted displays while driving			1
whether they get a warning or a ticket will be up to the individual officer			0
getting a charges dismissed will then be up to individual traffic court judges			1
" there is no law that that specifically says @entity6 is illegal			1
each officer has to take each case on a case - by - case basis , " said @entity83			0
a dismissal in court is not uncommon for traffic violations , and this ruling will not change how @entity19 officers view distracted driving			2
" i do think it leaves it up in the air for @entity6 wearers , " said @entity102			0
" they have to wear it with the possibility that they may get a ticket that they 'll have to fight until a legislator takes some sort of action			0
" three states have already drafted laws that specifically ban @entity6 while driving : @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 .			1
