-- desperately overcrowded , unsanitary , seething with tension and violence			2
hours after a fatal fire swept through a prison in the central @entity6 city of @entity7 , killing more than 300 people , an ugly picture is emerging of the harsh state of prisons in the country			1
and while the cause of the fire in @entity7 is not yet clear , observers say the conditions in which its inmates live are likely to have contributed to the high death toll			1
@entity20 , president of @entity21 , an international nongovernmental organization , says @entity7 is the worst prison he 's visited in the country			1
" it 's horrifically overcrowded			0
the bunks are sometimes five , six , seven tiers high , with the lowest person on the totem pole sleeping underneath the bunk on the bottom , " he told @entity0 from @entity23			1
" i 've seldom been anywhere where i 've seen such overcrowding			1
there have been a number of fires over the years and it 's surprising it has n't been worse or happened sooner than this			0
" you would n't have congestion like that in a dog pound , it 's so bad -- and very little ventilation , so i can imagine a lot of the guys died from smoke inhalation			0
" the conditions in the packed , airless dormitories are oppressive , depressing and inhuman , he said			0
" you wonder how the human person can adapt to living in those conditions , but they do			0
" the fact that the fire broke out overnight means most of the prison 's 850 inmates would have been asleep as the flames took hold			2
and once the alarm was raised , the authorities ' response is likely to have been hampered by short staffing and poor staff training , said professor @entity62 of the @entity63 at the @entity64 in the @entity65			1
many prisons across @entity67 are run - down , with crumbling infrastructure and poor maintenance , @entity62 told @entity0			1
an inevitable consequence is lax adherence to health and safety guidelines and fire prevention , making the chances of a devastating fire that much higher , he said			0
nationwide , @entity6 -- a country of about 8 million -- has capacity for about 8,000 prisoners but had nearly 12,000 incarcerated as of 2010 , equating to 40 % overcrowding , @entity62 said			1
the @entity79 raised concerns in a report last year , citing human rights groups as saying prisoners " suffered from severe overcrowding , malnutrition , and lack of adequate sanitation , " and highlighting issues of violence and abuse			1
the @entity7 blaze was the third fatal prison fire in recent years			1
in 2003 , 61 prisoners were killed in a fire at a prison in @entity96			2
in 2004 , the death toll was 107 from a fire in a @entity100 prison			2
the country 's prison commissioner said authorities are looking into whether a short circuit sparked the latest fire or if a prisoner perhaps set a mattress on fire			2
but questions are bound to be asked about the effectiveness of the authorities ' response			0
human rights group @entity113 called for a full and impartial investigation into what happened at @entity7 on wednesday			1
" the government must also take urgent steps to ensure that crucial lessons are learned and prison conditions are improved , so that such a tragedy does not occur again , " said @entity116 , @entity67 researcher at @entity113			1
another rights group , @entity122 , pointed the finger at overcrowding and criticized the @entity6 authorities for failing to address the conditions in which suspects and convicts are held			1
" endemic violence , the very poor infrastructure , poor staffing , badly trained staff -- all of these factors combined means that when something goes wrong , there 's a grave danger of loss of life and inability of the authorities to cope , " @entity62 said			1
gang membership is also an issue in the region 's prisons , said @entity62			2
prisoners who do n't already belong to a gang , or mara , when they enter jail soon sign up as a matter of survival			0
@entity20 says that from what he 's seen , a majority of the inmates at @entity7 are young men aged 18 to 25 and many are affiliated with gangs			1
about half are being held pre-trial , so they have not yet had their cases heard in court , let alone been sentenced			0
some may spend years waiting , a sign of the country 's painfully slow judicial process , @entity20 said			0
that adds to the sense of injustice and pent - up frustration in prison			2
while he said he has n't seen violence between inmates or on the part of prison staff during his visits , @entity20 said it is widely reported			1
" you can certainly see the tension when you go in with regards to the stand - off between various gangs controlling certain areas , " he said			0
" but @entity6 has been notorious for the violence of the system against inmates , and part of that is due to the inadequate training of prison officers but also because they are subjected to the same overcrowding , which in these conditions is very difficult at the best of times			1
" @entity7 's prison director was shot last year by gang members unhappy with the restrictions placed on their compatriots inside the prison , @entity20 said			2
sanitation in that prison is woefully inadequate , he added , with " awful " washing and toilet facilities			0
drugs are as easily available inside prison as on the streets , @entity20 added			0
corruption is also a big problem , with those who have powerful gang connections on the outside able to call the shots			0
" i 've seen guards providing women for prostitution to inmates in an organized way , very open , so the whole thing is seething with endemic corruption that feeds the violence , " @entity20 said			2
a similar situation exists in other @entity67 countries , he said			0
" with the gangs being able to pay more to the guards than the guards are getting in salaries , the power is where the money is			0
" while there has been much talk of taking on the corruption in the prison sector , @entity20 said , the chances of it are slim while other parts of civil society are also riddled with corruption			0
staff and volunteers with @entity21 are working to provide education and practical projects , such as growing food , to combat the chronic lack of anything for inmates to do , @entity20 said , and to give them some hope			2
the organization also runs a program that sends medical teams into the country 's prisons to treat such ailments as skin and dental problems , eye infections , and malnutrition , he said			0
@entity62 says there is recognition across most of the region that the current prison conditions are unacceptable , in terms of violence and poor infrastructure , but many obstacles lie in the way of reform			1
" you can not reform a prison system in isolation from the rest of civil society -- and where civil society is violent and dangerous and destructive , it 's no great surprise that it extends into the rest of the prison			0
