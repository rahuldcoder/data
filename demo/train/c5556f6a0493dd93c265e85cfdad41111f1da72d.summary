-- what makes a city " cool " ? if it means being loaded with atmosphere , charm , great food and nightlife , yet ignored by the bulk of travelers , then @entity3 deserves consideration as @entity12 's coolest capital			1
nightlife that can outlast @entity14 's if you think @entity14 stays out late , try a night out in @entity3			1
the city is less about heaving clubs and more about a roving nocturnal flow that ends ( maybe ) when dawn rises over the @entity20			1
the main action is in the @entity22 , where more than 250 appealing bars line a web of streets between graffiti - plastered walls			2
next is the riverfront , in the hip neighborhood around @entity29 do @entity31 railway station			2
typical of the offbeat flavor here is the converted brothel @entity35 ( @entity36 do @entity37 19 , +351 21 314 3399 ) where ace cocktails accompany erotica and @entity40 sets			2
capping a @entity3 night are pre-dawn traffic jams at @entity43 docks -- they 're created by the popularity of @entity45 , the king of @entity3 superclubs ( @entity47 +351 21 882 0890 )			1
experimental cuisine once known largely for bacalhau ( dried cod ) , quaint old coffee houses and louche taverns , the @entity50 capital now claims a range of restaurants			2
seafood remains a staple , but the trend is for modern , sophisticated and affordable			0
a high bar is set by wunderkind chef @entity61 at his @entity63 - starred @entity62 10 , +351 21 342 0607 ) or his more casual bistro @entity65 ( @entity66 7 , +351 211 992369 )			0
avant - garde @entity12 and @entity50 cuisine describes @entity61 's menu , which stretches from sea bass with seaweed to lamb with vegetable puree			0
further down the scale , @entity73 love juicy bifanas ( pork buns ) in backstreet eateries			0
no traveler to @entity3 should miss the famed egg tarts ( @entity80 )			1
the little bundles of caramel - y custard in chewy pastry are eaten in style at the original tiled café , @entity86 de @entity87 ( @entity88 84 - 92 , +351 21 363 7423 )			2
irony you 'd think @entity90 would brag about their achievements -- first global empire , world 's best custard tarts , sea bass with seaweed that actually tastes great			1
on the contrary , along with the rest of the nation , they excel in that ages old literary device / defense mechanism : irony			2
as @entity50 writer @entity105 once eloquently summed up the prevailing national outlook : " i 'd woken up early , and took a long time getting ready to exist			0
" that old entertaining melancholy has resurfaced with the austerity of recent years , helping @entity73 remain ( almost ) content and always witty , even in tough times			0
beaches and castles @entity3 is a place to inhale salty @entity115 air , sunbathe and hit the waves			1
dolphins surf and ferries ply the @entity20			0
half an hour away by train are the beaches and ornate casino of @entity122			0
a bit further , @entity123 is for eaters -- lots of grilled fish and seafood stews served in domed cataplana dishes			2
the other big day trip is to @entity131			0
forty minutes from @entity3 's main station ( @entity134 ) , it 's a time - warp town , located in lush , wooded hills peppered with whimsical palaces and mansions that epitomize centuries of aristocratic opulence			1
fabulous design wherever you look in @entity3 , sharp contemporary design is a hallmark			1
stylish leather goods , bold wine labels , interiors combining vintage with the latest designer pieces , spectacular buildings -- this is a city that loves to look good			1
pritzker - prize winning architect @entity152 set the modernist tone with his gravity - defying pavilion for @entity156			0
lisbonites gather to appreciate good design at @entity159 ( @entity160 24 , +351 21 888 6117 ) , their mutant fashion and design museum , where austere low - tech blends with baroque flounces			0
big art large @entity12 capitals such as @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity14 may have blockbuster art collections , but @entity3 's half million inhabitants have access to their own rare panoply			1
the classic is the @entity175 ( @entity176 , +351 21 782 3000 ) , where superlative @entity178 and @entity179 art occupies an airy 1960s building and landscaped gardens			0
in @entity87 , the @entity182 ( @entity183 do @entity184 , +351 21 361 2878 ) focuses on big names of 20th - and 21st - century art , from @entity187 to @entity188			0
@entity189 ( @entity50 site only ; @entity190 , +351 21 391 2800 ) is a 17th - century mansion packed with 500 years of artwork that reflects @entity50 's globetrotting history			0
@entity3 's latest exclusive is the impressive @entity182 do @entity194 ( @entity195 , @entity196 , +351 21 358 5244 ) , a superbly converted salt cod warehouse full of @entity199 exhibits where you can book a nighttime visit followed by dinner in the riverfront restaurant			1
fascinating streets there 's no getting bored wandering in @entity3 , thanks to the intricately patterned cobblestones under your feet -- a civic point of pride that blossomed after @entity3 's 1755 earthquake and continues today			1
even @entity3 's walls demand attention , thanks to an obsession with azulejos ( ceramic tiles )			1
top examples are found at the @entity220 do @entity221 ( @entity222 4 , +351 218 100 340 ) , while the peeling façades of the @entity225 and @entity226 districts show dozens of variations .			0
