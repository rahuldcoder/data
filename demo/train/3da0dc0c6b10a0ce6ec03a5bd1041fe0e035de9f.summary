@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is used to breaking new ground			1
18ct gold and sapphire earrings from @entity9 's " exclusive " collection in the 60s , she was the first woman to apprentice in @entity1 's jewelry district			1
today , she is heads up " @entity13			1
" a family business that has evolved into the first @entity1 designer brand and gained global recognition			1
her blends of @entity19 motifs , modern design and gold , silver and precious stones are worn by the likes of @entity25 and queen @entity26			1
in 2007 , @entity27 collaborated with @entity29 fashion designer , @entity28 , to provide jewelry for his catwalk collection at @entity32			1
they worked together again in 2008			2
@entity2 's @entity34 ( am ) sits down with @entity9 ( @entity3 ) and begins by asking her what makes her products so special			1
( @entity3 ) : we take a lot of research before we do our collections			2
we use a lot of cultural elements and items , using the great philosopher , @entity44			2
we turned a great motif to a modern motif			2
each collectin takes a lot of time before you produce it			1
i think this makes the collection and the products very personal and very special			0
( am ) : tell me about your collaboration with @entity29 fashion designer @entity28			0
( @entity3 ) : i think we met up when @entity28 saw our work and he liked it and came to meet me			0
i have something in common with @entity28 -- i think the flow of understanding			0
he showed me the collection and the colours of his work and we fantastically understand each other			0
( am ) : will the designs be different for clients in the @entity69 ? ( @entity3 ) : maybe they will not understand the verses and not understand the words			1
for @entity73 we are planning is taking motifs from various civilisations like @entity19 and turning them into modern jewelry which people will understand			1
( am ) : why did you look towards @entity73 in order to build your brand ? ( @entity3 ) : maybe because we do n't have a lot of @entity83 names , so all the rich people are buying foreign brands			1
maybe we have to make a name and then go back			1
( am ) : but you did go @entity69 ? ( @entity3 ) : i do go @entity69 because i see my work is very strong and it has to be the @entity69			0
i am very proud to take and @entity1 brand and an @entity83 brand and market it internationally			1
not because i want to take it back to the @entity83 world but because i am proud of what i produce and i want foreign people to wear an @entity1 brand			1
( am ) : now you have become this global name , you have started to target @entity101 arab countries			0
why ? ( @entity3 ) : as a family brand , i think we decided to expand and the nearest countries we had a good name in were in the @entity101			2
we have expanded in @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and we are working in @entity109 because they are the nearest markets in which we have a very good name			0
( am ) : is it a challeng when it can be perceived in these countries that only @entity73 names can offer high - end products ? ( @entity3 ) : of course , to have a product which stands beside [ brands like ] @entity120			0
it 's a challenge but we are very sure of ourselves because we are presenting something special			2
something which is different from these brands			0
( am ) : why is there a tendency for consumers to buy silver and gold , not for their design but for their weight ? ( @entity3 ) : when you talk about the masses of people in @entity1 and the @entity83 world , gold for them is their investment			1
people do n't put their money in banks , they put their money in the hands of their wives and the ears of their daughters			0
they do n't want to invest in added workmanship			0
it 's a simple , fabricated jewelry which if he sells after five years he will more money than he paid before			1
( am ) : tell me about the exclusive collection ( @entity3 ) : very few pieces are produced in this line - maximum 10 to 12 pieces based on precious metals , precious stones and handmade jewelry using techniques from our masters in the workshop			2
we do n't repeat it			0
we can do pieces for a client if she has a stone or would like something unique			0
( am ) : as the industry is dominated by men , was there a glass ceiling for you ? ( @entity3 ) : yes , it is a very dominant business			0
most of the big names in jewelry design are men and there are not a lot of women working in this business			2
( am ) : does it bother you when people call it designer ' bling ' ? ( @entity3 ) : it is quite a deep and nice collection not bling bling			0
i hate bling bling collections !			0
