@entity0 -- the government should n't make health care providers fully cover prenatal tests like amniocentesis , which can determine the possibility of @entity9 or other fetal problems , @entity3 presidential hopeful @entity2 said sunday			1
@entity2 , an outspoken opponent of abortion rights , told the @entity12 " @entity13 " on sunday that amniocentesis " more often than not " results in abortion			2
" people have the right to do it , but to have the government force people to provide it free , to me , is a bit loaded , " he said			0
the former @entity24 senator was arguing against what he called a mandate in the health care legislation passed by president @entity28 and @entity29 in 2010			1
he said saturday at an appearance in @entity31 that the law was intended to increase abortions and reduce overall health care costs			1
" one of the mandates is they require free prenatal testing in every insurance policy in @entity43 , " @entity2 , a conservative @entity35 , told a @entity37 luncheon in @entity38			1
" why ? because it saves money in health care			1
why ? because free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done , because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society			1
" he added that the requirement was " another hidden message as to what president @entity28 thinks of those who are less able			2
" the @entity60 referred @entity1 to @entity28 's re-election campaign for comment , and campaign spokeswoman @entity63 called @entity2 's remarks " the latest in a long string of unfortunate comments in the race to the bottom that the @entity3 presidential primary has become			1
" " prenatal screenings are essential to promote the health of both the mother and baby and to ensure safe deliveries , " @entity63 said			2
" these misinformed and dangerous comments reinforce why women can not trust any of the @entity3 candidates for president			1
" on sunday , @entity2 mentioned his own experience with this 3 - year - old daughter @entity80 , who has @entity81 , a chromosome disorder that often results in stillbirths or early childhood death			2
he said prenatal testing showed the problem , and doctors recommend abortion in virtually all cases			1
such a recommendation is common when any problem is detected through amniocentesis , said @entity2 , who added that in such cases " we know that 90 % of @entity9 children are aborted			2
" some studies since the late 1990s do suggest a high percentage of women terminate their pregnancies after receiving a down syndrome diagnosis , with one @entity101 study putting the figure as high as 92 percent			0
a 2005 study of nearly 1,100 pregnant women found 76 % would consider an abortion if tests indicated their child would be born with @entity9			0
now considered the main conservative challenger to the more moderate @entity109 , @entity2 has shed a more understated demeanor to challenge both @entity109 and @entity28 as the @entity3 campaign heads toward a series of key primaries in coming weeks , including @entity114 on march 6			1
he continued throwing out the cultural red meat for primary voters sunday night , telling a rally at a @entity119 church that @entity28 was intent on starting a cultural war			2
as the audience roared with applause , he called on the country to build a foundation that will " defend the church , defend the family , defend the nonprofit community , defend them from a government that wants to weaken them			0
" his attack on insurance coverage for prenatal testing was the latest in a series of controversial comments he has made since surging to the top tier of polls in the @entity3 presidential race			1
he also found himself defending other saturday comments regarding @entity28 's religion , appearing to question the president 's adherence to @entity143 - based @entity37 theology			1
@entity2 said saturday the president was not motivated by concerns for ordinary @entity43 but by " some phony ideal , some phony theology			2
" oh , not a theology based on the @entity143 , a different theology			0
but no less a theology , " he said			0
asked about those remarks on @entity12 , @entity2 said he was referring to @entity28 's energy policies , which he said favored what he called radical environmentalism			1
asked specifically if he was questioning @entity28 's @entity37 beliefs , @entity2 said : " i was n't suggesting the president is not a @entity37			1
i accept the fact the president is a @entity37			0
" instead , he said he was taking on what he called " an attempt to centralize power in the government			0
" " i 'm talking about the belief that man should be in charge of the @entity165 , " @entity2 said , and then in specific reference to @entity28 : " i am talking about his worldview and the way he approaches problems in this country			2
" but former @entity60 spokesman @entity172 said sunday that @entity2 's comments continued the kind of character attacks he said were typical of the @entity3 presidential race			1
" i think that if you make comments like that , you make comments that are well over the line , " @entity172 told @entity183 's " @entity182			2
" " i think this @entity3 primary , in many cases ...			0
has been a race to the bottom			0
we have seen nastiness , divisiveness , ugliness , distortions of opponents ' records , of the president 's records , " he said			0
the negative tone of the campaign was hurting the @entity3 candidates and causing low turnout numbers in some of the primaries so far , @entity172 added			0
" it 's just time to get rid of this mindset in our politics that , if we disagree , we have to question character and faith , " @entity172 said			0
" those days have long passed in our politics			0
our problems and our challenges are far too great			0
" the issues raised by @entity2 follow another religious - themed controversy over the @entity28 administration 's decision to require church - affiliated hospitals and other institutions to provide employees with health care coverage for contraception			1
catholic bishops vehemently opposed the move , and the administration changed its rule to require health care insurers to provide free coverage for contraception rather than the churches or other religious - based institutions			1
@entity2 's comments may appeal to some @entity3 voters who have questioned @entity28 's faith before , or others who saw the administration 's recent contraception mandate as an overreach			1
last month , @entity2 was criticized by some for not correcting a voter who called the president a @entity239 when she stood up to ask a question at one of his campaign town halls			2
on sunday , @entity243 gov. @entity243 , who flirted with a presidential bid last year , told the @entity1 program " @entity246 " that the contraception issue could benefit @entity3 if properly approached			0
" these are the questions that i think @entity3 can unite on , " @entity243 said			0
" they do have to be framed , as they really are , as the defense of individual freedom against the right now limitless power of the state			0
" @entity1 's @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 contributed to this report .			0

@entity28 's campaign calls @entity2 's comments " misinformed and dangerous "
former senator says prenatal testing such as amniocentesis increases abortions
the government should not mandate health care coverage of such tests , @entity2 says
@entity243 's comments continue a series of harsh attacks on president
