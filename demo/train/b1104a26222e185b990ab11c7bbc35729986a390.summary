@entity1 gunman @entity0 , the self - styled @entity2 jihadist accused of killing seven people , died in a hail of bullets thursday as police moved in to end a day - long siege			1
he was shot in the head as he jumped out of a window with a gun in his hand , authorities say , ending a deadly episode that has shaken the nation			2
as a picture emerged of a man who was known to the police and had apparently sought out @entity19 jihadists in @entity20 and @entity21 , many have questioned why it took so long to track him down			1
the 23 - year - old first struck march 11 , killing a soldier in @entity25			1
another shooting in @entity27 four days later left two soldiers dead , and a third attack on a @entity31 school in @entity25 monday killed four people , three of them children			0
announcing @entity0 's death , interior minister @entity33 said a special forces expert had told him they had never seen a suspect resist with such ferocity			1
@entity0 had shown what a dangerous man he was by first telling police he would negotiate and then declaring he would resist arrest with lethal force , @entity33 said			1
and when police finally entered his apartment , he burst out of a bathroom with guns blazing and continued shooting to the end , @entity33 said			0
@entity1 president @entity48 said that every effort had been made to take @entity0 alive , but in the end , no more lives could be put at risk to achieve that			2
@entity0 still had guns , ammunition and the ingredients to make petrol bombs in his apartment when it was raided , @entity60 prosecutor @entity59 said , and was wearing a bulletproof vest			1
@entity63 terrorism analyst @entity62 said that from an @entity2 perspective , @entity0 went down in a blaze of glory , still firing at special forces as he died			1
police wait , negotiate with suspect he had told police commandos late wednesday that he wanted " to die as a mujahedeen , " @entity59 said			0
but @entity59 , who is @entity1 's counterterrorism chief , rejected the suggestion that intelligence forces had failed by not picking up the serious threat posed by @entity0 sooner			1
@entity0 , a @entity1 national of @entity75 origin , had not followed a traditional route to radicalization or joined known @entity19 networks , @entity59 said , actions which would have triggered closer scrutiny			2
nonetheless , @entity0 had been under surveillance by @entity1 intelligence for a couple of years , having " already committed certain infractions , some with violence , " @entity33 told @entity63 affiliate @entity85			1
@entity0 spent considerable time in @entity21 and @entity20 , the minister added			1
his attendance at an @entity2 training camp there led to him being placed on the @entity91 no - fly list , a @entity91 intelligence official , who was not authorized to speak to the media , told @entity63			1
on wednesday , the interior minister told how @entity0 , under siege , had boasted of his actions to police through the closed door of his apartment in the southwestern city of @entity25			1
" he claims to be a jihadist and says he belongs to @entity2 , " @entity33 said			1
" he wanted to avenge the @entity106 children and take revenge on the @entity1 army because of its foreign interventions			0
" @entity59 said then that the suspect told the officers surrounding his apartment that he had acted alone -- and that he had intended to carry out more attacks on police and a soldier wednesday			0
@entity0 's only regret was that he was not able to kill more people , the prosecutor said , and he boasted of having brought @entity1 " to its knees			1
" @entity59 said @entity0 had initially indicated that he was not intending a suicide mission and wanted to live			2
but as the siege wore on , the chances of the suspect emerging alive receded			0
now all attention is likely to be focused on what caused him to strike -- and whether @entity0 did , as he said , act alone			2
investigators looking at a possible role played by his older brother , @entity128 , want more time to question him , @entity59 said , and are following up other leads			0
his mother is also being questioned			0
police tracked @entity0 down via his mother 's computer ip address , which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first shooting victim , officials said			1
@entity33 initially told reporters it was the ip address of @entity0 's brother that led investigators to him			1
but little is known about what triggered @entity0 's radicalization			1
in one clue , @entity59 said @entity0 had told police he started reading the @entity145 while in prison , after presumably being exposed to more radical ideologies there			1
lawyer @entity149 , who represented @entity0 in connection with previous minor offenses , said his client went to @entity21 two years ago			2
he had become suddenly radicalized , @entity149 told @entity85 , and wanted to become more involved politically			0
@entity149 last saw @entity0 , whom he described as having a " complex " personality , on february 24 , when he appeared in court accused of driving without a license and causing an accident with injuries			2
@entity0 was sentenced to a month in prison and was to appear before the judge again in early april to determine where he would serve that sentence , the attorney said			2
killings focus fears on ' solo ' acts of terror but a series of clues , some relating to a scooter used in the attacks , instead led investigators late tuesday night to the apartment in @entity25 where @entity0 holed up under siege , armed and dangerous			1
the shootings had already revealed a ruthless and determined killer			0
all seven victims were shot in the head , most at point - blank range , and authorities said they were carefully targeted because of their religious and ethnic ties			1
the gunman 's first victims were three soldiers of @entity185 origin who had recently returned from @entity21 , who were shot dead in two incidents			2
days later , the killer struck again , killing a rabbi and three children at the @entity31 school monday			0
more details of how @entity0 planned and executed the attacks are likely to emerge in the coming days			2
videos he took of the attacks , seen by police , suggests a cold - blooded brutality			2
" @entity198 , " ( @entity199 is great ) he says as he guns down the two soldiers in @entity27			0
@entity0 said he had posted the video online , but police do not yet know where , @entity59 said			1
@entity0 claimed to have trained with @entity2 in @entity20 's @entity206 region , bordering @entity21 , @entity59 said			1
he was sent back from @entity21 to @entity1 after being picked up at a traffic stop by @entity21 police who reported his presence to international forces , the prosecutor said			2
the @entity1 defense ministry said @entity0 had twice tried to join the country 's armed forces			1
the first time , in the northern city of @entity217 , he was turned down because of his prior convictions			0
the second time , in july 2010 , he attempted to sign up for the @entity222 in @entity25 , but left during the first round of testing , the ministry said			0
although his neighbors describe him as having been a quiet man , at home @entity0 had watched violent jihadist videos online , including footage of decapitations , @entity59 said			2
he was sentenced 15 times by a @entity25 juvenile court when he was a minor , the prosecutor added			0
police have questioned other family members in @entity25 , including his mother , @entity237 , @entity59 said			0
@entity0 was born in @entity25 in october 1988 , according to @entity238 , magistrate at the prosecutor 's office in @entity60 , and at one time he worked in a garage in a @entity25 suburb			1
he grew up in a northern suburb of city called @entity245 , which lawyer @entity149 described as an area with some drug - related activity			0
@entity149 told @entity85 he had represented @entity128 since 2004 or 2005 , when his client was a minor , mostly over accusations of theft			0
he said @entity0 had been " polite and courteous " and had shown no signs then of a tendency toward radicalization			0
that might have changed after his trips to @entity20 and @entity21 , but @entity149 said he did n't notice a big difference			0
" i knew he was politically active but he never spoke to me about this			0
he did n't want to talk about this , " @entity149 said			0
" he was very discreet on this			0
but i never had the impression that he was an individual radically different from the one i knew in the beginning			0
i always knew him as being someone very flexible in his behavior , courteous , polite , soft and certainly not rigid to the point of being led by a certain fanaticism			0
" @entity149 said that before the alleged murders , he had mainly been in contact with @entity0 's older sister , who , along with their mother , had been " exasperated " with @entity0 's minor crimes			1
" it was not possible to see him being serious , " the sister had said , according to @entity149 .			0

@entity0 was shot in the head in the police raid , a prosecutor says
he was wearing a bullet - proof vest and had more weapons
