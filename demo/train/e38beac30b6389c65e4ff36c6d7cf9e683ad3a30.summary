@entity0 , @entity1 -- at 17 years old , @entity3 is an honor student who aspires to be the first member of her family to graduate from college			2
but when it came to the application process , she felt lost , alone and ill - prepared			1
" i did n't really know where to start , " said @entity9 , who wants to be an astrophysicist			0
" there was n't really anybody at home that could help me figure out how i could reach my dream			0
" @entity9 's grandparents , who raise @entity9 and her two siblings , both work long hours to make ends meet			2
and neither continued their education beyond elementary school			0
fortunately for @entity9 , she was directed by her school guidance counselor to a nonprofit called @entity26			0
" it helps students who do n't really know anything about the college process , " she said			1
" college students come to you and they tell you how to do it because they 've been through it also			1
" strive for @entity37 high - school students with college students for free , one - on - one consultation over a yearlong period			1
each pair works together through the application process for colleges , scholarships and financial aid			1
" we take them through every little step of the process , because , frankly , it 's a pretty detailed process -- and if you miss one step , you could ruin all your chances , " said @entity46 , who founded the nonprofit in 2007 while he was a college freshman			1
so far , @entity26 has already helped 600 low - income students across the country enter four - year colleges and universities			1
and it expects to help an additional 900 this year			0
@entity46 grew up in an upper - middle - class suburb of @entity0 , @entity1			1
he attended private school throughout his early childhood , and he remembers his grandfather calling him a " menso " -- basically translated to " moron " in @entity65 -- for claiming everyone in the @entity67 got an equal shot at success			0
that pessimism started to make more sense to @entity46 when he transferred to a public high school in his junior year			1
" going to private schools , a lot of students who did n't do amazingly academically knew they were going to a four - year college because their parents had gone			1
it was just a given , " said @entity46 , 24			1
" whereas a lot of students at my public school , even if they had great gpas and @entity86 , they did n't know if they could go to a four - year college			1
it was just very foreign to a lot of them			0
" it did n't help that there were two guidance counselors for roughly 1,600 students			2
they just could n't devote themselves to students who failed to approach them about college -- the very students who @entity46 felt needed this help the most			1
" this made me realize that my grandpa was right , i was a menso , " @entity46 said			1
" and it made me firmly believe that this was a problem that was solvable			0
" @entity46 designed a pilot study during his freshman year at @entity109 in @entity110			1
pairing his classmates with low - income high school students at a nearby high school , he hoped to prove that college acceptance rates could be dramatically changed			1
the pilot 's success was astounding : 24 of the 27 seniors in the study were accepted into four - year colleges			2
in the previous year , the school 's acceptance rate was only 1 out of every 30 seniors			0
" at first it was like , ' wow , look at this amazing miracle that happened , ' " @entity46 said			1
" but i quickly could n't sleep at night thinking how many of the ( students ) the year before had earned the right to go ( to college ) and just no one helped them across the finish line			1
" @entity46 found that his study was indicative of a more widespread problem in the @entity67			1
" there 's over 400,000 low - income high school seniors every year who ( are ) qualified to go to a four - year college , and for whatever reason they just do n't go , " @entity46 said			1
and the difference between going to college and not going to college can often mean limited career opportunities or growth			2
over a 40 - year career , college graduates on average make nearly $ 1 million more than someone with only a high school degree , according to the @entity148 ( @entity149 )			1
" when my first ( mentee ) called me and said , ' i got into my first college			2
you helped changed my life , ' i started crying , " @entity46 said			2
" i was like , ' i think i really did help change your life			0
' and it was just an amazing feeling			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity158 with the help of high - school administrators , @entity26 targets youth who attend schools where 50 % or more of the students are eligible to receive free or reduced lunch			1
to participate , students must have a gpa of at least 2.0			0
interested students fill out a questionnaire about their academic and financial histories as well as their interests , abilities and ambitions			2
then they can attend a " speed - dating - style " session in which they choose their college student mentor			2
throughout the school year , pairs meet at the high school once a week for an hour			0
the process takes the students through each step : selecting their target schools , filling out applications , writing essays , obtaining letters of recommendation , targeting scholarships and financial aid , reporting test scores and completing entrance exams			1
" as a mentor , your role can be coach , pseudo-parent , cheerleader , " @entity46 said			2
" but it 's that amazing near - peer connection of young people with young people ... helping them through a process you just went through yourself , and taking the mystery and anxiety out of it , that i think is really important			2
" @entity26 also aims to help students graduate with the least amount of student loan debt possible , ensuring stronger graduation rates and enhancing the college experience			2
with scholarships and financial aid , 40 % of strive students attend four - year colleges without having to come out of pocket for their tuition -- compared with 32 % of low - income college students nationwide			1
beginning this spring , mentors and mentees will be able to communicate and track progress over the interactive " @entity222 " community website			0
the social network will allow students to track the curriculum 's calendar and see when their peers complete major steps in the application process			1
participants can make suggestions and bookmark items of interest for others			0
@entity46 has found that the social component helps students stay on track with their goals			1
" it creates peer pressure , but of a rare , positive kind			0
as they see one another looking at great universities and trying to aim for great financial aid packages , then their peers , their friends also say , ' if you can do that , i can , too			1
' and they start to raise their goals , " he said			0
" it 's a really powerful process in which you 're building a culture of achievement in the schools			0
" it 's a culture that helped @entity254 raise her own academic ambitions			0
the former foster child had never considered college as part of her future when she was encouraged to attend her first @entity26 session in her junior year of high school			2
" i 've never really thought of myself as the greatest student			0
college was not on my mind , " she said			0
" now i 'm a sophomore at @entity266			0
my full tuition is covered , and i 'm mentoring a high school student			0
" many former mentees , like @entity254 , become @entity26 mentors			0
" it 's that ' paying it forward ' mentality that is building a strive movement that will solve this problem , i think , within the next decade , " @entity46 said			2
@entity46 graduated from college in 2010 and has devoted himself full - time to his nonprofit			1
@entity26 now has 12 university chapters working in 15 high schools nationwide , and it is planning to launch eight more chapters this year			0
" the more we grow , the more students we help , the greater our impact , the bigger our movement , " @entity46 said			1
" we 'll go from changing hundreds to thousands of lives , to changing hundreds of thousands , and some day soon , even millions			0
" i 'm so sure this will happen , because i believe in our generation			0
i know the students we serve			0
and i know that together we are going to solve this problem			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity26 website at @entity292 and see how to help .			0
