meet our ranger : @entity76 is the public information officer at @entity24			2
originally from @entity77 , @entity76 , 57 , says her infatuation with nature started earlier than she can remember because her family took yearly camping trips in national parks			2
when @entity76 was 13 , they spent six weeks exploring national parks in the @entity85			2
at the @entity86 , @entity76 says she befriended a ranger			2
" he had quite a bit of patience with me , answered all the questions i had , " she says			2
" by the end of the four days , i decided i wanted to be just like him when i grew up			2
" @entity76 worked as an intern at @entity95 during college			2
after college , she applied to @entity86 " on a lark " and was hired as a winter employee			2
she spent eight years working as a seasonal ranger in six national parks before landing her first permanent job at @entity103			2
@entity76 came to @entity24 in 1988			2
" @entity11 has a little bit of everything , and it is extremely diverse , " she says			1
" whatever your mood is , you can do that here -- be on a mountain top , walk through a sheltered forest or walk on a beach			0
" for a day trip , do n't miss : seeing the sunrise from @entity115 , driving along @entity27 , visiting the @entity1 and heading toward the coast			1
" ( @entity118 ) is the place where you can experience a temperate rain forest , and it 's a pretty rare sort of ecosystem , " she says			1
" in spring , there are days when it really does look like the air is green			0
" favorite less - traveled spot : an approximately seven - mile hike on the @entity129 and @entity130			1
@entity76 said both roads are gravel and are at high elevations			0
they do not require a four - wheel - drive vehicle , she says , but do n't try driving an rv on them			1
" they tend to have 10 to 12 feet of snow during the winter and do n't typically open until part way through the summer , so it 's really a treat to get out there , " she says			1
favorite spot to view wildlife : @entity148 tide pools during low tide			0
the pools feature a variety of wildlife including star fish and anemones			0
" it 's kind of a whole new world and a whole new picture of wildlife , " she says			0
most magical moment in the park : @entity161 on @entity162			0
@entity76 went with friends to the beach to watch fireworks set off from the @entity166 ( it is illegal to have fireworks in national parks )			0
as the fireworks began to wane , she noticed the waves started to glow with bioluminescence			0
" wherever we walked and put pressure on the sand , our footprints were glowing behind us , " she says			0
" we ( also ) had these phenomenal natural fireworks that were happening in the water			0
" funniest moment in the park : stumbling upon a black bear in the @entity183 that was eating elk intestines like spaghetti noodles			0
" i was thinking about bears , and i was thinking about how it was the time of year that you have a fairly good chance to see one because they are emerging from their dens , " she says			0
" that was closer than i wanted to be to a bear			0
" @entity195 moment at the park : her daughter falling into a tree well while they were snowshoeing on @entity115			0
@entity76 says the winds that whip over @entity115 create massive snow drifts			1
but the snow does not accumulate at the base of trees , creating a well where you can sometimes see all the way to the ground around trees			1
" i was trying to introduce her to being an outdoors gal , and we went up to have a closer look at the trees , " @entity76 says			0
" she said ' @entity215 , ' and i turned around and she was n't there			0
thankfully , she was n't hurt			0
we do caution people to stay away from the tree wells			0
" a ranger 's request : pack in anticipation of varying weather patterns			0
" it might seem intuitive , " she says			0
" but i think it 's a little hard to overestimate how changeable the weather is and to be really be prepared for anything			0
" another park she 'd like to visit : @entity230 in the @entity231			0
the island is surrounded by a coral reef			0
" it 's an area of the country that i have n't been and so that is very interesting to me			0
