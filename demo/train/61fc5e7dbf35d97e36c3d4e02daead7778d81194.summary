@entity0 is making a reputation for herself as one of the hardest working women in tennis			1
grin and bear it : @entity0 hopes 2009 will be the year she wins a @entity8 tournament			1
only a few others on the women 's tour competed in as many matches as her last year , and her consistency , blistering forehand and an improved all - round game saw her end 2008 as the world @entity17			1
she prepared for the @entity19 -- under way in @entity21 -- in the punishing heat of @entity23 and hopes that winning her first @entity8 tournament under the harsh @entity21 sun will silence the critics who have questioned her right to the no. 1 spot without having won a @entity8 title			1
" i do n't understand why so many questions are being asked about that			0
i mean it 's not the end of the world			2
i just play my tennis and i enjoy every match			2
i go on the court with a smile and that 's all that matters to me			0
and if it will happen it will happen , " she told @entity39 before the @entity19			0
while sounding somewhat fatalistic about her chances at the first @entity8 of 2009 , it belies a determination that has propelled the upbeat 23 - year - old @entity43 from an early childhood in @entity45 to the top of women 's tennis and a jet - setting lifestyle			1
she moved from her native @entity43 to @entity50 when she was just 12 years - old , training at the @entity52 -- the same tennis camp that honed the skills of @entity55 and the @entity57 sisters			1
being away from her family from such a young age made her grow up quickly , she says : " i think i matured much faster than some of the girls my age and made me much stronger as well			2
" life as an international tennis professional also means life on the road , and @entity0 admits that sometimes it can be tough			2
" for me the most difficult thing is being away from my family and friends , away from my country			0
sometimes i just wish i was a normal girl , just staying at home and living a normal life , " she told @entity39			0
but her desire to be the best in the world and determination to succeed is galvanized by the achievements of her fellow @entity43 tennis stars on the tour , @entity81 and @entity82			1
" we are strong individuals and we come from a background where we did n't really have facilities to train , or the best financial status			0
we made it with our will and with our determination , " she said			0
" i 'm proud that we have gone a long way and we have achieved huge things coming out of a small country			0
and i hope that will inspire and motivate the younger generation and help them by building a tennis center so that they can train in @entity43 , develop their games and not have to go abroad like we had to do in order to become champions			1
in @entity43 people are following that sport and waking up at three in the morning to watch us play , " she said			2
if she can dispatch the opposition in @entity21 with the same composure and determination she 's shown in other tournaments she could finally have a title to match her ambition and give her compatriots something to really celebrate in the wee hours of the morning .			0
