editor 's note : this story is based on interrogation reports that form part of the prosecution case in the forthcoming trial of six @entity8 citizens charged with participation in a terrorist group			0
versions of those documents were obtained by @entity13 from the defense attorney of one of those suspects			0
the statement by @entity18 was compiled from an interview he gave @entity8 prosecutors in march 2009 in @entity22 and was confirmed by @entity24 prosecutors as authentic			1
the statement by @entity26 was given to @entity28 investigators and was authenticated by @entity8 prosecutors			0
@entity30 recruits say they received training in how to handle rockets , explosives and bombs			1
( @entity13 ) -- the interrogations of two accused @entity36 who say they trained and fought with @entity30 in the @entity40 - @entity39 border region provide an inside view of the terror group 's organizational structures			1
arguably , they shed more light on the state of @entity30 than any material previously released into the public domain			2
the documents reveal training programs and the protective measures the terrorist organization has taken against increasingly effective @entity24 missile strikes			1
@entity18 -- a @entity24 citizen who says he traveled to @entity40 in september 2007 to fight against @entity24 in @entity39 -- stated that between march and july 2008 he attended three @entity30 training courses , which focused on weapons , explosives , and rocket - based or - propelled weaponry			1
during these classes , attended by 10 - 20 recruits , @entity18 was taught how to handle a large variety of weapons and explosives , some of them of military grade sophistication , according to his account			1
read how @entity30 is now operating @entity18 stated he became familiar with seeing , smelling and touching different explosives such as @entity68 , as well as plastic explosives such as @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 -- the explosive @entity24 authorities have stated was used in @entity30 's attack on the @entity76 in 2000			1
@entity18 also learned how to make vests for suicide bombers			0
@entity18 stated he was also instructed how to prepare and place fuses , how to test batteries , how to use voltmeters and how to build circuitry for a bomb			0
read how @entity18 met with @entity30 leaders according to his account , @entity30 also offered a wide variety of other courses including electronics , sniper , and poisons training			1
instruction in the actual construction of bombs , he stated , was offered to @entity30 recruits who had become more advanced in their training			1
@entity18 ' training during this period was very similar to the training described by members of a @entity28 - @entity8 group who also spent time in the tribal areas of @entity40 in 2008			2
@entity26 , a @entity28 recruit , stated the group were given explosives training and taught how to fire rocket launchers and rpgs			1
@entity26 provided @entity28 interrogators with an account of his time in @entity40 after being arrested on his return to @entity109			2
three other members of his group are now in @entity8 custody awaiting trial for " participation in a terrorist group			0
" @entity8 prosecutors told @entity117 has been charged in @entity28 with participation in a criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing a terrorist act			0
a @entity8 legal document detailing his interrogation report was obtained by @entity13			0
like @entity18 , @entity26 said the group had been required to sign forms before their training			2
@entity26 stated his group was required to pledge absolute obedience to their handlers and indicate whether they wanted to become suicide bombers			0
@entity26 provided interesting new details about the training facilities being used by @entity30 in the tribal areas			1
his group trained in a small mountain shack , a far cry from the large camps @entity30 had run in @entity137 - era @entity39 , when it had been able to operate with little danger of being targeted by military strikes			1
@entity26 's account made clear that @entity30 has had to decentralize its operations in @entity40 in response to the growing effectiveness of @entity145 strikes			2
however the wide number of training courses described by both @entity18 and @entity26 suggest that @entity30 has been able to adapt well to the new security environment			1
by operating a larger number of smaller facilities , @entity30 would also appear to have increased its resilience to attack			2
read how @entity30 is looking for @entity36 targets while the classrooms are safer from drone attacks than the pre- 9/11 sessions on the mountainsides the content seems to have changed to match new targeting plans			1
suicide vest and ied construction show how the curriculum is being modified for today 's combat with @entity24 troops in @entity39			1
making and handling explosives , as well as fuse construction , show the sessions may also be geared for killing in @entity109 and the @entity24			1
these are the very skills the july 7 , 2005 @entity170 bombers @entity171 and @entity172 came to @entity40 to learn			0
@entity30 , it would seem , may still want to pull off the spectacular attack in @entity109 or the @entity24			1
@entity18 says he took a course in propelled weaponry with @entity177 , a former taxi driver in @entity178 , @entity8 , whom he first met in march 2008 and formed a friendship with			0
@entity18 stated that when they completed their training , @entity30 instructors did a written evaluation of their performance			1
@entity18 had been judged qualified to participate in missile attacks against @entity24 and @entity187 bases in @entity39 , according to his account			1
that suggests @entity30 has maintained its capacity for administration and paperwork even in a harsher security environment			2
when their training finished in the summer of 2008 , @entity18 and @entity194 lived in the same house in the mountains of @entity198			0
@entity194 managed to acquire a computer which he rigged up to watch jihadist videos			0
during a mountain walk with @entity194 one day , @entity18 says he was told about a new course being taught by @entity30 called " international operations " set up by @entity30 's head of international operations whom @entity18 later identified as @entity207			1
@entity207 , he stated , was responsible for recruitment and direction of terrorist cells , and attacks outside @entity40 and @entity39			2
@entity207 was identified by his initials in the legal document but @entity13 obtained his name from a source briefed on the case			0
he is believed to be still at large in the @entity40 - @entity39 border area			1
@entity18 was told that the training course that @entity207 set up focused on kidnapping and assassination , including instruction on the use of silencers and how to break into and enter a property			0
the revelations raise the possibility that @entity30 was developing a program of targeted assassinations			2
though @entity30 has carried out some assassinations in the past , most of its attacks in the @entity231 have not targeted any particular individuals but crowded areas , such as mass transport			2
according to @entity26 , @entity30 fighters totaled between 300 - 500 in @entity40 's @entity237 -- spread out in groups of 10			1
such decentralization was a function of the growing deadliness of @entity145 strikes			0
@entity244 , a @entity8 jihadist volunteer , said the group moved around a lot because such strikes were known to be " very effective , " his lawyer @entity243 , told @entity13			0
the loss of an increasing number of operatives , stated @entity26 , prompted an order from @entity30 's top command for fighters to remain inside as much as possible			2
in order to keep in touch , jihadists operated a courier service across the region , according to the @entity28 's testimony			0
the decentralization of @entity30 's structures appears to have created some costs for recruits			2
two members of the @entity8 - @entity28 group now in custody describe feeling increasingly cut off , bored , and fed up with the primitive living conditions in their mountain shacks , according to documents obtained by @entity13 and the defense lawyer of one of those charged			0
they often did not seem to know what their next orders would be or where their handlers would take them			0
they also described being deeply frustrated at being repeatedly given false promises that they would be able to fight in @entity39			0
@entity26 also described the group 's frustration at having to pay for their own weapons and training -- at a cost of 1,300 euros each ( about $ 1,800 ) -- which if true might lend credence to reports that @entity30 has come under financial strain			1
@entity18 , for his part , made no mention of having to make payments to his handlers			0
@entity18 and @entity26 's accounts also suggest that @entity30 may be having leadership problems			0
while able to find fresh recruits to replace those killed and arrested , the group seems to have more difficulty replacing senior military trainers and other key operational figures			0
a former @entity24 government official , specializing in counter-terrorism , commented that the insider accounts suggest the same people are leading training as a decade ago			1
the only difference , there are fewer of them .			0
