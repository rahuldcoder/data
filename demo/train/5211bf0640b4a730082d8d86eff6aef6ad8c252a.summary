-- a judge has ordered that the beard of maj. @entity4 , the @entity5 psychiatrist accused of fatally shooting 13 people at @entity7 , be forcibly shaved ahead of his upcoming military trial , base spokesman @entity2 said thursday			1
col. @entity9 issued the order , which will likely trigger an appeal that would further delay a case that has dragged on since the 2009 mass shooting			0
@entity4 's attorney had filed an appeal when @entity9 threatened to order the shaving , but the appeals court said it would n't issue a decision until the shaving was actually ordered			1

they also said that @entity4 , by keeping his beard long , is trying to associate himself with radical @entity46 fighters known as mujahedeen , the @entity7 press release said			1
in his ruling , @entity9 determined that @entity4 can not keep the beard because it violates @entity5 regulations			2

the next step would be the @entity66 , an independent tribunal with worldwide jurisdiction over active - duty members of the @entity70 armed forces and others subject to the @entity72			0
the @entity74 - based court is made up of five civilian judges appointed for 15 - year terms by the president			0
