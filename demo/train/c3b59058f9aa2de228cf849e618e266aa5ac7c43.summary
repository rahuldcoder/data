-- have you ever visited a building that gave you the creeps ? these 10 buildings around the world are guaranteed to send a shiver down your spine			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 still under construction , @entity9 's controversial modern temple is part traditional @entity13 temple , part white - frosted wedding cake , and part avant - garde art with a disturbing penchant for pointiness			1
visitors must cross a bridge to the temple over a field of fangs and hundreds of pleading white arms and suffering faces of statues reaching up from hell			1
while stark whiteness predominates , the inside and other parts of the temple compound ( including the toilets ) are sparkling gold			1
@entity8 is open daily ; the @entity33 is a short drive from @entity9			1
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 by the mid- 1800s , the crypt at the @entity35 monastery had been a popular burial site for centuries , with plague outbreaks and @entity43 contributing thousands of remains			1
in the 1870s a local woodcarver was hired to make creative use of the bones that had been piling up in the crypt			1
this was no minor task : the ossuary contains the remains of over 40,000 people , many of which were used to decorate the chapel			2
the effect is as beautiful as it is macabre : elaborate light fixtures , arrays of bells , furnishings , splashy wall treatments and coats of arms are all loving recreated from skulls and bones of all sizes			2
is that chandelier staring back at you ? to reach the monastery , drag your bones 800m south from @entity36 's main train station			1

@entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 under construction since 1987 , the massive and still unfinished 105 - story @entity77 in @entity78 looks like a luxury hotel designed for @entity82			2
nicknamed the ' @entity77 ' and described as ' the worst building in the history of mankind ' by @entity85 , construction halted due to lack of funding , and the partially completed building stood windowless and looming ominously over the city for 16 years before work resumed in 2008			1
strikingly modern when first designed , time has not been kind to the building , which now looks simultaneously menacing , dated , and unconscionably extravagant relative to the impoverished populace			2
once granted a visa , visitors to @entity79 have little choice in where they are allowed to visit or photograph , but at 105 stories , the @entity77 is hard to miss from anywhere in the capital			2
@entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 @entity104 's most morbid shrine , the operating @entity107 shrine of @entity103 is an unsettling but fascinating place to visit			1
stepping through the entrance you find yourself in @entity111 , where tormented spirits reflect on their wrongdoings			2
the ' @entity117 ' is a spiritual place to ponder your eventual demise , the ' @entity115 ' and the ' @entity116 ' have slightly less inviting names , while the ill might seek out the ' @entity121 '			2
other halls are less morbid , but no less interesting			1
visit during the @entity123 or the @entity124 to see the temple at its most vibrant			2
paying the extra @entity126 for a guide can be helpful for interpreting the aspects of the temple that might otherwise defy explanation			2
@entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 reputed to be one of the @entity133 's most haunted houses ( if there are degrees of hauntedness ) , @entity132 ' @entity131 has a long history of odd occurrences			1
@entity140 committed suicide in the house in 1949 and , ever since , strange things have taken place at the house , including doors that swing open spontaneously , glasses that leap off tables and break , and a tragically short - lived reality tv show			2
today , the mansion operates as a restaurant and inn that capitalizes on the morbid fame through murder mystery dinner theatre , @entity156 parties and weekly tours by a noted ' paranormal investigator '			1
stay the night if you dare			0
the mansion can be found just off @entity161 , south of the @entity162			0
find more information on spooky events and reservations at @entity166			0
@entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 a spiky @entity173 fantasy with more than a passing resemblance to a @entity176 temple , the monument to sir @entity171 is a beloved fixture of the @entity168 skyline			0
just 61m high , the climb to the top does n't sound daunting until you find yourself wedged into the preposterously tiny spiral staircase			0
the final curve is so notoriously tight that squeezing yourself out the final doorway requires the flexibility of a spelunker			0
@entity168 mystery writer @entity189 once set the scene of the crime at the top of the @entity167 , with much of the story focusing on the physics of getting a stiff cadaver down the twisty staircase			0
not a claustrophobe ? this might make you think otherwise			0

@entity75 : hotels where famous people have died 7			0
@entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 all of the inhabitants of the catacombs below @entity205 's @entity209 are decked out in their sunday best			1
unfortunately , that sunday was several hundred years ago , and the outfits have fared significantly better that the wearers			0
the mummified bodies and skeletons of some @entity215 from the 1600s through to the 1800s are kept in the catacombs for all to see , some so well preserved that they look eerily lifelike			0
men and women occupy separate corridors , and within the women 's area there 's a special virgin - only section			1
spooky for adults , probably terrifying for the kiddies - be warned			0
the catacombs are a 15 - minute walk from @entity205 's @entity232 along @entity233 or a short bus ride			1
@entity235 # 4 , @entity236 famously the site of the world 's biggest nuclear disaster in 1986 , the 30km - radius exclusion zone is mostly uninhabited today , but limited tours have been available since 2002 for travelers who are curious enough to get a glimpse of the industrial ghost town and are n't put off by the ominous click of a @entity247 counter			1
factories , homes , schools , and a particularly creepy abandoned amusement park stand decaying and choked with weeds , but remain much as they looked at the time of disaster			0
the @entity236 government has indicated that the exclusion zone will be increasingly open to travelers in the coming years			0
just do n't step on the radioactive moss			0
the best way to visit @entity259 is to use one of the several @entity262 - based agencies such as @entity263 or @entity264			0
@entity265 , @entity266 want to spend the night in the slammer ? why not make it a jail haunted by the spirits of former inmates and deemed unsuitable for prisoners in the early1970s due to appalling conditions ? opened in 1862 , the @entity275 was in operation for over a century , but it was hardly a hit with the prisoners who complained of cramped conditions and sanitation problems			1
it might not have been suitable for prisoners at the time , but if you 're a traveler on a tight budget and do n't mind that your room happens to be a prison cell and your bunkmate might be spectral , it 's perfect			1
as a ' prisoner ' today , your punishment includes parking , wifi , and a games lounge			0
to get yourself locked up for the night in the @entity266 capital , search availability here			0
@entity298 , @entity299 , @entity133 a gold - rush town a century ago and the finishing line for the @entity304 dog - sled race today , @entity300 is the perfect example of a honky - tonk , almost - at - the - @entity308 frontier town			1
overlooking the town and the @entity310 from the top of @entity312 is @entity298 , a weird @entity314 relic			0
from down in the town it looks like a bizarre space - age @entity318 , closer up it could be a film set for a shoot of the victorian - era @entity321			0
the four strange corrugated - iron sound reflector structures were intended for listening to suspicious @entity324 activity			0
for a real @entity299 experience visit @entity298 during the midnight sun : @entity300 and the @entity310 at your feet , the @entity308 just to the north and @entity330 not far west			0
