president @entity0 is n't ceding ground on his most controversial policies despite an election that delivered a stinging rebuke to him and his party on @entity6			1
during a roughly 90 - minute press conference wednesday , @entity0 gave no sign that he 'd accept major revisions to his signature health care law , change his mind on bypassing @entity12 on immigration or consent to @entity16 demands on energy and the environment			1
indeed , the president did n't do much to suggest that his @entity20 would work differently after @entity16 won at least 52 seats in the @entity22 and their biggest majority in the @entity20 since @entity24 while @entity0 made clear he had no desire to reshape his agenda , he did acknowledge that voters dealt his party a dramatic defeat on tuesday			1
" to those of you who voted , i hear you , " @entity0 said in his first public remarks since the election			1
to those who did n't vote , " i hear you too			0
" @entity0 avoided language like " shellacking , " which he used to describe losses @entity38 experienced in 2010			1
the closest he got to accepting blame for the campaign came when he said every election result offers a " moment for reflection			0
" " there is no doubt the @entity16 had a good night , " @entity0 said			1
the success of @entity0 's final years in office could rely on @entity49 sen. @entity48 , who is in line to become the next @entity22 majority leader			1
the two men have had an antagonistic relationship -- @entity54 once vowed to make @entity0 a one - term president -- but have occasionally found common ground			1
@entity54 worked closely with the administration , though mostly through vice president @entity58 , to broker a deal in 2012 to avert the so - called fiscal cliff			0
@entity0 reached out to @entity54 on wednesday and sounded an optimistic tone during the press conference			2
" you know , actually , i would enjoy having some @entity49 bourbon with @entity48 , " @entity0 said			2
watch : @entity16 's big night in 90 seconds still , the distance between @entity0 and @entity54 quickly became clear			1
they both identified tax reform as a potential area of compromise			0
but @entity0 described that effort by encouraging lawmakers to lower tax rates by closing loopholes -- a strategy @entity54 and other @entity16 have rejected for years			1
during a press conference in @entity49 , @entity54 urged @entity0 to follow @entity76 and @entity77 , who built domestic legacies despite often having to deal with a @entity12 controlled by opposing parties			2
@entity54 said those two presidents are " good examples of accepting the government you have rather than fantasizing about the government you wished you had			0
" " the president has really got a choice , " he said			0
" there certainly are going to be areas of disagreement			0
" it will take time to see whether @entity54 has running room from conservatives within his party who may prefer a strategy of confrontation			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , must consider how he can safeguard his own political legacy of health care reform , a @entity100 overhaul and an uneven economic recovery			2
but @entity0 insisted that the bitter polarization that has plagued his crisis - scarred presidency and turned his hair gray does n't get him down			2
" it does n't make me mopey , " he said			0
" it energizes me , because it means that this democracy 's working			0
