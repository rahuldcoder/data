-- the six - point peace plan for @entity2 proposed by @entity3 is doomed to fail for one simple reason : neither president @entity5 nor the government opposition is interested in making it work			1
for @entity5 , full implementation of the plan , which includes a political settlement through dialogue and respect for the rights of citizens to demonstrate peacefully , will bring an end to his regime			2
from the onset of the uprisings , his government knew that a repeat of the protests in @entity23 's @entity22 or @entity25 's @entity24 in @entity26 or @entity27 will mean regime change			1
@entity29 and his inner circle are not about to create conditions that are conducive for such sit - ins just because the @entity3 plan calls on them to do so			1
for the opposition groups , @entity3 could spend all the time he wants on negotiations , but any talks not predicated on @entity5 's stepping aside will not be acceptable			1
the activists who are spearheading @entity2 's revolution insist that the opposition exile leadership has a limited mandate and that is to discuss details for the transfer of power from the @entity47 to the opposition			1
the bottom line is that the two main protagonists in the conflict look at the @entity3 plan as a means to achieve their respective , mutually exclusive objectives			1
by agreeing to the @entity3 plan , @entity5 pursues a dual - track strategy : he appeases his @entity56 and @entity57 allies , who have been pressuring him to accept a political solution , while working to kill his way out of the crisis under the pretext that he is confronting " armed terrorists and gangs			1
" the opposition wants the cease - fire in order to field mass protests			2
as one activist from @entity74 put it to me recently : " we do n't need military intervention , we do n't need humanitarian corridors , we do n't need safe areas			0
enforce the cease - fire and millions will march toward the presidential palace demanding @entity5 's ouster			2
" after more than a year of uprisings , @entity2 is still stuck in a violent stalemate			1
@entity29 has not been able to crush the opposition , and opposition seems nowhere near to dislodging @entity5			0
increasingly , the conflict is being framed in existential terms , with some involved becoming more radicalized			0
the majority of @entity86 believe their physical survival is at stake , because they are convinced @entity5 's demise will engender wide - scale revenge killings on them			0
hence , they will not accept a solution that will produce a new regime in which they are not guaranteed a leading role			0
similarly , the opposition groups believe that if they stop now and @entity5 remains in power , he will hunt them down			0
absent a game changer that will tip the balance in favor of one side or the other , the crisis in @entity2 will become a full - blown sectarian war pitting @entity106 against @entity86 , which will likely spill over into the neighboring countries of @entity108 and @entity109			1
although military options have been considered by the @entity112 , it 's hard to say whether that would make a difference in reversing the dynamics in the country			0
a military operation might cause a regional war involving @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity57 , with each country supporting its allies in @entity2			2
for now , @entity57 's @entity123 has cast his support firmly with @entity5			0
a well - informed @entity57 source told me that the @entity57 regime will support @entity5 no matter what until the end			0
on the other hand , @entity56 's @entity2 policy seems to be in flux judging by its vote in the @entity134 recently			2
it 's too early to tell whether @entity56 will ease @entity5 out the way @entity120 did in the case of @entity139 's @entity138			0
@entity56 and @entity57 will probably not abandon @entity5 until they are part of the deal - making process about @entity2 's future government			1
one possible game changer is if the protest movement in @entity2 becomes widespread and covers large stretches of the country			1
to date , only four of @entity2 's 14 governorates constitute the major hubs of the protest movement : @entity152 , @entity74 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
while we have seen protests in other regions , they have not been as sustained and extensive as those in the four governorates			0
this is partly due to the state of fragmentation in the opposition ranks , especially among the exile groups , which do not inspire confidence among fence - sitters			0
although large segments of fence - sitters including businessmen have come around to supporting the opposition , many remain ambivalent because they doubt the opposition will succeed in overthrowing @entity5			0
this perception is reinforced by the fact that @entity3 's plan does not call for @entity5 to step down -- a detail that is not missed by the @entity5 regime propaganda machine			1
while the exile opposition remains divided , there are hopeful signs that the opposition ranks within @entity2 are becoming better organized , better trained and gaining legitimacy			2
the future leaders of @entity2 will not come from the @entity185 or the @entity186 ; they will emerge from the ranks of the revolutionary councils that are forming in different parts of the country			1
these councils bring together an eclectic mix of the most active local coordinating committees , independent activists , community and business leaders and military defectors			2
they are putting in place an administrative infrastructure that is akin to a local provincial council , handling everything from media affairs to helping families who lost their homes to providing legal aid to jailed activists			0
they are also coordinating with each other to protect relief supply lines that cross their respective territories			0
in the process , the leaders in these councils , who hail from @entity2 's different religious and ethnic groups , are developing political skills , cultivating local constituencies and learning through trial and error the business of governing			1
in a country that is increasingly polarized along sectarian and ethnic lines , these councils can perhaps provide the glue that keeps the country stitched together			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity229 : the peace plan for @entity2 proposed by @entity3 is doomed to fail
slim : after more than a year of uprisings , @entity2 is still stuck in a violent stalemate
she says one possible game changer is if the protests in @entity2 become more widespread
slim : *members* in local councils are @entity2 's best hope for future leadership
