@entity0 digs into his past in @entity3			1
@entity5 's first stop is @entity6 , where he worked in a kitchen for the very first time back in the early 1970s			1
it is also where @entity5 -- who is quite open about the heroin addiction he kicked decades ago -- was first introduced to drugs			1
@entity0 spends a day at sea with @entity14 and @entity15 , who are fourth generation fisherman -- scallopers , to be exact			2
they open up about how each day 's catch , and therefore the day 's take - home pay , can never be predicted			2
@entity14 and @entity15 explain how the industry is changing , making it increasingly difficult for independent fishermen to continue the traditions their families have held sacred for generations			0
@entity5 then heads to @entity26 to learn more about the heroin epidemic that is gripping the area , not unlike multiple rural @entity30 communities			1
he speaks to a local detective and other concerned citizens about battling addiction in the community			0
on a lighter note , @entity5 also visits @entity36 , an eco-conscious local brewery and gastropub that relies totally on food and resources within a 20 mile - radius and composts nearly all of its refuse			0
@entity5 also makes a stop at the second - oldest bowling alley in @entity44 for some candlepin bowling , going head - to - head with the @entity47 , a team of septuagenarians .			0
