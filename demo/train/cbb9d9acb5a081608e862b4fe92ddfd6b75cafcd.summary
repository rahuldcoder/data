-- with the weather warming up , a thrilling spring is in full swing for avid readers			1
there are a slew of new titles hitting shelves in may and a few recent releases you may have missed ; from spies to private eyes , @entity13 history to werewolves and a new riff on @entity16			1
for anyone looking to bury their nose in a good book at the park , pool side or on the front porch , here are five must reads for your consideration			1
' a @entity28 ' by @entity29 to many fans of spy fiction , @entity29 is king			1
over the past 50 years , he 's elevated the espionage genre to an art form in classics like " @entity35 , " and " @entity36			1
" now 81 , the @entity38 - born author has written his 23rd novel , " a delicate truth , " which addresses the war on terror			1
the book begins with a top - secret mission , codenamed @entity45			1
@entity38 and @entity47 agents are in @entity48 to capture a jihadist arms dealer , but the covert op ends in " an utter cock - up			1
" a conspiracy and attempt at a coverup soon follow			1
longtime fans will already know that le @entity56 was a member of the @entity57 from 1959 to 1964 , and writes with absolute authenticity about the kinds of spy tradecraft his characters employ			1
" a @entity66 " seems ready - made for the movies and not surprisingly , filmmakers are already working on a big screen adaptation			1
@entity29 himself appears in a stylized trailer for his novel that feels like a short film unto itself			1
watch the trailer and read an excerpt from " a @entity66			1
" ' @entity72 ' by @entity73 when it comes to horror fiction , vampires are so last year			1
the zombie craze is losing steam			1
werewolves are where it 's at			1
@entity73 , a contributing editor at @entity83 , takes lycanthropes to another literary level in his new novel , " @entity72 , " turning the monster mythology on its ear			2
the story takes place in an alternate version of reality where being a werewolf is considered a disease , spread by a mysterious virus			2
while doctors search for a cure , the infected live alongside the general population , only as second - class citizens			2
they 're shunned , segregated and treated with mind - numbing drugs to keep from turning into monsters , full moon no longer needed			2
there 's a guerrilla war being fought overseas in the ancestral home of the beasts , not unlike recent history in @entity110 and @entity111			2
@entity73 draws a pretty direct parallel with the war on terror , which comes to a head when a werewolf terrorist unleashes a bloody attack on a passenger plane			2
the sole survivor of the flight becomes one of several main characters readers follow throughout the book			2
there 's also a rebellious teen who 's the daughter of hippie werewolf parents , an @entity129 politician running a rabid anti-werewolf campaign and an underground network of werewolf insurgents with plans to carve out their own corner of the country			2
if you enjoyed @entity138 's apocalyptic vampire tale , " @entity139 , " then check out " @entity72			2
" it has a similar vibe and will appeal to readers looking for a tense , thrilling tale with some good grisly fun			2

" ' the @entity146 ' by @entity147 i 'll admit it			1
i 'm a sucker for a good @entity16 story			1
count me among the fans of the recent resurgence in @entity155 's iconic detective -- @entity158 's @entity157 action - hero version , as well as the character 's modern re-imagining in the @entity162 's " @entity161 " and @entity164 's " @entity163			1
" that said , any @entity16 fan would enjoy @entity147 's fresh new take on the @entity16 stories in " the @entity146 , " the latest in his series of books about the brothers of @entity172			1
the concept is clever , @entity173 and @entity174 are siblings who lease law offices at @entity179 's @entity178 , where they get mail addressed to the building 's best known , albeit fictional resident			2
there are fan letters and then a few pieces of correspondence from people who believe @entity16 is real and need his help			1
by answering the more persuasive sounding appeals , @entity173 and @entity174 ca n't help but get pulled into their own cases , including a potential plot against a member of @entity38 's royal family and a mystery that would even confound the famous fictional sleuth			0
@entity147 's characters are appealing , the story is light , fast - paced and thoroughly entertaining			0
for any @entity16 , it 's elementary -- this series is not to be missed			1

" ' @entity202 ' by @entity203 @entity205 , aka the @entity204 , is back in @entity203 ' latest noir novel , " @entity202 , " a romp through the seamy underside of @entity209			0
for the uninitiated , @entity205 is an ex-cop turned fixer			0
if you have an unusual , even criminal problem , and you need to cut through the red tape , fast , call @entity205			0
his solution may not always be moral , ethical , or legal but he gets the job done			0
that 's why he 's called the @entity204			0
@entity203 is the son of @entity157 legend @entity218 , the moviemaker behind such classics as " @entity220			0
" like father , son shares a love of quirky characters and screwball plots			0
case in point -- in the book , @entity205 is hired by the sister of a young actress who disappeared years ago in @entity157			1
his search for the missing girl takes him to the door of an aging and amorous movie mogul , who keeps a stable of starlets for some altogether unwholesome activity			0
the mystery goes even deeper with a fading movie star who has a dark secret , a missing screenplay , and a mysterious death on a yacht			0
there 's also a running gag about a foul - smelling ficus being passed around the characters in the story			0

" ' frozen in @entity258 ' by @entity259 when it comes to riveting nonfiction , author @entity259 has a knack for finding fascinating but forgotten stories from @entity13 his last book , " lost in @entity265 , " recounted the true - life story of a @entity47 military plane crash in the rainforests of @entity269 and how a small group of survivors , caught between enemy @entity273 troops and a tribe of man - eating headhunters , were able to stay alive and are eventually rescued			0
now in " @entity277 , " @entity259 takes readers to a much colder clime , @entity280 's @entity279 , the scene of another crash and another amazing rescue			0
there 's plenty of bad luck to go around and three plane crashes in the new book			0
first , a @entity47 @entity290 cargo plane goes down in 1942 over @entity280 , then a b - 17 bomber crashes during the subsequent search and rescue mission and then a " duck , " a small amphibious plane also disappears looking for the downed airmen			0
that 's just the beginning of the story			0
the real struggle here is the nearly five months the crash survivors spent stranded on the ice , battling blizzards and sub-zero temperatures			0
adding to the narrative , there 's also a connection to the present woven into the harrowing @entity13 tale			0
nearly 70 years after the crash , @entity259 , members of the @entity311 and a group of polar explorers go back to @entity280 looking for one of the original crash sites and a plane still believed to be buried under the ice			0
