@entity0 -- more than 50 members of a child pornography ring who engaged in what authorities describe as " horrific " and " unspeakable " crimes have been arrested for sexually exploiting children from 12 years old to as young as infants			1
top federal law enforcement officials say agents busted the global online pornography ring following an intense international investigation that began in 2009			2
the ring , based in the @entity15 , reached across five continents and 14 countries			1
seventy - two members of the online site called @entity20 have been charged in the @entity15			1
officials said 52 of them have been arrested in the @entity15 and abroad			1
the identities of the remaining 20 are unknown at this time			0
an additional 10 individuals were arrested abroad on charges from other countries			1
" in order to become part of the @entity20 community , prospective members were required to upload pornography portraying children under 12 years of age or younger , " said attorney general @entity26 at a @entity28 news conference			1
" once given access , the participants had to continually upload images of child sexual abuse in order to maintain membership			2
the more content they provided , the more content they were allowed to access			0
members who created and shared images and videos of themselves molesting children received elevated status and greater access , " he said			1
what particularly horrified investigators were " super-hardcore " posts that involved adults having violent sexual intercourse with " very young kids " who were being subjected to both physical and sexual abuse			2
@entity26 said , " some of the children featured in these images and videos were just infants and in many cases , the children being victimized were in obvious and also intentional pain , even in distress and crying , just as the rules for one area of the bulletin board mandated			1
they had to be in distress and crying			0
" homeland security secretary @entity72 said , " to give you an example of the scope of this forum , the capture and analysis of the forum revealed that the board may have been the vehicle for the distribution of up to 123 terabytes of child pornography , which is roughly equivalent to nearly 16,000 dvds			0
... additional media recovered from the targets arrested in the @entity15 alone has been found to contain over one million images of child pornography			1
" about 600 men belonged to the members - only online bulletin board , which has now been taken down			1
authorities said the site encouraged and rewarded members who sexually abused young children and made them cry			1
" as alleged , @entity20 had strict rules and a rigid hierarchy			0
its membership was tightly controlled by the group 's administrators , " assistant attorney general @entity98 told reporters			1
" applicants to the group were required to upload quote nude or hardcore child pornography to become members and members were required to continue posting additional images every 50 days or risk expulsion			2
moreover , members could increase their status based on their level of commitment to the enterprise			2
from member , to @entity118 , to @entity119 , to the most elite status of all , @entity121			0
only those members who produced their own child pornography could be granted the status of @entity121 , " @entity98 explained			2
" the members of this criminal network shared a demented dream to create the pre-eminent online community for the promotion of child sexual exploitation but for the children they victimized this was nothing short of a nightmare , " @entity26 said			2
one @entity28 investigator who asked not to be identified because of the ongoing probe said , " dozens of young children were directly victimized , " some of whom had been identified by agents working the case			1
of the five " administrators " who managed the online community , one was arrested in @entity143 and another in @entity144			0
the three others have not yet been identified by agents following the case and remain at large			0
" @entity20 " was spearheaded by agents of @entity148			0
@entity149 , the head of @entity148 , said the day marked a law enforcement " success " but was nonetheless a " sad " day because of the nature of the crimes involved			0
" there are days in this job where it 's hard to separate great success from great sorrow and today is such a day			0
it 's a day of great success because we 've brought an end to one of the worst instances of @entity165 child abuse @entity148 has ever investigated			0
... it 's a day of great sorrow because this case is ultimately a tale of the perverse and often violent exploitation of children , very , very young children to satisfy the dark pleasures of a group of adult men , " @entity149 said			1
the law enforcement effort has been quietly unfolding in stages during the past few months			0
four of the individuals arrested have already pleaded guilty , and all received sentences of more than 20 years in prison			1
those sentenced are from @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185			0
those arrested outside the @entity15 were picked up by officials in @entity143 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity144 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , the @entity193 , the @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198			1
@entity26 said , " it 's hard for me to imagine that there will ever be a penalty that could appropriately deal with this kind of conduct			0
twenty to 30 years that the people have gotten in the past is , from my perspective , barely sufficient to handle what they have done in damaging the lives of these young people			2
" @entity1 's senior producer @entity210 contributed to this report .			0

10 more men have been charged abroad
