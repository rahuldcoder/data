-- it 's hard to believe it 's been five years since @entity3 was rocked by terror attacks			1
life goes on , the city continues its chaotic beat			1
the next news story replaces the last one , the cycle of life goes on			1
the date 26/11 is now a somber anniversary the city marks			1
but for many , it 's something much more personal			1
the newspapers here today are full of pictures of smiling couples and entire families who lost their lives during the attacks			2
they accompany messages of remembrance in ads placed their by surviving family members who miss them and grieve for them			2
ten @entity29 men associated with the terror group @entity30 stormed buildings and killed 164 people			1
nine of the gunmen were killed during the attacks , one survived			1
@entity37 , the lone surviving gunman , was executed in @entity38 last year one of the pictures i saw in a newspaper today that froze me was of a broken blue wall inside @entity43 , the building where rabbi @entity45 and his wife @entity46 were killed			1
their baby son , @entity47 survived			2
my colleague , @entity50 and i were the first journalists allowed inside @entity43 a few weeks after the carnage			2
it was the hardest assignment i have ever had			1
the place had n't been cleaned			2
walls and windows were blown out , only half of the floors and ceilings remained			2
blood stains splashed across the wall , grenade shells and bullets littered the crumbling floor			0
one thing that stopped me in my tracks though was a broken blue wall			0
it was in the room that baby @entity47 occupied			0
his mother @entity46 had marked his height on the wall , with the enthusiasm of any young mother watching her baby grow			0
several little pencil lines marked every inch or two this young boy grew			0
i remember standing by this blue wall in 2008 , overcome with emotion , unable to get the cries of @entity47 wailing for his mother out of my head			0
i had seen and heard him at a service at a synagogue a few days earlier			0
@entity47 was saved by his @entity38 nanny , @entity88 , who carried the boy through the gunfire and smoke to safety			0
nanny credited with tot 's daring rescue @entity47 is with his grandparents and his nanny in @entity98			0
i think of this young boy often and i think of the families who lost loved ones during the attacks			0
my thoughts are with those who suffered bullet wounds , burns , trauma and injuries during the siege			0
nanny who saved @entity98 boy during @entity3 attack honored in @entity98 @entity3 continues to throb			1
but every year , on 26/11 , the city slows down a touch -- in remembrance and in solidarity			0
@entity3 attack survivor : ' it 's like a dead man living '			1
