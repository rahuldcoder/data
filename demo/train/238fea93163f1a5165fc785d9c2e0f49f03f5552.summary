-- seventy - one years have passed since that ninth day of april , 1942 , on the @entity1 in the @entity2 , where we witnessed the defeat of a once - proud @entity5			2
it was where gen. @entity9 , commander of all @entity11 armed forces on @entity1 , told his men , " we have no further means of organized resistance , we are low on ammunition , have virtually no medical supplies , and our food is all but gone			1
our front lines are destroyed and both flanks severely weakened			0
the situation has become hopeless			0
" then he continued , " if i do not surrender all forces to the @entity22 today , @entity20 will be known around the world as the greatest slaughter in history			1
" those haunting words of surrender , following the @entity20 , drifted down to the fighting men and women on @entity1 that sad day , which marked the worst @entity11 military defeat in our nation 's history			1
gen. @entity34 planned to keep troops on the peninsula and @entity37 until the @entity38 could provide supplies and reinforcements			2
but , according to an @entity5 history , the @entity38 was still in shambles after the december 1941 attack on @entity44 , and no ships were capable of bringing reinforcements			0
lacking supplies , the men on @entity1 fought bravely for four months against the well - fed , well - armed @entity22 military			1
the @entity49 believed in the unwritten samurai code of conduct , known as @entity51 , which held that the true warrior was willing to die for the @entity54 and would never surrender			2
@entity9 's decision to surrender was in direct conflict with an order he received from gen. @entity34			0
but he nevertheless ordered all of his troops on @entity1 to lay down their arms and surrender to the @entity49			2
@entity9 told his men , " you did not surrender ; i ordered you to surrender			0
" some 12,000 @entity11 and 58,000 @entity2 soldiers were surrendered that day ; records show that of the 70,000 men captured , more than 20,000 were patients in field hospitals , and the remaining forces were unable to perform effectively due to being impaired by malaria or dysentery			1
a pow 's ' @entity73 ' of the @entity75 , only about 1,700 lived to return home			2
the actual number is very hard to ascertain due to the large number killed on the @entity79 , with their bodies left on the side of the road or in the @entity84			1
once the surrender took effect , the @entity49 marched emaciated soldiers toward @entity88 , 65 miles away , according to the @entity5 history			0
the march became known as the @entity79 , not just because of how many died , but because of the way they died			1
if you stopped , you were killed			0
if you had a malaria attack and had to stop for help , you were killed			0
if you had dysentery and had to stop to relieve yourself , you were killed			0
without food or water , and with constant beatings , the march became unbearable			0
seeking a drink of water from a caribou wallow resulted in dysentery , and drinking water from a free - flowing artesian well resulted in being killed			0
and how did they kill you ? by shooting or bayoneting you , or by decapitation			0
and , in one instance , burying the soldier alive			0
the march was the beginning of three - and - a - half years of hell			0
if you survived the @entity79 , you were then sent to @entity22 on old @entity22 freighters whose military officers refused to place @entity116 or pow markings on the ships -- thereby making them targets for @entity11 submarines and air forces fighter planes			1
the freighters were known as " @entity122 " because they were attacked and severely damaged or sunk , by @entity11 fighting forces , leaving watery graves for thousands			1
if you survived the @entity79 , the pow camp in the @entity2 and the ship to @entity22 , you were then placed into forced labor with some of @entity22 's leading industrial giants , and required to work in their mines , on their docks or in their factories			1
the companies failed to feed us adequately , failed to take care of our medical needs , and failed to stop the physical abuse that was orchestrated and carried out by the civilian workers of those same @entity22 companies			1
the everyday beatings with shovels , hammers and pick - axes caused severe lifetime injuries to those of us who survived			2
@entity11 to pay ' forgotten ' @entity147 veterans the @entity11 military document we former pows had to sign as we were released from our pow camp stated , " you shall not discuss your experience as a pow with any source without prior approval from the @entity157 , doing so may result in severe penalties , or court - martial			1
" and the threat kept us quiet all these years			0
we have unfinished business with those companies who used and abused us @entity11 pows during @entity165			1
just last year , after 70 years of waiting , we received @entity22 's apology for the " inhumane " treatment by the @entity22 military , but we need an apology from those companies who allowed their employees to beat us on a daily basis for failing to work hard enough , work fast enough or bow low enough			1
we survivors want our honor returned , and one way to do that is through an apology issued by those companies who used and abused us during @entity165			2
we have found that dying was easy : it 's the living that 's hard			0
as we recall this anniversary of the @entity79 , we acknowledge that although the @entity49 stole our honor , deprived us the simplest necessities of life , and forced us into slavery , still our values remained intact and we never lost faith in our country or our @entity188			1
