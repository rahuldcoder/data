-- if you 've cast @entity3 as either an " @entity7 " runner - up , pop - country musician or both -- it 's time to re-evaluate			1
last week she released her third album , " @entity9 , " an 11 - song set of traditional country music reflecting the potent ballad style of classic stars like @entity14 and @entity15 as well as a rowdy side on a few numbers			1
but it 's " @entity20 " that finds @entity3 at her best : she 's sad and vulnerable throughout			1
anyone that knows the story of her strained relationship with her mother can hear the emotion wrapped up in this number			2
@entity3 's voice always worked in her pop - oriented prior albums , but with " @entity9 " she sounds wise beyond her 25 years , both in lyric and voice			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity3 about her new album , ditching a pop sound and writing with @entity35			1
@entity0 : the new record is called " @entity9			1
" should we infer this is your most potent batch of songs to date ? @entity3 : ( @entity41			1
) i guess you could say that			2
i 'm so proud of this record			1
i 've never worked harder on anything like i did this			1
i branched out , wrote with different song writers ; people i never thought in a million years that would write with me			2
i just really got to take my time and really go back to the roots of country music and show who influenced me growing up			1
i 'm happy that i had the freedom to sprinkle a little bit of that through the record			1
@entity0 : who are these people you were obsessed with when you were growing up ? @entity3 : i loved @entity14 , i love @entity61 and @entity15			1
i do n't know if it was the fact that their music felt so real and all of their songs came from a real place in their life			1
i feel like we were all raised the same			2
@entity0 : you had a rather rough upbringing			2
how much of that experience informs your work these days ? songs like " @entity76 " and " @entity20 " stand out			1
@entity3 : i 'd definitely say that my life is on this record			1
when my husband ( country musician @entity81 ) and i sat down and wrote " @entity20 , " there were no intentions of it to ever be heard or go into the studio to record it			1
i do n't really think about that when i sit down and write about what i 'm going through			2
i did n't write that song for anybody else but me i guess			2
sometimes it 's ok to do things for yourself every now and then			2
a couple of our songwriting friends heard it and they really encouraged me to think about trying to get it on the record			1
it 's one of those things that just kind of happened and there was no plan for it except for me to find closure			2
@entity0 : " @entity9 " has shifted to this more traditional sound			1
sometimes , it 's back - bar stomp , other times it 's these sleepy , pedal steel ballads			0
did you grow tired of the pop - oriented sound ? @entity3 : i never wanted to be a pop singer			1
i 've never wanted to be			1
i 've always wanted to make records like this			2
the first thing i ever said when i went into the @entity117 building was " i love @entity15 , i love @entity14 , i love @entity61			0
" look , times are tough for record companies and i get that they have a formula and have to play certain things safe			2
me not being an established artist ... they ca n't afford to take certain risks			0
i know who i am now , better			0
i was 19 when i got in line for " @entity7			0
" nobody knows who they are at 19 ; you 're not supposed to			0
i did this whole thing backwards			0
you come off a show like " idol " and you 're a celebrity , but for what ? you do n't have a song on the radio , you do n't have an album out			2
you 've been singing cover songs and you have n't done anything really			1
you have to develop backwards as an artist			0
become a celebrity first and figure out " what kind of artist am i and where do i belong ? " @entity0 : how does your writing go these days ? @entity3 : i just write about whatever i feel like that day			1
i do n't ever sit down with a plan			0
( @entity150 ) @entity149 told me -- and i never had anyone say this to me before -- she said " you speak in lyrics			0
" and i said " huh ? " she said " you speak in lyrics			0
" the first time we ever wrote , she 's writing down everything i 'm saying			0
i do n't know how to write about anything else but what 's going on			0
i ca n't just go in and make some bulls * * * up			0
i ca n't do that			0
it has to come from a real place or i ca n't write it			0
@entity0 : a couple of years ago , you penned a tune called " @entity171 " with @entity35			0
have you all talked about doing anything more together ? @entity3 : no we have n't			1
it 's been five years ago ... it feels like			0
we wrote that when we were out on tour with @entity176 and it seems like so long ago			0
but no , we have n't written since then			0
but even there , i stormed on our bus and i was upset about a boy and we just ended up writing about it			0
no intentions of writing , just talking and we started playing			0
@entity184 thought anyone would hear it			0
@entity0 : that seems to be a theme with you			0
write something you do n't think anyone 's going to hear , then release it			0
maybe one day i can release and album called " @entity195 " and it has all the song 's i 've written that nobody 's heard .			1

last week @entity3 released her third album , " @entity9 , " a set of country songs
" i 've never worked harder on anything like i did this , " she said
" i 'd definitely say that my life is on this record , " she said
