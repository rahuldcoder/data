-- it has been a long time since a @entity3 movie actually seemed like it could help people suffering from mental illness , their families and those who treat them			1
that 's why i 'm so encouraged by the response to " @entity12 , " which has enjoyed wide critical support since its release last fall -- including eight @entity16 nominations -- and is attracting a large national audience			2
it is the first film i 've seen in years that portrays mental illness in such natural and poignant terms			1
the entertainment industry has made a lucrative habit of exploiting deranged behavior for ostensibly artistic purposes , and has a long history of stereotyping " crazy " characters as killers , stalkers or perverts and misrepresenting mental health care			1
nearly 40 years after the release of the single most stigmatizing film in history -- " @entity35 " -- it is still invoked by people criticizing or trying to avoid care as if it is , or was , an accurate portrayal of mental illness and psychiatric medicine			1
" @entity12 " has the power to be an antidote to " @entity43			2
" and the timing of its general release is particularly welcome in light of the wanton killings in @entity49 , @entity50 , and the president 's initiative on gun control and violence			0
the president is right to seek legislation , but what is also needed is helping people with mental disorders get treatment , the first step in which is to reduce stigma			2
@entity65 mental illness explored in the aftermath of the senseless tragedies that just keep on coming and the stigmatizing hysteria that came with them , we desperately need a compassionate reality check against our exaggerated fears of people with mental illness			1
because they are not " the other , " " strange " or " foreign " people			0
" @entity12 " tells the story of a person , family and community in which individuals suffer from mental disorders much the same way as people do in the real world			2
it is not so much a story of mental illness as it is about two people who happen to struggle with mental illness -- among many other things -- and their relationships with family and community			1
the fact that the protagonist ( @entity99 ) and his father ( @entity100 ) suffer from bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder , respectively , and the love interest ( @entity104 ) has engaged in reckless self - harmful behavior in her transition from youth to adulthood , are simply aspects of their characters			2
opinion : get serious about mental health care their illnesses do n't define their identities -- nor are they even the main point of the story			0
in coming together , the characters find the mutual support that enables them to contend with their respective problems and redirect their lives presumably in a more positive direction			0
there have been comments that the film does not accurately portray mental illness and conveys negative messages about psychiatric treatment			1
and i think these criticisms miss the main point			0
this is a story in which everyday characters ( everyone ca n't have @entity139 's beautiful mind ) experience mental disorders as part of their lives and manage to cope with them and ultimately prevail			0
they overcome the emotional problems that affect them , as characters in other stories overcome different forms of adversity			0
review : ' @entity12 ' will give audiences a lift in portraying the characters in this story as affected by mental illness , the film communicates powerful and constructive messages that resonate with the public			1
it says that mental illness affects ordinary people in normal domestic settings			1
many people regard mental illness as remote and rare , only affecting people to whom the average person ( whoever that may be ) could not relate			1
yet epidemiologic studies tell us that one in four persons will suffer from mental illness in their lifetime			1
the film also shows us that treatment can work and people can overcome their disorders			0
all are not doomed to suffer			0
the main character in the film suffers from bipolar disorder , a condition for which there is a risk of violent behavior if symptoms become severe and go untreated			0
however , with the support of his family , the efforts of his psychiatrist and the love of a good woman , he avoids the tragic outcomes that we unfortunately have seen repeatedly in our society , and he achieves a new beginning			0
of course , continued treatment and support will be required to keep things on track			0
by providing this touching every - person portrayal of mental illness in the tumultuous aftermath of the horrific events in @entity50 , this film , ever so slightly , helps to ease our collective pain and provides a silver lining to this national black cloud			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity208 .			1

dr. @entity208 : entertainment industry has long exploited deranged behavior
" @entity12 " shows mental illness in " natural and poignant terms "
@entity208 : we need a reality check against " exaggerated fears " of mental illness
