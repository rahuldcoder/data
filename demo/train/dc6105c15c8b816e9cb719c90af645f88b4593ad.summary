in ransom for the release of @entity4 , the @entity6 journalist kidnapped and killed by the terrorist group in @entity8 , according to a spokesman for @entity10 , the news website for which @entity4 freelanced			1
it was never a serious demand , far exceeding the amounts of money paid for hostages held by jihadist militant groups in the past , which typically ranged up to several million dollars			2
but the demand does shine a light on two uncomfortable facts about " @entity19 , " or @entity22 , the dark netherworld of professionals who work to negotiate between murderous groups like @entity1 and the terrified families whose loved ones have been kidnapped			1
it also includes their worried employers and @entity31 governments such as @entity32 that will pay ransoms , and other governments , notably the @entity6 and the @entity35 , that will not			0
the first uncomfortable fact is that if you pay a ransom a hostage is more likely to be released			2
the other is that every time a ransom is paid it increases the chance that other hostages will be taken to help fill the coffers of a terrorist group			2
according to an investigation by @entity50 , @entity47 and its affiliates have netted at least $ 125 million in ransoms since 2008			1
that finding is similar to a 2012 @entity54 estimate that $ 120 million had been paid to terrorist organizations during the previous eight years			1
much of this revenue reportedly comes from @entity32			0
@entity32 media reported that the government had paid 20 million euros ( about $ 28 million ) for the release of four employees of a @entity32 nuclear firm			1
they were held by an @entity47 affiliate for three years in northern @entity64 and were released last year			0
the @entity32 government denied paying a ransom , but the @entity50 indicated -- based on reports from @entity68 and @entity69 -- that @entity32 did pay in that case and has paid out a total of some $ 58 million to @entity47 or related groups			1
not surprisingly , the @entity50 also found that of the 53 hostages known to have been taken by @entity47 and its affiliates during the past five years , a third were @entity32			0
the @entity32 government 's purported policy of negotiating with militant groups for the release of kidnapped citizens does appear to work			0
four @entity32 journalists -- @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 ois , who were kidnapped in @entity8 last year by @entity1 -- were released near the @entity90 border in april , blindfolded and with their hands bound			1
one of those hostages , @entity93 , had been held by @entity1 alongside @entity4			1
@entity93 is free , and @entity4 is dead			1
these are the facts that policymakers must confront as they consider what to do about the other @entity31 hostages still held by @entity1			2
who is @entity1 currently holding ? @entity1 holds three @entity6 , including @entity99 , a freelance journalist who was kidnapped last august and who the terrorist group threatened to kill in the video it released showing @entity4 's beheading			1
the names of the other two @entity6 being held by @entity1 have not been publicly disclosed ; @entity0 is withholding their names and occupations			2
two @entity109 women are reported to be among the militant group 's newest captives			0
a @entity112 and a @entity114 national were seized along with the two @entity109			0
the group of four was recently moved to @entity116 , an @entity1 stronghold in northern @entity8			2
for these hostages , there is always the chance that their governments will mount a rescue operation as the @entity6 did in @entity8 in july to try and rescue @entity4 and the other @entity6			1
that mission failed because the hostages had been moved from a location they had been kept in for some months			0
there is also the possibility that hostages could escape , as @entity6 photographer @entity128 did last year when he managed to crawl out of a window of the prison where he was being held in in the @entity8 city of @entity133 by an @entity135 militant group			0
but such escapes are rare , and while successful rescue efforts do happen , they are fraught with risks for the hostages			0
@entity144 , for instance , a @entity35 aid worker held by the @entity141 in @entity142 in 2010 , was killed in a @entity6 rescue operation , likely by a grenade that exploded near her			0
if there 's not an escape or a successful rescue effort , @entity31 governments whose citizens are held by @entity1 have only the options of either a negotiation involving ransom or the real possibility that their hostages may be executed			1
this is the sobering choice that faces president @entity161 and his national security advisers			0
it 's not much of a choice at all .			0

@entity166 , @entity167 : @entity1 *wanted* $ 132.5 million in ransom for @entity4
sometimes ransom works , but it can lead to more kidnapping , the *writers* say
minus a rescue or escape , options grim for nations -- ransom or execution , they say
