@entity0 -- with @entity3 adjourned until after the november elections , the campaign season accelerated thursday as top @entity5 accused @entity6 of a strategy of obstruction while the @entity10 @entity6 leader called for an overhaul of how the chamber works			1
president @entity13 met with @entity5 leaders from both chambers before they left @entity0 for the election fray back home			1
@entity5 sources said the party 's congressional leaders pushed @entity13 to be more aggressive in helping them campaign in the final weeks before the november 2 vote			1
their message after the talks with @entity13 focused on legislative accomplishments on behalf of working - class @entity25 despite the relentless @entity6 opposition			1
" the @entity6 strategy has been and continues to this day to create gridlock and failure , " @entity10 majority leader @entity28 , @entity29 , told a news conference			1
the strategy failed , @entity28 said , because @entity3 passed major bills including health care reform and @entity38 reform , " but they gave the impression to the @entity25 people that we could n't work together			2
" meanwhile , @entity10 minority leader @entity43 , @entity44 , laid out a sweeping reform agenda for @entity3 , promising to make spending increases much tougher if he becomes @entity10 speaker in january			1
@entity6 are pushing for a repeat of 1994 , when a conservative - driven wave helped them seize control of the @entity10 from @entity5 two years after @entity52 became president			1
this year , they are criticizing @entity13 and @entity5 for continuing to increase the federal deficit and failing to bring down high unemployment in the slow recover from the economic recession			1
@entity5 leaders have said they expect to lose some seats in the november voting , but they insist their part will retain majorities in both chambers of @entity3			1
addressing the conservative @entity63 , @entity43 promised to help usher in a new era of bipartisan cooperation , but also pledged to change @entity10 rules in a way that would strongly favor the agenda being pushed by fiscal conservatives , including the @entity72 movement			2
in particular , he proposed doing away with the " comprehensive " spending bills that have been a hallmark of the congressional appropriations process for decades			0
those measures authorize spending for multiple departments and agencies			0
" let 's break them up to encourage scrutiny and make spending cuts easier , " @entity43 said , later adding that @entity10 members " should n't have to vote for big increases at the @entity80 just because they support @entity82			0
each department and agency should justify itself each year to the @entity10 and @entity89 , and be judged on its own			0
" @entity43 also proposed a new " cut as you go " rule that would require any bill containing a new government program to also include steps to reduce the same amount of spending elsewhere			0
asked about the hostile political climate in @entity3 , @entity43 said : " there 's no question that there 's a lot of scar tissue that 's been built up on both sides of the aisle , and both parties are to blame			2
" @entity106 press secretary @entity105 agreed that @entity3 needs fixing , but he cited a different cause of the problem -- gridlock due to @entity6 intransigence			1
" we 've got judges that have sat around for 240 days , that passed out of a committee unanimously , " @entity105 told reporters , later adding : " it 's not the way that place should run			0
it 's not what the @entity25 people want to see			0
but it 's the way @entity6 have acted on @entity124 for the entirety of the president 's time here in @entity0			0
" house speaker @entity128 said @entity43 's call for reforms was intended to shift focus away from what she described as a dearth of @entity6 ideas			1
" it 's no wonder that mr. @entity43 wants to talk about process , " @entity128 said			0
" they have no substantive issues to take to the @entity25 people			0
we 'd rather talk about progress than process			0
" @entity13 already appears to be in campaign mode , traveling to four states this week to hold town hall - style meetings and address @entity5 rallies			2
at a meeting tuesday in @entity148 , @entity13 faced a range of questions but no matter the topic -- education , small businesses , military veterans , clean energy -- he repeatedly reminded listeners that the upcoming congressional elections would be their time to decide			2
" i hope everybody is going to pay attention and do their homework and find out about candidates , " @entity13 said at the end of the hour - long event			0
" and i think what you 'll find is , is that when you 're making choices for governor and you 're making choices for @entity89 and @entity3 , that these choices are going to mean something			0
" he encouraged people to ask themselves , " what direction do i want this country to go in ? " " do i want to invest in our people , in our middle class and making it stronger , and our infrastructure and our education system and clean energy -- is that one vision , " @entity13 said , " or are we just going to keep on doing the same things that got us into this mess in the first place ? " that 's the kind of messaging that congressional democrats want from @entity13 , according to multiple senior @entity5 sources who spoke to @entity1 after party leaders met with the president			1
@entity128 told @entity13 they wanted him to continue to make the @entity5 case on jobs and the economy , and to contrast it with the @entity6 positions , the sources said			1
@entity13 said he would , and signaled there would be more campaign events than the handful already announced , according to the sources			2
@entity1 's @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 contributed to this story .			0
