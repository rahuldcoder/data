-- @entity2 's curiosity about @entity3 has led to an exciting event : the dramatic landing of an suv - sized rover , set for 1:31 a.m. et monday			1
@entity8 's $ 2.6 billion rover , @entity7 , will make its dramatic entrance into @entity3 territory in a spectacle popularly known as the " seven minutes of terror			1
" this jaw - dropping landing process , involving a sky crane and the world 's largest supersonic parachute , allows the spacecraft carrying @entity7 to target the landing area that scientists have meticulously chosen			1
the spacecraft is " healthy and right on course , " according to the latest update from @entity8			1
curiosity has been traveling away from @entity23 since november 26			0
the vehicle , which will be controlled from @entity8 's @entity25 , has a full suite of sophisticated tools for exploring @entity3			1
they include 17 cameras , a laser that can survey the composition of rocks from a distance and instruments that can analyze samples from soil or rocks			0
meet a rover driver : his car is on @entity3 if all goes according to plan , @entity7 's first stop will be @entity42 , which may have once contained a lake			1
after at least a year , the rover will arrive at @entity45 , in the center of the crater			2
the rover will drive up the mountain examining layers of sediment			2
this process is like looking at a historical record because each layer represents an era of the planet 's history , scientists say			1
the phenomenon of sedimentary layers is remarkably similar to what is seen on @entity23 , in @entity63 's @entity62 or in @entity65 's @entity64 , says @entity66 , chief scientist of the @entity67			2
rocks and minerals found on @entity23 are different than on @entity3 , but the idea of a mountain made of layers is familiar to scientists			0
unlike on @entity23 , however , @entity3 has no plate tectonics , so the @entity3 layers are flat and not disrupted as they would be on @entity23			0
that also means that @entity45 was formed in a different way than how mountains are created on @entity23 -- no one knows how			0
images : exploring @entity3 in these layers , scientists are looking for organic molecules , which are necessary to create life			0
but even if @entity7 finds them , that 's not proof that life existed -- after all , these molecules are found in bus exhaust and meteorites , too , says @entity91 , part of the @entity67 science team			1
if there are n't any organics , that may suggest there 's something on the planet destroying these molecules , says @entity99 , assistant professor of @entity23 and atmospheric sciences at the @entity101 and collaborator on the @entity7 science team			1
but if @entity7 detects them , @entity99 said , that might help scientists move from asking , " was @entity3 ever habitable ? " to " did @entity3 actually host life ? " " a successful landing will grant a huge breath of relief to the entire @entity3 science community tonight , " @entity99 said in an e-mail			1
" and it will certainly keep @entity8 at the forefront of @entity3 exploration for at least the next few years			1
" liquid water is not something scientists expect to be apparent on @entity3 because the planet is so cold and dry , @entity91 said			0
if the planet does harbor liquid water today , it would have to be deep below the surface , perhaps peeking out in a few special places , but not likely to be seen by @entity7 , @entity91 said			1
rover to search for clues to life on @entity3 it 's hard to know how long ago liquid water would have been there because there 's no mechanism to date the rocks that rovers find on @entity3 , @entity91 said			1
evidence from the spacecraft @entity8 has sent to @entity3 so far suggests that the " warm and wet " period on @entity3 lasted for the first billion years of the planet 's history			1
" in order to create life , you need both the right environmental conditions -- which includes liquid water -- and you need the building blocks from which life is built , which includes organics , " @entity91 said			0
the @entity67 is a precursor mission to sharper technology that could do life detection , @entity66 said			0
there are n't specific molecules that scientists are looking for with @entity7			2
the attitude is : " @entity153 to an interesting place with good tools and find out what 's there , " @entity91 said			2
@entity8 's @entity25 was swarming with media this past week as scientists and journalists prepared for signs of the rover 's landing			1
@entity91 and a colleague told each other thursday they were both feeling " full of hope and optimism			0
" the @entity25 's confirmed list of " vip " guests included celebrities @entity171 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			1
but the excitement spread far beyond @entity8 locations : parties in honor of the @entity3 rover landing were scheduled around the world			1
about 300 people passed through the @entity187 landing party at @entity101 , organizer @entity184 said			2
the event included several presentations about planetary science , during which several attendees had to sit on the floor or stand in order to fit in the lecture room			0
the event switched to " party " mode around midnight , giving way to loud chatter about space exploration among science enthusiasts and researchers			0
@entity99 delivered a presentation about the history of @entity3 exploration			0
before @entity7 , humans have landed spacecraft on the equivalent of parking lots -- relatively safe , flat places on @entity3 , he said			2
by comparison , " tonight we 're landing in the @entity212 , " he said			0
interest was so great in the event that @entity215 stopped promoting it a few days before			0
the possibility of life elsewhere reaches beyond people interested in science , he said , and @entity7 points towards a potential revolution			2
" that 's why people are here tonight : they want to be part of history , " @entity184 said			0
what do you think about the @entity3 mission ? go to @entity230 although a lot of science went into this landing process , superstition on landing night ca n't hurt			1
it 's traditional to open up cans of peanuts and pass them around to the team at the @entity25 responsible for overseeing the landing of the rover , said @entity241 , lead flight director for the mission , earlier this week			1
" it 's always been a lucky charm for us , and missions have always seemed to work out better when we had the peanuts there , " @entity241 said			0
" for landing this , i 'll take all the great engineering we have , and all the luck you can give us , too			0
" sunday also happens to be the 82nd birthday of former @entity8 astronaut @entity254			2
it 's hoped the birthday will be auspicious for the landing , @entity8 's @entity255 said in a news conference			1
curiosity is supposed to last for two years on @entity3 , but it may operate longer -- after all , @entity260 , which arrived on @entity3 in 2004 , were each only supposed to last 90 @entity3 days			0
spirit stopped communicating with @entity8 in 2010 after getting stuck in sand , and @entity263 is still going			2
" you take what @entity3 gives you , " said @entity91 , also the lead scientist on the @entity260 , which includes @entity260			0
" if we knew what we were going to find , it would n't be this much fun			0

the dramatic landing of the @entity273 - sized rover is set for 1:31 a.m. et monday
this landing process involves a sky crane and the world 's largest supersonic parachute
