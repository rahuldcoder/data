-- two of the most experienced sides in the @entity3 face off against each other tuesday , including the host @entity4 , the only country never to have missed a @entity3			1
@entity4 's match against @entity8 will be the @entity9 's 99th match since the tournament began in 1930			1
but @entity8 's players are no slouches			1
this is the 15th time the country has made it to the @entity3 , putting it fourth behind @entity4 ( 20 times ) , @entity17 and @entity18 ( 18 each ) , and @entity19 ( 16 )			1

( @entity23 did defeat @entity18 and @entity33 in the group stage in 1982 , but was eliminated in the away - goals tiebreaker			2
) @entity29 has n't won a @entity3 match since defeating @entity33 in 1982 and has n't scored in its last five matches			1

tuesday 's matches follow what should have been an exciting clash of the titans @entity18 and @entity52			2
but it turned out to be a lopsided match dominated by one giant : @entity18 's @entity56			1
not only did he score the first hat trick of the 2014 tournament , but he has now scored eight goals in his @entity3 career , putting him level with legends like @entity63			1

@entity73 @entity72 helped @entity74 beat @entity75 for the first time and scored the fifth - fastest goal in @entity3 history in the process			1
@entity72 found the net only 29 seconds into the match , but @entity81 of @entity82 seems to be in no danger of being dethroned as the fastest scorer in tournament history			0
he scored only 11 seconds into a match against @entity39 in 2002 , helping @entity82 to a third - place tournament finish over the co-hosts			0
and while @entity90 might have been disappointed with a 0 - 0 draw against @entity92 on monday , the game did set a record for @entity90 -- it 's the first time in @entity3 history that its players have kept their opponents from scoring			1
it was their 10th @entity3 match			2
they 've won one , tied three and lost six			0
@entity92 has reason to be less pleased with monday 's result			0
it has now gone nine @entity3 matches without a win			0
