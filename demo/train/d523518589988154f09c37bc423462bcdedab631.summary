-- in the six months since the repeal of the @entity3 military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , many of the most prestigious military institutions in the country are adding a student group to their club rosters that they had never seen before : gay pride groups			1
for nearly 17 years , gay and lesbian soldiers were expected to deny their sexuality under threat of dismissal as part of " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" with the repeal of the rule on september 20 , 2011 , a new era began for homosexual members of the armed forces			1
but what about the young cadets preparing to enter their ranks , studying in the nation 's top military academies ? in december , a group of students at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , formed a group called the @entity31 , to serve as a gay - straight alliance on campus			1
the night before " do n't ask , do n't tell " ended , cadets at @entity35 , the nation 's oldest private military academy , held the first meeting of the school 's @entity38 , @entity40 , @entity41 , questioning and @entity42			1
these clubs are school - sanctioned , and their numbers are growing , according to cadets and school officials			1
even at the @entity48 at @entity48 , cadets are forming their own @entity31 student group			1
as one of the nation 's five federal service academies , the @entity3 @entity27 follows the same rules as the @entity3 military , and up until recently this meant " do n't ask , do n't tell " was a rule			1
even before the repeal , first class cadets @entity57 and @entity59 were among students at the academy who met with school officials to discuss what might happen if " do n't ask , do n't tell " were repealed			1
" no one was allowed to ' come out ' in the @entity71 , " @entity57 said , but it was an unspoken secret that many of the members of the group were gay			1
today , @entity57 and @entity59 are co-leaders of the @entity31 that boasts 60 to 65 members			0
they say the experience of going to the academy is one they would never trade , but they acknowledge that life is different since the repeal			1
" it 's hard to separate the personal changes from 18 to 21 ( years old ) , but the repeal of @entity84 was less like flipping a switch			2
it was n't like one day i 'm hiding my sexuality and denying who i am and the next i 'm out and proud			2
it was more like a continuum ; i progressed through my own comfort with being gay , " @entity59 said			2
" i had come out to friends my senior year in high school and was n't sure if i was ready to live under @entity84 , " @entity57 said			2
after a year at another school , she decided to go to the @entity27 after all			0
" i knew the @entity27 was what i wanted to do			0
i knew i wanted to go to the service academy			2
i wanted to show people that it did n't matter if i was gay ; i could just do my job and make friends			1
i thought i would put my personal life in the back seat			0
" she found this easier said than done			0
" i felt separated from my friends having to hide something that big , a part of my life , " she said			0
" we have an honor code at the school , and you practically had to lie to people when they asked if you 're dating anybody , if you had a boyfriend			0
" @entity57 and @entity59 say the @entity27 administration has been very encouraging of their club , with rear adm. @entity119 , the first female superintendent of the academy , a major supporter from the beginning , according to @entity59			2
other cadets have been welcoming , too , @entity57 said			2
" we 've had nothing but positive experiences with our classmates			0
we had some people coming up and telling us they grew up having negative stereotypes of gay people , but said , ' i know you two , i respect both of you , i 'm trying to break those stereotypes			2
' " from march 30 to april 4 , the @entity27 will host @entity132 week , a tradition dating back 37 years to one of the first @entity136 - @entity3 cadet groups on campus			2
the week has turned into a diversity week of sorts , according to @entity59			0
he said @entity31 plans to host a roundtable discussion with active - duty members of the @entity27 on homosexuality in the service			2
@entity59 and @entity57 received their orders last week and will graduate as full members of the @entity27 at the end of the school year			0
@entity35 , established in 1819 , is a small but well - known private military college in @entity149 , @entity150			1
as a private school , @entity35 never had an official policy discriminating against gay cadets , but since the majority of students accept commissions in the military , " do n't ask , do n't tell " was always a presence			1
" prior to repeal , the facts of @entity84 served to keep any @entity163 student quiet , " said @entity159 , a spokeswoman for the university			1
dr. @entity164 , a professor at @entity35 , is the faculty adviser to the @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity40 , @entity41 , questioning and @entity42			1
he described how on the last night of " do n't ask , do n't tell , " cadets met in the school library for the first meeting of the club			1
cadet organizer @entity171 raised all the blinds of the club to symbolize openness to the community			0
" right from the beginning , the intention was to be open , and that 's what has happened , " @entity164 said			0
the @entity163 group at @entity35 has even collaborated with a group called @entity181 to foster discussions and understanding , he said			1
@entity171 knew he wanted to be in the military for most of his life , even if it meant hiding his sexuality			0
" the military has always been a passion of mine			0
i knew i wanted to be in the military before i knew what sexual orientation was , " he said			0
" it was a sacrifice i , like so many men and women for generations before me , was willing to make			0
we love our country enough to put our personal lives on hold			0
" he believes that understanding and leadership are part of life at @entity35 , and one reason he helped form the @entity163 club			1
" i know i 'm going to be a leader in the armed forces when i leave here , " he said			0
" @entity35 teaches us when you see something not right , fix it			1
that 's what we did			0
" from march 26 through march 31 , the @entity163 group hosted what is thought to be the first " @entity216 " on a @entity3 military academy campus			1
the week was full of activities , workshops and discussions focused on anti-bullying , harassment and collaboration			0
there were @entity226 screenings , films on acceptance and stereotypes , and even an event called " the condom olympics , " which highlighted the importance of safe sex and distributed prophylactics			0
" no matter how you identify yourself -- straight , gay , lesbian , transgender , man , woman or whatever -- you could learn something that can help you whether here at @entity35 or out in the world , " @entity171 said			1
" over the next week or next month , we will reflect on the activities , and i have no doubt we will see @entity35 as a better place than it was a week ago			1
" @entity171 said turnout for pride week has been good , with up to 150 people at some events			0
the week culminates in a " @entity252 " on saturday night , consisting of a social that the head of the university and the governor of @entity150 will attend , followed by a dance where same - sex couples will obviously be accepted			2
" all these events have an ulterior motive : to show that gay people are people , " @entity164 said			2
" for some students , this is going to be an eye - opener			2
maybe what they 've been told does n't fit			2
" at the @entity48 at @entity48 , the cadets are still getting their group officially approved			1
" the primary purpose of clubs is beneficial to the cadet experience and beneficial to the @entity48 goal of graduating cadets , " said col. @entity269 , @entity48 chief of staff			1
" we want to graduate leaders who can go into any culture in any part of the world , " he said , " having the ability to speak with a diverse group of people and work effectively with different cultures			0
" the @entity48 club is also called @entity31 and is based on the @entity27 club			1
with its approval still pending with the commandant , @entity269 says cadets would welcome it			0
" as we prepared for the repeal of @entity84 , we underestimated the level of respect and acceptance of the younger generation , and we see that in our cadets today			1
it is not an issue for the vast majority , " he said			0
on saturday , a @entity48 alumni group called @entity302 will host a dinner at the @entity304			1
" while policies have changed so events like this are possible , i think attitudes have been changing for a long time , " said @entity302 out founder @entity310 , who was among the first women to graduate from the academy in 1980			0
" i do think it is always tough for young gay and lesbian people to be up front about their lives , but as long as gays and lesbians are invisible , some people will harbor prejudice , " she said			0
the dinner will celebrate the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell " and the formation of @entity31 at @entity48 , and it will include cadets , alumni and others , according to @entity330			1
representatives from @entity332 , the @entity333 and the @entity334 told @entity0 they have not been approached with formal requests to start @entity337 clubs at their school , but if the momentum started by cadets at other institutions is any indication , it is only a matter of time before they do			0
as @entity346 , a spokesman for @entity334 , said , " we have the diversity the whole world has			0
we do n't have a club now , be we could soon			0
