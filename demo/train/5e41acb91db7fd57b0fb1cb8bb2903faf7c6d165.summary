@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 prosecutor who dropped charges in a controversial rape case will ask a court to appoint a special prosecutor to review the facts and look at possibly refiling charges			1
@entity11 prosecuting attorney @entity10 said wednesday that he was making the request after @entity2 aired interviews this week with the alleged victim , @entity15 , who says she was raped when she was 14 , and her mother			1
at a news conference , @entity10 also cited a recent article in the @entity19 that questioned the integrity of the investigation			2
" the public trust in our criminal justice system must be upheld at all times , " he said			0
the case dates to january 8 , 2012			2
but after the @entity19 featured the story over the weekend , it gained traction on social media and spread to a wider audience			0
@entity10 spoke one day after lt. gov. @entity32 made a public appeal for a grand jury investigation into the case			2
why @entity35 wants justice in the @entity1 rape case the prosecuting attorney said that witnesses in the case invoked their @entity40 right against self - incrimination and declined to cooperate			1
@entity10 added that he could n't provide reporters with court documents showing the witnesses ' refusal to cooperate because those records are closed			0
he said he was upset that his decision was called into question in media accounts			0
" my name was dragged through the mud in that article , and i do n't appreciate that , " @entity10 said			0
referring specifically to the @entity19 story , he added : " the way the article was written inflamed passions			0
" city of @entity0 officials held a separate news conference after @entity10 's event and asserted that they had nothing to do with the county prosecutor 's earlier decision to drop charges			1
the city , however , has been targeted with cyberthreats in the wake of publicity about the case , and public safety patrols have since been increased , city manager @entity65 told reporters			1
" we 've been stunned by the nature of cyberthreats " against the city in general , he said			1
" in recent weeks , the city has received a great deal of negative attention			2
" it 's detrimental to the lives and livelihood of the residents of @entity0 , " @entity65 added			2
there 's been a public " misconception " that the city was involved in the investigation , he said			1
" the city of @entity0 was not involved ... in any way			2
" ' insufficient evidence ' @entity10 has said he dropped a sexual assault charge against the boy because the alleged victim and her relatives refused to cooperate			1
a charge against the boy 's friend who was accused of recording part of the incident on an @entity99 was also discontinued			1
the @entity99 video was deleted the night of the alleged assault and was n't retrievable , @entity10 said wednesday			0
the alleged victim told @entity2 that she believes the charges were dropped against @entity104 , then 17 , because his grandfather is a former state legislator			1
that relative , @entity106 , told @entity2 wednesday he had " absolutely " no role in the prosecutor 's decision			1
@entity2 does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because @entity15 and her mother , @entity113 , have chosen to go public			1
both mother and daughter have denied refusing to cooperate with prosecutors			0
@entity106 , a former @entity117 state representative who is a retired 32 - year veteran officer of the @entity118 , said he made a deliberate decision to avoid local police and prosecutors during the investigation because of his political standing			1
" as long as i 've been in politics and law enforcement , i knew that if this thing drug on long , i would be pulled into it somewhere , i think , just for political reasons , " @entity106 told @entity2			1
" so i made it a point not to talk to the prosecuting attorney , to the sheriff , to any of the witnesses directly or indirectly , and i stuck to that			0
and i 'm glad i did			0
" he said the case was dropped " because of a lack of testimony from the complainants			1
and without that , the prosecuting attorney has no case			2
" the ongoing controversy has been hard on his family , he said			0
" it 's been tough , " he said			2
" i mean , we thought it was over a year and a half ago , and to my knowledge , there has been no change , nothing more evidentiary has come up that i know of			0
" but ( the case has ) resurfaced , and i 'm not sure why , " he added			2
@entity106 , also a deacon in the @entity152 , was first elected to the @entity153 in 1994			0
he served four terms until 2002 , the @entity19 said			0
in a recent statement , @entity10 said that " there was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt			0
" @entity161 's witnesses refused to cooperate and invoked their @entity40 privilege to not testify , " he added			2
@entity11 sheriff @entity163 told @entity2 that his office and the prosecuting attorney had been ready to prosecute but did not move forward because the victim and her family refused to cooperate			1
" the only people 's stories that have been inconsistent throughout this whole thing are the @entity171 ' -- are the victims in this case -- and i do n't know why that is , " @entity163 said			1
protest planned reacting to the lieutenant governor 's call for a grand jury review , the sheriff said that his office handled the case " flawlessly			1
" in an interview with @entity2 , @entity163 described the elder @entity106 as someone he had known for more than 30 years			1
" he 's a man that i do consider to be a friend , " the sheriff said			2
but he described as " absolutely shameful " any suggestion that @entity106 would have tried to influence the investigation into his grandson			0
@entity113 said @entity163 had initially told her that other girls had come forward to accuse the same group of boys of similar conduct but changed his story			0
" he said that they were all liars			0
i digitally recorded him saying they were all liars and that they just wanted to crucify those poor , innocent boys			0
" so my concern is what is it going to take for them to do something here ? is one of these girls going to have to die ? " the mother said			0
in the weeks that followed her daughter 's alleged assault , @entity200 said her children received threats			2
she was also fired from her job as a veterinarian at a clinic			0
daughter @entity15 is now 16			0
the @entity171 have since moved from the 12,000 - resident town in northwest @entity1 , about 100 miles north of @entity212			0
in april , their house in @entity0 -- which had been vacant and for sale -- burned			0
the state fire marshal said that " due to the unsafe nature of the structure , a detailed examination could not be conducted and this fire loss is being listed as undetermined			2
" a @entity221 page campaign called " @entity222 " says a public rally is scheduled for tuesday at the @entity224			1
protesters will carry daisies in their hands			0
" we will increase patrols and do everything in our power to protect our citizens , " @entity65 said of the protest			1
" we will remain on high alert			1
" @entity2 's @entity234 wrote this story from @entity236			1
@entity2 's @entity237 and @entity238 contributed from @entity1 .			1
