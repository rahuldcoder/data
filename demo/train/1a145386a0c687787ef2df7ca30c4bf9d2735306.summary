-- it takes a disaster to remind us how much we depend on our local and state governments			1
in the middle of a presidential campaign , @entity5 has put @entity8 and @entity9 on the sidelines , reminding us how much we count on mayors and governors to protect us , to rescue us and to keep our streets , buses , subways , airports and commuter rails running			1
after a season of debates about the deficit , taxes and health care , @entity18 have discovered that they can not survive without government : to provide clean water , reliable transportation systems , and emergency services when floods , fires and power outages force them to abandon their homes			2
@entity5 even demonstrated that sometimes politicians should do more than what we want , especially when they are trying to save us from ourselves			1
when @entity37 gov. @entity36 ordered everyone out of @entity39 , most residents ignored his request			0
and when @entity43 mayor @entity42 , three days before @entity5 landed , activated the city 's storm plan and issued an evacuation order for the city 's high - risk @entity48 floodplain , many observers thought he was over-preparing , like a grandmother urging you to wear galoshes in the rain			1
opinion : do n't let superstorm sway your vote next time , evacuation orders will not be dismissed as examples of the " nanny state			1
" @entity5 did not just erode beachfronts ; it also eroded partisan political differences			1
how else can one explain gov. @entity36 's warm and gracious comments about @entity8 after the president did far more than what was required when he suggested that the @entity37 @entity68 personally call him if he needed any help with federal agencies			1
they become part of our culture , providing stories of danger and heroism that we share with our children and their children			0
disasters take neighbors and make them friends			2
@entity43 , widely considered to be tough and selfish , are suddenly eager to share cellphones , drink beer with strangers at their local bars , and to cook meals at home -- since without subways there is no way to go out for dinner and get home easily			2
there is one simple lesson we can learn from @entity5 : we can not ignore the essential infrastructure that moves people , information and goods			1
how you can help these systems are under the control of mayors and governors -- not presidents , senators or members of @entity109			0
more than two - thirds of the funds spent on transportation come from states and localities , not from the federal government			0
and with today 's current emphasis on cutting the federal deficit , states will need to do more since the federal government is clearly in retreat , at home and overseas			0
it is not sufficient to have a smartphone or an @entity122 if we do not have resilient , robust networks that can function when we need them most , like in a disaster			2
it is not sufficient to have a home , if there is no power to run appliances and water to drink and cook with			0
and , what good is a job if you can not get to work -- whether by car , train , bus or plane ? @entity43 has a subway system that is more than a century old			0
our nation 's airports control our airspace with obsolete technologies , needlessly adding to delays and pollution			0
and our commuter railroads rely on railroad bridges that are well beyond their shelf life			2
disaster relief : @entity8 , @entity9 differ on federal role @entity5 is not over			1
the damage is still being assessed			0
the recovery is going to be slower than we anticipate			0
and the losses are beyond measurement			0
homes destroyed , beaches reconfigured , boardwalks that can not be replaced , and memories that can not be renewed			0
but we can recognize the vital need to invest in the future : to take steps now to minimize similar disasters			1
we can not eliminate the power of ocean currents and wind and storms , but we can do more to invest in stronger , safer transportation systems that can diminish the disruptions caused by the next hurricane			2
@entity5 certainly wo n't be the last of the destructive storms we encounter			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			1

@entity182 : disaster reminds us how much we rely on our local governments
@entity180 : @entity5 has put president @entity8 and @entity9 on the sidelines
he says the storm also teaches us that we ca n't ignore essential infrastructures
@entity180 : we have to invest in the future by taking steps now to minimize similar disasters
