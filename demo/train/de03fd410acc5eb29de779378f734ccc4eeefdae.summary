@entity0 -- nobody seems to have a positive word for mayor @entity5 's proposal to ban oversized servings of sugary drinks in @entity9 's food - service establishments			1
the mayor has been decried as a nanny			1
he has been accused of selective enforcement			0
( a @entity14 20 ounce drink can have more than 500 calories , but will be exempt from the ban because it contains more than 50 % milk			1
) the beverage industry complains that solutions to the obesity problem ought to be more " comprehensive			1
" one important conservative magazine called the mayor 's actions a form of " fascism			1
" so let 's defy the trend here and say : good for @entity5			1
obesity is @entity31 's most important public health problem , and the mayor has led the way against it			1
this latest idea may or may not yield results			0
but it is already raising awareness			0
even if it fails to become law , it ought to prod the beverage industry into acting as more responsible corporate citizens			0
sugary drinks now provide 7 % of the calories in the @entity31 diet , the largest single national source of calories			1
teen boys average more than a quart of sugary soda per day			1
even adults who say they are trying to lose weight still drink more two 12 - ounces cans per day , on average			0
there is little doubt about the serious health effects of sugary soda			1
just one soda a day doubles a woman 's risk of diabetes , according to the @entity62			1
two sodas raises her risk of heart disease by 40 %			0
@entity31 drink more soda for the very simple reason : it 's getting cheaper			1
the inflation - adjusted price of soda has declined by an estimated 48 % over the past 20 years			1
improvements in packaging account for much of this price decline			0
it costs barely anything more to manufacture a 64 - ounce " double gulp " container than to produce the former standard sizes			0
opinion : big gulp ? meet big brother some object that the mayor 's proposal to restrict serving sizes will restrict liberty			2
but the liberty restricted is not the liberty of the soda - drinker			2
if they wish , soda drinkers can buy a 2 - liter bottle of soda at the grocery for about $ 1.70 and pour as much of it down their throats as they wish			2
the liberty that is being restricted is the liberty of the soda seller to manipulate known human weaknesses to the seller 's advantage and the buyer 's detriment			2
human beings are not reasoning machines			0
we are animals who have inherited certain propensities not always well - adapted to modern urban life			0
we evolved in conditions of food scarcity			0
our bodies have adapted to store food energy against famine ; our subrational minds crave sweetness			0
the sugary beverage industry has invested massively to understand better how to use our very human natures against us			2
the ever - increasing size of the standard soda serving has changed our understanding of what is and what is not an appropriate amount of sugar to consume at a sitting			2
the beverage industry works on @entity31 before they have learned to read ; even before they have learned to speak			0
in 2010 , children and teens were exposed to twice as many full - calorie soda tv ads as they were in 2008 , according to a study by the @entity130 and @entity131			2
the beverage industry is correct that a soda crackdown alone will not on its own address the obesity problem			1
@entity31 spend twice as much time in cars as in the 1970s and average more than 26 hours per week of sedentary entertainment			0
some 80 % of @entity31 do no physical exercise at all			0
as i 've written before in this space : " the campaign against obesity will have to look a lot less like the campaign against smoking ( which involves just one decision , to smoke or not to smoke ) and much more like the generation - long campaign against highway fatalities , which required the redesign of cars , the redesign of highways , and changes in personal behavior like seat - belt use and drunk driving			2
" but if a restraint on soda serving size will not do everything , it may still do something			2
the idea is an experiment , and most experiments fail			0
we learn from failure how to design a better effort next time			0
and when we do at least succeed in this difficult struggle for public health , we will all owe @entity9 's visionary mayor our thanks for leading the way			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			1

@entity9 mayor @entity5 being *criticized* for his stance on soda
@entity175 says the mayor should be *applauded* for trying to *tackle* obesity issue
he says the proposed ban on *supersized* soda is aimed at sellers , not at buyers ' liberties
@entity191 : there is little doubt about the serious health effects of sugary soda
