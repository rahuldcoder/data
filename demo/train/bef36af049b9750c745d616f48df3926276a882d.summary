@entity0 -- protesters poured onto the streets of @entity0 late wednesday , upset over a grand jury 's decision not to indict a police officer in the death of @entity8			1
they marched at the same time @entity10 attorney general @entity9 announced that federal officials were moving ahead with a civil rights investigation			2
@entity8 , an unarmed black man , died in july after a white officer , @entity13 , put him in a chokehold			1
@entity8 's death was later ruled a homicide			1
" this fight ai n't over			0
i 'm determined to get justice for my husband because he should n't have been killed in that way			0
he should n't have been killed in any way , " said @entity23 , his widow			0
" he should be here , celebrating @entity27 and @entity28 and everything else , with his children and his grandchildren			0
why ? because a cop did wrong			0
somebody that gets paid to do right did wrong and he 's not held accountable for it			2
but my husband 's death will not be in vain			0
as long as i have a breath in my body i will fight the fight till the end			0
" protesters gathered at various points in @entity46 , including @entity47 and @entity48 , marching peacefully north as crowds formed near @entity50 for the lighting of the christmas tree			0
@entity53 was blocked for a time			0
there were demonstrations in other cities too , including @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , @entity60			0
no peace , " protesters chanted in @entity0			1
" @entity8 's mother , who spoke alongside his widow , said she was disappointed by the grand jury 's decision			1
" we want you to rally , but rally in peace			0
make a statement , but make it in peace , " said @entity73			2
on @entity0 's @entity79 , a group of protesters stood face to face with rows of police officers , shouting , " i ca n't breathe , i ca n't breathe			1
" the protesters sat down on the road , crying out , " what do we want ? justice			0
when do we want it ? now ! " " @entity91 is everywhere , " one demonstrator 's sign read , referring to the @entity90 shooting in @entity91 , @entity92			0
' i ca n't breathe ' during the fatal encounter july 17 on @entity95 , @entity8 raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him			2
seconds later , a video shows an officer behind @entity8 grab him in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk , rolling him onto his stomach			1
" i ca n't breathe ! i ca n't breathe ! " @entity8 said repeatedly , his cries muffled into the pavement			2
@entity8 , 43 , was pronounced dead that day			2
police had suspected @entity8 of selling cigarettes illegally			2
the grand jury was made up of 14 white and nine nonwhite members , according to law enforcement sources			1
a total of 12 jurors who have heard all the evidence must be in agreement for a decision			0
the grand jury found that there was no " reasonable cause " to indict			1
the case became emblematic of longstanding tensions between police and minority communities , especially given that the majority of people stopped under the former " stop - and - frisk " police policy were @entity131 or @entity132			0
a federal court ruled that stop - and - frisk was unconstitutional and tantamount to racial profiling			0
the @entity8 death led to demonstrations around the city and came weeks before the racially charged police shooting of @entity90 , who was unarmed , in @entity91			1
' national moment of grief " president @entity143 said the @entity8 case reflected a longtime " concern on the part of too many minority communities that law enforcement is not working with them , and dealing with them in a fair way			2
" " we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust , and a strengthening of the accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement , " he said			0
standing outside the @entity95 store where his son was put into a fatal chokehold , @entity8 's father , @entity159 , told a crowd that he was hopeful about the federal investigation and urged demonstrators to remain peaceful			1
" we want justice for @entity8 , " he said			2
" we ai n't tearing up nothing			0
we ai n't burning up nothing ... the police is our problem			0
that is all i ask			0
" mayor @entity173 sought to allay tensions , saying that he had received assurances from @entity57 that the federal investigation of @entity8 's death would move forward " expeditiously and with a clear sense of independence			1
" @entity180 said the grand jury decision has created " a national moment of pain , a national moment of grief and searching for a solution			1
" @entity13 , according to a statement from his union , the @entity187 , said : " i became a police officer to help people and to protect those who ca n't protect themselves			1
it is never my intention to harm anyone and i feel very bad about the death of mr. @entity8			2
my family and i include him and his family in our prayers and i hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss			0
" @entity95 district attorney @entity204 said the grand jury conducted dozens of interviews with witnesses , including 22 civilians , and met between september 29 and december 3			1
an attorney for @entity210 said his client testified for approximately two hours on november 21 in front of the grand jury			1
@entity10 rep. @entity213 , who represents parts of @entity215 and @entity216 , called the decision " a miscarriage of justice " an " outrage " and a " disgrace			2
" " he was killed in plain sight for all of @entity10 to see because this was captured on video			2
and so it 's inexplicable that this grand jury could not return a single charge , " said @entity213			1
@entity187 president @entity228 said , " there are no winners " from the grand jury decision			1
" it is clear that the officer 's intention was to do nothing more than take mr. @entity8 into custody as instructed and that he used the take - down technique that he learned in the academy when mr. @entity8 refused , " @entity228 said			1
" no police officer starts a shift intending to take another human being 's life and we are all saddened by this tragedy			1
" @entity90 and @entity8 the grand jury 's decision came on the same day that the @entity105 , in an attempt to bolster public confidence , announced plans to start having some officers wear body cameras			1
" when something happens , to have a video record of it , from the police officers ' perspective , is going to help in many , many ways , " de @entity173 told reporters			0
" and @entity259 forbid , when something goes wrong , we are going to have a clearer understanding of what happened			0
" parallels mark the deaths of @entity8 and @entity90 , both black , starting with crimes they were suspected of : @entity90 allegedly stole cigars from a convenience store ; @entity8 was allegedly selling cigarettes tax - free			2
another similarity that has become the hallmark of protests in @entity91 : @entity8 put his hands up in the air , as the crook of @entity210 's elbow tightened around his throat			1
some eyewitnesses have said @entity90 also made that gesture in surrender			0
but other witnesses contradicted them			0
no video was rolling , so doubts over that and other details will always hang over the moment that former ferguson police officer @entity288 shot the unarmed teen			1
that has led @entity143 to call for law officers all over the country to record their operations with body cameras			0
in @entity8 's case , there can be little doubt what happened			1
before he gasped what appeared to be his final breaths , someone hit record on a cell phone camera			0
the details of his takedown spread through the internet as the video went viral			0
@entity288 and @entity13 in the @entity91 case , @entity288 argued before the @entity92 grand jury that he shot @entity90 -- who @entity288 said tried to wrest away his gun and then charged at him -- in self - defense			1
in the @entity95 cell phone video , @entity8 did not go after @entity210 but had his back to him ; the officer jumped him from behind then tackled him to the ground			2
the @entity0 medical examiner has ruled @entity8 's death a homicide			1
the cause of death was " compression of neck ( chokehold ) , compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police			2
" but the medical examiner also listed acute and chronic bronchial asthma , obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors in @entity8 's death			1
in @entity91 , @entity288 went into hiding after death threats and kept his status of police officer but was placed on leave			1
he resigned shortly after the grand jury decision			1
after the chokehold , @entity210 was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation , and the @entity105 's commissioner ordered an extensive review of training procedures			1
two lawsuits have previously been filed against @entity210			0
the plaintiffs in both suits allege false arrest , unlawful imprisonment , civil rights violations and other charges			0
one suit from 2013 was dismissed in january 2014 , while the second , from february 2014 , remains open			0
@entity91 and @entity0 in both @entity91 and @entity0 , mostly @entity131 protesters took to the streets for weeks after both men died to decry police violence			1
demonstrators in @entity0 have called the police response during @entity8 's arrest excessive and criminal , but during protests , the contact between police and demonstrators has been largely cordial			1
missing were the tear gas canisters , assault rifles , armored vehicles and the lootings and flying bottles that marred the @entity374 suburb in the wake of @entity90 's death			0
when the @entity92 grand jury declined to charge @entity288 , violence returned to @entity91 , as shot were fired , stores were looted and cars were set on fire			2
@entity1 's @entity383 , @entity384 , @entity385 , @entity386 , @entity387 and @entity388 contributed to this report .			0
