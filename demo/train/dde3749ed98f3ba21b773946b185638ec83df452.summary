@entity0 , @entity1 -- thirty - three people have now died from the @entity6 coronavirus , the @entity3 said friday			1
three new cases , including a fatality , were recorded in @entity10 , the kingdom announced this week			2
another previously reported @entity10 patient also died from the disease , which lacks a cure or vaccine			1
globally , there have been 58 laboratory - confirmed cases of @entity6 , and all have been linked to the @entity18			1
a statement from the @entity10 @entity20 said one of three new cases was a 21 - year - old man who died after being admitted into intensive care this week			1
health officials have n't revealed more details about the young man or whether he had an underlying health condition			0
the majority of serious illness and deaths have been seen in old , already sick men			0
the other two cases , according to the health ministry , were in @entity10 's eastern governorate of @entity35 , where most cases of the disease have appeared			2
one is a 63 - year - old @entity10 woman who is in stable condition ; a 75 - year - old man remains in intensive care			0
the @entity10 ministry announcement wednesday came a day after the ministry said it had made progress in its research to combat the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) outbreak			1
studies carried out by researchers from @entity10 and the @entity50 have allowed them to map out the genetic characteristics of the @entity6 virus , the health ministry said in a statement			1
this is considered " a positive step to follow - up the development and mutation of the virus over the time , meanwhile , helping in the diagnostic steps , and to find out a quick mechanism of diagnoses , " the ministry said			2
the research was conducted in collaboration with scientists from @entity66 and the @entity67			0
a full genetic series , obtained from four infected cases in @entity35 , was recorded in the gene bank , said ministry spokesman dr. @entity71			1
the series is also available to the public on the @entity76 website			0
the ministry said it " hopes that this step to contribute to the scientific development ; so as to accelerate finding out a vaccine for this disease , and to learn more about this the virus , since there is hardly current information about it up to now , nor there is a vaccine or treatment for it			2
" the @entity90 said it is " important that the @entity10 released the sequences			0
it helps us understand the virologic evidence of person - to - person transmission			0
" the virus could be adapting to better grow and cause disease in humans , said dr. @entity98 , a professor of pediatrics and longtime coronavirus researcher at @entity101			0
releasing the genetic sequences from four more patients and making them publicly available is essential for allowing researchers around the world to study this emerging disease			1
researchers can now start comparing the genetic sequences from these four recent @entity10 patients to the genetic sequence from the first @entity10 patient , which is also publicly available , he said			2
" it may give us insights into why the epidemic is continuing " and whether the virus is changing			0
while the overall number of cases is limited , @entity6 has been fatal in more than half of patients , according to the @entity3			1
despite concerns about this new virus , there is " no evidence of widespread person - to - person transmission , " according tothe @entity3			1
cases where it was passed from person to person resulted from close contact between an infected person and someone else			0
in addition , fewer @entity6 infections have been seen in health care workers than during the sars epidemic , the @entity3 said			1
but the international organization called for caution , saying it is possible for the virus to move around the world			0
@entity2 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity3 says 58 cases of @entity6 have been reported ; *33* have died
researchers have mapped the genetic characteristics of the virus
while cases are limited , @entity6 has *killed* more than half of its *victims*
