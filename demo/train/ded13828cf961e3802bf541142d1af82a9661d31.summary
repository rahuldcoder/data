-- a federal appeals court on monday affirmed a previous injunction of @entity4 's controversial immigration law , another setback for legislation that has drawn sharp opposition from president @entity9 's administration			1
in its ruling , a three - judge panel on the @entity11 sided with the @entity13 and against @entity4 gov. @entity14 , who signed the measure known as @entity16 into law last year			1
among other things , this legislation would have required local law enforcement in @entity4 to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants			2
the @entity9 administration sued , arguing that only the federal government has that authority			0
that lawsuit led to @entity28 district judge @entity27 's decision last july , which temporarily blocked the law 's most contested parts just a day before they were scheduled to go into effect			1
that included the requirement that local police officers should check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws			0
monday 's decision came more than five months after both sides presented their cases in @entity41 to the federal appeals court judges			1
the ruling was written by federal judge @entity44 and supported in full by judge @entity45			0
judge @entity46 partially concurred and partially dissented from the ruling opinion			0
" we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion , " the ruling states			2
" therefore , we affirm the district court 's preliminary injunction order enjoining these certain provisions of @entity16			1
" @entity4 's governor and attorney general will now consider " their legal options , " according to a statement , including possibly an immediate petition to the @entity28 @entity59			1
@entity14 claimed monday in this statement that the latest decision " does harm to the safety and well - being of @entity64 who suffer the negative effects of illegal immigration			1
" " for decades , the federal government has neglected its constitutional duty to @entity28 citizens by failing to secure the border , " she said			2
" states like @entity4 have borne the brunt of that failure			2
" those on the other side of the issue , including key figures in @entity4 's immigrant community , applauded the ruling			1
' what this decision says is that governor @entity14 is wrong , " @entity85 , an activist group focused on promoting social justice and equal rights for immigrant communities in @entity4 , told reporters monday			1
" this decision shows a victory on the side of justice and it shows that civil rights prevails			0
" the ruling is the biproduct of a lawsuit filed by the @entity13 that challenged six of the @entity4 law 's provisions , meaning other parts of the law went into effect in july			1
that includes a ban on " sanctuary cities " : municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants			0
@entity112 's ruling also allowed a provision making it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic			2
in addition , the ruling allowed parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants			0
@entity126 lawmakers , @entity128 sheriff @entity127 and other state governments were among those filing briefs with the appeals court supporting @entity4 's argument			1
the @entity134 government , the @entity133 , the @entity133 and the city of @entity136 , @entity4 , were among those filing briefs supporting the @entity13 's side			2
in its lawsuit , the @entity13 challenged only six of the @entity4 law 's provisions , meaning others went into effect in july			1
that includes a ban on " sanctuary cities " : municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants			0
@entity112 's ruling also allowed a provision making it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic			0
in addition , the ruling allowed parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants			0
the decision monday sides with the @entity13 , largely on the argument that federal immigration policy would be greatly undermined -- as might @entity28 's standing in the world -- if individual states adopted their own separate immigration laws			2
doing so , the ruling contends , equates to a given state adopting its own foreign policy , one that may be in opposition to national policy			0
" that 50 individual states or one individual state should have a foreign policy is absurdity too gross to be entertained			0
in matters affecting the intercourse of the federal nation with other nations , the federal nation must speak with one voice , " the ruling says			0
@entity14 , along with attorney general @entity183 , on monday said the appeals court relied too much on testimony from " foreign governments , " calling it wrong to give such nations " the de facto right to veto the duly - enacted laws of a sovereign state of the @entity28			1
" in his partial dissent -- which represents his opinion , but does not equate to law -- @entity194 contended that local and state officers do have a role in addressing federal immigration laws			0
" @entity199 intended that state officers be free to inquire of the federal officers into the immigration status of any person , without any direction or supervision of such federal officers -- and the federal officers ' shall respond ' to any such inquiry , " he writes			0
in february , @entity14 announced that @entity4 had filed a countersuit against the federal government , seeking the authority to implement its own border security efforts			2
at that time , @entity214 spokesman @entity213 called @entity4 's court claim a " meritless " one that " does nothing to secure the border			1

new : an immigrant activist says , " this decisions says *...* gov. @entity14 is wrong "
@entity14 says the ruling harms " the safety and well - being of @entity64 "
@entity28 appeals court judges on monday affirm an earlier ruling on @entity4 's @entity16
that ruling had blocked key provisions of the law , just before they became law
