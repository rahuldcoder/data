-- last year , at @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , an @entity4 teacher at the school and the son of the @entity8 - winning historian @entity3 , gave the commencement address			1
he knocked it out of the park , and his words traveled far			2
what he had to say , @entity14 was desperate to hear			2
@entity16 believes that much of today 's youth is " pampered , cosseted , doted upon , helmeted , bubble - wrapped " and shielded from reality			2
he told the graduates : " climb the mountain not to plant your flag , but to embrace the challenge , enjoy the air and behold the view			1
climb it so you can see the world , not so the world can see you			2
" i 've had the privilege of delivering a commencement address , at a university in central @entity34 , and i hope someday to deliver another			2
in fact , i already know what i want to say			2
so let me try it out on the class of 2013			2
talk to college professors or human resource managers or employers			1
read the research done on the so - called millennial generation , and you 'll find lots of evidence that @entity16 was on the right track			1
the young people of today have often spent their lives being coddled , catered to and spared the stress of living up to expectations			1
people usually tell them only what they want to hear			1
@entity54 to new grads : " no time for excuses " not me			2
i 'd rather tell our future leaders what they need to hear			2
here are 10 provocative pieces of advice that this year 's class of college and university graduates would be wise to take to heart : 1 ) have your parents introduce themselves to you			1
interview them , and record it			2
ask them about their lives , and what stories or lessons they 'd like to share with their grandchildren			2
they gave you life , so the least you can do is try to understand theirs			1
when they 're gone , you 'll be glad you did			1
2 ) follow your passion but be open to the idea that your passion might change and evolve over the years as you do			0
do n't be afraid to change course and go in a different direction			0
you 're allowed to have second thoughts , about what you want to do and how you intend to spend your life			1
3 ) never forget that , despite what society has told you , you 're not special , as @entity16 said in his graduation speech			1
the world does n't revolve around you			0
and you must n't feel entitled to anything			1
no one is better than you , but you 're not better than anyone else			1
treat everyone with respect , as long as they treat you the same way			0
4 ) break out of your comfort zone			1
do what you 're most afraid of			1
avoid what is easy and predictable			0
travel the country and the world			0
meet new people and strive to see the world from their vantage point			1
5 ) do n't just accept failure , but welcome it			0
treat it as a valuable learning experience			0
remember , if you always get everything you want , and accomplish everything you set out to do , then you 've failed anyway			0
because you 've set your goals too low			0
6 ) question authority and challenge your beliefs			0
jump into the public debate			0
democracy is a participatory sport ; you take part , or you get taken apart			0
it does n't matter what you believe			0
what matters is that you thought your way there and can explain why you believe it			0
7 ) for those of you who choose , or are able , to get married -- and hopefully , one day , all of you will be -- who you decide to marry will go a long way toward determining your success			0
it 's more important than degrees from fancy schools			0
people can either lift you up , or bring you down			1
8 ) for those who you who choose , or are able , to have children , when you set to raise them , give them the one thing they want most : your time			0
teach them to be productive			0
but more importantly , teach them , by example , to be good people , who treat fellow human beings kindly and with respect			1
9 ) as you go through life , do n't be afraid to have high expectations of your children , of others , and of yourself			1
there are worse things than being disappointed because someone did n't perform as you hoped			0
like giving up on them and not expecting much from the beginning			0
10 ) finally , many years from now , when you go to your rest , your most important accomplishment in life wo n't be the money you earned or the success you enjoyed			1
the only thing that will endure , and let the world know you were here in the first place , is the impact you had on other people			1
make it a positive one			0
take it , or leave it			0
everyone enjoys the comfort of a warm bath			1
but sometimes , what 's called for is a cold shower			0
