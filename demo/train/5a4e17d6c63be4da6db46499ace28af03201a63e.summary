editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose new book is " @entity5 : a @entity6			1
" @entity2 says ordinary life stops when @entity8 appears anywhere			1
( @entity3 ) -- it was still early enough in the evening that the main dinner crowd had not yet started to show up ; the restaurant , east of @entity13 in @entity14 , was less than half - filled			1
the party of 10 at the table by the front window had arrived promptly for their 6 p.m. reservation			2
nine of the 10 studied their menus , but the 10th , the man at the head of the table , did not			2
@entity8 , 67 , stared down toward the white tablecloth and drew on a piece of paper			1
he sketched a picture of a mountain			2
there are a handful of men among us who , simply by appearing out of nowhere , make other men and women pause involuntarily to consider the long paths of their own lives			2
it is as if these men have always been with us , and if you should unexpectedly spot @entity42 in an airport , if you should see @entity44 walking through a hotel lobby , if you should encounter @entity46 entering an office building , it will bring you up short			0
it 's like opening a diary , even if you have never met them , even if you have never seen them except on a television set or a movie screen			1
yet @entity8 is different even from them			1
@entity8 -- his story so complicated , his health failing , his imprint on the world so indelible -- makes people mist up the moment they lay eyes on him			1
it was happening tonight inside this restaurant called the @entity64 ; diners at their own tables , not quite sure for a second that they were really seeing what they were seeing , let their gazes linger and could not look away			2
the other men and women at his table -- this was a gathering of family and friends to celebrate a birthday , and @entity8 had come into @entity14 from his farm in @entity13 -- talked animatedly and laughed			1
he wore a blue - and - white @entity78 - style shirt ; someone had tucked a white napkin into the space above the top button			0
over the speaker system of the restaurant , a slowed - down acoustic knockoff of the old @entity84 hit " @entity87 " was playing softly : " she 's a good girl , crazy ' bout @entity89 ... " a family , across the way , talked spiritedly among themselves			1
the father and the children stood up			0
from the ceiling , the song : " ... and i 'm free , free fallin ' ... " they walked over to @entity8 's table			1
" we apologize for the intrusion , " the father said			0
@entity8 looked toward them , showing a gentle expression			1
the father had a camera			0
he said to his children : " this is the most famous face in the world			0
" it is difficult to know what the children made of this			0
youth and strength and beauty are so fleeting			1
the man in the @entity78 shirt once embodied all of those things , before these children were born			2
three times the world heavyweight boxing champion , the center of global fascination and frenzied controversy after winning his first title and then changing his name from @entity8 , endlessly mesmerizing with his float - like - a - butterfly , sting - like - a - bee ring style , called " the greatest of all time " so often that the words became almost an official designation , the sight of his flawless face and the sound of his confident - beyond - all - dispute voice a sustaining part of the very atmosphere			1
... but his road has turned hard , and here were these children , who were not around for any of that , standing with their father next to the table			0
@entity8 's family members and friends said it would be all right for the father to take some photos , so he did			1
when he left , @entity8 went back to his drawing			1
more diners were beginning to arrive at the restaurant			2
their evenings changed the moment they caught sight of him			0
some pulled out cell phones to call people across the nation ; others quietly debated whether to approach him			0
many years ago , i traveled the country with him to prepare a magazine profile for a special issue on the 50 men and women judged to have had the greatest impact on society during their time on @entity171			0
everywhere @entity8 went , he was mobbed ; people grabbed at him , people cried out , people attempted to touch his face			1
in the middle of all this one day , he said to me , almost in a whisper : " this is the whole world			0
this is what my whole life is like			2
" that has n't changed , although his ability to speak aloud about it has			0
the food began to arrive at his table			0
the people to his right and to his left helped him with his			0
he demonstrated not the least sliver of self - consciousness ; this is part of his life now , and he knows how much he is loved			2
he handed something to a man named @entity191 , who has been his friend for 50 years			0
it was a drawing that a young girl had brought over to him earlier			0
she had made a picture of a butterfly and had presented it to him			0
now @entity8 gave it to @entity191 , who took it across the restaurant to where the child was sitting with her family			1
@entity8 had signed his name to it			1
@entity191 handed it to the little girl			0
outside the restaurant , on @entity209 , a group of young men walked by , wearing officially licensed jerseys bearing the names and uniform numbers of their favorite current - day sports stars			2
one of the young men glanced through the windowpane but did not register that the man at whom he was looking was @entity8			1
@entity8 studied the tablecloth , and a birthday cake arrived , and the others at the table began to sing in the direction of one woman among them : " happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you ... " @entity8 did not sing nor did he look up			1
but then the others reached the penultimate line of the song : " happy birthday , dear @entity234 ... " and with that @entity8 lifted his head and gazed directly at her , right into her eyes , and smiled the most luminous smile toward her			1
" ... happy birthday to you			0
" soon they rose to depart			0
some in the restaurant , now more crowded , applauded			2
and then he was out on the street and in a moment out of sight			0
around the next corner , although they did not yet know it , people would soon be stopping in their tracks			0
he may be the only one who remembers his life when it was any other way			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity8 embodied youth , strength and beauty in his *remarkable* *career*
he says @entity8 drew attention of everyone in a @entity14 restaurant
