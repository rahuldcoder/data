-- in short , it was n't the return @entity3 had hoped for			1
making his first competitive outing since missing the cut at the @entity6 in august , @entity3 posted a five - over par 77 in the first round at the @entity8 at @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity11			1
the 14 - time major champion , who has struggled with a back injury all year , got off to the worst possible start with three bogeys and a double bogey in the opening nine holes			1
a birdie -- his only one of the day -- came at the par four 12th hole , but was immediately canceled out at the next hole with a bogey six where , incredibly , he took three chips to get his ball onto the green			2
" today , it was weird , i did n't feel like i hit it that bad , " @entity3 told reporters			1
" my short game was awful , and i did n't make anything			2
it certainly is surprising that i could hit chips that poorly			0
just flubbed them , " he added			0
" i felt comfortable on a lot of the chip shots this week as i was playing practice rounds off the tighter spots			2
but when it got a little grainier , just was n't as good as i needed it to be			0
" @entity42 ' round left him lying in last place in the 18 - man tournament , four shots off compatriots @entity48 and @entity49 who are tied for 16th and a distant 11 shots off first - round leader @entity51			1
the attention surrounding @entity42 ' return has been heightened after he announced at the end of last month that he had hired @entity55 as his new swing " consultant			1
" @entity55 replaces coach @entity58 , who parted ways with @entity3 in august after a four - year partnership that yielded eight victories but crucially no major titles			1
with @entity55 it could be a case of back to the future			1
@entity3 said he was " excited " by what the 36 - year - old , whose has previously coached @entity67 @entity66 , is bringing to his game			1
" it is new , but it is old , " @entity3 said earlier this week			1
" we looked at a lot of video from when i was a junior -- even when i came out there and had some really nice years where i hit the ball really well			0
we went back to some of those old videos and really looked at it			0
" and it was quite interesting to see where my swing was then and how much force i could generate with a very skinny frame			2
how did i do that ? how do i generate that much power ? that 's kind of what we are getting back into			0
@entity3 hinted that the changes may already be taking effect			1
" i do n't feel like i 'm hitting it very hard			0
but it 's coming off the face faster , " he said			0
according to @entity95 , @entity55 has been studying for a master 's degree in biomechanics at @entity99 , working under dr. @entity100			1
adopting a less stressful way of striking the ball could finally allow the 38 - year - old to build up a competitive head of steam -- his tour appearances have been increasingly sporadic in recent seasons			2
despite undergoing back surgery to rectify a pinched nerve in april , @entity3 has struggled to regain full fitness and has played just seven tournaments in all this year			1
an acceptance of his physical restrictions that age brings about may also help @entity3 , once the longest hitter on tour			1
" i ca n't blow it out there with some of the longer guys any more			0
back when i was younger a long ball was 290 [ yards ] in the air			0
that was a big ball			0
now it 's 320 , 325			0
that 's the new standard out here , " he told reporters earlier this week			0
but he refuses to right off his chances of competing consistently at the highest level in the years ahead			0
" you can win at a very late age because you do n't have to physically dominate anybody , you just have to beat the golf course , " he said earlier this week			2
" and it is one of the reasons why you saw @entity137 win at age 54 , looked like @entity138 [ @entity139 ] was going to win the @entity140 at 59 and @entity141 [ @entity142 ] was part of the lead in the @entity140 when he was 54			2
" i 'm not quite 40 yet so i 've still got some time			0

@entity3 shoots a *disappointing* five - over 77 after four - month injury layoff
woods down in last place 11 shots off lead held by @entity51
former world *no.* 1 recently announced new swing coach @entity55
@entity3 says new swing is " new , but old " and perhaps less physically *taxing* on body
