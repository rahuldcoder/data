-- one of the areas in which president @entity2 has held a consistent lead in polls over @entity6 presidential nominee @entity5 is in the handling of foreign affairs			0
although the killing of @entity11 surely factors into this , @entity2 's advantage stems from progress on his signature promises to bring the troops home from @entity16 and @entity17 and reduce @entity19 's oversized , and overly costly , military footprint in the world			1
although the recent attacks on @entity19 diplomatic compounds in the @entity24 might have offered @entity5 an opportunity to broach foreign policy issues , the tensions only underscore the appeal of @entity2 's foreign policy to a war - weary public : " after a decade of war , the nation we need to be rebuilding is the @entity19 , " he said in an address last month at @entity35 , @entity36			1
even @entity5 , who has been harshly critical of the president 's foreign policy leadership , seems unwilling to contest this political reality ; he omitted any mention of @entity16 or @entity17 in his acceptance speech last month in @entity42 , @entity43			0
but the question is not whether promises to bring home troops and reduce military spending can be sold in an election year -- the question is what impact would retrenchment have on future @entity19 and global security			1
if history is any guide , the answer is troubling : over the past century , each of @entity19 's attempts to reduce its role in the world was met by rising global threats , eventually requiring a major @entity19 re-engagement			1
this is not to argue that the @entity19 should sustain its muscular post- 9/11 global posture or continue its land war in @entity17			1
it is to urge caution against a growing belief that scaling back @entity19 power in the world will be without risks or costs			1
history shows that in the aftermath of @entity19 's major wars of the 20th century -- @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 -- the @entity19 public and powerful leaders in @entity78 demanded strict new limits in foreign policy			2
after @entity73 , that meant rejecting participation in the @entity83 and receding into isolation			0
after @entity74 , it meant embarking on one of the largest voluntary military demobilizations in world history			2
and after @entity75 , it meant placing new restrictions on a president 's ability to conduct overseas operations			0
but in each case , hopes were soon dashed by global challengers who took advantage of @entity19 's effort to draw back from the world stage -- @entity103 and @entity104 in the 1930s , the @entity100 in the immediate @entity102 period and the @entity100 again after @entity75			1
in each case , the @entity19 was forced back into a paramount global leadership role -- in @entity74 , the @entity106 and the military build - up and proxy wars of the 1980s			1
similar effects have also followed the withdrawal of @entity19 troops from global hot spots , as in @entity115 in 1993			1
@entity19 's need to extricate itself from that calamitous humanitarian mission , in which 18 @entity19 soldiers were killed , was clear			2
but the withdrawal came at a huge strategic cost : it emboldened the narrative of the emerging @entity124 network that @entity19 was a " paper tiger , " setting the stage for the escalating terrorist attacks of the 1990s and september 11 , 2001			2
@entity2 's desire to withdraw from costly and unpopular foreign conflicts and refocus on domestic issues is understandable			1
and he is by no means an isolationist , as his intensified war on @entity124 can attest			0
but @entity2 's assertion that his recalibration of @entity19 foreign policy -- centered on withdrawing @entity19 troops from @entity24 wars and leaning more on allies and the @entity137 -- has awakened " a new confidence in our leadership " is without foundation			1
like @entity143 in the 19th century , @entity19 since the turn of the 20th century has been the world 's pivotal global power			2
fair or not , in moments when @entity19 seemed unsure of its role in the world , the world noticed and reacted			2
there is no reason to believe now is different			0
indeed , in many ways looming opportunists are more obvious today than the 1930s , 1970s and 1990s			0
these include @entity124 and other @entity157 movements spinning @entity19 troop withdrawals from @entity16 and @entity17 as strategic defeats ; an emboldened @entity160 on the cusp of attaining nuclear weapons ; and a rising @entity163 flexing its muscles in the @entity165			0
to his credit , @entity5 has strongly warned against a world with more limited @entity19 leadership			1
he has also promised to reverse @entity2 's defense cuts and offer his own increases			0
but while @entity2 's approach may be shortsighted , @entity5 's would face an uphill battle against fiscal and popular sentiment			0
these issues must certainly be raised in the upcoming presidential debates			0
whoever wins in november will confront not just an increasingly dangerous world , but also an increasingly isolationist public			0
the great challenge will be to convince the @entity19 people that robust @entity19 leadership in the world remains vital to their security and prosperity and convince the world it remains unwavering			1
history shows that doing otherwise only raises the stakes down the line			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			0

@entity190 : @entity19 are sick of war and ready to focus on domestic issues
withdrawing troops , cutting military might be popular , but it is not without risks , he says
@entity190 : historically , each time @entity19 drew back militarily , global challengers took advantage
he says @entity19 must believe in @entity19 leadership ; world must know @entity19 is steadfast
