@entity1 's leading women want to be treated with a little more respect as they parade the red carpet on @entity6 night this sunday			1
and it 's not hard to sympathize with them			2
female nominees , it seems , are tired of simply engaging in the same old small talk about the make of their gowns , the jewels they are wearing , or the footwear they 're flaunting ( not to mention the intimate secrets of their personal beautification process )			2
so they have been pushing back in the form of # @entity21 , a campaign launched last year that 's being waged by women in @entity1 wanting to broaden the scope of their pre-telecast conversations beyond fashion			2
whether it be @entity28 's pointed question to a cameraman at last year 's @entity30 , or contenders refusing to raise their hands for @entity33 @entity38 's " @entity37 , " actresses are starting to speak out about some of the more sexist treatment they face			2
so , can we expect a red carpet rebellion at this year 's @entity6 ? far from it			1
posing like a supermodel and discussing couture delivers a big payoff -- a lucrative contract representing a luxury brand of cosmetics , watches , automobiles or even bottled water and automobiles			1
such contracts give stars an extra income , allowing them to refrain , if they choose , from making b - list movies or popcorn blockbusters			2
plus , fronting a glossy campaign can also create a sophisticated aura around the star in question			2
and this award season has felt even longer than usual			2
instead of kicking off with january 's @entity62 , it started two months early , in november 2014 , with the @entity63			2
purists lampooned the telecast , which despite proclaiming itself the " official launch of the @entity68 " has seemed barely known to much of the public beyond @entity1			0
yet that did n't stop the talent considered a shoo - in for the big prizes from being out in force at the ceremony , gamely fielding pre-telecast questions from film and fashion reporters			1
and this week , the @entity6 front - runners are still talking fashion , despite the word on the ground here in @entity84 being that some nominees are nursing colds , while others already have blisters from walking miles of red carpet in their borrowed designer stilettos			1
for some , it seems , the thinking is # @entity21 be damned ! it did n't used to be like this			0
serious actors -- especially those intent on winning an @entity6 -- once refrained from the " grubby " work of advertising			1
@entity101 's decision to promote health clubs in a series of tv commercials , for example , was seen by many as scuttling her shot as best actress for the 1985 film " @entity109			0
" if an actor did decide to promote a brand , he or she would generally do so on the sly , in @entity113 , and pocket big money out of sight of @entity117 audiences ( much easier in the @entity119 era )			1
today there is no such stigma			0
last year 's red carpet star @entity122 , who secured a statuette for " 12 years a slave , " got an early jump on the @entity6 buzz - generating action at the @entity129 in august before embarking on a six - month stretch of appearances in which she seemed to divide her time between film industry functions ( which allow for networking opportunities with @entity6 voters ) and fashion goings - on			1
on the day her @entity62 nomination was announced , for example , @entity122 was attending the @entity140 couture shows			0
a month after @entity122 claimed the best supporting actress @entity6 , @entity142 announced she would be one of its brand ambassadors			1
this is all a far cry from the days when the shoe was on the other foot , and it was old @entity1 's leading women who felt honored to be associated with their stylists			0
golden age stars like @entity151 and @entity152 were proud of their associations with style gurus like @entity155 and @entity156 -- and they also paid for their clothes -- while @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 relied on @entity162 , the head of the costume department at @entity164 , to prep them for awards - season premieres and the @entity6			1
similarly , on her way to winning the best actress prize for " caberet " in 1973 , @entity167 sought out the services of design legend @entity172 , reportedly to ensure that she would have an image that would keep her out of the shadow of her legendary mother , @entity175			0
@entity172 's reported advice ? @entity167 should purchase a set of @entity180 luggage , which he then filled with clothes , footwear and jewels all made to measure for her			0
still , for a time , the demise of the studio system and feminist ideals started to put paid to women prettifying themselves ( too much ) for awards season			0
indeed , a slew of late 1970s and ' 80s winners sported pantsuits and cocktail attire at the @entity62 and the @entity6			1
but @entity195 's reasoning that " if you are going to the @entity6 , you might as well go to the @entity6 " may have marked a resurgence of glamor			1
onetime model @entity199 liked fashion and understood how to wear fine jewelry			0
and today , her successors on the nominations list , actresses like @entity28 , @entity204 and @entity205 -- respected both for their style and talent -- carry her torch			0
and increasingly , male leads seem interested in getting in on the act			0
@entity216 , up for best actor for " @entity215 , " has been a regular presence at events on tv			0
and although he has n't been nominated for an @entity6 , @entity220 of " boyhood " has been working the style angle , becoming a red carpet star and the face of @entity226 's coming - of - age epic			1
and like @entity227 , whose claim to fame prior to " @entity231 " was an @entity233 show , @entity220 has shot to overnight stardom			0
clad in sharp @entity236 tuxedos and plush velvet @entity238 suits , he has gamely chatted his way through @entity33 pre-telecasts			0
so if you tune in on sunday , do n't expect the stars to be camera - shy , even if they are cringing inside at the questions they are being asked			1
after all , while some of them will be collecting awards for work already completed , the @entity6 pre-show is also a chance for many of them to be auditioning for some more work -- whether it 's on the silver screen or a magazine cover			1
and for that reason alone , the red carpet circus is n't going anywhere .			0
