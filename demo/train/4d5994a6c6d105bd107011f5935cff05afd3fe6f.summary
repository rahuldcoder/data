@entity1 's hot new anthology drama @entity2 opened solid in the ratings sunday night , while comedy girls returned to a series - high audience			1
despite facing the @entity8 , @entity1 's freshman drama debut had 2.3 million viewers — the biggest @entity1 series opening since @entity11 in 2010 , and just barely edging out the series premiere of @entity13 from 2011			1
true detective 's first replay added another million viewers to the tally			2
true detective stars @entity19 and @entity20 as @entity22 detectives hunting a serial killer			2
check out @entity25 's in - depth analysis of the first episode			0
meanwhile @entity27 returned to a series - high 1.1 million viewers , up 28 percent from the season 2 debut			0
guess that @entity33 question # ragespiral fight about @entity35 's nudity did n't hurt the show 's popularity ( and might have even helped )			0
though it might seem odd to launch a sophisticated premium drama like true detective against an event like the @entity8 , the awards show draws fewer viewers than a major prime - time football game — which is what @entity1 faces most weeks this time of year			1
also , true detective feels like a show that 's likely to grow even more in the coming weeks			1
