-- after the inquisition , the exhibition -- or an exhibition game at the very least			2
at the @entity6 in @entity7 , those who once ruled the world took their first steps towards redemption			1
call it pigeon steps but this was more evolution rather than revolution			0
while a new generation of @entity18 players may have taken to the field , the result proved to be the same			0
not one single shot on target and only a few fleeting moments of encouragement , this will not be a night where those who had hoped for progress will feel reassured			0
@entity29 's 73rd minute strike condemned @entity30 to defeat as those in red struggled to escape the shadow which has been cast upon them since their chastening @entity36 experience			1
it was on a friday night on june 20 inside @entity39 's iconic @entity38 where the football 's landscape shifted in a seismic measure which so few had predicted			2
for so long , @entity30 had danced around the world like a matador teasing a bull , showing its opponent the ball before moving it away with a style and swagger which delighted so many			1
its brand of ' tiki - taka ' brought success -- the @entity54 sandwiched in between victories at the 2008 and 2012 @entity57 finals			2
but in @entity59 it imploded			0
the warning signs had been there			0
the @entity62 , which was held in @entity59 12 months before the @entity36 , gave a glimpse of what was to follow			0
an embarrassing 3 - 0 defeat in the final against the host nation should have caused some sort of rethink from @entity70 , the man who has presided over the most successful period in his nation 's history			1
and yet it did not come			0
the opening @entity36 game against the @entity76 was a sobering affair -- a game in where @entity30 was fortunate to get one in a 5 - 1 defeat			1
against @entity82 , where it needed a performance to prove its doubters wrong and protect its legacy , it barely managed to raise itself beyond a whimper			0
but that episode has passed -- and those who once wore the red with such distinction have also moved on			0
@entity93 , the man whose metronomic passing allowed the supporting orchestra to perform with such an overwhelming crescendo , has retired , as too have @entity97 and @entity98			0
@entity99 , the goalkeeper who endured a dismal @entity36 , was forced to sit on the bench , while @entity101 , the @entity102 defender , was not even included in the squad			0
no , this time @entity70 gave an opportunity to those who may yet come to be @entity30 's future			1
@entity107 , the @entity109 midfielder , one of the outstanding stars of @entity113 last season , began in midfield alongside club teammate @entity115 , while @entity117 's @entity116 started in defense			2
but in a disjointed first half , it was those who were absent which perhaps emerged with greater credit			0
the genius of @entity125 , sidelined with a hip injury was sorely missed while the attacking threat posed by normal full - back @entity128 was sacrificed for the more defensive minded @entity130			2
but against a @entity6 team which will host the @entity57 finals in two years time , this new look @entity18 side struggled to create any real opportunities			1
@entity6 , which exited the @entity36 at the quarterfinal stage following a disappointing performance against eventual champion @entity138 , fielded a strong side which included @entity141 , the @entity142 forward			1
twice in the first half @entity141 tested @entity144 in the @entity18 goal but on each occasion the @entity147 man was equal to the task			2
the second half began in similar fashion to the first -- with @entity6 on top and playing a sense of freedom , a joie de vivre which @entity30 could only wish it possessed			1
@entity141 appeared to have given his side the lead after sweeping the ball home following good work by @entity161 but the offside flag dampened any celebrations			0
@entity30 made changes in the second half with the ineffective @entity165 , so lethal for @entity166 in the @entity167 , making way along with @entity169			1
but even with the introduction of @entity173 's @entity172 and @entity102 's @entity174 , the visiting side failed to create anything of note			2
and when @entity6 carved out an opportunity with 17 minutes remaining it was duly taken by @entity29 , who lashed home @entity180 's pullback from 10 - yards			1
that goal did serve to awaken @entity30 from its slumber , @entity183 firing inches wide of the far post after neat interplay with @entity174			1
it was only with the introduction of @entity183 that @entity30 looked capable of piecing something together , though when it did , the @entity190 defense stood firm			2
defeat was not only deserved but it gave the impression that @entity70 has still not solved his side 's problems			0
@entity195 awaits in @entity109 on monday in the opening qualification game for the 2016 @entity57 finals -- there can be no more room for error			0
@entity202 success elsewhere , @entity203 made a successful start to his reign as @entity202 manager with a 2 - 0 win over the @entity208 in @entity209			1
@entity210 and @entity211 scored the goals for the home side against a @entity76 team which played for 81 minutes with 10 men after @entity216 was sent off			0
in @entity218 , @entity217 became his country 's leading goalscorer after netting his 49th and 50th goals in a 2 - 0 win over @entity223			1
in @entity225 , @entity224 defeated @entity226 2 - 0 , while @entity227 overcame @entity228 2 - 0 and @entity229 eased to a 3 - 0 win over @entity231 .			1

@entity6 defeats @entity30 1 - 0 in @entity7
@entity29 scores only goal of the game
@entity202 defeats @entity208 2 - 0 in @entity209
@entity217 becomes @entity218 's record goalscorer
