-- as @entity4 and his son took the hot seat tuesday in the @entity7 , old questions about @entity3 's business practices were getting fresh scrutiny on the other side of the @entity10			1
the fallout of the @entity13 phone - hacking scandal has resulted in the arrest of 10 people , including @entity16 , a former @entity18 editor who resigned friday from her post as chief executive of @entity21 , and the resignation of @entity23 as ceo of the @entity26 unit , which publishes the @entity27			1
@entity4 's company has suffered a stock plunge , is facing questions over future leadership and is under an @entity33 investigation			1
now , the business ethos of another arm of @entity3 could deepen the controversy and raise eyebrows about the media mogul 's entire corporate culture			1
@entity40 , an in - store coupon and newspaper ad insert marketing business , has been hauled into @entity44 courts several times over unsavory practices that include hacking into the computers of competitors			1
in one of the lawsuits , @entity49 - based @entity48 charged that @entity40 attacked @entity48 directly by breaking into a password - protected computer system to acquire sensitive proprietary information , including past and future contracts			1
the company claimed it had lost several big - name contracts because of @entity40 's tactics			1
in another lawsuit , rival @entity59 described a scene from the movie " @entity64 " in which mobster @entity65 beats an enemy to death with a baseball bat			0
it said @entity70 , then the chief operating officer of @entity40 , showed the scene to his employees to get his point across : that @entity40 employees will tackle their work with " unbridled aggression			2
" " the selected scene is a perfect metaphor for the business practices both expected and in fact being employed ( by @entity40 ) to illegally leverage its market dominance , " @entity59 said in its federal lawsuit			1
in @entity84 , @entity83 filed an anti-trust claim seeking restitution for millions of dollars it said it lost because of the behavior of @entity40			2
in these cases , @entity4 's company attempted to smooth over its problems by settling lawsuits with millions of dollars and , in the case of @entity48 , buying out the company			1
the business news website @entity96 described the acquisition as " more like a face - saving gesture for @entity40 than a real deal			1
" @entity101 media columnist @entity100 reported that @entity40 has a history of solving its problems with large sums of money			2
the company , wrote @entity100 , " paid out about $ 655 million to make embarrassing charges of corporate espionage and anticompetitive behavior go away			2
" in making his point , @entity100 quoted @entity111 , the lawyer for the family of slain @entity13 girl @entity113 , whose mobile phone voice mail was hacked into by journalists			0
" this is not just about one individual but about the culture of an organization , " @entity111 said after @entity118 ' resignation			0
a @entity40 spokeswoman said the company had no comment			1
the scandal potentially could be far - reaching in @entity44			0
besides @entity26 , @entity3 also is the parent company of @entity127 , the @entity128 , and @entity130 publishers in the @entity44			1
9/11 victims some @entity44 have already reacted with outrage and shock after allegations that the phones of victims of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks were hacked as @entity113 's was			2
" we are aware of the allegations and are looking into them , " said a federal law enforcement source , who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation			0
" we 'll be looking at anyone acting for or on behalf of @entity3 , from the top down to janitors , " to gather information and determine whether any laws may have been broken , " the source said			2
the alleged 9/11 privacy violations appear to be traceable to a story published the @entity151 , a @entity13 tabloid that publishes a section it calls " gossip gone toxic			0
" the newspaper cited a source who referred to a former police officer who now works as a private investigator			0
the source said the investigator was used by journalists in @entity44 and that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims ' private phone data			0
" until we get some accountability , they 're just going to keep doing it , " said @entity164 , a retired @entity165 of @entity167 deputy chief who lost a son in the attacks			0
" it 's completely unethical , unprofessional and basically criminal			0
rep. @entity176 , @entity177 , told @entity0 that " @entity178 has important oversight responsibilities " in responding to the charges and " getting to the bottom of this evolving scandal			0
" reports were also circulating that actor @entity184 , already in the center of the celebrity hacking scandal in @entity13 , may have a case in the @entity44			0
an @entity33 spokesperson said the agency was " aware of the media reports " that @entity184 was hacked in the @entity44 and that @entity3 had settled several lawsuits with @entity44 businesses , but said there would be no official comment " since these matters are under review			1
" anti-bribery laws @entity3 could face trouble in the @entity44 on another front as well			2
as the parent company of the @entity13 newspapers , @entity3 could be prosecuted for possibly breaking federal anti-bribery laws			1
@entity18 , a 168 - year - old @entity13 newspaper owned by @entity4 , folded in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims , politicians and celebrities			1
police in the @entity13 have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking			1
there also were allegations that reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers			0
potential liability flows from journalists at @entity18 to its parent , @entity21 , and to its parent , @entity3 , which is a publicly held company in the @entity44			2
several @entity44 lawmakers sent letters to attorney general @entity224 asking him to look into concerns that @entity3 violated the @entity226 , known as the @entity226			2
the law , enacted in 1977 , makes it illegal for a @entity44 person or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business			0
in a statement posted on his website , sen. @entity236 , @entity237 , said he wants the @entity238 and the @entity239 to step in : " the limited information already reported in this case raises serious questions about the legality of the conduct of @entity245 and its subsidiaries under the @entity226			0
further investigation may reveal that current reports only scratch the surface of the problem at @entity245			0
accordingly , i am requesting that @entity238 and the @entity239 examine these circumstances and determine whether @entity44 laws have been violated			0

a @entity3 in - store ad company 's practices have led to lawsuits
rivals claimed @entity40 employed unsavory tactics
is @entity40 *isolated* or is it @entity4 's corporate culture ?
@entity3 also faces allegations of phone hacking and possible anti-bribery violations
