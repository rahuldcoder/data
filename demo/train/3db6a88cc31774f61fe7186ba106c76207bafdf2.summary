@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was a red letter day for @entity5 driver @entity4 at @entity0 this week			1
the @entity6 donned @entity8 's famous scarlet uniform as he was chosen to deputize for the injured @entity9 on the final day of in - season testing			1
@entity4 , who drives for the back - of - the - grid @entity12 team , told @entity2 he received a phone call on monday evening asking him to stand in for the @entity15 , who is recuperating from a bruising crash in sunday 's @entity18 @entity17			1
his big chance was widely seen as an audition for a future @entity8 drive -- perhaps as soon as 2016			2
the 24 - year - old did not fluff his lines in wednesday 's session , setting the fastest time and clocking up 89 laps			2
" i was consistent and doing good lap time , " @entity4 said after stepping out the @entity27 racer			2
" i think i showed the team i can work well and i can be quick , but it was a day of testing so it was not the target to compare me with other drivers			2
" it was just the target to improve the car and to help the team , so i think i 've done my job with that and i 'm really happy			0
" it is not the first time that @entity4 , who has been under the wing of the @entity41 since 2010 , has driven in a test for the @entity44 marque			1
but despite a reluctance to talk up his @entity0 outing , the call - up seemed to have extra significance because he was chosen to replace @entity9 , who said after his crash he still wanted to fulfill his testing duties			1
@entity51 , the team 's de facto no. 1 , was also not brought back to @entity1 to help with the crucial final test of the 2014 season			0
" if one day they want me i will be ready , " @entity4 said when asked if he was hopeful his testing performance would lead to promotion to a @entity8 seat			1
" considering that i 'm part of the academy it 's the target one day , so i have to show them			0
" we 'll see because at the moment they have two drivers and they are doing a good job so i do n't think it 's the plan			0
" for the moment i will just focus on what i have do which is with @entity12			0
i think it 's really important to keep going like this			0
" it 's never easy to stay in @entity5 but i hope i show enough to @entity8 that i deserve to stay so they can help me			0
" @entity4 has impressed since making his debut last season with @entity12 , which uses @entity8 engines			1
at the 2014 @entity79 he claimed his first career points -- and the first for the team since it started out as @entity83 in 2010 -- by finishing ninth			0
while @entity4 continues to work towards a future at @entity8 , @entity51 and @entity9 are both out of contract at the end of 2015			1
@entity8 is the only team to boast a lineup of two world champions but the experienced pairing has struggled to deliver results			1
it has been another difficult season for the once - dominant force in @entity5			0
@entity8 president @entity94 went so far as to call it " painful			0
" the @entity8 engine has not matched the might of @entity98 -- which leads both the driver and constructor championships -- and team principal @entity101 resigned three races into the season , triggering structural changes within the organization			2
@entity51 has continued to battle on track , claiming the team 's only podium with third in @entity109 , but there are question marks over @entity9 's performance and motivation since he joined from @entity114			2
the team 's 2007 champion has out - qualified @entity51 twice but has been beaten by the @entity118 double world champion in every grand prix so far			0
if @entity4 represents the future , it is no wonder @entity8 is already looking ahead .			1
