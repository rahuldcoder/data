-- @entity2 house speaker @entity1 reversed her opposition to a vote on offshore drilling on " @entity6 " on monday night , saying she would consider a vote if it were part of a larger energy package			1
@entity2 house speaker @entity1 urges the release of oil from strategic reserves as a way to bring down gas prices			1
@entity1 and fellow @entity15 @entity14 have staunchly opposed @entity17 ' request for a vote on the drilling			1
some @entity17 stayed in chambers after @entity21 adjourned for the session , making speeches on energy policies , in an attempt to get @entity14 to come back for a vote			1
reacting to @entity1 's remarks , @entity15 minority leader @entity27 , @entity28 , said the speaker should call the @entity15 back from its summer recess immediately if she is sincere about a vote on off - shore drilling			1
" our message to speaker @entity1 is very simple : we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now , and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the @entity2 people the relief they expect and deserve , " @entity27 said			1
" if you meant what you said last night , we welcome you and your @entity14 colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on @entity2 energy			2
" on monday night , @entity1 said the vote would need to be part of a larger discussion that would include investing in renewable energy resources and releasing oil from the @entity50			1
those options would help bring both immediate and long - lasting solutions to the energy crisis , she said			2
in her interview with @entity55 , @entity1 talked about what the government and country needs to do to avert the energy crisis and quickly bring down gas prices			1
the following is an edited version of the interview : @entity55 : ok , madam speaker , author of " @entity65 , " why do n't you bring [ @entity21 ] back ? speaker @entity1 : well , it 's interesting to hear @entity70 [ @entity27 ] @entity69 talk about bringing @entity21 back			1
he was n't even in @entity21 this last session when we really had two very important bills on energy -- one to give tax credit for wind , solar and other renewable resources , and another about hybrid cars and the rest			1
so he was n't in to vote when were in session and now he 's saying call it back in			1
and then one of the others said to the president , call @entity21 back in			2
and the president said no. the president said no. but the point is this : the @entity2 people are suffering			0
we have to do what is best for them			0
how do we bring down the prices at the pump ? we have said to the president , the fastest way to do this if in 10 days the price can come down if you will free our oil			1
over 700 million barrels of oil the president is sitting on of the @entity50			1
no. 1 , free our oil			1
no. 2 , they want to drill			0
if they want to drill , we have 68 million acres in the @entity108 that they can drill in that are permitted and all the rest			0
@entity113 , stop the speculation			0
four , renew -- invest in renewable energy resources , which will bring a faster return than drilling offshore , which will take 10 years and produce 2 cents ' reduction in 10 years off the price at the pump			1
and then use natural gas			1
natural gas is so plentiful			1
it 's better for the environment , and it is cheaper			0
so there are things that @entity21 can do , and we have voted on this over and over again			0
but the @entity17 and the president have resisted			0
instead , they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas			2
well , we can do that			0
we can have a vote on that			2
but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them			2
@entity55 : would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling ? @entity1 : i would not			1
it depends how the drilling is put forth			2
but i do n't -- that is not excluded , let me say it that way			0
it depends how that is proposed , if the safeguards are there			0
now , mind you , 68 million acres -- 10 million more acres in @entity157 where they can drill			0
but if there 's -- if we can get some great things , in terms of renewable energy resources : a renewable electricity standard , wind , solar , biofuels and the rest in that context , because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling , you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels , and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment , cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming			1
and the consumer is our first responsibility			0
the @entity2 taxpayer owns this oil offshore , by the way			1
let me make this one final point			0
this oil is owned by the @entity2 taxpayers			2
we give them money to drill there			2
but we get very little in return			0
so i think as we have this debate , which is a very healthy one to have and i welcome it ; we have to review and realign the relationship between our oil , @entity199 's profits and what it means to the consumer and the taxpayer			2
@entity55 : do you expect -- do you suspect the oil companies of having a lot of clout here , influence over the @entity17 ? @entity1 : of course			1
and that 's what we 'll find out			0
@entity55 : they rule ? @entity1 : when we have this vote , when we really define it and where the choice is clear to the @entity2 people -- i mean , do you know what -- @entity223 , their last quarter , their profits were historic			1
last year , they were historic			0
they outdid themselves this year already in this second quarter			0
and they insist that we pay them to drill			0
they need an incentive to drill in order to make over $ 11 billion in one quarter			0
and it just does n't make sense			0
we should be using that money to invest in renewable resources , tax credit for wind and solar , etc. and invest in the technologies that will develop the battery and the rest , instead of giving @entity199 more profits			1
@entity55 : do you expect to get a big enough majority in the @entity246 and @entity15 for the @entity14 to overcome anything and get through your proposals ? @entity1 : well , i hope we can do some of it before we even leave this session			1
i think we can -- hopefully , we can do something before december			0
i will not subscribe to a hoax on the @entity2 people that if you drill offshore , you 're going to bring down the price at the pump			2
even the president says that 's not true			0
ten years , two cents -- we 're saying 10 days , bring down the price , if the president would free our oil from the @entity50 [ @entity50 ] -- from our stockpile -- owned by the taxpayers , purchased by the taxpayers			2
in the next election , i know that we will strengthen our majorities , increase their numbers , and we will have a @entity14 president in the @entity270 , and we will be able to address more fully really what i think is the challenge to our generation -- energy security and global warming .			0
