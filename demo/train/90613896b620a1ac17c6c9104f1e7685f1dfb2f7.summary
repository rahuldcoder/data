@entity0 -- president @entity2 has given a lot of speeches			1
he 's given hundreds since he became president			1
he 's given six in the last two days on his trip to the @entity7			2
but last night 's was the first speech he has given from the @entity9			1
it will not be his last			0
but it was important , and he gave it well			2
it took him five paragraphs to say the serious words we have all known for weeks , but he needed to say : " this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster @entity20 has ever faced			1
" he went on to say what every @entity20 and every victim of this disaster wanted to hear : " we will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes			1
we will make @entity27 pay for the damage their company has caused			1
and we will do whatever 's necessary to help the @entity31 and its people recover from this tragedy			2
" the rest of the speech did n't matter nearly as much			2
there were other things he wanted to say , and some of them were important			2
but the reality is that those 44 words quoted above are action items : we will fight with everything ; we will make @entity27 pay ; and we will help our citizens recover			1
now the president has to make it happen			2
as our nation 's leader , he made commitments and they must be kept			1
we all know the president can give a great speech			1
in fact , he 's president because he first got noticed giving a speech			1
he gave many more inspiring campaign speeches and raised the expectations of millions of @entity20 that things would be different			1
whether they are or not is up to each individual to judge			0
but why there was such a buildup to his giving his first @entity9 speech baffled me			0
the president sits at his own desk in the office he works in every day ; he looks into the camera and reads the teleprompter			0
it 's symbolic , but that 's about it			0
my old boss @entity73 gave most of his big speeches from the @entity9			0
he felt that the office gave gravitas to his words			0
he had a unique ability to look into that camera and make most americans feel he was talking to them -- a very special skill			0
who can forget his speech from the @entity9 on the night of the challenger disaster ? the doubts people have expressed over the last several weeks about @entity2 were : does he get it ? and if he does , is he tough enough to do something about it ? i think he gets it			1
i hope he 's tough enough			2
i think the speech was a good speech			0
it was the public consumption speech			0
it was designed to make us feel better			0
the next speech he gives in the @entity9 is the one that counts			0
it 's a private speech			2
when he meets wednesday with the chairman and chief executive officer of @entity27 , he needs to express the anger and disappointment of the nation and put a fear into this company that will move them to continued action and enough contrition that they wo n't quit until every last legitimate claim is paid			1
that 's what we want to hear ! the president closed his speech asking for prayers			1
" we pray for the people of the @entity7			0
and we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day			0
" i think what the @entity20 public wants is a president who will guide us through this storm			1
if we pray , our prayers are for him and those victims of this disaster			0
the time for speeches is over			0
no more words ; just action ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity136 .			1
