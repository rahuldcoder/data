federal investigators are checking whether 55 colleges and universities illegally handled sexual violence and harassment complaints , the @entity1 @entity0 said thursday			1
such investigations have long been known , but this is the first time that the department has released a list of all probes currently under way			1
the list includes colleges and universities in 27 states and in the @entity16			1
see the full list here " we are making this list available in an effort to bring more transparency to our enforcement work and to foster better public awareness of civil rights , " said @entity18 , the department 's assistant secretary for civil rights			1
" we hope this increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue			1
i also want to make it clear that a college or university 's appearance on this list and being the subject of a @entity38 investigation in no way indicates at this stage that the college or university is violating or has violated the law			1
" five schools promptly responded to @entity47 's request for response			2
the @entity50 , @entity49 said it will cooperate with the investigation and added that its chancellor had sent out a letter to campus saying sexual assault would not be tolerated			2
" much has been done to strengthen the campus ' handling of these issues , but we understand that there is always room for improvement , " the university statement said			2
@entity63 , meanwhile , said it was notified in january 2013 that a federal complaint had been filed and volunteered to work with the @entity0 's @entity65 to improve its policies			1
in february , the university said , federal representatives visited @entity70 and engaged in student focus groups as well as student and employee interviews			2
" there has been no finding of any wrongdoing on the part of @entity63			0
we are still waiting to hear from @entity65 regarding participation in the voluntary resolution process , " a university statement said , adding that there 's no tolerance for sexual harassment , assault or misconduct on its campus			0
the @entity88 said it could not comment on specifics because of the ongoing investigation but said it , too , took sexual violence seriously and provides all victims with resources and assistance			0
the @entity95 said it had " made every effort to comply with the spirit and letter of this inquiry " and is committed to ensuring that its programs and work environment are discrimination free			0
the @entity104 said it was n't surprised by its inclusion as it knew of the probe in july , and it has since hired a law firm to conduct an external review of its policies			0
it also expects to a name a specially designated @entity38 director by the end of the summer			1
see other responses here the investigations center on @entity38 , under which a school must ensure that students are not denied or limited in the ability to participate in or benefit from its educational programs or activities on the basis of sex			1
the list , which reflects open investigations as of thursday , does not disclose any details about the cases , other than when the investigation was opened			1
the list will be updated regularly and available to the public upon request			2
in february , @entity47 profiled student and faculty activists from six schools in a report on how sexual violence complaints to the @entity0 's @entity65 had almost tripled since 2009			1
thursday 's numbers come on the heels of a marked year - to - year increase in complaints the department received , from 17 in 2012 to 30 in 2013			0
five of those six students ' universities were included in thursday 's report : the @entity147 ; @entity148 ; the @entity149 ; @entity150 ; and @entity151			2
in the story , @entity152 , a student at @entity147 who has since graduated , told @entity47 she would not have come forward without the help of a nationwide network that has been a driving force in bringing attention to the way schools handle sexual misconduct reports			0
president @entity160 recently called the nationwide , student - led movement a catalyst for a federal task force to protect college students from sexual violence on campus			0
rape is a longstanding issue on college campuses , but the latest movement , led by student activists , survivors and faculty , recasts sexual violence as a cultural problem on campuses nationwide -- not just a series of isolated incidents			1
students are taking matters into their own hands , filing complaints en masse and speaking out publicly			0
they 've flocked to advocacy groups such as @entity185 and know your ix , which sprang from grassroots activism around university handling -- or mishandling -- of sexual violence			0
@entity192 , a @entity193 attorney and former prosecutor who has worked as a sexual assault policy consultant for @entity150 , @entity196 and other schools , told @entity47 that from one campus to the next , the concerns are mostly the same : lack of clarity , students being mistreated , complex procedures and insufficient training among those leading the processes			0
after she grew displeased with how campus and local authorities handled her case , @entity152 reached out to end rape on @entity211 , and a member of the group helped her file a complaint with the federal @entity65			2
" i 'm not sure i would 've come forward if all these people had n't done it before me , " @entity152 said			0
" i needed the validation			0
i needed someone to confirm , ' you 're right			0
you 're not blowing things out of proportion			0
' ... it was a relief to hear someone tell me , ' you have a case , and they should n't treat you this way			0
' " in thursday 's announcement , the @entity0 said releasing its list " advances a key goal of president @entity160 's @entity231 to protect students from @entity234 to bring more transparency to the federal government 's enforcement activities around this issue			1
" the department also released new guidance this week outlining federally funded schools ' responsibilities to address sexual violence and other forms of discrimination			1
all schools -- from @entity248 to universities -- must comply with @entity38 or risk losing funding and @entity252 action			1
" under federal law , sexual violence refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person 's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent -- including rape , sexual assault , sexual battery , sexual abuse and sexual coercion , " the statement said .			2

list includes colleges and universities from 27 states and @entity16
@entity0 : " we hope this increased transparency will spur community dialogue "
rape is a longstanding issue on campuses , but activists are now casting it as a cultural problem
any federally funded school not complying with @entity38 risks losing funding
