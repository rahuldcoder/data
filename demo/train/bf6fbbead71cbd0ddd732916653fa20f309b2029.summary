-- it 's a warning which will reverberate around the @entity3 paddock with more gusto than the sport 's much derided v6 engine			0
@entity7 , says the sport 's dominant team " definitely has n't peaked yet despite @entity8 having won all four of the season 's opening races			1
" at the beginning of the season we had the car we developed in the winter and now we 're going to keep on pushing , " championship leader @entity7 told @entity0 's @entity13			1
" it has been three weeks since the last race and the development rate is so fast			2
we have 600 people back in the factory working crazy hours to make this car faster in every single race			2
" for example , from the start of the season to the end of the season , you can have a car that is 1.5 seconds quicker by the end just with new parts on the car			0
" it 's a good period for the team at the moment			0
we really have the momentum , a quick car , the best car in @entity3 -- the @entity40			0
" the @entity8 car 's next outing is at sunday 's @entity44 @entity43 , providing @entity7 and teammate @entity45 , who already has three race victories to his name this season , the opportunity to make another giant statement of intent			1
@entity45 and @entity7 have finished first and second respectively in each of the past three races , but the @entity53 is hoping he wo n't have to play second fiddle to the 2008 world champion for a fourth consecutive race			1
" at the moment , it has been all about the battle against my teammate but of course , we 're all conscious that the other teams are flat out pushing trying to close the gap and we need to keep doing a good job to stay ahead , " added @entity7			1
" i 'm just looking forward to the next race and getting the most out of it			0
it 's a tough battle with my teammate at the moment and i need to try and come out on top in @entity71			1
" while @entity8 has enjoyed a stellar start to the 2014 season , there is no sense of complacency , with @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 all striving to produce improved performances in @entity81 to prevent the drivers ' title becoming a two - man race			1
" the first @entity88 round of the year always provides a prime opportunity for teams to arrive with improvements to their cars , " @entity8 executive director @entity85 told the @entity3 website			2
" of course , we are no different to any other team in that respect and our aim must be to increase the advantage we enjoyed at the last race in @entity98			0
" we have seen already that our rivals are relentless in their efforts to close the gap			0
as a team , it is up to us to rise to that challenge -- to take that relentless mentality to an even greater extent than those around us			0
" if we are to build a sustained level of success in this sport , any small advantage must be seen as a platform upon which to build a bigger advantage			0
" we head to @entity71 on good form and in high spirits			2
but , most importantly , we approach the next race weekend as we approached the first -- in the knowledge that there is still a long season ahead and anything can happen			1
