-- @entity1 looks set to slice off a part of @entity4 and keep it for itself			1
with heavily armed @entity9 - speaking troops patrolling the streets , the @entity7 voted thursday to join @entity1 and put its decision to a referendum			2
the all - but - inevitable annexation of @entity14 is moving forward , despite protests , warnings and threats from the @entity18 and its allies			1
we have entered a new @entity21			2
the clash between @entity1 and the forces arrayed in support of @entity4 's independence - minded leaders has crashed the vaunted " reset , " ending hopes that @entity28 and the @entity29 would smooth relations and work hand - in - hand toward common objectives			1
nobody can predict with certainty how this conflict will end			0
but the world can already glean important lessons			0
unfortunately , most of those lessons are cause for deep concern			0
here are five clear messages from the crisis in @entity4			0
nobody 's scared of @entity18 , but @entity18 and @entity47 values hold strong appeal			1
lest we forget , this all started over a move by the now - deposed @entity4 president , @entity52 , who broke his promise to sign a partnership agreement with the @entity55 in favor of closer ties with @entity28			2
ukrainians were enraged , not just because they want more trade with @entity60 but because they have seen what @entity62 standards can bring to a society			0
they were fed up with corruption , authoritarianism and stagnation			0
they wanted their country to be free of @entity28 's interference , and many gave up their lives to fight for an ideal of stronger democratic institutions , rule of law and fair play			0
as strong as the pull of these values is , their principal advocate , the @entity18 , has lost much of its ability to stare down its foes in support of those who want to institute democratic principles in their countries			1
we saw it when president @entity87 declared -- years ago -- that @entity89 dictator @entity88 must step down			0
we saw it when then - secretary of state @entity91 was pelted with tomatoes in @entity93			0
and we saw it in @entity4 , when @entity87 warned @entity95 to respect @entity4 's territorial integrity , only to see the @entity9 capture @entity4 's @entity14			1
its loss of influence means strongmen and dictators have a freer hand			0
5 possible directions in @entity4 2			0
you do n't mess with @entity95 without paying a price			1
even if @entity28 were to relinquish all control of @entity4 territory today , @entity95 has already achieved a main goal			2
he has sent a clear message to countries that were once part of the @entity112 -- and perhaps to the @entity112 's former @entity47 satellites -- that they can not defy his wishes without paying a painful price			0
in that sense , @entity95 has won			2
a top @entity95 aide warned last summer that @entity4 was risking " suicide " if it dared to defy @entity28			2
now we know this was no bluff			0
@entity95 is serious about protecting @entity28 's sphere of influence			1
it 's not clear how closely he wants to control what are supposed to be independent countries			0
opinion : did you expect @entity1 to ignore @entity4 chaos ? 3			2
if you are a vulnerable state , you may regret surrendering nuclear weapons			1
this may be the most dangerous of all the lessons from this crisis			2
@entity4 had a sizable nuclear arsenal at the end of the @entity21 , but it agreed to give it up in exchange for security guarantees			1
in the @entity138 , @entity4 committed itself to dismantling the world 's third - largest nuclear arsenal			2
@entity1 , in exchange , vowed to respect @entity4 's borders and its independence			1
now , @entity1 has clearly violated those commitments			2
if @entity4 still had its atomic weapons , @entity28 would have thought twice before seizing parts of @entity4			0
do n't expect support from all international peace activists ( unless the @entity18 invades )			2
to liberal activists in @entity4 and @entity1 , the reaction from international peace movement must be a hard pill to swallow			2
parts of @entity4 have been captured at the point of a gun by a regime that actively suppresses dissent			0
when liberal @entity9 protested , police arrested hundreds of anti-war demonstrators			0
while @entity1 's invasion of @entity4 territory and its harsh crackdown on local protests have been criticized by some human rights activists , the reaction among some prominent " peace " activists has been astonishing			1
several have mimicked @entity95 's line , blaming the @entity18 for the crisis			1
instead of taking a clear stance in support of a country with invading military forces on its soil , some so - called anti-war groups have taken the opportunity to dust off their anti-american vitriol			0
a favorite line of discussion is whether @entity180 has any right to criticize @entity1 's invasion of @entity4 territory after the @entity18 invaded @entity183 , a country that was ruled by one of the world 's most brutal , genocidal dictators			1
however misguided @entity18 's @entity183 invasion , even drawing the comparison is an insult to @entity4			1
opinion : @entity95 's @entity4 endgame 5			1
the use of brute force to resolve conflicts is not a thing of the past			1
one day , if history moves in the direction we all wish , countries will solve their disputes through diplomacy and negotiation			0
sadly , that day has not arrived			0
@entity205 has expressed dismay at @entity95 's " 19th - century " behavior , but power politics , forcible border expansion and brazen aggression have not been relegated to the history books ; witness events in places like @entity89 , the @entity214 and now in @entity4			1
those are the first five lessons			0
but allow me to offer a bonus , a work in progress that could join as no. 6 : when the stakes grow high enough , the @entity18 and @entity60 may rise to the challenge			1
western nations seemed caught off - guard by @entity95 's " incredible act of aggression , " as @entity205 termed it			1
some of @entity95 's gains ( see no. 2 ) may be irreversible			2
but the @entity18 and @entity60 have been shaken up by events , and they may yet send a message of their own , helping @entity231 's government succeed and prosper as it sets out to chart a future of its own and limiting @entity95 's ability to replicate his acts of intimidation			1
@entity205 's visit to @entity231 was a powerful moment			0
his unvarnished message to @entity95 , if backed by action , was a respectable start			0
the @entity18 would prefer to see this crisis resolved through negotiations , he declared , but if @entity1 chooses not to do so , @entity180 's and its partners " will isolate @entity1 politically , diplomatically and economically			1
" already the @entity55 is offering @entity4 an aid package comparable to the one @entity95 used to lure it away			1
secretary of defense @entity246 is boosting ties with @entity249 and the @entity250 , and economic sanctions are under discussion			0
if @entity95 wants another @entity21 , he has one			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			0

@entity257 says @entity1 looks ready to claim @entity14 ; it 's a new @entity21
crisis shows that @entity18 , @entity55 are not *feared* , but their values first prompted protests
other lessons ? mess with @entity95 at your peril ; giving up nuclear weapons leaves you vulnerable
@entity257 : @entity95 shows brute force still works , but @entity18 , @entity55 may still rise to challenge
