-- @entity1 has a maiden @entity3 title in his sights to banish memories of an agonizing end to his 2010 campaign			1
the @entity8 led the crivers ' championship for @entity11 for most of the season only to be pipped at the post by team - mate @entity14 , who secured the title in the final race at @entity16			1
@entity1 's year was dominated by controversy , as he accused his team of treating him as a " number two driver " and had a high - profile collision with @entity14 in the @entity21 which cost them both the chance of victory			1
but despite missing out on the @entity3 crown , the 34 - year - old says he has moved on from the disappointment of his near miss. " i 'm completely over it , " he told the official @entity3 website			1
" life goes on and i do n't feel any regret			0
it was quite a season			2
it was an incredible year			0
" i lost the championship in the last race and over the whole season no one had a one - race lead over the other guys fighting for the title			1
i still think i had the opportunity to be the champion , but i did n't do it because i did n't get the job done on the track			0
" every race was alive			0
even if we 'd had one more race after @entity16 four guys could have still won the championship			1
he ( @entity14 ) did a great job and deserved the championship			1
" there been a lot of great moments for me , but of course i did n't get the jackpot			0
but i am still very proud of what happened			0
i am definitely looking to improve this year			0
" away from the track , the relationship between @entity1 and @entity14 was a running theme throughout the season as the pressure of the title race set in			1
but @entity1 says it is important for @entity11 that he and @entity14 enjoy a harmonious start to the season			1
he said : " i would say our relationship is pretty good at the moment			1
we had some contact over the winter -- not a huge amount , but enough i would say to have a good start into the season			2
" i am not stupid and know that harmony in the team is important and the drivers play a key role in this			2
what is important is that we do n't destabilize the team			0
" @entity11 were propelled into the limelight as their drivers finished first and second in the title race , while the team romped away with the constructors ' championship			1
and @entity1 says @entity11 will come back stronger in 2011 as a result of the pressure they experienced during a record breaking season			1
" of course you always learn from such a situation			0
probably everybody does -- not only the drivers			2
it was a new situation for us -- suddenly being the pacemaker on the grid			0
" in the end it was a very , very successful season for the team so i would say we managed all the hiccups perfectly			2
you need to be flexible and adjust to what might happen			0
" that 's what we 've learnt as a team			2
it was a new situation for everybody in the team , from the drivers to the management to everybody on the floor			0
