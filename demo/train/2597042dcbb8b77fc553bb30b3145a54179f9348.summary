-- it reads like something out of a @entity4 monster movie : enormous angry hornets invade cities , dive - bomb unsuspecting civilians , and inflict horrifically painful and in some cases fatal stings			1
but it 's not science fiction , it 's real			0
every year around this time , the @entity15 giant hornets move into cities in @entity17 , @entity4 , @entity18 , the @entity19 and other areas in @entity15 to forage for food for their young , and that 's where the trouble starts			1
more than 40 people have died so far this season from the powerful stings and scores have been hospitalized			0
emergency response teams are on the hunt for the nests to destroy them before the insects do more damage , and authorities have set up medical units to treat the injured			1
so what do the hornets have against city dwellers ? nothing , really			1
the hornets just happen to be in an unusually desperate situationn -- largely due to humans			1
the revulsion and panic that people feel when they read about these incidents or see pictures on tv and on the @entity50 should be about something more than fear			0
it should provide a moment to consider the impact of humans on their environment -- one that can end up biting them back			1
@entity15 giant hornets do n't eat much solid food as adults ; instead , they forage for food for their young , often stealing the larvae of honeybees or other insects , but sometimes they forage for scraps of fish in city garbage cans			1
then they fly incredible distances to deliver the food , arriving exhausted and starving			1
they get their only nutrition from their children			0
that 's right : the babies feed the parents			0
these grub - like hornet larvae enjoy the meal their parents have brought them , then the parents tap on their heads , which prompts the larvae to offer up a few drops of clear liquid			0
the amino acids and other nutrients in this liquid fuels the adult hornets , and they fly off in search of more food			1
sounds aggravating , does n't it ? i 'd be angry , too , if i had to go to that much effort to feed my young			0
at one time , the hornets could forage through forests and fields to find a meal for the kids			1
but now , as those wild areas are paved over , the hornets find themselves on our turf			2
their search for food is as desperate and fast - paced as it ever was , only now they must contend with parking lots and apartment buildings where they once only had to battle other insect foes			2
this is not the first time that we humans have moved into wild areas and found ourselves doing battle with wild creatures as a result			2
one example : in the 19th century , great swaths of @entity127 wilderness were hacked down to make room for plantations			2
once people started living in areas that had been wild , they found themselves exposed to new diseases that had never before posed much of a threat to humans			2
the assassin bug , a bloodsucking insect native to the region , helps transmit a disease called @entity141 disease			0
it had never before been widespread among humans ; its reach was primarily confined to other jungle - dwelling animals			2
but once people moved into the insect 's habitat , the disease began to spread among us and continues to do so			0
the deaths inflicted by the asian giant hornet threat are indeed tragic			0
but they also serve as a reminder that nature is fierce and powerful			2
the hornets are not invasive ; in this case , it is the humans who are invasive			1
there can be consequences to moving in on another creature 's territory			0
the asian giant hornet is feeling the pressure that species all over the world are experiencing			0
the only difference is that the hornet has found a way to push back			0
can you blame it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			1

@entity173 : @entity15 hornets have killed , injured many in @entity15 cities
she says they *'re* *venturing* great distances for food as their habitats are vanishing
human *intrusions* have long touched off battles in nature , @entity185 says
@entity185 : the hornets are not invasive ; in this case , it is the humans who are
