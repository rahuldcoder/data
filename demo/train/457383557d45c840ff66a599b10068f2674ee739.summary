@entity0 -- i had just pulled up in front of my hotel in @entity0 when i heard @entity5 had died at the @entity6 , just a few blocks from where i was staying			1
i sat motionless in the car for a brief moment , not in shock , but temporarily paralyzed by a profound sense of sadness			0
later that night , a large crowd of people hovered outside the site of her passing , some holding lit candles , others holding one another			0
it may be weeks before we officially know what happened			2
the autopsy is complete , but the toxicology report is still pending			1
but many of us have already drawn our own conclusions based upon @entity5 's well - documented -- and sometimes mocked -- struggle with drug addiction			1
i hope she can at last have the peace that seemed to avoid her over the last 15 years of her life : the marriage to @entity34 , the reality show , the erratic interviews and appearances , and the heartbreaking live performances that served only to remind us that her voice , @entity42 , was gone , and @entity5 was lost			1
we all could see she needed help -- but only she could seek it			0
that 's why if you did n't get goosebumps during @entity49 's @entity48 tribute on sunday , you may not be fully human			1
@entity50 sang " @entity55 , " in a lower key than @entity5 's signature version , but with a delivery that served a much higher purpose			1
we need to say our goodbyes and @entity50 's performance was part of this process			2
buying @entity5 's music is another , as evidenced by the presence of all of her classic singles currently occupying the @entity65 chart			1
my favorite ? " @entity67 , " mostly for the line , " learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all			0
" so prophetic , so empowering			0
i ca n't help but think if she had lived by those words she might never have lost her magnificent voice			1
she might still be with us today			0
all weekend long , we 've seen clips of her @entity77 interview from 2002 , in which she talked about her struggles			2
many of us were not very kind afterward , joking about her " crack is wack " line , and wondered how someone so beautiful and talented , rich and famous , could struggle			0
from the outside looking in , it looked as if she had it all			0
if there 's ever been an example of money not buying happiness , the @entity5 tragedy would be it			1
there was a moment when no other singer on the planet possessed her range , power and vocal clarity			0
true , she did n't always record the most groundbreaking material			2
in fact , an argument can be made that the arrangement of some of her most successful singles epitomized the radio - friendly manufacturing that choked a lot of creativity out of late ' 80s music			2
and certainly the rise of grunge and hip - hop in the ' 90s served as a rebellion against the numbing sound of that predictability			0
but there was always room for @entity5 because her voice made room			1
two of her biggest hits -- " @entity67 " and " @entity55 " -- were originally recorded by @entity126 and @entity127 , two very successful artists			0
but once @entity5 got hold of those songs they became hers			2
so , with all due respect to @entity133 and @entity50 and all the other powerhouse vocalists today , it 's doubtful anyone can take a @entity5 song and make us forget it is a @entity5 song			1
in fact , the kiss of death for any contestant competing on " @entity142 " or any of its copycats is to try to sing @entity5			1
i do n't know why they even try			0
the competition is tough enough without the added , self - imposed pressure of trying to reach a bar so high that many use the word " angelic " to describe it			0
if i remember correctly , there was a time in which the angels themselves would gather round to hear @entity5 sing			1
join the conversation on @entity159			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			2

we do n't know why @entity5 died ; toxicology report due in a few weeks
@entity162 : her struggles with addiction over the past years were well - known
but nobody matched her voice , he writes , and nobody can sing a @entity5 song
@entity177 says @entity5 's tragedy is a prime example of money not buying happiness
