-- despite the obvious claims of younger rivals @entity3 and @entity4 , few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted @entity6 as the 2007 @entity7			1
@entity9 genius @entity6 fully deserves winning the 2007 @entity7 award			2
the prestigious @entity12 award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and @entity6 's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25 - year - old @entity9 's current standing in world football			1
when @entity21 defeated @entity22 in the @entity24 final in @entity25 , avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in @entity28 two years previously , it enabled @entity6 to fulfill his dream of holding aloft @entity31 's premier trophy -- a winner 's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90 - minute performance			1
@entity6 's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the @entity39 from @entity40 for a fee of just $ 8.5 million in the summer of 2003			0
unlike many a @entity9 sporting genius , @entity6 did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town			2
he was born into a comfortable middle class @entity48 family , where football was not the only hope of a bright future			0
however , it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by @entity40 , after his family had moved there , at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18 - year - old			1
@entity6 's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and @entity63 named the graceful midfielder in his 23 - man squad for the 2002 @entity67 finals , earning him a winners ' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against @entity72			2
a year later , and @entity6 was on his way to @entity21			1
within a month he had made the starting line - up and his 10 goals helped the @entity21 lift the @entity76 and the @entity77			0
throughout his career , @entity6 has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games			1
yet to describe @entity6 merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice			0
tall , elegant and blessed with astonishing skill , @entity21 and @entity88 utilize @entity6 's ability superbly			1
@entity21 coach @entity91 soon recognized @entity6 's genius , changing his team 's system to a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 , playing the @entity9 behind a main target man			1
with @entity96 and @entity97 holding the central midfield area , @entity6 has a license to roam in behind the lone striker , be it @entity101 , @entity3 or @entity102			2
and @entity6 does this with devastating effect , running at the opposition with pace and power , finding defense - splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead - ball situation or open play			0
the fly in the ointment for @entity21 comes in the shape of their poor form this season			0
although they have already reached the last 16 of the @entity24 , the club are floundering in @entity121 and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season 's competition unless they win the trophy			0
@entity127 have coveted @entity6 for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if @entity21 do n't secure a place among @entity31 's elite			0

@entity6 deservedly named @entity134 for the first time in his career
the @entity9 beats @entity3 and @entity4 in the journalists ' vote
the 25 - year - old averages one goal in three games for both @entity21 and @entity88
