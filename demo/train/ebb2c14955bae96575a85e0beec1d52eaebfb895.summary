-- a new battle has erupted on the global stage over the future of free speech			1
its epicenter moved to the @entity7 , where world leaders expounded on the great issues of the day			1
the annual @entity7 gathering came just days after a chain reaction of ferocious protests in @entity14 countries against a video on @entity16 insulting @entity17			1
reaction to the video led to the deaths , at last count , of more than 50 people , including the @entity24 ambassador to @entity25 , @entity26			1
so , the hateful video and the mass violence became an inescapable topic at the @entity30			1
and yet there was intense disagreement about what exactly was troubling about the events of the last few weeks and what action they demand			0
in the view of some @entity40 and @entity14 leaders , the time has come to draft new international rules limiting free expression for the sake of preventing insults to religions			1
the head of the @entity49 , @entity48 , called for " criminaliz ( ing ) acts that insult or cause offense to religions			2
" this move to impose anti-blasphemy laws should come as a call to action for democracy advocates everywhere : freedom of speech , a most fundamental of human rights , a cornerstone of democracy , has come under international attack			1
certainly , non-muslims living in some of those countries have had nightmarish experiences with them as the bans are used to target minorities and government critics			0
among political leaders , however , the idea appears popular			2
the anti-islam video itself has apparently caused more anguish than the ensuing killings			2
or at least it has seemed politically expedient to create that impression			0
@entity77 president @entity76 , for example , declared , " the world is shaken by the depravity of fanatics who have committed acts of insult against the faith of over 1.5 billion @entity14			2
we strongly condemn these offensive acts , whether it involves the production of a film , the publication of cartoons , or indeed any other acts of insult and provocation			0
such acts can never be justified as freedom of speech or expression			2
" the emir of @entity98 , @entity99 , noted he " firmly " believes in free expression , explaining , " freedom should not cross reasonable limits and become a tool to hurt and insult the dignity of others and of religions and faiths and sacred beliefs as we have seen lately , which regrettably led to the killing of innocent people who have not committed any crime			1
" he thus blamed the film , rather than those who committed the killings			0
during a time such as this -- when new democracies are taking shape in the @entity119 , and people everywhere are giving serious thought to what kind of system , what kind of laws and what kind of societies they want to live in -- the debate could hardly matter more			2
that 's why it was heartening to hear president @entity131 mount a spirited defense of free expression			1
@entity131 staked out a position that is generally accepted in @entity136 democracies , and enshrined in the @entity137			1
" i accept that people are going to call me awful things every day , " he said , " and i will always defend their right to do so			2
" he added , " @entity24 have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views -- even views that we profoundly disagree with			1
" and he made the fundamental argument that " the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression , it is more speech			2
" the @entity24 president 's professorial defense of the admittedly complex case for allowing people to say offensive things came as a refreshing change from @entity24 's international campaign of contrition for the offending video , which seems less than consistent with its belief in free speech			1
it is appropriate for @entity24 leaders to explain they found the @entity169 film reprehensible			1
but additional steps , including the spending of $ 70,000 in @entity24 taxpayers ' money for an ad campaign in @entity175 rejecting the video , is a step too far , especially considering that the riots that followed were to a large degree a result of political manipulation			1
@entity183 's campaign blurred the basic point and confused @entity24 's position			1
more than anyone , that hurts the efforts of the brave advocates for human rights in @entity40 and @entity14 countries , who have been badly outnumbered and outmaneuvered in the aftermath of the @entity40 uprisings			2
@entity131 's @entity7 speech should mark the start of a push for more , not less free speech throughout the world			1
and every effort to limit it under the guise of defending the feelings of followers of any religion must be met with the strongest possible resistance			0
it is not coincidental that many of the same countries where large demonstrations erupted in recent weeks are places where religious freedoms do not exist , where @entity212 have come under attack and @entity214 are insulted and threatened routinely and without consequence			0
muslim states have tried before to push a " @entity218 " resolution at the @entity30 , just as religious and political leaders , seeking to bolster their popularity , issued fatwas calling for the religiously sanctioned assassination of artists whose work they deemed offensive			1
just as the fury over the anti-islam film raged , the bounty for killing @entity226 , the @entity228 - born @entity227 writer , was boosted to more than $ 3 million			0
@entity226 was sentenced to death by @entity233 's @entity232 in 1989 because the imam deemed one of @entity226 's novels , which surely the ayatollah never read , offensive enough to merit death to the writer			0
blasphemy laws exist in a number of countries			0
one can argue it 's their right to enact the laws they see fit -- even though they violate international agreements			0
but they most decidedly should not be allowed to alter international agreements establishing the right of free expression for all human beings			0
if @entity14 are offended by distorted perceptions of their religion , by all means they should fight back			0
they should launch a campaign to educate the world about @entity17			0
i believe their campaign would prove greatly successful			0
the right response to stupidity , prejudice and hatred is shining a light on the truth			0
that has a way of highlighting the stupidity of the bigots			0
it may not end all dumb and offensive films , but it will ensure that the people who espouse offensive ideas remain a despised , marginalized and powerless minority			0
in this new battle on the global stage over the future of free expression , the bigots will only lose if free speech wins			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity285 .			0

@entity287 : a recent @entity169 video became an inescapable topic at the @entity30
@entity291 : some leaders say we should limit free speech to prevent insults to religions
she says calls for anti-blasphemy laws should alarm democracy advocates
@entity291 : president @entity131 is right to defend free speech and @entity24 should push for it
