-- @entity2 president @entity1 has won praise for his government 's effort to bring about a cease - fire between @entity7 and @entity8 , a delicate balancing act for the country 's nation 's first freely elected leader			1
@entity2 has been the go - between in many previous @entity7 - @entity14 disputes			1
but while longtime @entity2 strongman @entity15 was hostile to @entity8 , the @entity14 @entity16 movement that rules @entity17 , @entity1 's @entity18 is the group 's political cousin			1
and although @entity1 leads a population with deep historical sympathy for the @entity14 , he has pledged to maintain @entity2 's peace treaty with @entity7			1
" he has clearly recognized @entity2 's national interest here , and hopefully this can succeed and take hold , " said @entity24 , the former @entity25 majority leader and @entity29 administration @entity27 envoy			1
the truce was announced wednesday evening in @entity35 after eight days of fighting , and it appeared to be holding in its early hours			0
under @entity15 , the country 's security forces had suppressed its own islamists in the @entity18 , even jailing @entity1 at one point			1
after eight days of violence and 150 deaths , a cease - fire that has given @entity1 and his government influence with @entity8 that @entity15 , a product of @entity2 's military establishment , never had , said @entity48 , a professor of international relations and @entity27 analyst at the @entity51			1
" @entity8 listens to @entity1 , " @entity48 told @entity0 as the talks were still going on			1
" @entity8 looks up to @entity2 now , at this particular stage , and that is why @entity2 has emerged as the most important state vis - a - vis @entity8 and @entity17			1
" @entity2 's role in the talks was " pivotal , " he said			1
@entity1 has used his intelligence chief , @entity59 , to spearhead separate talks between @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity59 played a major role in the release of @entity63 , the @entity7 soldier held captive by @entity8 for more than five years , and has good contacts with @entity7 intelligence officials			2
opinion : real peace coming from this cease - fire ? @entity7 government spokesman @entity69 told @entity0 that the deal announced wednesday " offers a future where we can have peace and quiet in the south			1
that 's good for @entity7 ; it 's also good for @entity77			0
" and the exiled political leader of @entity8 , @entity79 , told reporters after the agreement that @entity2 " behaved responsibly			1
" " @entity2 did not sell out the resistance , " @entity79 said			2
@entity1 took office at the end of june , nearly a year and a half after the revolt that toppled @entity15			2
the @entity88 - educated engineer quickly rattled @entity90 nerves by announcing he would work to free @entity91 , now serving a life sentence in the @entity88 in a conspiracy case related to the 1993 @entity95 bombing ; and by attending the august summit of the @entity97 , held in @entity98 , the first visit by an @entity2 leader since the @entity102 revolution in 1979			1
but he also took a swing at @entity98 's ally @entity105 during that conference , calling the embattled government of president @entity108 " an oppressive regime that has lost its legitimacy " and calling for support for opposition groups trying to overthrow him			0
opinion : how this could be the last @entity17 war when sniping across the border separating @entity17 from @entity7 erupted into open warfare last week , @entity1 put the blame squarely on @entity7			2
@entity2 recalled its ambassador to @entity7			0
@entity1 also called the @entity7 bombardment of the territory " a blatant aggression against humanity " and dispatched his prime minister , @entity124 , to @entity17 for talks with @entity14 officials , a step @entity15 would have been unlikely to take			2
that put @entity2 at odds with the @entity88 , which contributes about $ 1.3 billion in military and economic aid to @entity35 every year			0
@entity88 and several @entity133 leaders have put most of the blame for the current crisis on @entity8 , saying @entity7 has a right to protect itself from rockets fired by @entity14 militants			0
@entity2 needs @entity90 support to help revive its economy , which went into a tailspin when the uprising against @entity15 broke out in january 2011			0
and its 1979 @entity144 accords with @entity7 remain the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the turbulent region			0
@entity29 's telephone diplomacy @entity1 faces pressure from the @entity2 public to take a tougher line against @entity7			1
an april 2011 poll by the @entity154 found that 54 % of @entity2 want to abandon the @entity2 - @entity7 peace treaty , while 36 % want to keep it in place			2
when the latest fighting erupted between @entity8 and @entity7 , @entity2 @entity159 chief @entity158 said @entity2 would continue to observe that pact			1
but he added , " respecting a peace treaty does not mean to stay idle or indifferent to what is going on along our borders			0
" the @entity2 government this week allowed some victims of the fighting in @entity17 to enter through the @entity170 crossing into @entity2 , as well as the elderly and children			0
though the @entity170 crossing still has restricted access , a policy continued from @entity15 's rule , that access has been tightened or loosened since @entity1 took office , depending on the local security conditions			2
this week , the @entity2 government allowed more than 500 @entity2 to cross into @entity17 in a show of solidarity with the @entity14 , waving @entity14 flags and chanting , " @entity7 is the enemy			0
" @entity183 , who helped organize the effort , told @entity0 , " we just broke the siege			0
" violence flares in @entity35 but that border is also a sign of a deteriorating security situation within @entity2 , where much of @entity15 's feared apparatus has been dismantled since his ouster			2
more than 500 top officers of @entity15 's @entity193 have retired or been sacked , and militant groups have found space in places such as the sparsely populated @entity197 , where they have received shipments of weapons from @entity201 and elsewhere			0
in one attack on a military outpost in @entity197 in july , militant islamists killed 16 @entity2 soldiers			0
@entity1 's government responded with a campaign aimed at driving them out of the region , accompanied by the firing of the region 's governor , military police chief and intelligence director			2
always an undergoverned area with scant respect for the state , @entity197 is dominated by @entity219 tribes who are also accomplished smugglers			0
nevertheless , @entity24 said @entity1 's government " has invested a lot of effort and in a sense prestige in this			1
so i think they will be trying very hard to make certain this that this cease - fire does hold , at least for a sufficient period of time so that the parties can discuss the broader issues			1
" " i think it will only redound to his benefit , both domestically and around the world , " @entity24 added			0
" but in the end , his success or failure will rest upon how well the people of @entity2 feel their interests have been met in terms of the need for jobs , for education -- the same things that people want everywhere in the world			0
" @entity0 's @entity247 and @entity248 in @entity249 and journalist @entity250 in @entity35 contributed to this report .			0
