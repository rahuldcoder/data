-- @entity1 has just entered the streaming music business with the launch of @entity4 , a music player that lets anyone upload their music to @entity1 's servers and play them via the web or @entity11			0
the new cloud player service adds a new " save to @entity19 " button for saving @entity14 to the cloud , as well as an option to upload music from a hard drive to a user 's @entity19			1
users are given 5 gb of free storage , but can get 20 gb if they purchase an album through @entity1			1
it 's $ 1 per @entity25 after that			0
@entity4 comes in two flavors , an app for the web and an @entity11 app counterpart			0
both players allow users to upload their music , create playlists and organize their music			0
and because it 's a cloud - based platform , users can access their music and settings from any compatible computer or @entity11 device			1
the most comparable service to @entity19 is probably @entity41 , which also lets you upload your music , though @entity1 has several major advantages in its mp3 store , its longstanding payment system and its stronger brand recognition			2
@entity47 and @entity48 have been rumored to be hard at work on their own cloud - based players , but it looks like @entity1 beat them to the punch			1
@entity1 's @entity54 will certainly face a stiff challenge when they launch their own streaming music services , especially given @entity47 's control over @entity11 and @entity48 's control over @entity59 and @entity60			2
