-- when the @entity1 announced it would no longer deliver mail on saturdays , those of us with e-mail anxiety had a moment of jealousy			1
what would it be like to have two whole days when the @entity10 just did n't deliver to anyone 's inbox ? it would be pretty great			1
unfortunately , e-mail is only becoming more of a round - the - clock presence , but a novel new e-mail tool could make it more manageable			1
meet the @entity19 app mailbox is a much hyped new app for the @entity22 that chips away at overflowing inboxes with simple gesture controls and a brilliant snooze feature			1
as of thursday , it is finally available in the @entity27 after half a year of sneak peeks and raves from beta testers			0
i 've been using it for my personal e-mail and have become hooked			1
developed by @entity34 , the 2 - year - old @entity35 , @entity36 , startup behind the orchestra to - do app , @entity19 takes the familiar mobile mail app look and adds simple swipe controls for categorizing and prioritizing messages			1
" we started this company on this belief that people use e-mail like a terrible to - do list , " said @entity43 , founder and ceo of @entity34			2
the app 's solution is to quickly get things out of your inbox that are n't urgent so you can better focus on the tasks that are important right now			1
it does this with four main gestures			2
swipe partially to the right on a message to archive it , all the way to the right to delete it			2
a long drag all the way to the left can add an e-mail to a list , and a short drag brings up the app 's very best feature : snooze			1
open up your e-mail and look at what 's lingering in your inbox			1
how many are urgent tasks , and how many fall into the gray area of pending , semi-urgent , or indefinitely postponable ? instead of leaving them in your inbox where they add to the noise , @entity19 lets you breezily put them off with one gratifying tap			1
the snooze feature lets you postpone a message for any length of time			1
choose later today , this evening , tomorrow , this weekend , next week , in a month , someday ( set for three months by default ) or a specific date from the grid of icons			0
you wo n't need to see or think about those messages again until reminded at the chosen date and time			0
though cleared from the inbox , nothing is really gone			2
all snoozed messages are organized in the later tab and archived messages are under the archive tab			0
reaching for @entity100 there are big issues with the state of modern e-mail			2
mostly , there 's just too much of it			2
there are personal messages , work conversations and never - ending group threads on important business decisions -- or where to go for lunch			2
the majority are e-mails generated by machines such as mailing lists , travel confirmations , store offers , bank statements and bill reminders			2
the inbox is filling too many roles at once , as a catch - all receptacle , to - do list and filing system			2
mailbox is based on one of the more popular methods for dealing with the deluge , @entity100			2
it 's a system for clearing out clutter and handling e-mails requiring action championed by @entity136 , founder of the @entity136 blog			1
" there are a lot of things hanging around there that just ca n't be dealt with until some other time and yet they stare back at you and nag , " said @entity43			0
moving those nagging e-mails out of the way is a great goal , but many people find constantly fighting the flood in traditional e-mail clients to be more of a time suck than a time saver			1
@entity19 's gestures turn the process into an easy and , oddly , fun activity			1
once you master the swiping gestures , the clearing process is fast and simple and requires minimal amounts of thought			2
you do n't have to agonize over what folder that e-mail from your boss belongs in , just put it off until tomorrow morning			2
" a third of our beta testers get to @entity100 once a week , " said @entity43			0
" when you do get to zero it does n't mean you have nothing left to do , it means you have nothing left to do right now			0
" designed for satisfaction the app was partially inspired by @entity173 , a stunning to - do app that came out a year ago and wowed app designers with its fresh take on the smartphone user interface			0
it was all swipes and bold colors and gestures , a few new rules you had to remember but that soon made complete sense			0
" many people have heralded @entity173 as being one of the big moments in mobile user interface development , " said @entity43			0
" no buttons , just gestures			0
man does it feel good to check something off in @entity173			0
" mailbox has adapted some of those satisfying features and combined them with a traditional inbox design			1
like @entity173 , it takes a bit of practice for the gestures to become second nature , but when they do you 'll execute them without hesitation			0
after tablets went mainstream , many people caught themselves mindlessly trying to tap or swipe non-touchscreen desktop monitors			0
people had picked up a new way of interfacing with a device that seemed more natural than a mouse and tiny pointer icon			0
the same thing happens after you use @entity19 for a while			0
i became more impatient with sorting through mail in my regular app , occasionally swiping to snooze a message in the default by mistake			1
big dreams for future versions the first version mailbox app is promising , but it 's still in its infancy and is far from being the savior of e-mail			1
part of that is by design			0
@entity19 's developers are only focusing on mobile for now			0
the first version of the app only works on iphones and can only be used with @entity236 accounts			0
the demands for a mobile e-mail application are less complicated than a desktop client			0
on a computer , people want things like calendar and contact integration , and have complicated folder , tag and color systems			0
being mobile works in @entity19 's favor			0
it 's a great excuse to create a stripped down e-mail client and start from scratch , focusing only on the basics			1
" the primary use on mobile is triage , " said @entity43			0
orchestra does plan on expanding the app over time , depending on how it 's received			1
the company 's goal is to always offer a free version of the app , but also roll out a more advanced paid version , like @entity263 and @entity264 have done			1
there has already been so much demand that the company is taking precautions and rolling it out slowly with a wait list			0
when you download the app , you can reserve a spot on the list and the app will show you how many people are ahead of you			0
once it 's in wider use , @entity19 will likely add more features , support additional e-mail clients and develop an app for @entity282 devices			1
@entity43 imagines an app that manages not just e-mail accounts , but the inbox for any service with internal messages , such as @entity288 and @entity289			1
a future mailbox could even automatically chip in with the sorting , making sense of the automated e-mails like mailings and boarding passes , and even adapt based on your habits over time			1
and eventually , @entity34 may create a desktop version of the @entity19 app. but for now the company is practicing what it preaches and focusing on the most important task on its to do list : create a great , simple mobile e-mail app.			1

mailbox is a *highly* anticipated @entity22 app for better organizing your e-mail
it uses swipe gestures to help quickly clear your inbox and focus on important tasks
the app 's *killer* feature is a snooze button , letting you ignore e-mails until later
