-- actress @entity1 says she feels passionate about @entity2 , whose " extraordinary " people are inspiring her with their resilience after the devastating earthquake one month ago			1
during a visit to @entity2 this week , she said that despite the terrible tragedy , @entity2 are dignified and calm			1
@entity1 , a good will ambassador for the @entity8 high commissioner for refugees , said of the @entity2 , " they 're very inventive people , they 're very strong people , and they 're finding ways to help themselves			1
" " i think we have a moral duty to do what we can for any country that 's suffering , " she told @entity0 's @entity11 in an exclusive interview from @entity13			1
" i think we have a very big obligation to the place			0
... i 'll continue to come back and i 'll continue to express what i am learning			0
" @entity1 expressed particular concern about the fate of @entity2 's children -- the amputees , the homeless and the orphans -- and worried about the risk of child trafficking			1
@entity2 earthquake : numbers tell the story " trafficking has been a huge problem for a very long time ... so i think everybody that means well needs to really take that very seriously , and not get frustrated , but really work with the country , " she said			1
" and for myself , as somebody who is an adoptive parent , i understand the urge to assist in that way , but now is not the time			2
an emergency is not the time for new adoptions anyway			2
" pressed on whether she might consider adopting a @entity2 child , @entity1 told @entity11 , " i 'm always open to children around the world			1
we 're that kind of family			0
@entity50 [ @entity50 ] and i talk about that			0
" but that 's not what we 're focusing on at this time , by any means			1
we 're not here for that			0
we 're here to see how we can help protect the children in the country and scale up the needs here			1
" @entity1 said it is vital to reunite families that have been torn apart by the disaster and set up a system to register survivors			2
" we do n't know who is an orphan			0
i 've met [ @entity2 ] women in the @entity69 in hospitals who were saying they have n't spoken to their children , " she said			1
" they have no cell phones , they have no way to tell their children they 're alive			2
they ca n't find them yet			0
" she also was worried about children who lost limbs in the earthquake			2
" you see little kids that have lost their legs and you ask them if they are all right and they say they 're ok , and somehow they are able to smile			0
... i think [ that ] says a lot about them			0
" @entity1 said it 's vital for the world to provide sufficient housing for survivors -- housing that is strong enough to stand up to hurricanes			1
" we saw a large amount of tents , new tents , but that 's not necessarily going to be the answer because they 've got this much bigger problem in how to find proper shelter to survive hurricanes , " she said			2
last fall , hundreds of people died in flooding and landslides as two large hurricanes and a tropical storm hit the nation			0
@entity1 said the scale of the disaster is nothing like she 's seen before			1
" the complexity of this before and now , and the history of this country , is something that i am still trying to wrap my head around			0
and it 's going to be a very , very difficult road			0
