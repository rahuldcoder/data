-- two men claiming to be @entity3 - area gang members have posted a video showing them firing rifles in @entity7 's civil war , apparently fighting on behalf of president @entity9 's regime			1
in the profanity - laced video , the two men fire rifles from behind a cinder - block wall at " enemigos " -- enemies -- though the camera never shows an enemy in the distance			1
the two men often refer to " gang - banging " and their " homies , " and one of them displays gang hand gestures and tattoos			1
the video was publicized this week by the @entity24 , a @entity25 - based organization that studies and translates news accounts and social - media postings			1
" this is very unique because these guys are over there , and they are with the pro-syria forces and pro-hezbollah forces , " said @entity28 , executive director of the institute			1
" we have been monitoring foreign fighters over the years , and there has been a handful of @entity39 going to fight , but they have been going to fight against @entity9			0
" the @entity41 's @entity40 is investigating the video			1
" the jttf is aware of the video and is investigating to determine any potential threat to @entity39 or to @entity39 interests , " @entity41 spokeswoman @entity43 said in a statement			1
" we are not in a position to provide further comment at this time			0
" the ties to the @entity9 regime apparently stem from how one of the two gang members identifies himself as " @entity55 " from the @entity57 gang			1
some @entity58 side with @entity9 because he has protected the minority group in @entity7			0
@entity55 uploaded the video and photographs to his @entity63 page , where he is identified as " @entity66 " and by his real name , @entity65 , according to @entity24			1
the video was also posted to @entity68			2
although media accounts and @entity24 explained that @entity72 's facebook page contained several photos and comments earlier this week , his page was taken down as of wednesday			0
@entity24 's website , however , has reposted @entity72 's photographs showing him wearing @entity78 garb and standing by a purported @entity78 operative , @entity24 said			0
the @entity81 militant group @entity78 has fought on the regime 's side of @entity7 's three - year civil war			2
@entity78 is deemed a terrorist group by the @entity39 government			0
@entity72 is also photographed standing beside the man who also appears in the @entity7 video , @entity24 said			2
that man in the video calls himself " creeper " and says he 's a member of the @entity92 - 13 gang			1
in the slang of a @entity96 gang - banger , @entity93 often sprinkles his fluent @entity97 with @entity99 words			1
" judging by the photos , @entity55 seems to have been fighting in @entity7 since december 2012			2
comments by @entity55 's @entity63 friends suggest that the two were deported from the @entity39 due to their involvement in criminal activity , " @entity24 's website says			2
in the two videos , the two men appear to be addressing gang members back in the @entity3 area while they fire their rifles			2
creeper : " we 're in @entity7 still gang - banging			1
" later he adds : " tell the homies : in the ... @entity113 , still gang - banging			1
" @entity55 : " we 're in @entity7 , homie			2
we 're in @entity7 , homie			0
... we 're on the ... front line			0
" in the video , @entity93 cites rappers mr. @entity117 , mr. @entity120 , but those rappers distanced themselves from the video			0
" i 've spoken to both @entity125 and @entity120 , and none of us have any associations whatsoever with the two men in the video , " the rapper mr. @entity117 said in a statement			0
" i 've been very blessed to have the most amazing fans from all walks of life and with all kinds of political views			0
i personally do not condone any type of violence or any type of action that leads to criminality			0
" i 'm by no means a political person and will not be speaking on the subject of @entity7 , on which i 'm wholly uninformed , " the rapper said			0
@entity7 submits revised plan for removing chemicals @entity0 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
