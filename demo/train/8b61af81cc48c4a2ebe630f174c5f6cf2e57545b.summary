@entity0 -- the @entity2 gave an @entity4 death row prisoner another chance wednesday to appeal his conviction after a mailroom mistake and other circumstances initially left him unable to pursue further claims in court			1
at issue was whether a missed deadline to file a key appeal provided justification to grant @entity17 a second chance , when the error was not the inmate 's fault and the result would mean a punishment as serious as lethal injection			1
the justices ' 7 - 2 ruling was a setback for the state , and the inmate 's case now goes back to lower courts			2
" the uncommon combination of mishaps in @entity17 ' case , we hold , provide just cause to excuse the procedural lapse in state court , " justice @entity32 wrote for the majority			1
the compounding series of errors and negligence involved both state officials and the private attorneys once representing him			2
the prisoner 's new legal team , supported by some civil rights groups , argued the criminal justice system was being turned on its head by potentially allowing prisoners to suffer the consequences of their lawyers ' mistakes or incompetence			1
but state attorneys countered that long - established rules on filing often complex paperwork must be strictly enforced to ensure that all parties -- including the courts -- get a proper chance to hear the claims in an orderly fashion			0
and the state says that in this case , @entity17 ' initial appellate attorneys were from a blue - chip law firm in @entity68			1
@entity17 was convicted in the 1995 murder of two companions , @entity71 and @entity72 , with whom he had been drinking heavily			1
court records showed that @entity17 took a .22 - caliber rifle in his @entity76 , @entity4 , home and shot both men twice in the head , execution - style			1
he later confessed to police but offered no explanation for the crimes			0
he was convicted , and the jury recommended the death sentence by a vote of 10 - 2			0
after the conviction , two attorneys from the law firm @entity87 , working on behalf of @entity17 for free , filed a motion in an @entity4 court claiming ineffective assistance by the trial defense			1
the chain of errors may have begun when the appellate lawyers did not list the name of their firm in the papers filed in @entity4			0
when that court later sent two copies of its ruling denying the motion to the @entity68 - based attorneys , the mailroom inexplicably sent them back unopened			2
the envelopes were labeled " @entity106 -- left firm " and " @entity106 -- attempted not known			0
" both lawyers had , in fact , left the firm , but no notice of new legal representation at the same firm was given to either the court or to @entity17 himself			1
a local lawyer in @entity4 not heavily involved in the appeals also received the initial ruling , but he , too , did not follow up to ensure that the @entity68 lawyers continued the necessary filings			2
by the time the mix - up was discovered , apparently thanks to inquiries by the inmate 's mother , @entity17 ' window for appeals had run out			1
the local judge was not sympathetic , saying the county clerk was not required to follow up or investigate why the key documents were sent back without acknowledgment			0
" how can a circuit court clerk in @entity132 , @entity4 , know what is going on in a law firm in @entity68 , @entity135 ? " @entity137 circuit judge @entity136 asked in his ruling			2
subsequent state and federal courts also refused to grant @entity17 another chance to file his appeals , saying the 42 - day deadline was standard and non-negotiable			1
but the high court 's majority spread the blame on both the state and , especially , @entity17 ' attorneys			1
@entity32 noted attorney " negligence " alone rarely gives inmates a second chance in court to contest their convictions			0
but the court majority said this case presented an " extraordinary " set of facts , including that @entity17 was " abandoned " by his lawyers			1
" they did not inform @entity161 or the @entity4 court of that reality , " @entity32 wrote			0
" through no fault of his own , @entity17 , an inmate on death row , was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state habeas petition			2
moreover , he lacked any clue that he had better fend for himself			0
" the majority was also tough on the state 's refusal to give @entity17 a break in light of these circumstances			2
" if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing @entity161 ' procedural default here , it does so whenever a defendant 's procedural default is caused by his attorney , " not the state , he said			0
" that is simply not the law -- and can not be , if the states are to have an orderly system of criminal litigation conducted by counsel			1
" justice @entity192 joined in the dissent			0
this high court victory for @entity17 does not mean he will eventually receive the new trial he is seeking			1
because so much of the facts and testimony of the various parties remains in question -- particularly the actions of the county clerk and the in - state attorney for @entity17 -- lower state and federal courts could be wrestling with this case for years			2
@entity87 employs about 800 lawyers , charges premium client rates , and does significant pro bono work on behalf of a variety of indigent prisoners			0
the firm is more than 130 years old			0
among the 34 states with the death penalty , @entity4 alone does not automatically give all its 200 or so current capital inmates taxpayer - funded legal assistance to file papers challenging their convictions , sentences and lethal punishment			0
big out - of - state firms like @entity221 and @entity222 often step in and tackle the usually long and expensive appeals process			0
lawyers for @entity161 say that missed deadlines , whatever the reasons , have occurred before and that some flexibility should be built into the system , especially when it involves crucial issues like habeas corpus and the death penalty			0
" it 's really an almost unthinkable situation , and anyone , even the most ardent supporters of capital punishment , ought to be concerned about the result in this case and should not want a decision allowing a man to be executed in these circumstances , because that can only erode public confidence in the system of capital punishment , " attorney @entity232 , who is now working on the case , told @entity1 in a recent interview			2
@entity232 is from the @entity250 law firm , hired to represent @entity17 before the @entity2 in the new round of appeals			1
the case is @entity254 ( 10 - 63 ) .			0

an " uncommon combination of mishaps " justifies allowing an appeal , the court says
@entity17 was unable to pursue appeals after a series of mistakes
@entity175 , in dissent , says the ruling *imperils* the " orderly system of criminal litigation "
