-- when @entity2 invoked his religious faith during his public apology on friday , he readily acknowledged that a lot of people would be surprised			1
" people probably do n't realize it , " he said , " but i was raised a @entity9 , and i actively practiced my faith from childhood until i drifted away from it in recent years			1
" but @entity2 said his @entity9 faith would be a key part of his quest to put his life back together after revelations of his marital infidelity , which he admitted for the first time			1
@entity9 experts said @entity2 ' summation of the tradition 's beliefs was accurate -- and that his remarks likely will bring more attention to the faith in a week when its highest profile leader , the @entity27 , is visiting the @entity28			1
" i have a lot of work to do , and i intend to dedicate myself to doing it , " @entity2 said , reading a statement from @entity30 , @entity31			0
" part of following this path for me is @entity37 , which my mother taught me at a young age			0
" " @entity37 teaches that a craving of things outside ourselves causes an unhappy and pointless search for security , " he continued			0
" it teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint			0
obviously , i lost track of what i was taught			0
" a handful of @entity9 scholars said @entity2 ' description of @entity9 teaching was spot on			1
" @entity2 was quite accurate , " said @entity55 , a professor of @entity9 studies at @entity57			1
that 's a fundamental @entity9 idea			2

@entity77 ' mother , @entity76 , is a @entity72 - born @entity9			2
" i like @entity37 because it 's a whole way of being and living , " @entity2 told @entity62			1

" he 's said to be a @entity9 -- i do n't think that faith offers the kind of forgiveness and redemption that is offered by the @entity94 faith , " @entity87 said			1
" so my message to @entity2 would be : @entity2 , turn to the @entity94 faith and you can make a total recovery and be a great example to the world			1
" but @entity9 scholars say that forgiveness and redemption are core components of the faith			2
" you 're always beginning again in the @entity9 tradition , " said @entity109 , a prominent @entity9 teacher based in @entity110			0
" you see that you 're causing harm , you repent and ask forgiveness in some formal or informal way , and you start again			0
" some @entity37 experts said that 's what @entity2 appeared to be trying to do today			1
many @entity37 applauded @entity2 ' statement			2
