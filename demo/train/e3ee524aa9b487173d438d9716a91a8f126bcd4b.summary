-- what if , instead of picking up a smartphone or touching a mouse , you could just say , " remind me to buy shampoo , " " play some bluegrass music , " or " how many moons does @entity8 have ? " in the middle of your living room ? last week , @entity13 unveiled an unusual product , @entity15			1
it 's a $ 199 stand - alone smart speaker with a splash of @entity18 and no screen			1
it has a far - field microphone that can hear a voice clearly from across a room			2
utter the keyword " @entity25 , " and the speaker 's virtual assistant springs to life , ready to answer questions , provide news updates and set personal reminders			1
it takes the intelligence and voice - recognition of @entity18 and puts it someplace unexpected , inside a smart home device			1
even when it 's alseep , @entity15 is still listening for the trigger phrase that will turn it on and start streaming your voice to the cloud			1
if a music speaker can listen and reply to your voice , why not a connected thermostat like @entity45 ? in a few years , we will fill our homes with " smart " clocks , refrigerators , tvs and security systems			2
together , they 'll help voice assistants break out of single devices to be available anywhere in your house , car or workplace			0
the biggest tech companies are betting that these voice - activated interfaces will be the next major way we interact with our computers			0
@entity13 's @entity25 joins @entity64 's @entity18 , @entity66 's @entity65 and @entity67 's , well , @entity67 in a race to be the dominant speech assistant			1
@entity64 's @entity18 has an optional always - listening mode called " @entity18 " but it only works when the device is plugged in			1
the @entity72 and @entity73 also offer perpetual listening for their voice controls			0
" over the past decades , there has been a series of ' battles ' to gain market share at the point where users interface with computers , " said @entity77 , the co-founder of @entity18			2
it started with operating systems , then search engines and most recently app stores			0
now those same companies , and some new players like @entity13 , are looking ahead to voice interfaces that can communicate in natural sounding language			2
" i think the major companies have to get into this game or risk not having direct interaction with a user , " said @entity77			0
@entity13 's attempt at building a phone failed , but the company is determined to be an entry point for the @entity101			1
the @entity15 is n't available yet , but @entity77 thinks the company has the resources and experience to create a solid voice - activated assistant			1
it has also been quietly buying relevant companies like @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
" building a high - quality voice assistant with broad capabilities is not trivial and typically requires the expertise and resources of big companies like @entity64 , @entity67 , @entity66 , with many @entity114 and machines and technologies , " said @entity77			0
most small smart - device manufacturers would n't be able to make their own interface , but down the line they might be able to license existing assistants			0
@entity77 's new company , @entity121 , is working on an intelligent assistant that will be open to third - party developers			2
computers that understand regular spoken language and can follow instructions , even chat back , are big in science fiction , most famously @entity129 's " @entity128 , " @entity130 and the recent film " her			0
" the computers of the future are n't just highly intelligent , they all seem to have fantastic , ubiquitous , invisible microphones			0
we are still a long way from artificially intelligent assistants			0
but as voice - activated interfaces show up in more products like @entity15 , every corner of every room has the potential to be quietly listening for our next command .			1

@entity13 's new speaker @entity15 has a @entity18 - like smart assistant that is always listening
more smart devices like thermostats and speakers are connecting to the internet
in the future you could walk into a room and give commands without touching anything
