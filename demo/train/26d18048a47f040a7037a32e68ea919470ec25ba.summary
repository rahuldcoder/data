@entity0 -- between 20 and 25 employees of @entity4 's " @entity3 " have been laid off and host @entity5 has taken a substantial pay cut , a source with direct knowledge of the situation told @entity1 on saturday			1
the employees were let go friday , with @entity5 's salary reduction intended to prevent even more staff reductions , the source said			1
the actions were taken as @entity4 seeks to move the show to a cost structure typical of late - night programming , as opposed to prime - time shows , according to the source			1
@entity5 replaced the legendary @entity19 as host of " @entity3 " in 1992 , a job he held for 17 years when he left in 2009 to helm " the @entity23 " with a 10 p.m. start time			1
but a few months later , in january 2010 , @entity4 announced the comedian would once again move to his old 11:35 p.m. time slot			0
the @entity28 - raised comic 's venture into prime time three years ago was pitched as an attempt by the network to parlay his proven popularity into a commercially successful show			2
but lagging ratings prompted @entity4 executives to change course within a few months			0
that move ultimately led to fellow talk show host @entity39 's departure from the network			2
@entity39 now hosts a show , " @entity44 , " on @entity42 that , like @entity1 , is a division of @entity43			0
