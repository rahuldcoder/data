@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 sheriff @entity3 calls himself " @entity6 's toughest sheriff			1
" he is famous for creating a tent city jail in the @entity1 desert ; for providing pink underwear for inmates ; for bragging that he spends more to feed his dog than a prisoner in his jail			2
this year he has made national headlines for his tough enforcement of @entity1 's anti-illegal immigration laws and for his vocal support for a controversial new immigration law that takes effect at the end of july			1
but the 77 - year - old lawman is himself the subject of serious allegations of abuse of power			1
@entity3 's critics say he has a long history of launching bogus criminal investigations against political opponents and anyone else who gets in his way			1
this year a federal grand jury started looking into the allegations			1
former @entity34 superintendent @entity33 says what happened to her is a case in point			0
@entity33 says was locked in a political battle with some members of the @entity4 board of supervisors over school district funds when the sheriff 's swat team came in the dead of night to search her home			1
@entity33 was charged with stealing money from a school for homeless students			0
there were 25 felony counts in all			0
" never could i have imagined what a nightmare was waiting ahead , " @entity33 said			0
@entity3 promised to uncover massive public corruption -- " we are looking into all avenues of this investigation , " he said -- and to win a speedy conviction			1
from the start @entity33 maintained her innocence : " i kept saying i did n't do anything			0
i did n't do anything			0
" it took three years , but finally a judge threw out all the felony counts against @entity33			0
she entered a guilty plea to a single misdemeanor charge			0
but she said her reputation had been shattered , her career destroyed , and she owed more than $ 100,000 in legal fees			0
" i still do n't think that everybody knows i was innocent , " she said			0
@entity3 has launched -- either on his own or in conjunction with the county attorney -- high - profile criminal investigations against a who 's who of @entity4 politicians and officials			1
the list includes the mayor of @entity0 , a former police chief , two members of the board of supervisors , @entity83 judges , and even a former state attorney general			1
the charges have included public corruption , misuse of taxpayers ' dollars , bribery , rape and even child molestation			0
what all these investigations hold in common is that they were launched with great public fanfare , but rarely resulted in convictions			1
among the investigations recounted in this report , the only conviction has been on the misdemeanor charge against @entity33			2
@entity0 mayor @entity102 calls the sheriff 's long list of investigations a " reign of terror			1
" @entity102 came under @entity3 's scrutiny , he says , after speaking out against the sheriff 's neighborhood sweeps to round up illegal immigrants			1
the mayor says he received a torrent of records requests from sheriff 's investigators , and he was later told that he was under investigation on possible child molestation charges			2
@entity102 says the sheriff " bragged that he was watching my office from his office with a telescope			2
" the sheriff 's department confirmed that @entity102 was investigated on child molestation accusations			2
in the end charges were never filed			0
" he is a coward , " said former @entity124 , @entity1 , police chief @entity125			2
in 2004 @entity125 challenged @entity3 's bid for a fourth term in the sheriff 's office			1
that was when the local news reported that @entity3 was investigating his rival on charges of rape			1
it was a claim made by @entity137 's foster mother			0
she claimed the rape occurred 30 years earlier , when @entity125 was only 15 years old			0
@entity125 says he was the victim , not the foster mother			0
once again charges were never filed			0
but @entity125 noted the sheriff alerted the media to the details of the sordid accusation			2
" they put out a media campaign against me , " he said			0
" that i was the subject of a criminal probe			2
" it sounds familiar to @entity152 @entity151			0
" they indicted me on 118 counts			0
" he said , " none of which i 'm guilty of			0
" those 118 counts of public corruption against @entity151 made big headlines before they were thrown out of court by a judge			0
@entity3 has refilled many of those charges and @entity151 is still fighting to clear his name			1
@entity3 turned down @entity2 requests for an interview , citing the federal grand jury investigation and a series of threatened lawsuits from these and other cases			1
however , one of @entity3 's long - time assistants was eager to defend his boss			1
deputy chief @entity174 says that in each and every case , the sheriff 's investigations were fully justified			1
" was there probable cause ? there was a ton of probable cause , " he said			0
in the rape investigation of the sheriff 's political rival , @entity125 , for example , @entity174 says it was a case the sheriff had to investigate			1
" we did n't make up the mother 's testimony , " he said			0
" it came in here like a bombshell			0
" @entity174 says it was just coincidence that the sheriff benefited when the story was leaked to the press			2
@entity199 is another @entity3 ally			1
he is the former @entity4 attorney who participated in a number of @entity3 's high - profile cases			1
he is currently running for the @entity1 attorney general 's office			0
he , too , defends @entity3 's investigations , saying , " the reality is these were legitimate cases that needed to be brought			1
" " it was n't just brought up out of thin air , there was evidence to back up those cases , " he said			0
the sheriff 's critics , he said , are " being portrayed as martyrs and i feel that 's absolutely inaccurate			1
" @entity199 paints a picture of @entity4 as a pit of corruption that includes the judicial system , which he blames for his lack of convictions			1
" we had to go into courts where the judges were collaborating with the targets of the investigations , " he said			2
" they were working together to thwart investigations ( and ) prosecutions			2
" the @entity230 takes a different view			0
its ethics committee is currently considering a case against @entity199 for his role in @entity3 's investigations of public officials , the association said			1
@entity174 says it is up to the public to untangle the web of political intrigue surrounding @entity0 and its environs			2
" the electorate is going to have to say we do n't want to do this anymore , and we will vote one or more people out , " he said			0
" right now the sheriff 's polls indicate that the public still supports him rather overwhelmingly			2
" whether the grand jury investigation or the threatened lawsuits bring change remains to be seen			1
@entity253 , a newspaper editor who was once arrested after criticizing @entity3 , says the end is not yet in sight : " if you are a critic of the sheriff , or if you represent an opportunity for publicity , you become a target for this man			1
