-- there are , of course , those massive stone statues of ancient legend lining its coast			2
then there 's the epic isolation -- more than 2,000 miles from the nearest population centers ( @entity11 , @entity12 ) , it 's one of the most remote inhabited places on the planet			1
but those are n't the only reasons to rank @entity17 ( " @entity17 " to locals ) high on your list of exotic travel wishes			2
polynesian in culture , @entity11 in nationality , this volcanic archipelago in the southeastern @entity23 remains a vibrant center of unique @entity29 culture and otherworldly scenery			2
what 's more , it 's not hard to get to , with @entity11 's @entity33 making the five - hour flight from @entity35 to @entity17 several times a week			1
measuring 15 by eight miles , it 's easy to cover all of @entity17 in a single , unforgettable stay			1
here are five reasons to start planning now			2
@entity39 numbering almost a thousand , the moai ( monolithic human statues carved from a single piece of stone ) are scattered all over the island			1
they 're the principal reason people come to @entity17 and truly make any trip a once - in - a - lifetime experience			2
carved in the image of the island 's @entity17 ancestors , the statues date to the twelfth century and measure up to a staggering 32 feet ( 10 meters ) in height			1
excavated in the 1970s , they stand in long lines			0
some are solitary and all face inland			0
like caricatures , they 're fat , thin , big , small , tattooed -- you name it , the @entity17 carved them as an expression of an intricate culture that also included petroglyphs , tattooing and ancient @entity68 's only written language			1
@entity69 one of many @entity17 mysteries is how this remote piece of land came to be inhabited			1
most historians agree that @entity29 seafarers arrived around 400 ad , but no one knows for sure -- some have posited an extraterrestrial connection			0
what is known is that it was n't until 1722 , when a @entity81 expedition arrived , that the @entity17 had any contact with outsiders			0
at the time , the moai were still standing @entity85 the local population numbered around 20,000			1
today , the islanders number 5,000 in total			0
that 's just four times the number of moai and less than the island 's horse population			1
but the island 's one - of - a - kind culture is kept alive with activities and festivals that highlight ancient arts such as spear throwing , tobogganing , dancing and body painting			1
the island 's top celebration is the @entity69 ( february 1 through 15 , 2013 ) , which revolves around a series of competitions based on ancient sports			1
the highlight is the @entity107 , in which male islanders ( wearing only small loin cloths ) toboggan down the @entity112 volcano on banana tree trunks			1
it 's a bumpy , crazy ride			1
the last competitor remaining atop his log is declared the winner			0
there are also dance competitions , carnival - style parades , food exhibitions and the crowning of the @entity69 queen			1
volcanoes @entity17 is primarily made up of three extinct volcanoes : @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
the youngest of the three , @entity126 forms the vast part of the island			1
its slopes served as the @entity133 quarry , providing the volcanic tuff from which the moai were carved			1
today , 400 eerie , petrified heads poke out of @entity126 's grassy hillside , looking as though they were captured and frozen while trying to climb out of the mountainside			2
@entity127 makes up the island 's east " wing " and @entity128 forms the south			1
@entity128 has a huge , impressive crater			0
it sits astride the ceremonial village of @entity145 , which has breathtaking 360 - degree views of the island and @entity23			2
food @entity17 is n't a gourmet destination -- years of deforestation have led to a scarcity of local resources			0
but being surrounded by ocean means that seafood is n't just a staple , it 's outstanding			1
fresh beans and yams tend to round out most plates			0
in @entity163 , the @entity162 's @entity161 restaurant might be the best place to eat on the island			1
it serves a delicious seared tuna and other local specialties according to the availability of ingredients			0
it also has sweeping ocean views			0
the resort also includes a bistro that serves pasta and cocktails			0
in @entity181 village , @entity179 o @entity177 has excellent empanadas for those seeking simple , local food at reasonable prices			0
( note : local restaurants are n't ' budget ' cheap -- for example , you can expect to pay more than us $ 20 for a dish of spaghetti at many places )			0
eco-lodges a highlight for many visitors is a stay in one of the @entity17 's eco-lodges			1
on the southeast side of the island , @entity199 is made entirely of local wood and gets high ratings for privacy			2
opened in 2007 , the lodge says it was the first in @entity207 to receive @entity209 ( @entity209 ) certification from the @entity210			0
the lodge has 30 bedrooms and undisturbed views over fields , red coral trees and the @entity23			0
situated on a chunk of craggy coastline , @entity216 has 79 bedrooms and is within easy walking distance of the main village of @entity181			0
it 's built in true eco-style , with adobe buildings topped with grass roofs			2
inside , cypress tree trunks form pillars and en suite bedrooms have handmade clay baths			0
it 's like staying in a very luxurious cave			2
