-- his long hair has been shaved off , he has to wear a @entity4 's uniform and is given orders like a soldier , but @entity7 is not in the military -- he has in fact refused to join the @entity10			1
he may have refused to join then , but he 's still forced to look like a soldier in prison			0
the 19 - year - old has been in prison for 20 days			2
he 's a " refuser " -- the name given to conscientious objectors who refuse to join the @entity18 military on political and ethical grounds			1
we drove from @entity21 to @entity22 , near @entity23 , at 6 a.m. -- @entity7 was due to be released for the weekend and we were meeting his parents at the gates as they were expecting his release anytime between 8 and 9:30 a.m. as we wait , i witness an impatient mother anxious to see her son , pacing			1
he is her " baby , " the youngest of three boys			0
but this mother has found herself at the heart of a divide in @entity18 thinking , a society sometimes split between patriotic , isolationist thought and inclusion			1
@entity38 has two other sons serving in the military , one of whom is in @entity43 in @entity44			2
the boys in the military did n't want to appear on camera or talk to us			2
when i ask @entity38 about her feelings about the differences amid her family , she shrugs and says simply , as only a mother can : " they 're all my boys			0
" his father @entity55 at first seems uncomfortable with not only our presence , but his son 's choices			0
but that all slipped away pretty fast when they saw @entity7			1
the teenager is questioned before release , and finally emerges at 10:30 a.m. the father hugs him and cheers			0
they are " happy to see his smile " says @entity7 's mother and " relieved " says his father			1
but he 's only out for the weekend and must return -- it 's only then he 'll be told how long he 's back in for -- possibly another 20 days			0
this process can go on for months			0
first stop for the teenager -- a plate of hummus -- and then time , to sit down with me to discuss his carefully considered political and ethical views			1
i learn that the family lives in a " @entity79 " or @entity81 commune in the north of @entity18 and @entity7 's views were formed at an early age in a joint @entity86 - @entity18 ( or @entity81 ) school			1
" i understood that @entity86 can be my friends , @entity86 are not at all my enemies , they are my neighbors			0
" why not join the army for the sake of military service , i ask him			2
" if i would n't be a fighter and i 'd just sit in an office , someone else would fight , someone else will kill people , someone else will occupy and also i would occupy -- i will support a system that occupies			0
" but does @entity7 really think being a refuser can change anything ? he is after all in a minority			1
" i know my step wo n't stop the occupation but what i hope to do is that people will see i refuse and will think twice before they join the army ; if they 're now in the army they 'll think twice before they 're pushing the button and killing people in @entity44 , " he explains			0
at this point i ask him about his brother , who is in the @entity10 and has been serving in @entity44			0
" there is debate ... but there is still brotherhood , " he replies			2
@entity7 's mother has accepted her sons ' choices			1
she hopes her sons in the military can be at peace with their actions but respects their choice to do their duty			1
and @entity7 's decision , she says , did n't come as a surprise , she has watched him develop his political thought			1
she says the family has learned from it			0
" we need these people , as a mother of course i ask why my son , but we need these voices to be heard			0
we should n't be afraid			0
nothing will happen to @entity18 if 400 people say we 're not going to @entity44			1
" in fact she likes the idea of citizens challenging politicians			0
she tells me she does n't want prime minister @entity144 to feel too comfortable sitting in his seat of power while this conflict continues			0
in an interesting take @entity7 tells me , even as an @entity18 citizen , he too feels " occupied , " a concept i had n't considered			1
" the basic freedom that people do n't get in @entity44 , also in @entity152 , also here in @entity18 , is because of the occupation			1
because of the occupation , i live in a military society , in a violent society , a chauvinistic society			2
" the @entity10 would n't tell @entity0 how many teenagers are enlisted into military service every year for , they say , security reasons			2
neither would they share the number of refusers			2
@entity7 's parents , @entity38 and @entity55 , both served in the military			1
while they 're proud to have children making independent decisions , there is a mixture of confusion and concern amid their openness			0
his father , who at first i thought was against his son 's decision , is not so much opposed to it , as concerned			2
he is not sure @entity7 understands the complex situation , which he says he hates			1
neither side is right or entirely to blame , he explains : " @entity180 is wrong and @entity18 is no angel			1
" he however , sees a combined military and political solution to the situation			1
but he wants to be able to debate with his son who has ended the discussion and made up his mind			2
@entity7 's mother has accepted his path but is concerned his decision may have repercussions			1
are you scared of the backlash ? i ask @entity7			1
" i get messages in my @entity195 and email -- that people want to kill me , i 'm a traitor ... but i 'm fine , i 'm not scared			0
" @entity7 is clear , he does n't support @entity180 -- he does n't believe they 're helping the @entity200 cause at all			1
they are also not helping their own people			0
but neither does he support @entity18 's response to @entity180 's rockets			1
but what would he say to people who say he 's not being patriotic or respectful of his country ? he is forceful			2
confident and without thinking twice responds			0
" i do n't want to respect my country , i do n't want to be patriotic , i want to respect people , not countries			2
" military service is compulsory by law in @entity18			1
men must serve three years ; women must serve two			2
everywhere we go in @entity18 we see teenagers in military fatigues carrying their guns , a badge of honor , a reminder this country considers itself under threat and has the right to self defense			1
to stand out from such a strong national narrative is n't easy			0
but @entity7 is clear , he 's no hero , it 's not about courage or even about him			1
" this is also one of the problems that people look at me that i 'm brave , [ but ] i do n't want them to look at me that i 'm brave , i want them to look at the occupation			0
the @entity18 military points out that not all are conscientious objectors like @entity7			1
but some @entity18 teenagers do say no. @entity7 is not alone , he is one of 130 young @entity18 who wrote to @entity144 -- not only refusing to serve but criticizing @entity18 politics , policy and accusing the state of war crimes -- an allegation the state rejects			1
later in the evening , on his first of just two days out , he takes time to meet his friends ... and other refusers who have held a party for him			0
the group call themselves the " @entity250 against the @entity251 " and operate through word of mouth and @entity195			0
they are @entity18 boys and girls who feel their voice too should be heard			1
they posted their letter on @entity195 and invite people to sign it			0
i meet several of them that evening who signed the letter to the pm			2
these are incredibly politicized young people who want to break free from the national narrative -- articulate teenage activists			2
@entity266 , who is 16 and still at school , says : " i do n't agree with what the army does			0
i think it 's immoral and it 's only hurting us and the @entity200			0
" @entity273 is an 18 - year - old social volunteer for @entity274			0
" i think the army plays a big role in getting our society militarized and getting our society very much concentrated around violence and repression and it is not something i want to take part in			0
@entity284 , aged 19 , says : " as a citizen ... i live because of the suffering of @entity200 and because of that i chose to be against the occupation			2
" though not huge in number , their opinions and actions are adding to the debate inside @entity18 - a discourse these young @entity18 hope will lead to a more open society			1
yet the operations and conflict continue			0
