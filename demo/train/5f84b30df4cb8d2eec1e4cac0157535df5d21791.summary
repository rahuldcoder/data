editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- in the year 2050 , if @entity20 is right , nanoscopic robots will be zooming throughout our capillaries , transforming us into nonbiological humans			1
we will be able to absorb and retain the entirety of the universe 's knowledge , eat as much as we want without gaining weight , shape - shift into just about any physical form imaginable , live free from disease and die at the time of our choosing			0
all of this will be thrust on us by something that @entity20 calls the @entity34 , a theorized point in time in the not - so - distant future when machines become vastly superior to humans in every way , aka the emergence of true artificial intelligence			1
computers will be able to improve their own source codes and hardware in ways we puny humans could never conceive			2
this will result in a paradigm shift that sees mankind coalescing with its own creations : man and machine , merging into one			1
these grand - scale premonitions are largely based on @entity20 's law of accelerating returns , which states that the development of technology has been increasing exponentially since the beginning of time			1
that concept is n't really compelling to the masses until one focuses on the " knee " of this exponential curve -- the point where the perpetual doubling of technological growth skyrockets and negates the linear models of progress that people like economists have relied on for so long			2
@entity20 says we 're just about to start rounding this bend and that the rate of progress will be so great it will " appear to rupture the fabric of human history			1
" in other words , we will trump nature and take control of our own evolution			0
@entity20 's magnum opus , " @entity83 : when @entity88 , " outlines the implications of this transition in a way that is simultaneously believable , terrifying , meticulous and mind - bendingly absurd			1
it was published in 2005			0
that may seem like only a short time ago , but an incoming technological explosion of nuclear proportions is n't so far - fetched when you consider everything that 's changed just between then and now			0
@entity95 , iphones , the comment on the @entity99 wall as the new pickup line ? the devices and programs we were using four years ago already seem outdated			0
" @entity107 , " a documentary about @entity20 by filmmaker @entity109 that was released digitally last week , offers a revealing glimpse inside @entity20 's mind and elaborates on some of the ideas found in " @entity83			1
" see the rest of " @entity34 of @entity20 " at @entity111 people like to tag @entity20 as the " rightful heir to @entity114 , " and that 's not a stretch considering he 's responsible for some of the most useful inventions of the past century			1
an optical - character - recognition machine for the blind that 's capable of reading most types of printed text aloud , the ccd flatbed scanner , speech - recognition software , the first synthesizer that created sounds virtually indistinguishable from those produced by their acoustic counterparts , and a whole bunch of other nifty things we can barely comprehend came from @entity20 's brain			1
when i met @entity20 at his office in @entity136 , he was dressed in a slightly crumpled navy suit jacket and slacks			1
as he emerged from the columns of books surrounding his desk , he seemed almost meek and startled even though he had postponed our interview by over half an hour			0
but after speaking with him for two minutes i would n't have been surprised if he told me that he had already received artificial neural enhancements and other biological upgrades			0
his intelligence operates on a higher plane , but his true gift is the ability to distill his complex theories into easily digestible terms			0
regardless if you agree with @entity20 's ideas , he certainly knows more than a few things that the majority of us do n't			2
we 'd be really foolish not to listen as closely as possible .			0

@entity20 is an inventor , *entrepreneur* , author and futurist
he predicts future in which technology will become superior to humans
point at which man and machine merge into one is *referred* to by @entity20 as " *singularity* "
