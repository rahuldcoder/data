-- " @entity2 " collective @entity0 on thursday took credit for taking down @entity5 @entity4 , @entity6 and entertainment company websites , following arrests in one of the federal government 's largest anti-piracy crackdowns			1
federal agents earlier in the day arrested the leaders of @entity14 and shut down the popular hub for illegal media downloads			1
hours later , some of @entity14 's fans turned the table on the feds			1
@entity0 said it set its sights on the @entity5 @entity4 and the @entity6			1
both sites appeared to be back up late thursday , but portions of @entity6 were not readily available			1
a law enforcement official told @entity1 the @entity6 was investigating			1
@entity0 said 10 websites in all were targeted			1
" we @entity0 are launching our largest attack ever on government and music industry sites			1
@entity34 , " the group said in a statement posted late thursday on an associated @entity33 account			0
" the @entity6 did n't think they would get away with this did they ? they should have expected us			1
" the group also posted personal information on former @entity40 sen. @entity39 , chairman of the @entity41 , one of the targeted sites			2
a @entity4 spokesperson , who did not want to be identified , said its web server was " experiencing a significant increase in activity , resulting in a degradation in service			1
" " the department is working to ensure the website is available while we investigate the origins of this activity , which is being treated as a malicious act until we can fully identify the root cause of the disruption , " the spokesperson said			2
the website glitches came soon after various @entity33 accounts associated with the collective took aim at the government			1
@entity0 ' favorite weapon for these attacks is what 's called a " distributed denial of service " ( @entity68 ) attack , which directs a flood of traffic to a website and temporarily crashes it by overwhelming its servers			1
it does n't actually involve any hacking or security breaches			0
" one thing is certain : expect @entity5 ! # @entity14 " read one tweet from @entity78 that went out midafternoon			0
one hour later , the same account tweeted a victory message : " @entity82 ! http://universalmusic.com & http://www.justice.gov / / # @entity14 " speaking of the web attacks , an @entity0 representative said 5,635 people used a networking tool called a " low orbit ion cannon			1
" a @entity88 is a software tool that aims a massive flood of traffic at a targeted site			2
the news comes as lawmakers have turned their attention to anti-piracy legislation			0
protests erupted both online and offline this week against two bills under consideration in @entity101 : the @entity103 's @entity102 ( @entity102 ) and the @entity105 's @entity104 ( @entity104 )			2
the bills are aimed at cracking down on copyright infringement by restricting access to sites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content			0
but the legislation has created a divide between tech giants , who say the language is too broad , and large media companies , who say they are losing millions each year to rampant online piracy			0
( @entity121 , the parent company of @entity1 , is among the industry supporters of the legislation			0
) on @entity33 , @entity124 said thursday 's attacks meant an " involuntary blackout " for sites of @entity102 supporters			2
@entity130 's website went down thursday afternoon			1
the music company had been locked in a legal battle with @entity14 over a @entity134 video that featured many of @entity130 's signed artists promoting @entity14 's site			2
the websites of the @entity139 and @entity41 were out of action thursday afternoon , but they appeared to be back up later in the evening			0
a spokesman for @entity139 cast the attack as a minor hiccup			0
" the fact that a couple of sites might have been taken down is really ancillary to the significant news today that the @entity4 brought down one of the world 's most notorious file - sharing hubs , " he said			1
the @entity0 attack came soon after the @entity4 announced the indictment of seven individuals connected to @entity14 for allegedly operating an " international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works			1
" authorities said the operation had generated more than $ 175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships			0
according to the indictment , @entity14 , which launched in 2005 , was once the 13th-most visited website on the @entity165 , serving as a hub for distribution of copyrighted television shows , images , computer software and video games			2
the site 's popular @entity14 subsidiary was widely known in tech circles for its copious selection of pirated content , including recent movies and episodes of hit tv shows			2
four of those indicted were arrested thursday in @entity181 , @entity182 , at the request of the @entity5			0
three others remain at large			0
the individuals indicted are citizens of @entity182 , @entity186 , @entity187 and the @entity188			0
no @entity5 citizens were named			0
however , @entity14 has servers in @entity191 , @entity192 , and @entity193 , which prompted the @entity192 - based investigation			0
to shut down @entity14 , federal authorities executed 20 search warrants in eight countries , seizing 18 domain names and $ 50 million worth of assets , including servers in @entity192 , @entity193 , the @entity188 and @entity201			0
in some of its attacks , @entity0 has targeted governments or companies it says are part of or support a police state			1
the list of police officers and agencies targeted by the collective is long			2
from @entity212 to @entity213 , @entity214 , police websites have been hacked ; personal information , including the home addresses of specific police officers , was posted online in 2011			0
@entity1 's @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report			0

@entity0 chides @entity6
federal agents arrest leaders of popular hub for illegal downloads
hours later , @entity4 's website *knocked* offline
