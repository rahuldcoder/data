@entity0 -- federal and state governments should move to a single lethal drug for executions instead of complex cocktails that can be botched , a group of criminal justice experts said in a new review of the death penalty in the @entity11			1
the experts also recommended that governments should let the public know more about their processes in carrying out the death penalty			1
the report comes as the @entity17 conducts a review of federal and state death penalty procedures , including the drugs used , following a botched execution in @entity22 last week			1
documents : not enough left to finish botched execution the @entity25 published the report called " @entity27 , " the work of bipartisan group of experts , including former elected leaders who oversaw executions , and anti-death penalty activists			1
the study was already in the works before the failed execution in @entity22			2
the group does n't take a position on whether the death penalty should be used , but rather suggests ways to improve the system , the @entity25 says , to ensure it is being carried out fairly			1
" without substantial revisions -- not only to lethal injection , but across the board -- the administration of capital punishment in @entity11 is unjust , disproportionate and very likely unconstitutional , " former @entity43 @entity42 attorney general @entity42 , a member of the committee that produced the report , said in a statement			2
former @entity53 gov. @entity52 , a @entity54 and death penalty supporter who co-chaired the committee , said in a recent opinion piece in @entity59 that he regrets airing an election ad in which he boasted of overseeing the executions of 19 people during his time in office			1
among its 39 findings , the report warns that executing people convicted of felony murder violates the @entity68 to the @entity69 , which bans cruel , unusual and excessive punishment for crimes			0
in some states , someone could be convicted of felony murder without killing or even intending or attempting to kill , the report says			0
" including accidental and non-intentional murderers among the death - eligible creates perverse outcomes â € ” those least " deserving " of a death sentence can be sentenced to die while premeditated and intentional murderers may avoid capital punishment , " the report says			2
the report suggested improving clemency procedures and better access to the courts for defendants on death row			0
the report also takes on the issue of executing people suffering from mental retardation , which the @entity91 banned in 2002			0
some states , the report says , have overly stringent standards for people to be declared mentally handicapped			0
the move to a single lethal drug , the report says , would make sure the government is using " the most scientifically reliable methods to minimize pain and suffering during an execution			1
" states also should make public what drug is used and allow the public to have input on the process			0
currently , some states do not identify the drugs they use for lethal injections			0
some manufacturers refuse to allow their drugs for such use			0
court rules to keep lethal - drug sources secret the full report can be seen here .			2
