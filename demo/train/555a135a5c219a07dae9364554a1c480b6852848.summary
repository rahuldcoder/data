imagine you could let your city urinate in a cup and submit the sample to a laboratory for drug testing			2
would it pass ? researchers in @entity8 did something similar with 42 major cities , and many of them failed			1
lab tests on sewage water to detect chemicals excreted after drug use turned up high levels of cannabis , cocaine , ecstasy , meth and other amphetamines			1
the scientists ' results , published this week in the journal @entity25 , read like a top 10 list of @entity8 party capitals			1
some of them should come as no surprise to experienced travelers			0
@entity31 in the @entity32 , for example , where smoking cannabis is tolerated -- though not legal -- in its trademark coffee shops , hovered near the top of the list in every category but meth			1
the port city , also saddled with the reputation of a red - light district hub , took second place in levels of ecstasy excretions found in wastewater , according to the study led by the @entity49			1
as for cannabis , a lesser - known town bumped @entity31 to second place			1
the top spot for traces of pot in wastewater went to the @entity58 city of @entity59 , population 265,000			2
serious problems the study may seem like a review of dereliction hot spots , but its aim is serious : to help detect dangerous addictions and spikes in the use of certain illicit drugs			2
multiple governmental authorities , drug prevention councils , universities and laboratories participated in the research			2
the scientists are hoping to develop a useful monitoring tool			0
it 's hard to get solid data on drug usage , because it 's traditionally gathered via questionnaires , the study said			0
respondents can fudge the answers or forget details			0
drug users also sometimes do n't know what they are really taking or whether other drugs are mixed in			1
the laboratory analysis of wastewater has the potential to get more accurate results more quickly and detect new drugs spreading into a local market			0
@entity98 cocaine , @entity100 meth the study reveals apparent preferences for certain drugs in certain regions			1
particularly high levels of benzoylecgonine , the main metabolite of cocaine , turned up in the wastewater of @entity31 , the @entity109 city of @entity110 , @entity98 and @entity111			1
@entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 , @entity115 , were not far behind			0
@entity98 sewage also turned up high levels of ecstasy , but the @entity120 capital did not stick out on the list of the other drugs tested for			1
there were no measurements taken there for cannabis			0
the @entity32 swept the top three on the list of ecstasy remnants gone down the drain , according to the analysis , but was much further down the list for meth concentration			2
that drug appears be prevalent in the @entity135 , @entity136 and parts of @entity138			0
the highest concentration of meth excretions showed up in @entity100 's wastewater , but in all other categories , the @entity135 city landed in the mid-teens			0
the @entity115 team turned in results that indicate that ecstasy is a weekend drug in that country			2
its excretion levels in wastewater crept along during the week and then rocketed on fridays , peaked sundays and nosedived mondays			0
from toilet to tap : getting a taste for drinking recycled waste water			0

researchers tested sewer water for drug excretions in 42 @entity8 cities
notorious party capitals turned up high levels of drug use , particularly in the @entity32
certain drugs appear to be popular in some cities and not in others
high traces of cocaine turned up in @entity31 , @entity110 , @entity98 and @entity111
