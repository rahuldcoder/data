-- i have so few images of myself as a baby that 30 years ago , when i first picked up a camera , i never could have imagined that my imagery of other babies would resonate around the world			0
since then , i 've been fortunate to photograph thousands of children , and within these images i 've always tried to convey the purity , beauty and innocence of the newborn			2
i truly feel that they represent the very essence of our existence and when they are with me in my studio they always bring joy to my heart			0
the vulnerability of the newborn -- without care , nourishment , love and attention they can not survive -- is a fact of life			0
every mother reading this will remember the moment when she first gazed into the eyes of her baby			0
out of that fog which can constitute childbirth , we are not only automatically transported into our new lives as mothers , but that essential nurturing instinct instantly becomes part of us , as we promise ourselves that we will do everything we can to protect the new life we have created			2
and after giving birth , we as women become members of the vast sisterhood of mothers -- a universal oneness ; a shared experience to which we can all relate			2
as the global advocate for the @entity57 's @entity56 campaign , and as a part of my commitment to support the @entity61 initiative , this @entity53 i ask all mothers to pause for a moment			1
spare a thought for another mother in the world who feels exactly the same way about her own child as you do about yours , yet is helpless to protect them against common diseases such as measles , pneumonia , diarrhea or polio			0
@entity56 aims to help save the lives of the 1.5 million children under the age of 5 who die every year from diseases that are entirely preventable by vaccines			1
please do n't be overwhelmed by these statistics -- within your heart just imagine one child and one mother			0
it is very difficult for any parent in a developed country to comprehend that $ 20 can save the life of a child			1
put yourself in another mother 's shoes			0
if someone were to say to you , " i can save the life of your child for $ 20 , " what would your response be ? @entity56 aims to save the lives of 1,000 children by @entity53 , and i think we can achieve this goal			1
if just 1,000 people gave $ 20 each in celebration of @entity53 , we could save the lives of 1,000 children			1
how hard can it be ? a thousand children saved , and the pain of a thousand mothers eased			1
collectively , our babies are a compelling and persuasive symbol of hope and the transforming power of unconditional love			0
let 's make sure that all of our children live to realize their potential			1
together we can all make a difference			0
