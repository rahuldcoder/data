@entity1 sen. @entity0 broke with members of his party tuesday , lauding the release of the @entity6 's report on torture and decrying the use of torture as having " stained our national honor " and doing " much harm and little practical good			1
" @entity0 , a survivor of torture himself from his naval service during the @entity17 , said from the @entity6 floor that the techniques outlined in the report " not only failed their purpose -- to secure actionable intelligence to prevent further attacks on the @entity23 and our allies -- but actually damaged our security interests , as well as our reputation as a force for good in the world			1
" many republicans have argued against releasing the report , especially as the threat of the @entity35 in @entity36 and @entity37 grows , and @entity23 intelligence officials have warned that its release could cause backlash from nations and groups hostile towards the nation			1
@entity23 embassies in the @entity46 have been put on heightened security alert for its release			2
@entity0 said that while " the truth is a hard pill to swallow ... the @entity23 people are entitled to it			1
" and he acknowledged that violence against the @entity23 from the " muslim world " is " possible ... perhaps likely " but argued that @entity23 's enemies " hardly need an excuse " to attack the nation , so the good done by the release of the report should trump any security concerns			1
" this report strengthens self - government and , ultimately , i believe , @entity23 's security and stature in the world , " he said			2
during his comments , @entity0 referenced his own experience with torture and argued that it " produces more misleading information than actionable intelligence " and that " we can and we will " win the war on terrorism without such techniques			1
but he argued that the @entity23 should n't resort to such tactics not just because they 're ineffective and potentially dangerous but because they undermine the nation 's values and beliefs			0
" i have often said , and will always maintain , that this question is n't about our enemies ; it 's about us			0
it 's about who we were , who we are and who we aspire to be			0
it 's about how we represent ourselves to the world , " he said			0
@entity0 added , " when we fight to defend our securit , y we fight also for an idea ... that all men are endowed by the creator with inalienable rights			2
" " our enemies act without conscience			0
we must not , " he added .			0
