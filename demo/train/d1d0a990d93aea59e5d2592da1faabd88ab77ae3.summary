@entity0 -- just so you know , @entity1 says he 's not the anti-christ			1
@entity1 says most of the @entity4 is a forgery but it 's still an important body of work			1
he says he 's not trying to destroy your faith			1
he 's not trying to bash the @entity10			1
and , though his mother no longer talks to him about religion , @entity1 says some of his best friends are @entity14			1
@entity1 , a best - selling author and a professor of religious studies at the @entity17 at @entity18 , is a biblical sleuth whose investigations make some people very angry			1
like the fictional @entity23 character played by actor @entity24 in the movie " @entity26 , " he delves into the past to challenge some of @entity29 's central claims			1
in @entity1 's latest book , " @entity31 , interrupted , " he concludes : doctrines such as the divinity of @entity31 and heaven and hell are not based on anything @entity31 or his earlier followers said			1
at least 19 of the 27 books in the @entity4 are forgeries			1
believing the @entity10 is infallible is not a condition for being a @entity14			2
" @entity29 has never been about the @entity10 being the inerrant word of @entity40 , " @entity1 says			2
" @entity29 is about the belief in @entity31			2
" critic : ' there 's a touch of arrogance ' about him @entity1 's claims have found an audience , and controversy			1
he 's a fixture on @entity52 and @entity53 documentaries on @entity29			1
he 's appeared on @entity54 , @entity0 and the @entity55 and talked about scribes misquoting @entity31 on " @entity57 with @entity58			1
" yet @entity1 's popularity also may be due to a larger trend			1
the books of people like @entity63 , author of " the @entity65 , " and @entity66 , author of " the @entity67 " and " @entity68 , " resonate with people who believe there are parts of the @entity10 that the church left on history 's editing floor			1
some scholarly critics say @entity1 is saying nothing new			2
bishop @entity77 , an author and @entity79 bishop based in @entity80 , says he does n't like the " breathless tone " of @entity1 's work			1
" he keeps presenting this stuff as if this is wonderful new knowledge that has been kept from you backward lay people and this is the stuff your preachers do n't have the guts to tell , and i have , " @entity77 says			2
" there 's a touch of arrogance in it			1
" yet even many of @entity1 's critics say he has a knack for making arcane @entity4 scholarship accessible to the public			1
" he has a gift for clear thinking and an ability to present some complicated things in simple , direct ways , " @entity77 says			0
some pastors also say that @entity1 forces them to confront tough questions about the @entity10 in front of their congregations			0
" his take on the scriptures is a gift to the church because of his ability to articulate questions and challenges , " says rev. @entity108 , a blogger who also happens to be a @entity110 minister in @entity111 , @entity112			1
" it gives us an opportunity to wrestle with the [ @entity10 's ] claims and questions			1
" @entity1 : there was no resurrection @entity1 says that no one accepts everything in the @entity10			0
he cites some @entity4 's references to the role of women in church as an example			1
in the first book of @entity137 , @entity1 says , the @entity135 insists that women should remain silent in church ( 1 @entity137 14:35 - 36 )			1
in the 16th chapter of the book of @entity142 , @entity135 's attitude is that women could and should be church leaders -- and he cites women who were serving as deacons and apostles in the early church , @entity1 says			1
@entity1 backs his arguments with a deep knowledge of the culture and history of the @entity4 world			1
he 's written 20 books on early @entity29 and is an authority on ancient manuscripts used to translate the @entity10			1
his claims , though , take on some of @entity29 's most sacred tenets , like the resurrection of @entity31			1
@entity1 says he does n't think the resurrection took place			0
there 's no proof @entity31 physically rose from the dead , and the resurrection stories contradict one another , he says			1
he says he does n't believe the followers of @entity31 saw their master bodily rise from the dead , but something else			0
" my best guess is that what happened is what commonly happens today when someone has a loved one die -- they sometimes think they see them in a vision , " @entity1 says			0
" i think some of the disciples had visions			0
" @entity1 says he immerses himself in the @entity10 , though he does n't believe in its infallibility , because it 's the most important book in @entity182 civilization			1
" i have friends who teach medieval @entity184 , " he says			0
" they do n't believe in @entity187 , but they think @entity187 is important , " he writes in the conclusion of " @entity31 , interrupted			0
" the fundamentalist turns agnostic @entity1 once had a different attitude toward the @entity10			0
he was raised in the @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity193 , and became a @entity14 at age 15 when he met a charismatic @entity14 youth group leader who reached out to him			0
@entity1 says he later persuaded his parents to embrace a more conservative brand of @entity29			0
he says he became so devoted to the @entity10 that he memorized entire sections			0
he was convinced the @entity10 was " @entity40 's words			1
" but @entity1 says he began to develop doubts about the infallibility of the @entity10 after attending @entity202 to become a college @entity10 professor			1
he even began to change his opinion of the @entity14 youth group leader who helped convert him			0
the youth leader visited @entity1 's father when he was dying of cancer in a hospital			2
the youth leader used a bottle of hotel shampoo to " anoint " his father , and tried to persuade his father to confess specific sins , @entity1 says			0
@entity1 says he was angry at the minister for acting " self - righteous " and " hypocritical			2
" " for a vulnerable high - schooler who is trying to figure out the world , a personality like that is very attractive , " @entity1 says			2
" they 're like cult leaders			0
they have all the answers			0
" @entity1 says he later became an agnostic because he could n't find the answer to another question : how could there be a @entity40 when there is so much suffering in the world ? an agnostic is one who disclaims any knowledge of @entity40 , but does not deny the possibility of @entity40 's existence			2
today , @entity1 describes himself as a " happy agnostic			0
" but some people ca n't believe an agnostic can be happy , he says			0
they tell him that they 're praying for him			0
they say he 's being fooled by @entity244 and he 's headed to hell			2
some say he 's the anti-christ			2
" i 'm not that powerful , " he says , laughing			0
his family , however , feels no obligation to talk to @entity1 about his ideas on the @entity10 , @entity1 says			0
his mother , brother and sister remain conservative @entity253			0
he once tried to talk to his mother about his new beliefs , but the discussion proved fruitless			0
" my mom is a strong evangelical , " @entity1 says			2
we do n't talk religion			0
" still , @entity1 says he still sends his mother and siblings copies of his latest books			2
they 've never responded , he says			0
" i imagine they 're hidden in a back room , " he says			0
whether it 's his family , critics or students , @entity1 says he has a better handle on why he is so threatening to so many people -- some @entity253 worry they will make the same decision he has			2
" i changed my mind , " he says			0
" my students find me more dangerous that way			0
i really do know what they 're talking about when they stake out an evangelical position			0
