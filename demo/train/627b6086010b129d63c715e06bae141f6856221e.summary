-- from his early days as one of the first faces familiar to television audiences in the 1950s , as host of " @entity6 , " @entity1 was a constant			1
he was n't just a major force in television , but in the music industry as well , up until his death on wednesday at the age of 82			2
so it 's no wonder that @entity13 flooded in from those who worked closely with @entity1 , as well as those who only knew him as a friend who came into their living rooms , whether it be each week or only each @entity20			1
@entity1 was involved with so much , from various award shows , to the popular " @entity23 " game show , to " @entity24 , " that only focusing on one reason he was so loved by so many just is n't enough			1
even three reasons does n't cover it			2
so here are ten reasons -- counting down , like he did to the new year -- why @entity31 loved @entity1 : 10			1
he was humble @entity33 worked with @entity1 in the 1980s			1
she well recalls him wearing a name tag to his own holiday party			0
" i was watching @entity0 and my son asked who the man on television was and i told him ' actually he was my boss			2
' and my son did n't believe me			0
so i pulled out this photo yesterday and here he was wearing a name tag			0
i thought it was really endearing			0
" she also said that her fondest memory of @entity1 was when he gave her his first desk after he moved to the west coast for ' @entity6			1
' she inquired about the piece of furniture with the office manager and a few days later @entity1 was at here desk			1
" he said , ' i heard you want my desk , ' and i said i would pay , but he said i did n't have to pay for it , " she said			0
" he helped me load his antique desk into my car , " she said			0
" he would show random acts of kindness like that			0
" he broke color barriers " @entity61 , the legal steward for the late @entity62 of the @entity63 , the @entity64 , put it this way : " what artist of color did n't have some association with @entity1 over the years ? " @entity1 is widely credited with integrating his audience on " @entity6 " and , according to @entity71 , @entity62 was one of those musical artists of color who credited @entity1 with their start			1
" the first comment i heard him make about @entity1 was , ' you know , we were one of the first black acts , if not the first , on his show in @entity83 before he went national , " she said			1
" as a little girl , watching television in @entity86 , i was not exposed to blacks in any positions of power or affluence , " said @entity84 of @entity85 , @entity86			2
" @entity1 was an inspiration when he fought for the integration of his show , first for the performers on his show and later adding dancers of different races			1
i know he helped to launch the careers of some great black performers , but you may not see the impact he had on the poor underprivileged children of the ghettos around the country who did not know that they could be more than what they could see around them			0
he introduced generations to music @entity112 from @entity113 , @entity114 , was one of many loyal viewers of " @entity6			1
" " i watched the show every weekend , and because of the show , i heard music that i normally would n't have because i could n't afford to buy records or a radio			0
" @entity112 was inspired by " bandstand : " the now singer / songwriter also goes by the stage name of @entity124			0
he was a teenage staple every afternoon , @entity127 from @entity128 , @entity126 would switch on @entity6 at home , and dance to @entity131 , learning to do " the @entity132 " and " the @entity133			1
" " i will never forget march 1967 when the @entity135 's @entity134 and @entity136 were debuted on ' @entity6			1
' @entity135 new look and sound was eerie , strange , a little frightening but oh so very exciting			0
this was a big change for the music industry			0
" @entity143 described " bandstand " as " the part of my day that i looked most forward to , ' she said			0
" no one can take his place			0
he was a mentor @entity149 is a member of @entity151 , who hit it big in the 1960s			1
he worked with @entity1 for several years and describes @entity1 as being a wonderful and close friend			1
@entity151 describes one of his fondest memories with @entity1 when he and his band were at a shoot for the ' 60s @entity161 show , " @entity162			1
" " he 's my guy			0
we saw each other six weeks ago , and i ca n't even believe he is gone			0
" he said his heart sunk when he heard the news of @entity1 's passing			1
" when you get older you want to spend time with the people you are close to , and you keep putting things off because you always think you are going to have another day			0
" he said he is really glad he had the chance to see @entity1 six weeks ago			1
" you need to always tell your friends how much they mean to you , " he said			0
" that is what i learned from this situation ... i gave him a hug and told him everything i have and everything i am i owe to him			0
he was forever young @entity182 remembered thinking about how ageless @entity1 seemed on television when she tuned in to watch his show			1
her fondest memory of @entity1 was when she would throw dance parties at her house with her neighbor friends while they watched " @entity6 " in the afternoon			1
" i remember always thinking how @entity1 never seemed to age from year to year and i wondered how he did that			2
good living and being a good person , that must have been what it was			0
he was a dancer 's best friend when @entity200 was a teenager , she was living in @entity201 , but she was travelling to @entity202 to dance on @entity1 's show			1
her brother , who lived in @entity205 at the time , managed to get her and her friend passes to " @entity6			1
" she found herself in @entity1 's office with his now wife , @entity208 , who was also from @entity201			2
@entity1 and @entity208 told @entity200 she could come by the show whenever she wanted			2
during the 1970 's @entity200 danced on the show 32 times			0
dancers still have @entity1 to thank , as he produced the @entity214 television series " @entity215			1
he was the perfect host @entity216 was a @entity217 dj living in @entity218 during the 1960s " @entity219 , " and looked up to @entity1			1
" some entertainers are trained in broadcast schools , some get lucky and just land a broadcast job on the spur of the moment , others get there because of who rather than what they know and the right connections , etc. , " said @entity216 , now living in @entity230 , @entity205			0
" but @entity1 made it to the top of his profession because he was the right guy at the right time on the right show and @entity218 and the world 's most popular television music program ! " 2			1
he was great to work for @entity238 , a contractor in @entity240 , @entity241 , worked for @entity1 in his @entity243 home in the mid- 1980s			2
having grown up on " @entity6 , " he was " thrilled " to work for him			2
" mr. @entity1 called me at home and told me personally how much he appreciated the extra time and work it took to get [ his ] specialty lighting purchased , delivered and installed on time , " he said			2
" he gave me his home phone number and told me that if i should ever need anything that he could do for me that i should never hesitate to call on him			0
i have worked with many celebrities over the years but he was far and away the kindest , most thoughtful gentleman of all the celebrities i have ever met or had the pleasure to work with			0
he gave people opportunities @entity258 , back when she was known as @entity260 , had a song played on " @entity6 " in the 1980s			2
" he said my name so sweetly : he was thoughtful , and concerned with the kids saying it was okay			0
" unfortunately , the record got a lukewarm response , but " @entity1 looked right into the camera , and told me he liked it and for me to keep plugging			2
a very generous , kind man			0
