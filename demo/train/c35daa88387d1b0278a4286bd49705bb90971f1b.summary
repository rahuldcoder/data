@entity0 -- on a recent visit to @entity5 , @entity3 prime minister @entity2 had this to say about @entity7 , historically a close friend of the @entity9 's : " we can not tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able , in any way , to promote the export of terror , whether to @entity5 or whether to @entity18 or anywhere else in the world			1
" seen by the @entity7 government as a slap in the face , @entity2 's remarks almost caused a diplomatic breach in relations between the two countries			0
his remarks followed the leaking of @entity31 documents on the @entity33 website in which @entity7 's @entity34 was accused of secretly aiding and inflaming the @entity36 insurgency in @entity18 , and they engendered a heated debate in @entity39 capitals on whether @entity7 is a friend or a foe			1
the dominant narrative in the @entity9 now is that @entity7 is a foe , playing a double game , guiding the @entity18 insurgency with a hidden hand even as it receives more than $ 1 billion a year from @entity47 for its help in combating @entity49 and like - minded groups			2
" the burden of proof is on the government of @entity7 and the @entity34 to show they do n't have ongoing contacts " with the militants , said @entity31 sen. @entity51 , a @entity52 on the powerful @entity53 who visited @entity7 this month			2
during a july visit to @entity7 , secretary of state @entity60 publicly aired @entity47 's suspicion and mistrust of its ally by stating that she believed that someone in the @entity7 government knew where @entity49 chief @entity67 was hiding in the country 's tribal regions along the border with @entity18			2
@entity72 's statement was an implicit indictment of @entity7 's double game ; it was met with angry denials by @entity7 leaders , who said the @entity31 undervalued their support and sacrifice in battling @entity49			0
what this simplistic argument neglects is that @entity7 serves its own vital national interests and cooperates with the @entity9 only to advance those interests			0
an underlying premise in inter-state relations is that nations have only interests and no permanent friends			0
that is the game nations have played since the establishment of the state system in the @entity92 in 1648			0
@entity7 's foreign policy is a case in point			0
throughout the @entity97 rivalry between the @entity31 - led western alliance and the @entity100 camp , @entity7 allied itself with the @entity9 and fought devastating wars against @entity5 , its strategic rival and a close friend of communist @entity104 and @entity106			1
the @entity7 leadership leveraged the @entity97 to extract military and technical aid from the @entity31 and the @entity39 powers			0
when @entity100 troops invaded @entity18 , @entity7 acted as @entity31 's spearhead in the fight against the " evil empire , " and its @entity34 was in charge of the @entity116 's expansive campaign to train , arm and guide the @entity18 mujahedeen , including the @entity67 contingent of the @entity120			1
more than any other power , @entity7 played a key role in the armed resistance that turned @entity18 into @entity106 's @entity124			0
in return , @entity7 's security forces received logistical and financial aid from the @entity31 , but more important , @entity7 gained the upper hand in @entity18 , becoming a paramount arbiter of its neighbor 's internal affairs			1
after the @entity100 forces retreated in defeat in 1989 and @entity18 plunged into all - out civil war , @entity7 leaders felt deserted by the @entity31 and had to pick up the shattered pieces and bring about a measure of stability to the war - torn country			1
once the @entity100 collapsed , the @entity31 had no interest in either @entity18 or @entity7 , relics of the @entity97			1
@entity7 relied on the @entity36 , a student - led @entity144 - based social movement that burst into the scene and imposed a draconian order wrapped in an @entity144 emirate in @entity18 in the 1990s			1
@entity7 's @entity34 nourished a close connection with the @entity36 and consolidated its hegemony over the broken country			0
although @entity7 was a close friend of the @entity31 's from the 1950s until 1989 , the 1990s marked the beginning of suspicion and distrust between the two countries			0
the @entity7 leadership , particularly the security apparatus , felt scorned and abandoned by its former superpower patron , which cut @entity7 off from military aid because of its nuclear weapons program and threatened to impose sanctions on it			0
there is more to the relationship between @entity7 and the @entity9 than the simple dichotomy of " either / or			0
" for example , since last year , @entity31 officials say the @entity7 military has launched a powerful offensive against the @entity7 @entity36 , who are allied with the @entity18 @entity36 , because the former began to threaten the current @entity7 government			1
( the @entity7 military has suffered more than 2,000 casualties , and hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens have been displaced			0
) the @entity7 military insists that it is waging all - out war against both @entity49 and its extremist allies -- the @entity7 @entity36 -- and @entity31 officials concur that they have seen a shift in the country 's attitudes toward the @entity36 in the past 18 months			1
on the other hand , the @entity7 military appears to be reluctant to attack the @entity18 @entity36 , as the @entity9 demands , because it wants to leverage the @entity36 in any future settlement in @entity18			1
for the @entity7 leadership , the @entity18 @entity36 are an important bargaining card , a strategic reserve on which they could rely when @entity39 troops exit the war - torn country			2
like their @entity39 nemesis , the @entity18 @entity36 bitterly complain that the @entity7 are playing a " double game " with them and say that they " feed us with one hand and arrest and kill us with the other			2
" there is no love lost between @entity7 and the @entity36 , a relationship based on self - interests and political considerations			2
@entity7 's strategic rivalry with @entity5 outweighs any pressure exerted by the @entity9 on @entity204 to end support for the @entity18 @entity36			1
@entity7 's conduct via @entity18 is driven by geostrategic concerns and fear of @entity5 influence in its backyard , not by intrinsic hostility or friendship toward the @entity9 or the @entity18 @entity36			1
if the @entity39 powers want to drive a wedge between @entity7 and the @entity18 @entity36 , they must address @entity7 's geostrategic concerns and interests via @entity5			1
an effective settlement of the @entity18 - @entity7 conflict must be region - wide and involve @entity5 , @entity7 , @entity18 , @entity220 and @entity104 , an almost impossible mission			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			0

@entity7 acted as @entity31 spearhead against @entity100 when it invaded @entity18
@entity228 says the @entity31 lost interest , leaving @entity7 to pick up pieces in @entity18
he says @entity7 relied on @entity36 to impose order on @entity18
he says @entity7 sees its interest tied to @entity36 and need to counter influence of @entity5
