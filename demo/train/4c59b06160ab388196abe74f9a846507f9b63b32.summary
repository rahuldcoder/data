-- on sunday , @entity1 released a new audio recording calling for @entity3 to kill @entity4 and @entity5			1
in it , an @entity1 spokesman states , " if you can kill a disbelieving @entity4 or @entity5 , especially the spiteful and filthy @entity8 , or an @entity9 , or a @entity10 or any other disbeliever , then rely upon @entity11 , and kill him in any manner or way however it may be			2
" last week 's federal indictment against @entity17 provides a reminder of the potential for acts of violence by @entity4 inspired by @entity23 's ideology that the new recording by @entity1 seeks to exploit			1
@entity17 , a 30 - year - old @entity4 citizen of @entity26 heritage who owns a pizza parlor in @entity29 , @entity30 , is accused of attempting to provide support to @entity1 and planning to attack @entity4 soldiers			1
in a new report which we helped co-author , the @entity35 's @entity34 , a successor to the @entity37 , assessed the current threat posed by such " homegrown " militants			1
since 9/11 , jihadist terrorists have killed 25 people in the @entity4			1
each one of those deaths is a tragedy , but none of these attacks were national catastrophes as 9/11 was			2
while @entity23 and its affiliates have failed to conduct any successful attacks in the @entity4 since 9/11 , they have sought to encourage action from militant @entity4 citizens , who might be more capable of carrying out terrorist operations in the @entity4 than foreign operatives given the stringent security measures now in place			1
unfortunately , this strategy of promoting homegrown extremism has demonstrated some successes , such as maj. @entity63 's killing of 13 people at the @entity65 , @entity66 , military base in 2009 and the 2013 @entity68 bombings , which authorities have said were carried out by @entity70 and @entity71			0
all of these were inspired by the propaganda of @entity74 , the @entity4 cleric killed in a 2011 @entity4 drone strike in @entity26 after he took up an operational role in @entity77			2
according to the @entity81 's research , an astonishing quarter of the 247 jihadist extremists charged since 9/11 either possessed copies of @entity74 's propaganda materials , cited him as an influence or were in communication with him			2
the influence of @entity74 and @entity77 's @entity88 @entity89 has persisted even after @entity74 's death			0
worrisomely , around 100 @entity4 have traveled to fight in @entity91 with opposition groups , including with @entity1 and the @entity23 - affiliated @entity93			1
so far , nine @entity4 have been charged with attempting to support or supporting @entity1 or @entity94 , according to a count by @entity96			0
in addition , at least two @entity4 have died fighting with these groups : @entity99 , who committed a suicide bombing in @entity91 for @entity93 , and @entity101 , who died fighting with @entity1			0
the difficulty @entity23 and similar groups have had in inspiring @entity4 to conduct attacks at home is due to the strength of systemic security checks , such as the willingness of @entity3 communities to report potential terrorist activity			1
a third of the extremists charged since 2001 were implicated by tips from family or local community members , according to an analysis by @entity96			0
of the 51 plots to conduct an attack inside the @entity4 since 9/11 , nearly half were initiated while the suspects were under surveillance by informants , according to a count by @entity96			1
the role that the @entity3 community has played as well as aggressive law enforcement efforts using informants have both helped to make the @entity4 a hard target for militants			0
add to these factors other measures taken since 9/11 ; the day that @entity23 's hijackers attacked the @entity135 and the @entity136 , there were only 16 people on the @entity4 no - fly list			1
today , there are more than 40,000			0
in 2001 , there were 32 @entity146 " fusion centers , " where multiple law enforcement agencies work together to chase down leads and build terrorism cases			0
before 9/11 , the @entity4 @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 did n't exist			1
in 2014 , all of these new institutions make it much harder for terrorists to operate in the @entity4			0
the @entity4 intelligence budget also grew dramatically after 9/11 , with @entity158 giving the government substantial resources with which to improve its counterterrorism capabilities			2
in 2013 , the @entity4 allocated $ 72 billion to intelligence collection and other covert activities			0
before 9/11 , the budget was around a third of that figure : $ 26 billion			0
in addition , greater public awareness of the danger posed by terrorism has also made the @entity4 a much harder target			2
it was his fellow passengers who tackled @entity174 , the " underwear bomber , " on christmas day 2009 as he tried to detonate a bomb on @entity176 as it flew over @entity177 .			0

new report seeks to assess threat of terrorist attacks in the @entity4
@entity183 says biggest risk is posed by *individuals* motivated by jihadist ideology
large - *scale* terror attacks such as 9/11 are less likely due to *increased* security , he says .
