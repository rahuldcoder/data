@entity7 has been in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years			1
@entity7 suffered irreversible brain damage in a car crash in 1992 , when she was 20 years old			1
for years , her father has fought to have her feeding tube removed , saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter 's life			1
@entity18 says that before the crash , his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she did n't want the same thing to happen to her should she ever be in the same state			0
euthanasia is illegal in @entity8 , but patients have the right to refuse treatment			0
it is on that basis that @entity7 argued his daughter should be allowed to die , because she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment , he said			1
" we knew @entity7 well , and we always thought of her as a champion of freedom , " her father said in october			2
" she had clear ideas about her life and for her , life was about freedom -- not an obligation to live			0
" a series of legal battles finally ended in november , when @entity8 's highest court , the @entity47 , upheld a lower court ruling allowing @entity7 to suspend his daughter 's treatment			0
but although @entity7 had cleared the last legal hurdle , the court 's decision sparked a new fight to find a hospital or clinic that would take out @entity7 's feeding tube			1
several clinics initially came forward to say they could do it , but the @entity8 health minister then issued a decree to remind them of their duty of care			0
under pressure to adhere to his decree , the clinics backed off			0
finally , a private clinic in the northeastern @entity8 city of @entity70 agreed to assist in @entity7 's case			1
monday night , @entity7 was transferred from the church - run hospital in @entity74 , north of @entity75 , where she had been kept alive to the @entity70 clinic			2
a handful of protesters tried to block the ambulance carrying @entity7 from leaving the clinic , one of them holding a banner reading , " only thieves and assassins act at night			2
" the case has been a controversial one in @entity8 , a heavily @entity85 country where the @entity86 has great influence			0
last sunday , pope @entity88 told pilgrims that " euthanasia is a false solution to suffering			0
" tuesday morning , a top @entity86 official was quoted in the @entity8 media saying , " stop the killer hands			0
" the @entity70 clinic says the removal of @entity7 's tube will begin in about three days , and the process of allowing her to die will take about 20 days			1
clinic officials gave police an outline of the specific steps they are going to take with @entity7 during that time			2
the outline adheres to the @entity104 's ruling , which required certain steps and conditions once @entity7 's feeding tube is removed			1
among the steps and conditions was a rule that no video or photography may be taken and that only certain people may enter the patient 's room .			0
