-- fans of fantasy franchises like " @entity3 " are famously devoted -- some might say fanatical			1
whether making an appointment with their television , staking out a bookstore , or lining up hours before a movie release , people who love diving into worlds of wonder go to great lengths get the goods			0
but it may not be " @entity3 " that has the most rabid fans			1
" @entity19 , " and its newest release , " the @entity21 , " boasts one of the most dedicated fan bases in all of entertainment			1
celebrating 20 years of adventures on the continent of @entity26 , the six releases in " @entity19 " series have given millions of players the opportunity to explore , create , and battle their way to glory			1
@entity31 , vice president of public relations and marketing for @entity34 , told @entity0 it is that willingness to give the player freedom that endears the game to its fans			1
" you get to make your own story versus everybody else presenting you something where you are playing their story , " @entity31 said			0
" i think that has continued to resonate with folks as gaming has gotten more popular			2
" those " folks " add up			0
there were more than 20 million copies sold for just one game in the franchise -- " the @entity53 : @entity53			1
" compare that to one of the most talked about fantasy book franchises , " @entity3			1
" @entity58 's @entity57 said it has sold more than 24 million copies of all five books in the series ... combined			1
if sales do n't impress you , how about sheer size ? @entity26 is roughly 7.54 million square miles of land for players to explore , while @entity67 ( home to much of " @entity3 " ) is thought to be about 800,000 square miles and @entity70 's @entity69 is 3 million square miles			1
wiki pages created by fans to showcase elements of " @entity19 " also dwarf the number of similar pages created for other fantasy stories			1
there are nearly 22,000 pages created for " @entity19 " -- more than " @entity79 " ( 4,944 ) , " twilight " ( 984 ) , and the @entity81 books ( 11,511 ) combined			1
when @entity34 asked for people to sign up to beta test their new multiplayer game , " the @entity21 , " 5 million people ( the equivalent of the population of @entity85 ) responded to the call			2
@entity31 said there were even attempts at bribery to get in , with one person offering their newborn child and their left arm			0
" we determined that was a bit too high a price to pay for a beta key , " @entity31 said with a laugh			0
" we have very loyal , enthusiastic , rabid fans that are really into what we are doing and want to be a part of it			2
" while body parts and trading children may be a bit extreme , @entity31 said there was another family who were so dedicated and loved the franchise so much that they made a life - long commitment after the release of " the @entity53 : @entity53			2
" " i made an off - hand joke that if anybody names their kid @entity118 ( the title given to the main character in the game ) you will get free @entity34 games for life , " @entity31 said			2
" and then somebody actually did			0
" @entity118 @entity126 was born on november 11 , 2011			0
sure , other babies have been named for fantasy characters			2
people have also held weddings in the style of their favorite fantasy land ( although a wedding in the style of " @entity3 " might be problematic )			1
but how many people can actually say they got married in @entity69 or @entity136 ? @entity31 said one couple has approached @entity34 with the request to get married inside " the @entity21 " game			0
" they are actually getting married , but they want to do the ceremony in ' the @entity21			0
' we 're still figuring out how exactly that works and what the ramifications are , " he said			0
and of course , the players want to talk about the game as well			0
" @entity19 " lead the way in that category as well			2
the series has more than 300,000 subscribers to @entity153 accounts across its various games			0
" @entity3 " has 298,196 and @entity81 has 142,389			2
and that does n't even take into account all the fan fiction pages spread out across the @entity160			0
" it 's just all over the place everywhere else , " @entity31 said			0
" there are blogs and forums and all kinds of places where people are writing their own story , their own fiction			0
" lest you think @entity31 to be a braggart , he did admit he has a great fondness for the " @entity3 " books and television series			1
he said many fans of " @entity19 " also follow the adventures in @entity178 and @entity69			1
" there are @entity81 fans who are @entity19 fans			1
there are @entity19 fans who are @entity81 or ' @entity3 ' fans , " @entity31 said			1
" it never has to be an either - or			0
