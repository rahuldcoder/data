editor 's note : @entity2 , a columnist for the @entity3 , won the 2004 @entity4 for commentary and is the author of a new novel , " before i forget " and " becoming @entity8 : @entity9 and the @entity10			1
" @entity2 says we know what it takes to improve the performance of @entity16 students			1
( @entity17 ) -- back in 1972 , on an episode of " @entity20 , " @entity18 posed the following riddle to @entity22 and @entity23			2
father and son go driving			2
the father is killed instantly , the son is rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery			0
the surgeon walks in , takes one look at the patient and says , " i ca n't operate on this boy			0
" the answer to the apparent paradox eluded @entity22 , @entity23 and the guys down at @entity39 's bar for the balance of the half hour			1
they floated theories involving stepfathers , sons - in - law , priests , adoptions and returns from the dead			0
all of which @entity22 apparently found more believable than the true answer which was , of course , that the surgeon was the boy 's mother			1
" if that 's the answer , " he spouted , " that 's the dumbest riddle i ever hoid ! " thirty - seven years later it is , perhaps , difficult to appreciate why this riddle ever was a riddle , how so apparent an answer could have stymied @entity22 , @entity23 and , i would wager , the vast majority of the viewing audience			1
the riddle speaks volumes not just about how the world has changed in four decades , but also about how unconscious expectations can blind us to the obvious			1
in 1972 , one expected a man when one heard the word " surgeon			0
" much as , in 2009 , one expects a white kid when one hears the word " scholar			0
" people will deny this , will say all the right and politic things			1
but the disclaimers will be as thin and transparent as @entity76			0
black , white and otherwise , we are all socialized by the same forces and all carry , by and large , the same unconscious assumptions			1
one of which is that a certain level of achievement is black and another is white			1
this is what you are hearing when a black kid speaks standard @entity88 and another black kid chides him for " talking white			1
" this is what @entity92 was alluding to when he decried " the soft bigotry of low expectations			1
" and this is what we need to address forthrightly if we ever hope to close the so - called achievement gap that looms between black kids and white ones			1
in 2007 and 2008 , i traveled the country for a series of columns called " what works , " aimed at profiling programs that addressed that gap			1
i traveled between big programs and small ones , from the @entity111 , which encompasses 90 square blocks of holistic education , family counseling , medical care and tutoring in @entity117 , to the @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 , which offers field trips , martial arts and academic enrichment in a rural county where the median income is $ 25,000 a year and the teen pregnancy rate is said to be 25 percent			1
i toured @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 , a @entity130 ( @entity131 in @entity132 , @entity133 , the @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136 , and many others			0
in all these places , i saw black kids -- well - spoken , clean - cut and noon - sun bright -- making a lie out of other peoples ' expectations			1
over the course of 13 months , common themes began to emerge whenever i would ask why kids such as these were doing such wondrous work in these places and substandard work elsewhere			0
we have more power to fire bad teachers and reward good ones , they said			0
we have a longer school day and a longer school year			0
we mentor children that need it			2
we counsel children and families that need it			2
we are invested in them and make sure they know it			0
most of all , they spoke of the simple power of expectation : making it a conscious point to look for greatness in black kids in whom people had not thought to look for it before			1
what i came to understand in those interviews is that we already know the secret to improving academic performance for @entity16 children			1
what is missing is the will to do so			0
and that , i think , is because where they are concerned , we have other expectations			2
i asked @entity191 , founder of the @entity111 , how he justifies asking for money to uplift poor kids in @entity194			0
his response struck me : " someone 's yelling at me because i 'm spending $ 3,500 a year on ` @entity197			2
' ' @entity197 ' is 8			0
ok , @entity197 turns 18			0
no one thinks anything about locking him up for 10 years at $ 60,000 a year			0
" but then , we expect @entity197 to be locked up , do n't we ? expect it so blithely that we will not challenge the expectation even when it works against our own economic self - interest			2
@entity204 , after all , presents a rather stark choice : invest a smaller amount early and produce a citizen who pays taxes and contributes to the system or pay a much larger amount later for the upkeep of a citizen who consumes tax monies and contributes nothing			2
that we consistently choose the latter says something about how we assess the educability , the salvageability , of @entity16 kids			0
thirteen months of interviewing young scholars left me more impatient than ever with a culture that writes off black kids because they are black kids			2
somewhere between the 13 - year - old in rural @entity120 who wants to go to @entity225 and the second - graders in @entity194 studying @entity227 , i ceased being surprised and started being angry that what i saw was still the exception and not the rule			0
everywhere i went , there were black kids excelling			2
and at some point , you say to yourself : well , of course			0
what did you expect ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2			1

@entity2 : unconscious expectations can blind us to the obvious
he says many people expect black students to perform more poorly
programs have demonstrated that investing in children 's education pays off
@entity2 : we already know secret to improve performance , but do we have will to do it ?
