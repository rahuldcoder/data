that 's what @entity1 promises in its newest @entity3 , which also has a new name : the @entity4			1
the company rolled out the fifth generation of its market - leading tablet tuesday			0
among its new features , the @entity3 will weigh 1 pound , down from 1.4 pounds			1
it 's 20 % thinner and 28 % lighter than the current fourth - generation ipad			2
the @entity4 will have the same 9.7 - inch screen as previous @entity3 and pack the same @entity12 processing chip that 's in the @entity13			1
that will make it 72 times faster than the original @entity3 , according to @entity1 senior vice president @entity16			1
" this is our biggest leap forward ever with a full - size @entity3 , " @entity16 said			1
the @entity4 will go on sale november 1			2
prices will start at $ 499 for a @entity22 - only model and go up to $ 629 for a @entity22 with @entity24 connectivity			0
@entity16 also announced a revamped @entity25 starting at $ 399			2
it will be available later in november in silver or space gray and will pack a speedy @entity12 processor and the same high - resolution " @entity30 " as bigger @entity3			1
@entity1 passes @entity32 as world 's ' top brand ' the older @entity25 is still around and will cost $ 299			1
and the full - size ipad 2 , launched in 2011 , is still available for $ 399			1
@entity1 took another new direction on tuesday , announcing that the newest version of its @entity39 operating system , @entity40 , is available now for download and will be free			2
selling @entity39 software has never been a huge money - maker for @entity1 , and the price of @entity46 upgrades had been dropping in the past few years			2
the move can be seen as a shot at @entity49 , which relies more heavily on revenue from sales of @entity52			0
new @entity54 and @entity55 laptops also were rolled out and go on sale immediately			0
they get the usual incremental updates : better graphics , longer battery life , faster flash storage and next - generation @entity22			0
@entity1 also announced that both @entity66 and @entity67 , their suites of office and creative software , are now free with the purchase of every new @entity39 and the super-powerful @entity69 , the desktop computer geared toward high - end graphics and video editing , finally got a price point -- $ 2,999 -- and will be released before the end of this year , according to @entity1 's @entity16			1
the @entity74 was designed in @entity75 and assembled in the @entity76 across 20 states			0
the pieces are probably manufactured out of the country and shipped to the @entity76 for the building stage			0
@entity1 's not the only tablet manufacturer with news this week			0
@entity49 officially launched its surface 2 and @entity74 2 tablets on tuesday morning , as did @entity85 with its own @entity87 device , the @entity88			1
the surface 2 starts at $ 449 , while the more powerful @entity91 will start at $ 899			0
is @entity1 's @entity92 a flop ? the @entity94 costs $ 499 and is @entity85 's first full - sized tablet			1
it 's also @entity85 's first big product rollout since it was announced that @entity49 was going to purchase part of the company			1
but as rivals catch up to the once - dominant @entity3 and the marketplace gets flooded with new tablets , it 's getting harder for competitors to set themselves apart			2
" tablets are a maturing market ; there 's not much competitors can do to differentiate at this point , " said @entity104 , a senior analyst at @entity105			0
" replacement sales are growing much , much faster than new sales worldwide , " she added			0
" you 're competing for customers you already have			0
" at tuesday 's event , @entity115 took a swipe at competitors with a reference that seemed most aimed at @entity49 's hybrid surface tablets			2
" they chased after netbooks , " he said			0
" now they 're trying to make pcs into tablets and tablets into @entity127 " the @entity4 will go on sale friday , november 1 at @entity1 retail stores in 42 countries and territories : the @entity76 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 ( @entity22 models only ) , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 ( @entity22 models only ) , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and the @entity174			1
