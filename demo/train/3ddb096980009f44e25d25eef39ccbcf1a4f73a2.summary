@entity0 , @entity1 -- " tell someone " : it 's the phrase most often modeled as the first step in stopping bullying			1
experts on the news , researchers and authors repeatedly suggest that victims or witnesses speak to someone about it -- whether it 's a classmate , a teacher , parent or friend -- the moment bullying becomes a concern			2
but at november 's @entity21 ( @entity22 ) conference , i received some pushback when i voiced the " tell someone " maxim			0
a teacher raised her hand and discussed a study that found that kids who do tell someone do n't think adults take the right action afterward			2
and for a moment , i asked myself , " then what ? " bullying has been around as long as schools have ; it 's far older than @entity35 , designer jeans and lunch money			2
there 's not a public school in the country where all the kids are nice in the eighth grade			0
( in fact , one student who commented on our blog at @entity46 wrote that whoever said sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me " has obviously never been to middle school			0
" ) at that age level , we were all insulted or called names ; some were shoved into lockers or tripped in the hallway ; others were n't welcome at certain lunch tables			2
because of technology , bullies are no longer stopped at the front door ; they can follow students to their rooms on their cell phones or online			1
video games have come a long way since @entity70 , evolving from cartoonish characters to ( in one popular case ) a simulator of terrorism			0
family dynamics are constantly changing			0
to be fair , i clearly remember fights at my suburban @entity0 high school , but they did n't result from random targeting			2
we had tears , but they did n't lead to any suicides			2
wherever the blame for it lies , today 's bullying is n't always a temporary condition to endure			1
it can be something that , for some kids , does n't get better and does n't go away , despite what graduates tell them			2
this is why it is crucial , according to educators and counselors at the @entity22 , that students themselves are involved in finding solutions to bullying			1
it 's their school , after all ; they represent the majority			0
it is the students who can speak to a schoolwide survey , for example , that asks what teachers and administrators have done to make the school better -- and what the students themselves have done to make the school better			1
it is the students who can suggest ideas for reducing the problem , and even if they 're not feasible , they can lead to discussions about solutions that are			2
so this is n't simply about kids seeing someone get bullied , telling an adult , and then stepping back and waiting for the problem to be fixed overnight			0
it takes time and student involvement			0
kids who witness bullying need to know that they have some power to determine the tide of it : it lies in how they respond			0
first , bystanders should n't support bullies with attention , laughter or anything that could make them proud of what they 've done			1
bullies are n't usually bullying out of anger ; they 're trying to get something they want , like approval or social status			1
and in general , they need witnesses for that			0
so bystanders who see bullying should respond in such a way that the bully feels isolated afterward -- not more powerful or popular , not encouraged			1
taking away the reward for the behavior can take away the inspiration for it			0
second , witnesses should support the targeted students			1
another takeaway from the @entity22 conference : victims who 've had someone defend them -- even if was just a single peer -- are better adjusted than undefended victims of bullying			1
so whether it 's through kindness to the victim , discouragement to the bully or alerting a teacher , if a bystander stands up for a victim , the latter will probably have more strength to cope			0
we already know what does n't work when trying to stop bullying			1
telling kids not to tattle does nothing to help them work through the problem ; telling them that the bully will grow out of it or that people get nicer in high school and in college -- even if that 's what we remember happening -- also falls on deaf ears			0
but empowering bystanders to take action can help alleviate the severity of bullying throughout the school			1
the bullies miss their rewards ; the victims feel someone 's on their side ; the witnesses , who make up most of the student body anyway , have a better learning environment			1
should targeted kids and witnesses still report the problem ? of course			0
but knowing how they can have a hand in its solution can inspire them to be part of it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			1
