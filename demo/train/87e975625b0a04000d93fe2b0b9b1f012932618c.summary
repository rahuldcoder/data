-- " i have a dream this afternoon that my four little children will not come up in the same young days that i came up within , but they will be judged on the basis of the content of their character , not the color of their skin			1
" the rev. @entity11 spoke these words in 1963 , but this was not the speech that would go down as one of the most important addresses in @entity18 history			1
@entity11 spoke these words in @entity20 , two months before he addressed a crowd of nearly 250,000 with his resounding " @entity24 " speech at the @entity25 on august 28 , 1963			1
several of @entity11 's staff members actually tried to discourage him from using the same " @entity24 " refrain again			1
10 signposts on @entity18 's race journey as we all know , that did n't happen			1
but how this pivotal speech was crafted is just one of several interesting facts about what is one of the most important moments in the 20th century in the @entity18 : @entity11 's speech almost did n't include " @entity24 " @entity11 had suggested the familiar " dream " speech that he used in @entity20 for his address at the march , but his adviser the rev. @entity43 called it " hackneyed and trite			1
" so , the night before the march , @entity11 's staff crafted a new speech , " @entity47			1
" @entity11 was the last speaker to address the crowd in @entity49 that day			1
as he spoke , gospel singer @entity50 called out to @entity11 , " tell ' em about the dream , @entity53			1
" then he paused and said , " i still have a dream			2
" @entity43 was out in the audience			2
" i said , ' oh , s ---			2
' " " i thought it was a mistake to use that , " @entity43 recalled			0
" but how wrong i was			0
it had never been used on a world stage before			0
" the rest , of course , is history			0
first page of a draft of @entity11 's " @entity24 " speech ( @entity66 ) handwritten text on back of " @entity24 " typed draft ( @entity66 ) the march almost did n't include any female speakers , either it was only after pressure from @entity74 , the only woman on the national planning committee , that a " tribute to @entity78 " was added to the official program			1
it took further convincing to have a woman lead it			0
@entity82 spoke in the place of @entity84 , the widow of slain civil rights leader @entity85			0
@entity86 , president of the @entity88 @entity87 who played a key role in integrating schools in @entity91 , told the crowd : " we will walk until we are free , until we can walk to any school and take our children to any school in the @entity18			0
and we will sit - on and we will kneel - in and we will lie - in if necessary until every @entity97 in @entity18 can vote			0
this we pledge to the women of @entity18			2
" earlier , @entity99 , an internationally known @entity18 entertainer who had moved to @entity100 to find fame , addressed the crowd			0
dressed in a military jacket draped with medals for her contribution to @entity100 resistance in @entity108 , she spoke in very personal terms about freedom : " you know i have always taken the rocky path			0
i never took the easy one , but as i get older , and as i knew i had the power and the strength , i took that rocky path , and i tried to smooth it out a little			0
i wanted to make it easier for you			0
i want you to have a chance at what i had			0
but i do not want you to have to run away to get it			0
" women had been central to the civil rights movement -- @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and many others -- but were only included in the program that day after one woman spoke up			1
opinion : did we really learn the lesson of the march on @entity49 ? the most prominent white speaker was called the " white @entity11 " @entity135 was the head of the @entity137 , which provided office space , staff and funding for the march in @entity20 and the @entity142			1
he was the seventh speaker listed on the program , and shared his remarks to the crowd			0
" we will not solve education or housing or public accommodations as long as millions of @entity97 are treated as second - class economic citizens and denied jobs , " he said			0
in 1998 , @entity151 included him in its list of @entity153			2
@entity154 , @entity135 's former administrative assistant , shared this popular story to explain who @entity135 was at the @entity142 : " standing close to the podium were two elderly women			2
as ( @entity161 ) was introduced , one of the women was overheard asking her friend , ' who is @entity135 ? ' the response : ' @entity135 ? he 's the white @entity11			1
' " an openly gay man organized the march in less than two months @entity167 is " the most important leader of the civil rights movement you probably have never heard of , " as @entity168 put it in his recent @entity0 column			2
not only did he organize the march in a matter of months , @entity167 is credited with teaching @entity11 about nonviolence			1
he also helped raise funds for the @entity177 and helped found the @entity178			2
during the time , his sexual orientation was known , and he was often in the background to prevent it from being used against the movement			0
fifty years after the march , @entity167 , who died in 1987 , will be honored with a posthumous @entity184 by president @entity185 in november			2
it was n't the first planned ' march on @entity49 ' labor leader and civil rights advocate @entity188 @entity187 had threatened a " @entity195 " on the @entity191 in 1941 to pressure then - president @entity192 to provide equal opportunity for defense jobs			1
@entity187 hired @entity167 to organize part of the march , which they felt was the only way to prompt action after numerous appeals			2
it worked : the march was called off after @entity192 established the @entity204 , abolishing racial discrimination in hiring			2
opinion : we 're closer to the @entity18 dream the march was a @entity213 star - studded event popular actor and singer @entity214 used his star power to help bring other celebrities to the march on @entity49			1
besides reaching out to the stars themselves , @entity214 went to many of the studio heads in @entity213 to get prominent actors and actresses temporarily released from their duties so they could participate			1
the @entity213 list of attendees that day read like a who 's who of a-listers : @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 , who also gave a speech			1
but having the @entity213 stars there was n't just for show or for increased media attention			1
it also helped calm president @entity242 's nerves about the march			1
" i believe that their presence did a lot to assuage people who were preoccupied with the fact there could be violence , " @entity214 said			0
" one of the things that i said in my conversations with the @entity254 in discussing why they should be more yielding in their support of our demonstration was the fact that there would be such a presence of highly profiled artists -- that that alone would put anxiety to rest , " he added			0
" people would be looking at the occasion in a far more festive way			0
" 5 faces of the march on @entity49 one march worker fell asleep during @entity11 's speech back in 1963 , college student @entity271 took a job answering phones for the march on @entity49 's planning office			1
she had 10 phone lines to answer , and they rang from the time she walked in until she left for the day			0
" i recall one day i 'll never forget , i heard someone say , ' where is this young lady who handles the phone ? ' and finally i looked up , and there he was -- dr. @entity11 -- and he said , ' i want to meet this young lady			1
she has put me on the hold twice , and hung up on me once , and i want to know who she is			0
' " @entity271 said she was " so embarrassed , " but then the civil rights icon gave her a hug			0
by the day of the march , she was so tired , she dozed off and accidentally slept through the historic march and the " @entity24 " speech			2
everything worked out for her in the end : @entity271 had a successful legal career and now teaches law at @entity294			0
the only class mlk ever taught another hitchhiked all the way from @entity298 only to have @entity11 check in on him @entity300 and two of his friends hitchhiked nearly 700 miles from @entity303 , @entity298 , to @entity49 to participate in the march			1
@entity300 , who was 15 years old at the time , was no stranger to the dark side of the civil rights movement			0
a few months earlier , he was struck by a cattle prod wielded by @entity298 police during anti-segregation demonstrations in @entity303			0
the three youths arrived in the nation 's capital a week before the march after three days of hitchhiking , and they were put to work making signs for the event			2
at one point , @entity11 walked in and asked for them			1
he had been in @entity303 the night before , and their parents had asked the civil rights leader to check on them			0
@entity11 sat down with the three and talked to them for about 20 minutes , asking them about their dreams , @entity300 later recalled			1
' @entity24 ' beat @entity242 's ' ask not what you can do ' speech there 's no doubt that @entity11 's speech was the most memorable part of the march on @entity49			1
it 's still taught in school , and memorized by children , half a century later			0
but how does it compare against other pivotal speeches by 20th century leaders , such as @entity242 or @entity192 ? well , a panel of more than 130 scholars got together in 1999 to rate the best speeches of the 20th century and @entity11 's speech ranked no. 1			1
what else have you learned about the march ? did anything surprise you ? share in the comments section below .			2

@entity11 almost did n't talk about " the dream "
women had to fight to be included on the speakers ' platform
