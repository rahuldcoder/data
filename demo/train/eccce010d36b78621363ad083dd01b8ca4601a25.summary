-- @entity1 might be aiming to replace @entity2 with @entity3 , but it looks like the " @entity6 " host is n't going down without a fight			1
@entity2 aimed one of his opening monologue jokes toward his employer wednesday , the same day that reports proclaimed @entity1 is hoping to move @entity12 to " tonight " by the fall of 2014			1
in doing so , " @entity6 " would also move back to @entity14 from @entity15			0
in light of all that chatter , @entity2 took the stage as the still - current host of " tonight " and cracked wise about @entity1 's sagging ratings			1
" scientists say they 're getting closer and closer to being able to do ' @entity23 ' - style cloning on extinct species -- things once thought to be extinct could now be brought back from the dead , " @entity2 said			1
" so , there 's hope for @entity1			1
" but if you 've been tuning in -- and it 's fair to assume that you might have , since " tonight " is still one of the shows that is performing well for @entity1 , noted @entity34 's vulture -- you know that @entity2 's been taking fire at the " peacock " network all week			1
on monday , he compared @entity1 execs to snakes in a holiday - themed @entity41 joke			2
" you know the whole legend of @entity41 , right ? " @entity2 said			2
" @entity41 drove all the snakes out of @entity45 , and then they came into the @entity46 and became @entity1 executives			2
" and then on tuesday , it was another light dig at @entity1 's poor performance			2
" did you hear about this ? a 28 - year - old woman from @entity53 has a rare brain condition where she sees everything upside down , " @entity2 said			2
" is n't that unbelievable ? she sees everything upside down			0
in fact , she thinks @entity1 is at the top of the ratings			0
" @entity12 also could n't escape the reports wednesday , and acknowledged them right off the top of his " @entity65 " monologue			1
" before we get started , i have to talk about the rumors that came out today which say that i 'll be moving up to 11:30 -- or as my parents call it , ' eh , it 's still too late , ' " he joked			0
" the rumors are true -- @entity1 is turning ' @entity6 ' into a diving competition			1
" ( @entity75 's " splash , " you might 've heard , premiered to nearly 9 million viewers on tuesday			0
) yet according to the @entity79 ' @entity78 , @entity12 's future as the new host of " tonight " is n't a done deal as much as it 's an understanding			1
" there 's no deal yet for the timetable of this , they have an understanding , " @entity78 told @entity0 's @entity84 wednesday			0
" i 'm sure @entity2 knows about the understanding			0
but @entity2 has a contract that goes until the fall of next year			0
i think from @entity2 's point of view , he will work until they tell him to stop			0
that 's the way he is ; that 's the kind of guy he is			0
" still , the idea of @entity12 getting the show is n't a surprise -- at least , not as much as the report that the show will move back to @entity14 from @entity15			1
" there 's a lot of reasons for it -- i think they all feel that the energy of @entity14 helps @entity12 , " @entity78 said			0
" but also you have @entity111 , who 's the producer of the show , and has always been close to @entity3 and he 's of course @entity14 - based			1
and then you have the band , @entity115 , and @entity115 are a @entity116 - based band , and some of the guys i think still commute to @entity14 , and they 're very important to that show and i do n't think they wanted to lose them			0

reports about @entity3 taking over " tonight " prompted late night jokes
on wednesday , @entity2 fired off more cracks about @entity1
@entity12 , meanwhile , *quipped* that " tonight " will become a diving show
