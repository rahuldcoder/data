-- wind power provides a fifth of @entity4 's electricity , most of it generated by giant wind farms built on land and in the country 's coastal waters			1
but the tiny @entity4 island of @entity12 is proving bigger is n't necessarily better by generating all its electricity using wind turbines of its own			1
nineteen miles off the coast of mainland @entity4 , 91 turbines reach 114 meters above the turbulent waters of the @entity20			1
together they form @entity22 , the world 's biggest offshore wind farm , which can generate enough electrify to power 200,000 homes			1
@entity26 is ceo of @entity27 , which operates @entity22			2
he told @entity0 that @entity4 's trailblazing efforts in wind power are the result of the country 's energy crisis during the 1970s			1
" the @entity4 were totally dependant on oil imported from the @entity34			2
suddenly there was an embargo , so no oil			0
we learnt the lesson the hard way that you have to have diversified supplies of energy			0
" the @entity43 says wind power currently provides 1.5 percent of the world 's electricity			1
that 's a drop in the ocean , but as a clean and renewable source of energy , wind power is receiving support from governments around the world			1
" i have to admit that the reason there is a business is that there are some government subsidies attached to wind production , " said @entity26			0
" that goes for @entity4 and that goes for other @entity63 countries where we are doing wind operations			2
" the @entity67 government recently announced that its economic stimulus bill contributed to a 39 percent increase in the country 's wind power output last year , defying predictions that new wind energy output would decline because of harsh economic conditions			1
" small wind " is also being promoted , with governments encouraging individual households to produce their own wind power using micro turbines			1
the @entity67 offers a 30 percent investment tax credit to people who buy micro turbines			2
many other countries offer grants for installing turbines , as well as feed - in - tariff payments that allow individuals to sell the electricity they generate to their national grid network			2
are wind farms an underused source of clean energy , or a blot on the landscape ? leave your comments in the " @entity98 " box at the bottom of this article			0
when it comes to small - scale renewable energy , the @entity4 island of @entity12 -- population 4,000 -- is an example to the world			1
among its energy - production facilities are 11 one - megawatt turbines on the island itself and 10 more turbines within three miles of its coast			2
as well as using wind turbines to provide electricity , and straw - burning plants to provide heating , some islanders have solar panels on their roofs and others warm their homes using geothermal energy and the heat given off by fresh cow 's milk			1
@entity128 , of the @entity129 , told @entity0 , " 100 percent of our electricity comes from onshore turbines			0
about 75 percent of our heating comes from heating plants and private people who have changed their oil furnaces to something renewable			0
" then we have the offshore turbines , which compensate for what we use in fossil fuels , heating and transport			0
all in all we send more energy to the mainland than we use			0
" two of @entity12 's turbines are owned by a co-operative of around 450 of the island 's residents			1
" [ they ] are the most important ones because they are the turbines that give the normal guy on the island the opportunity of investing in turbines , " said @entity128			0
while the residents of @entity12 can take advantage of their island 's blustery weather , open spaces and low - population density to be carbon neutral , the success of wind energy on a global scale may come down to simple economics			1
@entity4 company @entity168 is the world 's biggest supplier of wind turbines			1
its president for @entity172 , @entity173 , told @entity0 , " we are very focused on providing the lowest cost of energy			0
with the present system we are competitive with oil at $ 50 a barrel			0
" there is an expectation that prices will come down as turbines become cheaper and bigger companies throw their buying power into developing wind farms			2
@entity26 told @entity0 , " our initiatives , small company that we are , whatever we do wo n't change the world			0
" but if we can be a good example so that some of the big guys will do some of the same things then the implications can be much bigger			0
" what do you think ? should we all try to live like the @entity12 islanders ? have your say by leaving a comment in the @entity201 off box below .			0

a fifth of @entity4 's electricity comes from wind power
@entity22 is the world 's biggest offshore wind farm
the tiny island of @entity12 produces all its own electricity
@entity12 's residents can buy *shares* in two of the island 's turbines
