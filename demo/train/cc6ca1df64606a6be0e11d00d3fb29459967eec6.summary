-- i have never been whacked out on @entity2			0
however , if i had ever had the chance to meet @entity5 , a real acid pro , my fantasy is that during a brief conversation in which he got to know me a little bit i 'd feel comfortable asking him at the end of our talk : do you think i could handle acid ? even after i regaled him with the story of when friends of mine tried it in college , then wandered around the @entity19 and invented the rock n ' roll backpack -- which is a standard backpack with a radio boombox in it -- he would say no , you personally should n't take @entity2 , you suppressed malcontent			1
hopefully , this would all just sound like a sort of guttural gesture , because that would be subtle enough			0
there 's a definite chance that not only would hst think i could n't handle the drugs , but he might hate me entirely			1
i ca n't imagine someone who covered the @entity34 , shark fishing competitions , got to threaten the life of the man he hated more than anyone else on @entity39 ( @entity40 ) and helped get @entity41 elected president enjoying the company of me , a person who basically gets paid to tweet for a living ? i am not alone in my enduring fascination with @entity5			1
today the movie about the novel @entity5 started writing in 1959 at the age of 22 - years - old , " @entity51 " starring @entity52 , will be released			1
the film offers plenty of opportunities to remember the renegade journalist , such as @entity58 's recent piece titled " @entity5 was my brother in @entity60			1
" i get the continued curiosity			0
and while it 's fine that i ca n't write or take drugs like @entity5 , i actually did try to be like him once			1
in 2008 , after reading " the @entity69 , " the piece in which he invented @entity68 journalism , i wrote a three - part series for @entity71 called " @entity72 to @entity73 " in which i attended all three legs of the @entity75 in person			2
my experience was maniacal enough , but i wrote in a style that was caught up in the decadence and truly ignoring of the depraved			0
i too overindulged in gambling , alcohol , and some frat boy misogyny , took a full can of beer projectile to the collar bone and hung around women in fancy dress that were too blind drunk to know that they were knee deep in mud			0
yet with all that i still could n't capture his frenetic style			0
i was impressed by my own momentum but could never let it come unhinged , and if @entity5 himself read this report he would probably be nauseous at how upbeat it was			2
it 's cool that i failed , because everyone who tries to emulate his @entity68 genius falls short to a certain extent			1
recently , when she thrust herself into the annals of @entity106 , @entity103 from @entity104 wrote an excellent analysis on the currency of women 's breasts at the debauched music and arts festival held in some back corner of southern @entity114 ( see : " dropping in on the demented @entity115 " )			0
it was fine @entity68 reporting ; she had the @entity119 clown make - up and everything , but ended up with the determination that she could n't be one of these people			1
i ca n't help but wonder if @entity5 fraternized with the crazies on the aptly named " drug bridge " at @entity106 if we would have ended up making them his people -- and then they probably would have set off many , many explosives together			1
i suspect " @entity51 " will be released to mixed reviews			2
i wager most of the criticism will be directed at the fact that 48 - year - old @entity52 is attempting to play a 23 - year - old			0
and the @entity5 fans who see the film will get the subtext that this book is supposed to be @entity5 on the brink of finding his path to self - destruction			1
a time in his life when fear and loathing was just the fear			0
it was a time , pre- @entity40 , when @entity5 pictured himself writing books of varying degrees of madness , and not necessarily covering political campaigns of varying degrees of mad politicians			2
we do n't know how much of " @entity51 " he composed in the late ' 50s and how much he wrote later on ( the novel was n't actually published until 1998 ) , but i like to think that whatever was written by early - 20s @entity5 was written by a guy that already believed strongly in the notion that his own career momentum should take him down the path of madness , for better or worse			1
something that would be more awesome than meeting @entity5 and having him insult me and write me off like one of the debauched hack journalists in " @entity51 , " would be meeting him and having him love me			1
maybe he 'd like that i work at job where i get to post stuff like @entity164 and supercut video of people doing @entity5 impressions ? maybe @entity5 would even like @entity168 ? as @entity52 said earlier this week , " he was a very gentle guy			2
@entity169 , hypersensitive , hence the self - medication			0
" maybe i could get a cool @entity5 nickname like @entity52 , who @entity5 called " @entity172			2
" of course , if he liked me , we might end up dropping acid together and developing fuel - intake technology for the rock n ' roll backpack			0
and then there 's a good chance i 'd lose my mind .			0

" @entity51 " is supposed to be @entity5 finding his path to self destruction
