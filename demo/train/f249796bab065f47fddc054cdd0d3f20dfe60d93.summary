-- no one can question @entity3 's passion for @entity5 monster movies			1
the fanboy - friendly director , who earned his comic - con bona fides by crafting oddball fantasias including @entity9 and the @entity11 films , has spoken at length about being weaned on creature double features as a kid in @entity15			1
and it was n't just the granddaddy of all man - in - a - rubber - suit behemoths , @entity19 , who cracked open his mind			1
he also swooned over the more esoteric beasties in @entity25 ' kaiju ( i.e. , giant monster ) stable — titanic brutes like @entity28 , @entity29 , and @entity30			2
it goes without saying that the man 's geek credentials run deep			0
now , with his latest film , the gargantuan monsters - vs. - mammoth - robots smackdown @entity37 , @entity38 has somehow persuaded @entity39 to bankroll his tribute to the giddy junk food he grew up on			1
and that 's exactly what the film feels like : a 48 - year - old kid playing with gigantic action figures in the world 's most expensive sandbox			1
unfortunately , his deep - rooted passion never quite makes the leap from his imagination to the screen			1
@entity0 : @entity56 as @entity57 in trailer set in the not - too - distant future , @entity37 picks up after a string of apocalyptic sea - monster attacks have reduced @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64 to dust			1
it turns out that a breach in the bottom of the @entity68 has ripped open and loosed an armada of kaiju			0
humanity is defenseless against their massive , razor - toothed maws and battering - ram limbs — at least until the military 's high - tech @entity75 program is conceived			2
the @entity78 ( @entity79 for '' hunters '' ) are 25 - story robots operated by two human pilots whose minds are neurally linked in a process called '' the drift			2
'' the @entity78 are only as good as their operators , who must be able to read each other 's thoughts and intuit each other 's next moves			0
go - it - alone rebels need not apply			2
but of course one does : @entity94 ( @entity96 's @entity95 ) , a hotshot pilot whose brother was killed in a kaiju rampage and who 's so wild and unpredictable he might as well have the name '' @entity102 '' stenciled on his helmet			0
it does n't help matters that @entity95 has to bark goofy lines like '' stay in the drift , the drift is silence ! '' @entity0 : @entity109 says farewell to @entity111 silly dialogue is not the most serious problem with del @entity3 's rock - ' em - sock - ' em monster mash			1
we 've come to expect a few groaners from our action spectaculars			0
but do the clichés need to be piled quite so high ? @entity94 is a loner who must learn to trust his new partner ( @entity121 's @entity120 ) and heed the lessons of his stern commander ( @entity56 )			0
few of the actors leave much of an impression			0
and the ones who do ( @entity128 and @entity129 as a shrill pair of wacky scientists ) are grating			0
let 's be clear , though : the main reason anyone wants to see a movie like @entity37 is to watch robots smack the snot out of monsters and vice versa			1
and that 's where @entity38 hits the biggest snag			0
the problem is a matter of scale			2
@entity9 cast such a spell partly due to the freaky details of a character like the @entity149			0
the giant eye in the palm of his hand was designed with such jeweler 's precision that it was seared into your dreams ( and nightmares ) after you walked out of the theater			0
here , @entity38 's monsters are so big , and shot in such unrelenting rainy darkness , that the audience never gets a chance to dissect and fetishize their monstrous anatomies and be swept away by their weirdness			0
and if you ca n't be transported by a humongous calamari leviathan with suction - cup limbs projectile - vomiting bioluminescent goo , that 's an issue			2
i do n't know if @entity38 felt overwhelmed by the pressure of making a megabudget @entity174 tentpole for the first time , but there is n't enough of his bewitching poetic touch in the film			0
in a sense , @entity37 winds up being not enough of a @entity3 movie			1
it 's more like a mash - up of @entity183 and the @entity185 pictures			2
which is a shame , because the idea is undeniably cool			0
but i 'd be surprised if a kid in @entity15 or anywhere else walked out of @entity37 with a burning desire to direct a tribute to it when he or she grows up			1
