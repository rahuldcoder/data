-- he is one of the greatest skiers of all time , the winner of every major prize on offer , but when @entity7 looks back on his legendary career he feels a pang of regret			1
" @entity18 " called it quits at the end of the 1998 season , aged 31 , having won three olympic gold medals , two world championship titles and 50 @entity17 races			1
his final victory in the slalom at the @entity21 in @entity22 of 1998 meant the @entity23 established a record , as yet unbroken , of being the only male skier to win at least one race per year for 11 straight seasons			2
@entity7 's farewell appearance in the @entity29 in @entity30 in 1998 ended in a rare failure but , after watching the next two as a frustrated spectator , he came to the conclusion he had stopped racing prematurely			2
" i was watching @entity37 2002 , @entity38 , and after @entity39 i said , ' oh , i stopped skiing too early , i was too young , i was 31 , ' " he told @entity0 's @entity36 series			1
" i may feel in good shape but now i 'm 46 and what i can do ? it 's too late			0
" it is debatable whether @entity7 might have added to his victories , but he can reflect on leaving an indelible mark on his sport -- earning the adulation of fans not just in his home country , but the world over			2
his flamboyant style on the slopes was matched by a reputation for fast living off piste , but @entity7 insists it was exaggerated			0
" no , no no -- only half is true ! all the time they invented it , just for the press ... for fun			0
to provoke me also ! " current @entity17 star @entity62 also believes @entity7 rather cleverly maintained the image , but remained a very serious competitor at heart			1
" i hear that he went to sleep really early , got up at 2 o'clock in the night , went out for an hour and then went to bed again ... he was playing a little bit with that , " the @entity67 skier told @entity0			2
the longevity of @entity7 's career is testament to his ability and the hard work he put in , scoring his first @entity17 victory in 1987 when he beat his great idol , @entity76 of @entity77			1
two gold medals at the 1988 @entity79 catapulted him to world stardom and he successfully defended his giant slalom crown in the 1992 @entity29 in @entity82			1
1995 was to prove @entity7 's best season on the @entity17 circuit , winning 11 races and claiming the famous @entity86 as overall champion			1
a combination of circumstances had prevented @entity7 from claiming a world championship title , but he put that right in 1996 with double gold			2
it remains the highlight of a career full of highlights for @entity7 , now the patron of an @entity23 @entity98 project which targets youngsters who will be looking to follow in his giant footsteps			1
" i think it was in @entity102 , my world championships , i won two gold in two days			0
it was amazing , also the weather , the climate -- everything was perfect , " he recalled			0
@entity7 returned home to a rapturous welcome			0
" i remember when i flew back to @entity23 , everybody expects @entity114 at @entity115 , but i fly back to @entity116 because it was full , many people , 20,000 people -- that was amazing			0
" @entity7 was famous for his daring charges in the deciding second runs of his races , often making up large deficits from the first leg to storm to victory			0
for his second gold in the giant slalom in @entity102 he made up 0.81 seconds on the first - leg leader to top the podium			0
fellow ski legend @entity128 told @entity0 that was typical of @entity7 's style			1
" the way he skied , he was so light even though he was a big guy , he was so light on the skis , smooth and he could pull it off -- even though if the first run was not that great , he could really do it on the second run , " the @entity130 said .			0

@entity7 won three olympic gold medals during his *glittering* skiing career
the @entity23 legend also claimed two world titles and 50 @entity17 wins
tells @entity0 his one regret was quitting too early in 1998
" @entity18 " remains a revered figure in @entity23 and around the world
