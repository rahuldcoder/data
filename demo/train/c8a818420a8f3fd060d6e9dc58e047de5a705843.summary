@entity0 -- a @entity4 @entity3 investigator has recommended changing the official manner of death for a soldier electrocuted while showering at his base in @entity9 from " accidental " to " negligent homicide , " according to an e-mail from the investigator obtained by @entity1			1
@entity13 , a 24 - year - old @entity14 , died in a shower at his base in @entity9 on january 2 , 2008			1
the investigator blames @entity17 , the largest @entity4 contractor in @entity9 , and two @entity17 supervisors for the incident , saying there is " credible information ... they failed to ensure that work was being done by qualified electricians and plumbers , and to inspect the work that was being conducted			1
" the e-mail , written late last year , says the investigation report was being reviewed by @entity31 headquarters for a legal opinion to determine probable cause before the case could be referred to the military court system or the @entity36 for possible action			0
no charges have been filed			2
sgt. @entity13 's manner of death has not officially been changed , @entity31 spokesman @entity39 told @entity1			1
" it may change , but not at this time , " he said , adding that the @entity42 would make that determination			0
@entity17 spokeswoman @entity44 told @entity1 the company " can not comment on the report by an unidentified @entity3 investigator because we have not seen the report			1
" " @entity17 's investigation has produced no evidence that @entity17 was responsible for sgt. @entity13 's death , " @entity44 said			2
" we have cooperated fully with all government agencies investigating this matter and will do so in the future			0
" @entity1 first reported the death of @entity13 , a highly decorated , 24 - year - old @entity14 , last spring			0
his january 2 , 2008 , death was just one of many fatalities now believed to be linked to shoddy electrical work at @entity4 bases managed by @entity4 contractors , according to @entity65 sources			1
the @entity65 's @entity66 last year gave @entity17 a " @entity71 " -- issued only when a contractor is found in " serious non-compliance " and just one step below the possibility of suspending or terminating a contract , @entity65 officials said			0
in @entity17 's case , it means the contractor 's inspections and efforts to ensure electrical safety for troops have been unacceptable and must be significantly improved , @entity65 sources told @entity1			2
the cid investigator 's e-mail says work orders to address problems resulted in " fixes [ that ] were only temporary and not done to ensure no future problems would arise			2
" the @entity65 and its contract agency have declined requests for an interview to answer questions about @entity13 's death or the other cases			0
just after @entity13 's electrocution , @entity65 officials estimated that about a dozen troops had been electrocuted in @entity9			2
but @entity65 officials now say at least 18 troops have been electrocuted since 2003 -- many due to faulty wiring and improper grounding			0
the number could be higher if deaths from @entity100 are included , said congressional sources			0
@entity17 's contract in @entity9 is vast and encompasses numerous responsibilities including the upkeep of @entity4 bases and providing basic services on the bases			1
the 18 electrocutions occurred in different places and under different circumstances			0
at least two lawsuits have been filed against @entity17 , including one by @entity13 's family , and investigators are trying to determine precisely what role , if any , @entity17 played in the circumstances that led to those deaths .			1
