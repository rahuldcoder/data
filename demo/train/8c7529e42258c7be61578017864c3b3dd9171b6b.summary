-- september 7 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity13 , @entity14 : well , there 's a new technology out that makes annoying noises to try to stop people from loitering			1
but is it targeting teens ? you 'll hear all about it in today 's edition of @entity0			1
you viewers who 've been with us since the beginning of the school year : we hope you had a good @entity29			1
to you viewers who are just joining us : welcome to a new year and a new year 's worth of news from @entity0			1
let 's go ahead and get started			1
first up : focus on the economy @entity40 president @entity39 : eight million @entity40 lost their jobs in this recession			1
and even though we 've had eight straight months of private sector job growth , the new jobs have n't been coming fast enough			1
now , here 's the honest truth , the plain truth : there 's no silver bullet ; there 's no quick fix to these problems			1
@entity53 : president @entity39 , spending part of the @entity29 weekend talking about jobs in @entity56 , @entity57			1
it 's part of a @entity60 plan to put a spotlight on the @entity40 economy			1
during yesterday 's speech , the president talked about transportation projects : rebuilding roads , building and maintaining railways , working on airport runways			1
he says that all of that would help create jobs and help the country 's economy			1
now creating jobs , definitely a big priority			1
the government just released the latest unemployment numbers last week			2
and unemployment is at 9.6 percent			2
that is up one - tenth of a percent from the previous month , and it 's been right around that same range since may			1
@entity83 would have to approve all of the president 's proposed transportation projects			1
and some analysts do n't think there 's any chance of that happening soon			1
a recent @entity0 poll shows almost 60 percent of @entity40 disapprove of how president @entity39 is handling the economy			2
forty percent give him a thumbs up			2
midterm elections @entity53 : @entity95 and the economy : probably going to be big factors in this year 's midterm elections			1
we are less than two months away from the big day , november 2nd			2
no one 's running for president , but there are a lot of congressional seats up for grabs			1
that includes every seat in the @entity40 @entity109 , all 435 of ' @entity110 , 37 of the 100 @entity112 seats , and 37 states will be electing governors , too			2
so , where do things stand ? in a new @entity118 , around 1,000 people were asked what 's called a " generic ballot " question			1
it does n't have names on it ; it just asks , " would you vote for a @entity126 or a @entity127 ? " 52 percent said they would vote for a @entity126			2
45 percent said they 'd vote for a @entity127			2
back to that point about the economy being a major concern			2
according to another @entity0 poll , 81 percent of @entity40 think the @entity40 economy is in poor shape			2
18 percent think that the economy is doing well			2
those opinions , probably gon na impact how some people vote			2
blowout preventer raised @entity53 : you see that thing coming out of the water ? it 's called a blowout preventer , and it 's supposed to shut down an oil or gas well if anything goes wrong			1
this one did n't ; it failed , and a lot of experts think that 's what led to the massive oil spill in the @entity154			1
officials who are investigating that spill want to examine the blowout preventer to find out why it failed			2
a new one is in place on top of the oil well			1
once it 's been tested and approved , authorities can drill the last few feet of a relief well that 's gon na seal up the original well for good			1
@entity166 @entity167 , @entity14 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an island nation that 's located in the @entity171			1
you 'll find me southeast of @entity174 , my biggest trading partner			2
i 'm home to about 4 million people , who are sometimes called @entity4			1
i 'm @entity4 , and my capital city is @entity178			1
@entity4 quake @entity53 : parts of @entity4 are trying to recover from a massive earthquake that hit over the weekend			1
a couple people had serious injuries			2
around 100 others had minor bumps and cuts			2
luckily , there were no immediate reports of any deaths			2
but there is a lot of damage , as you can see here			2
the government has gotten 5,000 claims for damaged properties			2
a lot of those are for houses			2
the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.1			2
it struck early saturday morning			2
there have been some pretty strong aftershocks since then , too			2
experts say those aftershocks could keep coming for a week			0
@entity206 @entity53 : over in the @entity209 nation of @entity5 , people are struggling through the strongest rain in 60 years			1
more than 40,000 @entity5 are at risk			1
what happens is the powerful rain storms cause landslides			0
dozens of @entity5 have been killed or hurt			1
in one spot , a landslide knocked some vehicles off the road , and when people nearby came to help , another one hit the exact same location			0
thousands of homes have been damaged			0
fields full of crops have been washed out			0
the country 's president declared a national emergency over the weekend			1
he also said monday would be a day of mourning			0
@entity230 @entity53 : in @entity6 , officials are working to get 33 men out of a mine they 've been trapped in for more than a month			0
these officials have a plan , a back - up plan , and a back - up , back - up plan			0
and they 're gon na run all three at the same time			0
you can see the miners in this video			0
they seem to be in good spirits			0
now , @entity243 is to drill straight down to the shelter these guys are in			0
that could take several months			0
@entity247 is to drill at an angle			0
that could take about half the time			0
@entity251 is to use an oil drill			0
that could be the fastest option , but it wo n't be ready until later this month			0
what 's the @entity257 ? @entity258 , @entity14 : what 's the @entity257 ? to hang around or stay in one place for no apparent reason @entity262 that 's the word ! @entity264 @entity53 : so , loitering might not seem like a big deal			1
we 've all probably spent time hanging out at the mall			0
store owners might see loitering differently			0
if you 're loitering , more often than not , you 're not shopping			0
and in some cases , loiterers can drive away business			0
one mall is trying a sonic solution to drive away loiterers			0
but as @entity278 tells us , some people are sounding off in opposition			0
( begin video ) @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 : it can cause a high - pitched headache , and that 's by design			1
just outside the @entity291 subway stop in @entity284 , the @entity289 beeps often			1
but is it indiscriminate ? this anti-loitering device was placed here after a big street brawl , but the property managers and the @entity289 's distributor both tell @entity0 the noisemaker does n't target young people			1
still , the distributor says teenagers happen to do the most loitering , and he says the sound is most effective for the stage of life when humans can hear the highest pitches			1
@entity308 , moving sound technologies : the @entity289 , when activated , emits a sound at 17.5 kilohertz , which is at the high end of the youth hearing range , 13 to 25 - year - old hearing range			0
when a youth hears the sound , they find it extremely annoying and will leave the area in a few minutes			0
@entity318 : at @entity291 , we saw some young people getting irritated			0
@entity321 : can you hear it ? @entity324 : probably would n't shop at any of these shops if i heard it again			1
@entity318 : why not ? @entity324 : it 's too annoying			1
it gave me a headache			0
@entity318 : there are settings on the @entity289 that can be heard by older age groups			0
i played the sound off a computer in our newsroom near several people in their 20s , 30s and older			0
i did n't tip them off beforehand			0
on settings for people 25 , 30 , 35 and younger , no one reacted			0
then ... we 're going to play a setting now for people 50 years old and under			0
@entity321 : oh , i heard that			0
@entity321 : i hear that			1
@entity318 : i can hear that , too			1
still , some believe this device does target teenagers unfairly			0
among the community leaders who have concerns about this device , @entity357 of the @entity358 here in the @entity291 area			0
@entity357 , if there are problems with violence and loiterers driving away customers from businesses that count on that business in this area , would n't anything like this help ? @entity370 , @entity371 : i 'm sympathetic to businesses needing to be able to engage the most customers in the best possible way			0
i 'm sympathetic to that			0
this is n't the best solution			0
we need to have better programs for youth ; we need to engage them in activities			0
( @entity383 ) before we go @entity53 : finally today , before we go , ever seen a black widow take down a buffalo ? that 's what happened this weekend in @entity388 , @entity389			1
all right , so we 're talking about buffalo wings , not a full bison			0
but these guys -- and gal -- can pack ' em away			0
in fact , @entity395 -- she 's known as the @entity395 -- ate 181chicken wings in 12 minutes			1
that 's enough to take home the title and beat her own world record			1
goodbye @entity53 : we actually did n't plan any puns for this story , so i guess i 'm just gon na have to wing it			0
she buffalo 'd the competition ? she obviously had a wing - ing strategy			0
that whole event looks like a three wing circus ! maybe we 'll just chew over the possibilities			0
either way , we 'll be back tomorrow			0
hope you will too ! for @entity0 , i 'm @entity35 .			0
