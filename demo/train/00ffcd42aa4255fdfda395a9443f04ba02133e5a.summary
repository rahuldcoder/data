-- this time of year , i am disturbed at the number of curveballs we see being thrown during the @entity5			1
i coached youth baseball for eight years , each spring and fall			1
three years ago , i wrote that @entity7 should ban the use of the curveball by its young pitchers			1
the evidence seemed clear -- and sports injury doctors seemed to all agree -- that pitchers who were 13 and younger were not physically capable of handling the torque and strain on the elbow when throwing a curveball			1
the ulnar collateral ligaments connecting the lower and upper part of an arm simply could n't survive the strain , they said			0
now , there is evidence the curveball may not be entirely to blame			1
but there is still debate over whether it should be allowed at such a young age			1
@entity5 and others did separate studies -- and got somewhat similar results showing that injuries can result not just from throwing curveballs , but from kids throwing too much , with too little rest between pitching appearances			1
@entity5 instituted strict pitch - count and innings - pitched rules five years ago			1
but those rules do n't apply to @entity41 - sanctioned games			0
" the difference now is , kids are playing on a number of travel and showcase teams outside @entity5 , and they have no such rules , " says @entity42 , vice president of communications for @entity7			1
" travel ball has no rules on pitch count or number of innings pitched			0
so you now have kids throwing 300 to 400 pitches over a four - day period , " he says			2
doctor : ' do n't throw curveballs until you can shave ' @entity7 commissioned its study with @entity62 and the @entity63			2
more than 1,300 pitchers of all ages were examined			2
for the @entity5 age group , 409 pitchers were analyzed , looking for which factors influenced injury risk			1
" what was causing arm problems was not the curve ball , but the overuse of the arm			2
it found no evidence to say breaking pitches caused no more injuries than any others , " says @entity42			1
meanwhile , a group of doctors including dr. @entity83 , the country 's leading doctor in sports arm surgeries , conducted their own study			2
@entity83 specializes in " @entity88 " surgery , which reconstructs the ulnar collateral ligament and is named after a former @entity92 pitcher			0
@entity83 and his team at the @entity94 did their study in a laboratory , not on a field			0
and they found throwing a curveball enacts no more force on the arm than a fastball			0
but , they say , throwing curveballs early can lead you down a dangerous path later in a baseball career			1
" dr. @entity83 still insists , ' do n't throw curveballs until you can shave , " @entity108 , executive director of @entity94 told @entity0			2
and , he acknowledges , " that was a controlled lab setting			0
the field of play during a game is n't like that			2
" " we 've tracked @entity5 games right through the @entity5 , and as the competition grows , the kids throw curveballs up to 70 % of the time , " @entity117 , @entity94 's director of research and co-author of the @entity83 study , told @entity121			1
" it 's good that @entity7 have enacted rules on pitch counts , but for say , a kid in the @entity136 ( @entity135 ) , if you see an unusually developed curveball at an early age , who knows the mileage on that arm ? " @entity108 says , " the kid who throws all those curve balls in the @entity5 is a hero			1
but does he ever get a change to earn a college scholarship or sign a major league contract ? do you want to take a chance on your son or daughter to get a college scholarship ? do you want to be a hero at 13 or 14 but never much else after that ? " surgery on the rise for young players ? even though @entity5 has instituted new pitch count rules , @entity94 says @entity83 has performed about seven times the number of arm operations on young pitchers that he did 15 years ago			1
so why not err on the side of caution and take @entity83 ' advice ? " ( @entity83 ) himself will say that is an opinion of his , and is not based on any empirical data , " @entity42 says			0
" there was n't any evidence in this study			2
it 's a fine distinction between the two			0
" " @entity5 has always been the leader in sports safety			1
we make changes in our sport based on data , not on feelings			0
we act out of scientific evidence , " he says			2
however , @entity83 ' office does agree that kids who pitched while fatigued are 36 times more likely to have serious arm problems			2
some 2.6 million kids play @entity5 baseball all over the world			1
parents often are sizing up the competition for their 10 - to 13 - year - olds for future high school teams and college scholarships , and believe their kids should play as much as possible to improve their chances			1
@entity5 officials admit too much baseball is not healthy			1
" kids play year - round now , " @entity42 says			1
" kids should n't be playing year - round in anything			2
if a parent is making a 10 - year - old do that ... it will make them hate the game by the time they are 16 or 17 years old			0
" @entity83 ' group is n't alone on its curveball stance			0
dr. @entity203 , director of the @entity204 at @entity205 , told the @entity206 in april that he still believes the curveball is best not thrown until a pitcher is at least 14			2
he also said kids should n't attempt to throw a slider , a pitch that puts even more stress on the elbow , until 16			0
@entity214 , an @entity215 - based pitching instructor and former scout for the @entity217 and the @entity218 , gave my son the same guidance in years of lessons			0
my son went on to pitch for @entity224 @entity223			0
dr. @entity225 , an @entity226 orthopedic surgeon who is the @entity227 ' physician , told the @entity228 this spring he performs 150 elbow ligament reconstructions a year			0
" seventy percent of those surgeries are pitchers who have n't hit college yet , " @entity225 said			0
" i ask each one the same question : when did you start throwing curveballs ? and they say : ' i was 10			0
' sometimes , it 's 9			0
" five years ago , i attended a coaches ' clinic at @entity240 that included the coaches and trainers of @entity240 and the @entity217			0
at the time , @entity240 had a team that counted and documented every pitch of the televised @entity5			1
team members noted an increase in the use of the curveball every season			0
@entity83 appeared in a video message , and all at the clinic agreed no one under 14 should be throwing the curveball			0
if you are watching the @entity5 as a baseball purist , that sweeping hook of the curve can be a thing of beauty			1
but take a good look at the kids throwing them now			0
chances are , you may not see them throw it or any other pitches without major surgery needed before they reach high school			0
so i will ask @entity5 again : why not ban the curveball ?			1

evidence *suggests* that curveballs may not be entirely to blame for injuries
@entity5 has taken steps to *prevent* overuse of pitchers ' arms
some doctors say curveballs should not be thrown by young pitchers
some 2.6 million kids worldwide play @entity5 baseball
