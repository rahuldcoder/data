@entity1 , @entity0 -- if you want to peer inside your dna , there 's no shortage of companies offering avenues for doing so these days			2
a cheek swab or saliva sample is all firms need to scan your genes			2
but how much health - relevant information can they provide ? the opportunity to have your complete genome mapped was recently auctioned on @entity19 -- with the winning bidder shelling out a cool $ 68,000 in the auction , which ended monday			1
however , more cost - conscious consumers are more likely to send in a saliva sample to a company like @entity26 - backed @entity25 , which will scan and analyze genetic information for about $ 400			1
the costs and services these firms offer vary widely , but they 're basically chasing the same market : the customer who is curious about what their genes can tell them about themselves			1
welcome to the world of personal genomics			2
a spate of firms -- from @entity25 and fellow @entity42 start - up @entity43 to @entity45 , @entity46 - based @entity39 and @entity48 's @entity47 -- are vying to tap the growing interest in dna analysis among individuals			1
they 're upbeat about the promise of this business , saying that consumers ' ability to gauge how their genes influence risk for diseases like diabetes and cancer could revolutionize health care			2
" the ability to treat disease is driven by the ability to assess risk			0
as knowledge builds up , it will increasingly become an unacceptable position not to have your genetic profile , " says @entity66 , chief executive of @entity47 , one of the first firms to offer scans that allow individuals to examine their genomes			1
but analysts and researchers are a bit more cautious			2
while there 's plenty of potential for retail genomics , they say the budding market is still in its early stages			1
have you bought a retail dna test ? share your story on @entity88 companies that offer personal dna analysis have attracted the interest of individuals who are highly concerned with their health , as well as so - called early adopters who are enamored with new technologies			1
but the outlook for business opportunities is still hazy , mostly because there is n't a full understanding of the benefit of these tests in terms of identifying how and why diseases occur in people , according to @entity105 , a health care analyst at consulting firm @entity107			1
. just how much health - relevant information consumers can glean remains hotly debated in the research community			1
studies suggest that common maladies like heart disease and diabetes may result from the variations of several genes , rather than the single variants that many retail gene tests scan for			2
@entity120 , head of the @entity121 at @entity122 , believes that given the current knowledge of how genes influence disease , there is only a " recreational " use for retail tests			0
like many other researchers , he believes the odds identified by these tests can be so marginal that they have a weak effect on health when compared to lifestyle or environmental factors			1
if someone wants to lower their risk for diabetes , for instance , they 're better off exercising more and changing their diet than getting a retail gene test , @entity120 told @entity2			0
consumer genomics firms agree there is still much to be discovered , but they say providing consumers with the knowledge that is available to them is better than none at all			1
" it is an evolving science			0
to ignore the genetic markers that we currently understand would be complacency , " says @entity153 , chief medical officer at @entity43 , which is backed by venture capital heavyweights @entity155 and @entity156			0
@entity160 , co-founder of @entity25 , says arming people with information may help them turn their attention to prevention			1
" we think making this data available to people will help people focus their behavior and lifestyle			0
" companies are adjusting their services as new research becomes available , says @entity173 , a @entity175 - based genetics researcher who follows the consumer genomics market on his blog , @entity179			1
" right now , the genome scans offered by companies like @entity25 focus on common genetic variants , and do n't pick up most rare variants like @entity185 's disease mutations , " he said			2
however , several companies are now beginning to add these rare , severe disease mutations into their tests , @entity173 said			0
the market may also get a boost as costs for complete genome sequencing continue to drop			0
privately funded @entity39 currently charges $ 99,500 to map a complete genome			0
but many scientists foresee complete sequencing eventually falling to just $ 1,000			0
as it becomes more cost effective to conduct larger research studies , they anticipate discovering more medically relevant information			1
being able to identify ahead of time whether you 're at risk of disease is something that can be beneficial going forward , " says @entity200 , an analyst at investment research firm @entity201			0
he expects sales of services for testing genetic make - up to hit $ 1 billion in three years			0
" as the technology gets better , this potentially could be something more people get into , " he said			0
although @entity200 , who covers @entity47 , one of the few firms in the space that 's publicly listed , said the outlook for the @entity48 firm was bleak			1
@entity47 has been hit by the credit crisis , fueling chatter it 's headed for bankruptcy			2
however @entity66 dismissed that speculation and told @entity2 the company expects to complete its restructuring by the end of may			0
it 's too early to say whether consumer genomics is going mainstream , @entity25 's @entity225 says			1
but there 's no denying there 's tremendous interest among consumers			0
" it goes [ back ] to human nature			0
we 're very curious about ourselves			0

*handful* of firms from @entity25 to @entity47 offer dna tests to individuals
but how much health - relevant information can be gleaned is hotly debated
consumer genomics market in early stages , but has potential , analysts say
