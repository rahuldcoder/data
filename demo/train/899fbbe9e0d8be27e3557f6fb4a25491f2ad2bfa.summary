-- here 's a real shocker : teens are better than their parents at using the @entity4 , and are likely to hide some of their online behaviors from them			1
that news comes from a 2,017 - person survey funded by the online security software maker @entity10 , which is pushing a product that helps parents monitor their kids online			1
seventy percent of teens " hide their online behavior " from parents , according to the report , which was released monday			1
that 's up from 45 % in 2010 , the group says			1
these hidden behaviors include some things you might expect -- such as accessing violent ( 43 % ) or pornographic ( 32 % ) content online -- but also a few surprises			2
fifteen percent of teens have hacked into social networks ; 9 % have hacked into e-mail accounts ; 12 % have met face to face with a person he or she met on the @entity4 ; and 16 % of teens surveyed said they had used their phones to cheat on tests at school			2
@entity10 said parents are often unaware of these behaviors			1
@entity38 quietly unveils ' stalking app ' " parents , you must stay in - the - know , " @entity10 's @entity40 wrote in a blog post			1
" since your teens have grown up in an online world , they may be more online savvy than their parents , but you ca n't give up			1
you must challenge yourselves to become familiar with the complexities of the teen online universe and stay educated on the various devices your teens are using to go online			2
" as a parent of two young girls , i proactively participate in their online activities and talk to them about the ' rules of the road ' for the @entity4			0
i 'm hoping that this report opens the eyes of parents to become more involved and also consider using technology such as @entity62 to protect their kids online			1
" there 's the product pitch			0
@entity62 , like similar products from other security companies , lets parents spy on their kids ' online behaviors and block certain websites			2
according to an online description of the product , @entity62 lets parents log the social - media posts and instant message conversations of their children			2
[ update : the pitch for @entity80 has since been removed from the blog post			0
] nearly half of parents install some sort of online controls , the survey said			2
forty - four percent know their teens ' passwords , and one in 10 uses a location - monitoring device			0
not everyone advocates that approach to teen online security , however			1
" we do n't think it 's a good idea for parents to spy on their kids surreptitiously , because eventually they 're going to find something they have to confront them about , and it 's going to destroy the other lines of communication , " @entity94 , a criminal justice professor and co-director of the @entity96 , told @entity0 in 2010			2
in the report , @entity10 also encourages parents to be upfront with their children if they decide to monitor their behaviors			1
" half of teens say they would think twice about their online activities if they knew parents were watching , " the report said			1
the @entity10 - funded report , which was carried out by the research company @entity113 , surveyed 1,013 parents and 1,004 teens between the ages of 13 and 17			1
