-- a team of scientists has agreed that a giant asteroid killed off dinosaurs and a majority of other species on @entity7 more than 65 million years ago			1
the researchers analyzed evidence and agreed that it supports a single - impact theory first proposed 30 years ago on the cause of the mass extinction			1
since 1980 , scientists have gathered an overwhelming amount of evidence that shows a single asteroid about 6 miles in diameter , traveling at around 43,000 mph , slammed into the @entity19 , said @entity20 , a paleoceanographer at the @entity21			1
the impact caused a crater 24 miles deep and 125 miles wide , according to @entity20 , who was part of the research team			1
the crater was discovered in 1991 in @entity26 , @entity27 , on the @entity28 , said scientists who called it the " smoking gun " that backed up the asteroid theory			2
@entity20 compared the asteroid 's impact with a blast from 100 million megatons of @entity36			2
" it 's basically more powerful than all the atomic weapons on the planet going off all at once , " he said			1
the researchers wanted to settle disputes about what killed off the dinosaurs			0
some theories have argued that it would have taken many meteorites to cause such a cataclysmic event			1
another rival theory suggested that the mass extinction was a result of a massive volcanic eruption in @entity52 that took place around the same time as the impact			0
however , evidence now shows that one monster impact caused the ecological catastrophe , @entity20 said			0
data at the crater 's location showed rock with concentrations of iridium and platinum , which are characteristic of the chemical fingerprints of the asteroid , @entity20 said			0
@entity20 speculates it took about 15 million years before the planet and surviving species started recovering from the impact that also destroyed 70 percent of other species			1
" it 's believed that the impact actually blew down the forests over most of @entity74 from the pressure wave associated with the explosion , " @entity20 said			0
" then there was this fireball that came after that that fried a lot of vegetation and basically cleaned off the landscape over most of @entity74			0
" scientists say the impact also caused a huge earthquake			2
it " jiggled loose a lot of sediment on the eastern seaboard , " @entity20 said			0
the conclusion was published in the journal @entity92 on friday .			0

scientists say a single asteroid about 6 miles in diameter slammed into the @entity19
impact was " more powerful than all the atomic weapons on the planet going off all at once "
took planet millions of years to recover from cataclysmic event
