-- @entity1 would welcome back @entity2 to help turn around the famous @entity6 team 's flagging fortunes			1
as @entity1 's former technical director , @entity2 helped guide the @entity1 to six constructors ' titles as well as five world titles between 2000 and 2004 with @entity11			1
@entity1 's new team principal @entity12 revealed to @entity0 he would be happy to work with the @entity14 technical guru			1
" @entity2 is an iconic figure at [ @entity1 headquarters ] @entity16 , " @entity12 told @entity0			1
" everyone would like to have @entity2 or would like to see @entity2 back at @entity1			1
" he 's one of the most respected personalities in @entity6 with the highest knowledge and pedigree			0
everybody would be happy with someone like @entity2			0
" @entity2 left his latest role as team principal of @entity25 in 2013 after taking the @entity26 to the verge of their most successful season in the sport since the 1950s			1
the @entity32 team is leading this season 's team and driver championships with @entity36 acknowledged as a huge driving force behind the success			2
in contrast , @entity1 has not won the team title since 2008 while current driver @entity41 was the last to win the drivers ' crown in 2007			2
@entity44 continues to drive for the team , finishing on the podium twice this season , while @entity41 has struggled to adapt to the feel of the car under 2014 's huge rule changes			0
@entity1 would love to emulate @entity25 ' sensational return to form , perhaps with @entity36 's help			1
" we 've talked several times , " said the @entity1 team principal , who took over the role following @entity57 's resignation in april			1
" @entity2 has been at @entity1			1
he came here with friends so it was very nice to spend a few minutes [ together ]			0
" @entity36 is on a break from @entity6 after leaving @entity25 following a management restructure which saw former @entity65 technical director @entity64 arrive to lead the team alongside @entity67			1
however , @entity12 made it clear that any future for @entity36 with @entity1 would not undermine his tenure at the top			1
successful story " at the moment i am the number one on the team , " the @entity73 insisted			0
" i like to work with what i have			0
we are building a very strong team with a medium , long - term plan			0
" my role is to shorten as much as i can this plan to make it effective as soon as possible			0
we are building the foundation for a very successful story			0
" certainly , @entity12 is a man who has created his own story of success up to this point , following a 15 - year career with the @entity73 marque			2
roles in @entity92 and @entity93 led to the 43 - year - old becoming president of the @entity97 business , where he picked up the ' @entity98 ' following a 20 % increase in sales			0
so global were his previous roles that he 's currently readjusting to life back in @entity73 for the first time in 20 years , while his young family remain in the @entity105			0
critics argue @entity12 lacks @entity6 experience , but for the man who lives by a personal motto of ' nothing is impossible ' , this is the time for the ' @entity112 ' to be bullish			2
and key to rediscovering their ' self confidence ' will be not to repeat the mistakes of the recent past			0
@entity1 failed to take advantage of 2014 's new engine formula , which opened the door to catch up on its rivals , and engine chief @entity122 subsequently found himself without a job			0
the @entity1 reportedly made another big money offer to @entity126 's star technical chief @entity125 this year , although he turned it down to stay on at @entity126 in a revised role			2
a much needed reorganization of @entity1 's technical department continues to be led by @entity130 , who returned to the @entity73 team in 2013 from the @entity131			1
when asked if he was confident he might be able to tempt @entity36 to also return to @entity1 , @entity12 responded : " as i said , at the moment i 'm building a new team			1
" @entity130 is the technical director and i want to start from this point			2
" to tango you have to have two , " the classical music fan told @entity0			0
" maybe @entity2 is happy with what he is doing			0
" @entity2 , who turned to his hobby of fly - fishing after leaving @entity1 in 2006 , might not be fishing for a return to @entity6 or @entity1 yet			1
but if @entity12 could persuade him to join the @entity73 marque he would have landed one of the sport 's biggest catches .			2

@entity1 team principal says @entity2 is " an iconic figure " at the @entity73 @entity6 team
@entity12 adds everyone would like to see the former technical director back at @entity1
@entity36 is on a break from @entity6 after leaving @entity25 at the end of 2014
@entity12 adds any potential return for @entity36 would not impinge on his own role
