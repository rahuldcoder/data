@entity3 , take a breather			2
tuesday night 's premiere of " @entity7 , " which drew ecstatic reactions on social media , is just the latest example of more action series and films featuring women			1
in years past , we had shows such as " @entity16 , " " @entity17 : warrior princess " and " @entity19 , " but lately it seems like female action heroes are popping up more than ever			1
between " @entity31 's " @entity23 , @entity25 's roles as @entity26 and " @entity27 " ( and soon to come , " @entity32 " ) and upcoming movies based on " @entity29 " and " @entity30 , " it has been a great time to see women have a chance to kick butt and take names			1
" @entity7 " is a special example , a spinoff of " captain america : the @entity40 " following the continuing adventures of @entity3 's @entity43 girlfriend after the war was over and she believed him to be dead			1
@entity46 runs up against sexism in her office , where she 's relegated to fetching coffee and answering phones , but she goes on her own rogue action - packed missions , uncovering perhaps more than she bargained for			1
" she 's capable and strong , but what we have n't seen are the emotional and psychological consequences of losing the love of her life , of living in a male - dominated environment , of being a triple spy and making sure that people around her do n't know who she really is , " star @entity52 said			2
" that creates feelings of isolation in her			2
" @entity52 commented on where a lot of the strides for women in action roles have come from			1
" it feels like we have great roles in @entity26 and @entity74 , and @entity30 is leading the way for more female characters , " she said			1
" the fans want to see it , and they 're exceeding their expectations			0
" just like everything with @entity30 , it can all be traced back to the comic books			1
2014 was a banner year for female characters , with new series for the aforementioned " @entity30 , " as well as " @entity85 , " " @entity86 " and " @entity87 : @entity88			1
" perhaps most significantly , the mighty @entity89 is now a woman			1
not to be outdone , @entity91 ( owned by @entity92 , as is @entity1 ) revamped @entity93 and launched a new " @entity97 " series featuring @entity29 , and a " @entity96 " series			1
" this is a ground - up phenomenon , " explained " @entity86 " writer @entity98			0
" this began with the fans			0
part of it is because there 's gender parity of who goes to ( comic book ) conventions			1
it used to be overwhelmingly male			0
now at @entity112 for example , it 's 50/50 men and women			2
as you bring in more female readers into the medium , they 're going to want to spend their money on stories they think are worth reading			0
" " five or six years ago , we probably had one female - led series on the stands , " pointed out @entity30 editor @entity123 , who has made it her mission to make comics for women and other underserved demographics			1
" when we came back with ' @entity30 ' a few years ago , the response was almost cult - like from the reactions we 've had from fans			1
the way we revamped the character resonated with a lot of the audience , especially female readers			0
" and @entity30 is no stranger to pushing past the norm in comics			1
" @entity30 had ' x-men 's ' storm -- at that time , you would be hard - pressed to find a woman of color in a position of leadership , " @entity98 noted			1
" now there 's much more freedom to tell authentic experiences that women readers will recognize			2
" " @entity30 " writer @entity153 writes stories about women she recognizes as well , whether they have superpowers or not			1
" @entity161 ( @entity162 ) is a woman who is very aware of her flaws , " @entity153 said of the captain 's popularity ( the fanbase is called the " @entity160 " )			2
" she 's not perfect			0
she does n't pretend to be			0
she 's always trying to do a little better			0
she attracts people who have that same quality			0
yes , @entity161 is short - tempered and can be very self - centered			0
but there are others who do the same			0
" giving female characters flaws in comic books was tough in years past , according to " @entity87 " writer @entity170			1
" there was an undercurrent of pressure to make ( every lead female character ) a role model , " she said			0
" so often , you saw female characters written poorly			0
but if you write a character who always makes the right decision , it becomes very tedious very quickly			0
it 's great to have a character who can really screw up and make terrible choices			0
" @entity186 has been very sensitive about how women are written in comics			2
" the one way you can get women to read comics is to not talk down to them and to see representations of women that are strong and beautiful at the same time without being overly sexualized , " she said			2
" they want to see themselves as sexy and beautiful , but they do n't want to be exploited			0
" and characters such as agent @entity7 show how things have changed in portraying heroic women			1
" there 's nothing inherently masculine about heroism , " said @entity153			0
" female heroism has been underplayed because it does n't serve the default narrative			0
there 's nothing inherently masculine about telling stories with pictures , or wish fulfillment or even power fantasies			0
i 'm a 5 - foot woman who 's always looked like a child ; i can teach any man in any room about power fantasies			2
" who better to discuss the importance of heroic female characters than one of the first ? before @entity29 ( and certainly before @entity30 or agent @entity7 ) , there was @entity93 , as portrayed by @entity226 on the " @entity228 " tv series in 1967 and ' 68			1
" women would see me at conventions and say ' when i was a little girl , i saw that girls could kick butt just as well as guys if they wanted to , and it was that character that made that apparent to me , ' " @entity229 said			2
" men would say , ' i married my wife because of that character ; she showed me women could be so much more than we were conditioned to believe in those days			2
' " nearly 50 years after @entity229 's @entity93 , we 're seeing how female heroes can inspire people in a much bigger way .			0
