-- african - american poet @entity1 once wrote : " @entity2 is a historical truth ... no man can know where he 's going unless he knows exactly where he 's been and exactly how he arrived at his present place			1
" this search for " historical truth " has led thousands of visitors to @entity11 , in @entity12 , a picturesque seaside town with stunning blue sea , serene beaches and pastel - colored fishing boats			1
instead of idyllic days under the sun , they are looking for a glimpse into their dark ancestral past -- the harrowing experience of their @entity23 forebears who were sold as slaves			1
roots tourism has brought more and more people of @entity23 descent , like @entity30 and @entity31 , to the sleepy fishing port			1
@entity33 , @entity31 and their tour group from @entity36 walk the grounds of @entity38 , a seaside fortress that served as slave dungeons , to see what their ancestors went through before they were shipped across the @entity44			1
" i 'm slightly numb actually , " said @entity31			2
" i was n't actually ready for the stories about this place as far as the way people were treated , and the thing about the tunnel and everyone bound and being led down the tunnel is a little bit tragic , a little bit too much to take in all at once			2
" his fellow traveler agreed			0
" it is a little devastating at first , " said @entity33			0
" it 's good to know the history of what has happened and how to connect your historical past with things that have happened			0

it was an emotional pilgrimage for them , especially because first lady @entity70 and her mother are descendants of slaves from @entity74			0
crumbling colonial buildings are a reminder that @entity11 was once @entity77 colonial capital that changed hands between the @entity79 , the @entity80 , the @entity81 , the @entity82 and the @entity83 through centuries			1
the largest slave trade outpost it flourished as the largest slave - trading outpost in @entity2 when the opening of @entity77 plantations in the @entity90 in the 1500s drove the demand for slaves , eclipsing the gold trade			2
for more than three centuries , millions of captured @entity23 -- men , women and children -- arrived from different parts of the continent and were herded like cattle onto ships destined to the @entity65 , @entity102 and the @entity103			1
@entity104 , a senior educator at @entity38 who gave @entity64 and his family a guided tour , describes the inhumane conditions the slaves had to endure in the fortress			1
they were crammed into a small space , living on little food , water and air , even defecating side by side , often for months			0
female captives were subjected to rape and sexual abuse by guards and officials			0
those who survived the harrowing conditions had to go through the so - called " @entity121 " -- an arched gateway with a pair of thick doors that would shut behind the captured men , women and children before they were forced onto the slave ships			2
" for many , this door represents ... a journey from the known to the unknown , " says @entity104			0
" and therefore right from here , their resistance was much anticipated			0
" while many travelers use @entity11 as a base to explore @entity12 's other tourist spots , like @entity138 , the city hopes roots tourism , with the castle as a focus , could bring in more visitors to spend longer time there			1
and perhaps the dark chapter of history tells not only a story of misery but also that of survival			0
asked how @entity64 reacted during the visit , @entity104 says the president was " surprised , shocked and sad -- and also motivated ... because if blacks survived through this , then it is a survival of human beings			1
it shows that we have a high survival instinct			0
