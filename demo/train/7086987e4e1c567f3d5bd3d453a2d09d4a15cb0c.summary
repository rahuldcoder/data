@entity0 -- the @entity2 ruled monday that two men convicted of killings committed when they were 14 can not be sentenced to life in prison without at least the possibility of parole			1
the 5 - 4 ruling is a victory for defenders of juvenile offenders , affirming recent high court rulings against harsh criminal sentences			1
justice @entity15 said it would be wrong for states to ignore the chance that these now - adult inmates may someday be rehabilitated			1
" the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality , and so violate the @entity25 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment , " @entity15 said			1
justices mull whether life without parole appropriate for underage killers the high court in 2005 banned the death penalty for those under 18 who commit aggravated murder			1
then , five years later , the justices said juveniles found guilty of non-homicides could not receive life without parole			1
the spotlight has now turned on the youngest of killers and the question of whether a national consensus has developed to treat them differently regarding a lifetime of incarceration			2
the separate appeals involved an @entity48 boy who , with an accomplice , robbed a neighbor and then beat the man to death and set his house on fire ; and an @entity56 youth who was part of a group of teens who robbed a video store where the clerk was blasted to death with a shotgun			2
both defendants are now adults serving their sentences			2
both were tried and convicted as adults and received the minimum sentences allowed under state law for felony capital murder			0
about 2,500 prisoners are serving life sentences without parole for crimes committed as juveniles , at least 79 of whom were 14 years or younger at the time , according to the @entity77 , which is representing the two men before the high court			1
in his argument to the court , attorney @entity80 had urged the justices not to " give up " on child offenders , who he said are fundamentally different from adults			2
he said that while they must be held accountable for their actions , youths are also works in progress , emotionally and developmentally			0
@entity80 said firmly that all those under 18 at the time of their crimes deserve the chance for parole someday			1
he said the often - terrible facts of a murder can overwhelm any mitigating factors like a defendant 's age , especially for jurors who may be unaware that a young person 's brain and self - control are often not fully developed , and their living environment can play a role as well			0
" you would say that a person of 17 years and 11 months who commits the worst possible string of offenses -- and demonstrates great maturity -- still can not be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole ? " asked @entity106 during oral arguments in march			1
he wrote the tough dissenting opinion , supported by chief justice @entity116 , and justices @entity117 and @entity119			0
" when the majority of this court countermands that democratic decision ( by state legislatures ) , what the majority is saying is that members of society must be exposed to the risk that these convicted murders , if released from custody , will murder again , " said @entity106 , who delivered his dissent from the bench , a rare privilege typically granted in only the most contentious of cases			1
@entity48 solicitor general @entity135 told the court that states deserve discretion to set punishments for the worst of offenders , even teenagers			2
complicating matters , several justices at argument noted differences between the two cases before them			0
@entity135 said the murder committed by @entity149 in @entity48 was especially " gruesome			0
" the boy and his accomplice had smoked marijuana with the victim in his trailer			0
the 52 - year - old man burned to death after the mobile home was set ablaze			0
in @entity159 's case , he was outside acting as a lookout when the @entity162 , @entity56 , robbery took place			0
it was a 15 - year - old boy who shot the female clerk when she refused to turn over money			0
the actual shooter later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole			1
@entity80 said there was a real question whether @entity159 had an " intent to kill " during the botched robbery , perhaps allowing for a lesser sentence			0
but @entity56 assistant attorney general @entity177 said the sentence of life without parole was still appropriate , arguing the defendant could have received the death penalty if he had been an adult at the time of the crime			1
" a legislative judgment has been made with regard to drawing a baseline for all murderers , whether they are juvenile murderers , whether they are getaway drivers , " @entity177 said			0
" and when you counsel or aid or do anything that gets you liability for being a capital murderer , then that is the minimum sentence " -- life without parole , with no exceptions			2
the cases are @entity149 v. @entity48 ( 10 - 9646 ) and @entity159 v. @entity202 ( 10 - 9647 )			0
from the archives : opinion column argues against life without parole for juveniles			2

two men sentenced to life must have at least the chance of parole , the court says
each of them was 14 years old at the time of the crimes
@entity15 : " the mandatory sentencing schemes *...* violate ( the ) principle of proportionality ,
@entity106 : the ruling exposes society to the risk of the men murdering again if released
