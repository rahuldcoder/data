@entity0 -- president @entity2 announced monday that he has signed an executive order allowing new sanctions against companies that enable @entity6 and @entity7 to use technology such as cell phone monitoring to carry out human rights abuses			1
the order is part of a broader strategy intended to strengthen the administration 's ability to prevent atrocities , including creation of an @entity18 , @entity2 said in somber remarks at the @entity20 to mark @entity21			1
" these technologies should be in place to empower citizens , not to repress them , " @entity2 said of the measure , which targets the @entity6 and @entity7 governments , as well as companies that provide them with high - tech equipment to use against their own people			1
a @entity32 statement said the executive order signed sunday " authorizes sanctions and visa bans against those who commit or facilitate grave human rights abuses via information technology ... related to @entity6 and @entity7 regime brutality			1
" " this novel sanctions tool allows us to sanction not just those oppressive governments , but the companies that enable them with technology they use for oppression and the ' digital guns for hire ' who create or operate systems used to monitor , track , and target citizens for killing , torture , or other grave abuses , " the @entity32 statement said			1
@entity2 said the new @entity18 will meet for the first time on monday at the @entity32			2
it will have members from several government departments , including @entity59 , as well as other agencies , to help the @entity61 improve its ability to identify and respond more quickly to threats of atrocities , according to the @entity32 statement			0
" across government , alert channels will make sure that information about unfolding crises and dissenting opinions reach decision - makers , including me , " @entity2 said			0
other steps include what @entity2 called the first - ever intelligence assessment on the risk of mass atrocities and genocide , saying the goal is to " institutionalize the focus on this issue			0
" " our @entity81 will work more quickly to deploy its financial tools to block the flow of money to abusive regimes , " the president said			0
" our military will take additional steps to incorporate the prevention of atrocities into its doctrine and its planning			0
the @entity93 will surge our diplomats and experts in a crisis			0
" he received applause from the audience of @entity21 survivors and others when he said , in clear reference to the situation in @entity6 , that " national sovereignty is never a license to slaughter your people			1
" @entity2 has come under heavy criticism on foreign policy issues recently from @entity109 , including his certain opponent in the november election , @entity110 , and the president 's comments appeared aimed at defending a range of acts by his administration that he said saved " countless lives " around the world			2
calling the prevention of atrocities and genocide a " core national security interest " as well as a core @entity61 value , @entity2 added : " that does not mean that we intervene militarily every time there is an atrocity committed			1
we can not and should not			0
" instead , he cited a growing range of tools available and referred to specific achievements such as creation of the world 's newest nation of @entity132 as part of a treaty that ended decades of war , resolution of a leadership crisis in @entity138 and the resolution of the @entity141 crisis			0
@entity2 also announced that he is extending the work of @entity61 advisers in @entity144 helping pursue the @entity145 and its leader , @entity146 , who are accused of widespread atrocities			1
" today i can announce that our advisers will continue their efforts to bring this madman to justice and to save lives , " @entity2 said			0
monday 's visit to the holocaust memorial museum was @entity2 's first as president			2
he was accompanied by @entity157 winner @entity156 , a @entity21 survivor , who urged @entity2 and world leaders to prevent atrocities such as attacks on citizens occurring in @entity6			1
in particular , @entity156 said threats by @entity7 president @entity163 to use nuclear weapons to destroy @entity165 must be confronted			2
" how is it that the @entity21 number one denier -- @entity163 -- is still a president , " @entity156 said in introducing @entity2			2
" he who threatens to use nuclear weapons ... to destroy the jewish state			0
have we not learned ? we must know that when evil has power , it is almost too late			0
" in his remarks , @entity2 repeated his administration 's policy on the issue , saying : " the @entity61 will do everything in our power to prevent @entity7 from getting a nuclear weapon			1
" the president has come under criticism from @entity109 and some pro-israel groups for not taking stronger steps to prevent @entity7 from developing a nuclear weapon			2
@entity165 has made clear it is considering a military strike on @entity7 's nuclear energy facilities			0
the @entity2 administration argues it has worked with international partners to strengthen sanctions against @entity7 , and more time is needed for those steps to weaken the @entity7 economy and influence the regime 's behavior			1
@entity110 , in a speech earlier this year to the @entity201 group @entity200 , excoriated the administration 's " policy of engagement with @entity7 , " but erroneously asserted the president had opposed sanctions against @entity7 at that point			2
supporters of the administration were quick to point out that the most crippling set of sanctions against @entity7 since initial legislation was passed in the late 1990s occurred under @entity2 's watch			1
in his remarks monday , @entity2 also announced that he will award the nation 's highest civilian honor -- the @entity214 -- to the late @entity215 , a resistance figure who tried to alert the world to the @entity21 atrocities during @entity220 @entity1 's @entity221 contributed to this report .			0
