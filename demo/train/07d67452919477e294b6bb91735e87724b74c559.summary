-- wearing a floppy hat , 3 - year - old @entity1 does his best rendition of a rocket launch countdown , " three , two , one , zero -- blast off " and jumps up in the air next to a @entity7 launchpad where @entity9 rockets have blasted off for more than 50 years			1
@entity12 missions took the first men to the moon , space shuttles carried the @entity15 and the @entity16 into space -- all on rockets taking off from two launchpads at @entity20 , an hour east of @entity21			1
@entity1 , his twin brother , @entity23 , and his mother , @entity25 , are on a tour inside launchpad @entity28 's security fence at @entity20 -- something that has never been allowed in the history of the space center -- until now			1
the @entity33 , introduced in july , is one of three new rare - access tours being offered this year to celebrate @entity20 's 50th anniversary			1
in addition to getting an up - close look at the launchpad , visitors can also tour the @entity41 and the @entity42 with a space expert guide			1
" are you a space nut or were you forced to accompany one ? " a tour guide asks laughing guests on a bus taking them to the space center recently for one of the new tours			1
photos : @entity54 's otherworldy landscapes space nut or not , you 'll be amazed by the size of the @entity41 -- or @entity41 , if you want to sound like a @entity9 aficionado			1
the rocket hanger is one of the largest enclosed spaces in the world			1
the 525 - foot - tall building with the huge @entity9 logo and @entity65 flag painted on the side can be seen for miles on the ground and in the air -- look for it while flying over central @entity7			1
built in the 1960s , the hanger was designed to handle the assembling of huge @entity75 rocket segments during the @entity12 missions			2
later the space shuttle program used the assembly building to attach the shuttles to a large orange external fuel tank and two white rockets used during launch			2
once inside the large cavernous building , look up to the ceiling where shuttle mission banners filled with the signatures of the personnel who worked on those missions hang from support beams			2
as an added bonus , the shuttle @entity89 is parked inside the @entity41 just behind a fence only 25 feet away -- for now			2
the retired @entity89 is waiting to receive final preparations for public display			2
" it 's awesome to see it in real life , " said @entity95 , 30 , from @entity96 , @entity97 , who was on vacation in @entity7 for three weeks			2
" it 's not something you get to see every day			2
" @entity107 landing went ' flawlessly , ' scientists say @entity9 says @entity89 will be moved to a shuttle hanger on august 16 -- switching places with shuttle @entity110 , which will remain inside the assembly building until mid-september when it will be transported to the @entity114 in @entity115 for permanent public display			2
@entity89 will be back in the @entity41 briefly before it moves to its new permanent home at the visitor complex			0
still under construction , the new facility is expected to open to the public in july 2013			1
next to the tall @entity41 is the much smaller @entity42 with large windows looking to the east toward the launchpad			0
the control center is open to visitors for the first in more than 30 years			0
control center tours visit @entity129 4 , where @entity12 and shuttle managers directed launches			1
" there 's a lot of responsibility in this room			0
it 's not just one person who launches a space shuttle , " said tour guide @entity136 , pointing to a photo of the launch room that describes how the team works together			1
" you 'll feel the energy when you walk in this room , " said @entity136 as the security officer opened the door			0
@entity107 images from @entity9 's " @entity151 " rover inside , workstations line the room with labels for each position 's area of responsibility on top -- from @entity159			0
at the front , overlooking the room , is the workspace labeled @entity163			0
do n't expect to see a launch button			0
computers have launched rockets for years , though managers can override them			0
next to work spaces for the launch director and the public affairs officer are large windows overlooking the launchpad			0
" this is the window on mankind 's future right here , " says @entity136 , the guide , as we look out toward the launchpads , which appear much closer than three miles from the control center			1
during the @entity33 , guests step out of a bus inside the last high barbwire fence surrounding the launchpad			0
the massive jumble of metal service structures used during the shuttle program sit on top of a white concrete mound			0
@entity188 , a middle school science teacher who just moved to @entity7 from @entity190 , was glad for the opportunity to see the space center up close			1
" finally getting to see all the things that i told the kids about and my own children about for 50 years ... it 's amazing , " said @entity188			0
searching for life on the moons of @entity199 his friend @entity200 recalls watching launches as a girl on small black and white televisions			0
" i 'm seeing it in person			0
it 's wonderful , " said @entity200			0
@entity188 agreed , " it 's better , you saw those grainy black and white pictures and something over @entity212 's shoulder and now it 's real			0
" the new tours are expected to run through the end of december 2012 and possibly into 2013			1
each of the three tours costs an additional $ 25 for adults and $ 19 for children ages 3 to 11 beyond the entrance fee to the @entity221 , which is $ 45 for adults and $ 35 for children .			1
