-- there was so much -- so ! much ! -- to love about sunday night 's @entity2			1
to begin with , @entity3 finally won something ( much to her astonishment ) , and she did it while killing her hosting job with @entity7			1
over on our @entity2 live blog , we asked those watching with us how @entity7 and @entity3 were doing , and 81 % voted they were doing a-ok , with roughly half that saying the duo were even better than last year			1
that 's great news for the @entity16 , since they 've already booked @entity7 and @entity3 for a third round of @entity2			1
the comedic team were just as sharp as they were last year , although we 're curious who you think had the best one - liners			0
these were some of our favorite jokes of the night : @entity7 , introducing " gravity " during the opening monologue : " ' gravity ' is nominated for best film			1
it 's the story of how @entity30 would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age			0
" @entity3 , calling out @entity36 for breaking through with its original shows : " enjoy it while it lasts , @entity36			0
you 're not going to be feeling so smug in a couple of years when @entity41 is up here accepting best drama			0
" @entity7 , on @entity43 : " ( she 's ) so brilliant in ' august : @entity44 , ' proving that there are still great roles in @entity47 for @entity48 over 60			2
" @entity3 introducing one of @entity51 's new hit shows : " ' @entity52 , ' which is the degree i got from @entity54			2
" when @entity7 and @entity3 accused @entity57 of becoming a diva : " interestingly , @entity55 has chosen to sit in the film section tonight			2
hi , @entity55 ... you know us from tv			0
" @entity3 as @entity7 's " adult son from a previous relationship " ( who sadly did n't know his dad ) : @entity3 's heartwarming acceptance speech : @entity7 , introducing @entity69 : " like a supermodel 's vagina , let 's all give a warm welcome to @entity69			1
" those were some of the jokes that caused us to laugh the hardest			0
