-- an argument before the @entity2 on october 1 in @entity3 will have enormous significance			1
the case concerns the torture of @entity8 leaders in @entity9 , but at stake is the future of the law under which this case was brought , the @entity14			2
the @entity15 stands at a crossroads			2
at its best , our nation has played a crucial role in championing human rights throughout the world and pioneering human rights law			1
at its worst , it has abandoned its lofty ideals in the name of realpolitik and supported dictators and policies that were responsible for horrible abuses			0
passed in 1789 , the @entity14 was a prescient piece of legislation			0
it allows foreign victims of human rights abuses in foreign nations to seek civil remedies in @entity15 courts , and its animating idea -- that people anywhere should have recourse for violations of the " law of nations " -- was the foundation of our modern understanding of human rights			1
in the 1990s , @entity47 ( @entity48 ) had extensive oil drilling operations in the @entity50 in @entity9 , a region long plagued with poverty , human rights violations and environmental disaster			1
a popular movement of the @entity8 people resisting what they saw as reckless oil development in the region was violently suppressed by @entity9 's military dictatorship			0
in the suit , the plaintiffs accuse @entity48 of helping the former dictatorship in the arrests on false charges and torture of 12 members of the @entity8 tribe , who sought to peacefully disrupt @entity48 's operations because of the devastating health and environmental effects of unregulated drilling			0
all the plaintiffs were themselves tortured except @entity73 , who brought her claims on behalf of her late husband , @entity75			0
@entity75 was executed through a sham trial process in which the plaintiffs believe @entity48 played a central role			0
the @entity2 court accepted @entity3 last fall after a federal appeals court ruled that the statute could not be used to sue corporations			1
the justices indicated in february that they might question not just the application of the statute to corporations but whether and under what circumstances it applies to any human rights violations , even by individuals , that take place outside the @entity15			1
they ordered the case to be re-argued on exactly that question			2
the case has been brought in the @entity15 because of our nation 's historical role in promoting the idea of universal rights and in the development of international human rights law			1
from @entity106 's @entity105 speech and the @entity107 that @entity108 tirelessly worked for , to the stirring oratory of @entity110 at the @entity111 , mid-century @entity15 gave voice and visibility to the idea that all people , everywhere , were entitled to certain fundamental rights			2
since 1977 , the @entity117 has annually produced @entity118			0
the international leadership of the past century is a long way from where we find ourselves now			2
our own era is defined by a different legacy : one of waterboarding and " torture memos , " extraordinary renditions , indefinite detention at @entity130 and targeted killings in countries with which we are not at war			0
" the @entity15 is abandoning its role as the global champion of human rights , " @entity135 wrote bluntly in the @entity136 in june			1
@entity48 must aid @entity9 workers who were tortured , abused on this grim and morally and legally compromised horizon , the @entity14 is still one bright spot for human rights advocacy			1
in a groundbreaking case in 1980 , the family of a 17 - year - old @entity145 , @entity146 , who had been tortured and killed by a henchman of gen. @entity149 , brought and won a civil case against his murderer , @entity152			0
the young man had been tortured to death because his father opposed the government			0
the ruling established that the statute could be used to hold modern torturers accountable for their actions , wherever they are committed			0
in the wake of the case , @entity161 , the @entity14 developed into a new tool in human rights law			1
successful cases were brought against government officials , against non-state actors like @entity169 in @entity170 and against multinational corporations before the @entity173 ruling in @entity3 that disallowed that			0
it is this legacy that is at stake in the @entity75 case before the @entity2			2
the immediate questions before the court on october 1 concern the reach of the @entity14 and whether it will continue to be possible for people like the @entity183 and the @entity184 to pursue their tormentors and hold them accountable for their heinous acts , and whether corporations can be held to account			0
but the larger question is : does the @entity15 want to be a leader or a laggard in upholding international human rights ? if the statute is narrowed and its promise of universal accountability curtailed , it will rightly be perceived as yet another step by the @entity15 away from its once leading advocacy for human rights			1
if , on the other hand , the @entity2 upholds the @entity14 , it will signal to the world that we do still believe that people everywhere are entitled to certain fundamental rights and that we will help enforce those rights			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity210 : at its best , @entity15 has been key in championing universal human rights
@entity208 : a *longstanding* law lets foreign victims of human rights abuse find justice in @entity15 courts
@entity2 to rule in international human rights case whether law will stand , he says
@entity208 : if court upholds the law , the world will see @entity15 still supports human rights for all
