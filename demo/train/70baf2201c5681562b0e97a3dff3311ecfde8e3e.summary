-- first , there was " @entity2			0
" this expression summed up the extra challenges of being an @entity5 when flying on commercial airlines			0
this situation has become almost accepted as part of the @entity5 experience			0
in fact , i have even comically offered advice to people in my community on how to avoid extra problems when they fly : " dress white , make your flight			0
dress brown , never leave town			0
" but now there is something new : " studying while @entity23			1
" and there is nothing funny about it			0
documents obtained by @entity27 reveal that for the past few years , the @entity28 has been engaged in the weekly surveillance of @entity5 college groups at 16 schools across the @entity32 , including @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36			1
( the @entity28 has neither commented on the number of years that this surveillance was conducted nor if it 's still happening			1
) as part of this secret program , the @entity28 generated weekly reports about the @entity23 student groups at these schools			1
they even set up an undercover " safe house " near the campus of @entity35 to spy on students			0
ironically , that operation ended when the building superintendent became suspicious and called the police thinking the @entity28 officers were part of a terrorist cell			1
the @entity28 also sent an undercover officer on a whitewater rafting trip organized by @entity23 students at the @entity56			1
the @entity28 report indicates the students prayed four times a day and talked a lot about the nature of @entity62			1
no mention if @entity23 were good at whitewater rafting			2
on a personal note , in the past years , i have performed standup comedy at shows organized by the @entity23 student groups at many of the colleges that were under surveillance			1
is my name now in the counter-terrorism files of the @entity28 ? so why did the @entity28 spend our tax dollars to engage in the weekly undercover surveillance of students at 16 colleges ? did the @entity28 have evidence that students at each of the schools were a threat to @entity85 ? had the @entity86 warned the @entity28 to be on the lookout for terrorists disguised as college students ? did the @entity28 's research reveal that @entity92 operatives love to go whitewater rafting ? nope			1
it was simply because these students were @entity23			2
apparently , to the @entity28 , being @entity23 equals probable cause			1
no one should be surprised by this new revelation concerning the @entity28			2
after all , in late 2011 , the @entity27 also discovered that the @entity28 had been engaged in secret programs -- created with assistance from the @entity101 -- to monitor @entity85 muslims living in @entity103 at the places where they eat , shop and worship			1
let 's be brutally honest : if the @entity28 were engaged in this type of widespread spying on any other religious , ethnic or racial group , the criticism would be deafening			1
however , because the case involves @entity23 , the silence is deafening			2
there is simply no public outcry and little media coverage			0
if specific evidence indicated that an @entity5 -- or a person of any faith , for that matter -- were engaged in criminal activity , the police should vigilantly investigate that person			0
@entity85 muslims are not asking for special rights , just the same rights as all other @entity85			2
freedom of religion is not just the freedom to pray			2
it also is the freedom to avoid being harassed or being treated less than @entity85 simply because of your faith			1
that is a bedrock principle of our nation			0
authorizing the weekly surveillance of @entity5 students solely predicated on the fact that they are @entity23 is wrong			2
it is profiling at its worst			0
but the issue of @entity28 profiling appears to go beyond @entity23			1
as the @entity142 recently reported , in 2011 the @entity28 detained 684,330 @entity103 for questioning			2
of those stopped , 59 % were black , 26 % were @entity145 and 9 % were white			0
to put this in perspective , whites comprise 44 % of @entity103 residents , but they make up only 9 % of those stopped by the @entity28			0
but blacks -- who comprise 25 % of @entity103 --- represent 59 % of those stopped and questioned by the @entity28			0
it appears that the use of skin color , ethnicity and religion as the basis for investigations is standard @entity28 policy			1
that is both unconstitutional and morally wrong			0
@entity28 commissioner @entity161 needs to make it clear that illegal profiling has no place in his department			1
if he does not , @entity103 mayor @entity166 needs to replace him with someone who will respect the rights of all @entity103 regardless of their race , ethnicity or religion			0
follow @entity173 on @entity174 join the conversation on @entity176 the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

reports found @entity28 spied on @entity85 @entity23 college groups at 16 @entity32 colleges
@entity179 : if @entity28 had spied on any other group or faith , people would be outraged
freedom of religion also means freedom from harassment for your faith , he writes
@entity179 : commissioner @entity161 must stop @entity28 's illegal profiling
