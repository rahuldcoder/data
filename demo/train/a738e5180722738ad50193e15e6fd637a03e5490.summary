sorry , dear readers , but the crop circle discovered last week etched in a farmer 's barley field in @entity4 , @entity5 , was not created by aliens			1
instead -- surprise ! -- it was a stunt intended to attract publicity to the release of a mobile processor used in automobiles , tablets and cell phones made by the computer graphics company @entity14 , according to its president and ceo , @entity18			1
the @entity14 marketing team is behind this phenomenon , " @entity20 said as he stood in front of a picture of the manicured field			2
" what you 're looking at here is 310 feet in diameter			0
it is what people call a crop circle			1
" @entity20 made the announcement during a keynote address sunday night at the @entity36 in @entity37			0
" it 's like , out of this world , it 's practically built by aliens , " @entity20 said , referring to the new @entity39 graphics chip			1
elaborate crop circle in @entity5 mowed down @entity45 , who works as a marketer for the company , told @entity48 in a telephone interview that the idea emerged during a brainstorming session in early december about how to introduce the new product			1
they came up with the tag line , " impossibly advanced , " then tried to figure out how to " get some noise " around it , he said			0
from " impossibly advanced " to " aliens " was not a big leap			0
" we eventually said , ' you know , what 's graceful and alien ? crop circles			2
' " they then set to work , swearing everyone to secrecy , hiring a @entity67 location scout to find " the perfect field in @entity5 , " and flying in a @entity70 group who have made crop circles before			2
starting buzz for the creation , the company called anonymous tip lines for news stations in the @entity78 , telling them : " something 's going on out in @entity4			1
" a crudely made video also popped up on @entity81 purporting to show two men -- in reality , @entity45 and another @entity14 employee -- getting out of a car and looking at strange lights coming from the farmer 's field and then stumbling toward them			1
by the morning of december 30 , the news trucks were rolling in and , with them , throngs of curious onlookers			0
the company hired security to keep them from trampling over the farmer 's fields			2
@entity45 described the crop circle as " a puzzle out there for the world to solve			1
" the puzzle included clues to who was behind it -- for example , the number 192 is posted in two ways in the design -- as numbers on a clock and as a @entity113 representation			0
that 's the number of graphical processing unit cores in the new chip			2
at least one person appears to have figured it all out			0
@entity119 posted this at 12:16 a.m. wednesday , january 1 , on @entity121 : " the crop art really dose ( sic ) look like a graphics gpu chip if i had to bet ... one of the new @entity126 combos from @entity127 or @entity14 or intell			1
" @entity45 said he understood why the story attracted so much attention			0
" this is like @entity132 , " he said			0
" people want to believe			0

the crop circle is a publicity stunt
it 's being used to call attention to a new mobile processor
computer graphics company @entity14 developed the chip
the pr company made anonymous tips to local tv stations
