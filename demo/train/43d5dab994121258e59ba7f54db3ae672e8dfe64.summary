-- he has a face only a mother could love -- a mother who lives 1,000 to 3,000 feet under water and voraciously feeds on live squid and fish			1
we 're talking about a goblin shark -- only the second member of his species ever caught in the @entity13 , and the first since 2000 , shark expert @entity8 said			1
" beauty is in the eye of the beholder , " @entity8 , a @entity16 research biologist said			1
" some would call them ' ugly			2
' i think , ' interesting			2
' " @entity22 , 63 , of @entity23 , @entity24 , was the unlikely archeologist of this ichthyological wonder , which he estimates was 18 to 20 feet long			2
he caught it on april 19 , about halfway through an 18 - day fishing trip			0
@entity8 guesses it was closer to 15 feet , with the largest goblin shark ever measuring 18 feet			1
@entity22 decided an exact appraisal was n't in his best interest			0
" i was going to take the tape measure , then he flashed around again			0
i said , ' forget the measurement			0
that thing 'll eat me up ! ' " @entity22 has been shrimping the @entity38 and the @entity13 for 50 years , with a short break for a stint in the @entity41 , and he 's " caught so much weird stuff : sawfish , @entity45 anglefish , loggerback turtles weighing 1,000 to 1,500 pounds			2
" but when the goblin shark spilled out of his trawling net full of royal red shrimp , @entity22 felt " disbelief			1
" " first thing i told them boys was , ' man , he 's ugly ! looks prehistoric to me , ' " @entity22 said			0
goblin sharks do resemble some prehistoric species , and @entity8 said @entity22 made a " pretty important find			1
" they 're not seen anywhere all that often , though the coast of @entity60 boasts the shark 's share of recorded sightings			0
" we do n't know a lot about deep water fauna , " @entity8 said			1
" we know little about ( goblin sharks ) -- how long they live , how fast they grow			1
" one thing that 's fairly certain : at their size , goblin sharks have few natural predators , according to @entity8			1
the photographs @entity22 provided to @entity16 will help expand that knowledge			2
@entity8 said he and a colleague now are writing a paper on goblin sharks to submit to a scientific journal			1
and @entity8 can thank a 3 - year - old boy for that			0
@entity22 just recently began carrying a camera with him on his shrimping expeditions			0
he wants to share pictures of what he does with his grandson @entity86 , who turns 4 on wednesday			0
@entity22 released the shark after getting photographic evidence of his -- and just about anyone 's -- greatest fish story ever			2
" anything that 's alive we try to put back in the ocean , " he said			0
