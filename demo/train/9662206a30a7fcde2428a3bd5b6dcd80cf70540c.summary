the acting head of the @entity1 said thursday that evidence so far shows only conservative groups underwent extra scrutiny cited by an inspector general 's disclosure of the agency 's targeting of applications for tax exempt status			1
an initial report on the @entity1 targeting scandal this week by @entity13 , the @entity1 principal deputy commissioner , led to the disclosure that @entity1 workers flagged both liberal and conservative groups when assessing their eligibility for the tax break available to social welfare organizations			1
@entity1 screeners used conservative - themed criteria such as " tea party " on " @entity23 " or @entity24 lists to determine if groups underwent further review for political activity that would make them ineligible , according to @entity13 and the inspector general who first revealed the targeting			1
another category of the bolo lists also had liberal - themed criteria including " progressives , " but that category did n't set off the automatic extra scrutiny for political activity faced by conservative groups , according to a letter to the panel this week by @entity41			1
under tough questioning thursday at a @entity43 hearing , @entity13 acknowledged that the different bolo categories meant liberal groups avoided the extra scrutiny cited by the inspector general that included processing delays and extensive questions perceived by conservatives as political intimidation			1
the revelation bolstered the argument of @entity57 rep. @entity56 of @entity58 , the panel 's chairman , that the targeting had a political motive			2
" so far , the evidence only shows conservatives being systematically targeted by the @entity1 , not just flagged through the bolo , but actually targeted , " @entity56 said , later conceding " we 're in the early stages of this investigation			1
" @entity13 repeatedly cautioned that his internal review was incomplete , and that additional information from continuing investigations by the @entity70 , the inspector general and congressional committees was needed to reach definitive conclusions			0
he noted that the 80 groups that have waited more than 120 days for a final decision on their applications for a tax break included a diverse range of political leanings			0
" i did n't want to leave the committee with the impression that we 're not seeing diversity of political labels across the spectrum , " @entity13 said of the @entity1 targeting			1
" what i 'm suggesting is more analysis -- significant more analysis -- is needed before we reach conclusions about what that means in terms of an @entity1 failure or an @entity1 issue			0
" the hearing on the still - evolving scandal featured angry accusations and tense exchanges between legislators , with republicans inferring a government cover - up of high - level wrongdoing while @entity104 accused them of political posturing			0
all involved agreed that @entity13 needed more time to figure out exactly what happened , who was responsible and why			0
that did n't stop republicans from criticizing his efforts so far			0
@entity56 said @entity13 's report , filed just over a month after his appointment by president @entity113 to clean up the mess at the @entity1 , lacked accountability and reached unsubstantiated conclusions			1
" if there is anything this report shows , it 's just how much more work must be done , " @entity56 said , noting that @entity13 had yet to interview principal figures or get other information necessary to determine the origins or scope of the targeting			1
another @entity57 legislator , rep. @entity127 of @entity128 , called @entity13 's report " a sham			0
" @entity56 also warned @entity13 that the targeting scandal and other @entity1 controversies , such as wasteful spending in past years , would affect his panel 's consideration budget request for more money next year			1
" until the @entity1 proves that it can responsibly manage its current funds , the @entity1 will not see one more dime in taxpayer funding , " @entity56 said			2
@entity13 noted that the @entity70 and inspector general were handling interview of @entity1 officials involved in the targeting , adding that the investigations could involve criminal behavior			1
he repeated the assertion in his report that no evidence so far suggested intentional wrongdoing by agency personnel or influence from outside the @entity1 in the targeting			1
his report released monday said five managers had been replaced and other steps taken in response to @entity157 's audit last month that set off a political firestorm in @entity160			0
@entity57 leaders contend the targeting uncovered by the inspector general 's audit indicated political villainy by the @entity113 administration to try to stifle opponents , such as groups with " tea party " in their names that were flagged for additional @entity1 scrutiny			2
@entity104 said thursday that such allegations were politically motivated instead of based on any evidence			0
rep. @entity174 of @entity58 , the top @entity175 on the panel , asked @entity13 if there was any evidence of @entity180 involvement in the targeting , and @entity13 answered no. @entity1 targeting scandal reshaped by new details on wednesday , @entity180 spokesman @entity184 told reporters that " there 's been a lot of flagrant , unfounded accusations made by members of @entity190 in the @entity57 about this issue , accusations that were made without factual foundation			1
" @entity113 's second - term blues investigations by the @entity70 , congressional committees , the @entity199 inspector general 's office and the @entity1 continue			0
president @entity113 appointed @entity13 to clean up the @entity1 mess last month after the inspector general 's audit uncovered targeting of applications that contained conservative - themed words such as " tea party			1
" @entity157 's audit said the targeting resulted in some conservative groups having their applications delayed or stonewalled with requests for answers to inappropriate questions regarding donors , political beliefs and other matters			1
the targeting of conservative groups ended in may 2012 , the audit said			2
in his first substantive report on the agency , @entity13 said monday that its tax - exempt unit used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax - exempt applications until earlier this month , more than a year later than previously revealed			0
@entity13 said he has suspended the use of @entity24 lists in considering tax - exempt applications for now			0
@entity229 on @entity1 : who is going to jail ? @entity13 's report monday said the five @entity1 managers replaced included the previous acting commissioner he succeeded , as well as the head of the unit based in @entity237 that handles tax - exempt applications			1
in addition , @entity13 created an @entity240 to recommend within 60 days " any additional personnel actions necessary to hold accountable those responsible " for the targeting disclosed by the inspector general 's report			2
as part of his review , @entity13 said 80 groups awaiting @entity1 action on their applications for tax - exempt status for more than 120 days could self - register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations			2
at the heart of the matter is what kind of organization can qualify for tax - exempt status			0
regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities , while political groups are considered ineligible			0
confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the @entity1 , @entity13 said			2
an @entity1 statement monday said the " safe - harbor " option for self - certification would apply to groups that " certify they devote 60 % or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare			0
" " at the same time , they must certify that political campaign intervention involves 40 % or less of both their spending and time , " the statement said			0
applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self - certification , it said			0
@entity13 said the @entity1 would continue checking on tax - exempt groups to ensure they were following the law .			2
