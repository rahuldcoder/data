-- march 31 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 : we 're from @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			2
start your tractor , @entity19 ! @entity20 , @entity21 : we thank mrs. @entity23 's students in @entity16 for getting today 's show revved up and ready to go			1
and we thank all of you for checking out this thursday edition of @entity0			2
first up : changing strategy @entity28 : i 'm @entity30 , and first up today , we have a report from @entity0 's @entity32 on the conflict in @entity4			1
the @entity34 has been involved in this since march 19th , when it launched missiles at targets inside the @entity39 country			1
but the military strategy is shifting			1
( begin video ) @entity42 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : @entity34 officials say they 're not in @entity4 to help rebels win a war			1
vice admiral @entity46 , director of the joint staff : that 's not part of our mandate			1
@entity52 : but the coalition is launching missiles at specific units , like the headquarters of @entity4 's elite @entity57			1
@entity58 : this is one of @entity61 's most loyal units			1
@entity52 : the coalition has interpreted " protect civilians " to mean it can destroy any weapons @entity61 could use			2
air strikes hit munitions depots in two cities			2
@entity58 : any place that we can see ammunition storage facilities , things of that nature , that , we 're going after those			2
@entity52 : a mission that started with preventing attacks from the air is now focused , not even two weeks later , on destroying targets on the ground			2
new flying gunships like the @entity80 have replaced some of the ships that were firing cruise missiles			2
these new aircraft fly low , closer to a target , and shoot machine gun fire instead of dropping thousand - pound bombs			2
they 're designed to fight in and around cities , where rebels are trying to hold off @entity61 's forces			1
on tuesday , the @entity93 commander said that protecting civilians mandate extends all the way into @entity96 itself			2
@entity99 @entity98 , @entity93 @entity100 : i think that any @entity61 forces that are demonstrating hostile intent against the @entity4 population are legitimate targets			1
@entity52 : so far , the assault has cost the @entity107 well over half a billion dollars			2
but most of that money came from cruise missiles and other munitions			0
the strategy has shifted , and now the @entity34 forces are focused on refueling planes , jamming communication and striking @entity61 forces			1
so , the military only expects to spend $ 40 million over the next few weeks			0
and a spokeswoman says , " after that , we would incur added costs of about $ 40 million per month			0
" how many months ? it 's hard to tell			1
sen. @entity123 , ( r ) @entity124 : but a stalemate is not an acceptable solution			0
@entity127 : i think a stalemate is not in anybody 's interest			1
( @entity132 ) @entity4 @entity133 @entity28 : some rebel leaders in @entity4 are calling the battles ' front lines " fluid			1
" they made some advances , took control of some key cities			0
but colonel @entity61 's forces have pushed back			1
and yesterday , the rebels withdrew from some territory they had taken over before			0
one strategy that coalition military leaders are considering is arming the rebels , giving them weapons			1
president @entity147 has said he 's open to this idea , and some experts think it could give rebels help in fighting government forces			1
but there are also some concerns about this , arming the rebels			0
@entity34 intelligence indicates that some terrorists may be fighting on the side of the rebels			1
so of course , officials do n't want to be giving weapons to the wrong people			0
@entity165 @entity166 , @entity21 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity169 's students at @entity170 in @entity171 , @entity172 ! on this map of the @entity175 , which country is @entity5 ? you know what to do ! is it : a , @entity179 , c or @entity181 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! on this map , @entity179 is @entity5 , a country that 's home to more than 22 million people			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity189 @entity28 : @entity5 is another country in that part of the world that 's dealing with political unrest			1
dozens of people have been killed over the last few weeks in fighting between @entity5 security forces and protesters who are speaking out against their government			1
the protesters , here 's what they want : changes to @entity5 's constitution and the end of an emergency law that 's been in place in @entity5 for decades			1
yesterday , @entity5 president @entity207 spoke to his country about this unrest			0
he said he recognizes that @entity5 want reform and acknowledges that the government has n't met the needs of the @entity5 people			0
but president @entity207 also referred to an anti-syria " conspiracy , " and said his country wo n't fall like others that have gone through revolutions recently , like @entity219 , for example			0
one thing president @entity207 did n't address was that emergency law that protesters want lifted			0
@entity224 @entity28 : it 's been nearly 10 years since the 2001 terrorist attacks on the @entity34			1
after those attacks , @entity227 created the @entity229			0
the goal was to investigate the country 's counterterrorism policy and to give recommendations for how to help avoid future attacks			1
a @entity236 committee is holding hearings to discuss how prepared the @entity34 is for another possible attack			1
yesterday , they heard the opinions of some members of that @entity229 who said that , in many ways , the @entity34 is safer today from that kind of terrorist attack			1
but they also had a warning : they said the threat of terrorism has changed			0
the commission 's chairman said , " although a devastating 9/11 - type attack we believe is less likely , the threat is more complex and it 's more diverse than at any time in the last decade			1
" what 's the @entity256 ? @entity257 , @entity21 : what 's the @entity256 ? it 's a term that advertisers use to describe a group of people who share similar characteristics , such as age demographic that 's the word ! tvs watching you ? @entity28 : advertisers use those demographics to decide which ads to show to which people			1
for example , if you 're trying to promote an action movie , advertisers believe they 're better off showing that to a younger , male audience than to an older , female audience			0
@entity279 is looking at new technology that does n't just let advertisers target a specific group			1
it lets them target specific individuals			1
( begin video ) @entity286 , @entity0 correspondent : every time you watch tv , your tv is likely watching you through that box which collects information on show after show after show			0
all that data sent anonymously , ultimately to advertisers , focused on reaching people likely to buy certain products or watch certain shows			0
what is the benefit to people like me ? to consumers ? @entity306 , president , @entity308 : the benefit to consumers is that you get more relevant ads and you have fewer ads that are irrelevant to you that are cluttering up your tv experience			0
@entity315 : @entity316 of @entity317 successfully helped pioneer targeted advertising on the @entity320			0
now , he 's doing it with tv			1
if this is done right , how much money is this worth to advertisers ? @entity325 : we think billions			0
@entity315 : why ? because what you watch tells a lot about you , sometimes unexpectedly			0
@entity325 : a rerun of " @entity334 " at 9:00 a.m. on saturday morning has been one of the most highly effective spots in driving , let 's say , audiences to a crime drama several days later			1
@entity315 : it 's not just set box data , but your other personal data collected when you ask for credit reports or use retail discount cards			2
tech companies like @entity345 use this data like direct mail , and can now deliver different ads to different households watching the same program			0
how does the box know which of these four different ads to get to you ? @entity353 , ceo , visible world : so , we 've built a database that talks to @entity358 and sends out these little messages so the set - top boxes switch at the right time to show the right ads in your household			0
@entity315 : as for privacy , @entity366 writer @entity365 says it 's a tradeoff			2
@entity369 , advertising age : that 's becoming , you know , kind of the new tipping point of how much information we want to give out there and how much will advertisers use to kind of know where we are , where we 're walking , what we like , what we do n't like , what our preferences are in exchange for more relevant , more interesting advertising			2
@entity315 : commercial advertisers are banking you 'll watch			0
@entity279 , @entity0 , @entity389			0
( @entity132 ) @entity390 @entity28 : you can see how this benefits advertisers , and it brings up a couple interesting questions			0
would you benefit from seeing ads that were more relevant to the things you wanted , or do you think this might be a bit of an invasion of privacy , if people know what you 're watching and when you 're watching it ? you see our blog from our front page right there , @entity409 with me			0
head to @entity412 , click into this blog , and tell us your comments ; tell us what you 're thinking about this			0
before we go @entity28 : the competition you 're about to see started out with 75 people			0
after nearly two straight days of dribbling , it was down to just these two			0
you can sit , stand , bend , eat ; you just got ta keep dribbling			0
but when one guy reaches down to get a banana , oh no ! he knows it 's over ! the ball just got away from him when he was going for that banana			2
the winner -- hey , contest 's over , you can probably stop dribbling			2
anyway , the winner gets to join the @entity432 's @entity431 on a road trip next season			2
goodbye @entity28 : as for the runner - up , we are sure he 'll bounce back from this			0
we 'll bounce back tomorrow with more @entity0			0
look forward to seeing you then			0
