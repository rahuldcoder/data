-- when two continents collide , there 's inevitably going to be some chaos			2
so it is in @entity5 , on the cusp of @entity7 and @entity8 , where a serene skyline of domes and minarets looks down on streets teeming with traffic , traders and tourists			1
while it seems as if every inch of the city is consumed by the tumult , there are oases of calm			1
the @entity24 islands are , for most @entity5 residents , the ultimate weekend getaway , offering an escape where , crucially for anyone who 's ever endured they city 's motoring snarl - ups , cars are banned			1
a boat ride away in the @entity35 , the islands offer a soothing natural environment , sightseeing and cycle rides			1
and because this is still @entity5 , there 's also great food			1
there are nine @entity43 , of which @entity44 and @entity45 are the two of the largest and most popular			1
here 's what to do look out for : @entity44 to make the best of @entity44 , the largest of the islands , it 's best to escape the town square -- almost permanently inhabited by a flock of dazed - looking tourists -- and head by foot or cycle to more peaceful areas			1
the square is , however , home to an abundance of bike rental places , so it 's worth dropping 20 @entity62 ( $ 9.20 ) on a set of wheels			2
those not into cycling or walking can take a ride on the island 's most popular mode of transport : a small horse - drawn carriage known as a fayton			1
these hoof around the major sights for about 30tl per person , or can be hired for day - long guided tours for about 80tl per hour			1
once out of the town center , @entity44 begins to reveal its charms as nature mingles beguilingly with @entity83 - style architecture			1
getting lost in the maze of backstreets is almost as pleasurable as exploring the island 's upper areas , covered by lush pine forests			0
@entity89 the 6th century @entity91 church and monastery , located on @entity44 's highest hill , is one of the island 's most significant features			1
it 's relatively easy to cycle here or arrive by @entity73 ( the trip costs about @entity102 ) but the 20 - minute slog on foot is worth the effort			2
the reward comes in the form of a magnificent sea view of distant @entity5 , and also the historic @entity111 church 's beautiful interior			1
walkers might glimpse sewing thread stretching from the path 's beginning to end -- the remnants of a ritual believed to grant wishes that is performed annually on april 23 by the faithful			0
@entity120 most people visit @entity44 on day trips , but it 's possible to stay longer			1
@entity124 is more of an intercultural relaxation center than a hotel , offering yoga and meditation classes and shiatsu and @entity131 massages			0
however the lovely wooden villa , with a @entity35 view surrounded by palm trees and flowers , does have a handful of airy rooms available to rent			0
@entity120 , @entity138 no. 96 ; +90 0216 382 45 98 @entity139 the town center 's seafood restaurants tend to be overcrowded , so it 's worth seeking out this hidden cafe with overtly friendly staff and a terrier named @entity146			0
with a few tables set in a garden and an open kitchen area , @entity148 's modest menu includes an all - day @entity153 breakfast , with sahanda sucuklu yumurta ( fried eggs with cured @entity153 sausage served in a metal pan ) among favorites			2
the only downside of this secluded corner is the envy experienced when gawping at the owners ' minimalist glass and steel house behind the cafe			0
@entity139 , @entity138 no. 110 ; +90 216 382 35 78			0
@entity45 @entity45 boasts many similar activities to @entity44 , but is arguably more pleasant as it 's quieter and less touristy			1
there are bike rentals ( @entity169 an hour and @entity170 for the day ) and fayton rides , but walking around the island is a rewarding experience , with little cafes , shops , flower sellers , lounging street cats , and remarkable architecture all waiting to be discovered			2
@entity179 visible from the ferry to the island , this amazing structure perched on the highest peak and surrounded by pine trees was once a theology school run by the formidably - named @entity187 's @entity186			2
the @entity188 closed its doors as a school in 1971 but is open to visitors today			0
the premises also house the @entity194 church ( @entity195 ) and a garden with a view so breathtaking that it might makes a pretty convincing case for divinity in its own right			0
the school 's library still functions and welcomes researchers to its vast collection of 120,000 antique books on geography , history , theology , and philosophy			0
@entity210 located close to the town center , this street has some of @entity45 's most notable shops and cafes			1
among them is @entity216 , offering more than 70 kinds of jam and marmalade made by the owner			0
next door , the vintage styled @entity223 has a menu of homemade @entity153 favorites and baked goods , and a small shop of handicrafts and organic soaps			0
across the street , @entity230 sells handmade notebooks , items made from deformed gramophone records , birds made from pine cones , and many other unique items			0
the shop next door sells antique radios , furniture , and accessories			0
for lunch or dinner , @entity244 , across from the @entity243 station , is one of the best options with a colorful @entity249 decor and meze ( cold starters ) such as grilled calamari and patlıcan ezmesi ( eggplant puree )			0
getting there the easiest way to get there is by ferry , or vapur as they 're known locally			0
from the @entity8 side , the boats push off from either the @entity263 or @entity264 ports almost hourly and make stops at @entity44 and @entity45 plus the smaller islands of @entity267 , @entity268			1
from the @entity7 side , ferries depart almost every hour from @entity271 , making a stop in @entity264 and continuing on to the islands			2
passengers can pay using the @entity275 ( a rechargable card used for all public transportation ) or buy a single ticket ( jeton ) from the machines located in or around the ports			0
the ferry ride takes about 90 minutes			0
a faster option is @entity243 , a smaller boat that goes directly from either @entity271 or @entity263 to each of the islands separately on an hourly basis			2
@entity288 is a freelance journalist living in @entity5 , @entity153 .			1

the @entity43 offer citizens of @entity5 a peaceful escape from their *frenetic* city
@entity44 and @entity45 are the two largest and most popular of the islands
the islands are car - free havens , rich in flora and *exotic* @entity83 - style architecture
