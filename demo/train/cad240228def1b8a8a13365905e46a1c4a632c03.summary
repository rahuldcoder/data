-- former world no. 1 @entity1 is confident he is returning to top form ahead of his first @entity4 appearance of 2012 at @entity5 this week			1
the @entity6 clinched 14 majors between 1997 and 2008 , but has struggled with injury over the last two years and has not won an officially sanctioned tournament since november 2009			1
but @entity1 has shown signs of improvement in recent months , winning the @entity13 event he hosts in december and finishing tied for third at last weekend 's @entity15			1
the 36 - year - old , who has also gone through a high - profile divorce after admitting extramarital affairs , said he is now able to train thoroughly , rather than rehabilitating the leg injuries which have plagued him in recent years			1
why golf ( and big business ) still need @entity1 " rehabbing and training are two totally different scenarios , " he told reporters ahead of the @entity24 , which starts thursday and offers a winner 's purse of $ 1.152 million			1
" i have n't been able to train			2
i have n't been healthy enough			2
i 'm now training and my body is feeling explosive again			0
consequently i 'm hitting the ball further			0
" @entity1 entered the final round of last week 's @entity34 event tied for the lead with eventual winner @entity36 , but found only two fairways over the last 18 holes and finished two shots behind the @entity40			1
despite missing out on victory , @entity1 was encouraged by his performance in the @entity43			1
" that was my bad day and it was n't that bad			0
i know the stats show i only hit two fairways , but i landed the ball on eight and ran through it , " he said			0
" my stats said i hit six greens , but i putted from off the green four times so that 's 10 greens			2
if i can have that as my bad ball - striking day , we 're looking pretty good			2
" @entity1 has won a total of 71 @entity4 events since turning pro in 1996 -- only the legendary duo of @entity61 with 73 and the late @entity62 on 82 have claimed more			1
now ranked 18th after falling outside the top 50 last year , he admits that practicing and preparing for tournaments gets harder the older he gets			0
" the more we age , the more time we need to heal , " he said			2
" i do n't recover quite as well			0
" i know that i 'm sore quite often , just about every day when i 'm playing with my kids			0
i do n't remember ever being like that			0
i just have to train smarter , practice smarter			0
