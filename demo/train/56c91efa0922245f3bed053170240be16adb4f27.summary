@entity0 -- @entity2 seemed to channel his inner ceo on thursday when he sketched out a chart on entitlements on a whiteboard			1
there he stood , hair slicked down , white shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows , listing differences between his and president @entity14 's @entity13 plans			2
if the scene seemed better suited to a corporate boardroom than the campaign trail , it is because the presumptive @entity21 presidential nominee is far more comfortable throwing out ideas than with having them challenged , experts say			1
" it speaks to some of the issues he 's been having , " said @entity24 , a political communication professor at the @entity25			2
" there are a number of ways in which businesses operate that are not analogous to the campaign context			2
" the challenge for @entity2 is making the case to voters that his business acumen is exactly the skill set needed to pull the country out of its economic slump			1
" that 's what he needs to sell the public so the public can be comfortable with a president @entity2 , " said @entity43 , chairman of @entity45 's political science department			1
so far , it is an effort that has met with mixed results			0
in a @entity1 / @entity56 poll of likely voters released last week , 45 % of those polled said that the economy would get better if @entity2 were elected -- two percentage points below @entity14 's number			1
considering @entity2 's success as a business leader and the poor state of the economy , @entity2 should have higher poll numbers , @entity1 senior political analyst @entity61 said recently			1
then there was @entity2 's impromptu news conference on thursday on @entity13 which steered off course from the economy , arguably a topic that should be @entity2 's strong suit			1
the candidate found himself once again discussing his taxes in an attempt to put to rest previous questions by reporters on whether he would re-examine his returns			2
" i did go back and look at my taxes and over the past ten years			0
i never paid less than 13 %			0
i think the most recent year is 13.6 or something like that			0
i paid taxes every single year , " @entity2 said in a response aimed at quelling criticism from senate majority leader @entity82 that the former @entity84 governor did not pay taxes for a decade			2
at times on the trail , @entity2 has appeared frustrated with constant questions about his taxes and calls for him to release more returns			1
that type of umbrage could speak to @entity2 's discomfort in such a public sphere , @entity24 said			1
@entity2 is a @entity98 law and @entity100 graduate and led @entity102 's @entity101 , a private equity firm			1
he served one term as governor , the only public office he has held			0
as someone who has spent most of his life in the private sector , constant questions about tax returns could feel like an invasion of privacy			2
questions about his taxes " do seem small - minded to someone with his worldview , " @entity24 said			2
" his personal communication style comes out of that ( business ) background			0
to be relentlessly asked about those questions is probably bothersome			0
" @entity121 , an assistant finance professor at @entity122 put it more bluntly			0
" that is somebody who is used standing in front of a boardroom and not being challenged			0
' i do n't have to provide you evidence , that 's beneath me ' , " he said of @entity2 's attitude on releasing more tax returns			1
however , there are areas where @entity2 's business background has helped him steer clear of potential political pitfalls			1
his search for a running mate was handled with corporate - like precision			0
conversations about who topped the list were treated as trade secrets			0
documents about the search were kept in a safe and the selection process was only discussed among key people who sat in a room at campaign headquarters			0
@entity2 was also reportedly very methodical in his process			2
he solicited the advice of trusted advisers , carefully weighed his decision and then unveiled his choice in a showy roll out worthy of a brand launch			2
@entity2 's chief executive background was evident in his choice of @entity160 @entity21 and conservative budget hawk rep. @entity161 as a running mate , @entity121 said @entity121 said @entity2 likely reasoned " ' people are already basing their opinions on me based on what i have or have not said , but if i choose a good number two then i look more like a good boss ' , " @entity121 said			1
" a good ceo would choose managers around them that would challenge them in order to make the whole company better			0
" @entity161 and @entity2 's budget plans diverge in the level of detail â € ” @entity161 's has more in the way of specifics â € ” and offering a time line of when the federal budget would balance			1
@entity2 acknowledged the differences and suggested room to use his running mate 's ideas to help make his own plans stronger			1
" i 'm sure there are places that my budget is different than his , but we 're on the same page as i said before , " @entity2 said on the trail on monday			2
" we 'll look at the differences			0
well , the items we agree on i think outweigh any differences there may be			0
we have n't gone through piece by piece			0
... i ca n't imagine any two people even in the same party who have exactly the same positions on all issues			0
" @entity2 's ceo background will also help him in other ways			1
some people erroneously think that the government can be run like a corporation and will give @entity2 greater benefit of the doubt on his ability to right the economy because he was a ceo , @entity121 said			1
he 'll also benefit from a cultural tradition of not questioning the boss			0
" because he is a ceo there is a large share of people who are willing to just give him a pass , " @entity121 said			0
but government does n't function like a board of directors meeting , @entity121 said			0
as president , @entity2 would have to contend with @entity222 and all of the checks and balances that come with governing			2
" you ca n't exactly have an executive president , " @entity121 said			0
" what a ceo might bring to the @entity229 gets eliminated immediately because you ca n't have that kind of power			1
" during the upcoming nominating convention and debates @entity2 will have to prove to the broader electorate that he has the ability to not only run a successful business but also successfully run the country , political experts say			1
@entity2 's ready for the challenge , said @entity241 , a @entity21 strategist and senior vice president at @entity243			1
" a ceo delegates a lot , " @entity241 said , noting that @entity2 has been out in front during the campaign and taking the tough questions			1
as president , @entity241 said he could see him running the government like a ceo and delegating offices and responsibilities			0

@entity2 's experience as a ceo both helps and hurts his campaign
political experts say @entity2 seems *unused* to tough tax questions
@entity2 's choice of @entity161 as a veep was a solid ceo - worthy move
@entity2 will have to work to prove his business skills will translate to @entity229
