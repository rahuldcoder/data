ayatollah @entity12 says the @entity4 president is following " anti-islamic and @entity11 " policies			2
ayatollah @entity12 also called @entity17 concerns about @entity3 's nuclear ambitions -- which @entity19 says are only for energy purposes -- " purely a fabrication by the @entity4 , " according to the @entity22			1
" this is something that is in the doctrine of @entity11 , since the policy and the 30 - year - old history of the @entity28 has proven that @entity3 wants to live in peace and under the spirit of equality and fraternity , with its @entity34 neighbors and the rest of the world , " ayatollah @entity12 said			2
on thursday , president @entity10 said the @entity4 is significantly overhauling @entity38 - era plans for a missile defense shield in @entity7 , based partly on the latest analysis of @entity3 's offensive capabilities			1
the " new missile defense architecture in @entity7 " will be ready faster , work with existing technology and provide better missile defense than the program proposed by former president @entity38 , @entity10 said			0
@entity10 said the change of gears was based on an " updated intelligence assessment " about @entity3 's ability to hit @entity7 with missiles			1
the @entity28 's " short - and medium - range " missiles pose the most current threat , he said , and " this new ballistic missile defense will best address " that threat			0
@entity12 , speaking on the first day of @entity57 , a festive end to the @entity34 holy month of @entity59 , countered by comparing @entity10 to his predecessor			0
" @entity4 , under its former president , spared no efforts against the @entity34 world as well as against @entity3 , " @entity12 said			2
" even the current administration -- with the apparently friendly words and messages -- follows that same anti-islamic and @entity11 policy of the past			0
" the @entity38 - era proposal called for the @entity4 to set up a radar site in the @entity73 and 10 missile interceptors in @entity75 to counter the threat of @entity3 launching long - range missiles at @entity4 's allies in @entity7			1
the new system will have " hundreds " of missile interceptors instead , a @entity80 official said last week			0
it also will have mobile radars , including some in space , " that can move to wherever the threat actually emanates and wherever we feel we need to defend ourselves , " said gen. @entity89 , vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .			0
