-- as football 's reputation continues to be dragged through the mud following accusations of bribery during the @entity10 bidding process , the man charged with repairing the sport 's image revealed he is close to concluding his investigation			1
@entity13 lawyer @entity12 , who is set to meet @entity15 officials in @entity16 following allegations of wrongdoing , will finish his work on june 9 before publishing his report six weeks later			1
in a statement published monday , his office said : " after months of interviewing witnesses and gathering materials , we intend to complete that phase of our investigation by june 9 , 2014 , and to submit a report to the @entity28 approximately 6 weeks thereafter			1
the report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process , including evidence collected from prior investigations			1
" the statement comes a day after allegations surfaced claiming a @entity15 official paid more than $ 5million in an attempt to secure support for his country 's successful bid to host the 2022 tournament			1
according to allegations in @entity43 , @entity41 made secret payments to soccer officials in the run up to the controversial ballot			1
@entity47 , the former president of the @entity48 , was a member of @entity10 's powerful 24 - person executive committee charged with voting on who hosted the finals at the time of the vote in 2010			2
despite the country 's small size , a technical report from @entity10 calling its bid " high risk " and summer temperatures that can exceed 50 degrees @entity57 ( 122 degrees @entity58 ) , @entity15 shocked the world by winning the right to host the 2022 finals , defeating bids by the @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
@entity10 vice-president @entity70 has said he would back a re-vote , potentially opening the possibility of the @entity66 staging the 2022 tournament			1
@entity73 , who heads the @entity74 , believes the latest allegations could " shake @entity10 to its foundations "			2
he told @entity0 : " it 's the first time that an institution like @entity10 has to ask itself whether it should totally re-run the decision of a host , the hosting decision , and the consequences could be massive			2
it could be about billions of dollars			0
" at the moment , we have two options open			0
we could say ' ok , let 's have the evidence , let 's run the case '			0
" the problem is that there are two appeal bodies , this could drag on for two or three years , and in two or three years a lot has been planned and built , so the price tag is going to be really high			0
" we 've heard enough of @entity15 now , let 's call a stop immediately , but the difficulty there is , who is going to prove corruption , right now ? " what we have at the moment is , obviously , emails and they would have to be tested , whether they 're genuine , they could be fake , so there has to be a thorough investigation conducted under all circumstances			2
" when @entity10 voted on who should host the @entity116 in 2010 , the organization 's president @entity113 reportedly voted for the @entity66 , while a potential rival for the presidency , @entity120 chief @entity119 , voted for @entity15			1
the @entity43 claims to have seen millions of e-mails detailing payments to officials in the @entity124 , @entity125 and the @entity126 designed to secure support for the tiny , gas - rich @entity130 emirate 's quixotic bid to host the world 's most popular sports tournament			0
" bit by bit , we have been unraveling it and finally we hit the mother lode , " @entity133 , deputy editor of the @entity43 , told @entity0 in an interview			0
" we 've seen millions of documents that prove without a shadow of doubt that corruption was involved			0
there is clear evidence linking payments to people who have influence over the decision of who hosted the @entity10			0
" you also have a bunch of officials with a bearing on the vote begging favors			0
they were prepared to sell their influence			0
what @entity41 was doing was buying people up who could have influence			0
" @entity41 responded by saying he would not be making any comments other than he believed " that the truth will find its way to ( the ) public one way or another			0
" the @entity15 2022 bid committee strenuously denies any wrongdoing or knowledge of any payments made on its behalf			1
" @entity41 played no official or unofficial role in @entity15 's @entity174 , " it said in a statement sent to @entity0			1
" as was the case with every other member of @entity10 's executive committee , our bid team had to convince mr. @entity41 of the merits of our bid			1
... " following today 's newspaper articles , we vehemently deny all allegations of wrongdoing			0
" we will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the integrity of @entity15 's bid and our lawyers are looking into this matter			0
" the right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the @entity130 to host its first @entity10			2
" almost as soon as @entity15 won the bid to host the @entity116 finals , the process was dogged by allegations of bribery and corruption			1
in the run - up to the 2010 vote , two @entity10 executive committee members were suspended after another @entity43 investigation filmed @entity205 's @entity204 and @entity207 's @entity206 appearing to offer to sell their votes in exchange for money			2
@entity47 was banned from all football - related activities for life after first being accused of offering bribes to soccer officials in the @entity124 seeking support for his doomed 2011 bid to replace @entity113 as @entity10 president			0
he was cleared of those allegations after a hearing at the @entity221 but was later banned for different " conflict of interest " charges relating to his time as @entity48 president			0
the @entity43 ' allegations come ahead of a @entity10 - commissioned ethics investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments			1
that two - year investigation has been led by @entity12			2
" we are cooperating fully with mr. @entity12 's ongoing investigation and remain totally confident that any objective enquiry ( sic ) will conclude we won the bid to host the @entity116 fairly , " the @entity15 bid team added in its statement			1
