-- if the @entity4 military were to intervene in an increasingly chaotic @entity5 , it would most likely be part of a @entity7 action in which @entity9 bloodshed has reached a humanitarian crisis , analysts said thursday			1
as reports emerged thursday about deadly clashes between leader @entity15 's forces and anti-government protesters in the town of @entity18 near @entity19 , analysts highlighted how @entity15 has already pledged to fight a rebellion to martyrdom			1
military intervention " is something which i hope does n't happen , but it looks as though at some point that it should happen , " said @entity25 , senior fellow at the @entity26			1
" what 's an acceptable number of civilian deaths ? i do n't know			2
choose your figure , " @entity25 said			0
" at the very least , instead of having a casualty list certainly in the hundreds , possibly in the thousands , we do n't want a casualty list numbering in the tens of thousands , or 100,000 or so			0
" after 10 days of protest , @entity15 has lost control of the eastern portion of a country he has ruled for 42 years , and analysts portrayed him as a dictator desperately clinging to power			1
members of his government have defected , and in a sign of growing international pressure , @entity48 ordered thursday that @entity15 's assets be frozen			1
" you 've got to assume the worst about @entity15 , " @entity52 , a professor at @entity53 and former under secretary of state between 2005 and 2008 , told @entity0			2
" with his back to the wall , he 's going to go out in a blaze of vicious attacks			0
" @entity7 defense chiefs ought to be holding discussions about " not taking action but preparation " for the @entity9 crisis , said @entity65 , a @entity66 expert who worked in the @entity67 under president @entity68			1
" i do n't think anyone is talking about immediate military actions now , " @entity65 told @entity0 , especially as 167 @entity4 citizens are waiting on a ferry to leave @entity5			1
@entity4 officials have said all options were under consideration , including sanctions and enforcement of a no - fly zone , to try to keep the @entity9 government from attacking protesters			1
@entity81 , deputy director of @entity82 in @entity83 , interpreted that statement as indicating that military force remains a possibility			2
" in my opinion , it 's still premature to talk about @entity4 military intervention in @entity5 at this point , but we should not eliminate it completely , " @entity81 said			1
meanwhile , the @entity67 recommended thursday that the 6,000 or so @entity4 in @entity5 " depart immediately due to the potential for ongoing unrest			2
" @entity5 's disintegration , the latest @entity66 uprising that has already toppled autocracies in nearby @entity19 and @entity99 , poses greater impacts to @entity101 than the @entity4 , analysts said			1
@entity104 's largest oil producer , @entity5 exports 1.5 million barrels a day , mostly to @entity101 , which relies on the country for 10 % of its energy needs , analysts said			2
meanwhile , refugees fleeing @entity9 violence are expected to land in such @entity101 countries as @entity112 , analysts said			1
on thursday , president @entity114 spoke with the leaders of @entity116 , @entity112 and the @entity117 on coordinating an international response to the crisis in @entity5 , the @entity113 said			0
in separate phone conversations with @entity116 president @entity130 , @entity112 prime minister @entity131 and @entity117 prime minister @entity132 , @entity114 " expressed his deep concern with the @entity9 government 's use of violence , which violates international norms and every standard of human decency , and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond , " the @entity113 statement said			2
while some critics say the @entity114 administration has been slow to react to @entity5 , the statement said thursday 's discussions were to " coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure that there is appropriate accountability			0
" " the leaders discussed the range of options that both the @entity4 and @entity101 countries are preparing to hold the @entity9 government accountable for its actions , as well as planning for humanitarian assistance , " the @entity113 statement said			1
complicating any consideration of military intervention is how @entity4 and @entity101 armed forces have been strained from repeated deployments to @entity152 and @entity153 for almost 10 years , analysts said			1
@entity5 's factions and tribalism would make an intervention perilous , said @entity157 , director of military analysis for the global intelligence firm @entity158 , @entity159			2
" it 's not clear what a @entity5 looks like , " @entity157 said			0
" it 's a very messy situation			0
it would be a very difficult situation to jump into militarily			0
" there are no geographical boundaries			0
there are soft demographic , cultural and tribal boundaries			0
to get enmeshed in that without understanding the local culture ... it would be a pretty tough spot to put troops in , " @entity157 added			0
" once the writing is on the wall that @entity15 is going to go likely to go , the incentive for the various tribal factions and other factions within @entity5 is to maneuver to make sure they have a place in whatever comes next			2
" were @entity7 to send armed forces into @entity5 , the rest of the @entity187 world would n't protest much , the analysts said			1
" i do n't think they would have any problem with this			0
i would suspect that the @entity187 world would support this , " @entity81 said			0
added @entity25 : " on day one , they would probably think it 's a good idea			0
on day two , come back and ask ... me			0

@entity9 leader @entity15 has pledged to fight the rebellion to martyrdom
analysts say @entity4 military intervention is a remote thought for now
but if bloodshed *spirals* out of control , @entity4 may be likely to join a @entity7 intervention
