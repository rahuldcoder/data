fear over @entity1 is growing as international leaders and health organizations struggle to try to stop the deadly epidemic in @entity5			1
the @entity1 outbreak " is moving faster than our efforts to control it , " @entity6 , director - general of the @entity7 , said in a statement friday			1
" this is an unprecedented outbreak accompanied by unprecedented challenges			1
and these challenges are extraordinary			2
" this is the first @entity1 outbreak in @entity5 and involves the most deadly strain in the ebola virus family , @entity15 said			1
" if the situation continues to deteriorate , the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries			2
" one of those countries could be the @entity28 , health officials have said			1
in fact , the @entity28 @entity29 announced friday that it is working with the @entity31 to bring home two @entity28 citizens who have been infected by @entity1 in @entity33			1
here 's what you need to know about the @entity1 outbreak today : how many people have died ? as of sunday , the @entity7 had confirmed 909 cases and 485 deaths in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity33 and @entity43			1
it suspects that there may have been up to 1,323 cases and 729 deaths			2
" the outbreak is by far the largest ever in the nearly four - decade history of this disease , " @entity15 said			2
" it is the largest in terms of numbers of cases and deaths			2
... it is the largest in terms of geographical areas already affected and others at immediate risk of further spread			2
" @entity31 director @entity61 said thursday that it could take three to six months to stop the epidemic			2
why is it spreading so quickly ? first of all , there 's no vaccine for @entity1			1
so health officials have to stop the infection by isolating patients to prevent further transmission			2
past outbreaks have primarily occurred in rural areas , where people were not frequently traveling and infecting others			2
this outbreak has made it to several of the region 's major cities , including @entity79 , @entity42 ; @entity80 , @entity33 ; and @entity81 , @entity41			2
these cities have international airports , which opens up the possibility of infected patients traveling abroad			1
for example , @entity28 @entity86 became infected with @entity1 in @entity33 and traveled via plane to @entity89 , @entity43 , where he died			1
health officials are still tracing all the people he came in contact with along the way			0
the outbreak is " taking place in areas with fluid population movements over porous borders , and it has demonstrated its ability to spread via air travel , contrary to what has been seen in past outbreaks , " @entity15 said			2
" cases are occurring in rural areas which are difficult to access , but also in densely populated capital cities			0
" @entity106 : ebola vaccine to be tested in human trials soon @entity1 is coming to the @entity28 ? on thursday , a medical charter plane outfitted with an isolation pod left @entity111 , @entity112 , about 5 p.m. the aircraft was scheduled to fly to @entity80 , @entity33 , and will return with either dr. @entity114 or @entity115 , who were infected with @entity1 while working for the aid group @entity116 in @entity33 last week			1
the two patients will be evacuated in separate trips , according to @entity116 spokesman @entity119			1
it is unclear who will be transported first but both evacuations " should be completed by early next week			0
" @entity116 has described @entity114 and @entity115 as being in grave but stable condition			0
several aid organizations , including the @entity125 , are asking volunteers and nonessential personnel to leave the region			0
the evacuation of these staff members has begun , @entity116 said			0
who approved that ? the decision was ultimately that of @entity116 , @entity61 told @entity135 's dr. @entity134			0
the organization worked with the @entity31 to arrange the evacuation			0
" our role at @entity31 is to make sure in the transportation and in the care , any risk of infection to others is kept to the absolute minimum , " @entity61 said			0
" i know it creates a fear in people , but i really hope that people 's fear wo n't outweigh their compassion			0
" is the @entity31 ready to handle @entity1 ? trust in the @entity31 has waned in recent months , after multiple lapses in proper lab procedure put workers -- and potentially the public -- at risk			1
investigators found that scientists had transported dangerous biological materials in @entity162 bags and once sent a live sample of bird flu to a low - security lab ill - equipped to handle the virus			0
the investigation began in june , when workers based at the agency 's headquarters in @entity171 were potentially exposed to anthrax after a lab failed to deactivate it			0
@entity174 grilled @entity61 on july 16 over these and other incidents , saying they were " completely unacceptable			0
" " the @entity31 is supposed to be the gold standard " for lab safety , rep. @entity176 , @entity177 , said at the hearing			0
" this is not sound science , and this will not be tolerated			0
" which prompts the question : if the @entity31 was n't handling dangerous biological materials properly in a lab , is it ready to handle @entity28 's first @entity1 patient ? @entity61 said that in the past , five people have arrived in the @entity28 with other types of hemorrhagic fever ; in all five cases , the patients were treated in hospitals , and no secondary infections occurred			1
and @entity196 has treated infectious disease abroad for decades without a death , he said			0
" the stakes are higher with @entity1 , but the risk is no higher			1
it 's a virus easily deactivated with standard cleaning in hospitals			0
" experts : @entity28 health care system well - prepared for @entity1 when will the infected @entity28 be evacuated ? soon			1
the @entity29 said the two citizens would be evacuated in the " coming days			0
" when it arrives , the plane will land at @entity210 in @entity112 , about 20 miles from the @entity31 's @entity171 headquarters , a @entity208 spokesman said			1
then where will the patients go ? the patients will be brought to @entity216 , which is near @entity31 's headquarters , hospital officials told @entity134			1
they will likely be transported in an @entity216 ambulance or medical helicopter from the airport			2
@entity222 has a specially built isolation unit that is designed to treat patients exposed to infectious diseases like @entity1 , the hospital said in a statement thursday			1
it is one of only four units in the @entity28			1
" @entity222 physicians , nurses and staff are highly trained in the specific and unique protocols and procedures necessary to treat and care for this type of patient , " the statement said			0
" these procedures are practiced on a regular basis throughout the year so we are fully prepared for this type of situation			0
" what treatment will they receive ? there is no specific treatment for @entity1			1
doctors can administer only " supportive therapy , " which means supporting the patient 's own immune system as it tries to battle the infection			0
this usually involves intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and shock			0
this therapy for @entity1 patients could also include blood or platelet transfusions and oxygen therapy			1
@entity1 can last two to three weeks , so patients would remain in isolation until their symptoms subside and tests come back negative for the virus			1
should i be worried ? when the infected aid workers return , it will be the first time someone infected with @entity1 is known to have crossed into the @entity28			1
that realization has prompted fear among some on social media			0
but @entity28 health experts do n't seem concerned about it spreading for two reasons : one , @entity1 is aggressively infectious , which means that those infected are highly likely to get sick			1
but it 's not very contagious , meaning it does n't spread easily			0
it 's transmitted only through bodily fluids while the infected patient is exhibiting symptoms			2
and two , experts say our health care system would be able to identify and contain the virus swiftly			0
@entity61 said other aid workers returning to the @entity28 will have their temperature taken every day for 21 days -- the longest period known for @entity1 symptoms to appear after infection -- to ensure that they do n't have the virus			1
have other aid workers been affected ? yes			0
a well - known doctor fighting @entity1 in @entity42 died this week after contracting the virus			1
" to date , more than 60 health care workers have lost their lives in helping others			0
some international staff are infected , " @entity15 said			2
" these tragic infections and deaths significantly erode response capacity			0

@entity28 patients infected with @entity1 will be brought home in separate trips
medical plane will land at @entity210 in @entity112
ebola outbreak is " moving faster than our efforts to control it , " @entity7 leader says
