@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 says he 's just a good ol ' boy			1
he 's simple and plainspoken			2
but he has a painful past he ca n't leave behind			2
when he talks about it , the old emotions surface			2
@entity3 says he and others were abused at the @entity9 during the 1960s			1
@entity3 attended a @entity1 reform school as a teenager in the early 1960s			1
nearly half a century later , he 's telling a chilling tale of alleged beatings , sexual abuse and violent death at the hands of reform school workers			1
he said he believes the bodies of slain boys are buried in unnamed graves on the grounds of the former reform school in @entity23 , @entity1			1
" these men are animals and need to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law , " @entity3 told @entity2 in an interview at his attorney 's office in @entity0			1
@entity3 wore a black cowboy hat with a @entity33 logo			1
despite his tough exterior , he fought back tears as he recounted how he was physically and sexually assaulted			2
@entity3 is among a group of men , now in their 60s , who are suing state agencies in @entity1 as well as two former reform school workers over alleged abuse they received as teenagers			1
the suit was filed this month			2
" at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning , you 'd hear a boy crying , " @entity3 told @entity2			1
" and then the door would open and you 'd see these guys come in and come up to somebody they liked , and they 'd just tell you , ' come on with me , you 're mine for tonight			2
you 're my boy for tonight			2
' and they would take you and do what they wanted to do with you			2
" " they would take a leather strap , six inches wide and three feet long , " he added , swinging his arm in a downward motion			2
" it 's like a shotgun going off			2
and they beat you until you 're bloody			0
" @entity3 's attorneys said they 've interviewed 80 former students who say they were abused			1
@entity3 and the other alleged abuse victims who spoke with @entity2 all said the beatings took place in a small white cement building they called " the white house			1
" gov. @entity68 has ordered an investigation into the alleged abuse			1
he has asked the @entity71 to uncover records , interview students and find former administrators			0
the agency also was asked to determine who , if anyone , is buried beneath the 31 rusting white crosses on the school grounds			1
" whatever is below those crosses is crying out -- and it 's screaming for us to bring justice , " @entity3 said			1
the truth of what happened at the @entity9 may ultimately be lost to time			0
but investigators said they 're making progress			0
" there are challenges due to the length of time that has passed , " said @entity71 spokeswoman @entity89			0
" we are confident that we can conduct a thorough and methodical investigation and establish , as much as we can , what happened here and what lies beneath in those grave sites			1
" @entity89 said it was much too early in the investigation to say whether there would be an exhumation			2
investigators said that , so far , the search for records from 50 years ago has been productive			0
they also have met with many of the men who have come forward			0
when they meet with @entity3 , they will hear his claim that he witnessed the violent death of one boy who exposed himself to reform school workers on a dare			1
the boy was taken to " the white house			1
" @entity3 said that later , while he was working in the kitchen , he saw a brown 1949 @entity118 pull up			1
" they opened the back door and they carried him out and threw him in the back of the car , " said @entity3 , fighting tears			1
" they took him out there and buried him in the woods , " he said			0
" i know they buried him somewhere , ' cause he never showed up again			0
" investigators will also hear @entity3 's claim that he and many of the other boys were sexually assaulted			1
his story is so graphic that it can not be repeated			0
he tearfully apologized to @entity2			0
" i do n't pull no punches , but it 's hard doing this on camera			0
see what i 'm saying ? this is tough , fellas , " he said			0
" we 're all men here , know what i mean ? i 'm not ashamed of it , but i was 13 years old and i had no choice ... and it haunts me today			0
" @entity2 has tried to find many of the men who are alleged to have committed the beatings and sexual assaults			0

it alleges he participated in physical assaults and failed to report the abuse			1
@entity152 refused to meet with @entity2 in december to respond to the allegations , but he recently told the @entity159 that the boys were " spanked " but not injured			0
'' kids that were chronic cases , getting in trouble all the time , running away and what have you , they used that as a last resort , '' @entity152 told the @entity159			0
" we would take them to a little building near the dining room and spank the boys there when we felt it was necessary			0
" @entity152 , in his 80s , has hired a law firm to represent him in the lawsuit			2
in court filings , his lawyers are trying to get the suit thrown out			0
his attorney did not return @entity2 's calls for comment			0
" you 've got to realize what these guys did , " @entity3 said			1
" they mentally abused us , and they beat us			0
is that something you should say : ' i 'm sorry fellas			0
