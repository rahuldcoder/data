-- a decade after @entity5 emerged from devastating civil war , the sea front road that winds around the bay of its capital , @entity4 , is now dotted with multi-million dollar condominiums , exclusive clubs , and boutique stores catering for the country 's elite			2
most of @entity4 's population , however , live in the nearby slums , where health facilities are non-existent and children must work , not study , to survive			2
@entity18 's natural resource wealth has certainly fueled a decade of rapid growth , but most @entity18 have still not seen the benefits			1
more urgently , rapid population growth combined with deepening inequality could one day prove explosive			0
it does not have to be this way , of course			0
@entity25 successfully used its diamond wealth to develop quickly , growing from one of @entity18 's poorest countries at independence in 1966 to become a democratic , stable , and upper middle - income country			1
but countries such as @entity32 and @entity33 have also made impressive strides towards better natural resource management in recent years			0
with surging global demand keeping export prices high and new exploration revealing larger reserves than were previously known , @entity18 stands to reap a windfall from its natural resources			1
the challenge is to translate this wealth into meaningful benefit for @entity18 citizens			2
find out more : how @entity18 's resources fuel the world this year 's @entity47 , " equity in @entity49 : stewarding @entity18 's natural resources for all , " recommends policies so that more @entity18 can benefit from the minerals under their soil and coastal waters			1
among our recommendations for @entity18 policy makers , the international community , and the private sector , five major themes emerge			1
first , from revenue flows to company ownership , transparency is critical because it reduces the opportunity for corruption			0
international initiatives , such as the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) , have brought serious progress , and @entity18 governments such as @entity71 , @entity33 , and @entity32 are increasingly publishing contract details online			1
but there is still plenty of work to be done			0
the international community must do more to tackle the issues of money laundering and anonymous shell companies , which facilitate corruption by hiding the true recipients of corrupt payments			1
this is a global challenge which requires multilateral solutions			0
our report analyzed five recent deals , for example , which cost the @entity88 an estimated us $ 1.36 billion through the systematic undervaluation and sale of nationally owned mineral assets to unknown buyers			0
these losses were equal to more than double the combined 2012 budget for health and education in a country that has some of the world 's worst malnutrition , its sixth highest child mortality rate , and over seven million children out of school			0
read this : where is @entity5 's oil money ? these issues may have been on this year 's @entity108 political agenda , but @entity108 leaders did little to legislate against anonymous company ownership in their jurisdictions			0
the world will be watching @entity115 's @entity114 leadership next year for meaningful progress on this issue			0
second , @entity18 countries must secure a fairer share of natural resource revenues for their citizens			1
@entity18 has too often received an unfair return on its mineral resources			1
at the beginning of this century , for example , half a million @entity124 in the mining sector were paying a higher tax rate than the multinational companies they were working for			0
inevitably , some @entity18 governments have been at a natural disadvantage when negotiating with companies whose experience stretches over many decades and different continents too			2
but fairer deals can be good for multinationals			0
companies prefer a stable business environment and fairer deals tend to last much longer			0
third , @entity18 governments must spend their natural resource revenue more effectively on poverty reduction			1
between 2000 and 2011 , for example , @entity71 grew an average 17 percent per year , making it the fastest growing economy in the world and propelling it into the league of high - income countries			0
but three quarters of its population still live in poverty and its child mortality rates are among the highest in the world			0
by using resource flows to eliminate malnutrition , @entity18 policymakers could eliminate the greatest barrier to @entity18 's social and economic progress , which blights the lives of 40 percent of @entity18 's children			1
fourth , the international community must tackle tax avoidance and evasion , especially relevant for @entity18 's oil , gas , and mineral sectors			1
read this : @entity171 's biggest dam to light up @entity18 ? as we said in our report , @entity18 still loses more money each year through tax avoidance than it receives in either international aid or foreign direct investment			1
but the examples of @entity179 , @entity180 , and @entity181 show @entity108 policy agenda aligns with an @entity18 agenda too			2
throughout the world , governments and citizens will all benefit from tackling tax evasion and avoidance			1
fifth , @entity18 policy makers must grasp this opportunity to create more jobs			1
oil , gas , and mining do n't create large amounts of jobs per se , but job creation is a critical issue for @entity18 , which has one of the world 's fastest growing populations			1
governments must require extractive companies to procure more goods and services locally			0
but policy makers can also use extractive industries as a base for diversifying their economies			0
we are upbeat about @entity18 's prospects			1
not only do we see democracy taking root across the continent and much stronger economic governance , we also see more commitment from multinationals to contribute to society			0
ultimately , it is in all our interests that @entity18 succeeds			2
we all benefit from an @entity18 that is prosperous , fair , and stable			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity18 stands to reap a windfall from its resources , says @entity223 - @entity227
but most @entity18 have not benefited from continent 's resource - driven growth
@entity233 calls for transparency , fairer *distribution* of revenues , focus on jobs and poverty reduction
it also urges the international community to tackle tax avoidance and evasion
