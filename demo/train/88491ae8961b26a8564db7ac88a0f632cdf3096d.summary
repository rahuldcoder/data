-- imagine hurtling down a mountain at 60 miles an hour			0
now imagine doing it virtually blind			0
for @entity4 , it 's a thrilling reality			1
she might not quite reach the speeds of fully - sighted skiers -- @entity9 champions can clock upwards of 90 mph -- but it is nonetheless a daunting prospect			2
it involves a great deal of trust in her guide , @entity18 , a former skier herself who will play a key role in their chances of success at next month 's @entity24 in @entity25			1
" i do n't really have depth perception , so snow in particular is quite difficult , " @entity4 tells @entity0 's human to @entity27			1
" i definitely need @entity30 to be able to help me ski			0
" the 28 - year - old from @entity32 was born with oculocutaneous albinism , a condition that affects skin , hair and eyes			1
bright lights give her difficulties , forcing her to squint			0
" i grew up not really realizing the extent of my visual impairment , " she says			0
" i was always encouraged by my parents to do whatever i wanted to do and if i wanted rollerblades , my mum would reluctantly let me have them			0
" so although i know i have a visual impairment , it has n't really stopped me in too many ways -- other than i ca n't drive a car			2
" @entity4 was certainly a late bloomer when it came to skiing , only taking it up -- understandably with some trepidation -- as a 17 - year - old while on a family holiday in @entity55 , the tiny landlocked nation bordering @entity57 and @entity58			1
" i tried to convince the instructor that i could n't see anything , " she says			2
" he thought it was the bad visibility			0
" we just got on with it and had a go , and i 've never felt that sense of freedom or sense of joy from anything i 'd done , so it was something i really threw myself into when i was at university			0
" it 's a real joy and something i have n't found in another part of my life			2
ski racing and skiing at speed , it 's something that i 'm not able to do on a bike or on a car or on a horse			0
" i always have to give away that responsibility or that part of enjoyment to someone else			0
somebody else is always driving or i 'm not able to go fast on a bike or i 'm doing it in tandem , but with @entity30 skiing in front of me , i 'm doing it all my own and she 's just leading me			0
" @entity95 serves as @entity4 's eyes as they twist , turn and descend on tricky terrain			1
she guides @entity99 , who trails a few meters behind , down the course , as they communicate through microphones in their respective helmets			0
@entity4 tunes out the sound of the wind , spectators and looming helicopters , focusing solely on @entity95 ' voice			1
it 's then up to @entity4 to make adjustments as she 's warned about a difficult patch , told to " tuck " or , conversely , drop speed			1
call it a sort of leap of faith but also a study in quick reflexes			0
" @entity30 and i worked a lot off snow in order for us to have that foundation on snow , " @entity4 says , revealing that they saw a sports psychologist early on to help their partnership			1
if they ca n't communicate due to a breakdown in the audio equipment , @entity95 will -- and has -- stopped races			1
" safety first " is her mantra , though @entity4 admits she was n't averse to throwing caution to the wind earlier in her career			1
" there 's a confidence that comes with knowing @entity30 is in front of me , " said @entity4			1
" even if @entity30 is in difficulty , i am very confident skiing behind her			0
she would n't be bringing me into a situation where i would n't be able to cope with anything			2
" @entity95 is a former @entity146 champion who combined with @entity4 after a serious knee injury essentially ended her own competition hopes			1
by the time they met in november 2010 , @entity4 had already made history by becoming @entity32 's first @entity152 at the @entity153 earlier that year			1
when her guide -- another ex-racer named @entity156 -- later left , @entity4 was " desperate " to find someone else in order to continue her athletic career			1
in came @entity95 , who had snapped her cruciate ligament at the @entity161 but still harbored hopes of a comeback			1
" i was asked to do this and my first instinct was , ' i must be crazy			0
i ca n't have that responsibility			2
i do n't think i 'm ready for that , ' " @entity95 recalls			1
" it was actually my dad who was very much like , ' you have to just try			0
what 's the problem ? ' " i did			0
the plan was to go back but i made a lot better decision and i 'm now here four years later			0
" the two are like family now			0
even when on individual holidays , thoughts of the other are never far away			0
" we would talk about this thing called , ' mention-itis , ' " says the ever - bubbly @entity4			1
" whenever i go home , it takes me a good four to five days to stop being like , ' @entity30 thinks this ' or ' @entity30 does n't like to eat that			1
' " even on @entity30 's worst day , i would rather be with her than anyone else skiing			0
i find it a total delight to ski with her			0
" " awww ! " responds @entity95			1
there 's no doubt that the chemistry has led to fine results , so a medal or two in @entity25 -- the @entity24 begin on march 7 -- would n't come as a surprise			2
they plan to compete for @entity200 in all five alpine skiing events -- the downhill , super-g , super combined , giant slalom and slalom			0
the pair warmed up by winning a super combined race in @entity208 in january , and they grabbed two silver medals and two bronze medals at last year 's world championships in @entity213 , @entity57			2
" i think our hopes are just to ski as well as we can and stick to what we know and not try to change anything , " says @entity95			1
" it 'll be my first games			0
i 'm normally the confident one who says , ' we 're going to this race and we 're going to do this , ' but maybe @entity4 will be my help and bring me back to the base			1
" we ca n't wait to get on the big stage			2
" at some point @entity95 wants to finish her degree in sports science			1
as for @entity4 , she admits she 's nervous about returning to her job as a statistician -- because her " brain has really turned to mush " since immersing herself in skiing			2
for the time being , though , and with @entity95 ' assistance , the numbers might add up to success in @entity25 .			2

@entity4 and @entity18 will be competing at the @entity240
the skiers enter the @entity219 in good form , claiming top spot in a recent *super-combined* race
@entity4 is visually impaired and @entity95 became her guide after a serious knee injury
@entity4 says of her native @entity32 : " we have hills but we do n't have mountains . "
