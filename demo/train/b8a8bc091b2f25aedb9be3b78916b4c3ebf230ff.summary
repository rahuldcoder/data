it looks like @entity1 was just the beginning			2
@entity2 now appears to be aiming a few inches lower , working on a temporary electronic tattoo that would stick to the user 's throat			1
@entity2 - owned @entity6 has filed for a patent , published last week , for a system " that comprises an electronic skin tattoo capable of being applied to a throat region of a body			1
" the patent says the tattoo would communicate with smartphones , gaming devices , tablets and wearable tech like @entity1 via a @entity18 - style connection and would include a microphone and power source			1
the idea is that wearers could communicate with their devices via voice commands without having to wear an earpiece or the the @entity1 headset			2
and how 's this for future tech ? it could even be used as a lie detector			0
" optionally , the electronic skin tattoo can further include a galvanic skin response detector to detect skin resistance of a user , " the 10 - page document reads			0
" it is contemplated that a user that may be nervous or engaging in speaking falsehoods may exhibit different galvanic skin response than a more confident , truth telling individual			0
" " @entity48 " is a reference to the way some surfaces , even skin , conduct electricity			0
@entity2 explains mystery barge in images attached to the filing , the tattoo appears to be between a postage stamp and a @entity54 in size			1
the filing says that in addition to sticking via an adhesive to the throat , the tattoo could go on a collar or a band around the user 's neck			2
other possible uses include making both incoming and outgoing audio clearer			0
that could mean anything from making smartphone conversations clearer in a crowded room to being able to listen to music without earphones			0
and we ca n't quite figure out the use case for this one , but : " the electronic tattoo can also be applied to an animal as well			0
" digital tattoos and mind - reading headphones with @entity1 , the company has moved to be at the forefront of the rapidly emerging trend in wearable tech. glass is a wearable computer with a smartphone - like display that lets users text , browse the @entity89 , take photos and run other apps , all hands free			1
the latest version rolling out to field testers includes an ear bud , in response to complaints from some that the first version 's bone - conduction sound system did n't work well			2
it 's not hard to envision the throat tattoo as an eventual answer to that complaint			1
other wearable tech either on the market or the horizon includes smartwatches from @entity109 and @entity110 , with @entity2 , @entity111 and @entity112 expected to join the fray soon			1
a @entity6 spokesman said the company has no comment about the patent filing at this time			1
@entity118 faces backlash for @entity121 integration			0
