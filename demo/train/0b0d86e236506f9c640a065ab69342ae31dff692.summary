-- as you will be reminded countless times , when you cast your vote in tuesday 's presidential election , you 're not taking part in a nationwide popular vote , but rather helping decide who your state 's @entity8 delegates support			1
despite its name , the @entity8 never actually convenes as a unified group			1
there are all sorts of arguments for and against using this system rather than picking a winner based solely on the national popular vote , but for the moment , it looks like the @entity8 will be sticking around for a while			1
so what do you need to know about the least - fun college this side of the @entity26 's @entity25 ? what are the @entity8 's admissions policies ? different states choose their electors in different ways			1
some states have nominations for electors during party conventions , while others choose their electors in primaries			0
in @entity40 , the campaigns choose their own electors			0
the only real things that can disqualify you from being an elector are holding a federal office or having engaged in some sort of insurrection against the @entity49 government			0
chosen electors are generally loyal party members who can be counted on to cast a ballot that 's in line with their state 's popular vote			2
where 's the @entity8 's campus ? it does n't have one			1
although the name might make you think that all the electors meet in a centralized location to cast their ballots , the @entity8 never actually convenes as a unified group			2
instead , the chosen electors all meet at their respective state capitals on the first monday after the second wednesday in december to cast their votes			0
the votes are then counted in a joint session of @entity69 on january 6			0
what if no one gets a majority of the @entity8 's votes ? if no candidate can grab a majority ( currently 270 ) of the @entity8 's votes , the @entity73 meets immediately to pick the new president			1
in this situation , each state 's congressmen get together and pick a candidate among the top three vote getters in the @entity8 balloting			1
each state 's delegation then casts one vote			2
this process keeps going on indefinitely until a single candidate receives a majority of the states ' votes			2
the @entity73 has picked two presidents : @entity92 in 1800 and @entity93 in 1824			0
@entity0 : @entity93 vs. @entity92 : birth of negative campaigns since electors also ballots for vice president , the same situation can arise with that office			0
in these cases , the @entity101 immediately goes into session to pick a vice president , although each senator has his own vote			2
the @entity101 votes until a candidate receives a majority of the cast votes			2
this sort of contingent election has happened just once			0
in 1836 @entity114 @entity113 's running mate , @entity112 needed 148 votes to win the @entity116 , but @entity118 's electors refused to vote for him			1
as a result , he ended up stuck with 147 votes , and the @entity101 had to hold a contingent election , where @entity112 cruised by @entity123 candidate @entity122			2
can the electors change their mind ? they can , but they then become what are known as " faithless electors			0
" technically , states make their electors pledge to vote in a certain way , and 24 states have laws that punish electors who decide to get cute and switch things up			0
however , with a few exceptions like @entity138 and @entity139 , votes cast by faithless electors still count in the final tally			0
yeah , but that never happens , does it ? @entity143 electors have actually popped up fairly frequently in @entity49 electoral history			0
one notable instance of faithless electors rearing their head occurred in 1972			0
@entity147 , the treasurer of the @entity148 of @entity118 , was a pledged elector for @entity149 and @entity150			2
instead , he cast his ballot for the @entity153 ticket			2
while this vote put him firmly on the outs with the state @entity148 , he became something of a @entity153 folk hero			1
in fact , @entity159 were so enthused by his vote that he won the party 's presidential nomination in the 1976 election			1
although most switcheroos do n't benefit small - party candidates like this one did , they 're not all that uncommon , and not a recent trend , either ; @entity170 's winning total in the 1860 election included four electors who were pledged to @entity173			1
although @entity174 won sound victories in 1980 and 1984 , he also received a single electoral vote in 1976			1
@entity177 , a faithless elector from @entity178 , cast his vote for @entity174 instead of @entity179 , as he 'd pledged			0
@entity0 : brief history of endorsements it 's winner - take - all for each state , right ? yes , for most states , the winner of the popular vote gets all of the state 's electors			1
however , @entity190 and @entity191 allocate their electors a little differently			0
because each seat in @entity69 is roughly analogous to one vote in the @entity8 , these states let each congressional district pick its own candidate			1
the state 's remaining two electoral votes , which correspond to the state 's two senators , go to whichever candidate wins the popular vote within the state			1
technically , this system could result in a state 's electoral votes being split between two candidates			1
in practice , though , all of the districts tend to vote the same way			0
although @entity190 and @entity191 have been using this system since 1972 and 1992 , respectively , neither state has ever split its presidential votes			2
what happens if a president - elect dies ? the national election takes place tuesday , but the @entity8 wo n't formally meet to cast their votes until december 15			1
if a candidate dies or becomes otherwise unfit to take office in the interim , a thorny issue pops up			0
some states , like @entity118 , legally bind their electors to vote for the candidate whose name was on the general election ballot			0
other states , though , are more flexible and would allow their electors to vote for the ticket 's vice-presidential candidate or other agreed - upon candidate			1
luckily , this scenario has never happened with an election winner			0
in 1872 , though , democrat @entity236 died just over three weeks after @entity237 thumped him in the election			0
because the @entity8 still had to meet to elect @entity237 , electors who would have voted for @entity236 simply spread their 66 votes among other @entity242 candidates			1
as a result , @entity243 actually came in second in the election with 42 electoral votes despite not campaigning for the presidency ; he was busy successfully running for @entity249			1
three electors actually voted for @entity236 even though he was dead , which probably tells you all you need to know about the health of the @entity242 during @entity254			0
@entity0 : snl political quiz if the president elect dies after the @entity8 's voting but before the inauguration , the @entity256 states that the vice president elect becomes president			1
