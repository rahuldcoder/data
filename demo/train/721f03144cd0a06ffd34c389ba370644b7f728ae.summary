@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity4 stepped into the floodwaters last week , history washed over him			1
thirty years after his father drowned in a rescue attempt , @entity4 helped save a woman whose car sank			1
the youngest of five children , he was only 8 when his father died			1
for three decades , he 'd carried with him mere snapshots of memories : family time at @entity15			2
riding on the back of @entity18 's motorcycle			1
@entity20 's love for drag - racing			1
but as the 37 - year - old @entity23 , @entity1 , man set out september 22 to try and save a woman whose car was swept away by rushing waters , he thought of his father 's drowning			1
he , too , had fought to rescue people struggling against currents			1
@entity20 , a @entity32 of @entity33 employee , dove into the @entity34 in @entity33 , @entity1 , to save canoeists who 'd flipped their boat , his son said			1
he safely brought two to shore			2
the third , he said , panicked -- forcing them both under			2
it would be a week before his father 's body was found			1
dying in the massive floodwaters could n't be @entity4 's fate			1
it was his mother @entity45 's 72nd birthday			1
lord knows she did n't deserve news like that			2
' all in a blink of an eye ' @entity51 was heading east en route to @entity53 , @entity1 , for an important morning meeting with her boss			1
she does n't know why , but it simply did n't register with the @entity23 woman that she was the only one traveling along that stretch of @entity59			1
no signs or barriers told her she should n't be there			2
the water up ahead ? it simply looked like a puddle , albeit a big one , the kind that would send a huge spray flying			2
" i got halfway through it , and it took control of my car			1
it started taking me backwards -- all in a blink of an eye , " she said tuesday			1
" i knew i was in serious trouble			2
" the @entity33 - area terminal for @entity80 , a large trucking company off @entity59 on @entity78 , was abuzz that morning			1
floodwater from nearby @entity82 had taken over a large swathe of the property , worse than they had ever seen			0
nearly 30 mechanics had scrambled down to the lower lot to move about 100 semis , the water topping their tires			1
some guys , including @entity4 , a shop foreman who 's been with @entity92 for nearly 19 years , looked out in wonder at the green space next to the lot , which had turned into a wide moving river			1
when they first saw the silver @entity96 coming through the trees from the interstate , they laughed , thinking it had been carried out of someone 's driveway			1
but after it hit a submerged fence and spun around , they spotted @entity105 , 40 , frantically waving			0
" my eyes zoomed in to see her fear , " said @entity4			0
and as the car started to go under , he thought , " this woman is going to drown in front of us			1
" taking charge @entity105 thought back to the movies she 'd seen , kept the car running and hit the power button to lower the window before it was too late			1
she was a good swimmer , she knew that much , and with this knowledge -- and purse in hand , of course , she would recall with a laugh -- @entity105 pushed herself into the torrent			0
the current , however , was stronger than she was			0
it pulled her where it wanted			0
she grabbed on to what appeared to be a small tree			0
" hold on ! hold on ! " @entity105 heard their voices and held herself together			1
she was n't crying , but she was scared for her life			0
the tree branches began breaking			0
@entity4 had taken off running , back up to the parts room to grab a spool of 1,000 - foot yellow nylon rope , the sort used to tie tarps over flatbeds			1
he threw on a fluorescent safety vest , so the men on shore could easily spot him in the filthy water			0
bigger men , including 265 - pound @entity149 , were ready to jump into the water			0
but @entity4 , 100 pounds lighter , was laying out a plan in his head			0
pulling him out would be easier , he told the men			0
why make the job harder with a heavier man ? " he took charge like he 'd done this a hundred times , " @entity149 , 24 , said			1
maybe it was his training in the @entity158 after high school or his father 's experience , but keeping everyone calm , warding off panic , was top of @entity4 's mind			1
more than 25 men stationed themselves on two points around the water as he waded in , and fed out the rope tied around him			2
he worked his way along the 6 - foot - high , nearly submerged fence topped with barbed wire , struggling against the current to get close to @entity105 , whose car had jumped the fence			2
the depth of the water worried him			0
weeds tugged at his feet and legs			0
" ' what 's your name ? ' " @entity105 remembered him asking calmly , his eyes locked on hers			2
then , he said , " ' @entity51 , everything 's going to be ok			2
' and i believed him			0
" she called @entity4 the " leader of the pack , " and remembered him shouting to the others , " guys , let 's pull this together			2
if we do n't pull this together , we 're going to lose her			0
" on the other side of the fence was a stranger , @entity195			0
that morning , he 'd been checking out the damage to his neighborhood when he came upon the mess abutting @entity80			0
@entity195 , 45 , was now in the water as well			0
with a rope in his hand , unknowingly fed to him by @entity4 's team , he snatched @entity105 from the tree			1
it was n't until @entity4 was out of the water that he knew , for certain , that he and @entity105 had made it			0
the ' what ifs ' the first call was to his wife , @entity208 , the mother of his three children			2
she did n't believe him when he told her what had happened			0
" @entity59 kid you not , " he told her			1
" you want to smell me ? " he took a shower at work , scrubbed every inch of himself with a whole bottle of @entity218 and joked that he was surprised his hair did n't turn white			0
he showered again , stepped into spare clothes and put in a full day on the job			0
it would be at least a few hours before he could call his mother			0
he knew she might get upset			0
a week later , the death toll in @entity1 from the floods was 10			1
standing along the fence still tangled with weeds and debris , @entity4 peered down at @entity105 ' mucked - up car , knowing that number could have been higher			2
" it could 've happened to me the same way it did my dad , " he said			0
the " what ifs " keep spinning through his head : what if her window had n't been down ? what if they 'd never spotted her ? what if she 'd failed to stay calm ? mixed in are thoughts about his father , a man he in many ways struggles to remember			1
what @entity4 did was not unlike the countless heroic efforts that played out in disaster areas during the flood			2
first responders and regular citizens risked their own lives to save others			0
but he had something else pushing him , the kind of inspiration rooted in family legacy			0
and without a doubt , @entity20 would have been proud of his boy .			0

man enters flood to rescue woman , 30 years after father drowned saving others
woman 's car washes off @entity59 in @entity1 , ' in a blink of an eye , ' she says
*co-workers* hold rope while he goes in , trying to keep everyone calm
thoughts of his father and the ' what ifs ' stay with him
