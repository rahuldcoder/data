-- remember your first road trip ? that sweet taste of independence as you were finally unleashed on @entity7 's free and open highways ? for @entity10 - winning automotive columnist @entity9 , it was the day he turned 16 and passed his driving test			1
" the minute i got my drivers license out of the laminator , i was on the road , " he recalled			2
" i took the longest road trip i could take			2
" @entity9 pointed his @entity17 convertible in the direction of the nearest city : @entity20 , @entity21			0
" i just had to go man , i just had to drive			0
i must have put 500 miles on that car that day			0
" @entity9 said he was part of a mindset that associated the automobile with freedom , mobility and self - determination			2
then the excitement in @entity9 's voice disappeared			0
" that was in the mid- 1970s , and the road system was a little bit different then			2
the days of @entity7 's " free " and open roads are gone -- or perhaps they never existed at all			1
drivers often forget that they pay for highway construction and maintenance through federal fuel taxes : 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel			2
" the notion that the road has ever been free is sort of a self - delusion , " said @entity9			1
opinion : five myths about the highway fuel tax but the fuel tax is running out of steam , experts warn , because more efficient vehicles are using less fuel and rising fuel prices discourage driving			1
as tax revenue falls , so does the nation 's ability to pay for road construction and maintenance			1
the solution , say many transportation experts , is to replace -- or supplement -- fuel taxes with a per - mile tax on every vehicle in @entity7			1
tax authorities might monitor each vehicle 's mileage by installing devices that would transmit data			1
unlike a fuel tax , which is somewhat hidden in the price of fuel , a device that spends your money with each tick of the odometer would be a real buzz - kill for millions of road tripping @entity7			1
" it 's just like a speed limit or a toll road or any other kind of interference , " said @entity9			2
" it steps on that conception we have of ourselves as a people without borders or boundaries			0
you step on our ability to take to the open road			1
" the bottom line so , what kind of money are we talking about here ? translated into dollars and cents , fuel taxes cost each vehicle owner about $ 250 a year on average			2
according to a @entity105 study , paying that amount on a per - mile basis would come to about 1.6 cents per mile			1
whether it is paid for through fuel taxes or taxing per - mile , it 's clear the federal highway fund is in trouble			1
by the end of 2012 , according to the @entity116 , the fund will " be unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner " unless @entity118 injects even more life support from the general @entity120			0
during the next 20 years , projections show average vehicle fuel efficiency nearly doubling			2
revenues from the fuel tax will be slashed by half , according to the @entity105 study			1
meanwhile , the cost of safe roads , bridges and transit systems will skyrocket			0
by 2020 , says the @entity131 , the price tag could be as high as $ 1.7 trillion			0
bottom line : two cents per mile would be enough to pay for the nation 's transportation infrastructure needs			2
that 's according to a 2009 nonpartisan commission headed by two former @entity7 transportation secretaries			1
' the man , ' with a capital m imagine 254 million vehicles			0
that 's the number of cars , trucks and motorcycles that a tax per mile system would have to monitor			1
some proposals call for using gps satellites to gather mileage data on each vehicle			2
really ? when it comes to tracking their vehicles , @entity7 tend to be really touchy about protecting their privacy			1
according to a @entity105 poll , only about 20 % of drivers would choose a pay - per - mile tax system if gps tracking is involved			1
the anonymous driver will soon be an extinct species , says @entity9			0
" you ca n't drop off the grid			2
ten years from now , it will be virtually impossible to drive a car that does n't have an electronic signature , " said @entity9			2
" it does n't matter whether you have @entity168 or you rent a car -- it 's going to have a ' black box			2
' if you 've got any kind of navigation , the man -- with a capital m -- knows where you are			0
" @entity105 research shows that the public would be more willing to accept per - mile taxes if its monitoring technology does n't record a vehicle 's specific location			1
taking your vehicle to have someone read the odometer every year -- like some states do with emissions testing -- might be an option			0
but some experts fear that method might be too expensive			0
also , the resulting once - a - year tax bill might be too much for some drivers to pay			1
one idea tested in @entity195 eliminates gps and uses cell phone text messaging technology			0
during fuel stops at gas stations , a device that already exists in most cars would text the car 's mileage information to a " back office " data base			0
the office would then adjust the price of fuel at the pump based on each vehicle 's mileage driven			0
implementing any system would be tricky , says @entity213 , who headed the @entity105 study			0
retrofitting existing cars with the required technology would be almost impossible , he says			0
the cheapest and least difficult option says @entity218 , would be to install devices in new cars and slowly transition to the new system as the nation 's entire fleet of vehicles turns over			0
it takes about eight years before 90 % of our vehicles are turned over , @entity213 says , and more than 10 years to convert the fleet to nearly 100 %			0
" it 's inevitable , " says @entity213 , who 's been conducting a real - world test of a pay - per - mile system with more than 2,500 drivers in 12 locations from coast - to - coast			1
per - mile taxes " with a combination of tolls is coming as we move away from the fuel tax			1
" several states in addition to @entity105 and @entity195 are looking into possible pay - per - mile tax systems , including @entity243 and @entity244			1
do n't bother , some argue leave well - enough alone , says the @entity247 ' @entity246 , who argues that taxing vehicles per mile is too expensive to implement and administer			1
those costs would be passed on to consumers , @entity246 says			0
the best and least complicated solution is to raise the fuel tax , which has n't changed since 1993			1
but that idea comes with its own set of political challenges			0
many members of @entity118 would likely oppose any kind of tax hike			0
" i 'm not convinced per - mile taxes are going to happen , " says @entity246			1
" if it does , it probably wo n't happen for a long time			0
" despite all the changes technology may bring to the driving experience , " the @entity7 road will still be out there , " says @entity9			1
" it 's fun and it 's incredibly broadening for people ... and it 's a great way to spend time with your family , " he says			0
" it might not be as innocent as it used to be , but it 's still an important part of who we are as a people			0
" how to pay for that highway remains a question @entity7 will debate for a while -- perhaps for years down the road .			1

experts : per - mile road tax will replace or supplement fuel tax
columnist : do n't *curtail* @entity7 ' love for the open road
