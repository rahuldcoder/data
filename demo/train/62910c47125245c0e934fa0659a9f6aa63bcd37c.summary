@entity0 beheaded another @entity1 , a @entity2 aid worker			1
@entity4 secretary of state @entity3 courted @entity6 leaders to join a coalition in the fight against the @entity10 militants			2
and @entity4 planes aimed at @entity0 fighters near @entity14 's capital			1
as world leaders struggled monday to come up with strategies against @entity0 just days after a high - profile beheading by the @entity10 militants , the @entity4 military targeted an @entity0 position near @entity20			1
an airstrike southwest of the city appears to be the closest the @entity4 airstrikes have come to the @entity14 capital since the start of the campaign against the @entity10 militants , a senior @entity4 military official told @entity29			1
a statement from @entity31 described the action as " the first strike taken as part of our expanded efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions to hit ( @entity0 ) targets as @entity14 forces go on offense , as outlined in the president 's speech last wednesday			1
" an isis " fighting position " that was firing on @entity14 security forces southwest of @entity20 was destroyed , the statement said			2
meanwhile , more than two dozen nations , the @entity48 , the @entity49 and @entity50 met in the @entity52 capital , calling @entity0 a threat to the international community and agreeing to " ensure that the culprits are brought to justice			1
" in a statement at the conference 's conclusion , the @entity52 government said the participants had agreed to take on @entity0 " by any means necessary , including appropriate military assistance , in line with the needs expressed by the @entity14 authorities , in accordance with international law and without jeopardizing civilian security			1
" @entity52 president @entity69 , who hosted the conference with his @entity14 counterpart , @entity71 , said there was " no time to lose " in international efforts against @entity0			1
meanwhile , the leader of @entity14 's @entity75 asked for intensified @entity4 airstrikes , saying he would welcome foreign fighters and urging @entity78 and the @entity4 to set aside their differences to fight @entity0			1
latest beheading @entity0 , which calls itself the @entity80 , underlined its barbaric credentials over the weekend -- posting a video showing the beheading of @entity2 aid worker @entity84 and threatening the life of another hostage from the @entity2			1
it was the third videotaped killing of a @entity89 hostage released in less than a month			0
the latest killing , @entity0 said , was " a message to the allies of @entity4 " -- a direct challenge to the @entity4			2
president @entity94 announced last week that the @entity4 would lead " a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat " and that @entity4 airstrikes against @entity0 would expand from @entity14 into @entity96			1
the @entity4 has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against @entity0 , which has seized control of large areas of northern @entity14 and @entity96			1
but it remains unclear exactly which countries are on that list and what roles they 'll play			0
@entity2 wo n't ' shirk our responsibility ' @entity2 's role in the coalition is in particular focus after the killing of @entity84 , who was abducted last year near a @entity96 refugee camp where he was working			1
@entity84 ' death " will not lead @entity2 to shirk our responsibility " to work with allies to take on @entity0 , @entity2 prime minister @entity116 said sunday			2
instead , he said , " it must strengthen our resolve			0
" @entity116 pledged to work with the @entity4 to support its " direct military action			0
" he also emphasized that " this is not about @entity2 troops on the ground			0
" killer identified ? @entity116 has vowed to " hunt down those responsible " for @entity84 ' killing and " bring them to justice , no matter how long it takes			0
" the situation is made all the more difficult by the fact that the man who appears in the video beheading @entity84 -- believed to be the same man previously shown killing @entity4 journalists @entity136 and @entity138 -- has a @entity140 accent			2
@entity116 knows the identity of the killer , @entity29 national security analyst @entity141 has reported , citing unidentified @entity2 officials			0
but authorities are n't making it public for " operational reasons , " @entity141 writes in a commentary for @entity29			0
@entity116 knows that the man in the video holds at least two other @entity4 citizens as well as other hostages from additional @entity89 countries , and that he is part of a larger group of @entity2 hostage - takers working for @entity0 , @entity141 reports			1
" it is a real crisis for @entity116 , and it underlines a sobering fact : @entity2 citizens have volunteered to go to @entity96 to fight at 25 times the rate that @entity4 have done so , when adjusted for population size , " he writes			1
building a coalition @entity3 , who attended the @entity165 conference monday , closed out a @entity6 trip on saturday , seeking to win support for the @entity4 - led @entity169 coalition			0
in an interview that aired sunday on @entity172 ' " @entity171 , " @entity3 said some nations " are clearly prepared to take action in the air alongside the @entity4 and to do airstrikes , if that 's what they 're called on to do , " but he did not get more specific			1
@entity2 has agreed to help arm @entity181 forces , support the @entity14 government , keep supplying humanitarian help and coordinate with the @entity50 to battle @entity0			1
@entity52 , meanwhile , began reconnaissance flights over @entity14 , the @entity184 said			0
two @entity188 air force planes took off from a base in the @entity190 , it said			0
some nations have also offered to commit ground troops , but " we are not looking for that at this moment anyway , " @entity3 said in the @entity172 interview			0
@entity14 @entity75 's president @entity195 -- whose @entity197 forces have taken a significant role in battling @entity0 -- told @entity29 's @entity199 on monday that he has not asked for foreign fighters but would welcome them			1
he also called on the @entity4 to step up airstrikes and said @entity78 should play a role in battling @entity0			1
but that can only happen , he said , if @entity78 and the @entity4 " put their differences aside			0
" @entity78 has rejected any cooperation with the @entity4 to combat @entity0 in @entity14 , supreme leader @entity206 said on his @entity209 account monday			1
" i rejected ( the ) @entity4 offer to @entity78 about @entity0 , because @entity4 has corrupted its hands in this issue , " the statement read			2
@entity214 accused the @entity4 of planning to use military action against @entity0 to " dominate the region			2
" analyst : @entity94 ' revealed too much ' a leading @entity14 expert on @entity0 told @entity29 that @entity94 may already have revealed more about @entity4 plans than he should have to the militant group 's leader , @entity220			1
" the mistake was announcing too much of the strategy , and this was a free gift to @entity229 to prepare and counter what has been revealed , " said @entity222 , who has studied jihadist groups and their evolution in @entity14 over the past decade			0
he suggested @entity0 has already begun to take defensive measures , including moving weapons and ammunition into depots and putting elite fighters among civilian populations to avoid airstrikes			2
the @entity169 alliance that the @entity4 is putting together risks driving more terrorist organizations to join forces with @entity229 's group in what they perceive as a " crusader " war against @entity244 , @entity222 said			2
' fighting ideology with ideology ' influential @entity6 countries such as @entity249 and @entity250 may be crucial in countering that view			0
" help is needed from @entity250 and @entity249 religious scholars in fighting ideology with ideology , " @entity222 said			0
" this is key to extracting @entity0 from the roots			0
" last week , @entity249 's grand mufti reportedly condemned @entity0 , saying that its actions are not in line with @entity259			2
a member of the @entity250 royal family told @entity29 on monday that he did n't think his country would participate in military operations but would be pleased to see @entity0 vanquished in response to its heinous violence			0
" i think that with each killing that takes place , unfortunately , every time hopefully the world community will be more united in really eradicating this disease that 's really infecting the whole @entity6 region and inevitably will be contagious to other countries in the world , " prince @entity266 said			0
if @entity94 sticks to the goal of defeating the @entity10 extremists , the move will help restore @entity250 's trust in @entity278 , which has been shaken over the crisis in @entity96 , he said			0
@entity280 said he is concerned by the exclusion of @entity78 -- arguably the most influential player in @entity14 -- from the coalition			0
" they sidelined @entity78 , and that is a very big mistake because @entity78 controls the @entity288 militias in @entity14 and these militias could sabotage military operations when it comes to logistical support or can threaten the safety of @entity4 advisers and trainers , " he said			2
how many more @entity89 captives is @entity0 holding ?			0
