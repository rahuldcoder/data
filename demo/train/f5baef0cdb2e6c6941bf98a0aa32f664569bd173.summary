-- in some ways , it 's not surprising that @entity3 were happy to vote @entity4 back into the presidency in 2012			1
after all , the economy grew by an average of 7 % from @entity4 's emergence in 1999 as a national politician , through his first two terms as president until may 2008 , while real incomes more than doubled			1
pensions were paid , and @entity4 had been able to brag in his last annual address to the @entity19 that " not only has @entity3 now made a full turnaround after years of industrial decline , it has become one of the world 's ten biggest economies			1
" it may have been @entity4 's bellicose rhetoric and shirtless photo opportunities that grabbed headlines overseas , but the fact is , his popularity was fundamentally based on the perception of growing prosperity for @entity3 citizens			1
the problem for @entity4 now is that the remarkably felicitous combination of economic factors that fueled his popularity for so long seems to be crumbling around him			1
tumbling oil prices have been one factor			1
oil production increased 50 % from 1999 to 2004 , providing a real boon to the country 's coffers as the oil price soared to a peak of over $ 140 a barrel in july 2008 ( compared with about half that today )			1
but even while macroeconomic indicators remained robust , there was a consensus among analysts that the previous drivers of @entity3 economic growth were exhausted , and that the government needed to return to a reform agenda to improve the investment environment , reduce red tape , and curb corruption , among other measures			0
unfortunately , since returning to the presidency , @entity4 and his administration have disregarded this advice			1
for those of us who studied the @entity65 experience in the early 1980s , a period when economic growth was near zero despite a massive windfall of petro - dollars , it started to feel like deja vu all over again			0
indeed , by early 2014 , even before the annexation of @entity69 , there were clear signs of further economic deterioration as the ruble fell by 10 % and first quarter capital outflows ballooned to a record rate of $ 50 billion			2
but over the summer and into the fall , the imposition of serious @entity77 sanctions over @entity3 aggression in @entity79 and a more than 30 % drop in the oil price have combined to suggest that a perfect storm is finally brewing that may make @entity4 's first near - decade in power look like a distant and fond memory			1
just as earlier @entity3 leaders @entity89 and @entity90 ended up unpopular mainly as a result of economic deprivation , a prolonged economic downturn in @entity3 would deeply erode the current wave of popularity that @entity4 is riding after the euphoria of annexing @entity69			1
the danger to his presidency was underscored as he delivered an aggressive and defiant @entity98 address this past week warning about unnamed enemies ( although the @entity100 and @entity101 were the implied targets ) seeking to weaken @entity3			0
the rhetoric seemed flat , especially so when juxtaposed with the wave of bad economic news and the fact that he chose not to seriously discuss the challenges the country is facing			0
how bad have things gotten ? in the past week , the @entity111 downgraded expectations of 1.2 % growth in 2015 to a contraction of 0.8 %			0
meanwhile , the ruble has lost more than 50 % of its value since the beginning of the year , despite the @entity118 spending more than $ 70 billion to defend it			0
in fact , by the middle of last month , @entity3 reserves were $ 103 billion less than at the beginning of the year			0
worse , the @entity111 's estimates could actually look optimistic a year from now , as they are based on an $ 80 per barrel oil price			2
given the recent growth in production , including @entity100 shale oil , the oil price could easily fall further and remain low			2
since revenues from oil and gas exports make up about half of the @entity3 federal budget , @entity135 's capacity to meet existing social welfare obligations -- let alone plans for expanded defense spending -- will be curtailed			1
( and this does not even account for the increased costs to @entity135 related to the annexation of @entity69 and its activities in @entity79 , where a large - scale humanitarian catastrophe is developing as winter sets in			0
) there are already ominous signs of potential social unrest			1
protesters marched in 40 cities across @entity3 last month over planned reductions in health care spending in 2015 of up to 20 %			0
on december 2 , @entity4 announced a freeze on government salaries that , in the context of an inflation rate of more than 8 % , will see many facing a significant drop in their salaries			2
almost a decade ago , i wrote that @entity4 was very lucky to emerge at a time of such positive economic conditions , many of which lay beyond his control			2
the situation today , however , is not so much that luck has turned against him , but that he has failed to address structural weaknesses in the @entity3 economy even as he conducts a not - so - covert war against his neighbor			0
when @entity4 returned to the presidency in 2012 , most @entity3 and outside observers seemed resigned to at least another 12 years of his leadership , through 2024			2
but as things stand , not only do recent events call his re-election in 2018 into question , but if economic decline continues , the @entity179 elections scheduled for 2016 could shake the system			0
any student of @entity3 history knows that @entity3 's path is frequently disrupted by nonlinear events , and today it appears increasingly possible that another could happen even in the next few years			0
if it does , @entity4 will end up lying on the dust heap of history			2
it could n't happen to a nicer guy .			0
