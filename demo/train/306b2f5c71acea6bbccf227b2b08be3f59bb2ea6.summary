-- emergency contraception known as the " morning - after pill " can be sold over-the - counter to minors , a federal appeals court in @entity6 decided on wednesday			1
a generic two - pill version could soon be available without a prescription or any age restrictions , according to an order by the @entity11			1
but the three - judge panel separately blocked unrestricted sales of a newer , different @entity15 one - pill version , until it can further consider the matter			1
the @entity18 administration has been criticized by some women 's rights groups for trying to stop contraception sales to underage females			1
some of those groups applauded the court 's order			2
" once again , the message from the courts is clear : emergency contraception must be made available over the counter for all ages , and the burdensome practice of requiring girls 16 and under to obtain a prescription and all others to show an @entity36 must end , " said @entity30 , co-president of the @entity31			2
the @entity37 appealed a ruling in april by @entity40 district judge @entity39 , who directed the @entity41 to make the morning - after birth control pill available to females " of child - bearing age " without a prescription			1
the key ingredient in @entity15 is the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel , which can prevent fertilization or prevent an egg from embedding in the uterus if it has been fertilized			0
@entity39 's ruling responded to a lawsuit launched by the @entity54			0
the group sought to expand access to all brands of the morning - after pill over the counter , such as @entity15 one - step and @entity61 , so that females of all ages would be able to purchase them without a prescription			2
supporters of the district court ruling called it a landmark decision , while opponents raised concerns about safeguards being eliminated			0
the government now has 14 days to decide whether to challenge the order before the full appeals court or directly to the @entity40 @entity75			1
if the order is not appealed , reproductive rights groups say the two - pill contraceptive could be available at pharmacies in about a month			1
plan b one - step is an updated one - pill version			2
the @entity41 said last month it was changing its regulations , allowing sales by a private pharmaceutical firm , @entity84 , to those 15 and over without a prescription			2
only those 17 or older were previously allowed to buy the contraceptive			0
@entity39 had criticized what he called " nonsensical " government rules that he said unfairly favored the single pill version over the cheaper , generic two - pill version			1
under current policies , prescriptions are still need for the generic version for those under age 17			0
the @entity41 announced two years ago there would be no limits on over-the - counter sales of morning - after pills			1
but @entity102 secretary @entity101 unilaterally ordered the age and prescription restrictions put in place			0
emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours			0
many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives , including @entity114 and most of @entity115 , but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally			0
there was no immediate reaction to the order from the @entity41 or the @entity37			0
the case is @entity123 v. @entity124 ( 13 - 1690 ) .			0
