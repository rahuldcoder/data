@entity0 -- a bill that offers a path to citizenship to some illegal immigrants who entered the @entity6 as children failed a procedural vote in the @entity9 on saturday			1
known formally as the @entity11 , the @entity10 fell five votes short of the 60 needed to be considered for final passage			1
the measure passed in the @entity15 earlier this month by a vote of 216 - 198			1
in a statement released shortly after the vote , president @entity17 called it " an incredibly disappointing vote			1
" " a minority of senators prevented the @entity9 from doing what most @entity6 understand is best for the country			1
there was simply no reason not to pass this important legislation , " @entity17 said in a statement			1
" it is disappointing that common sense did not prevail today			2
" the president vowed to continue to fight for the legislation , which would offer legal standing to immigrants who entered the @entity6 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the country for at least five years			1
other requirements include graduating from high school or obtaining a general education development diploma and demonstrating " good moral character			2
" even then , only a six - year conditional status would be awarded			0
before moving to the next phase , the students would need to meet additional requirements -- attending college or serving in the military for at least two years , and passing criminal background checks			0
proponents , such as @entity17 and @entity51 leaders , say the bill would give legal standing to young people brought to the @entity6 who have bettered themselves and served their new country			1
@entity51 senators lined up saturday to excoriate their @entity59 colleagues and assure @entity61 supporters they wo n't give up on the legislation			0
several made reference to busloads of @entity66 students who drove all night from @entity67 to witness the vote			0
" @entity6 is a country where dreams are made , not crushed			1
and today dreams were crushed , " @entity6 sen. @entity70 ( @entity71 ) said			2
" my message to these young people is ' never fear , ' we 're not going anywhere			0
we 're going to continue to fight because this is the right thing to do			0
" republicans , such as sen. @entity79 of @entity80 , called the measure an amnesty on saturday before the vote to invoke cloture -- which would end or limit debate			2
" if we pass this amnesty , we will signal to the world that we 're not serious about the enforcement of our laws or our borders , " @entity79 said			0
" it will say , you make plans -- you can make plans to bring in your brother , your sister , your cousin , your nephew , your friend , into the country illegally as a teenager , and there will be no principled reason in the future for the next congress then sitting to not pass another " dream " act			0
and it will only be a matter of time before that next group illegally here will make the same heartfelt pleas that we hear today			0
" republicans who voted to advance the bill were sens. @entity114 of @entity115 , @entity116 of @entity117 and @entity118 of @entity119			2
democrats against it included @entity122 and @entity123 of @entity124 , @entity125 of @entity126 , @entity127 of @entity128 , and @entity129 of @entity130 .			0
