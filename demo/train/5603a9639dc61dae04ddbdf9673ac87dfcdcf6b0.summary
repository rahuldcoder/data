@entity0 -- levels of radioactive iodine in seawater just offshore of the embattled @entity9 nuclear plant spiked to more than 1,250 times higher than normal , @entity4 's nuclear and industrial safety agency said saturday			1
samples taken friday morning from a monitoring station 330 meters off the coast were significantly higher than results from the previous morning , when the level was 104 times above normal			0
the measurements also showed high levels of cesium and were taken outside the discharge canal for the plant 's @entity20 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 reactors			1
readings from a short distance away , outside the @entity20 5 and 6 units ' discharge canal , showed lower but still high radioactive iodine levels some 284 times above normal			1
these high levels suggest there may have been some sort of leakage directly into the ocean -- unlikely to be because of atmosphere emissions or rain alone , said an official with the @entity36 , which operates the nuclear plant			1
a @entity36 official told @entity1 that authorities are not sure why the levels spiked			2
the official speculated that the radioactive iodine may have been swept off the coast recently into the @entity44 or the tainted water may have seeped from turbine buildings for two nuclear reactors that have shown the presence of radiation 10,000 times the normal amount			1
still , an official with @entity4 's nuclear safety agency told reporters saturday that -- while drinking such tainted seawater would be dangerous , given the radiation 's potential to cause cancer -- the effect on aquatic life may be relatively minimal			2
that 's because the radiation tends to dilute , the farther one moves away from the nuclear plant			2
@entity64 posted on the @entity4 's education and science ministry website showed relatively small amounts of radioactive particles several kilometers offshore			0
the @entity69 reported online saturday that radioactive iodine and cesium was detected 30 kilometers ( 19 miles ) offshore , but it said that these levels differed only slightly from the previous day			1
that said , its potential effect on @entity4 's fishing industry -- even if consumers stay away , for simple fear of contamination -- remains a major concern			0
so , too , is the fact that authorities have yet to pinpoint the exact source of the radiation , and thus to determine if it 's stopped			0
the latest data , from friday , posted online by @entity4 's education , science and technology ministry show continuing evidence of airborne radiation in prefectures around the nation			0
still , in no cases is the exposure considered harmful to human health -- and , in fact , in many cases , radiation readings have gone down			0
in the @entity9 prefecture where the plant is located , officials had screened 87,813 people for radiation exposure as of thursday , @entity4 's nuclear safety agency said a day later in a news release			2
of those 98 people had tested above limits for exposure , but once their clothes were removed and other measures taken , the exposure levels dropped and there was no effect on health			0
the agency also said screeners have examined thyroid glands of 66 children ranging in age from 1 to 15 and found that the " level of exposure of no problem			0
" the thyroid gland , particularly in children , can readily absorb radiation , health experts say			0
meanwhile , authorities continue to monitor radiation levels in tap water around @entity4			2
information from @entity4 's education , science and technology ministry indicate the presence of radioactive iodine in the tap water of 12 prefectures			1
this does not include @entity9 and @entity139 , where measurements are n't being taken because of damage from the march 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami			0
the government of @entity145 reported saturday that radiation levels had fallen considerably in the past 24 hours -- to levels that now would be considered safe enough even for babies to drink			1
levels of radioactive iodine , taken friday from water treatment facilities that serve the cities of @entity153 and @entity154 , range from 31 to 97 bequerels per kilogram of water			2
this is below the 100 becquerel threshold authorities advise it not be given to infants under 1 year old -- and well under the 300 - becquerel threshold for adults			0
a day earlier , water samples from four sites in @entity145 had levels between 119 becquerels of radioactive iodine to a high of 230 becquerels , all above the recommendations for babies			1
a second batch of data released friday from @entity0 's waterworks bureau showed levels remaining steady at 51 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of tap water			1
there were 76 becquerels from samples from @entity180 purification plant , which serves @entity181 , according to data on the @entity0 government site			0
the previous day , @entity0 gov. @entity184 lifted the previously announced recommendation that babies not drink tap water after tests from tuesday night showed levels of radiation more than twice the limit for babies			1
there was also good news friday 's in the @entity195 , where all five water treatment facilities had levels of radioactive iodine less than 100 becquerels per kilogram of tap water			1
the previous day , two plants in @entity195 had reported high levels .			0

new : besides radioactive iodine , high levels of cesium are also detected
a @entity36 official says it 's not known what caused the radiation spike
radiation in seawater near nuclear plant tests 1,250 times above normal
@entity217 levels in tap water in @entity145 now considered safe
