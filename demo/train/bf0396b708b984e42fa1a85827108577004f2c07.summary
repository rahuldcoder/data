@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was , in the words of local newspaper reporter @entity5 , a " megatrial for a little community			2
" a justice of the peace , accused of ripping off taxpayers , labeled " dishonorable " by a top prosecutor after his conviction last year and stripped of his job and his law license			0
now , amid an even larger investigation into the deaths of two @entity0 prosecutors this year , that former official , @entity15 , is jailed on $ 3 million bond -- charged with two counts of insufficient bond and one count of making a " terroristic threat			1
" authorities have n't explained the charges and they have not said if @entity15 ' arrest over the weekend is related to the investigation into the deaths of district attorney @entity29 , @entity29 's wife , @entity30 , and @entity31 -- the prosecutor who last year accused @entity15 of " using @entity0 as his own piggy bank			1
" @entity31 , @entity0 's chief felony prosecutor , died in a brazen daytime shooting outside the courthouse january 31			1
someone shot @entity29 , the county 's district attorney , and his wife , @entity30 , late last month at their @entity41 , @entity1 , home			1
authorities have not named a suspect or a motive for the killings			2
@entity48 , state and local authorities looking into the killings searched @entity15 ' home on friday , according to an @entity52 spokeswoman			1
a day later , @entity54 and @entity52 agents combed through a storage facility in @entity56 , @entity1 , on a search warrant also tied to the prosecutors ' deaths , the spokeswoman said			2
@entity2 affiliates @entity61 and @entity62 , citing anonymous sources , said authorities found 20 weapons and a white @entity65 in the storage unit			1
the car , @entity67 reported , matches the description of one seen near the @entity71 ' home around the time of their deaths			0
authorities have not named @entity15 as a suspect in the deaths			1
nor have they said the storage locker search had anything to do with the former justice of the peace , who has denied any involvement in the deaths through his attorneys and in interviews with local media			1
on friday , @entity15 ' attorney , @entity85 , released a statement saying his client " has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations			0
he wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice			0
" @entity85 did not respond to repeated e-mail and telephone messages over the weekend and monday seeking comment on developments in the case			0
in march 2012 -- almost a year before @entity29 's death -- @entity31 and @entity29 played prominent roles in prosecuting @entity15 on one count of burglary and one count of theft by a public official			1
accused of stealing computer equipment from a county building , he was convicted and sentenced to two years of probation			0
after the trial , @entity29 rejoiced that the conviction showed the county 's " good ol ' boy network is gone , " according to media reports			2
@entity31 called @entity15 " dishonorable " and a liar , according to the reports			0
but in a statement filed with the court after his conviction , @entity15 denied the thefts and called the loss of his law license " a life long sentence			0
" " i will have to seek another career , with a felony i will not be able to earn what i am used to , " he said , adding that it would be his wife , who he said was on disability , and his aging parents who would suffer the most			0
in a recent interview with @entity1 tv station @entity131 , @entity15 said he bore no ill will toward @entity31 or @entity29 , saying he felt the officials were just " doing their jobs			2
" but @entity5 , a reporter for @entity136 , said @entity29 told her before his death that he thought @entity15 was responsible for @entity31 's death			1
he divulged his suspicion , she says , while cautioning her to be careful			0
why ? " because i sat in the front row and covered this trial for 10 days , " she told @entity2 .			0
