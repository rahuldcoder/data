-- a school system in @entity2 , where more than a dozen female high school students are suffering from uncontrolled verbal outbursts and twitching , said it has hired a company to review environmental testing within the school and community			1
the development comes as famed activist @entity10 and other environmentalists are looking into whether a chemical that spilled in a 1970 train derailment about four miles from the school has anything to do with the girls ' mysterious behavior			1
one of @entity10 's associates walked the grounds of @entity20 on saturday and traveled to the derailment site			1
the @entity22 said it wanted " sound advice " from professionals on the situation , " void of self - interest			2
" " our community has suddenly found itself at the center of national attention due to the students who have been exhibiting neurological symptoms , " superintendent @entity28 said in a statement released friday			2
" this has led to much speculation , conjecture and misinformation in the national media and consequently within our community			2
" @entity28 said the school district is working with local , state and federal health and environmental agencies			1
a statement posted earlier on the school 's website said , in part , " the medical and environmental investigations have not uncovered any evidence that would link the neurological symptoms to anything in the environment or of an infectious nature			1
" the school district posted air quality and mold reports on its website			2
" water was also ruled out because the school is serviced by public water , " it said			2
the mother of one affected girl said she does n't think enough testing has been done			2
health officials say the girls ' symptoms are consistent with " conversion disorder			1
" @entity10 told @entity77 's " dr. @entity76 " on friday night that she will try to corroborate a note she said one of the affected family members received about the derailment			1
" the contaminated rock , fill and soil was used to build the new school , " @entity10 said of the note			1
according to the @entity85 @entity84 , one ton of cyanide crystals spilled onto the ground in the december 6 , 1970 , derailment			1
about 30,000 gallons of trichloroethene ( @entity90 ) , a potentially harmful contaminant , also were released from two ruptured tank cars , the agency said			2
" i have read and been involved in cases that we have had that @entity90 can be associated with neurological disorders , " @entity10 told @entity77			1
the first significant cleanup and remediation did not start for 20 years , she said , adding she was worried about the chemical getting into bedrock and groundwater supplies			2
the @entity90 may have reached the school grounds , she said			2
the @entity84 's @entity103 website provides a progress report of the cleanup done in the area over the past 20 years			1
" drinking wells in the area were found to have @entity90 contamination , " the @entity84 said			1
" sampling of private wells between 1990 and 1994 detected @entity90 in approximately 50 wells located east or southeast of the site			2
" the @entity84 installed water - treatment systems at 37 locations where @entity90 levels were high			0
the @entity116 used soil vapor extraction and bedrock vapor extraction to address the source of the contamination			0
" a water - line extension was selected to provide a safe , potable water supply to all affected residents and businesses , " the @entity84 said			0
@entity125 , an environmental water specialist associated with @entity10 , went to the derailment site saturday and took water samples to test for contaminants			1
he also took water samples from wells at private residences			0
an @entity77 producer saw several dozen drums in a fenced - off area at the derailment site , but it was not clear what they may contain			1
one was rusted and had dirt - like material inside			0
@entity10 gained fame after the 2000 movie bearing her name and starring @entity145 in the title role			1
it told the story of how she , as a file clerk at a law firm , established that a toxic chemical from a compressor station leaked into the groundwater of a nearby @entity155 town , according to a biography posted on @entity10 's website			1
medical experts , meanwhile , continue to investigate the girls ' symptoms , which in some cases , include stuttering			1
dr. @entity163 , a pediatric neurologist at the @entity164 who is treating many of the students affected , said , " conversion disorder is a physical manifestation of physiological symptoms where there is traditionally some kind of stress or multiple stressors that provoke a physical reaction within the body			1
" @entity163 said the symptoms are real			0
it is not done purposefully			0
" @entity180 , a senior on the honor roll at the school , said she has been fighting this affliction since october			0
she said after waking up from a nap , " i got upset , i could n't stop stuttering			1
" during an interview with @entity0 's @entity188 , @entity180 's symptoms were apparent : she was twitching uncontrollably , flailing her left arm and jerking her head to one side			1
@entity180 said she also faints and has seizures			0
the seizures are a result of her pre-existing epilepsy disorder , which had been under control for years			2
" i do n't think that all physical aspects of this have been exhausted ; not enough testing has been done , " @entity180 's mother , @entity197 , said			0
she also disagreed with @entity163 's assertion that the girls are improving , saying , " nothing is getting better , you know , the girls are still getting worse			0
they have good days and bad days			0
" @entity163 is not sure why so many girls at the same school are suffering all at once			0
" i do know that traditionally when they 've ( doctors ) looked back at different events that occurred in a similar nature , a majority of the time it is girls			0
" according to the @entity218 , females are much more likely to get conversion disorder and it is more common in adolescents or young adults			1
@entity163 said she used the " diagnosis of exclusion " to determine what happened to the girls , which means using the process of elimination			0
she ruled out a laundry list of factors to reach her diagnosis , including infections , drug use , food allergies and vaccine reactions , specifically @entity231			0
the @entity236 agreed with @entity163 's diagnosis after speaking with several doctors who evaluated the students			0
" there are many causes of tic - like symptoms			0
stress can often worsen them , " said spokesman @entity243			0
" the doctors all agree that the symptoms these girls are experiencing are real			0
" @entity77 's @entity249 reported from @entity250 , @entity2			0
@entity0 's @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity188 also contributed to this report .			0
