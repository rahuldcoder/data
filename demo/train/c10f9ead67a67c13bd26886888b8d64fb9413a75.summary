under court order , the @entity0 turned over nearly 65,000 pages of documents monday night pertaining to the botched @entity5 gun operation			1
for years , these documents have been at the center of a dispute between the @entity10 administration and congressional republicans , who demanded the documents back in 2011 as part of the investigation into the case			2
the documents were previously withheld under the administration 's claim of executive privilege			0
they portray the behind - the - scenes effort at the @entity0 to respond to the beginnings of the scandal over a flawed operation run by agents from @entity27 and prosecutors in the @entity29			1
suspected gun traffickers were allowed to buy thousands of weapons , many of which turned up at violent drug cartel crime scenes in the @entity35 and @entity36			1
the operation was exposed when a @entity35 border agent was killed in a shootout near the @entity41 - @entity36 border and two firearms tied to @entity5 suspects were recovered at the scene			1
want to know more about @entity5 ? get the fast facts at first , the @entity0 incorrectly said that the @entity27 always tried to stop weapons from being trafficked			1
after months of revelations from whistleblowers , the @entity0 acknowledged the scope of @entity5 , and the scandal badly damaged attorney general @entity52 's standing			1
he became the first sitting @entity54 member to be held in contempt of @entity56			0
rep. @entity57 , @entity58 , chairman of the @entity59 , said the documents turned over do n't satisfy a lawsuit he spearheaded seeking materials			1
@entity57 said in a statement : " when @entity52 wants to know why he was the first attorney general held in criminal contempt of @entity56 , he can read the judge 's order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and president @entity10 illegitimately and illegally withheld from @entity56			2
" since these pages still do not represent the entire universe of the documents the @entity74 is seeking related to the @entity0 's cover - up of the botched gun - walking scandal that contributed to the death of a @entity81 agent , our court case will continue			1
" i am deeply concerned that some redactions to these documents may still be inappropriate and contrary to the judge 's order in the case			0
this production is nonetheless a victory for the legislative branch , a victory for transparency , and a victory for efforts to check executive branch power			0
" as the production is extensive and may contain sensitive information , our investigative staff will be carefully examining the documents			0
" the documents were n't publicly released			0
but @entity100 reviewed a handful of the documents , which portray @entity52 frustrated as he tries to manage a controversy spiraling out of his control			0
in one april 2011 email exchange , he cautions aides against moving too forcefully to help block an @entity57 subpoena of a gun dealer who was helping law enforcement in an investigation			2
@entity52 lashed out : " @entity57 and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of @entity36 were being killed with guns from our country			2
all they want to do -- in reality -- is cripple @entity27 and suck up to the gun lobby			0
" the remark was a harbinger of a worsening relationship between @entity52 and @entity57 , which became public in bitter confrontations during congressional hearings			0
@entity129 , a @entity0 spokesman , said , " we have long been willing to provide many of these materials voluntarily in order to resolve this matter outside of court , and believe that producing them now should bring us a big step closer to concluding this litigation once and for all			0
" the official said the documents provided monday do n't contradict what the @entity0 has said about the @entity5 operation and support an inspector general 's finding that @entity52 did n't know about @entity5 before the controversy erupted .			1
