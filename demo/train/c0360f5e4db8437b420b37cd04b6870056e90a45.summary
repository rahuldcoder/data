-- " success breeds success			1
" so reads the motto of @entity4 , one of the most formidable breeding operations anywhere in the world			1
it is at the @entity10 's vast stud in @entity11 that one of the most eagerly - awaited births in the history of racing took place in february of this year when @entity17 , the winner of the 2008 @entity18 , gave birth to her foal by 2009 winner @entity22			1
" i 've rarely had that quality of stock to breed with , " explains @entity23 , stud manager to the @entity10			1
" it 's not every year you get a female winner of the @entity18 and a stallion that is also a champion and that you have access to			1
we tend not to do this type of mating with an unproven horse , with an unproven mare , but we thought this really had to be done			1
" despite an undefeated racing career of seven wins over seven starts , including her magnificent @entity18 triumph , @entity17 is said to be " unproven " because she has not as yet produced any winners herself			1
many successful racehorses fail to make an impact at stud			2
but @entity23 believes that the majestic thoroughbred has every chance of being a superior brood mare			2
" it 's all in the blood			2
if the foal can get all of the qualities of each of his parents then that would be marvelous			1
but if he does just half of what they each did individually then i think he will still be pretty good			2
" despite his illustrious pedigree , experts are divided about the exact role that genetics plays in determining a future champion			1
@entity68 , a professor at the @entity70 's @entity69 , believes punters should n't be pinning their hopes on the " superfoal " just yet			2
" estimates that have been looked at from my research perspective to see how well performance can be inherited suggest that somewhere in the order of between 10 - 40 per cent of inheritance can come from the parents with regards to performance , " said @entity68			2
" but of course many other factors can relate to whether an animal can be successful or not , such as conditions of the day , the ability of the jockey , the temperament of the horse and other environmental factors -- all of those things also play a role			0
" @entity23 is sanguine about his colt 's chances of emulating the success of his parents : " we have some very well - bred horses that can not run to save their lives			1
" our role is to give him all the opportunities : give him the right food , the right care			0
there are so many things that are going to happen between now and the day he starts racing			0
lots of people are going to be involved			0
it 's a team effort , including him , he 's part of the team			0
" ' success breeds success '			0
this is what we say			0
and it seems to work			0
" what 's in a name ? the foal is , as yet , unnamed			1
he wo n't be given a formal name until he starts racing at two years old			0
@entity23 explains the logic behind the name : " ideally it should contain a reference to both parents			0
" you would take the first three letters from the dam 's name and combine that with something to make a word that had some significance			0
we present a list of names to his highness the @entity10 and he makes the final decision			0

@entity4 is located in the @entity11 region of @entity147
the " @entity151 " born in february is the product of two champion horses
the foal is the child @entity18 winning *duo* @entity17 and @entity22
