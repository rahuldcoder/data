-- @entity1 was unstrapping his goaltending pads after another victory , about to be rushed to a tv interview , when a reporter on deadline made a request			1
could he answer just one quick question ? " yes , i 'm 40 , " @entity1 cracked , predicting the question before it could be asked			1
" for some reason , that 's a big deal			0
" well , it actually is , and the reason is simple : @entity1 could n't celebrate the milestone -- his birthday was may 6 -- because he was too busy notching another win en route to leading the @entity18 to the @entity19			1
and now , as the playoffs move to the final two rounds , @entity1 has a chance to win the @entity23 at an age when most players already have hung up their skates and picked up their golf clubs			1
turning 40 usually means collecting your gag gifts and waking up with a hangover and a realization : you 're not as young as you used to be			2
for @entity1 , it means doing what he 's done his entire adult life : winning hockey games at the highest level in the sport			1
no goaltender in @entity40 history has won more games than @entity1 : his 656 career victories are 105 more than @entity43 , who is second on the list			1
the next active goaltender on the all - time list , @entity45 , has just 339 , so it 's a record that may never be broken			2
and no one has appeared in a playoff game in his teens and his 40s , which became another line on @entity1 's long @entity54 © this week			1
he is the definition of longevity , and he 's not just hanging on by the edge of his skates , either			0
watch @entity1 's greatest saves " you go out , and you compete against players that are such a young age , " @entity1 said during the @entity18 ' second - round series against the @entity61 , which they won in five games			1
" i 'm more than twice the age of ( @entity18 rookie defenseman ) @entity68			1
i mean , you kind of shake your head a little bit			0
" but you 're able to play at a level when you 're having fun and you 're able to compete in a league you always wanted to play and still be able to keep going			0
for me , i do n't take anything for granted			2
i appreciate every moment , especially this year			0
it 's been awesome for me			0
" @entity1 has spent his entire career outside the limelight			1
that comes with the territory of playing in the @entity40 , the least popular of the four major @entity82 sports leagues , and playing for the devils , who lack the following of their rivals across the @entity87 , the @entity88			1
the devils , despite their continued success , are rarely picked for national tv games			2
that does n't diminish what he could accomplish this spring			2
when @entity1 won his first @entity23 , he was just 23			1
now , if the @entity18 continue their hot streak through the playoffs , he could win his fourth at 40			1
that would be a 17 - year gap between his first title and his last one			0
there are n't many athletes who can match that , but two who did -- @entity105 and @entity106 -- are recognized amongst the greatest in sports history			2
@entity1 is certainly among hockey 's greatest			2
along with his three @entity23 ( 1995 , 2000 , 2003 ) , he 's won two olympic gold medals ( 2002 , 2010 ) and the @entity110 as the league 's top goalie four times ( 2003 , 2004 , 2007 , 2008 )			1
his ability to handle the puck behind the net changed the sport , leading to a rule change that restricted where goalies could play the puck			0
his critics have said that @entity1 benefited from the @entity18 ' defensive approach for years			1
but his former role model -- who later became his biggest rival -- thought that argument was unfair			0
" i remember in the playoffs , he once said he was facing more critics than shots , " said @entity43 , who owns most of the @entity40 goaltending records that @entity1 does n't have			1
" i thought it was a nice way to deal with the pressure			0
from the outside watching him , he almost makes it look easy , but i know how tough it is			0
" @entity43 retired in 2003 , when he was 37			2
@entity1 is in the final year of his contract but has said he 's leaning toward coming back next year -- his 20th in a @entity18 uniform -- " if they 're going to take me back			1
" he said he 's having too much fun to stop now			0
" you have to enjoy what you do , " he said			0
" i 've been here for so long that i 've had different roles regardless of me playing or not playing			0
just watching guys and helping guys during their careers to make the right decisions			0
you have to think the right way and go through hurdles for success			0
" the 40 - year - old goaltender is doing what 's he 's done for two decades now : winning hockey games			1
about the only time he shows his age is when he counted the candles on the birthday cake from his family			2
there were only about 20 of them			0
" could n't find a big enough cake , i guess , " he said with a laugh .			0

@entity18 goalie @entity1 turned 40 on may 6
