the clear - voiced mobile dj went all out on " @entity3 " and all she got was this lousy @entity5 haircut			2
( i said i liked it yesterday , but everything looks different now			2
) @entity1 just never had a proper " idol " moment on the live stage , and she 's not a tiny teen			1
i think it boils down to that			2
the tiny teens will overtake us all			2
they 're outside your window , waiting to strike , right now			2
you just ca n't see them because they 're so young , and quick , and relevant			2
are you even there ? you may have become obsolete just reading this			2
@entity23 and @entity24 joined @entity1 in the bottom three			1
the hair up there was a tepid mess wednesday night , but @entity23 , who wore " i 've given up " track pants for the results show , should have been the one to go home			1
@entity32 hammered home @entity33 's " wake up call " remarks to @entity23 from wednesday in his taped comments , comparing @entity23 's clownish performance of " @entity39 " to " four minutes of a bad @entity41 movie that goes straight to @entity42			1
" @entity23 , shown in the corner of the screen during @entity32 's rant , was all " so what , @entity41 is awesome , you b * * * * * * still ca n't faze me ! " but @entity32 threw it down			1
" @entity49 has to spend a lot of money on someone who wins the show , and that 's not it			1
" @entity55 asked @entity23 to respond , and the class clown offered two confounding non-clarifications for his behavior			0
1 ) " when i was ripping the clothes off , it was a metaphor for who i really am , " and 2 ) " i 'm not trying to be a star			0
i 'm just really happy where i am , so ...			0
" it 's to @entity1 's credit that she did n't slap him here , knowing she was probably headed home in a few minutes instead of this bleary - eyed prankster who 'd just announced he was n't too interested in a singing career after all			1
that attitude simply will not fly , especially when you work with kids in @entity74 's native @entity73			1
" you should n't sell yourself short			0
you should teach those kids they can be stars , too , " @entity76 sweetly reminded @entity23 , her " superpink " gown blowing up a giant bubble of disappointment that soon encapsulated all three judges			0
@entity83 had to cut to commercial and then pop the bubble with one of @entity88 's spare pins			1
@entity90 is not a star ! ! ! here is a star			0
this ! is " @entity3			0
" no , seriously , this is practically the logo for the show , but way better			0
@entity97 is a bada * * b * tch			1
to perform the hell out of her new single " @entity102 , " @entity97 wore a long , gauzy red gown with some severe @entity104 and a sparkly hair clip that put @entity88 's pin collection to shame			1
aggggh ! i 've watched this maybe ... .15 times ? 20 ? and i spent the afternoon listening to " @entity102 " and @entity97 's studio recordings from season 10 of " idol " on @entity112			1
i 'd forgotten how much i love her -- and what a stunning visual performer she is			0
i lose my breath a little whenever she throws one arm up in the air with her signature " i love singing ! " dreamy expression and head tilt			0
but that 's probably because i 'm so unhealthy and never get off of my couch			1
let 's go , @entity123 ! make @entity97 happen ! " the breakout star known as @entity126 " barely croaked out " @entity127 " in a pre-taped segment			1
if you 're unfamiliar with this creature , she is an old woman who crawled out of a dumpster behind a vintage clothing store in east @entity133 and wandered onto " the scene			0
" they scrubbed her off , restricted her to a diet of cigarettes and virginal white clothing , and now she 's everywhere			1
i do n't quite understand it either			0
i will say that @entity126 's studio recordings are a million bazillion times better than anything she does live			2
this demo version of " @entity143 " in particular was my first introduction to her and is not terrible			0
does she suffer from chronic severe pain , do you think ? why does she always look so wretched as she whimpers out notes ? my guess is that she knows they 're going to be the wrong ones so she 's just bracing herself			2
meanwhile , @entity33 's birthday is coming up , so the @entity155 awkwardly sang to him with ...			1
@entity156 ! no one in the first few rows knows who that is ! how uncomfortable ! anyway , the surprise appearance was a big deal because @entity164 's lead guitarist had been pretty vocally anti- " idol " back when @entity33 first decided to do the show			1
i could still sense his inner cringe , but hey , it 's @entity33 's birthday			1
the graphics department even went all out with @entity170			0
oh , " @entity3 , " you should n't have			0
please do n't ever again			0
so this week the @entity155 9 -- @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity24 , and @entity23 ( did i just name my @entity180 ? ! ) -- will move into the " @entity3 " mansion			1
hopefully this one wo n't flood			0
but i do hope someone falls down the stairs like @entity184			0
i do n't want anyone to get hurt , but i want it to happen			0
" it 's a cool mansion , " confirmed @entity83			2
" all mansions are cool			0
" he would know ! are you pissed about these results ? do you think the judges should have used their save on @entity1 even though clearly voters were n't connecting with her ? read what @entity1 told @entity0 after her elimination -- about her vocal limitations , those party favors , and @entity3 's " women of a certain age " problem -- here			1
