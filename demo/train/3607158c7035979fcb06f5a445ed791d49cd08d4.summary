-- in 1995 , @entity1 had just launched her career			1
the actress , then 18 , had one professional credit to her name -- a role in an @entity8 after - school special , according to @entity9			2
oh what a difference a few years can make			0
now @entity11 is the star of the hit @entity8 series " scandal , " and she 's nominated for outstanding lead actress in a drama at sunday 's @entity17			1
the last time an @entity20 - @entity19 woman was up for such an honor was when she was starting out			2
( @entity22 was nominated for her work in " @entity24 " in 1995			1
) @entity11 already has made history as the first black actress to lead a network tv drama in almost 40 years			1
@entity28 was the lead actress of a cable drama , @entity31 's " @entity30 , " which was canceled in 2011			1
record accomplishments aside , it is undeniable @entity11 is having a moment			1
not only has she seemingly been on the cover of every magazine lately , but the actress also managed to pull off a @entity40 coup by getting married without the world even knowing she was dating			2
" i do n't want to sound smug about it ... but the point is to do what 's best for me , " @entity11 recently told @entity43 magazine of secretly marrying @entity45 cornerback @entity44			1
" i have girlfriends in this business who talk about their personal lives , and it works for them , and i love it			0
" for most , the first time @entity11 grabbed attention was as struggling teen mom @entity57 in the 2001 film " @entity59			2
" she followed that with roles in movies both big and small -- from " @entity65 " with @entity66 and @entity67 to the indie " @entity64			0
" despite positive reviews and glowing praise from her contemporaries , @entity11 had a career that was slow and steady at best			2
she finally began to break out when critics hailed her portrayal of @entity76 ' wife , @entity75 , opposite @entity77 in the 2004 @entity79 - nominated film " @entity76			0
" the pair teamed up again in 2012 for @entity82 's " @entity81			0
" but it is her role on the small screen as political power fixer @entity86 on " scandal " that has brought @entity11 the most recognition -- from the emmy nomination to @entity92 's best dressed star of 2013			1
according to " scandal " creator @entity94 , all the accolades could n't be happening to a more well - deserving actress			0
@entity1 talks @entity86 , slavery and politics " she knows every single person 's name ( on the show ) , " @entity94 recently told @entity99			1
" she gave out the prizes in our little weight - loss competition that we had on set			0
and , more importantly -- and this is a thing i am really trying to learn from her -- i have never heard @entity1 complain			2
that sounds like a casual thing to toss off , but think about the fact that she works more hours than anybody			0
i literally never hear her complain			0
that is a very rare breed of person			0
" it is also rare how @entity11 is able to keep her personal life private while still appearing accessible to fans			1
" @entity88 's " success -- and consequently her own -- has partly been attributed to the series ' active social media presence			0
cast members live tweet during every episode , and @entity11 is especially engaged with fans -- retweeting them and answering their questions			2
according to @entity133 , the social media strategy paid off last season in the form of higher ratings and increased buzz			0
for @entity11 , it translated into the chance to compete with @entity140 of " homeland " and @entity142 of " @entity143 " for television 's most prestigious honor			1
@entity11 has said she fully embraces the recognition , but for her , it has always been about the craft			1
" i do n't approach the work or the life of the work from the perspective of , like , what are voters gon na think , " @entity11 told @entity149 after she was nominated			1
" or , what are critics gon na think ? i just ca n't			0
once you try to please a specific perspective or audience , it gets in the way of the work			0
the work is telling the story , and that 's what you have to do : tell the story in the best way possible to serve the creative vision and to serve the story			2
you can never control how it 's going to be received			0
" fans are looking forward to see what will happen sunday , but to them , @entity11 's already a winner .			1

actress is the first black woman to be nominated in her @entity179 *category* since 1995
@entity1 has managed to keep her personal life private
despite acclaim and recognition , it 's all about the work for @entity11
