the suspect , who police say may be pregnant and may go by the name " @entity12 , " took the girl to a nearby house where a male suspect waited			1
once inside the home , authorities say , the girl was told to remove her clothing and was given a black t - shirt to wear			2
she was blindfolded and forced to hide under a bed , they said			0
she was fed at some point			0
