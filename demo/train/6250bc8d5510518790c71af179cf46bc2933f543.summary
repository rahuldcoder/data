-- @entity1 is no longer just a bridesmaid			1
the " @entity3 winner and " bridesmaids " scene - stealer has some big plans on her plate -- from launching her own plus - size fashion line to getting hockey 's prized @entity9 ( for a movie ) -- during what is already a stellar year for her			2
but none of her professional plans can top her favorite pastime , being mom to her two daughters with actor - husband @entity19 : @entity20 , 4 , and @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity1 tells the @entity23 that being a mother actually helps her feel less insecure about her looks			1
" the stupid stuff like what i wear or how i look i ca n't control , so i just try not to give too much energy to it , " she says , calling her body a work in progress after giving birth to @entity21			0
" at 20 , i would have been like : ' do n't they like me ? was it my hair ? ' at 41 , i think the things that define me , i hope , are a lot more than those kinds of petty things			0
" as for those red - carpet moments , " trying to find stuff that 's still fashion - forward in my size is damn near impossible			2
it 's either for like a 98 - year - old woman or a 14 - year - old hooker , and there is nothing in the middle , " @entity1 wisecracks			1
case in point : trying to outfit herself for the emmys , which required sifting through " nine million dresses with taffeta or shiny bows			0
" the final result was @entity1 's own line that she is co-designing with couturier @entity61			1
hosting @entity62 fans need n't fret , however -- she 'll still be doing comedy , including hosting this weekend 's " @entity65			1
" she psyched for this , too , admitting to having an emotional reaction when the producers invited her to do it			0
" i went into such an embarrassing , weird , inappropriately loud cry , " says @entity1			2
" i 'm bent over , literally , in the rug section of @entity71 , wailing			0
" also ahead : starring in and co-writing a movie with " bridesmaids " scribe @entity74 , which is about hijacking the @entity9 to cheer up her sick husband ; costarring with @entity77 in a movie comedy ( still in the talking stage ) ; and appearing in @entity82 's as - yet - untitled " @entity81 " spin - off -- and that , reportedly , is only for starters			2
