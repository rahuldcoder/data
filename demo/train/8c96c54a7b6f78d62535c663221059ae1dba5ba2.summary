@entity0 -- former @entity5 gov. @entity4 arrived at a @entity7 federal prison thursday to begin serving a 14 - year sentence on a corruption conviction , a spokesman for the @entity3 said			1
" this is the hardest thing i 've ever had to do , " he told a crowd of sign - wielding supporters outside his @entity0 home wednesday before reporting to prison			1
" but this is the law and we follow the law			0
" he was convicted of corruption in june 2011 after a jury returned 17 guilty verdicts against him			2
among other allegations , he was accused of trying to profit as he considered whom to appoint to take @entity24 's open @entity23 seat			0
@entity4 called his impending prison stint a " dark and hard journey , " and said he should have been more humble			1
" we are so grateful and will never ever forget your kindness to us , " he told the crowd , which occasionally chanted slogans such as " free our governor			0
" his wife , @entity33 , remained cinched under his arm , squeezing back tears as the former governor spoke			0
" this , as bad as it is , is part of a long and hard journey that will only get worse before it gets better , " @entity4 said , telling his wife that he loved her			1
he 'll serve his sentence at @entity42 , southwest of @entity43			1
" governor @entity4 has always stood up and stood tall			1
and he has truly enjoyed being out in public			0
he never considered ' sneaking ' out of @entity0 and miss an opportunity to say goodbye , " his spokesman @entity45 said earlier			1
" it 's difficult to put into words the challenges he and his family now face			0
but he draws strength from the incredible support he continues to receive from the people of @entity5 and beyond			1
" @entity4 's past statements have been noteworthy for their bluster			1
in a defiant news conference in april 2010 , he called his accusers " liars " and " cowards , " and directly challenged a prosecutor			0
@entity4 also accused @entity64 attorney @entity63 of hiding taped evidence that would prove his innocence during that news conference			2
" i challenge mr. @entity63 ... why do n't you show up in court tomorrow and explain to everybody , explain to the whole world why you do n't want the tapes that you made played in court ? " @entity4 said to reporters at the time			2
" i 'll be in court tomorrow			0
i hope you 're man enough to show up , " he added , referring to @entity63			0
prosecutors said court - authorized wiretaps caught @entity4 offering @entity24 's @entity23 seat in exchange for personal gain , including a job with a nonprofit or union organization , corporate board posts for his wife , campaign contributions or a post in @entity24 's administration			1
he expressed frustration , according to prosecutors , that @entity24 transition officials were " not willing to give me anything except appreciation			0
" " i 've got this thing and it 's ( expletive ) golden , and , uh , uh , i 'm just not giving it up for ( expletive ) nothing			0
i 'm not gon na do it , " prosecutors quoted @entity4 as saying			2
@entity4 also considered appointing himself to the post , mulling whether he might be better off being indicted as a senator rather than governor , and saying contacts he would make in the federal job would benefit him later , according to prosecutors			1
aside from the charges of trying to sell the @entity23 seat , prosecutors also accused @entity4 of using his position to obtain financial benefits for himself , his family and his campaign in exchange for jobs , contracts and appointments to state boards to supporters			1
they accused @entity4 of accelerating the scheme in 2008 to accumulate funds before a new state ethics law would have limited his ability to raise money from people and companies that were doing business with the state			2
despite months of professing his innocence in impromptu news conferences , on @entity130 and even on @entity132 's show " @entity131 , " the ousted @entity5 governor did not take the stand in his own defense during his trial			2
@entity1 's @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
