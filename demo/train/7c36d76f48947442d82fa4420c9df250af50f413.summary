@entity0 -- their faces stare from old photos , their voices silent since @entity6 swept through @entity7 in the @entity8 on friday			1
at first @entity9 was n't worried			1
her family was close , they kept in touch			2
soon , no doubt , she 'd hear from her home in @entity0 that all were safe			0
but three days later , that call has n't come			0
around 30 family members are missing			1
" it 's my uncle , my mom 's brother is missing			1
all his children , his wife , everyone			1
my cousin is missing with her six children , they range in age from 9 to 19			1
then i have many , many other missing cousins			1
but these are the ones we 're the closest with -- and they 're nowhere to be found , " @entity9 said			2

instead , her family , some of whom are based in @entity49 , has been trying to hire someone to go to @entity7 to search for them , but no one seems to want to go			1
" if no one can or is even willing to do it , i ca n't even begin to imagine the situation there , " she said			0
" in the @entity8 you can buy anything and anyone			0
i hate to say it but that 's the truth			0
so if we ca n't even pay someone to go in and look for them ... " @entity9 said , her voice trailing off			2

she 's concerned for his safety if he 's left to fend for himself			0
she says her uncle does n't always make the most sensible decisions , and fears what could happen " if he does n't have his children with him to make good decisions for him			2
" @entity9 is checking @entity78 pages where lists have been posted of survivors found in medical centers , and others are posting photos of lost family members in the hope that someone 's seen them			1
one of the largest is " @entity7 ( and nearby @entity88 ) @entity87 " where more than 17,000 users are swapping messages in a mixture of @entity93 and the local language , @entity95			2
among the pleas for help are stories of survival			0
" @entity100 ... just got a call from our mother and they are all complete and safe ... they survived by drinking only water in our deep wheel without foods in 4 days ... they walked 6 hours to reach the @entity110 just to be able to contact us			0
. they are now going to the airport to take the @entity115 to @entity116 with my relatives , " writes @entity112			0
@entity9 is hoping for a similar tale of survival but so far has seen nothing that has offered anything beyond graver fears that her family has disappeared without a trace			1
