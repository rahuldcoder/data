-- it is now more than 20 years since pro-democracy grassroots organizations led struggles that eventually resulted in the overthrow of long - serving authoritarian regimes in many countries in @entity7			1
since the 1990s , there have been significant improvements in the transition to democratic governance in @entity7			1
however , there have also been some major reversals			2
click on the interactive map above to find out more about @entity7 's governments			1
unfortunately , some pre- 1990 incumbent leaders ( for example , @entity16 of @entity17 and @entity18 of @entity19 ) remain in power , despite efforts by the opposition to unseat them			0
in addition , @entity25 , which had made significant progress toward deepening and institutionalizing democracy , suffered major regression , first , by the capture and subsequent occupation of the northern part of the country by a group of separatist rebels , and second , by a military coup that ousted its democratically elected government			1
soldiers also intervened in @entity39 , suspended government institutions and proceeded to engage in activities that seriously undermined the rule of law			1
meanwhile , violent mobilization by ethnic and religious groups continue to negatively impact governance in @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50			0
the failure of national institutions to grant adequate protection to individual liberties continues to plague countries such as @entity56 , where a @entity58 report says several prison inmates were executed last year without due process of law , and @entity7 where the police last year used deadly force against miners who were exercising their rights to strike			1

@entity75 continues to lead the way			1
first , after the country 's president , @entity78 , died in office in july 2012 , he was succeeded , as required by the constitution , by the country 's vice president , @entity82			1
second , in december 2012 , the country held competitive , fair and peaceful elections , which were won by @entity82			2
he was subsequently sworn in as the country 's president			0
finally , @entity75 has also shown significant leadership in openness and transparency in government			1
in 2003 , @entity75 committed to the extractive industries transparency initiative and has since emerged as a leading example of how governments can minimize corruption in the management of public revenues from the extractive sector			2

@entity105 , after a violent and extremely bloody civil war , inaugurated a new president , followed by the development of new laws and institutions , especially those dealing with corruption and openness and transparency in government			0
in addition , the country now has a fully functioning legislative assembly , and the country 's security situation , previously worsened by sectarian strife , has improved significantly			0
@entity106 , whose institutions were destroyed by a long and brutal civil war , has seen restoration of many national institutions and a return to the rule of law			0
this is exemplified by the fact that the country 's 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections were free , fair and peaceful and the results were accepted by the people			0
the winners went on to form a government which continues to rule the country in peace			2
@entity145 also held elections in 2012 , which resulted in the peaceful transfer of power			0
since taking office , the new president , @entity149 , has made significant efforts to improve openness and transparency in government , as well as force public officials to be accountable to the constitution and the people			0
@entity107 's governance system was strengthened by successfully conducting fair and free elections , which resulted in the peaceful transfer of power			0
both @entity108 and @entity39 saw some improvements in their governance systems -- in @entity39 , opportunities for civic dialogue improved significantly and in @entity108 , the death of the sitting president was not followed by bloody chaos ; instead , as required by the constitution , the vice president , @entity160 , was inaugurated the new president			1
the @entity170 brought significant improvements to governance structures in @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
the tragic death of @entity104 street vendor @entity175 , by self - immolation , brought about a grassroots political movement among @entity104 that effectively overthrew the country 's authoritarian ruler , @entity180 @entity178			2
this movement , which was subsequently nicknamed the @entity170 , spread to @entity102 and @entity103 , resulting in the ouster of long - serving dictatorships in those countries as well			2
elections , considered fair and free , have since been held in all three countries and each now has a democratically elected government			0
nevertheless , many groups within these countries , especially those which historically have suffered exploitation and persecution at the hands of their governments ( e.g. , ethnic and religious minorities , and women ) have expressed the fear that although these new regimes came to power through democratic elections , they are likely to reject or abandon democracy once they have had a chance to consolidate their power bases			1
already , such fears appear to be coming true in @entity102 , where the new president , @entity206 , has already engaged in extra-constitutional practices to grab more power for himself			0
in addition , the elected parliament was dissolved by the anachronistic supreme constitutional court , and the new constitution was hurriedly drafted and done so through a top - down , elite - driven , non-participatory process			0
as a consequence , what had started as a dynamic grassroots - led program to transform @entity102 's laws and institutions and produce a more effective and relevant governance architecture , has degenerated into a struggle by entrenched interests , led by @entity206 and his @entity224 , to further entrench themselves politically and economically			0
in @entity104 , the revolution , which since the ouster of @entity178 had been progressing well , despite opposition from several @entity230 groups , suffered significant regression following the brutal and cowardly assassination of @entity233 , a secularist and staunch critic of the ruling @entity230 - led government of prime minister @entity237			0
meanwhile , the brutal assassination of the @entity240 ambassador and the wanton destruction of property in @entity243 , the cradle of the @entity103 revolution , is indicative of a still - born transformation , one that had failed to create institutions capable of guaranteeing the rule of law in @entity103			0
the struggles of grassroots organizations in @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity102 are symptomatic of what needs to be done throughout @entity7 to deepen and institutionalize democracy			1
read also : western - style democracy ' not suitable for @entity7 ' ? the many individuals that participated in @entity257 's grassroots revolution to replace authoritarianism with democracy are frustrated because their revolutions did not achieve their critical goals -- reconstruction and reconstitution of anachronistic and dysfunctional state systems inherited from the @entity266 Â© gimes to provide legal and judicial systems that guarantee the just rule of law			1
that is , laws and institutions that protect individuals ' rights , including protecting all citizens from violence directed at them either by state or non-state actors , and enhance people 's ability to engage in productive activities to create the wealth that they need to fight poverty and improve their living conditions			0
such laws are consistent with the provisions of the universal declaration of human rights and other international human rights instruments			0
these revolutions , as has been the case in other @entity7 countries , were hijacked by entrenched opportunists , whose main interest is in preserving the status quo , so that they can continue to use these anachronistic state structures to enrich themselves at the expense of their fellow citizens			2
in order to advance the transition to democratic governance in @entity7 , as well as minimize the chances of regression , each @entity7 country must engage all its relevant stakeholder groups in state reconstruction through democratic ( i.e. , bottom - up , participatory , inclusive and people - driven ) constitution making to produce institutional arrangements that adequately constrain civil servants and political elites , enhance the ability of each country 's diverse population groups to coexist peacefully , and create economic and political environments that maximize entrepreneurial activities and the creation of wealth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity321 .			2

last 20 years have seen gains , reversals in transition to democracy in @entity7 , says @entity321
he says @entity75 continues to lead the way , @entity25 and @entity39 have suffered setbacks
@entity170 brought improvements , but more change is needed
each @entity7 country must engage in democratic constitution making , says @entity321
