the 2016 presidential race is just beginning			0
yet we already can say this much : despite a bump in the polls , and the fact that some conservatives consider him the prototype for successful leaders , @entity4 gov. @entity3 would be a terrible choice for the @entity13 nomination			1
of course , @entity13 have made bad choices before			0
a recent @entity16 survey found @entity3 to be the first pick of 15 % of the @entity13 faithful likely to attend the @entity19			1
so why would @entity3 be a bad choice ? three reasons			1
the world is a dangerous place			0
we ca n't afford another commander - in - chief with no foreign policy experience who does n't understand @entity29 's role in the world			1
as the governor of @entity4 -- as opposed to @entity29 senator ( @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity35 ) or a former @entity37 ambassador ( @entity36 ) -- @entity3 's diplomatic experience is limited to settling disputes with @entity40 during football season			1
he would be learning on the job while rogue actors like @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 threaten @entity29 , create unrest and perpetuate acts of terror			1
there are times to look to the states and elect leaders who can focus the nation 's attention on domestic priorities like the economy , and there are times to look for leaders with a firm handle on foreign policy because the stakes are too high to gamble on that front			1
guess which era we 're living in			2
built - in enemies are extra baggage			2
@entity3 has repeatedly fought organized labor in @entity4 -- over collective bargaining , an attempted recall , running for re-election -- and scored impressive victories			1
but @entity3 has also antagonized that special interest , which will spend tens of millions of dollars in the presidential election to settle the score			1
unions might otherwise feel ambivalent about a @entity81 candidacy , especially with the prospect of an insurgent campaign by sen. @entity84 of @entity85 , who would likely embrace more firmly the divisive rhetoric about income equality that union members love to hear			0
if @entity3 is the @entity13 nominee , ambivalence will be trumped by anger			1
an activated and animated base of union supporters throwing money at the @entity94 is a headache that @entity13 do n't need			2
@entity3 is not eager to grab hold of thorny issues			1
on immigration , he likes sound bites , declaring his opposition to " amnesty " and his support for " securing the border			0
" he uses platitudes about how ours is " a country both of immigrants and of laws			0
" during a recent appearance on @entity114 's " @entity113 , " host @entity110 asked @entity3 what he would do about the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants			1
the governor responded that , while he did n't support the immigration bills in @entity119 , he did think the debate needs a " healthy balance " and he was not " advocating " the deportation of all illegal immigrants			2
finally , he said , " we need to enforce the laws in the @entity29 , and we need to find a way for people to have a legitimate legal immigration system in this country , and that does not mean amnesty			2
" clear as mud , eh ? @entity3 also has difficulty on common - sense issues that should not be all that thorny , like evolution			1
on a trip to @entity138 this week , presumably intended to beef up his " foreign policy credentials , " the governor bobbled a question on the topic and had to issue a follow - up statement			1
the only benefit that @entity13 could reap from nominating @entity3 is that , while he is probably not ready to lead the country , he could settle an argument within the party that the @entity13 must resolve and put behind it if @entity13 are ever going to win another presidential election			2
most of the conservatives i know who think @entity3 should be the @entity13 nominee are convinced that @entity13 keep making the same mistake of nominating moderates			2
the secret to beating @entity94 , they say , is to draw contrasts and stay true to conservative principles			0
@entity13 are confused : do they nominate a moderate with wider appeal or a " true conservative " loyal to the party 's principles ? the way that those on the far right see it , they 've failed twice with a moderate nominee ( sen. @entity167 of @entity168 in 2008 , former @entity85 gov. @entity163 in 2012 )			0
if the party nominates another moderate in 2016 ( former @entity171 gov. @entity170 , @entity173 gov. @entity172 , former @entity175 gov. @entity174 , etc. ) , and loses again , that faction will continue to delude itself into thinking that the @entity13 must nominate a rigid conservative to win			0
there is only one cure for this delusion : @entity13 need to scratch that itch and nominate a person they believe to be a strong conservative			0
and when they nominate him , and lose anyway , they can put this argument to rest			0
republicans will have run out of excuses			0
only then , can they achieve the epiphany that could save them from going the way of the @entity191 : voters are n't just rejecting the @entity13 's messenger but its message			2
to many @entity29 , @entity13 are mean - spirited , intolerant , xenophobic and reactionary obstructionists who care only about the rich , preserving the status quo and protecting the majority , and who are better at explaining what they 're against than spelling out what they 're for			1
much of what we hear from @entity13 candidates -- especially those trying to woo conservative voters -- reinforces that perception			0
if the @entity13 crafts a better message , it wo n't have to worry so much about choosing the right messenger			0
but first , the party has an argument to settle			0
so , at the moment , there is only one message that matters : @entity217 , @entity218 .			0

@entity220 : @entity3 does n't have the foreign policy credentials or the courage needed for today 's era .
he says the only plus if he 's nominated is that it would prove @entity29 does n't want a hard - right president
