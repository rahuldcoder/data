-- " @entity5 " reads the plaque on the classroom door of @entity3 in @entity4			0
nutritional advice and tactics are scribbled on the whiteboard and a @entity10 portrait hangs on the wall			0
but if the future of the domestic sport lies at the feet of new talent , youngsters are dreaming of playing in stadiums abroad , not at home			2
endemic problems over the last four decades have slumped the nation to a low 149 out of 209 in @entity23 's world rankings , moving @entity23 president @entity24 to describe @entity26 football as a " sleeping giant			1
" however , the arrival of @entity30 coach @entity29 as the nation 's first technical director signals a possible revival of a country with a 1.2 billion population			1
appointed in october 2011 , @entity29 was previously the technical director in the @entity30 and caretaker coach for the @entity38 under 23 team			1
in @entity26 , he says he had spotted about five boys aged below 10 whose skills were on par with @entity43 youngsters of that age group			1
qualifying for the @entity45 it is still early days , but @entity29 believes with continued development of @entity26 's grassroots , the country might be ready to participate in the @entity49			1
" or more realistically , 2026 or 2030 , " he adds			0
" as @entity26 has just started to implement grassroots football it will take 10 years or more to get these players to the same level as in @entity54 , @entity55 , or @entity56 and @entity57			1
" this grassroots project involves the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) opening residential academies all over the country , free to athletes and providing education alongside football training			2
these are different to the academies run by overseas clubs such as @entity69 champion @entity3 , which require fees and are non-residential			0
the first @entity59 academy opened in @entity72 , @entity4 in may 2012 , the second in september 2012 in @entity74 , another recently in @entity75 , with a fourth coming soon in @entity76			0
" we already have our under - 19 boys in @entity75 and that will now be our elite academy , possibly moving to @entity81 in the coming months , " said @entity29			1
@entity82 , ceo of the @entity59 's domestic @entity83 , has high hopes for this new development			2
" i think this is the first positive step that @entity26 football and the @entity59 have taken in the last 30 years , " he said			1
up until the 1970s , @entity26 , which has long been one of the world 's top sides at cricket , was among the best sides in @entity94 football and the national team was even invited by @entity23 to play in the 1950 @entity45 in @entity96			1
in the end @entity26 failed to make it to @entity96			1
according to football historian and statistician @entity102 , the journey by ship was too expensive and the players were unable to fulfill the compulsory requirement to wear football boots , as they usually played with bare feet			2
the @entity59 has governed football in @entity26 for 75 years and was responsible for appointing @entity29			1
located in @entity109 in southwest @entity110 , the @entity59 's headquarters is an impressive building crowned with a huge football			1
is @entity26 a sporting country ? despite that bold architectural statement , @entity82 is more downbeat in his assessment of the country 's competence : " @entity26 lacks sporting passion and is not really a sporting country			1
" that surprising admission provoked astonishment from two @entity26 football experts			1
" @entity26 has been playing football , as well as cricket , for over 100 years , " @entity102 told @entity0			1
" there are so many individuals in cricket , football , athletics and hockey			2
" we 've won gold medals and been world champions , despite being amateur players			0
if @entity26 is not a sporting nation , then why are there so many people playing sport on the ground ? " former @entity26 soccer star @entity139 , who briefly played for @entity141 lower division team @entity140 in 1999 , added : " if the @entity59 says @entity26 's not a sporting nation , then what are they doing there ? you have to make it a sporting nation ! " @entity82 defends his view and says @entity26 does not have a strong presence at the @entity149			1
referring to how interest in cricket soared after the first @entity45 win in that sport in 1983 , he says : " if the national team does well , it suddenly changes the equation completely			1
" @entity26 's national captain @entity157 believes the @entity59 's criticism of the team dampens their confidence and argues everyone should be working together			1
@entity157 gave @entity26 a sign of hope when he joined the reserve side of @entity166 club @entity165 in july last year , with @entity26 football pundit @entity167 describing the move as the " biggest ever transfer of an @entity26 footballer			1
" but the main goal should be for @entity26 to renew national pride in their home game , which currently rejoices in its past			1
beating the @entity175 @entity175 soldiers introduced the sport to the country in the 19th century and an @entity26 team even beat them at their own game to win a domestic tournament in 1911			1
@entity102 says this victory gave @entity26 the confidence to make the move towards independence , which finally happened 36 years later			1
however the influence of @entity141 -- or rather the @entity69 -- still hangs heavy over @entity26 football			1
at @entity139 's academy in @entity110 , 14 - year - old @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 say they stay awake until the early hours to keep up with the @entity192 and the @entity45			2
and they all wish to go to @entity56 to play professionally			0
" in the @entity69 , i support @entity195			0
and for @entity198 , it 's @entity199 , " says @entity189 , without hesitation			2
" but i do n't really know much about @entity26 football			1
" in december 2010 , @entity59 signed a 15 - year lucrative seven billion rupee ( $ 1.3 million ) marketing deal with @entity26 's @entity201 --- a world - leading sports management company -- to boost the promotion of domestic football			1
@entity82 says revamping the @entity83 is a priority			0
but that was over two years ago and experts say little improvement has been made since			0
the @entity209 ( @entity209 ) , which manages football in @entity211 , organized the country 's first international friendly between the hugely popular @entity214 and @entity215 in 2011			2
crowds packed out the 120,000 - capacity @entity217 in @entity219 for a glimpse of @entity215 's superstar @entity221			2
but while tickets were in short supply to watch arguably the world 's best player , local matches remain abandoned on unpopular television channels and without effective promotion			2
last year , private company @entity229 organized a @entity230 , spending almost $ 7 million bidding for retired @entity45 players , including former @entity234 international @entity233			0
however , the stadiums were not ready in time , which led to an indefinite postponement and players left in limbo without their wages			0
again , these efforts , independent of the @entity59 , did not make noticeable improvements to the home game			0
@entity219 - based @entity244 and @entity245 are the biggest @entity26 clubs with a historical 86 - year long rivalry , comparable to the @entity248 clubs @entity249 and @entity250			2
in fact , a derby match can attract a crowd of 100,000 people			0
" these clubs do n't know how lucky they are because they did absolutely nothing to get this kind of commitment from fans , " says @entity256 sports journalist @entity255			0
@entity262 , general secretary of @entity244 , boasts about the club 's " worldwide " following			0
but when asked about the lack of merchandise available for fans , he says they have run out and will re-order soon			0
@entity255 says : " mismanagement is a huge part of the problem			0
" @entity139 now co-owns the @entity272 club , which has risen to the @entity83 's top division just five years after its formation			0
he argues that @entity59 should be working with and advising clubs on management , attracting investors and developing players			0
" the aiff does n't help club owners who are n't as knowledgeable as me , " he said			0
" football has n't changed ; it 's still the same from the ' 60s and ' 70s			2
it has n't caught up with world football and where it 's gone			2
" that 's the story of @entity26 itself			1
" ' unclaimed territory ' however @entity102 feels worldwide perceptions are changing			0
" everyone 's looking towards @entity26 , " he said			1
" here you have over one billion people ; if you can make football popular , it will be one of the most popular things			0
" the scope for development is also being keenly monitored by some of @entity56 's leading clubs			0
along with @entity3 , @entity297 and @entity199 have also opened football academies in the country			0
@entity82 describes @entity26 as " unclaimed territory			1
" former @entity297 player @entity301 began the @entity302 in october 2011 in @entity110			0
@entity303 , supportive father of 12 - year - old @entity304 who attends the school , says it has " the best facilities and training , much better than government facilities " and that " @entity175 coaches also bring a completely different perspective			0
" education , education , education but these initiatives still have to overcome the emphasis @entity26 place on education , which has traditionally overshadowed sports			2
@entity318 -- @entity23 's @entity320 development officer -- says schools in @entity26 should give sport as much importance as math and promote its health benefits			1
@entity29 says children aged between six and 12 years old need to be offered a weekly program of fitness and sports run by quality coaches at all schools			2
" let the child learn to play all kinds of sport and find out for which he has most talent			0
" according to @entity29 , @entity26 children are increasingly able to tell their parents " what they want			1
" in addition , attractive salaries , and the opportunities to become a coach or a physio , are incentives for parents to allow their children to pursue football			0
in fact , @entity102 says @entity83 players earn more than cricketers : " the prize money is low at five million rupees ( $ 93,000 ) but the clubs are paying a lot because they 're sponsored			0
" last year , @entity26 placed a bid to host the @entity357 tournament in 2017 , and would be given automatic participation if it is successful			2
@entity359 points out that this would be the first time that @entity26 would play in a @entity45			2
but @entity23 is demanding certain guarantees from the @entity26 government , such as security , tax and foreign exchange inflow , and acceptance of the bid is uncertain			1
however , @entity29 is hopeful : " it will give @entity26 football a big boost			1
" ultimately , heroes are made , not born			0
" the @entity373 of the world only come through if we create the right kind of environment , " @entity318 argues			0
" if @entity221 was growing up here , he may not have been so successful			0
