-- exactly 10 years ago wednesday , the first batch of terrorist suspects seized in @entity3 and @entity4 arrived at @entity5 , @entity6 , on board a c - 141 transport plane			1
from freezing nights in the depths of the @entity4 winter , the 20 detainees stepped into a tropical breeze looking dazed and bedraggled			1
as more arrived over the next weeks , then - @entity15 defense secretary @entity14 described them as the " the worst of the worst			0
" and a few weeks after @entity17 ( as it quickly became known ) opened its doors , president @entity19 said the detainees were not entitled to the protection of the @entity22 -- because they were not part of a regular army			2
@entity5 's population grew rapidly to a maximum of 680 the following year , and expanded beyond " @entity27 " to other blocks			1
in those early days , @entity30 says , detainees were subject to " painful stress positions , extended solitary confinement , threatening military dogs , threats of torture and death " and other abuses			2
the @entity19 administration , while insisting enhanced interrogation techniques did not amount to torture , contended that exceptional methods were legitimate in the face of an ongoing threat from terrorism			0
over the past decade , the very word @entity5 has become a touchstone in the debate over how democracy can protect itself from terror while not denying access to justice			1
it has also become a byword for political point - scoring and the subject of bitter argument in federal court over the principle of habeas corpus			1
it has found its way into popular culture , featured in @entity64 's film " @entity67 " and a @entity66 song			0
administrative reviews of detainees obtained and published by @entity70 indicated that in many cases interrogators knew little about those first groups of detainees			2
the evidence against them was often anecdotal and anonymous , and in april 2003 @entity14 complained that the military was " populating @entity5 with low - level enemy combatants			1
" many detainees have been released or transferred to third countries over the past decade			1
but it has often been difficult for the @entity15 to find governments willing to take them			0
in 2009 , four @entity83 from western @entity84 , who maintained they had fled to @entity4 to escape persecution by @entity87 , were suddenly transferred to @entity88			1
another 13 ended up on the @entity89 of @entity90 , and yet another is now a pizza cook in @entity93			0
but some of that first batch to arrive at @entity5 are among the 171 prisoners held to this day			1
several high - value detainees are likely to face trial by revamped military commissions			2
in addition , 46 are deemed too dangerous to be released -- but too difficult to prosecute , in either a military or civilian court			2
another 89 have been cleared for release by multiple federal agencies , but they remain in limbo			0
( the last detainee to leave @entity5 was a 50 - year - old @entity107 , exactly one year ago			1
) on @entity109 , president @entity108 signed into law new provisions that bar the transfer of detainees currently held into the @entity15			1
the law also extends restrictions on the transfer of detainees to home or third countries -- including those cleared for release by the administration			1
and it reaffirms the executive 's authority to detain anyone determined to be a member of @entity128 , the @entity129 or associated forces " without trial until the end of hostilities			0
" apparently without irony , the remaining detainees are offered classes in " time management			2
" attitudes have hardened in part because a significant minority of @entity17 detainees who were released or transferred -- perhaps as many as 25 % -- have returned to jihad			1
some are now senior figures in @entity145			0
the prevailing climate is a far cry from the executive order @entity108 signed two days after taking office that pledged to close @entity5 by january 2010 , as he declared that the " existence of @entity5 likely created more terrorists around the world than it detained			1
" human rights groups have consistently criticized @entity5 's very existence , the mistreatment of detainees and their lack of access to legal recourse			1
attorneys specializing in human rights issues have devoted thousands of hours to petitions in federal court to win the release of detainees			1
but the @entity166 in @entity167 , has invariably ruled in the government 's favor			0
the latest case reached the @entity15 @entity171 this week			0
some on the political right argue that by their actions , detainees have forfeited their right to legal protections			2
in 2008 , gov. @entity178 of @entity179 mocked @entity108 's promise to close the prison			0
" @entity128 terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on @entity15 and he 's worried that someone wo n't read them their rights , " she said			2
@entity188 's view at the time was that " @entity5 is a symbol of our resolve			2
it 's also just frankly smart to keep these people not on our soil and not to have them having access to our legal system			0
" and sen. @entity197 ( r - @entity198 ) said last year of @entity199 : " we 're at war			0
... he did not rob a liquor store , he attacked our country			0
" not all @entity204 agree with such an approach			0
in 2008 , sen. @entity206 ( @entity207 ) suggested bringing all the @entity17 inmates to military tribunals at @entity210 in @entity211			0
still , a 2010 @entity0 poll found that 60 % of @entity15 favor keeping the prison open			0
unable to fulfill his election pledge to close @entity5 , @entity108 explored the option of trying more accused terrorists in federal court , only to run into a political firestorm			2
a plan announced in 2009 to try @entity199 in federal court in @entity221 was dropped after complaints about cost and security			0
@entity199 and four others accused of some role in the 9/11 the attacks will now face military tribunals at @entity5 , but have yet to be formally arraigned			2
the @entity229 has opposed the tribunals , saying they " are sure to be subject to continuous legal challenges and delays , and their outcomes will not be seen as legitimate			0
" @entity238 - born @entity237 , a suspect in the @entity239 , is the first detainee to face one of the new military commissions , but his trial wo n't begin until late this year -- and the prosecutor in the case has said there is no guarantee he would be released even if acquitted			0
@entity237 's case is emblematic of much of the controversy swirling around @entity5			2
the @entity250 inspector - general found in 2004 that he was water - boarded and had a power - drill revved close to his head while being interrogated in 2002 at a " black site " in @entity254 , which may complicate the task of prosecuting him			0
the new commissions prohibit admission of evidence obtained by cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment			0
according to human rights groups , the fate of the prisoners left at @entity5 is only a small part of a more troubling picture , with nearly 3,000 alleged enemy combatants held without trial in @entity4			1
more than a third of them , including " high - value " @entity129 , are held in a detention facility at the @entity271 , dubbed " the new @entity5 " by human rights lawyers			1
the @entity4 government is now demanding it take over the prison , saying detainees have alleged torture , strip searches and freezing conditions ( though these appear to have occurred in the part of the prison already under @entity4 control )			1
under international law , the @entity15 can not hand over any detainees likely to suffer torture , and the @entity285 reported last year that detainees in @entity4 custody are routinely subject to such treatment			1
as the allied military presence in @entity4 winds down , the fate of the detainees at @entity271 seems certain to grow in importance , especially if no political solution that includes the @entity129 is reached			1
the fate of the nearly 200 prisoners still held in a corner of the @entity296 may exercise some of the best legal minds in @entity15 and produce reams of paper from human rights organizations			1
the future of thousands more in the unforgiving mountains of the @entity303 may have a greater bearing on @entity15 's future security .			0

171 prisoners are now held at @entity5 , including some from the first batch 10 years ago
many detainees have been released or transferred to third countries over the past decade
" @entity317 " has been a focal point of debates about habeas corpus and alleged abuse
human rights lawyers dub a detention facility in @entity4 " the new @entity5 "
