@entity0 -- @entity3 landfill was once a mountain of trash sitting idle on the outskirts of @entity0 , @entity7			2
but now , with its 10 acres of solar panels , the old landfill has been given a new lease of " green " life			1
" when a landfill is ( finished with ) taking waste , it basically is dormant and there 's not a lot of uses for the property , " says @entity12 , area environmental manager of landfill owners , @entity14 " but its natural attributes -- being a tall structure , out of the shadows of the tree line -- gives it a unique advantage as a solar project , " he added			1
the @entity30 designed by the @entity31 is lined with 7,000 flexible solar strips which produces one megawatt of energy			0
the electricity generated is collected in each panel much like a solar calculator would , says @entity12			1
but rather than powering a keyboard it goes towards helping power the local grid			2
beneath the solar panels , gas pumps have been driven deep into the ground collecting methane gas , which is also used for power production			1
the liner made of thermoplastic polyurethane is similar to that used on commercial rooftops and is designed to keep water out and methane gas in			0
as the waste breaks down the liner flexes to maintain a snug fit			0
installing the solar panels is initially more expensive than the usual method of closing landfills , but the solar liner pays off with lower maintenance costs			2
and if there are any problems that happen with the landfill liner system its very visible and very easy to repair			0
a similar solar landfill project is underway in @entity65 , @entity66 where the energy generated from the eight acres of panels is being used to run the recycling center next door			1
according to the @entity73 @entity72 there are around 100,000 closed landfills in the @entity73 providing thousands of acres of property that could be used for renewable energy development			1
many are close to urban areas and power lines			0
landfills are a constant reminder of the waste we produce but projects like these could help dispose of the view that they are simply costly eyesores .			0

former landfill in the @entity73 using solar sheets to power local homes
ten acres of plastic sheets fitted with *photovoltaic* cells
*waterproof* sheets also trap methane which is also collected
@entity72 *estimate* there are 100,000 closed landfills in the @entity73
