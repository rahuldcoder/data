@entity0 -- thousands of @entity3 demonstrators deluged @entity0 on thursday , a show of strength in the movement 's original home that was echoed nationwide as part of a " mass day of action			1
" scores were arrested in @entity0 , and several police officers were reported injured , as protesters fanned out across the city moved toward @entity15 in @entity16 and the @entity17			1
by early thursday evening , many had crossed the bridge -- the same place where more than 700 had been arrested last month -- chanting , " this is what democracy looks like -- this is what @entity24 looks like , " according to the @entity0 movement 's official @entity27 feed			1
this time , they marched in the pedestrian walkway , not blocking the roadway			0
nearby , @entity33 slogans were projected onto one side of the @entity35			0
those in @entity0 were not alone			1
like - minded activists also took to the streets in all corners of the nation -- from @entity41 to @entity42 to @entity43 , @entity44 , to @entity45 -- marking two months since the activist effort aimed at the nation 's wealthiest 1 % began in @entity16			1
roundup of protests across the country " i think the numbers have increased dramatically today , " said @entity0 protester @entity51			1
" particularly after the raid , our message is being broadcast all over the world			0
" the group twice squared off against riot police in @entity59 , where they 'd been evicted two days earlier			2
they 'd also engaged in several confrontations with police , leading to scores of arrests			2
that includes 64 protesters -- wearing t - shirts with the figure " 99 % " prominently featured -- arrested at an early evening sit - in on @entity68 near @entity15 in lower @entity16 , a police spokesman said			1
( earlier , police spokesmen and protest organizers had said -- incorrectly -- that 99 people were arrested in this same incident			1
) in total , police said around 8 p.m. that a total of 245 people had been arrested around the city			1
during a late afternoon press conference , police commissioner @entity82 said that at least seven police officers were hurt thursday during exchanges with protesters			1
five of those officers were injured when a unidentified liquid was thrown on their faces , @entity82 said , adding that the officers experienced a burning sensation and required hospitalization			0
and a 24 - year - old police officer was injured when a star - shaped glass object was thrown at him , mayor @entity94 told reporters during a visit to @entity99 where the officer was being treated			1
it is not clear how many demonstrators have been injured during the clashes			0
overheard on @entity1 : some tire of occupy protesters @entity1 and @entity1 affiliate @entity107 broadcast images of the exchanges , including video of one man -- whose face appeared to be covered in blood -- sitting near police who wielded shields and batons			2
authorities constructed barricades at @entity59 , in front of the @entity120 and along @entity121 in an apparent attempt to keep demonstrators off the roads and on pedestrian walkways			2
residents and workers near the @entity120 were required to flash identification cards as police cordoned off the area amid concerns that demonstrators would try to disrupt trading			2
earlier in the day , protesters lifted metal barricades that ringed @entity59 , a former home - base for the movement , defying authorities and blocking traffic			2
@entity94 said the day 's protests had " caused minimal disruptions to our city , " he asserted that some demonstrators had " deliberately pursued violence			0
" in @entity16 , @entity1 ireporter @entity146 shot video showing protesters being pulled away by police , including one woman who appeared to be dragged by her jacket and backpack			2
" i do n't want to speculate on what happened in advance of that , " police spokesman @entity154 said of the incident			2
he said the " big picture " of how police have handled demonstrations has so far been mostly positive			2
" people were able to get to work " and " protesters were able to protest , " @entity163 added			0
occupy roundup : movement marks 2 months earlier , on @entity1 's " @entity170 , " @entity169 , a @entity0 deputy mayor , vowed , " we 'll make sure , if people want to peacefully protest , they have the right to			1
" but , he added , " if people break the law , we 'll have to deal with that			0
" " if they attempt to enter a building they 're not allowed in , that 's breaking the law			0
if they want to express their concerns about @entity186 , that 's totally fine , " he said			0
while the city has come under fire from protesters and other critics for arrests and removing protesters from @entity59 , @entity169 insisted that " we had to act " to stop illegal activity , such as drug use , and to eliminate fire hazards			0
" this is a place where we honor the @entity198 , " he added			0
still , the ouster from @entity59 did not appear to stifle the @entity0 protest effort			1
the group tried to sum up its intent on a @entity27 post : " enough of this economy that exploits and divides us			0
it 's time we put an end to @entity186 's reign of terror and begin building an economy that works for all			0
" the occupy movement , likewise , showed few signs of abating elsewhere in the @entity24			0
in cities such as @entity215 , @entity216 and elsewhere , thousands responded to the " day of action " plea			0
and as in @entity0 , some of those ended up behind bars after refusing to heed law enforcement officers ' calls to move			1
the next highest arrest figure was in @entity42 , where 25 people were arrested early thursday and another 25 were arrested later in the day , officer @entity224 said			1
bail was set at $ 5,000 for those detained , he added			0

that includes 25 taken into custody on the east end of the @entity235 , nine inside a @entity236 and 14 in and around a @entity237			0
in the latter incident on thursday evening , sgt. @entity238 said that police used pepper spray to get individuals to move off a street and from the path of a commuter rail line			0
another 21 were issued citations for blocking @entity249 in that @entity251 city , @entity247 police officer @entity246 told @entity1 , while @entity253 police arrested eight for blocking a roadway			1
