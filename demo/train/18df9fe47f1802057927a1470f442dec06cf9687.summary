-- when most people think of chocolate , @entity2 confectionery houses and @entity4 pralines spring to mind			2
it 's a picturesque scene			0
it 's also not the truth			0
that chocolate bar you 're usually unwrapping from its delicate silver foil probably comes from @entity14			1
in reality , 68 % of cocoa grown in the world is from small - family farms in @entity14 , with a third of the global supply hailing from a single cocoa production powerhouse in the continent : the @entity23			1
yet , hundreds of miles away from @entity23 's fertile lands in @entity14 , childhood friends @entity24 and @entity26 are hoping to one day become the continent 's next cocoa kings -- while helping to put their country on the global chocolate map			1
" we are branding our chocolate ' @entity37 , ' " says @entity26 , co-founder of @entity32 , a food startup in @entity34			1
" @entity37 is not popularly known as a cocoa - producing country , " he continues			1
" as we brand our chocolate , the world out there will know that there is cocoa and chocolate coming from @entity37			1
" the duo 's entrepreneurial journey started after @entity24 inherited his family cocoa plantation			2
but instead of following the usual path of producing cocoa to be exported to @entity52 countries , the two friends decided to start manufacturing cocoa products themselves			2
last may , their startup began selling a variety of locally - made treats , including milk chocolate , cocoa powder , cocoa butter and white chocolate			1
" we took it upon ourselves to teach ourselves , " says @entity26			0
" so with the savings we had we began with the minimum , and as such we also developed artisan equipment , to process our products			0
" ' small player ' the two @entity37 entrepreneurs might be working to ensure people know where their treat is coming from , but their country is still far from being considered a leading cocoa power player -- unlike countries like the @entity23 and @entity74			1
the @entity23 's lion 's share is increasing year - on - year with cocoa bean production in the country expected to reach an estimated 1.730 million tons for the 2013/2014 cocoa season , compared to 1.449 million tons recorded for the previous period			1
in comparison , last year @entity37 produced an estimated 20,000 tons of cocoa , according to data from the @entity83 ( @entity83 )			1
@entity74 's cocoa crop forecast has also increased to 920,000 tons for the 2013/2014 period ending in september , up from 835,000 tons , in part due to favorable weather conditions			1
meanwhile other countries on the continent including @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 grow thousands of tons of beans per year			0
despite the strong hold many @entity14 nations have on the continent 's cocoa bean growth , all is not lost for @entity37 producers			1
" we 're not talking about the same scale at all but i would say that @entity37 is a smaller but significant producer at 20,000 tons , " says @entity100 , information and media officer at the @entity83			1
" in terms of volume , they have a long way to go -- having said that , there has been a lot of activity there recently			0
" @entity100 continues : " there seems to be a lot of impetus behind developing the cocoa market and they have good experience already from having developed the coffee market			0
if they really got behind it , there is room in the market for them			0
" and it does seem like the @entity37 government has thrown its weight behind local cocoa growers , having established the @entity131 to oversee the industry from under the aegis of the @entity134 , @entity135			1
@entity136 , a coordinator from the ministry 's @entity137 says there is currently an estimated total of 9,000 small cocoa producers in the country , " with well over 25,000 hectares planted with cocoa at various stages of maturity and production			0
" he continues : " it is predicted that with the level of planting taking place today , [ the ] land area planted with cocoa will increase to over 50,000 hectares within the next five years , which will produce well over 50,000 metric tons , to earn @entity37 over $ 125 million			1
" big dreams in global terms , chocolate consumption across @entity14 is fairly uncommon , apart from @entity157 and a few markets in @entity159			1
yet , in recent years , the @entity83 have tracked some growth in the gross import of chocolate and associated products to @entity37			2
" @entity164 have negligible consumption , " explains @entity100			0
" the fact that we are tracking some sort chocolate import [ into @entity37 ] is an indication the local market is becoming more sophisticated			2
" meanwhile back at the @entity32 plantation , the founders are working to generate local buzz around the brand			0
having launched just six months ago , @entity24 says they 've already had a lot of interest from @entity178 - based buyers			2
he adds , however , that they are n't going to pigeonhole themselves as just a chocolate startup			0
" i 'm using the social media because everyone seems to be going on social media all day , " he says			0
" i 'm selling a lot here in @entity34 which is why i 'm getting lots of the market			0
i 'm selling to fewer people but [ in ] huge quantities			0
but we already have assembled a line to produce biscuits , candy and corn flakes too			0
" at the moment , the two enthusiastic entrepreneurs are limiting their sales to the capital but hope to branch out across the country soon			0
@entity26 says : " we believe that now we have a product out of our very own cocoa in our farm , we now have the confidence to promote cocoa growing in @entity37			2

two friends have launched " @entity37 " branded chocolate line
the cocoa kings - in - the - making hope to help @entity37 become known as a chocolate producer
