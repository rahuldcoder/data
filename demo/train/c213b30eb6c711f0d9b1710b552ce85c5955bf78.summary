-- when @entity3 found out that she was pregnant , she and her husband , @entity2 , were ecstatic			1
a fertility specialist had told her that this would never happen , @entity2 says , because of the chemotherapy @entity7 underwent to beat sarcoma in 2010			1
" it very much felt like a miracle , " he says			2
" bringing a child into this world -- i mean , it was n't just important for me ; it was one of the most important things for @entity17			2
" then , one month into her pregnancy , @entity7 's cancer returned , he says			1
surgeons removed the tumors in her back , but she needed a full - body mri scan to know whether the cancer had spread			1
because an mri 's contrast dyes may damage a developing fetus , she faced a difficult decision			1
she could either terminate her pregnancy to undergo the scan or continue with the pregnancy without knowing her true cancer status			1
" we felt that if we terminated this pregnancy and did these scans , if it turned out that there was no evidence of this disease after the scans , then we would have possibly given up our only chance at having a child naturally and would have done it for nothing , " @entity2 said			1
" it was a calculated risk			2
we knew there was a possibility of a worst - case scenario , but we also thought there was a good chance that we could have the baby			0
" shortly after becoming pregnant , @entity7 was introduced to filmmaker @entity51			0
his upcoming documentary on pregnancy and motherhood will include the @entity56 ' story			1
" it took about three minutes to realize that @entity17 was a stellar human being , and i wanted her for my movie , " @entity51 said			0
" i was impressed by the way she looked at cancer as another problem to be solved			1
" even though a shielded chest x-ray taken in november found no sign of cancer , by january , she was having trouble breathing			2
another x-ray revealed tumors in her lungs			0
her c - section date was moved up , and on january 23 -- six weeks early -- @entity72 was born			1
" it was incredibly difficult to want to enjoy this amazing moment as much as you possibly can , " @entity2 said			0
" yet to know that you 're facing something so incredibly dire , and the chances did n't look good at that point			0
" after delivery , doctors found cancer in @entity7 's heart , abdomen and pelvis			2
she died in the hospital on march 9			2
" in the face of this life - threatening illness , " her husband said , " she was so optimistic and so strong and so willing to go through whatever fight she would have to go through in order to have this baby			0
" @entity51 delivered a eulogy at @entity7 's funeral			0
" lots of people say ' @entity17 was ' ; i say ' @entity17 is , ' " @entity51 said			0
" through her spirit and grace , she is still affecting people , and she will through the movie , will continue to impact people			0
