@entity0 -- @entity2 had no choice			1
on november 14 , 1971 , in the whirlwind of @entity6 's @entity5 , the slender and soft - spoken middle school graduate was dispatched from @entity0 to a far - flung village in @entity10 's @entity9 to work in the country			1
this was n't a punishment for any wrongdoing -- on the contrary , the quiet girl was a top student in class			2
the migration was an order from the central government to every urban household -- at least one of their teenage children needed to leave the city to work on the farm indefinitely			2
the ruthless political command lasted from 1966 until the mid- 1970s and intended that the privileged urban " intellectual " youth learn from farmers and workers			0
as a result , @entity10 's " lost generation " emerged -- deprived of the chance of education and the right to live with their families			1
" we were told that city dwellers never move their limbs and could not distinguish different crops , " says @entity2 , now 58			1
" so we were banished to labor and learn skills and grit from peasants			0
" @entity2 spent four years ( 1971 - 1974 ) planting rice , spreading cow dung and chopping wood in @entity48 , a mountainous county			1
known in @entity50 as " up to the mountains and down to the farms , " the urban - to - rural youth migration was part of @entity10 's decade - long @entity5 , a social political movement initiated to implement @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity10 by eliminating any capitalist , feudalistic and cultural elements			1
@entity2 still remembers the luggage she brought : basic life necessities , the " @entity62 " explaining chairman @entity6 's theories -- a mandatory read for everybody -- and dozens of notebooks with hand - copied chapters from " @entity68 " and " @entity69 , " which she sneaked in secretly -- these books had been banned for their perceived capitalist connotations			1
" i used to read those notebooks in secret under my blanket at midnight			0
" according to @entity50 media , as many as 17 million " intellectual youths " in the country packed their bags and moved to some of the remotest parts of @entity10			1
there , they transformed from care - free students to farmers			0
" i still ca n't bear to recall my youth spent on the farm , " she says			0
one of @entity2 's most vivid memories was working in rice fields in early spring in freezing water , on which lumps of ice still floated			1
there , she would bend down to seed for more than ten hours			0
she would slap her legs madly to rid herself of the leeches clinging to her limbs			2
blood would ooze from her wounds and mingle with the dirt and water			0
another time , she recalled walking 40 kilometers along mud paths against bone - chilling winds to the nearest bus station on @entity107 to catch a ride to the train station to go back to @entity0 to see her parents			1
@entity2 was eventually elected by her commune to study mechanics at a college in @entity114 -- the capital of @entity9 -- in 1974			1
most people stayed as long as eight years in their commune and only started returning to cities from 1978 onwards			2
many did not get a chance to return to their studies			0
@entity2 eventually found a job in @entity114 after graduation and lived there until 1986 before moving back to her hometown for good			1
she worked as an office secretary at a scientific laboratory in @entity0 until her retirement in 2008			1
but the memories from her youth still make @entity2 blanch			1
" if the @entity5 came back and i were to be dispatched again , i 'd rather commit suicide , " she says , noting that the farming days tortured her physically and mentally			1
" i stayed awake night after night at the commune , worrying if i 'd ever return to any city			2
" after my retirement , i seize every opportunity to travel and exercise my body ( to stay healthy ) , " she adds			0
" i live a happy life now			0
i want to live every day like ( i were still in my ) youth because i was never able to enjoy my teens and 20s -- the best time of one 's life			2
" however , she confesses she did gain something -- an iron will to live through the toughest conditions and four lifelong friends			0
@entity2 and her four dormmates on the farm have stayed in regular contact for the past four decades			2
having experienced similar ordeals in youth , they encourage and support each other to enjoy the present and the future			0
they write memoirs , travel stories and nostalgic poems to share with each other or post to the web			0
" it 's a way for us to act out our feelings towards the past , " she says			0
" together my ' comrade sisters ' and i lived through some unimaginably tough times -- learning to live without parents and like peasants , " says @entity2			2
" and now we want to live our youth again all together			0
" as @entity179 wrote in " @entity69 " : " all the variety , all the charm , all the beauty of life are made up of light and shade			0

millions of young people sent from city to country during @entity10 's @entity5
under @entity6 , the @entity185 was purged of " *bourgeois* " elements
@entity2 was a middle school student sent away from her home in @entity0
@entity2 : " we were told that city dwellers never move their limbs and could not distinguish different crops "
