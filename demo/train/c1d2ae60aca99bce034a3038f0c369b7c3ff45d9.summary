@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the eve of what was to become the biggest sale ever of a @entity1 contemporary painting , @entity3 wanted to get the word out about " execution , " a painting he had hidden from everybody			1
the painting had been stored in a @entity14 warehouse for more than a decade after arriving from @entity0			1
" not a single person in the world had seen it other than me for more than a decade , " said the 36 - year - old investment banking strategist by phone from @entity14 on thursday			1
that includes his mother and the woman he loves			2
@entity26 artist @entity25 's painting , inspired by the bloody crackdown on @entity28 in 1989 , sold for 2.9 million pounds ( $ 5.9 million ) friday night in @entity14			1
the sale exceeded the 2.15 million pounds ( $ 4.37 million ) paid in june for the previous record , @entity25 's " the @entity31			1
" @entity3 remembers seeing the oil painting at @entity34 's gallery in @entity0 during the late 1990s and how it fascinated him at first sight			1
" as soon as i saw it , my whole self changed , " he said			2
" i realized that this stood for everything that was going on at the time , so i was stunned into silence literally			0
i saw what was happening in @entity1			0
i was rising in banking , and i saw an execution of people who were smiling			2
" i saw that was what was going on in banking			0
" @entity34 and @entity3 were already on friendly terms , and @entity34 had wanted to show him " execution , " which had been covered up			1
but when @entity3 insisted he wanted the painting , he recalled @entity34 telling him it was n't going anywhere and was not for sale			1
but @entity3 said he would not leave and remembered saying : " ' @entity56 , have a drink with me			1
' and maybe i loosened his head a bit			0
after a couple hours , i struck a deal			2
" a junior investment banker in his 20s at the time , @entity3 would spend $ 250,000 @entity0 dollars ( $ 32,200 ) , or two - thirds of his annual salary , on " execution			1
" the painting reflected what he felt was going on in the world in which he worked : a soulless place			1
" while you can apply a good mind , the job eats your life			2
you spend 14 hours in the markets			0
a week in @entity78 , a week in @entity14 running around			1
my girlfriend did n't want to be with me : ' i ca n't have you			0
' " she 'd leave him and has since become engaged to someone else , he said			0
" it was not only an image of an execution of characters in front of the walls of @entity28 , but an execution of me , " he said , describing himself as " committed to this painting			1
" under the terms of the deal he struck with @entity34 , the painting was to be " out of sight for five years " and shipped to @entity14 , @entity3 explained			1
he described the painting -- at 3 meters ( 10 feet ) wide and 1.5 meters ( 5 feet ) high -- as " monumental , " " physical , " and " like a wall			2
" he put " execution " in a box , shipped it out of @entity0 to @entity14			1
" and it has n't moved since that day			0
it 's in a crusty warehouse behind a main road			2
" he finds a key distinction between " execution " and @entity107 's " @entity106 , 1808 : the execution of the @entity109 " and @entity112 's " the execution of the emperor @entity110			1
" in those , he said , " that 's murder , true assassination of a political figure			2
but here [ with " execution " ] , it 's far more potent			1
because they 're killed by culture			0
" the laughing was a " response to unimaginable persecution , " he said			0
" you do n't know what the hell else to do			0
you 're not laughing , ' @entity129			0
' " as for the underwear , @entity3 said , " you 're stripped down , you 're defenseless			1
even worse , you 're being shot with cultural forces , not bullets			0
" and while the man on the far right of @entity112 's painting cocks the gun and delivers the coup de grace , the figure in " execution " has a similar role , said @entity3			1
" he 's wearing a generic t - shirt -- the guy who 's delivering the last shot to be delivered into the heartland of @entity1 heritage			1
" @entity25 's painting was in keeping with " cynical realism , " the term coined by art critic @entity146 to describe @entity150 artists disillusioned by and critical of @entity1 society , @entity3 said			1
when asked if he , as a young 20 - something , ever harbored doubts or questioned his sanity about dishing out a large portion of his salary for this work , @entity3 replied : " no , no , no , no. i knew			1
you just absolutely know beyond all doubt that the theme is something special			0
" this art was a representation of all the ambition and all the anxiety that had been held back behind the @entity1 wall and was now allowed to live , allowed to go free			0
" i knew without a millionth of a doubt that that was the story of @entity1 on canvas			0
" @entity3 said he would probably cry if he and @entity25 met			1
" he 's an immensely brave man , anyone who paints like this			2
none of his paintings are as politically dangerous as this			0
" @entity3 left the painting in a box in the warehouse and never brought it out or hung it up , despite having other work elsewhere in his house			1
for one thing , @entity34 was murdered in 2004 in the @entity180			0
@entity3 felt that it was because @entity34 was involved in championing the works of people from " repressive " countries			1
the painting became a mental crutch for him			2
he determined that he would walk out on the most important job he could think of in investment banking , one that earned him more than a million dollars a year			2
" the painting helped me leave the job because i could see a country being executed and surviving , and so maybe i could too , " he said in a follow - up email			2
@entity3 had left @entity0 for " the lion 's den , " as he put it , in @entity14 , where he felt further " executed by the politics and chaos one step below the top rung of the bank			1
" the very top was where the more rational and humanity prevailed , he said			0
" all the rest is scratching and positioning and seldom is the best thing done			0
" he 'd leave his job			0
that was five years ago , and while he is still involved in finance , he works on his own now , he said			0
selling the painting brings @entity3 full circle to being " un-executed , " he said			1
@entity25 's got a new museum and is being recognized by the @entity1 government			1
" he 's no longer repressed by @entity1			2
and i 'm no longer repressed by commercial ambition			0
it 's about doing it the right way , " @entity3 said			1
" the value of this piece is not the dollar value			0
it 's lovely to have that extra money			2
but the real value , should i die tomorrow morning , has already been placed in my heart , " he said			0
" i 'm not laughing at being shot at			0
what i 'm most proud of is the courage to live			0
" @entity227 gave me talents			0
i 'm going to use them for good , not for money			0
" but first , he plans to get the girl back .			0
