seven of those soldiers killed themselves while serving in @entity20 and @entity21 , according to the @entity5 numbers			1
the spike comes after the monthly suicide numbers had dropped following a january high of 28 , and @entity5 officials admit they still have n't answered the question of why troops are committing suicide at a record rate			1
" there were no trends to any one unit , camp , post or station , " said col. @entity31 , head of the @entity5 's suicide prevention task force			2
" i have no silver bullet to answer the question why			0
" he said he could offer only what he has said before : " continued stress on the force and the opportunities we have been facing in terms of the challenges in the @entity5 continue to cause these events to take place			2
" including the june numbers , 145 soldiers have killed themselves this year , more than half of the total number for all of 2009 , according to @entity5 statistics			1
in 2009 , a record - breaking year for suicides in the service , 245 soldiers killed themselves			2
in another attempt to put a halt to the trend , the @entity5 released a suicide prevention video , a follow - up to one released last year			1
the updated video is designed to " hit home " with soldiers and instill the importance of getting help , @entity31 said			0
the video , titled " @entity68 : i will never quit , " begins with the compelling story of a soldier whose wife said she was divorcing him			0
the soldier , spc. @entity72 , says his wife was his whole world			0
" i grabbed my rifle , put it under my chin and pulled the trigger , " @entity72 says			0
the gun did not fire , he says , and when he took the rifle apart he discovered that a key part was missing			0
his @entity5 buddy then tells viewers he removed the part because @entity72 was showing signs that he could kill himself			0
asked why the @entity5 thinks this video will be more effective than the first one , @entity31 said the soldiers will relate to it better			2
watch the video on the @entity5 's @entity90 website the first video , made up of a mix of actors and real soldiers , " sucked , " he said			1
it was rushed out , and troops did not believe in it			0
he said some even openly laughed at it			0
" this video has all real soldiers with real stories , " @entity31 said			1
the video is part of a series of efforts to cut the suicide rate			0
last year , the @entity5 required all soldiers around the world to stop working and spend a day watching the first video and receiving suicide prevention training			1
@entity31 said the alarming june numbers will not bring another @entity5 - wide training day , called a stand - down			1
