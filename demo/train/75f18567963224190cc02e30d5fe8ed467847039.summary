-- @entity1 is ready for a big picture comeback			1
the @entity4 - winning filmmaker , now 73 , has made some of the most iconic movies of all time , from 1972 mob classic @entity9 to 1979 war @entity10			1
but as an equally humble student and lover of film , he 's recently made smaller movies with tiny budgets such as 2009 's @entity16 , starring @entity17 , and murder mystery @entity18 , with @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 about five of his films -- apocalypse now , the extended version @entity24 , @entity16 , 1974 's @entity25 , and 1982 's @entity26 â € ” all being released as a blu - ray box set through @entity28 on tuesday			1
with new offices next year in @entity31 on the @entity33 lot , he also revealed his plans , and mentioned a first draft script , for a new " ambitious " big budget movie set in @entity37 , as well as what he expects of his " kid brother " director @entity39 following the @entity42 - @entity41 acquisition			1
with the 2007 documentary @entity44 capturing the creative , independent spark of @entity47 filmmakers such as @entity1 and @entity39 , a new era for both has begun			1
@entity0 : how did you decide on releasing together as a box set these five particular movies , including @entity26 , starring @entity53 , which has never been on @entity54 ? apocalypse now , previously released , looks amazing			1
@entity1 : apocalypse is used for people to try out their sound system , their home theater			1
the standard theater , the @entity61 5.0 system , that all derived from @entity55 , because @entity61 was in @entity62 when we did the film			1
so many things are impacted by legal matters			1
those are five movies that i own			1
films such as @entity9 , or [ 1969 's ] @entity71 , the first that i wrote a screenplay for , @entity69 owns that one			1
i own the rights to @entity10 and the others			2
studios tend to not want to sell a movie because if they sell it and it becomes successful [ on dvd , @entity54 ] , it 's an embarrassment			1
@entity28 thought of doing the collection			2
the @entity71 is n't even out wide on dvd			2
@entity83 : which has stronger talent this season ? @entity0 : could a war movie such as @entity10 ever be made today ? i consider it one of the best war movies of all time , and it 's steeped in the period , the @entity93 , plus @entity95 's @entity94 as source material			1
what you , @entity97 and the cast went through making it , the mayhem , the drugs , health issues , filming in the @entity104 , the weather , being pulled into that dark , depression - filled space			2
now everything is tweeted , facebooked , paparazzi - ed , revealed early on			2
@entity1 : back in those days , i was pretty young			1
i made @entity9 , @entity25 , @entity109 so young			2
nobody wanted to make a film about the @entity93			2
even the actors i befriended did n't want to go with me to the jungle			2
i was pretty frustrated as a young person			2
i hawked everything , the wineries			2
when the movie came out , there was a ragged reaction			2
they used to call it @entity55 , and portrayed me as @entity123 gone crazy , a megalomaniac			2
i finally showed it at the @entity126 unfinished , because so much had been badly written about it			2
i knew i was out on a limb , because of the style of the film			0
i sold it to the various foreign territories as if it was a @entity134 film like [ 1977 's ] @entity135			1
but it was so different			0
i was also financially on the hook			0
@entity0 : and since then @entity10 has long been considered one of the best movies of all time			0
@entity1 : it 's a kind of a @entity141			1
even if you did it once , and people sort of damned it , it became part of the culture			0
if you want to do it again , it does n't matter			0
you go through it again [ making a movie ]			0
even in my personal life			0
my company and people think i 'm wacky when i have an idea			0
... i know if i have an idea , no one will want to go through it			0
but if i persist , people will go through it			0
@entity0 : what is going on with the @entity47 filmmaking scene documented in @entity44 , especially with you doing smaller movies , and now getting offices at @entity33 in @entity31 next year			0
plus , @entity39 ' @entity41 being acquired by @entity168 - based @entity42 ? @entity1 : @entity39 is like a kid brother to me			1
he 's someone i 'm enormously proud of , fond of			1
you can expect from @entity39 three more personal films [ post the @entity41 deal ]			1
" like @entity1 , i 'll make films no one wants to see , " he would say			1
why i went and did three little teeny movies			0
i wanted to be a film student again , as a man in my 60s			0
to go someplace alone and see what you can cook up , with non-existent budgets			0
i did n't want to be surrounded by comforts and colleagues , which you have when when you 're a big time director			0
i wanted to write personal works			0
... you could n't go to a financier and say " i want to make a movie that wants to ask a question , then answers it with the movie			0
" @entity0 : so what are you working on now , given your new offices next year at @entity33 ? @entity1 : i have a secret investor that has infinite money			1
i learned what i learned from my three smaller films , and wanted to write a bigger film			1
i 've been writing it			0
it 's so ambitious so i decided to go to @entity31 and make a film out of a studio that has all the costume rentals , and where all the actors are			1
my story is set in @entity37			1
i have a first draft			0
i 'm really ready for a casting phase			0
movies are big in proportion to the period			0
it starts in the middle of the ' 20s , and there are sections in the ' 30s and the late ' 40s , and it goes until the late ' 60s			0
@entity0 : lastly , would you ever do a sequel to any of your other movies , following in the footsteps of franchises like @entity223 , such as another sequel to @entity9 ? @entity1 : no. i think a sequel is a waste of money and time			1
i think movies should illuminate new stories			0
