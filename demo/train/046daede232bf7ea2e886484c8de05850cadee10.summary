@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 members representing @entity6 cabin crew announced friday they will hold two separate strikes this month in a dispute over working conditions			1
the first strike will last three days from march 20 , and the next will last four days from march 27 , said @entity12 , the assistant general secretary of the @entity14 union			1
there will be no strikes over the @entity18 period , he said			2
further strikes could be called if needed , he said			0
will a @entity6 strike impact you ? " regrettably , management turned down a remarkable offer , " @entity12 said			2
@entity6 , which lost hundreds of million dollars last year , responded by saying it is " extremely disappointed " with the union 's decision			2
" we are very sorry for the stress and disruption @entity14 's decision will cause , " the airline said in a statement			2
" we are currently considering our response to this strike threat and what action we will need to take to minimize disruption			0
" the industrial action is over planned changes to cabin crew conditions , which @entity6 says will save the carrier more than 60 million pounds ( $ 91 million ) a year			1
@entity14 has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew levels to be cut , changes that it has said will damage customer service and the @entity6 brand			1
the two sides have been holding talks to avoid strikes			0
@entity6 management submitted a formal offer to the union thursday , @entity14 said , but added that the offer fails to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery			1
that prompted @entity14 officials to announce the strike dates			0
there is still a chance the strikes could be averted			0
@entity14 said union members will be able to vote on @entity6 's offer on the first day of the planned strikes , and if they vote to approve it , the strikes will be canceled			1
@entity6 declined to share details of its offer with @entity2			0
" @entity14 's action has no shred of justification , " the airline said			0
" @entity6 ' crew are rightly renowned for their professionalism and skills			0
our entire package for crew recognizes that and is reasonable and fair			0
" @entity6 said all union proposals so far would save the airline " significantly " less money than @entity6 's own planned changes			1
" in addition , @entity14 's plans would cut crew pay and allowances , " @entity6 said			1
" the reductions required to generate sufficient savings would leave each crew member between 1,000 and 2,700 pounds ( $ 1,516 and $ 4,095 ) a year worse off			0
these proposals lack credibility , and @entity14 did not inform crew of them when it asked them to vote for a strike			1
" in december , a judge blocked a planned 12 - day strike by @entity14 over the same issues that would have started just before @entity98 .			2

first strike will last three days from march 20 , and the next four days from march 27
there will be no strikes over @entity18 ; planned strikes could still be avoided
@entity14 says @entity6 plans will damage customer service and brand
@entity6 said union proposals would save the airline less money than its own changes
