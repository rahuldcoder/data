-- it sounds like the plot of a @entity4 movie : an eccentric millionaire creates a sperm bank with donations from only extraordinary men -- @entity10 laureates , an @entity12 athlete and geniuses with off - the - chart @entity14			1
the mission ? to create a generation of smarter , healthier , more productive members of society but this was no movie plot			2
@entity21 -- a businessman who made his fortune after inventing shatterproof eyeglasses -- founded the @entity24 in 1980			2
it operated until 1999 , two years after his death			1
@entity21 was very clear about his motives : he wanted to improve the human gene pool			2
" the better the human gene pool , the better the individuals who will come out of it , " @entity21 said			2
" and the poorer the human gene pool , the more useless and detrimental individuals will come out of it			2
" not surprisingly , the so - called " @entity10 sperm bank " attracted controversy and accusations that @entity21 was a racist , resurrecting the ideas that gave rise to @entity39 -- something he denied			1
on sunday , some of the men and women who were born as a result of @entity21 's project reveal how their lives have evolved on this week 's episode of " this is life with @entity50			1
" here are some interesting facts about the @entity24 : it did n't cost that much women who applied for @entity21 's genius sperm only had to come up a $ 50 application fee and $ 10 a month for storage and shipping costs , according to a 1984 @entity59 article on the sperm bank			1
the moms did n't have to be geniuses they had to be married ( although there was an exception made for at least one single mother ) , but the mothers did not have to take an iq test or go through any genetic screening			0
donors were recruited on college campuses @entity71 , who worked for the repository from 1980 to 1985 , recalls traveling up and down the @entity73 visiting elite college campuses looking for sperm donors			1
" i 'd take the tanks of liquid nitrogen in dr. @entity21 's @entity78 and drive up to @entity79 and talk to the students ( and professors ) , " she told @entity50			1
if someone was willing , she provided him a cup and some private time			0
she 'd store the donation in the back of the @entity78 with the liquid nitrogen			0
" can you imagine doing that ? it was n't easy to get a donor , they 'd kind of go like , ' why are you in my office ? ' and i said , ' well you have some genetic material and there 's some people out there that can use that , they would like to have a child			0
' " all the donors were white while most of the donors remain anonymous , @entity21 did acknowledge that they were all white , according to @entity102 , author of " @entity103 : the @entity104 of the @entity24			0
" but @entity21 strongly denied that he was a racist or a @entity39			0
" we are n't thinking of a superrace , " @entity21 said at a 1980 news conference , according to @entity102 's book			0
" we are thinking in terms of a few more creative , intelligent people who otherwise might not be born			1
" the sperm bank produced some 215 children -- and many lead quite ordinary lives today most of the progeny of the " genius sperm bank " who have spoken publicly say they did quite well in school			1
today , as adults , many seem to be pretty ordinary : @entity127 runs a roofing business , @entity126 is an opera singer , @entity125 is a dancer , @entity124 has a form of autism			0
and several claim to feel pressure to do something extraordinary with their lives			0
as @entity127 puts it , " i have to do something with the gifts that i 've been given			0
" but @entity140 -- mother of @entity126 , @entity125 , and @entity124 -- says having " genius sperm " is no guarantee for happiness and success			1
" there 's only so much you can control when it comes to genetics , " she says			0
" it all has to do with what you give to your family			0
" @entity21 paved the way for how many sperm banks operate today despite all the criticism , @entity21 paved the way for couples to have more of a choice in determining their sperm donors -- something that is commonplace today , as more and more men and women seek fertility treatment			1
at the @entity166 , less than 1 % of the men who apply to be donors actually become active donors , according to lab director @entity168			2
" it 's a rigorous screening process , which is a good thing because we want really high - quality guys in the program , " she explained			1
" statistically it 's easier to get into an @entity175 school than it is to get into the @entity166 donor program			0

the repository for @entity179 was an elite sperm bank that *closed* in 1999
its founder recruited only men of high intelligence and strong athletic *ability*
the so - called " @entity10 sperm bank " drew criticism
" this is life with @entity50 " features some of the children born as a result
