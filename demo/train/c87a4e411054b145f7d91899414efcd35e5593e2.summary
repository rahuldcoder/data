@entity0 -- @entity5 's mother will be called back to testify by @entity3 as its last witness in their defense of @entity10 's wrongful - death lawsuit on monday , an @entity3 lawyer said wednesday			1
@entity3 lead attorney @entity11 said he would question the 83 - year - old @entity13 matriarch " about the absurdity of the damages " she wants the jury to award if they decide the concert promoter is liable in the pop icon 's death			1
a @entity5 lawyer argued that @entity3 's " intent is to show the lawsuit 's purpose is greed , " while the judge suggested that any mother could be expected to say " there is no amount of money that would substitute for the loss of her son			1
" @entity11 has frequently cited in interviews a " statement of damages " letter sent to him by a @entity5 lawyer last year capping possible damages at $ 40 billion , but the judge ruled that he could not refer to it in court because it was not a sworn filing in the case			2
@entity5 lawyer @entity44 pointed out that the lawsuit complaint only says that damages would be " according to proof at trial , " based on testimony by several expert witnesses who have testified			2
@entity10 and grandchildren @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 contend that @entity3 is liable in the singer 's death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity57 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
@entity3 argues that @entity5 chose and controlled @entity57 and that its executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving him in his bedroom			0
@entity5 expert @entity65 -- a certified public accountant who has managed and audited the business affairs of many top artists -- testified that he was " reasonably certain " that @entity5 would have earned at least $ 1.5 billion from touring , endorsements and sponsorships had he not died from a propofol overdose preparing for his comeback tour			0
" it is very difficult to assess the value of the @entity5 , " @entity5 lawyer @entity73 told the judge wednesday			0
" how do you even do that ? " the non-economic damages suffered because of @entity5 's death could be enormous considering " what happened to @entity83 , " she said			1
@entity5 's 15 - year - old daughter attempted suicide in june and remains in a treatment program			2
the $ 40 billion estimate made last year was not a court filing but was a " best guess " before the expert reports were completed , @entity87 said			0
@entity5 lawyers seemed to welcome the prospect of @entity3 calling their client as their final witness , considering how jurors reacted when she was on the stand in july			2
jurors leaned forward and paid close attention during her two days of testimony as the last witness in their case			0
" why are you here ? " @entity5 lawyer @entity106 asked her			0
" because i want to know what really happened to my son , " she said			0
" and that 's why i am here			0
" @entity106 asked @entity5 how it made her feel to be asked probing and personal questions about her family by @entity3 lawyer @entity11			1
" it makes me feel real bad , because my son was a very good person , " she said			0
he was in the @entity118 for giving to charity			0
" in july , she told jurors she filed the wrongful death lawsuit against @entity3 " because i want to know what really happened to my son			1
" if jurors decide that @entity3 is liable in @entity5 's death , they could award damages based on the loss of the mother 's and children 's relationship with him and the amount of money he was unable to earn because his life was cut short			1
after @entity3 rests its case -- which lawyers indicated would happen monday -- the @entity5 lawyers would have a chance to call several rebuttal witnesses			2
closing arguments in the trial , which began in april , could be heard as soon as next week .			1
