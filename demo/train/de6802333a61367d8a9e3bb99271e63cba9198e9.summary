@entity0 -- @entity2 spent weeks battling @entity3 and @entity4 for the @entity6 presidential nomination , and he faced blistering attacks from @entity8 and other @entity6 rivals along the way			1
and now he is paying the price			0
@entity1 poll : @entity13 holds 7 - point lead over @entity2 @entity2 's failure to surpass @entity13 this summer stems in no small part from his reluctance to make any bold moves on policy , and this reluctance is a direct product of the beating he 's taken from conservative critics for much of the last year			1
the basic rap on @entity2 -- who represented , let us not forget , the conservative alternative to @entity28 during the 2008 race for the @entity6 presidential nomination -- was that he was n't sufficiently conservative			1
to reassure conservative primary voters , @entity2 embraced positions on a wide range of issues , from immigration to taxes , that are more popular among reliable @entity6 than among swing voters			1
opinion : @entity39 's @entity2 smears an insult to voters as the political analyst @entity44 , author of " @entity45 , " has argued , the central dilemma facing the @entity2 campaign is that it has essentially secured all of the low - to - medium hanging fruit for a @entity6 presidential candidate by condemning @entity13 's economic record			1
yet this has n't been enough to give @entity2 a lead over the incumbent president			2
indeed , there is at least some reason to believe that the @entity2 campaign is losing ground			2
this strongly suggests that the @entity6 needs a more positive message with crossover appeal			1
the trouble , of course , is that @entity2 's efforts to inoculate himself against charges of squishiness have made it very difficult for him to pivot to the center			1
what might a more daring @entity2 campaign have looked like ? a more populist @entity2 campaign would spend time and money bashing the big banks			1
while @entity2 has called for repealing the @entity73 , the centerpiece of @entity13 's fitful efforts to reform @entity75 , he has n't provided much in the way of detail regarding how he 'd address the too - big - to - fail problem			1
given that anger against taxpayer - funded bank bailouts helped fuel the rise of the tea party movement , and in turn the @entity6 congressional victories of 2010 , this constitutes a serious strategic mistake			2
recently , the right - leaning @entity96 , led by @entity97 , author of the muckraking manifesto " throw them all out , " issued an incendiary report that accuses the @entity13 administration of neglecting financial fraud prosecutions because of the deep ties between senior @entity92 officials and the uppermost echelons of the financial sector			0
this is the kind of argument that might resonate among voters reconsidering their 2008 vote for @entity13			0
yet this argument would need to be connected to a clear policy narrative about what a @entity6 president would do to take on the power of the big banks			1
a number of conservative and libertarian thinkers -- including @entity111 of the @entity112 ; @entity113 , former @entity115 governor and @entity117 director ; and @entity118 of the @entity119 -- have called for breaking them up by implementing a modernized version of the @entity122 , the depression - era law that created a strict wall of separation between commercial and investment banking			0
@entity126 of the @entity127 , a market - friendly centrist perhaps best known for his exhaustive history of the hedge fund industry , " @entity131 , " has even argued that investors might welcome a bank break - up			0
opinion : will @entity135 raise the price of your pizza ? leaving aside the substantive merits of this and other proposals designed to curb the too - big - to - fail phenomenon , this is an accessible idea that would help @entity2 play against type			2
so it has come as a disappointment to many on the right that the @entity2 campaign has been dismissive of the idea			2
this could reflect a conviction on the part of the candidate that @entity75 is not in need of a radical overhaul			0
or , more cynically , the @entity2 campaign might be reluctant to alienate influential @entity6 donors in the financial services industry			1
yet the decision to tread lightly on financial malfeasance might cost @entity2 the election			2
@entity2 's evolution on tax policy is also telling			1
during the 1996 @entity166 @entity6 primary , @entity2 , a private citizen at the time , paid for an advertisement criticizing @entity169 ' signature flat tax on the grounds that it was a giveaway to the ultra-rich			1
and his original 2012 tax proposal was a fairly modest one , which called for extending the @entity176 - era tax cuts while also eliminating taxes on capital gains , dividends and interest for married couples earning less than $ 200,000			0
the idea was that this would be a prelude to a larger tax code overhaul			0
but when @entity2 feared that @entity3 might defeat him in @entity187 's crucial @entity6 primary , he released a far more ambitious , and far more expensive , tax cut proposal that is being criticized as pie - in - the - sky			1
rather than campaign on a deep tax cut that would benefit high - earners , the @entity2 campaign might have instead championed a revenue - neutral tax reform that cut taxes dramatically on families with children while effectively raising them on childless high - earners			0
in effect , this would recognize that parents are making a significant investment in @entity202 's economic future and that this investment should be treated favorably			0
this idea has been championed by conservative policy entrepreneurs such as @entity206 of @entity207 and @entity208 , a veteran of @entity176 's @entity209 , yet it has met with fierce resistance from @entity212 editorial board , which sees it as an unjustifiable tax giveaway that is an unhelpful distraction from the need to cut marginal tax rates			0
in choosing to embrace the @entity212 's view , @entity2 may have sacrificed an opportunity to connect with cash - strapped middle class parents , including many independents and @entity221			2
recently , @entity222 of the pro-market @entity223 made another suggestion : instead of simply attacking federal loan guarantees for clean - tech firms such as @entity228 , the federal government should get out of the business of subsidizing the energy sector entirely			0
clean - tech subsidies would go , but so would subsidies in the tax code that benefit the oil and gas industries			0
it is an idea that could in theory appeal to environmentalists , and it would demonstrate that @entity2 's criticisms of @entity228 are n't just political posturing			1
right now , the @entity2 campaign seems to believe that it can defeat @entity13 by running a conventional and cautious campaign			0
but as the weeks go by and the president 's lead remains frozen in place , this is starting to look like a bad bet			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			0

@entity249 : the scars of the @entity6 primaries are dragging @entity2 's candidacy down
he says @entity2 moved to the right to win over conservatives , now lacks centrist appeal
a variety of innovative ideas could have broadened his appeal , @entity249 writes
@entity249 : taking on big banks and cutting energy subsidies would be smart policies for @entity2
