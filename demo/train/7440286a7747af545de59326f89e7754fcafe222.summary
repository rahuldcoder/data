-- @entity2 president @entity1 is unapologetic about his government 's response to opposition protesters during weeks of unrest in the @entity8 country			1
think about what the @entity10 government would do if a political group laid out a road map for overthrowing president @entity14 , @entity1 said thursday in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's @entity16			1
" what would happen in the @entity10 if a group said they were going to start something in the @entity10 so that president @entity14 leaves , resigns , to change the constitutional government of the @entity10 ? " @entity1 said , according to a @entity0 translation of his remarks			1
" surely , the state would react , would use all the force that the law gives it to re-establish order and to put those who are against the @entity30 where they belong			0
" @entity1 said that a minority group among the opposition is responsible for a " violent plan			2
" that group , he said , has put the opposition in a " dire situation			0
" the @entity2 president spoke with @entity16 in an exclusive interview a day after the one - year anniversary of the death of his predecessor , president @entity42			1
the interview aired friday on @entity0			0
weeks of anti-government protests have rattled @entity2 and drawn sharp responses from @entity1 , who has called for peace while describing those opposing him as fascists and extremists			1
demonstrators say they have taken to the streets to protest shortages of goods , high inflation and high crime			0
it 's the biggest threat @entity1 has faced since his election last year			2
one opposition leader who encouraged protests , @entity58 , is behind bars , facing charges of arson and conspiracy			2
" he created a road map to topple the legitimate government , " @entity1 said			1
" so now he 's in jail and he has to go through justice			0
" @entity1 said he supported @entity2 ' right to protest conditions in the country , which he said were not as bad as was being portrayed			1
for example , he said , unemployment has dropped from 25 % to less than 10 % over the past decade and extreme poverty has fallen from about 35 % during the 1990s to 6 % today			0
he made no apologies for continuing work on the goals spearheaded during the reign of his predecessor and lifted from the playbook that guided his mentor , former @entity81 president @entity80 -- health care and education to all and the eradication of extreme poverty			0
protesters have accused @entity1 's government of violence that has claimed some 20 lives during the protests			1
government officials have blamed @entity58 and other opposition leaders for fueling the violence and not doing enough to stop it			0
@entity1 said the unrest had not kept him awake at night			2
" i sleep like a child , " he said			0
" luckily , i have peace of mind , total peace of mind , and i have it because i know i 've been loyal and i 'm filling the legacy of this marvelous giant figure who is president @entity42 , and it gives me peace of mind , and i do things with honesty to favor my people			0
" @entity1 said @entity2 has fine relations with the people of the @entity10			1
he cited trade union workers , artists , intellectuals and members of social movements as examples			0
but he acknowledged that relations between @entity118 and @entity119 have been rocky			0
" there is sufficient evidence of @entity10 agencies , of how you have conspired to put an end to this revolution , to destroy president @entity42 , " he said			1
last month , @entity1 expelled three @entity10 diplomats form @entity2 , accusing them of conspiring against his government			1
in response , the @entity10 last week expelled three @entity2 diplomats			1
but @entity1 held out hope for warmer relations			2
" we want to have a new type of relation , based on respect , equality among states and the recognition of what we are today , " he said			0
he said he was confident that his recent appointment of @entity141 as his new ambassador to @entity118 , a position that 's been vacant since 2008 , would result in progress			0
" i 'm certain that he will be very helpful to establish new levels of relations , " he said			0
@entity118 has appeared far less enthusiastic about closer ties with @entity2			2
a @entity150 spokeswoman said last month that the @entity10 wants to develop " a more constructive relationship with @entity2 , " but noted that would n't be easy			1
" we 've said many months ago that could include an exchange of ambassadors , " the spokeswoman , @entity153 , told reporters			0
" but @entity2 also needs to show seriousness for us to be able to move forward			2
and recent actions , including expelling three of our diplomats , continue to make that difficult			0
" that tense relationship could change , @entity1 said			2
asked what his message was for the @entity10 , the @entity2 president did n't hesitate			1
" my message is respect , dialogue , overcoming the visions that they have about @entity2			1
precisely , i made a decision to designate a new ambassador for the @entity10 , " @entity1 said			1
" do n't go into a dead end in relation to @entity2 and @entity177			2
our message to everyone in power in the @entity10 is respect @entity2 , respect @entity177 , and let 's establish new levels of relations			1
" @entity0 's @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
