@entity2 - turned independent candidate @entity9 posted a photo on @entity11 on thursday of himself , @entity0 and his @entity7 running - mate @entity12 , all of whom are sporting @entity16 pins			1
" people and progress over politics , " the caption reads			0
@entity0 hosted an event for @entity9 and @entity12 -- billing themselves as the " @entity23 " -- in her @entity25 home			2
her across - the - aisle endorsement is a jab at incumbent @entity29 gov. @entity29 , who served as @entity0 's lieutenant governor when she was the head of the @entity1 state government from 2006 to 2009			1
though they worked together for some time , @entity0 and @entity29 have been rivals ever since a policy dispute erupted shortly after @entity0 resigned from office and @entity29 took her place			2
during her tenure as governor , @entity0 increased oil taxes in the state , a revenue generator for @entity1 heralded by the 2008 vice presidential candidate as one of her biggest achievements			1
but @entity29 dismantled the tax , causing a divide between the former coworkers			0
voters took up the oil tax issue in a state - wide ballot initiative which ended up failing , leaving @entity29 's repeal in place			0
@entity29 and @entity0 , both republicans , campaigned aggressively during the voter referendum -- on opposing sides			0
the @entity1 governor race is considered a toss - up , with some polls giving @entity9 a small advantage			0
and it 's unclear whether @entity0 's endorsement will help @entity9 : 54 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of the former governor , according to a survey from @entity69 last month , a number which has steadily increased ever since she abruptly stepped down five years ago			1
the same poll shows her favorable rating at a mere 32 percent .			0
