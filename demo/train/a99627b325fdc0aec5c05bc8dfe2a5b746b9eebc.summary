censorship is a part of daily life in @entity3			1
news articles are erased from online search engines , social media sites such as @entity7 and @entity8 are banned , and @entity9 is routinely blacked out for @entity3 viewers			1
@entity11 was a huge hit in @entity3 -- until the government banned it during the @entity15 protests			1
" all good things must end , " one young @entity3 woman told me -- seemingly resigned to the fact that she can no longer post photos on @entity11			2
while such restrictions would likely incite mass outrage in many @entity25 countries , citizens in @entity3 often have no choice but to relinquish some personal freedom as the government keeps a firm grip on certain aspects of life in this booming society			1
@entity3 's @entity33 will do whatever it takes to stay in power			2
censorship is just one tool -- along with quickly quelling civil disobedience			0
of course , @entity3 feels like a utopia of liberty when compared with the repressive @entity42 regime			1
i distinctly remember feeling a sense of freedom and relief when landing in @entity46 after a recent visit to @entity48			0
in the @entity42 , the average citizen has never heard of the @entity50 or social media			2
contact with the outside world is forbidden for all but the most elite members of this reclusive society			0
@entity56 rules the television airwaves and fills the pages of state - run newspapers			0
censorship in @entity3 the @entity62 hack story has received limited news coverage in @entity3			1
stories have appeared on @entity66 's newscasts and in newspapers like @entity68 , though with far less prominence than some other international news outlets			0
in @entity72 on tuesday , an internet search for " @entity42 " on @entity3 's leading ( and government - controlled ) search engine @entity71 revealed a list of mostly positive articles about the @entity42			1
a @entity71 search for " @entity42 hack " in @entity80 revealed just one nearly two - week - old article naming the @entity42 as " one of several suspects " in the @entity62 hacking investigation			1
an identical search on unrestricted @entity86 on wednesday found more than 36 million articles			0
when questioned by foreign reporters on tuesday , @entity3 's @entity89 spokeswoman @entity88 shied away from directly addressing the issue on the @entity62 hacking probe			1
" we need sufficient evidence before drawing any conclusion , " she said at a news conference , adding that the @entity94 and @entity42 should communicate			1
of course , any substantive communication is unlikely given the two countries have no diplomatic ties			0
the @entity101 of @entity3 censorship is the reality of life behind the so - called @entity101 of @entity3			2
the @entity105 has been heavily censoring content for more than a decade			0
the @entity3 government acknowledges that the @entity50 is a vital tool to support the country 's rapid economic growth			2
@entity3 e-commerce company @entity111 transactions totaled nearly $ 250 million last year , more than @entity112 and @entity113 combined			0
@entity111 's overall revenue soared 54 % to over $ 2.7 billion in 2014			0
@entity3 e-commerce transactions are expected to skyrocket to more than $ 700 billion by 2017			0
but with the @entity50 comes the risk of sharing information that , the @entity3 government worries , could destabilize the country			2
in @entity3 , any threat to the @entity33 's tightly clenched grip must be controlled			2
it 's why you 're likely to find very little mention of @entity42 's bureau 121 in this nation suspected of having its own shadowy @entity126 unit 61398 -- believed to be responsible for cyberespionage			0
incidentally , the @entity3 military has also denounced the @entity94 for having its own massive cyberspying program			1
as all of this continues to unfold , one thing is certain : international news organizations such as @entity9 will continue with extensive coverage			0
and , thanks to heavy - handed government censors , most citizens of @entity3 will continue get only the news deemed appropriate by the government .			1

news on @entity62 hack is censored in @entity3 , with just a few stories that get little play
government - controlled search engine turns up just one article on " @entity42 hack "
@entity94 government believes *n.* @entity42 hackers are launching *attacks* from @entity3
