@entity0 -- a @entity3 subcommittee tuesday tackled one of the most contentious issues in @entity7 sports : the fairness of the @entity9 that decides the top college football team each season			2
@entity12 , right , of the @entity13 talks to coaches at the 2009 @entity9 national championship game january 8			1
convened by @entity17 sen. @entity16 of @entity18 , the hearing by the @entity21 , @entity21 and @entity22 subcommittee provided a sounding board for his state 's disappointment over the inability of the undefeated @entity27 to qualify for the @entity9 national championship game last january			1
the @entity9 operates under an agreement among the major college football conferences that decides which teams qualify for the biggest bowl games each season , including the national championship game			1
it also distributes the revenue generated by the bowl games , with the participating members taking part in more of the post-season matches and taking home more money			0
every season brings heated debate over the bowl lineup and calls for a playoff system similar to the ones used for every other @entity47 sport , including small - college football			0
president @entity49 has joined many @entity7 in expressing his preference for a playoff system to decide the nation 's top college football team			0
@entity16 complained that the @entity9 system denies outsiders -- such as @entity18 of the @entity56 -- a fair chance to compete with major conferences such as the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 for a spot in the lucrative bowl games			1
last season , he said , @entity27 went undefeated and gained a @entity9 berth in the @entity67 against perennial power @entity68 , which it defeated 31 - 17			1
however , the @entity9 ranking system prevented @entity18 from any realistic chance of selection for the national championship game , which pitted two teams that each had one loss on their records , @entity16 said			1
for schools outside what he called the " privileged conferences , " the @entity9 system has " significant and largely insurmountable obstacles to playing for a national championship , " @entity16 said			1
@entity27 president @entity84 complained that the @entity9 system both stifles competition and guarantees the majority of revenue from bowl games to the traditional powers			1
" if you ca n't beat them , eliminate them , " he said of @entity9 policy			2
in response , @entity95 chancellor @entity94 said the @entity9 system -- while imperfect -- is the only workable formula that ensures participation by major football powers such as his institution			2
the @entity9 recognizes the strength and depth of traditional programs , @entity94 said , rejecting @entity84 's argument that @entity18 has no chance to improve its status			2
" there realistically is something @entity18 could do , " @entity94 said			0
" they could play the schedule @entity95 played			0
" at the same time , @entity94 said that uneven odds are part of every university 's experience at one time or another			0
" it 's the same as when @entity95 walks into the @entity119 [ @entity119 ] and seeks a federal grant and competes with @entity121 , " he said			0
" theoretically we have the same the chance , but do we really ? " two anti-trust experts provided conflicting testimony on whether the @entity9 system violates the @entity127			2
@entity128 of the law firm @entity129 insisted the @entity9 holds what amounts to an illegal monopoly and " uses this control to exclude all but its founding members [ from ] fair access to the competition and control of hundreds of millions of dollars			0
" in response , @entity137 of @entity138 and @entity139 noted the @entity9 members created the national championship game and therefore have the right to determine who participates			1
he also warned against seeking anti-trust relief in court , saying a ruling against the @entity9 would end its existence without creating an alternative			0
" the peculiar irony of an anti-trust claim is that it is likely to sound the death knell for the playoff system proponents want , " @entity137 said .			0
