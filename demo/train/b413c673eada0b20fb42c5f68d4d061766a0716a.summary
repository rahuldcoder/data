@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 airlines should stop " kowtowing " to @entity6 security demands like making passengers take off their shoes and remove laptops from carry - on bags , the chairman of @entity12 argued at an industry conference			1
some security checks required by the @entity6 are " completely redundant , " @entity14 said at the @entity17 conference in @entity0 monday night , @entity12 confirmed to @entity2			1
he also criticized the @entity6 for demanding tighter security on inbound international flights than they do for @entity6 domestic travel			1
" @entity6 does not do internally a lot of the things they demand that we do , " he said			2
" we should n't stand for that			0
we should say , ' we 'll only do things which we consider to be essential and that you @entity6 also consider essential			2
' " we all know there 's quite a number of elements in the security program which are completely redundant and they should be sorted out , " he said			0
a @entity6 government security official dismissed @entity14 's comments			1
" these off - the - cuff comments by an individual representing a private , for - profit entity in no way reflect the close working relationship between the @entity6 and the @entity4 and are not indicative of the cooperative security efforts enjoyed by our two nations , " the official said			1
" these comments are simply out of touch with current intelligence - driven security policies			0
" but other industry executives were quick to support the @entity12 executive			1
" there will no doubt be widespread agreement , " said the head of the @entity52 in the @entity4			2
" it is about time the industry stepped back and had a look at what is really required and what we can do without , ensuring safety is not compromised , " @entity55 told @entity2			1
he said the industry should take " technological advances " into account when examining the " layer upon layer " of security measures that have been added over the years			0
the umbrella organization represents 85 airlines			1
@entity72 spokesman @entity71 said industry professionals " need to look at security again			0
" " for the passengers , it 's a tedious experience to queue for security , and if there are measures that do n't need to be there , they should n't be			1
it 's good for someone to challenge the industry , " he told @entity2			1
@entity85 , @entity4 transport minister , says that the government is responding to industry concerns			1
" i have listened to your concerns regarding the need to reform the regulatory framework for aviation security , " he said monday at the same conference where @entity12 's @entity14 was speaking			1
" and i intend to develop a new regulatory system , one where the government concentrates on setting the security outcomes that need to be achieved , and frees up operators to devise the security processes needed to deliver them in line with @entity101 requirements , " he said			0
the @entity102 said it " works closely with our international partners to ensure the best possible security			0
we constantly review and evolve our security measures based on the latest intelligence			0
" a @entity102 official said : " screening shoes increases security at the checkpoint			0
shoes remain a security concern because items may be hidden within the shoe and therefore they must continue to be thoroughly screened			0
screening shoes by x-ray is an effective method of identifying any type of anomaly , including explosives			0
" the flight comparison website @entity122 said " passengers are increasingly impatient with the time needed for current security checks			2
" " travellers are in favor of anything which will make security checks faster , but they need to feel confident that safety measures have not been compromised too , " said @entity127 , @entity122 's co-founder and business director , citing passenger surveys conducted by the website			2
@entity136 , which makes airport security equipment , said systems are constantly evolving in response to threats			0
" there is no one single solution to aviation security and we strongly agree that there should be common international standards , " @entity136 president @entity141 told @entity2			1
" these standards should help ensure consistency of security measures , airport efficiency and customer experience , " he said			0
airports began asking passengers to remove their shoes for scanning after @entity156 , a passenger on a flight from @entity158 to the @entity6 in december 2001 , hid explosives in his shoes in a failed attempt to blow up a plane			2
large quantities of liquid were banned from cabins in 2006 after @entity4 authorities broke up what they said was a plot to use liquid explosives to bring down @entity6 - bound planes			1
and airport security authorities have feared for decades that explosives could be hidden inside electronics , going back to the days of the @entity173			0
@entity2 's @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			2
