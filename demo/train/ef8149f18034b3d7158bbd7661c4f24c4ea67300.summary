-- the heat wave that 's bearing down on more than 150 million @entity2 in the @entity4 and @entity3 is also straining the nation 's power grid			1
the record temperatures and heat indexes mean more and more people are cranking on the air conditioners			2
many regional electricity providers are reporting record usage this week			0
read the latest on the heat wave in may , the power grid serving most of the @entity3 predicted a peak demand of just under 149,000 megawatts ( one megawatt can run 1,000 air - conditioning units at full power )			1
on wednesday , that grid produced more than 150,000 megawatts			1
@entity0 's @entity19 talked with @entity20 , an operations executive with @entity22 - based @entity21 , which serves 58 million customers in 13 states and the @entity25 , who said his utility is well - prepared for the increase in demand			1
@entity0 : how is your company doing in terms of providing power to its customers ? do you have enough ? @entity20 : yes , at this point , we believe that there is adequate capacity to serve all of the customer needs on the grid at this point			1
@entity0 : give us an idea of the situation : are you at peak capacity , or do you have room here to play with ? @entity20 : while we are at peak , this is the kind of week that we literally plan years for in advance to make sure the infrastructure 's in place			2
we train all year long to be prepared and everything is running well , and the grid is holding up , and we expect not to have any brownouts in the foreseeable future			0
@entity0 : what type of training do you do to avoid a brownout ? @entity20 : a lot of the training is being able to react to any situation that could happen on the grid , should a generator fail or a transmission line or transformer fail , being able to react to that , to redirect the power to ensure that the remaining of the grid stays up			2
@entity0 : what if you do need more power ? is there anything you can do ? @entity20 : we do have emergency procedures , as just mentioned			0
we can use what 's called a brownout , where we lower the voltage that does decrease the power use			0
we also have the ability to ask customers , to either voluntarily or through contractual obligations , get off the grid at that point			0
@entity0 : i 've read that as a heat wave persists , it takes more and more power to maintain cool temperatures			1
is that true ? @entity20 : yes , that 's true			0
you normally end up with residual heat buildup in the buildings , and therefore the air conditioners are working harder to maintain the same temperature because of that residual heat .			0

the @entity2 heat wave is *affecting* 150 million @entity2
a @entity3 power grid predicted a peak demand of under 149,000 megawatts
the demand has *surpassed* 150,000 megawatts
