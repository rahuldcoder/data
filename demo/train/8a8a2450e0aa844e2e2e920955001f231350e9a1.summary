attorney general @entity0 said monday that he found it " frustrating " that the @entity2 has n't been able to carry out criminal prosecutions of executives whose risky banking practices blamed for the global financial crisis			1
as @entity0 wraps up nearly six years at the helm of the @entity2 , the attorney general has drawn criticism for his department 's record on white collar crime			1
@entity0 frustrated no person went on trial for financial crisis some critics say the department failed by not bringing charges as a deterrent against shoddy practices on @entity20			1
some fault him for instead extracting billion dollar settlements from the world 's biggest banks			0
@entity0 has defended the department 's record saying the settlements are one way to prod shareholder to hold management more accountable			1
still , in an exclusive interview with @entity32 on monday , @entity0 acknowledged that the lack of criminal prosecutions of executives " is something that is frustrating			1
" " the @entity38 people should understand we looked at those matters , tried to come up with ways in which we could hold people and institutions accountable , " @entity0 told @entity32			1
" we have prosecuted certain institutions			0
we have gotten record amounts of money in and we 've used that money for appropriate remedial measures so that people can stay in their houses , have their mortgages reduced			0
so a lot of good has come from our efforts in that regard			0
" @entity0 noted that he has called for @entity56 to change federal law to encourage white collar whistleblowers from inside @entity20 to help the @entity2 bring cases			1
@entity0 ' cautiously optimistic ' on legal pot there are , he said , " a number of measures that i think @entity56 might change so that the prosecution of these kinds of cases is not as difficult as they are			1
" here are other things we learned from the interview : 1			0
there are " about a dozen " @entity38 jihadists in @entity72 and @entity73			1
that , at least , is " our estimate now , " @entity0 said			2
he said the government has " dozens of investigations that are underway about other people who have either gone or are planning to go			0
" " so this is something that is a priority for us on -- at the @entity2 and at the @entity82 , working in conjunction with our @entity38 attorneys , where we 're trying to engage in preventive activities as well , " he said			2
he wo n't write a book critical of @entity88 while the president 's in office			0
former defense secretary @entity91 criticized @entity88 's decision - making ability , especially in entanglements such as @entity72 , in a recently - published book			2
@entity0 said @entity91 's comments were " unfortunate " -- and that he should have waited			2
" frankly , i do n't think it 's something that a former cabinet member should do while the president he served is still in office , " @entity0 said			2
" that 's not something that i would even consider doing			0
he 's disappointed that gun control measures have n't become law			1
@entity0 said he takes it " personally as a failure " that @entity56 did n't react to shootings like the one in @entity105 , @entity106 , by changing @entity38 gun laws			1
" the inability to pass reasonable gun safety laws after the @entity105 massacre is something that weighs heavily on my mind , " @entity0 said			1
but he counts gay rights and voting rights efforts as important successes			0
he listed knocking down the " final vestiges of discrimination " on those issues among the first of " a whole variety of things that i 'm really proud of the people of this @entity2 and the way they 've done them over the past six years			0
" also on that list : criminal justice reforms ; record settlements with financial institutions ; and " the work we 've done in the national security sphere			2

he said if @entity137 , the officer who shot and killed @entity136 in @entity138 , is n't indicted , he 'd first want to see whether @entity132 's efforts were " adequate			0
" " i think what we 'll have to do , as we always do in a civil rights investigation from a federal perspective , is look at what the state has done and then make a determination as to whether or not the state investigation was adequate , " @entity0 said .			0
