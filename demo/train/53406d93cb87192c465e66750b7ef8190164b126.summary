@entity0 -- @entity2 called president @entity3 " the most radical president in @entity6 history " at the @entity7 last week			1
the leader of the 1994 @entity9 is a smart man and a historian , so he must know better			0
but he 's also exploring a run for president , an action that frequently suspends good judgment in pursuit of sound bites			2
perspective is the first thing abandoned in hyper - partisan attacks			2
so here is a look at five presidents who , it could be argued , exceed @entity3 in the " radical " sweepstakes			1
@entity24 : how about this for radical : a president who overturned the two - term precedent set by @entity28 and ultimately won four terms in an era when dictators were in vogue worldwide			1
he also proposed expanding the @entity33 to pack it with his own appointees , attempting to fundamentally alter the separation of powers			0
and his @entity37 created the basis for the modern welfare state in the @entity6 , whose apex under self - styled inheritor @entity41 provoked a backlash that ushered in a generation of conservative resurgence			1
@entity45 : the nation 's second president has been getting a well - deserved reappraisal , thanks to @entity51 's magisterial biography			1
but @entity45 ' signing of the @entity53 acts during the threat of war -- effectively outlawing anti-government dissent and curtailing freedom of speech and @entity58 -- was a radically anti-democratic action and a black mark on this @entity62 's otherwise honorable service to our nation			1
@entity65 : the man on the $ 20 bill was the original populist president , a general who fought @entity69 elites , @entity71 soldiers and native american tribes alike			1
@entity65 's wars with the @entity74 , @entity75 and the @entity33 were legendary			1
his native american removal policies rescinded previously agreed - upon treaties and brought about the infamous " @entity78 " that led to the deaths of thousands			0
@entity80 : abolitionists accused @entity80 of being insufficiently radical because he pledged only to preserve the union at all costs			1
but his political opponents accused him of being radical because he wanted to stop the spread of slavery , and they spurred secession from the union soon after hearing of his election			0
it 's a reminder that exaggerated fear of change can lead to the rise of violent factions			0
during the @entity95 , @entity80 suspended habeas corpus			1
he has become controversial again to some activists ; one panel at the @entity99 asked , " @entity100 : @entity101 ? " @entity102 : the @entity103 reversed decades of @entity6 foreign policy by allowing pre-emptive invasions of foreign nations			1
in @entity109 's case , this was complicated by the fact that the dictator in question did not , in fact , have the weapons of mass destruction as advertised			0
add to that @entity102 's reluctance to actually pay for his wars directly , which resulted in his turning a hard - won surplus into a deficit , and you 've got what can be considered a radical affront to small - government conservative principles from a @entity127 president			1
each of these presidents has his passionate defenders , and many are routinely listed among @entity6 's greatest chief executives			2
of course , plenty of other presidents could be added to this list : from @entity136 , who institutionalized segregation in the federal government , to @entity139 , whose " @entity145 " firing of his attorney general , @entity143 first deputy and independent special prosecutor created a constitutional crisis in the wake of @entity148			0
but you get the idea			0
none of the presidents are really radical in any global sense			0
any all - good or all - bad analysis of @entity6 history always misses the big picture			1
and politics is history in the present tense			0
yes , the past 16 months have seen unprecedented levels of government spending , intended to alleviate the economic crisis that was occurring when @entity3 took office			2
and although skyrocketing debts and deficits are dangerous if not addressed decisively in the near - term , @entity3 's general approach to the office has been decidedly more center - left than radical left			1
think @entity170 , for example , where he has committed more troops to the war			0
or his economic team , led by @entity176 administration alumni and @entity178 veterans			0
though many conservatives have called him a socialist , some liberals ( and libertarian @entity127 @entity182 ) consider him a " corporatist			0
" you ca n't be both a socialist and a corporatist at the same time			0
the larger issue is politics , plain and simple			0
@entity189 is trying to run for president			1
and red meat lines like " the most radical president in @entity6 history " help keep him relevant in @entity127 circles			1
the real issue is less what @entity3 has done as president than who he is			1
@entity189 and most baby boomer conservatives have spent their professional lives running against the liberal excesses of the 1960s			2
it is engrained in their political dna			0
and @entity3 looks like a child of the @entity209 , an embodiment of the social changes of the 1960s			2
the more centrist his rhetoric , the more some conservatives are convinced that it 's all part of activist @entity217 's playbook : to sound reasonable but act radical			0
the problem is that this suspicion of @entity3 's motives dooms any concept of common ground and poisons the well for bipartisan progress			2
you ca n't negotiate reasonably with a president when you 've convinced supporters that he is a threat to our constitutional republic			1
more broadly , we 've grown almost accustomed to these overheated attacks on the presidency			1
@entity233 on the right -- of which @entity189 's claim was a mild example -- was preceded by @entity237 on the left , with protestors comparing @entity240 to a @entity241 and a terrorist			2
as a country , we have become accustomed to using fear and hate in the service of hyper - partisanship			0
we need to wake up to the fact that demonizing people we disagree with , and indulging in attempts to delegitimize a duly elected president from @entity252 , hurts us all as a nation			0
we can do better -- and we deserve better , especially from people who want to lead the nation themselves			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			2

@entity2 called @entity3 " most radical president in @entity6 history "
@entity257 says @entity189 does n't have his history straight
he says @entity24 , @entity45 , @entity65 , @entity80 , @entity102 may have been more " radical "
@entity257 : " we 've grown almost accustomed to overheated attacks on presidency "
