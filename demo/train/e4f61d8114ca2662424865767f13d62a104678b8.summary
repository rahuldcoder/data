@entity0 whatever it was doing up in space , we may never know , but the @entity6 's unmanned @entity5 space plane returned to @entity7 this week , with still no details from the military on the nearly two - year mission			1
" the @entity17 mission 3 ( @entity5 - 3 ) , " as the military calls it , touched down at @entity12 in @entity13 on friday morning after conducting experiments in orbit for 674 days , the military said			1
conspiracy theorists endlessly conjecture on what the @entity20 is doing with " the newest and most advanced re-entry spacecraft			2
" the @entity6 's two vehicles resemble small space shuttles , and have now logged a combined 1,367 days in space , the military said			1
in the latest mission , the @entity5 lifted off from @entity28 in @entity29 on december 11 , 2012			0
at the time , the @entity6 said its mission would last about nine months			0
the military has spoken only in generalities about the spacecraft and its mission			1
" technologies being tested in the program include advanced guidance , navigation and control , thermal protection systems , avionics , high temperature structures and seals , conformal reusable insulation , lightweight electromechanical flight systems , and autonomous orbital flight , re-entry and landing , " an @entity6 statement said			0
theorists speculate the spacecraft is a space bomber , a spy plane against such targets as the @entity55 space station , or merely an experiment as the government states , according to a @entity59 story in 2012			1
the previous mission of the @entity5 , which landed at @entity12 on june 16 , 2012 , lasted 469 days , according to the @entity6			1
that mission was flown by the second of the orbiters			0
the latest mission is the second for the first of the orbiters , which was refurbished after it spent 224 days in orbit following an april 2010 launch			1
when the latest mission launched , the @entity6 said it might not be the last			0
" officials anticipate multiple missions will be required to satisfy the test program objectives , but the exact number of missions has not been determined , " a statement said			0
