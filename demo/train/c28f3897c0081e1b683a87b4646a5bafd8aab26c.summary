@entity0 -- federal investigators tuesday blamed the pilot of a @entity5 jet for causing the plane to skid off a runway at @entity9 's @entity8 in 2005 , an accident that killed a 6 - year - old boy			1
a @entity5 @entity12 - 700 , like the plane here , skidded off a @entity9 runway in 2005			1
" the probable cause was the pilot 's failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the aircraft after landing which resulted in a runway overrun , " the @entity16 ruled			1
@entity25 slid off a 6,500 - foot runway at @entity8 while landing during a heavy snowstorm in december 2005			1
the @entity28 was still moving at 46 mph when it crashed through a barrier wall and then slid into an intersection outside the airport grounds , hitting two cars			0
the @entity16 found the pilot and co-pilot were unfamiliar with the jet 's automatic brake system , which " distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing			1
" the agency also found the pilot 's failure to divert the flight to another airport amid reports of poor braking on the runway and tailwinds above 5 mph contributed to the accident			2
the accident killed @entity25 , 6 , of @entity50 , @entity51 , and injured 12 others , including his parents and two younger brothers			0
it was the first fatal accident in the history of the @entity58 - based airline			0
none of the 98 passengers and five crew members aboard the @entity63 - to - @entity9 flight were hurt			0
the @entity16 found @entity5 failed to provide its pilots with " clear and consistent guidance and training " on company policies regarding arrival landing - distance calculations			2
it also said the programming and design of the aircraft 's onboard computers and the airline 's plan to implement new auto - brake procedures without giving pilots time to learn those procedures contributed to the accident			0
