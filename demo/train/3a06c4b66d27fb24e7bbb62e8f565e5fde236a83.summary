@entity0 -- beaten with bicycle chains , burned with hot irons and bashed with a shoe , the case of @entity5 domestic helper @entity3 -- whose @entity7 employers were jailed this week over the assaults -- highlights just how tough @entity0 can be for some of the city 's thousands of foreign domestic helpers			1
for many of these estimated 292,000 workers , the city 's highly regulated if @entity16 work conditions are a luxury			0
" i worked in @entity23 between 2005 and 2006 and @entity0 is much , much better , " domestic helper @entity21 told @entity1			1
" the minimum wage in @entity23 is $ us200 ( per month ) but absolutely no one paid that			0
we were paid $ 150 and were locked into three - year contracts and we were required to work seven days a week			0
" for vulnerable groups like @entity31 , or @entity31 as they are known in the @entity32 , basic political stability is another of @entity0 's attractions			2

" my employers were in @entity43 at the time and we were just two domestic helpers in an empty house with rockets falling everywhere			1
locked in " it was so nerve - wracking because my employers said once we 'd left the house , as far as they were concerned we 'd left the job and we could n't go back again			0
" even when we 'd grabbed our passports and work permits and got out the front gate , no taxi driver was willing to drive us to the embassy because it was in a @entity56 area of the city that was under fire			0

@entity0 's @entity67 ( @entity67 ) released a study this year based on interviews with more than 3,000 foreign domestic workers , and found that almost one third had no proper accommodation within the house			1
no privacy " they do not have their own room provided and have to either share the bedroom with other members of the household or sleep in common areas of the apartment , such as the living room , study or playroom where there is very little privacy , " the study reported			2
" some even sleep in unsuitable spaces such as the bathroom , toilets , veranda , corridor , kitchen and storage rooms , with only makeshift beds on top of ovens , cupboards or bathtubs			0
there are @entity103 that are forced to share the room with young adult male members of the household , " it added			0
@entity67 director @entity106 told the @entity0 - based @entity107 that the government requirement that maids must live with their employer meant they had nowhere to run when they were abused			2
she said the decision should be left to the employers and the maids whether they live together			2
she also urged the government to scrap a policy that requires domestic helpers to leave @entity0 just two weeks after their contracts expire , saying it did not give workers enough time to find new work			1
" it often forces the helpers to endure abuses so they can hold on to their jobs , " she said , adding that they needed the jobs to support their families back home			0
@entity5 foreign domestic worker @entity130 , chairwoman of the @entity132 in @entity0 , told the @entity107 agency fees that could often amount to hk $ 21,000 ( us $ 2,708 ) -- deductible from a foreign domestic worker 's first seven months of salary -- were another reason so many helpers tolerated unfair treatment			1
for @entity21 , however , live - in arrangements , especially with demanding employers , means that as a foreign domestic worker you are on call 24 hours a day , six days a week			1
" you can be woken up any time of the night just to get a glass of water , " she said			0
" living outside is what all domestic helpers want -- it means you can finally get some rest			1
