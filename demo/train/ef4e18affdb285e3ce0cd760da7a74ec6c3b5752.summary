if there were an obvious takeaway for the 2016 hopefuls this year , it might as well have been the motto for the 1992 presidential campaign of @entity7 : " it 's the economy , stupid			1
" so it is no wonder that many of @entity13 's touchstones on the campaign trail this year have come straight from her husband 's 1992 playbook — at times almost verbatim — a focus on rebuilding the middle class , addressing income inequality , and reviving the @entity21 promise that each generation should fare better than the last			1
the echoes of the early 1990s in @entity7 's speeches as she weighs a run for the presidency are no accident			1
in what amounted to her first major foray on the campaign trail in september at retiring @entity36 @entity35 sen. @entity34 's steak fry , she spoke of restoring " the basic bargain of @entity21 " -- one her husband had proposed in the 1992 campaign -- that " no matter who you are or where you come from , if you work hard and you play by the rules , you deserve the opportunity , the same opportunity as anyone else , to build a good life for yourself and your family			1
" flash back to @entity7 's speech in struggling @entity50 , @entity51 , in april of 1992			1
@entity52 that he grew up with , @entity7 said in a typical line from his stump speech , had been shattered for millions of @entity21			1
" the idea , " he said , " that if you worked hard and played by the rules you 'd be rewarded , you 'd do a little better next year than you do last year , and your kids will do better than you — that idea has been devastated			0
" if she runs for president , pundits will invariably argue for the next two years over whether a @entity62 would look more like a third term of @entity64 or @entity7 — and @entity35 face a difficult challenge holding on to the @entity62 given that it often flips to the opposing party after eight years of one - party control			2
but when it comes to voter frustration and unease , @entity13 may be on strikingly similar terrain to what she and her husband navigated in 1991 and 1992			1
" you just look at the statistics now and they really do match up with 1992 , " said @entity76 , a @entity62 adviser to @entity7 in the 1990s			2
given that the @entity79 left the @entity62 in the midst of an economic boom with unemployment at about 4 % , @entity76 argues that there are only upsides for the former secretary of state in associating herself with her husband 's tenure			1
" she benefits enormously from connecting herself to that time period , but it also requires putting out a vision that matches with today 's challenges , " @entity76 said			0
" it really gets down to the basic idea of what needs to be in place in this day and age so that if you 're a middle class family , your kids are actually going to have the opportunity to do better than you			0
" heading into 2016 , the economy has been steadily recovering with unemployment dropping below 6 % ; as @entity7 campaigned in 1991 , the economy was in a backward slide ( unemployment rose from 6.8 % in 1991 to 7.5 % )			2
but the pessimism many @entity21 feel is eerily comparable to when @entity13 first stepped out on the national stage			2
only about 23 % of @entity21 said they were satisfied with the direction of the country in the 2014 @entity111 survey , just a shade higher than what the polling firm measured in 1991 and 1992			1
in an august @entity118 / @entity117 poll , 60 % of voters said they believed @entity21 was in a state of decline , compared with 63 % who said that in december of 1991			2
there has been even greater erosion in the sense of hopefulness about the prospects of the younger generation			0
in december of 1991 and 1992 , the number of @entity21 who said they were confident that life for the next generation would be better than their own was between 41 % and 44 %			1
this august that number sank to 21 %			0
aligning with @entity7 's early ' 90s riff on the fading @entity21 dream , the december 2014 @entity137 / @entity136 poll found that only 64 % of @entity21 believe it is possible to start poor in this country , work hard and become rich -- an even lower percentage than in the mid- 1990s ( 70 % )			1
@entity144 pollster @entity143 noted that @entity7 won in 1992 by wrapping his middle - class focused message around a policy agenda with conservative elements that appealed to a broader audience			2
" @entity7 in 1992 was running as a center - left democrat who wanted to end welfare as we know it , he was for the death penalty , he ripped into @entity154 for saying we ought to have a week where we kill white people , " @entity143 said			2
by contrast , @entity13 " is for all the touchstones of the left today , " he said , and has yet to show how she would win over more moderate voters			0
while @entity7 ran as the candidate of strength and experience in 2008 , @entity162 , a @entity144 strategist who advised former president @entity163 and 2008 @entity144 presidential nominee @entity164 , said @entity7 has yet to clearly outline a justification for her candidacy in 2016			2
" i do n't think it 's readily apparent to anybody , including most every @entity150 , what @entity13 is running for president to do or to be , which was not ever the issue with @entity7 , " @entity162 said			2
" there are change elections and there are ' more of the same ' elections , and there was a lot of economic anxiety in the 1992 election and ( @entity7 ) was able to drive a change narrative			1
" " after eight years of @entity64 , it 's very difficult to understand what kind of change it is that @entity13 's candidacy could represent , " he said			0
to the extent that @entity13 has hinted at her policy agenda , she has not been shy about suggesting that she would build on her husband 's legacy , which she took part in shaping as his informal strategist , sounding board and speech editor			1
the central thread through many of @entity7 's political speeches in recent months has once again been the idea of championing the middle class — the " invisible @entity21 " as she called them in 2008 — or " fighting for the forgotten middle class " as her husband 's 1992 campaign brochure framed his version of that message			1
when talking about expanding paid family leave , for example , she often notes that the @entity213 was the first bill her husband signed in the @entity62			0
she has also reminded audiences that he signed legislation that raised the minimum wage in 1996 , as she makes the case for another increase			0
when addressing economic angst while campaigning for @entity35 hopeful @entity223 in @entity36 in late october , she alluded to the @entity224 years as a kind of golden era : " millions of new jobs were created , more families made it into the middle class , and more families got lifted out of poverty , " she said			0
moving beyond nostalgia , she has also tried out variations of the 1992 campaign lines			0
in seeking to connect , she has echoed the motto that her husband used in his 1992 convention speech : " i am a product of the middle class and when i am president , you will be forgotten no more			2
" " i am a product of the @entity21 middle class , " she said at the women in the @entity242 in april , adding that she wanted other @entity21 children to have the opportunities she had			0
at the @entity247 , she lamented that @entity21 families " are working harder than ever " but finding that maintaining a middle class lifestyle is like " rolling a boulder uphill			0
" cue the tape again to @entity7 's 1992 convention speech : " people are working harder than ever , " he said , " and their incomes are still going down			1
" when she was by his side during a 1992 bus tour from @entity257 to @entity258 , @entity7 sought to strengthen his connection with working class voters by saying he was " tired of the dignity being stripped from blue collar work in @entity21			1
" when @entity13 went to @entity51 in october , she carried that theme forward while campaigning for @entity35 gubernatorial candidate @entity264			0
" there is nothing but dignity in hard work , " she said in that speech , calling for greater respect for the jobs held by her own generation and that of her parents			0
if the winning strategy for any candidate in 2016 is to show an understanding of the economic angst that voters are feeling — and policies to address it — @entity144 strategists point out that @entity7 's other hurdle will be that her husband was far more natural in showing his empathy for others as he delivered that message			1
in anticipation of her run , @entity144 have pounced on every opportunity to argue that it has been a long time since the @entity79 were a struggling young couple in @entity290 — focusing on their wealth and her hefty speech fees			0
" she has lived a pretty gilded life for the last couple of decades , " said @entity144 strategist @entity293 , referring to the trappings of @entity7 's various roles as first lady , @entity297 and secretary of state like her security detail			1
" when 's the last time that she got into a cold car ? " @entity7 's most notable stumble in that arena was when she told @entity306 's @entity305 during her book tour that she and her husband were " not only dead broke , but in debt " when they left the @entity62 , as they struggled to pay mortgages on several homes and their daughter 's private school education			1
she quickly sought to clarify her remarks on " @entity314			0
" " i fully appreciate how hard life is for so many @entity21 today , " she said			0
" it 's an issue that i 've worked on and cared about my entire life			0
" in 2016 , @entity144 will be looking for every opportunity to make her prove it .			0

@entity7 's economic *rhetoric* is straight from husband 's 1992 playbook
she has spoken of restoring " the basic bargain of @entity21 "
voter frustration is *reminiscent* of what the @entity79 navigated in 1991 and 1992
