@entity0 -- the annual @entity2 drew 10,000 activists to @entity0 over the weekend			1
the event traditionally concludes with a presidential straw poll			1
last year , the poll was won by @entity7			1
this year , @entity8 won , with 31 percent of the ballots cast			1
@entity2 's organizers cautioned against over-interpreting the @entity8 win			1
participation in the poll had been light , the @entity8 team had just out - organized , etc. all true enough			1
but it 's also true that @entity8 - style themes have percolated through the conservative movement since @entity8 's beat - the - spread 2008 presidential campaign			1
of all those themes , the one that has achieved the widest audience is @entity8 's call for a return to money based on precious metals such as gold and silver			1
@entity29 observed that you should never pull down a fence until you understand why it was put up			0
so let 's rediscover why it was that @entity34 abandoned the gold standard in the first place			1
in 1929 , the @entity34 economy slumped into recession			0
under the weight of a series of terrible decisions , that recession collapsed into the worldwide @entity43			1
but why did decision - makers make so many bad decisions ? the short answer is that they were trapped			0
almost all of the right decisions would have ballooned the @entity34 federal budget deficit			0
as budget deficits expanded , investors would inevitably worry that their dollars might lose value in the future			2
they would demand to trade their dollars for gold at the fixed price of $ 20.67 to the ounce			1
under the rules of the gold standard , the @entity34 government would be obliged to sell			1
as long as the deficits continued , the @entity34 government would lose gold			2
threatened with the exhaustion of its gold supply , the government felt it had no choice : it had to close the budget deficit			2
so , in the throes of a severe downturn , the @entity34 government did exactly the opposite of what economists would otherwise advise : it cut spending and raised taxes -- capsizing the economy even deeper into depression			2
it 's very strange to hear gold standard advocates criticize president @entity78 for imposing steep tax increases in 1932 , the @entity43 's worst year			1
yet the gold standard they champion was the reason for the tax increases they deplore			1
between 1929 and 1932 , the @entity34 money supply collapsed , as banks failed and bank deposits and commercial credit vanished			0
in their classic " @entity88 " ( 1966 ) , @entity90 and @entity91 identified this contraction of the money supply as the proximate cause of the @entity43			2
why did n't the @entity94 act to prevent the contraction ? again : the gold standard			1
in a modern recession , the @entity94 will buy treasury securities in the open market			0
after the purchase and sale , the @entity94 has more securities -- and the former owners of the securities have new cash			0
those new cash owners then spend or lend their cash , spurring economic activity			0
but in 1930 , the new cash owners did n't spend or lend			0
they swapped their cash for gold			0
the " open market " operations that were supposed to accelerate economic activity instead accelerated the country 's gold drain			2
so the @entity94 ceased -- and instead passively allowed the economy to collapse in order to save the nation 's currency			0
every other gold - standard country faced similar challenges in the 1930s			1
those countries that quit gold first , like @entity125 , suffered least			0
those that hung onto gold longest -- the @entity34 and @entity128 -- suffered most			0
imagine now if the gold standard were in operation today			1
the federal government would be scrambling to balance its budget in the midst of recession , cutting spending and raising taxes			0
instead of pumping money into the economy , the @entity94 would be sucking money out			0
priority 1 would not be creating and saving jobs , but preserving the nation 's gold hoard			2
instead of living through the nastiest recession since the war , we 'd be deep into a second @entity43			2
but in a way , this counterfactual is impossible			0
no government ever can return to the gold standard			1
back in the 1930s , governments accepted horrific suffering because they were terrified of the consequences of going off gold			2
when president @entity157 told his budget director , @entity156 , of his decision to quit gold , @entity156 replied : " this is the end of @entity162 civilization			0
" he was n't kidding either			0
in fact , the decision was the turning point of the @entity43 , the beginning of recovery			2
and every monetary economist knows it			0
which means that the first thing any future gold - standard government would do in the event of recession would be to jettison gold			2
and every market trader knows that too			0
so ... as soon as the first sign of recession materializes on the horizon , the traders would dump the currency of the gold standard country			1
the gold standard country would then have to decide whether to self - impose draconian 1932 - style budget - balancing or forgo the whole painful experience and surrender right away to what is inevitable sooner or later			1
since everybody knows that a gold standard country would quit gold as soon as times got tough , nobody will ever believe the decision to restore the gold standard in the first place			1
it 's as dead as monocles and walking sticks			0
the punch line to one of my favorite anecdotes goes , " son , your answers are so old , i have forgotten the questions			0
" has the @entity43 receded so far into history that the answers that once plunged the nation into misery can possibly look credible again ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of @entity215 .			1

@entity8 won the presidential straw poll at the @entity2 *conference*
@entity215 says part of @entity8 's appeal is his advocacy of basing dollars on precious metals
he says the gold standard made the downturn of the 1930s into the @entity43
the markets wo n't take seriously any revival of the gold standard , he says
