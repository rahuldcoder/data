@entity0 -- a march 16 referendum on whether the @entity3 should rejoin @entity4 has become the focus of the @entity7 crisis			1
like nearly every aspect of the conflict , the vote planned by @entity3 's regional parliament evokes widely differing interpretations of its legitimacy and importance			0
here are some of the biggest questions about the issue , with a look at how key players are weighing in : 1 ) what is the @entity3 referendum ? voters in the autonomous @entity7 region of about 2 million people will choose between remaining part of the former @entity27 territory or becoming part of neighboring @entity4			1
the referendum follows the lightning chain of events in @entity7 in previous weeks that included increasingly violent protests against the government , the country 's @entity35 president fleeing across the border , and then @entity4 troops seizing what amounts to military control of @entity3 -- where @entity4 's @entity42 fleet is based			1
by unanimously backing the referendum , the @entity3 parliament signaled the intentions of regional leaders as well as @entity4 to restore the territory to @entity49 's control			1
@entity7 's interim government insists @entity3 is part of the country , a stance supported by the @entity54 and its @entity56 allies			1
disturbing tales emerge from @entity3 2 ) is it legal ? depends on who you ask			0
in the @entity7 , the interim government rejects the referendum as unconstitutional , while many in the @entity64 desire the chance to again align with @entity49			2
@entity4 says the political upheaval in @entity7 that forced out president @entity67 ended the @entity70 government 's constitutional authority			1
after a phone conversation thursday between president @entity73 and @entity4 president @entity74 , the @entity71 said @entity74 made the point in the call that the ousting of @entity67 was an " anti-constitutional coup			0
" now , it says , the people of @entity3 should have the right to decide their future in the same way as other autonomous regions , such as @entity86 's breakaway from @entity87			0
@entity73 , however , declared thursday that " the proposed referendum on the future of @entity3 would violate the @entity7 constitution and violate international law			1
" @entity92 , the @entity54 ambassador to the @entity93 , told @entity1 on thursday that the @entity7 constitution requires territorial referendums to be held " across the entirety of @entity7 and not just in a sub-region like this			2
" she argued that @entity67 fled on his own volition , and that constitutional authority agreed to in a february 21 deal he reached with opposition leaders and @entity56 envoys remained in effect			1
under that agreement , @entity7 will elect a new government on may 25 for the entire country , including @entity3			1
@entity4 @entity107 backs @entity3 vote , brushes off sanctions threat 3 ) what would it mean ? @entity73 's quick condemnation of a @entity3 referendum showed the @entity54 expects the outcome to favor realigning with @entity4			1
the autonomous region has a 60 % ethnic @entity4 population , having been part of @entity4 until it was ceded to @entity7 in 1954 by the @entity27			2
while it would still remain an autonomous region in theory , @entity3 would effectively come under the direct influence of @entity4 once again			2
@entity92 said that if the referendum goes forward , the result would get little recognition beyond @entity4			0
that did n't matter in 2008 when @entity4 under @entity74 sent troops into neighboring @entity127 , another former @entity27 territory , to back autonomy for the @entity35 regions of @entity130 and @entity131			0
more than five years later , both territories effectively annexed with @entity4 forces still present			0
asked if @entity3 and perhaps other parts of eastern and southern @entity7 that favor @entity4 might end up the same , @entity92 said : " i think it 's maybe not helpful to talk about precedents			1
" " we are seeking to create a future where the past is not replicated here in @entity7 , and the broad unity of the international community i think is impressive and formidable , " she added			0
cyberwar hits @entity7 4 ) potential fallout ? for @entity4 , the motivation is ensuring control of its @entity147 based in @entity148 as well as its economic influence in @entity7 and other former @entity27 territories and satellites			0
the @entity3 referendum would provide an electoral justification for what amounts to a land grab amid @entity7 's political upheaval			2
@entity73 acknowledged @entity4 had legitimate concerns that needed to be part of a solution , such as guarantees it could maintain the @entity148 - based naval fleet in @entity7			2
however , his call for @entity4 troops in @entity3 to return to barracks and negotiations between @entity4 and @entity7 on a solution has so far yielded little progress			1
both the @entity54 and @entity168 have threatened sanctions if no significant progress occurs soon , but major economic ties between @entity4 and @entity56 powers such as @entity173 raise questions about the strength of any @entity168 steps			1
@entity1 's @entity177 said @entity74 may get his wish with @entity3 , but at a cost			0
" they got @entity3 , but they 've scared off @entity7 , " he said			0
" and , most importantly , the people of @entity7 are now deeply suspicious of @entity4			0
the people in @entity184 and @entity185 and the @entity186 , or probably in places like @entity188 , are all now fearful			0
" @entity1 's @entity189 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 backs a @entity3 - only vote about joining it or staying with @entity7
the @entity54 and its @entity56 allies say such a referendum is **illegal**
to @entity4 , the ousting of the elected @entity7 government was **illegal**
at issue is whether constitutional authority exists in @entity7
