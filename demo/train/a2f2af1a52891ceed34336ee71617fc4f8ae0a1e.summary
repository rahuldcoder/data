-- nicknamed @entity1 , or @entity1 , because of its shape , @entity1 has an eerie , sinister look , perfect for , say , a villain 's lair in an action movie			1
the inspiration for villain @entity11 's deserted hideout in the @entity14 movie " @entity11 , " the island figures in one of the most dramatic shots of the film			1
its industrial ruins loom slowly into view as @entity14 and yet another ill - fated @entity22 speed toward the island in a luxury boat			2
in real life , a trip to the island is less dramatic			2
in 2009 , tour operators began offering trips from @entity29 to @entity1			1
a standard trip entails a 40 - minute boat ride and then an hour on the island , depending on weather conditions -- often the weather is so poor that boats do n't even try to land			2
those hoping to pick their way through the rubble in @entity14 's footsteps , or take a photo at building number 65 , where @entity43 meets a gruesome end , will be disappointed			2
the tourist route is a clearly defined path skirting just a quarter of the island			0
while there 's a good view of the ruins , visitors ca n't get anywhere close			1
for that they need special permission from the @entity54 , and a compelling reason for going inside			0
there 's a simple explanation for all the security -- the ruins are extremely dangerous			1
read more : @entity1 's wartime past boom and bust history for almost 100 years , @entity1 was a mining facility run by corporate giant @entity63			1
the mining community was housed in some of @entity65 's and the world 's earliest concrete high - rises			1
on this tiny 16 - acre plot of land , high - rises were the best option for housing			0
by 1959 , the island was one of the most densely populated places on earth , with 5,259 people living on just 18 acres			0
but by 1974 , gas had replaced coal as @entity65 's major fuel source , @entity63 pulled out of the island , workers found jobs elsewhere and @entity1 was left to rot			1
according to the @entity54 , location scouts from @entity11 's production team spent several days on the island but decided it was too dangerous to film there			1
instead , sets duplicating @entity1 's eerie wreckage were built in @entity88 in the @entity89			1
security for visitors visitors who are given permission must wear hard hats and have an escort from @entity29 's city council			1
additional caution is necessary -- balconies and railings are long gone and a wrong turn up the " stairway to hell " to the rooftop can lead the unwary visitor to narrow pathways between buildings with perilous drops on either side			0
those who think they remember the way down from a climb to the top of the structure -- a small , wind - blown shrine remains there -- can find themselves in rooms with gaping holes in the floorboards and sheer drops to floors below			0
ghost town although @entity1 was by no means abandoned overnight , it feels as though it might have been			1
in the school , exercise books and broken abacuses lie in corners where sea winds have blown them			0
sheets of x-rays scatter the floor in the hospital , with faded imprints of miners ' lungs still visible			0
children 's shoes dot ruined pathways , as though their owners lost them while running to evacuate			2
it feels a bit like @entity143 , the town adjoining @entity145 , where residents really did leave in a hurry after the town 's nuclear reactor exploded in 1986			2
weird stories there are plenty of tales of weirdness surrounding everyday life on the island			0
a guide who works at @entity160 , @entity157 is one of the three tour operators who lead trips to the island			1
although @entity157 lived on the island for only a year in 1961 , he 's full of stories			2
from the water , he points out spots where lovers would climb onto the island walls to watch the sunset , seeking out the smallest bit of privacy in a place where privacy was a rarity			0
" it reminded me of @entity177 , " he says			0
" cooking hours were quite noisy			0
wives would borrow seasoning and exchange food they could n't eat			0
" no one would lock the door			0
there was an old woman called ' watchdog ' who checked on everyone who came in and out and would know everyone 's business			2
" @entity157 also talks about the darker side of @entity1 's past			1
before and during @entity193 , @entity1 , like many industrial sites in @entity65 , was a location for forced labor			1
@entity196 and @entity198 prisoners of war were kept here , enduring varying degrees of hardship			0
conditions in the mines were grueling			0
workers were subjected to heat and humidity with very little to eat and beatings if they slacked			0
according to local records , 123 @entity209 and 15 @entity198 died on the island between 1925 and 1945			0
@entity1 is one of several industrial sites awaiting inclusion on @entity215 's list of @entity216			1
@entity217 , however , has formally objected to the island 's petition for recognition due to its association with wartime slave laborers			2
see also : ' slave trade ghost town ' : the dark history of @entity225 former @entity198 laborers are still trying to gain compensation and an official apology from @entity63 for their enslavement at sites across the empire during @entity193 to @entity65 's neighbors , the island , in its ruined eeriness , is a symbol of a war wound that wo n't heal			1
to most @entity65 , it 's a decaying remnant from a forgotten time .			1

@entity65 's abandoned @entity1 was the inspiration for the villain 's lair in " @entity11 "
tour operators have been offering trips from @entity29 to @entity1 since 2009 , but access is limited
the ruins are spectacular and dangerous , and come with a dark history
