companies too have been attracted to the format as a way of motivating staff			2
" golfers love a challenge , " says @entity30 , who runs hickory golf days in @entity32			1
" there 's a saying about modern golf clubs that you can buy any shot out of the shop			2
playing with hickory makes people think more about their swing and be clever about their shots			0
" @entity46 clubs were used widely until the 1930s , when manufacturers turned to more modern materials for construction			0
however , despite their lesser performance , the attraction of dressing up in old - fashioned golfing garb and hacking around 18 holes with mashies , niblicks and cleeks -- the evocative names given to the clubs used by @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 -- has endured			2

the load has since been shipped to @entity107 in bundles of 20			2
" i think he is tapping into a growing market over there			0
new golf courses are opening in @entity107 all the time , " says @entity103			2
