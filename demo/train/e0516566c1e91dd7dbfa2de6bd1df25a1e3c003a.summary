a nurse 's assistant in @entity2 -- the first person to contract @entity3 outside @entity4 -- has taken a turn for the worse			1
dr. @entity6 , who works at @entity9 's @entity8 hospital , said thursday that @entity11 ' condition had worsened but declined to give further details			1
@entity13 became sick after she helped treat an @entity3 - stricken @entity2 missionary			1
her case has prompted questions from her fellow medical professionals about whether they are properly equipped to safely treat @entity3 patients , and about why a week passed before she was treated			2
the update on her condition comes 10 days after @entity13 first began feeling sick and three days after she called an ambulance to take her to a hospital			1
@entity8 hospital indicated late thursday that seven more people -- a doctor , three nurses , two beauticians , a doctor and a hospital staffer -- have been admitted for observation			2
this is in addition to seven others already in the hospital , though none of these besides @entity13 has tested positive for @entity3			1
" the reason why we are seeing so many people admitted showing no symptoms is because the 80 people or so that are being monitored outside the hospital have been given the choice to do it at home or come into the hospital , " said a hospital spokeswoman , who is not named , as is customary in @entity2			0
in addition to concerns about @entity13 and these individuals ' health , the entire situation has raised serious questions about how the entire case was handled -- from how the nurse 's assistant got the disease to how medical officials handled her care once she got sick			1
physician : my protection suit was too short one of the physicians sounding the alarm -- dr. @entity64 , who treated @entity13 at a different @entity9 hospital earlier in the week -- published an open letter thursday indicating that his staff was ill - equipped to handle her			1
concerned about his exposure to @entity13 , @entity64 then checked himself into @entity69 was among five who the hospital said had no symptoms			2
@entity64 says he cared for @entity13 on monday at @entity9 's @entity73 , where an ambulance had taken her that morning			1
he wrote that the sleeves on the protective suits available to him were too short , exposing parts of his arms			2
in his letter , published thursday by @entity2 news outlets , @entity64 wrote that @entity13 was in an isolation room			0
he said he visited her 12 times in isolation from 8 a.m. to midnight , when she was transferred to @entity8 , which specializes in infectious diseases			0
her condition worsened throughout the day , and by the evening she had tested positive twice for @entity3 , he wrote			2
but @entity64 said he learned of both positive results from media before hospital officials told him			0
deadliest @entity3 outbreak : what you need to know he said he was told of the second positive test at 7 p.m. , but it took five more hours for an ambulance to collect her for the trip to @entity8 , he wrote			0
@entity64 adds to a chorus of @entity2 medical professionals who 've expressed alarm			0
speaking about what 's unfolding in @entity9 , health minister @entity103 told @entity105 earlier this week @entity2 is going to revise its protocols for handling @entity3			1
prime minister @entity107 said that his country is " facing a matter that is of international concern			0
" but that does n't mean @entity2 should hunker down or become overly alarmed , he said , and urged them to " keep calm			0
" how @entity112 is preparing for @entity3 dismay in @entity9 the ebola virus has infected more than 8,000 people and killed at least 3,800 in the current outbreak , according to the @entity116			1
it 's also been largely confined -- as far as we know so far , every person has caught the disease in @entity4 except for @entity13			1
@entity13 's case began after two @entity2 missionaries -- @entity123 and @entity124 -- contracted @entity3 in @entity4			1
they were sent to @entity2 , specifically @entity8 , for treatment			0
@entity13 twice had contact with one of the priests as part of his care , on september 24 and september 25 , the @entity116 said			0
both priests eventually died at the hospital			0
@entity13 's patient died on september 25 ; on september 29 , she began feeling ill. that @entity13 may have gotten @entity3 at @entity8 is a major cause of concern , especially if she did -- as she told @entity2 newspaper @entity137 -- follow the necessary protocols while caring for the missionaries			1
how did @entity2 nurse catch @entity3 ? dr. @entity141 , who is among those treating her , said @entity13 may have been exposed while removing protective gear she 'd donned to treat one of the priests			1
" that 's what we were working on -- on the errors possibly made while removing the protective suit , " @entity141 told reporters this week , saying it 's possible the protective suit or gloves may have touched her face			0
on tuesday -- the morning that @entity13 was transferred from @entity73 to @entity8 for treatment -- angry doctors and nurses outside @entity8 said they were outraged that the two priests , almost dead when they arrived , had been brought there			2
also prompting concern is how long it took for @entity13 to be treated -- and how long she may have exposed other people to the deadly virus while she was contagious			2
according to a @entity8 hospital spokeswoman , @entity13 started feeling ill on september 29			2
she went the next day to her doctor , who did not properly identify her problem and sent her home			0
but @entity13 did n't get better			0
she called @entity8 hospital on october 2 and was directed , per protocol , to an external medical department under the umbrella of @entity9 's regional health service , the hospital spokesman said			1
@entity13 ended up back home again			0
on monday , she called an ambulance , which took her to @entity73 hospital , which diagnosed her over a 16 - hour period and sent her to @entity69 @entity64 's letter did n't address how long @entity13 might have been outside an isolation room at @entity73			1
a worker at that hospital told @entity184 on condition of anonymity earlier this week that @entity13 lay in the emergency room -- exposed to other patients as well as medical staff -- for eight hours before she was transferred to @entity69 @entity13 's experience is similar to that of @entity192 , the @entity193 citizen who was sent home from a @entity197 , @entity196 , hospital days before eventually being admitted for @entity3			1
@entity192 , the first person diagnosed with @entity3 in the @entity198 , died wednesday			0
@entity13 's dog put down authorities said tuesday that a total of 30 people from @entity203 and 22 others -- from the @entity73 hospital where the woman first sought care , plus family members -- were being monitored			1
@entity9 health authorities on wednesday put down @entity13 's dog , @entity211 , despite a public outcry to save it			1
' @entity211 ' campaign fails about 400,000 people signed an online petition to save the dog from being killed , contending that that " it would be much easier to isolate or quarantine the dog just as they have the victim 's husband , " rather than forcing the couple to lose " one of the family			0
" but health authorities insisted they had to take action in case @entity211 had the disease			0
it 's not known if @entity3 can be passed through canines			2
the @entity116 has said that it 's infected chimpanzees , gorillas , fruit bats , monkeys , forest antelope and porcupines			0
human infections , to date , have not been linked to dogs			0

14 total are in a @entity9 hospital ; @entity13 is the only one with *confirmed* @entity3
doctor declines to give further details about @entity11 ' condition , treatment
another doctor , who tended to patient , says his protective sleeves were inadequate
the nurse 's assistant treated missionaries from @entity4 who had @entity3
