no provisions have been added to the contract , @entity7 said , but secretary of state @entity16 ordered several changes to procedure after a september incident in which @entity4 guards shot and killed 17 people , including women and children			1
the incident placed the operations of @entity4 and other security firms under scrutiny in @entity6 , where an estimated 25,000 private contractors protect diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials			1
under a provision instituted in the early days of the @entity34 - led occupation of @entity6 , security contractors have immunity from @entity6 law			1

" he said it will be important to see whether the @entity57 finds @entity4 itself criminally responsible , or merely a few of its employees			2
" we can terminate contracts for the convenience of the government if we have to , " he said			0
