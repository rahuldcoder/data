-- president @entity1 faces a real dilemma as he prepares for the @entity3			1
most @entity4 believe our country is on the wrong track			1
a majority oppose @entity9 , for a variety of reasons			0
five years into his presidency , there is still a very weak economy , and 74 % of @entity4 believe it feels like we are still in a recession			1
in addition , he has had a terrible year in which his major policy initiative failed spectacularly and his administration was caught misusing the @entity23 against political opponents , many @entity4 were startled to discover the scope of electronic government surveillance and details continued to trickle out about a number of other scandals			2
and 53 % recently indicated they believe the @entity1 administration is simply incompetent			2
the president is now so unpopular in some parts of @entity4 that incumbent democrats hide when he comes to their state			1
the president recently tried moving to the left with rhetoric about income inequality to arouse his base			1
that strategy so alienated independents that the @entity42 is now suggesting the @entity3 will focus on upward mobility and helping people achieve higher incomes through growth ( core @entity48 themes ) rather than on income inequality			1
the @entity1 dilemma is simple			2
he can move to the left and his base will be relatively happy ( except on the @entity53 spying , where they may be the angriest opponents of the president 's policies )			0
but the base is too small to win the @entity59 races this fall			0
he can move to the center , and the base may be bored and stay at home while the independents remain alienated by the economy and @entity9			0
tuesday night , the president will be playing a weak hand			0
he will get a standing ovation a number of times , of course , and the @entity3 is always a spectacle centered on the president			1
most speeches like this have an impact for three days			0
we will see if the president has found a formula that is more effective and lasting			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity79 .			0
