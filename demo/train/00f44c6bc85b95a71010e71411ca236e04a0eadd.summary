the loyalists who were bombing the city " have no problem with the weather conditions there , " referring to unconfirmed reports that @entity10 airstrikes were halted in the area due to weather conditions			1
@entity14 's forces are using @entity26 missiles and mortars , " and sometimes we feel that @entity10 wants to use any excuse out there so they do n't carry out their duties , " he said			1

" we are confident that we will be able to liberate the city completely and rescue our civilians who are being targeted by the madness of @entity14 's death squads , " he said			0
the rebel spokesman also criticized @entity10 's role in @entity44			1
" we still need @entity10 's assistance , but we do n't understand what they are up to , " he said			1
in one instance , rebel fighters pushed back @entity14 's squads to a shoe factory , from where they were bombing residential areas in the city , he said			0
@entity10 refused to bomb the shoe factory because it is a civilian facility , he said			2
in the end , the rebels pushed the loyalists out of the shoe factory , which they burned after abandoning			0

" we want to save our population from being murdered by these merciless death squads			0
earlier , an opposition member said loyalists were using bombs that look like perfume bottles			0
photographs indicated they were shells fired from a grenade launcher that either did not explode on impact or were deliberately masked and placed in populated areas			0
the lethal weapons have blown off people 's limbs and killed children , the council member said saturday			0
the report came a day after @entity88 reported its members saw three cluster bombs explode thursday night in a @entity44 neighborhood			2
the activist group said it inspected debris and interviewed witnesses about two other apparent cluster bombings			0
the @entity1 government has denied the use of such bombs , which are banned internationally because of their indiscriminate nature and ability to harm civilians after a conflict ends			2

" i have a message to @entity10 and to the @entity115 and @entity116 , " a man wrapped in a green flag said saturday night			2
" we say to them , we will kill you if you come to our land			0
" others chanted , " go go @entity122 , " referring to @entity116 president @entity122			0

at least 700 people have died since violence erupted in @entity44 two months ago , a medical director said			2
despite weeks of aerial bombardment by international fighter jets , @entity14 remains defiant and has rebuffed global calls to stop attacks on civilians			0
at a news conference in @entity168 , the deputy chairman of @entity1 's @entity170 appealed to the international community to help prevent further tragedy			1
he said 1.5 million @entity1 were under attack every day			2
" we already have warned before that the regime was threatening real massacres against innocent civilians , " @entity174 told reporters			0
" the international community is now witnessing what this regime is capable of			0
the destruction in @entity44 and other cities is unacceptable			2
