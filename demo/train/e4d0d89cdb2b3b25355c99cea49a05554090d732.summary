@entity0 , @entity1 -- for all the buzz about " tablet computers " in recent weeks , one fundamental question about this supposedly break - through computer category remains unanswered : what exactly is a tablet ? computer industry representatives here at the massive and hype - heavy @entity11 ca n't seem to agree			1
some say a computer just needs a touch - sensitive screen to be a tablet			1
others say a person should be able to write on it with a pen			0
still others say it 's screen size that 's important -- tablets must fit somewhere between phones and laptops			1
for @entity27 , vice president and chief technology officer at @entity29 , it 's partly the keyboard -- a tablet should have one of those			2
break off the keyboard , leaving only a touch - screen device , he said , and the gadget falls into another buzz - worthy category : the slate			1
others say the terms slate and tablet are synonymous			2
so what 's a confused consumer to do ? and how can anyone judge the many products here that claim to be from tabletland when there 's no consensus on what one is ? simple			0
just get over the name , said @entity51 , vice-president of industry analysis at the @entity53 , a market research firm			0
computer makers are introducing a shotgun spray of newish -- or at least newly named -- products in hopes that one will be a big recession - era hit with consumers , he said			1
none of these new devices , which he said are characterized only by their medium size , fix any obvious problem consumers have with their current computers , he said			1
companies are releasing these new products without knowing exactly why consumers would want to use them , he said			2
" that 's the problem , but the exciting part of it is that we really do n't know what the right product is for people -- what they want to do with this			2
" hot products the tablet buzz at @entity11 is somewhat overshadowed by a tablet that @entity83 is rumored to announce later this month			1
still , the array of tablet-esque devices here is getting tons of attention from show attendees			0
the two most talked - about tablets at @entity11 are @entity92 's @entity91 , which the company refers to not as a tablet but as a " hybrid - notebook ; " and a yet - to - be named and largely unseen " slate " tablet from @entity29 @entity92 's device looks like a smallish laptop on first glance			1
but the screen on the gadget pops off of a plastic shell and can be carried around separately from its keyboard			0
that 's the tablet part of the hybrid			2
when separated from its keyboard home , the slender touch - screen tablet -- which looks like a stretched - out @entity110 -- is well suited for watching movies , browsing photos and reading books , said @entity114 , who markets the device			1
the touch - sensitive screen , made possible by @entity118 's @entity117 , lets users spin photos and scroll through text with their fingers , which might seem more intuitive than a pushing a computer mouse			1
watch @entity11 attendees get acquainted with the dual laptop - tablet that product will debut in six months and will cost less than $ 1,000 , @entity114 said			1
@entity118 ceo @entity128 briefly trotted out @entity29 's unnamed " slate " device during his opening keynote address at the show , stirring up lots of interest			2
the device was thin and flat , without a keyboard , and with a touch - sensitive screen			1
@entity29 decided not to show off the unnamed product at @entity11 , however			1
@entity27 , the company 's cto , said the @entity29 slate has been in development for five years and will be sold to consumers sometime in 2010			1
he would not discuss the product 's price or provide further specifics			0
tablet origins part of the tablet confusion comes from the fact that the term is not new			0
in the 90s , @entity118 and others introduced tablet pcs with swivel - around screens and keyboards			1
consumers could n't touch the screens with their fingers to control the tablets , but many had stylus pens that let people write on the screen			1
while popular in niche markets , those older - generation tablets never took off like expected , said @entity165 , editor in chief of @entity167			2
" i think major companies are still a little hesitant to go all - in , " he said			0
why now ? the current resurgence of the tablet term -- and the mid-sized , touch - screen gadgets that go with it -- appears to have several precipitating factors			1
first , said @entity165 , is the popularity of the @entity110			0
@entity83 's smartphone showed people how helpful touch - screen technology can be			1
" i think people got the idea that -- ' well , what if [ the @entity110 ] was bigger ? " he said			2
consumer electronics sales were down considerably in 2009			0
that gives computer companies an incentive to try some potentially wacky ideas in an effort to differentiate themselves from competitors , said @entity51 , the industry analyst			0
technological advances are also pushing the idea			0
@entity194 7 , which @entity118 released last year , incorporates touch - screen technology , and many people consider to be a cornerstone of the tablet experience			1
also throw in a truckload of hype about @entity83 's rumored tablet			0
tech blogs have been drooling over the supposed announcement for months			0
and , while tablet makers here say they 've been working on the technology for years , several admitted the @entity83 tablet buzz does n't hurt their efforts			2
people expect everything @entity83 makes to be sexy and popular			0
and that could rub off on an entire category of devices			0
what 's in a name ? the flurry of newly named computer products , however , could have negative consequences for the tablet computer industry , said @entity220 , vice-president of sales and marketing at viliv , another tablet maker exhibiting at @entity11			1
the industry is on the verge of confusing consumers so much that they wo n't know what products they do or do n't want , he said			0
still , he added , it 's exciting to work in a time of experimentation			0
@entity232 is focusing on a number of mid-size computing devices -- from its $ 500 @entity236 " clamshell " device , which looks like a sunglasses case when it 's closed and is small enough to fit in a coat pocket ; to a $ 550 @entity241 tablet with a swivel touch - screen and a keyboard ; and , finally , a soon - to - be - unveiled " media slate , " which has an 10 - inch touch - screen and no keyboard			1
the names are important from a marketing perspective , he said			0
@entity232 did n't call its " media slate " a tablet because that name sounds expensive , he said			2
the company did n't want to call it a plain old slate either , he said , because that sounded heavy , like slate rock , when the media slate is actually rather light			0
@entity258 also sounds industrial , he said , and he wants this media - consumption device to be fun			0
" we tried to give it a little bit more of a casual , lighter feeling , " he said			0
other companies have introduced mid-sized , pseudo-tablet products under a host of names -- smartbooks , mini-notes , touch - screen netbooks , dual - book e-readers that also surf the @entity273			1
at its @entity11 product office this week , @entity114 , from @entity92 , was commenting on this development when a woman abruptly joined the conversation			2
" i just call it a computer , " she said .			0

tablet computers get buzz at @entity11 , but people disagree about what they are
most are characterized by their size : they are smaller than laptops and bigger than phones
@entity29 says tablets have keyboards and " slate " computers only have touch - screens
computer makers are trying out new categories to see what will stick with consumers
