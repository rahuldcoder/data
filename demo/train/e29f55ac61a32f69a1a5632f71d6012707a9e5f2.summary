-- have you ever been in a heated debate with someone and said this ? " it does n't matter how big your telescope / towed array is , if you are 100nm away you ca n't amplify a signal that was attenuated to zero level before it reached 10nm			2
it does n't matter that there is a ' natural water telescope ' named convergence zone - it would amplify sounds and you would hear even very weak signals of low or medium frequency			2
" not so much ? then you 're probably not an aviation geek			1
( by the way , @entity0 does n't know what the heck that quote actually means , so if you know , leave your translation in the comments section ! ) " @entity34 , " as they affectionately call themselves , have been around for years , but recently their passion has had a mainstream platform as the world continues to be fascinated with the mystery of @entity33			1
some avgeeks are not just talking about the missing plane -- they are trying to unravel what happened to it			1
" the aviation geek movement is having a moment , " said @entity39 , the editor - in - chief of @entity40 , a site he founded in 2008			1
with a day job in higher education , the 33 - year - old started the site as a passion project , in part to remind complaining air travelers that flying is incredible			1
" i fly sometimes for work and i have my times when i 'm not really happy about things , " he said			1
" but then i remind myself how lucky we are to be able to go from one side of the world to the other with relative ease			2
" based in @entity60 , @entity40 has writers located around the globe , all proudly part of the avgeek community			1
though some are industry professionals , others are simply dazzled by the poetics of air travel and the machines that make it possible			2
many talk dreamily about their first air travel experience , as kids lingering near the cockpit , curious about who had the authority and know - how to get such a massive thing off the ground			2
they savor their miniature preheated meals as if they were served at a @entity80 - starred restaurant			2
they always get the window seat			2
flying is magic to them			1
planes are miracles , they 're time machines			1
" come on , " an avgeek will tell you			2
" you can get on a flight from @entity91 , @entity92 , and about 16 hours later step off and be in @entity93 , @entity94 ! is n't that amazing ! ? " since @entity33 disappeared more than a month ago with 239 passengers and crew members aboard , avgeeks have been chatting online about the mystery			1
on one of the most popular sites , airliners.net , posters speculate about what might have happened , some employing complex " @entity104 " - style calculations			2
moderators remind everyone to be nice and to " please keep science fiction theories and content related to past / current movies or possible future movie rights out of these threads			2
" the son of a pilot , @entity39 said that he is sad for what appears to be the tragedy of flight 370 , but pleased to see so much news coverage and avgeek chatter about air travel			1
" i really do n't know what happened			2
but i like that it 's energized people to ask questions and to learn more about the avgeek world			2
" plane spotting one corner of avgeek culture involves the practice of plane spotting , even camping out together to watch for planes as they take off and land			1
spotters note a plane 's unique details , photograph it and post the pics online			2
a few months before the @entity140 plane disappeared , one of these plane spotters , @entity141 , took a photo of a @entity144 777 - 200 at the @entity146 airport			2
he was shocked when he realized he 'd captured an image of the plane -- the same one that flew @entity33 -- after he matched registration numbers			1
about four years ago , 31 - year - old high school librarian @entity149 received a camera as a gift and wanted to practice shooting			2
she ended up at @entity154 's @entity153			2
capturing the same shot over and over seemed like a fantastic way to train her eye , and @entity159 became artistically inspired by the abstract quality of airline logos			2
she also noticed that focusing her camera skyward had a relaxing , almost meditative , effect on her			0
@entity159 is n't interested in learning how to fly , but still , she marvels at the mechanics of flight			1
" i 've also come to appreciate technology so much more -- it 's so cool , " she said			0
" it 's amazing to me that these enormous @entity169 with four engines fly			0
" as for @entity33 , @entity149 wo n't venture a guess about what happened			1
" to me , " she said , " it 's a human tragedy first			0
" flight club but there are plenty of aviation geeks who want to analyze what might have happened			1

the most recent posts discuss the possible origin and nature of the latest pings searchers have heard in the southern @entity225 , where authorities say the plane crashed			0
a network of theories to author , outdoor adventurer and aviation expert @entity229 , those highly technical posts on sites like @entity180 are the most intriguing part of the hunt for @entity33			1

i love that focus , " he said			0
" you 're dealing with challenges that come up in the flight			1
my friends ask me : ' is n't it boring to fly the same routes ? ' no , the weather , the passengers , the flight conditions -- it 's always different			1

i 've had my eyes in the sky for as long as i can remember			0
it just always fascinated me that there were things up there and people in them			1
