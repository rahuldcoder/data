@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 sweeps through chaotic crowds in @entity1 's @entity0 province , hailed in the pandemonium by his supporters as " ar - rayis , " the president			1
in the nation 's first democratic presidential election , @entity3 is one of a few candidates who can boast of any practical government experience			1
he served as foreign minister under @entity15 and headed the @entity16			1
now , he 's one of the top contenders in the voting to be held wednesday and thursday			0
experience , however , can be a thorn in a nation where 18 days of fervent , anti-government uprising last year toppled @entity15 's decades - long dictatorship			1
@entity3 , 75 , is intent on turning that liability into gain			2
" they have to select and elect a president who can do the job , not a president beginner who will just get into learning or quarreling with others , " @entity3 says between campaign stops through @entity1 's @entity28 region			1
and he has been trying to reassure @entity1 that a vote for him is not a betrayal of the revolution			2
" we want to ensure that every citizen in all of @entity1 -- in the north , south , east and west -- that the state is moving in the right way to progress and to respond to people 's requirements , " he said in a televised debate earlier this month			2
@entity3 's message has been resonating with @entity1 in all sectors of society			1
among them the wealthy industrialists and @entity49 who believe @entity3 can help stem the tide of @entity52			2
but @entity3 also has support in poorer , more densely populated provinces , where people long for the stability associated with the old regime			1
" we need a leader to steer this ship and @entity3 can do it , " says @entity58 , a nurse in the @entity28			2
" he 's a diplomat			0
he 's been around the world and can work with other countries to help @entity1			2
" campaign manager @entity65 says supporters see @entity3 as a healing force in a turbulent time			2
" he has been working on issues pertaining to reconciliation all over the @entity16 world for the last decade or two , " @entity65 told @entity69			0
" so this is one of the reasons why he can be instrumental in trying to achieve the objective of reconciliation and healing at a time when @entity1 needs that most			2
" @entity3 graduated in 1957 from @entity79 with a law degree			0
the following year , he joined @entity1 's foreign ministry , launching a long career in diplomacy			1
he served as @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity85 as well as to @entity86 before @entity15 named him foreign minister in 1991			1
@entity3 was popular in that role , channeling anger at @entity1 's peace treaty with @entity91 in his favor with vociferous criticism of his @entity95 neighbors			1
he was even the subject of a popular song in 2000 with these lyrics : " i hate @entity91 but i love @entity3			1
" " you might think that such @entity91 - bashing lyrics would cause some discomfort for an official whose job at the time involved his country 's ultra-sensitive diplomatic relations with the jewish state , " says a 2001 @entity100 story			1
but not for @entity3 apparently			0
" i was kind of gratified , " @entity3 told @entity100 , while puffing on a @entity111 cigar			0
" why should it bother me ? it is a message : we ca n't accept injustice done to the @entity116			0
" the @entity117 described him as " no ordinary @entity1 government official " who " has achieved enormous popularity because of the charismatic style with which he has dealt with the @entity91			1
" @entity3 says his goal now is to reclaim his homeland 's position as the @entity16 world 's most influential nation			2
" my point of reference is @entity1			0
nothing else , " he says in between @entity28 campaign stops in hot , stuffy tents			0
he begins to talk about ways to deal with international treaties but celebratory gunfire drowns his voice , interrupting his thoughts			0
but he has made it clear that his opinions are not those of @entity15 's , including on @entity91			1
" @entity15 had a certain policy , it was his own policy and i do n't think we have to follow this , " @entity3 recently told @entity142			1
" we want to be a friend of @entity91 , but it has to have two parties , it is not on @entity1 to be a friend			1
@entity91 has to be a friend , too			0
" he has frequently been cited as the civilian figure @entity1 would elect as president if they had a real choice , according to @entity142 article			0
@entity15 sent off @entity3 to become secretary - general of the @entity16 in 2001 , a move rife with rumors that the dictator felt threatened by his minister 's popular standing			1
now , with @entity1 's political landscape vastly changed , @entity3 is poised to take the helm			1
but not everyone wants to see him assume the nation 's top job and @entity3 finds himself in a delicate dance with @entity1 's new kingmakers -- the ruling @entity171 and the @entity172			1
both are certain to demand concessions in exchange for support			0
@entity3 is likely the military 's choice , according to @entity179 , senior fellow for @entity181 foreign policy at the @entity182			1
he has " vowed to give the military a voice in key policy decisions through a national security council that would include top military officers , " @entity183 wrote in a @entity2 commentary			0
in many ways , the election is a battle between an @entity172 vision of @entity1 and a more secular , nationalist one			0
a chunk of @entity1 favor a stronger role for @entity172			0
@entity3 is not their man			0
@entity3 runs into some of his opposition in the @entity28 , where some accuse him of being a " faloul , " a derogatory term for a holdover from the @entity15 regime			1
one young man defiantly displays a poster of @entity208 , the candidate of the formerly banned @entity209			0
above , on a balcony , a veiled woman and her children show their disapproval with a thumbs down			0
campaigning is a new thing for people in the @entity28 , and for that matter , everywhere in @entity1 , and @entity3 is determined to meet voters , go places where @entity15 never did			1
he has visited each of @entity1 's 27 governorates during his presidential campaign			2
on some of his campaign stops , the voices of the people are louder than his			0
they demand youth employment , relief for indebted farmers and an end to corruption			0
@entity3 carries on amid a cacophony of fireworks , horns , loudspeakers and the distinct roar of the crowd			0
and hopes that it will pay off at the polls			0
@entity2 's @entity240 reported from @entity0 province , @entity1 , and @entity242 reported from @entity243 .			2

@entity3 has had a long diplomatic career
he gained popularity by criticizing @entity91 when he was @entity15 's foreign minister
he appeals to a wide *spectrum* of @entity1 voters
he says @entity1 needs a leader with experience but some see him as a regime holdover
