-- a poor workman often blames his tools , and every four years the official @entity4 football seems to provide the perfect excuse for poor play			1
as balls go , the ones created for soccer 's showpiece tournament have often fallen a bit flat			2
at the 2002 tournament the @entity12 was deemed too light ; four years later the @entity14 was judged too heavy -- and then came the unloved @entity15 ... compared to a " beach ball " by @entity18 goalkeeper @entity17 , called " dreadful " by @entity20 counterpart @entity19 and described as " very complicated " by @entity22 's star striker @entity21 -- who had actually been enlisted to help promote the ball -- the @entity15 left the 2010 tournament with a deflated reputation			2
so it 's over to the @entity28 -- a colloquial term used to describe pride in the @entity32 way of life -- to pump up pride for @entity36 manufacturer @entity35 , which has been official ball supplier for the world 's biggest sporting event since 1970			1
like those that have gone before it , the @entity28 is debuting innovative technology , as @entity44 hosts the @entity4 for the first time since 1978			1
it is formed from six identical panels -- two fewer than @entity48 's @entity15 -- which are glued together at a certain level of heat and pressure			1
but the @entity28 has another important design difference which could kick the problems of its predecessors into touch			2
" as soon as i got hold of the ball i could see how different it was from the previous two , " says dr. @entity57 , a research fellow at the @entity58 at @entity60 's @entity59			0
" @entity35 have come up with a design where they 've got a deeper and longer seam between the panels than on the @entity67 , " he told @entity0			1
" it seems strange to say , but this is an innovation because it 's more like the traditional , hand - stitched football where the seam is quite prominent on the ball			2
" that seam size and the depth are really important in terms of how the ball behaves aerodynamically			0
" @entity57 said the @entity15 " misbehaved " because of the smoothness it gained through its thermal bonding process			0
" the player would strike the ball , and in certain regions of the ball the air was chaotic and in others the air was smooth , " he explains			2
" that creates an imbalance in the forces , so the ball tends to get pushed upwards or sideways or downwards			0
" with the @entity28 you wo n't get that patchiness of air , you wo n't have areas of turbulent or smooth flow , and that will lead to its trajectory being more predictable , more like a normal football			1
" it might be better than other balls in how it consistently rolls , and traveling through the air i think it will be more like the footballs that the players are used to in their domestic leagues			1
" @entity35 is taking nothing for granted and has applied a policy of " practice makes perfect " to make sure its @entity4 match ball is a success			1
it is even calling the @entity28 " the most tested ball @entity35 has ever produced " -- and it has the statistics to prove it			1
" it was tested in 10 countries , across three continents by more than 600 players and 30 teams , " @entity117 , @entity35 business unit director of football , explained to @entity0			1
" the @entity28 was tested by teams including @entity22 and @entity18 , @entity124 and @entity125 and current players such as @entity21 and @entity17			2
" it was also tested in @entity32 's diverse seasons and climate conditions			0
we tested it in june and july in various cities to replicate the conditions and temperatures during the tournament			2
" the ball was also tested at altitude , at 1300m in @entity138 and 1600m in @entity139 in the @entity140			2
" it was also tested on dry , slightly damp and very wet pitches , and in windy conditions , gusts and heavy rain			0
" after such a huge tick list , it is no surprise that the @entity28 has received positive reviews from many of the players who hope to kick and curl it to @entity4 glory over the next month			1
" the weight is really good , which tells me it 's going to be a very reliable and true ball , " says @entity20 midfielder and captain @entity153 , who is sponsored by @entity35			2
" the players want to try to be as accurate as they can with the ball , and we get a better chance of doing that if the weight 's right because it does what you ask it to do			0
" four - time world player of the year @entity21 said in a similar press release : " my first impression of the ball is that it 's really good			0
" even @entity169 contracted players such as @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 have praised the ball in the buildup to the tournament			2
the first batch of @entity178 were dropped off to all 32 national federations competing in the @entity4 in time for @entity180 last year			0
in may , the 4,000 official match balls to be used arrived in @entity32 and the training balls were , in turn , handed over to each federation when they arrived at their warmup camps			0
with such meticulous planning , the players have had plenty of time to get used to the @entity28 , but will armchair football fans be able to tell one ball from another ? " if a piece of sports equipment is doing its job , you wo n't notice it , " says @entity57 , who has spent much of his career analyzing the behavior of footballs and tennis racquets			1
" previously when these balls wobbled in the air they made the job hard for goalkeepers , so there were more goals , and that 's quite good for the person at home watching			0
" @entity35 has remedied that behavior so i 'm predicting the @entity28 is not going to do anything completely crazy or unexpected , so maybe we wo n't notice as much			1
" if the @entity28 does have any hidden idiosyncrasies , then the @entity4 's most gifted players could still turn them to their advantage			1
" when the football at one of the previous @entity219 started behaving strangely and wobbling in a certain way @entity222 's @entity221 learned how to kick the ball in that way repeatedly , " @entity57 explains			0
. " so if a piece of equipment starts behaving differently it potentially gives the player an advantage			0
" the best players wo n't complain about it -- they 'll exploit it and use it to their advantage			0
" once he had learned to control the ball , @entity221 saw it was a big advantage and he started scoring lots of free kicks			0
" but for those without the rare ability to bend the ball like @entity221 and @entity21 , could a perfect football be created ? " maybe as technology progresses , we can do away with seams altogether and start with a blank canvas , " @entity57 predicts			0
" manufacturers will be able to choose ball behavior themselves by adding indented roughness			0
" i imagine a future where you can make a football that 's marble smooth and then you press in the roughness and seams like adding dimples to a golf ball			0
" even if the perfect football was conceived and created , there may never be such a thing as a universal ball -- at least not in today 's competitive , commercial market			0
the raison d'etre for the @entity14 , the @entity67 and the @entity28 is to showcase @entity35 technology and create demand for an exciting new product in front of a global audience			1
world football 's governing body @entity267 is expecting 3.2 billion people to watch some portion of the month - long tournament			0
as long as @entity35 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and other rival companies are competing to sell sports equipment , then a football with universal match appeal will remain as elusive as the gold @entity4 trophy itself			1
as for the @entity28 , no matter how consistently it performs in @entity32 , its fate on future football fields has already been decided			1
after the tournament the match balls rolled out in @entity32 will become another @entity35 marketing tool used in giveaways , exhibitions and retails			1
the march of technology and the demand of the dollar means in many ways the @entity28 has already been consigned to history before the @entity4 kicks off .			1

the @entity28 will be in the *spotlight* as the new @entity4 football for the 2014 tournament
the ball is comprised of just six identical panels which are thermally glued together
to avoid *controversy* of past @entity4 balls , @entity35 has rigorously tested @entity28
*science* experts predict it will roll and travel through the air more consistently
