-- newly released documents have reignited the debate in @entity3 over whether @entity5 administration officials granted too much access to filmmakers making a movie about the raid that killed @entity10 -- and whether national security was compromised in the process			1
the documents show , for example , that a defense official offered the filmmakers access to a planner from @entity17 , the super-secret special ops division that successfully executed the high - stakes raid in @entity20 last year			1
it is not clear if any such access eventually took place			2
but according to a transcript from the meeting , in july of last year , @entity25 @entity24 told screenwriter @entity28 and director @entity29 that the defense department would offer up a plum interview			2
" they 'll make a guy available who was involved from the beginning as a planner ; a seal team 6 operator and commander , " @entity24 said , according to the transcript			0
the name of that man is blacked out in the transcript that was released , and @entity24 tells the filmmakers not to reveal the man 's identity			1
" he should n't be talking out of school , " @entity24 says , but " he knows what he can and ca n't say			0
" " that 's dynamite , " says @entity28 , according to the transcript			0
" that 's incredible , " says @entity29			0
" you 're going to get a little bit of operational stuff , " @entity24 says , " but more really policy -- like how did we make the decision , the risks , that kind of stuff			2
" it was not clear whether the seal team commander ever met with the filmmakers			2
a @entity61 spokesman said the @entity61 gave them no access to classified information about the raid			1
but rep. @entity65 , @entity67 - @entity66 , chairman of the @entity68 , says the offer of access looks like a " potentially dangerous collaboration " and raises " very serious questions " about whether the administration is sufficiently protecting operational secrets			1
" if this is too sensitive for the average person to know about , " @entity65 said , " did @entity29 have security clearance ? is she cleared to go in there ? " @entity79 , former @entity80 homeland security adviser under president @entity81 and a @entity0 contributor , called the revelations " troubling			1
" she said revealing too much information about how the @entity10 raid was planned and executed could help other terrorists escape attempts to capture them			1
" the understanding of how that happens is really very important to our enemies because then they know which information to withhold from us , " she said			0
" we do n't want to make that mission -- attacking or targeting future @entity95 leaders -- any more difficult than it already is			0
" " there 's a real downside to giving too much access to @entity99 , " she said			2
the records were released to the @entity3 watchdog organization @entity101 , after it filed a @entity103 lawsuit			2
according to e-mails among the documents , the filmmakers also met with acting cia director @entity107 , national security council chief of staff @entity109 , and @entity80 counterterrorism adviser @entity110			1
the records also suggest that they were given a walk - though of the " vault " room used by the @entity114 when planning the raid			0
doctor linked to raid sent to prison a @entity114 spokesperson confirmed that @entity114 officers sometimes to meet with writers and filmmakers to help make the portrayal of the @entity114 more accurate , but called those meetings unclassified			1
the spokesperson added that " the ' vault ' in question , that had been used for planning the raid , was empty at the time of the filmmakers ' visit			1
" likewise , @entity80 officials have said they did not give the filmmakers anything that was not also provided to journalists			0
" the same information was given to the @entity80 press corps , " said @entity135 spokesman @entity134			0
" we do not discuss classified information			0
" administration officials have also rejected suggestions that they were hoping that a movie recounting the daring and successful raid ordered by president @entity5 would burnish his image just when the presidential campaign reached its height			2
the released documents show that the political strategy firm @entity149 , which has ties to @entity151 , helped the filmmakers arrange meetings in @entity3			1
" to have @entity151 consultants , lobbyists , having access with @entity99 producers to inner workings of the @entity114 , of the military , raises very serious questions , " said @entity154 rep. @entity65			1
but the filmmakers , whose representatives declined to comment wednesday , have said in the past that the film would be about a nonpartisan @entity167 triumph without regard for political affiliation			0
and while the release of the film had once been anticipated for october , just weeks before @entity172 , its release is not expected until december			0
@entity0 's @entity175 , @entity176 , and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
