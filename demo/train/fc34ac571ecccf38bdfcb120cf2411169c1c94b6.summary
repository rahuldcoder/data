@entity0 , @entity1 -- scientists are claiming they have discovered a new species of monkey living in the remote forests of the @entity7 -- an animal well - known to local hunters but until now , unknown to the outside world			1
in a paper published wednesday in the open - access journal @entity14 , the scientists describe the new species that they call @entity16 , known locally as the @entity16 , whose home is deep in central @entity7 's @entity19 forest basin			1
the scientists say it is only the second discovery of a monkey species in 28 years			1
in an age where so much of the earth 's surface has been photographed , digitized , and placed on a searchable map on the web discoveries like this one by a group of @entity30 scientists this seem a throwback to another time			0
who 's the monkey ? see @entity16 's famous lookalikes " we never expected to find a new species there , " says @entity39 , the lead scientist of the project , " but the @entity19 basin is a very large block that has had very little exploration by biologists			1
" @entity39 says that the rigorous scientific process to determine the new species started with a piece of luck , strong field teams , and an unlikely field sighting in a small forest town			1
" our @entity7 field teams were on a routine stop in @entity54			1
it is the closest settlement of any kind to the area of forest we were working in , " says @entity39			0
the team came across a strange looking monkey tethered to a post			1
it was the pet of @entity64 , the daughter of the local school director			0
she adopted the young monkey when its mother was killed by a hunter in the forest			2
her father said it was a @entity16 , well - known to hunters in that part of the forest			1
the field team took pictures and showed them to @entity39			1
" right away i saw that this was something different			0
it looked a bit like a monkey from much further east , but the coloring was so different and the range was so different , " said @entity39			2
the monkey to the east is the semi-terrestrial owl - faced monkey			2
based on the photos , @entity39 believed that their shape and size could be similar , but their morphology or outward appearance was very distinct			0
the @entity16 had strikingly large , almost human like , eyes , a pink face and golden mane			1
far to the east , across several large river systems , the @entity97 is aptly named			0
its sunken eyes are set deep in a dark face , a white stripe running down from its brow to its mouth , like a line of chalk on a blackboard			0
to a layman it looks like an open and shut case			0
but animals are often widely divergent within a species -- humans are an obvious example -- so @entity39 and his team needed science to prove their gut feeling			1
" i got in touch with geneticists and anthropologists to get their advice			0
i knew it was important to have a collaborative team of experts , " says @entity39			2
the exhaustive study took three years			2
@entity39 's teams set up digital sound recorders in the forests to record the morning calls of the @entity97 and @entity16 monkeys			1
they analyzed the ecology of the forest and behavior of the shy and difficult to observe monkey			2
field teams collected @entity16 specimens from hunters and monkeys freshly killed by leopards and once , a crowned eagle ( the field worker had to wait for the eagle to leave its perch , says @entity39 )			1
the specimens were shipped to two research centers in the @entity146 and the data shared with labs across the country			0
@entity150 , an anthropologist based at @entity151 in @entity152 , says the difference in appearance between the @entity16 and @entity97 was striking			1
" after comparing the skins , we immediately concluded that this was probably something different [ than ] we had seen before , " says @entity150 , an expert in primate and monkey evolution			2
skulls of the @entity16 and @entity97 monkey were measured with calipers and digitally drawn in @entity163			1
" we looked at the difference in shape and a number of landmarks in the skulls , " says @entity150			0
previously on @entity2 : new species discovered in @entity30 jungle while the @entity97 and @entity16 had similar sized skulls , he says , the @entity16 had significantly larger orbits and several other small , but statistically significant , differences in the hard anatomy of the skull			1
the anatomical studies are backed up by genetics			0
scientists at @entity180 and @entity181 were able trace an ancient common ancestor			0
scientists believe the monkeys evolved separately after a series of rivers separated their habitats			0
" the clincher was that lab and field teams were able to document significant difference in conjunction with the genetics			0
the monkeys were different and have been different for a couple of million years			0
it demonstrates that there are places in the world that we do not know much about , " says @entity150			0
the @entity16 's range covers an area of about 6,500 square miles ( 17,000 square kilometers ) between the @entity202 and @entity203			1
until recently , it was one of the @entity7 's least biologically explored forest blocks			1
@entity39 hopes that the announcement will bring a renewed effort to save central @entity210 's pristine forests			0
under threat by loggers , bush meat hunters , and weak national governments , the forests are a potential well of important scientific discoveries , and a key linchpin of the earth 's biodiversity			0
@entity221 and @entity39 's @entity222 is working with the @entity7 authorities to establish a national park in the @entity226 basin before it loses its unique biodiversity			2
" the challenge now is to make the @entity16 an iconic species that carries the message for conservation of all of @entity7 's endangered fauna , " says @entity39			1
and what of the first @entity16 they found -- @entity64 's pet			2
after he saw the pictures , @entity39 regularly sent a team to keep track of the young @entity16 's progress			1
at some point @entity64 let the monkey roam free			0
" it seems someone captured it , " says @entity39 , " it probably ended up in the cooking pot. " he hopes that with proper protection , the @entity16 , and the rest of @entity249 's incredible animal biodiversity , wo n't suffer a similar fate			2
2011 : ' @entity252 ' stars in book of newly discovered species			0

new monkey discovery is only second such find in 28 years
@entity16 , or @entity259 , lives in remote forests of @entity7
the find began with luck when a field team saw a strange monkey in a remote town
it took three years to *confirm* the monkey was actually a new species
