-- when all you 've got is a hammer , everything looks like a nail			0
in business , that hammer is money and the nail is employee productivity			2
employees at most companies are offered higher salaries or year - end bonuses in exchange for better output			1
businesses better get some new tools quickly , because this hammer is not enough to get the job done			0
countless employees are unhappy , reporting that they only work for the money and yet would trade a raise for a better boss and work environment			1
this is not a recipe for long term success			0
anyone who wants to motivate employees needs to understand what motivates people in general			2
people certainly want more money so they can afford more of life 's indulgences and have some protection against life 's inevitable hazards			1
but that is only part of the story			0
in my new book , " @entity45 : why our brains are wired to connect , " i suggest that our brains are wired with another set of motivations , social motivations , that are just as fundamental as those that guide us towards physical pleasures and away from physical pains			1
when we are socially rejected or threatened , we feel a kind of social pain , which activates the same brain regions that register the distress of physical pain			1
taking @entity62 even reduces the brain 's response to social pain			1
on the flip side , fair treatment , praise from others , and even the opportunity to help someone in need are all socially rewarding and activate the brain 's most primitive pleasure centers			1
because infants depend on these social motivations in order to receive the care they need to survive , these urges are built into our operating system and stay with us for a lifetime			2
this has serious consequences for the workplace			2
if companies do not create socially rewarding environments , it is sure to affect the bottom line			2
one study found that individuals who were made to feel rejected scored 15 % lower on an iq test			0
we can understand why someone who just broke their leg would score lower -- how could they possibly focus when experiencing intense pain ? yet , the same is true of social injuries because all pain grabs our attention leaving less attention for other important things			1
in contrast , praising employees may have many of the same motivational consequences as giving a raise , but at little cost to the company			0
one study has found that employees were willing to give up almost $ 30,000 in yearly salary to be recognized for high praise at work			1
another study found that when employees were able to see firsthand how their work was helping others , their productivity more than doubled			1
being reminded of how their work was advancing their own careers had no effect			0
of course , we do n't just blindly seek out social connection			0
we have powerful mind reading abilities that help us pursue these connections more successfully			0
we understand the meaning of a sly smile or a furrowed brow and sarcastic humor is not lost on most of us			0
we are masters of moving from others ' visible signs to the invisible thoughts , feelings , and goals motivating other people			0
this mind reading ability allows us to work well in teams together by predicting the needs of others around us and acting accordingly			0
even though thinking about the physical world and thinking about the mental worlds of other people do n't really feel like profoundly different kinds of thinking , recent brain imaging has shown that there are separate brain systems for these two kinds of thinking			1
in fact , the brain regions supporting social and analytical thinking mostly function like a neural seesaw such that when one increases in activity , the other decreases			1
this presents a problem in the workplace because we place such a premium on analytical thinking ; we typically promote analytical problem solving at the expense of social problem solving , even though both are critically important			2
creating strong social networks in a company affect the bottom line just as much as the analytical abilities and training of the people within those networks			0
nowhere is the importance of social thinking more evident than in our leaders			0
a large recent survey found that leaders who are rated highly on being analytic and results focused are unlikely to be seen as great leaders , but if those same leaders also possess strong social skills , their chance of being seen as a great leader skyrockets			0
it is then deeply troubling to find that only the tiniest fraction of leaders are seen as possessing both kinds of skills			0
money matters in the workplace -- there is no denying it			1
but money is n't the only thing that matters			2
our brains are built for connecting and as more companies begin to recognize this , the positive changes they bring to the workplace will help employees to work smarter , happier , and more productively			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr @entity204 .			1

human brain is rewarded for connections with others , writes dr @entity204
social pain is just as valid as physical pain , according to @entity204 's new book
socially - motivated employees creates happier and more productive workplace
studies show *recognition* at work matters more than money to employees
