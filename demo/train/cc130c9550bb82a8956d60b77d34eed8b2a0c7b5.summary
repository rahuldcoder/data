-- events in @entity2 and @entity3 have alarmed @entity5 attorney general @entity4			1
extremists from the @entity7 in @entity2 and @entity3 control vast swaths of @entity2 and @entity3			1
its members may be mingling with @entity12 bomb makers who have a track record of getting devices on @entity17 planes			0
and thousands of @entity18 have gone to @entity3 ready to give up their lives			1
@entity4 has voiced " extreme concern " that the volatile mix could spread to @entity17 shores			1
" it 's more frightening than anything i think i 've seen as attorney general , " he told @entity23			1
here are five reasons why the fight in @entity3 and @entity2 could spill over to the @entity30			1
@entity31 has the manpower , money and know - how to hit the @entity30 , if it decides to the nightmare scenario is that @entity31 leaders or other terrorist groups in @entity2 and @entity3 launch attacks in the @entity30			1
they are well - positioned to unleash such carnage if they choose			0
many of at least 2,000 @entity18 militants who have traveled to @entity3 joined isis			1
that has given groups the opportunity to train them and send them back home to launch attacks			1
a number have crossed into @entity2			2
these @entity18 fighters also could pose a threat to the @entity5 because many @entity18 do not need a visa to enter the @entity5 about 100 @entity5 also have traveled to fight in @entity3 -- one carried out a suicide bombing in may			1
so far , though , @entity31 and its fierce rival , the @entity3 @entity56 affiliate @entity57 , have not seen attacking the @entity30 as anything near a priority			1
their focus instead has been on fighting the regime of @entity3 president @entity63 and expanding their zone of operations in the region			2
the political turmoil brought about by the @entity68 has made the ultimate dream of global jihadists -- the adoption of their kind of @entity75 rule across the @entity77 world -- seem tantalizingly close			0
attacking the @entity30 , which for @entity56 leaders was always a means to this end , has become something of a sideshow			2
@entity31 -- a group previously known as @entity56 in @entity2 -- has never prioritized targeting @entity17 soil , instead preferring to focus on fighting " infidels " at home			2
in the decade since the @entity87 terrorist @entity86 created the group , it has not been directly behind any plot on @entity17 soil			0
by contrast , in the decade after the september 11 terrorist attacks , @entity56 operatives in @entity92 tribal areas provided wave after wave of @entity17 recruits training on how to make bombs out of chemicals and components readily available in home improvement and beauty supply stores in the @entity30			1
to date , only one suspected @entity31 recruit who has returned to @entity18 is alleged to have built such a device			2
in february , @entity106 police arrested a man they identified as @entity108 , a 23 - year - old @entity106 - @entity109 , and retrieved three soda cans filled with nearly a kilogram ( about 2 pounds ) of the high explosive tatp from his @entity114 apartment			0
@entity106 police suspect that in the 18 months he fought in @entity3 , he learned how to make @entity112 , an unstable and difficult - to - transport high explosive used to build detonators in multiple @entity56 plots against the @entity30			1
it is not clear if @entity31 signed off on his alleged plot			0
while some @entity17 recruits are taught how to make improvised explosive devices in @entity3 , there is little indication yet that the group has created a training program tailored to attacking the @entity30			1
the worry is that that could change			0
after a decade of insurgency in @entity2 , no other group has more expertise in making improvised explosive devices			2
if the @entity5 launches strikes to weaken @entity31 , the group could strike back at the @entity30 , financing attacks with the tens of millions of dollars in its cash reserves			1
last month , its supporters launched a @entity140 campaign -- # @entity141 -- warning of such attacks			0
but , if @entity31 is able to consolidate its territorial gains , it could set up training camps to rival any run by @entity56 in @entity147 before 9/11			0
it 's a @entity148 that worries @entity5 officials			1
" there 's going to be a diaspora out of @entity3 at some point , and we are determined not to let lines be drawn from @entity3 today to a future 9/11 , " fbi director @entity150 warned in may			2
expert @entity12 bomb makers may be mingling with like - minded @entity157 in @entity3 @entity5 officials worry about @entity12 bomb makers who are skilled in making explosive devices that are difficult to detect at airport security			1
the fear is that they are sharing their knowledge with terrorist groups in @entity3 with significant numbers of @entity17 passport holders in their ranks			2
@entity4 called it a potentially " deadly combination			0
" @entity170 , the ingenious chief bomb maker for @entity56 in the @entity172 , a @entity12 @entity56 affiliate , is thought to have trained a cadre of apprentices			0
early this year , @entity5 officials became worried that some may have traveled to @entity3			1
hundreds of @entity12 have traveled to fight there , and officials worry that @entity178 and @entity57 are building ties			2
with @entity31 dominating headlines and winning the battle for new recruits , it is possible that @entity56 affiliates may try to restore their relevance by planning a spectacular attack			0
@entity187 built the " underwear " device that a recruit partially detonated on a plane over @entity191 on christmas day in 2009			0
since then , he has built increasingly sophisticated devices and has experimented with new designs for a shoe bomb			0
but @entity178 has recruited relatively few westerners into its ranks , limiting -- at least until now -- its bomb makers ' ability to target @entity17 aviation			0
but there is concern that @entity170 's knowledge is spreading more widely			2
this month , the @entity205 said a @entity206 convert , @entity204 , had received extensive instruction in explosives after joining @entity178 in @entity12			0
it was not made clear whether this training was provided personally by @entity170			0
nor was it said where the @entity206 is now thought to be			0
@entity17 fighters who leave @entity3 could lash out back home what most keeps @entity18 counterterrorism officials awake at night is the potential threat from hundreds of extremists who have returned home after fighting with terrorist groups in @entity3			1
while little evidence has emerged so far that @entity31 or @entity57 has directed them to launch attacks , their urban warfare skills would make them especially dangerous			2
the first terrorist attack on @entity17 soil linked to @entity3 probably followed this trajectory			2
in may , @entity229 , a @entity106 - @entity109 , allegedly gunned down four people at a @entity232 museum in @entity233 , @entity234 , after spending a year in @entity3			2
when he was arrested , police discovered a @entity236 in his possession wrapped in a flag with @entity31 insignia			0
after the attack , an @entity31 fighter said on social media that he had joined the group , but @entity31 itself did not claim responsibility , suggesting to investigators that he planned the attack himself			0
" the threat of attacks has never been greater -- not at the time of 9/11 , not after the war in @entity2 -- never , " a @entity18 counterterrorism official told @entity0 last month			1
he envisaged a flood of small - scale but effective and chilling attacks similar to the @entity233 shooting			0
@entity18 counterterrorism officials are worried the gains made by @entity31 in @entity2 will lead to a surge of travel to the region			1
in identifying who has traveled , they are often playing catch - up			0
" in most cases , we know within two weeks a guy has gone to @entity3			2
but 10 to 15 percent of the time , it can be several months before we figure it out			0
inevitably , there will be some we have no idea about , " one official told @entity0			0
but even those they know about are difficult to track			0
@entity229 was on a watch list when he returned to @entity18			2
@entity18 officials tell @entity0 it is impossible to conduct 24 - hour surveillance on all but a small fraction of people who have returned from @entity3 because of the prohibitive expense			1
would - be jihadists could become radicalized ' lone wolves ' the @entity279 bombings illustrated the danger posed by extremists learning bomb - making skills over the internet without having to travel to jihadist encampments overseas			1
@entity18 officials say anger about events in @entity3 and @entity2 and excitement about the gains made by @entity31 have spiked radicalization to unprecedented levels across the continent			1
though the animus is not directed as squarely against the @entity30 as it was during the @entity2 war , @entity31 's viscerally anti-western ideology is attracting a growing following in extremist circles in @entity18			1
officials worry that anger " trigger events " such as future @entity5 strikes in @entity2 or the arrests of fighters returning from @entity3 could result in lone - wolf attacks			1
anger about events in @entity304 could be another			0
foreign fighters who go home could build terror networks of their own around 7,000 foreign fighters have traveled to fight in @entity3 , many from the @entity77 world			1
this could see " blowback " across the region as fighters return to their home countries and build up jihadist terrorist groups			0
like in @entity147 two decades ago , fighters are building personal relationships in this melting pot that will form the basis of the transnational terrorist networks of the future			0
for example , a battalion of hardened jihadists from eastern @entity325 is fighting alongside @entity31 in @entity3 while @entity328 @entity31 recruits have returned to the @entity329 , bolstering militant groups there			0
now that @entity56 has largely switched its operations from the @entity147 - @entity92 border region to the @entity77 world , officials fear that its various affiliates in the region will increasingly coordinate and pool resources , creating a significant long - term security threat on the doorstep of @entity18 .			1

@entity5 attorney general : there 's " extreme concern " that @entity344 *bloodshed* could spread to @entity30
@entity18 militants who have traveled to @entity3 could go back home and launch attacks
so far , militants in @entity2 and @entity3 have *n't* seen attacking the @entity30 as a priority
but officials also fear the conflict could create new terror ties , bomb *technology* , lone wolves
