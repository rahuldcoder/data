@entity0 -- @entity4 , the convicted assassin of @entity5 , will make a personal appearance before a @entity8 parole board for the first time in at least nine years on wednesday , supported by two psychologists ' reports saying he no longer poses a threat to society , his attorney said			1
and in what a prosecutor and @entity4 's attorney say will be an extraordinary appearance , one of the surviving shooting victims in the 1968 assassination , retired tv journalist @entity15 , is expected to tell the parole panel that he wo n't object to @entity4 's release if the board oks it , @entity15 told @entity1			1
even so , the release of @entity4 , 66 , now serving a life sentence , is a long shot , with only about 10 % of @entity8 's life - sentenced convicts being granted parole , said @entity32 deputy district attorney @entity31 , who added he plans to oppose @entity4 's release at wednesday 's hearing			1
@entity15 , who shared with @entity1 his prepared statement to the parole board , said he was hit by a stray bullet in the abdomen " on that terrible evening " a quarter past midnight on june 5 , 1968 , after @entity5 had just won the @entity8 primary in his bid for the @entity42 presidential nomination			1
now 73 , @entity15 , of @entity43 , @entity8 , was an @entity45 associate producer at the time of the shooting			0
" i 'm advised that two reputable psychologists , one representing the state of @entity8 and the other from @entity51 , have concluded , after examining him -- @entity4 -- that if he is granted parole , he would not be a threat to himself and others and the community at large			1
if this is a fact and the board is inclined to grant him parole after him being in prison for nearly 43 years , i would not be opposed to the decision , " @entity15 said in a telephone interview with @entity1			1
@entity31 declined to comment on @entity15 's statement or on the psychologists ' reports to the parole board , but he said @entity15 's scheduled appearance would mark the first time during @entity4 's imprisonment that a surviving witness voiced no objection to his possible parole -- at least since 1970			1
prior to 1970 , " there 's no record of the proceedings and i do n't know if anyone showed up , " @entity31 said			0
" it 's fairly unusual			0
it 's not common , " @entity31 added with respect to victims attending a parole hearing and not objecting to the prisoner being released			2
" we do n't get many , at least in cases in @entity32 -- where we get victims or victims ' next of kin coming to cases			0
it 's an expensive proposition			0
" wednesday will mark @entity4 's 14th parole hearing , scheduled to be held in the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity8 , which is 200 miles northwest of downtown @entity0			1
members of the @entity5 family and their representatives did n't return messages or e-mails seeking a comment			2
@entity4 's attorney , @entity101 , an international human rights attorney and a barrister with offices in @entity104 and @entity105 , said he and @entity4 were " very grateful " for @entity15 's statement			1
@entity4 , 63 , is serving a life sentence for killing @entity5 and wounding five other persons in the kitchen pantry of the @entity110 in @entity0 -- the hotel was later razed and a public school now occupies the site			1
@entity4 was convicted of first - degree murder and five counts of assault with attempt to commit murder			2
four of those five surviving victims are alive , including @entity15			2
the others are @entity121 , a @entity5 family friend and former @entity123 regional leader ; @entity124 , a former radio journalist ; and @entity126 , a friend of the late @entity127			2
a @entity129 who was born in @entity131 and whose parents brought him and his siblings to @entity134 in the 1950s , @entity4 killed @entity5 because of statements the @entity104 senator made about the @entity134 sending fighter jets to aid @entity138 , prosecutors argued during @entity4 's 1969 trial			1
in 1968 , sen. @entity5 , younger brother of the assassinated @entity134 president @entity140 , was a leading contender for the @entity42 presidential nomination against vice president @entity142 and sen. @entity143			1
@entity5 was shot only minutes after claiming victory over @entity143 in a hotel ballroom speech televised live to @entity134 households			2
the @entity5 shooting in the hotel 's kitchen pantry only moments later was not captured by any cameras			1
@entity4 was the only person arrested in the shooting			1
@entity4 has @entity154 citizenship but never became a @entity134 citizen , so if the parole board were to release him , he would be deemed an illegal immigrant and deported to @entity154 , where he has extended family , his attorney said			1
@entity4 's younger brother , @entity160 , 63 , continues to live in the @entity8 community where the @entity4 family siblings were raised , @entity159 said			2
@entity4 " has maintained a good relationship with his brother and he would love to live with this brother in @entity166 , but that 's very unlikely because of his immigration status , " @entity101 said			2
@entity169 , an associate clinical professor in psychology at @entity171 , has submitted a statement to the parole board after interviewing @entity4 for 60 hours over a three - year period , @entity101 said			1
" the report is part of a sealed file , but i can say that @entity4 does not have any violent tendency that should be regarded as a threat to the community , " @entity101 said			1
@entity169 's report " confirms @entity4 's legitimacy of the loss of his memory , " including in the pantry during the shooting and in moments of his life in the year prior to the @entity5 slaying , @entity101 said			1
" @entity4 has at various times taken responsibility ( for the @entity5 assassination ) , but the actual fact is that he does n't remember what happened in the pantry at all			1
but because everyone around there told him he did it and he had a pistol and he did fire that pistol , he came to believe that he was actually guilty , " @entity101 said			0
@entity4 shows no sign of mental illness and has demonstrated remorse for the shootings , @entity101 said			2
@entity4 has been " free of any disciplinary rulings against him " in prison , @entity101 said			2
" he 's said no day of his life goes by where he does n't have remorse and deep regret that this took place and the role he played in this thing , " @entity101 said			0
" he 's not schizophrenic or psychotic , and he has not shown any history of violence during incarceration			0
" @entity101 said he became @entity4 's pro bono attorney in the fall of 2007 after he learned of the results of an audio analysis conducted on a sound track of the @entity5 shooting			1
the audio recording , made 40 feet away from the crime scene by free - lance newspaper reporter @entity228 , is the only known recording of the gunshots in that june 1968 assassination			0
@entity101 said he believes the @entity228 recording is evidence showing that there was a second gun firing in addition to @entity4 's @entity238 handgun			2
the tape was uncovered in 2004 by @entity1 's @entity240 , who had the recording independently examined by two audio analysts , @entity243 in @entity244 , @entity245 , and @entity246 in @entity247 , @entity248			0
@entity240 reported on their separate findings for @entity1 's backstory in june 2009			0
watch @entity240 's report from 2009 but the parole board wo n't hear arguments on the second - gun evidence , @entity101 said			1
rather , the parole panel will focus on @entity4 's suitability for parole , he said			1
the @entity228 recording " clearly showed that 13 shots were fired in the pantry , and @entity4 's gun had only eight shots , so it definitely means there was a second shooter , " @entity101 said			2
but @entity15 , joined by authorities who have dismissed the second - gun assertion , said he was convinced that @entity4 was a lone gunman			2
" i 've seen so many theories after 43 years			0
please -- i think you can have a conspiracy in a dictatorship and some countries , but i do n't think so in a democracy or our country where there is freedom of speech , " @entity15 said			0
however , another shooting victim sees it differently than @entity280 : @entity121			0
he is a @entity5 friend who was shot in the forehead while standing immediately behind @entity5 in the pantry			0
in 2008 , @entity121 , now 86 , told @entity1 that he believes evidence clearly shows @entity4 was not the only person who fired shots in that assassination			0
" we have proof that the second shooter was behind us and off to our right			0
@entity4 was off to the left and in front of us , " @entity121 told @entity1 anchor @entity290			0
watch interview with @entity121 @entity121 declined to comment to @entity1 this week about wednesday 's scheduled parole hearing for @entity4			1
in a 2006 interview on @entity1 's @entity296 , @entity15 recounted how @entity5 and he were shot			0
" well , i was right behind @entity297			0
we were following him to go downstairs and speak to another group of people			0
and i was going with our cameraman down to show him where to plug in			0
and so we followed @entity297 , and the shooting started , " @entity15 said			0
he said after @entity5 was struck three times , he was shot once in the stomach			0
@entity31 , the deputy district attorney , said @entity4 was n't present at his last two parole hearings , in 2003 and 2006 , which @entity31 attended			1
@entity101 said he was chairman of @entity5 's citizens campaign in @entity309 , @entity104 , during his successful 1964 bid for the @entity311 , and @entity101 's duties included taking @entity5 's sisters and mother to political events			0
he said he was also a volunteer in the successful 1960 presidential campaign of @entity5 's brother , @entity140			0
in 1999 , @entity101 represented the rev. @entity318 's family in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning @entity318 's april 4 , 1968 , murder and successfully persuaded a @entity322 , jury to find @entity323 responsible as an accomplice in the @entity318 assassination			0
if @entity4 is denied parole , @entity101 said he would consider appealing the matter to the courts			1
@entity4 was initially sentenced to death , but three years later that sentence was commuted by @entity8 courts to life imprisonment plus six months to 14 years in prison , to run concurrently .			1

one of the surviving shooting victims will not oppose parole if the board oks it
two psychologists ' reports say @entity4 poses no threat to society , his attorney says
