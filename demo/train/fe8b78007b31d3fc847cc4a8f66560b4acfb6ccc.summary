monday is the deadline tor residents of most states to sign up for @entity4 if they want coverage starting january 1			1
and that 's a big deal -- for two reasons : most @entity8 will be required to have some kind of health insurance in 2014 or face a fine			1
there 's also a lot riding on this politically			2
monday will be a key test of president @entity16 's attempt to overhaul the country 's health insurance system			1
here 's what you need to know about the @entity4 coverage and monday 's deadline			1
1 ) i 'm confused			2
have n't the enrollment deadlines moved around ? there 's been a lot of confusion about the deadlines , and for good reason			2
federal and state governments , as well as insurers , keep changing the dates , mainly to accommodate those blocked from completing enrollment due to technical problems			1
each consumer faces two deadlines : one by which to choose a plan , and another for making a payment			0
if you live in one of the 36 states serviced by the federal enrollment website , @entity46 , your best bet for getting hassle - free coverage in 2014 is to select a policy by end of the day monday and pay your first month 's premium by january 10			1
2 ) do i have to have coverage beginning january 1 ? not really			0
the deadline to enroll in coverage to avoid a fine is march 31			1
that 's the date that the program 's open enrollment period officially ends			0
it wo n't reopen until october 15			0
3 ) so why should i worry about the january 1 date ? if you 're without health coverage now , or your plan ends december 31 , you may want to get covered as soon as possible			2
you want to leave enough time for insurance companies to process your application			2
and given all the shifting dates , @entity69 secretary @entity67 says consumers will have to be extra diligent			0
" we advise consumers to call their insurance company to make sure that their payment has been received and that they are indeed enrolled , " she said in mid-december			2
4 ) are the technical problems that plagued the site fixed ? the @entity46 enrollment website got off to a chaotic start , with many users unable to enroll for days due to technical problems			1
" we screwed it up , " @entity16 conceded friday			1
but the @entity16 administration said the issues should be resolved			1
@entity8 are enrolling on @entity46 at a pace of around 25,000 per day so far in december			1
and with few major website outages , it appears the website 's worst technical problems may be in the past			1
5 ) will @entity46 be able to handle a wave of new customers monday ? @entity46 was down for several hours before the president 's remarks			1
so it remains to be seen if a last - minute surge in enrollments will have an impact			0
federal officials recently said that anyone who tries to sign up but encounters a problem with the website can qualify for a special enrollment period and gain coverage as soon as possible			2
6 ) who does n't have to get health insurance ? some @entity8 , such as those who ca n't afford it , will be exempt from the health insurance mandate , according to the @entity108			1
for example , people who make so little they do n't have to file a tax return are exempt			0
people who are in this country without authorization are exempted , as are members of a federally recognized @entity116 who are eligible for services through an @entity116 health care provider			2
people with certain religious beliefs that conflict with acceptance of the benefits of private or public insurance are also exempt			2
7 ) are the rules different in state - based exchanges ? if you are applying in one of the 14 states running its own exchange , you may have a different set of deadlines			0
@entity135 , for example , have until december 31 to pick a plan with coverage starting the next day			0
but they have to pay their first premium by january 6 and wo n't receive an id card until they do			0
in @entity144 , residents who try to apply by monday but run into problems have until january 15 to pick and pay for a plan			0
coverage will be retroactive to january 1			0
@entity147 is giving residents until january 6 to pay , and @entity148 until january 10			0
in other words , if you 're looking at a state - based exchange , it 's best to check with the exchange directly			0
8 ) are state - based exchanges seeing a similar surge ? enrollments there have been mixed			0
covered @entity147 , one of the country 's largest exchanges , has seen the highest numbers by far , with more than 100,000 people enrolled in private plans as of november 30			0
at his friday news conference , @entity16 pointed to the state as a success story			1
yet in neighboring @entity167 , the enrollment total at the end of november was just 44 people -- despite aggressive ad campaigns			0
while some states are reporting increased interest in advance of monday 's enrollment deadline , the full effects of the increase wo n't be understood until after january 1			0
9 ) what will @entity144 be looking at ? the more people enroll , the easier it will be to help @entity181 keep seats in 2014			2
and , of course , a booming enrollment would also improve @entity16 's legacy overall			1
10 ) what do @entity8 think about @entity4 now ? support for the @entity4 has dropped to a record low , according to a new @entity191 / @entity190 poll released monday			1
only 35 % of those questioned said they support @entity4 -- a 5 - point drop in less than a month			1
and 62 % percent say they oppose the law , up 4 points from november			0
the poll also suggests most @entity8 predict the health care law will actually result in higher prices for their own medical care			1
but while 43 % said they oppose @entity4 because it is too liberal , another 15 % said they oppose the law because it is not liberal enough			1
11 ) when will we know whether the enrollment campaign has been a success ? we wo n't know how many people enrolled in december until @entity69 releases its enrollment report sometime in mid-january			0
at that point , the numbers will reflect three full months of enrollment -- the midpoint of the open enrollment period .			0

@entity191 / @entity190 poll : support for @entity4 has dropped to a record low
most @entity8 must have some kind of health insurance in 2014 or will face a fine
" we screwed it up , " @entity16 says of the @entity46 website *launch*
the @entity16 administration says most of the technical issues should have been resolved
