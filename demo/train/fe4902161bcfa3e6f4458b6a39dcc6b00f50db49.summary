-- it 's one of the most individual sports , yet it sometimes demands that fierce rivals unify to compete against other countries in what could be called the @entity7 of tennis			0
a @entity10 final already steeped in intrigue soared to another level saturday and now the question is : can @entity14 and @entity15 recover against @entity16 in front of a potential record crowd this weekend ? @entity14 's back -- the area of his body that has intermittently hindered the 17 - time grand slam champion in a mostly healthy career -- is only part of the issue			1
his relationship with teammate @entity27 in the wake of ' @entity29 ' is worth monitoring , too			1
it 's certainly not the build - up the 33 - year - old @entity14 wanted as he seeks one of the two biggest titles to elude him , the other being an @entity36 singles gold			1
@entity14 's wife , @entity38 , might have taunted @entity27 during her husband 's dramatic 4 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 6 ) win at the @entity40 in @entity41 and it reportedly led to a verbal bust up between the men who captured doubles gold together at the @entity46			1
@entity14 then handed only the third walkover of his career to an opponent , the back not healthy enough to take on world no. 1 @entity52			1
at least on the relationship front , though , things appear to be better between @entity14 and @entity27 ahead of the affair at the @entity57 @entity56 , the home of @entity59 in football 's @entity60			1
@entity14 posted a picture on @entity63 of a united looking @entity15 side and members of the squad said tuesday in @entity59 that any tension was gone			1
" we had a conversation after the match , " @entity14 told reporters			1
" everything 's totally relaxed about the situation			0
" there 's no hard feelings whatsoever			0
we 're having a good time here			0
we are friends , not enemies			0
but obviously it was maybe one of those moments , heat - of - the - moment situations			0
" @entity27 blamed the press for blowing things out of proportion			2
" for us it 's nothing , " he told reporters			0
" it took us five minutes to talk about it , to think about the next main goal that we have -- the @entity10 this weekend			1
" heading into the semifinal at the @entity91 , the @entity15 appeared to have the upper hand in the @entity10 final			1
@entity14 maintained his excellent 2014 form , while @entity27 -- the @entity95 champion -- arrested a slump by winning two matches and extended his compatriot to three tight sets			1
he even had four match points			0
the eventful saturday changed the complexion of the series			0
making the transition from one surface to another is difficult -- the home team chose clay for the @entity10 final and has practiced on it for weeks -- although at least a long flight was n't needed for the @entity15 to get to northern @entity16			1
@entity27 actually took the train from @entity41			2
but @entity14 's back is of greater concern			1
his spot was confirmed in the draw thursday -- he will face @entity115 on friday after @entity27 battles @entity116 -- but being at 100 percent seems unlikely			2
the majority of the at least 27,000 expected to be in attendance per day -- the largest tennis crowd for a professional match remains the 27,200 who turned up to watch @entity122 defeat the @entity123 in the 2004 final in @entity125 -- probably would n't mind if @entity14 is sub-par since it would give @entity16 a massive advantage			1
@entity14 practiced on the clay for the first time wednesday			2
" i 'm just really pleased that i 'm actually able to play tomorrow , " @entity14 said at the draw thursday			2
" i 'll give it a go			0
definitely looking forward to playing against @entity115			0
" things have been going very well for me the last week			0
it 's been a difficult week , but i 'm happy where i am today			0
" @entity14 declined to reveal whether he had taken a cortisone injection for his back			1
all the turmoil in the @entity15 camp does n't mean tennis loving @entity16 -- desperate to end a 13 - year drought in the competition -- can relax , according to @entity16 no. 1 tsonga			1
" i think for this weekend , the important thing for us is to stay focused on ourselves , on our team , " @entity116 told reporters			2
" what we need is to have a perfect performance			0
" what we can do is just play tennis			0
anything else is not really our business			0
" @entity14 and @entity27 were sure things to play singles for @entity15 if deemed fit , with @entity16 holding more options			1
@entity16 captain @entity156 did n't pull off a major surprise , however , when he named @entity115 as the no. 2			2
@entity115 habitually shines at home , spurred on by the crowd and raising his level			0
one of his two victories over @entity14 came at the @entity163 and he held two match points against @entity14 at the @entity165 in september			2
@entity14 , however , has topped @entity115 three times on the clay of @entity168			2
@entity14 was omitted from saturday 's doubles , as was @entity27 , though changes can be made on the day			1
if @entity16 falters early , the large crowd may not be beneficial			0
the @entity16 have been known to boo their own at @entity168 , for example			0
" this is a competition that you want to win , " former @entity16 no. 4 @entity173 , @entity174 's co-coach who played in three finals , told @entity0			1
" you play for your country and you play for your friends but you try to focus on yourself , on your game -- a simple plan			0

@entity16 hosts @entity15 in one of the most anticipated @entity10 finals in decades
@entity14 is bidding for his first @entity10 title this weekend in @entity59
@entity14 's back is a question mark and so is his relationship with teammate @entity27
the @entity16 are desperate to win the @entity10 to end a 13 - year drought in the team event
