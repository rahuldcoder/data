-- november 9 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 : we are students at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity15 and we are flying you in to @entity0 ! @entity20 , @entity21 : thank you to mr. @entity23 's class for that exemplary introduction ! my name is @entity27 , and today 's top stories are right now ! first up : president @entity29 in @entity4 @entity30 : an interesting headline came out of president @entity29 's third day in @entity4 : he was giving a speech to @entity4 's parliament , its government , and the @entity37 president officially endorsed @entity4 getting a permanent seat on the @entity40 @entity39			1
okay , so what ? well , since 1945 , the @entity39 has had five permanent members			1
they include the @entity37 , the @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46			2
these five countries have had the ultimate power to veto any major move that the @entity40 wants to make , so a permanent seat there is very powerful			2
@entity0 's @entity52 explains why president @entity29 wants @entity4 , to have one : @entity52 , @entity54 : why did president @entity29 bring it up ? well , the @entity37 sees a huge potential upside to a powerful @entity4 in terms of democracy			1
president @entity29 sees @entity4 's system as a model for developing countries			1
and then there 's the economy			1
@entity4 is booming , creating more and richer consumers every year			1
and , finally , there 's the issue of security			1
@entity4 is involved in @entity70 , is joining the cause for nuclear nonproliferation			1
as for @entity75 , @entity37 's ties with that country do complicate its ties with @entity4 because those two are arch rivals			1
but that , too , was part of the president 's address			1
@entity30 : besides @entity75 , though , @entity45 also sees @entity4 as a rival and does n't want @entity4 permanently on the @entity39			1
and @entity84 has been trying to get a permanent @entity40 seat since the early 1990s			2
so while the president 's statement was welcomed in @entity4 , action is n't expected anytime soon -- if ever			1
@entity89 @entity30 : no air cargo from @entity91 will be allowed into the @entity37 anytime soon			2
the @entity92 is also saying " no " to any air cargo from the @entity95 country of @entity96			2
and no airline passengers can travel with large printer cartridges			2
these new rules are in effect immediately , and here is the reason : an apparent terrorist plot involving two package bombs			2
they were discovered in late october on air cargo shipments from @entity91 to the @entity37 is this legit ? @entity0 student news : is this legit ? the disease cholera is caused by a virus			1
this is false ; cholera is caused by a bacterial infection			1
unhealthy living conditions @entity30 : that means that cholera can be treated with antibiotics if needed			1
and in most cases , it is an easily curable disease : the @entity119 says proper treatment can keep the number of people who die from cholera to less than one percent			1
the problem in @entity5 is , there 's not a lot of proper treatment			1
@entity128 can spread where drinking water and conditions are generally dirty			2
that 's exactly what @entity133 saw in @entity5 's capital			1
( begin video ) @entity137 , @entity0 correspondent : there is no delicate way to put this , @entity138 looks and smells like a dump , because it is			2
ten months after the earthquake , the city has degenerated into a filthy cauldron of water , garbage and human waste			2
the garbage situation has always been a problem here , but now no one pays any attention to where they dump it and the government makes virtually no effort to pick it up			2
do n't you think that @entity5 deserve better than this ? unidentified @entity161 : we get used to it			1
everybody who grew up in this country are used to it			2
@entity167 : but the stakes are higher now			2
as cholera stalks the city , these are the conditions that so worry health experts			1
just look , @entity5 desperate for water , collect it from a pipe right next to a burning collection of waste			1
the city is like an open garbage pit , this is a central canal that cuts right through the middle of the city and garbage of all descriptions flows right through it			2
and this is where it ends up , right down the canal and piled up			0
tons of garbage just laying waste here in the canal that no one ever seems capable of collecting			0
with cholera now a reality in @entity5 , this is not just a matter of aesthetics or hygiene , it may soon become a matter of life and death			1
( @entity206 ) drowsy drivers @entity30 : okay , our next story today : you know distracted driving -- texting , eating , makeup -- is a dangerous problem			1
you 're not gon na believe this : in a survey taken by @entity218 , two out of every five drivers -- this is 40 percent we 're talking about -- say they 've fallen asleep while driving ! and in the previous month , more than 25 percent of drivers surveyed said they had trouble keeping their eyes open on the road			0
and this is n't just quick dozing without consequences			0
researchers figure that drowsy driving is a factor in one of every eight crashes that send someone to the hospital			0
the head of the @entity218 says people are just underestimating how tired they are and overestimating how well they can deal with it while driving			1
@entity238 @entity0 student news : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity242 's social studies and science classes at @entity244 in @entity245 , @entity246 ! which of these observances was previously known as @entity249 ? is it : a ) @entity253 , b ) @entity251 , c ) @entity254 , or @entity255 ) @entity256 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity258 established @entity249 in 1921 ; the name was changed to @entity256 in 1954			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! helping @entity263 @entity30 : so while it started as a way to honor those who served in @entity267 , veterans day is now a tribute to everyone who 's served in the military			1
a man and some mammals in @entity273 , are working together to help @entity37 's veterans			1
those who return home with " post traumatic stress disorder " sometimes feel intense anxiety , long after the ordeal of combat			1
meet the ones who are offering helping hands and fins			1
( begin video ) @entity286 , @entity288 veteran : come on , lets go out to the dock			0
who wants to play ? there you go			0
so this is not a bad way to spend the rest of your life ; watching these wonderful animals , learning from them			0
my name is @entity301 and i served in @entity302			0
when i joined the @entity288 , i was a teenager			0
and um , i was , i went through my training			0
and was sent to @entity302 almost immediately , like the rest of us			0
i make the best friends ever in um , in um @entity302			0
and i 've also seen some of the most horrific things i 've ever seen in my life			0
which , unfortunately , still stick with me			0
after coming back from @entity302 as a young @entity288 , i was very confused , very angry			0
probably just like all of us out of war			0
and these animals helped me			0
they actually saved my life , if you want to say			0
they 're just a wonderful way , their happiness , the way they look at you , the way they treat you			0
uh , and it carries through			0
and i actually used that with other humans , and guess what ? it works ! i 'm @entity301 , nice to meet you			0
we figured that maybe this would be a good way to help these veterans			1
ready @entity288 ? that a girl , there she comes , she 's sizing you up			1
now there you go , now look this way , big smile			0
do you feel the vibration ? we developed the program to help the men and women who are coming back from @entity70 and @entity343			0
these are heroes and these people deserve our accolades , deserve our applause			0
for that one half hour of time they probably would have forgotten all those things that they have gone through in their war			0
can you kiss @entity353 goodbye , please ? they have that ability to put you in a world where you 're accepted			0
to put you in a world where it 's a good world and not , you 're not thinking about those things , those traumatic things that you 've experienced in the past			2
( @entity206 ) @entity362 @entity30 : we want you to be part of our @entity256 show this thursday ; we 're looking for your comments ! talk to us on our blog or our @entity367 page about the best way you can think of to honor @entity37 's veterans			1
the blog is live at @entity372 ; you 'll find our official @entity367 page at @entity367 / @entity374			0
before we go @entity30 : all right , i know we 're a little early in the year for this , but the " @entity378 " lyric is supposed to be " 12 drummers drumming			0
" this is six hundred ! or somewhere close to it			0
you 've heard of " @entity383 " ; welcome to @entity384 ! a plethora of percussionists playing , pounding , and putting paradiddles to work in an effort to raise money to help schools and to benefit sick children			0
every imaginable instrument of percussion was there , including a $ 35,000 gong			0
goodbye @entity30 : that definitely snared some attention			0
but the event ca n't be beat , as a fine cymbal of helping people out			2
stick around tomorrow for more @entity0 !			0
