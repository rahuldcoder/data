" we are not against the concept of anyone running as long as he has the right legal status , but it 's unacceptable to have one of the symbols of @entity10 's regime run for president , " @entity11 told @entity2			1
" the majority of @entity0 will not accept him			1
his candidacy is an insult to the revolution			0
" the only way @entity9 could win would be by forgery , @entity11 said			1
" if there is a 1 % chance of forgery in the elections , and he wins that way , then all the @entity0 -- not just the @entity4 -- will take to the streets			1
" elections are scheduled to start may 23			1
@entity34 said the brotherhood 's political arm , the @entity37 , would respect " all signed treaties , " including the 1978 @entity39 with @entity40			1
" regardless of any opinion toward these treaties , they were accepted by decent entities in the country , and it does not mean that changing the political system will affect the treaties			0
" but he noted that the accords included a component " about respecting the rights of @entity50			0
the @entity0 respected their part of the deal but the @entity40 -- until now -- have not respected the @entity50 rights			1
the @entity0 complied , but the @entity40 did not			1
" @entity34 said the timing of a loan from the @entity56 to the @entity0 government could prove problematic			1
" the timing is the problem because we do n't think this interim government is performing well , so we object that they take this loan and spend it in two months , then the new government worries about paying it back			0
" whatever happens in the election , the top priority for the @entity4 and the @entity37 is to ease sectarian tensions , which built under @entity10 's regime , he said			1
" @entity10 's former regime really oppressed the @entity71 and the @entity72 because his system was based on tyranny			2
we aim to rebuild our nation again			0
" @entity9 entered the race just hours before the sunday deadline , said @entity78 , who heads the election committee			1
@entity9 had initially said he would not seek the presidency in the first election for the post since the revolution that led to the toppling of @entity10			2

@entity95 , which is 70 % @entity96 , passed a bill against @entity9 's running			1
but it is only symbolic , said @entity100 , the former head of the lawyer 's association			2
" only a decision from the administrative court would execute such a ban , " he told @entity2			0
" banning former regime members from practicing their political rights for five years or even 10 has been discussed thoroughly , but the law has not been reactivated and there must be proof that @entity9 has been implicated in political corruption before he is banned from running			2
" the status of another candidate was less certain			0
a court ruled that liberal opposition leader @entity117 will not be allowed to compete because he was jailed in recent years , the candidate 's son said saturday			2

" we are protecting the revolution and all of its goals			0
... we have decided as the @entity4 and its party to nominate @entity133 as our backup candidate for president , " it said in a statement			0
the group had pledged repeatedly that it would not field a presidential candidate			0
but candidates from its political arm won the largest share of seats in @entity0 's parliamentary elections in december			1
and @entity4 leader @entity150 has said the new @entity0 " is under a serious threat " because its current military - led government " has failed to represent the will of the people			2
" a military junta took power after @entity10 's ouster			0
