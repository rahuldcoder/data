-- earlier this month , a video of young men doing the " @entity7 " -- bare chests and thrusting pelvises -- in front of the @entity3 's headquarters in @entity4 attracted worldwide attention , for putting one finger up to the moral authority of @entity14 conservatives now struggling to govern @entity15			1
but over in @entity16 , a soft - spoken teenage girl offered a far more unsettling challenge to the powers that be			0
@entity20 , a young karate enthusiast , was refused a place in her school 's tournament photo because , she claimed , she does not cover her hair with a hijab			2
her teacher denied such charges of discrimination			0
@entity20 , however was unwilling to take this lying down			0
instead , she took to @entity31 , in a video in which she tearfully lambasted authorities for willful blindness and narrow - mindedness			0
did they not know , she asked , that most of the girls put on the hijab at school but took it off once they left the premises ? and she criticized teachers ' interpretation of @entity14 , for insisting that the hijab was religiously mandated and that those who did not wear it were less worthy than those who covered			0
" we should have equal rights as stressed by the @entity51 , " she told the camera			0

at the @entity63 , governments and @entity61 from around the world have been negotiating a document on the elimination of violence against women , under the umbrella of the @entity69			1
the final text , hammered out after weeks of hard negotiation , reiterates the rights of women to lead their lives free of violence , coercion and discrimination			2
the mere discussion of such issues was , however , enough to send @entity15 's @entity3 into a frenzy			1
" it eliminates @entity14 morals , and seeks the destruction of family institution , " the @entity3 warned in an apocalyptic official statement			0
" then society dissolution will occur , and last steps of cultural invasion will be complete			2
" in urging other muslim - majority country governments to reject the document , the @entity3 attacked it for undermining what they consider a man 's @entity93 - given right to control women ( through various means , including marital rape , it seems , according to their communique ) , further alleging that it promotes homosexuality , adultery , abortion and free love			2
read more : @entity15 blogger -- why i posed naked this hysterical response to any attempt to promote gender , sexual and reproductive rights , at the @entity63 and on the ground in the @entity54 world , is nothing new ; the @entity115 regime was just as intransigent on many of these points			1
and i 've come across it time and again in the past five years i 've spent traveling across the @entity54 region , talking to men and women about sex : what they do , what they do n't , what they think and why			1
sexuality might seem a strange focus in these tumultuous political times			2
it is , in fact , a powerful lens with which to study a society because it offers a view , not just into intimate life , but also of the bigger picture : politics and economics , religion and tradition , gender and generations that shape sexual attitudes and behaviors			1
if you really want to know a people , start by looking inside their bedrooms			0
in today 's @entity54 world , the only socially - accepted context for sex is heterosexual , family - sanctioned , religiously - approved , state - registered marriage — a social citadel			1
anything else is " forbidden " , or " shameful " or " impolite			0
" the fact that large segments of the population in most countries are having hard time fitting inside the fortress -- especially the legions of young people , who ca n't find jobs and therefore ca n't afford to marry -- is widely recognized , but there is also widespread resistance to any alternative			0
the upshot of this refusal to grapple with the changing realities of sexual and personal life in the @entity54 world can be seen in statistics : spiraling rates of @entity176 and other sexually - transmitted infections , a rising tide of sexual violence , on the street and in the home , and the thriving business of clandestine abortion			1
and i 've heard it in the stories of desperate housewives , dissatisfied husbands , conflicted youth , hard - pressed sex workers and many others whom i 've met along the way for all our constraints , the @entity54 world is neither hopeless , nor helpless , when it comes to sex			1
there are innovators from across the region who are trying to tackle the taboos , break the silence and deal with the fall out , be it getting sexuality education in schools or providing sexual and reproductive health services for young people , or tackling sexual violence , or trying to find space in society for those cross social norms , unwed mothers or men and women in same - sex relations among them			1
nor are these projects simply carbon copies of efforts elsewhere in the world ; the reason they are taking root is because they are adapted to the region , and work along the grain of religion and culture			2

too often , they say to tackle such matters is " un-islamic " and a sell - out to the @entity233			0
but this is simply not the case			0
@entity54 and @entity14 culture has a long history of talking about sex , in its all its problems and pleasures , for men and women -- and that includes @entity244 himself			1
there is precious little in " @entity247 , " " @entity248 , " " the @entity249 , " or any other taboo - busting work of the sexual revo ¬ lution and beyond that @entity254 literature -- much of it written by @entity14 scholars -- did n't touch on over a mil ¬ lennium ago			0
on a wide variety of gender and sexual issues -- be it contraception or abortion or even the incendiary topic of homosexuality -- there are alternative interpretations in @entity14			0
it 's not just @entity54 human rights activists at the @entity63 who have been making this point in recent days ; @entity15 's teenage karate dissident argues much the same			1
those who seek to control society through religion -- in any culture -- discourage such independent thinking and diversity of opinion			2
but with the new climate of freedom of expression emerging in @entity15 , and elsewhere in the @entity54 region , millions now feel emboldened to challenge these dictates			1
politics , religion and sex are the three " red lines " of the @entity54 world : subjects you 're not supposed to tackle in word or deed			1
but just as people in countries across the region are busy contesting received wisdoms in politics , and are starting to challenge the role of religion in public policy , i hope they will start asking the same hard questions of sexual life			2
read more : do n't lose hope over @entity304 the " slippery slope " logic reflected in the @entity3 's statement remains all too common in across the region			0
it 's the fear that any move toward greater personal freedom -- especially sexual freedom -- will lead to a free - for - all and a violation of @entity14 principles			0
but this reflects a fundamental lack of trust in the citizenry , which is a feature of dictatorship , not the hallmark of democracy			0
if @entity15 's @entity3 wants to walk the talk of freedom and justice , dignity and equality , that means giving people information and resources and trusting them to use it responsibly -- in and out of the bedroom			1
achieving these goals in personal life is important to realizing them in public life , and vice versa : the political and sexual are natural bedfellows			0

@entity15 's government protested against a @entity63 document on violence against women
@entity352 says @entity4 's " hysterical " reaction was nothing new
politics , religion and sex are the @entity54 world 's " three red lines , " she says
@entity352 says sexuality is a powerful lens through which to study a society
