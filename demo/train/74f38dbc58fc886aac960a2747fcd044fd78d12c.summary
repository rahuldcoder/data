you -- the person now reading this story -- can help experts solve the mystery of what happened to @entity6 , which disappeared over the open sea			0
in fact , thousands of aspiring good samaritans are volunteering their time to scour part of the plane 's search zone using detailed satellite images posted online by @entity15 , a @entity16 firm that owns one of the world 's most advanced commercial satellite networks			1
so many volunteers have joined the effort that the firm 's website -- with its pinpoint pictures of everything floating in the ocean -- has crashed			1
it is a busy week for " crowdsourcing , " the @entity28 phenomenon where information is gathered from @entity31 and @entity32 -- people like you -- and from your social media postings			1
" this is a real needle - in - the - haystack problem , except the haystack is in the middle of the ocean , " @entity36 of @entity15 told @entity38 affiliate @entity37			1
" i will ask you to mark anything that looks interesting , any signs of wreckage or life rafts			1
" @entity15 's satellite photos taken 400 miles above the @entity48 can capture a detail as small as a home plate			1
the challenge is finding the manpower to scour 1,235 square miles of such images on one of @entity15 's websites , @entity56 -- with more pictures to be posted this week from satellites above the @entity59 , said @entity60 , an @entity61 publicist retained by @entity15			1
that 's where crowdsourcing comes in			2
timeline of the flight " in many cases , the areas covered are so large , or the things we 're looking for are so hard to find , that without the help of hundreds of thousands of people online , we 'd never be able to find them , " @entity36 said			2
one volunteer , @entity73 , 43 , found a fascinating image in a matter of minutes : the silhouette in the ocean has the scale of a @entity80 777 - 200 , the same model of @entity6			2
his discovery can be seen on his @entity84 page , which is also a form of crowdsourcing used by @entity38			2
" at first , i skipped past it , thinking , ' nah			0
no way i would find anything that quickly , ' " @entity73 told @entity38 on tuesday			0
" but then i kept scrolling back to it and thinking to myself , ' it does resemble a plane ...			2
' " i played with the zoom on my browser a bit , and took a screenshot at 200 % , which is what i uploaded " to @entity84 , said @entity73 , a manager of information technology in the @entity94 area			0
but @entity73 does have his doubts : " looking at it objectively , the shape of ' my ' object appears plane - like and the dimensions are consistent with a 777 - 200			2
that said , i feel it is more likely to be a boat			0
" four scenarios @entity15 and the @entity110 website officials have yet to respond to his flagging of the curious image			0
" their site is getting slammed , apparently , because about half the time that i try to access it , i get an error page , and sometimes even though i log in , no map loads , " @entity73 said tuesday			0
" the site got slammed like healthcare.gov			0
" @entity121 officials were n't available to respond to @entity38 's requests for a comment tuesday			0
in response to the @entity128 plane 's disappearance , @entity15 activated its subscription service to emergency managers , which provides online access to satellite images before and after the incident , the firm said on its website			1
the photos are used for emergency response , damage assessment and recovery			0
the company performed a similar " global crowdsourcing campaign " in november 's @entity140 in the @entity141 , allowing volunteers to tag online more than 60,000 objects of interest from satellite photos			1
the information was forwarded to emergency responders , the firm said			0
the firm also tracked damage last year in the @entity152 , @entity153 , tornado and the @entity16 floods			1
in another case , the satellite imagery also helped locate the remains of two missing hikers in @entity161 , the affiliate reported			1
the firm , based in @entity164 , also uses geospatial big data , which is " information and insight taken from imagery and derived from various sources such as social media , " the firm said			0
the company used the technology in satellite images of the recent @entity175 in @entity176 and cross-referenced the photos with social media data " to analyze overall activity , linguistic composition and mood for people around @entity183 , " the firm said			1
' phantom call ' theory dismissed			0

satellite images from @entity59 will go online for crowdsourcing too
man spots a floating plane in satellite photo , but it could be a boat too , he says
a @entity16 firm asks the public to search for missing plane in satellite photos of ocean
" we *'ll* ask you to mark anything that looks interesting , any signs of wreckage , " rep says
