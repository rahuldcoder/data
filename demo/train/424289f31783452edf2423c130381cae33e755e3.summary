-- locked away deep beneath the sea off @entity3 ' southern shores lays a treasure chest of natural gas that could ease the country 's economic plight			1
still reeling from the infectious banking crisis that exploded at the beginning of 2013 , @entity3 ' government hopes the @entity12 gas field , discovered two years ago , will help lift the country out of the economic doldrums			1
named after the goddess of love , the " @entity16 " gas field could contain up to six trillion feet of cubic gas			1
just 0.5 trillion cubic feet of gas could provide @entity3 with energy for 25 years , leaving ample reserves for export to @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity3 ' energy minister @entity20 told @entity0 in an interview			1
but the minister was quick to stress that offshore gas operations would not solve @entity3 ' economic anguish in the short - term			1
" we do not depend on the offshore operations and the gas to come out of this recession , " said @entity20			0
" in the mid- and short - term we 're looking at side effect benefits			0
" read more : @entity3 country profile @entity20 believes it will take until 2020 before @entity3 sees any direct benefit from the gas			1
" a lot needs to be done			0
the cheap availability of energy is also going to allow us to create other industries such as petrochemicals and heavy manufacturing , " he said the minister added that multinational oil and gas companies as well as infrastructure projects aimed at converting gas to liquid would create jobs , spur growth and boost exports			1
a long term project @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity65 - based @entity64 have all secured contracts to operate in the @entity12 field with extensive exploration and drilling set to begin in october 2014 , lasting for 12 months , according to the energy ministry			1
however , the 150 - kilometer distance between the gas field and @entity3 ' shores could delay operations			1
" because of the distance offshore , the field would require a pipeline to reach the mainland of @entity3 at which point it could be used for domestic economy or lng ( @entity83 ) export , " said @entity75 , senior vice president of @entity76 of @entity64			2
the government says it is planning to finalize investment and build an onshore lng plant while using @entity3 ' proximity to the @entity88 and its ties with @entity26 to exploit export opportunities in @entity25 and @entity26 respectively			0
but @entity91 , ceo of @entity92 and former @entity94 consultant , said that @entity3 " can not economically justify even one lng plant " based on current reserves			2
he added that @entity3 could possibly build a plant if the country reached an agreement to liquefy excess @entity101 gas from the country 's @entity103 and @entity104 fields , which are significantly bigger than @entity3 ' @entity12 field			1
" @entity3 itself is a small market that does not justify the financing efforts , " @entity91 said			0
" one lng plant incurs $ 6 billion in construction costs			0
the development cost of a major offshore gas field could reach $ 4 billion ( while ) exporting natural gas via ships in liquid form is a very expensive and time consuming process			0
" according to @entity119 , @entity3 residents are subject to the highest electricity bills in the @entity121 because the country produces power by burning oil			2
but by switching to gas and converting its power stations @entity3 could alleviate some of the financial burden on consumers			2
" the @entity3 people need to much more patient			0
it takes a lot of time to discover and develop oil and gas fields			0
in the @entity135 and the @entity136 for example it took 10 to 20 years , " said @entity91			0
a brighter future the discovery of gas and the inward investment from global energy companies is a silver lining for @entity3 at time of pervasive economic gloom			1
in march , a banking crisis shattered the country 's economy ; destroyed @entity3 ' second largest bank and threatened the life savings of thousands of residents			2

@entity159 , senior economist at @entity161 - based consultancy @entity160 , said the benefits of gas reserves could help @entity3 service its debt : " in the medium term , license fees for exploration and development could be helpful in closing the financing gap			1
down the road , royalties and job creation could be a major plus			0
" with gas sources in the @entity136 expected to decline over the next decade and few countries willing to invest in nuclear energy in the wake of the @entity180 disaster in @entity181 , @entity3 could also provide the answer to @entity26 's energy demands as it seeks to decrease its dependency on @entity186 gas			1
" a pipeline between @entity101 and @entity3 to @entity26 via @entity188 and @entity189 would cost $ 6 billion to $ 8 billion ... i think it is very important to conduct a feasibility study to see if this is economically viable , " said @entity91			2
in the meantime , @entity3 struggling under the weight of a recession are hoping the government 's predictions are correct and that gas could ultimately provide the basis for ending the economic crisis			0
@entity0 's @entity202 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity3 gas reserves in the offshore @entity12 are *estimated* to be between *3.6* and 6 trillion cubic feet .
@entity3 ' energy minister said the just a *fraction* of the gas reserves could serve the country for up to 25 years .
the energy minister believes it will take until the end of the decade before @entity3 sees any direct benefit from the gas .
