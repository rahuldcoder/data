on the campaign trail , @entity0 vowed to rule his country with an iron fist			1
the retired general said he would send troops into the streets to fight drug violence			2
analysts summed up his political platform with three words : law and order			0
now -- just two months after taking office -- the 61 - year - old @entity15 president is pushing a controversial proposal that has come under fire from @entity19 officials and earned praise from people who were once his critics			1
during a routine speech last month , @entity0 slipped in a surprise announcement			2
last year 's law - and - order candidate said he wanted to legalize drugs			2
" what i have done is put the issue back on the table , " @entity0 told @entity26 en @entity27			2
" i think it is important for us to have other alternatives			0
... we have to talk about decriminalization of the production , the transit and , of course , the consumption			0
" the proposal caught many @entity15 off guard			1
" everyone was expecting him to copy the strategy of ( @entity49 president ) @entity50 and involve the military in fighting cartels , " said @entity41 , director of @entity42 , an investigative journalism and analysis website in @entity15			1
" then he made this surprise announcement ... without even his foreign minister knowing about it			0
" the president 's unexpected pitch grabbed global headlines -- and the attention of international leaders			2
@entity62 presidents are scheduled to debate the idea in @entity15 on saturday			1
the meeting could pave the way for a significant policy shift in a region where brutal drug violence is a daily reality			0
' too high a human cost ' the attackers left a warning written in blood on a white wall at a northern @entity15 farm : " i will find you and i will leave you like this			2
" nearby , investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers			0
authorities said members of the @entity85 drug gang were behind the massacre last may in the province of @entity88			0
officials and analysts pointed to the slayings as more evidence of a devastating spike in drug - related violence across the region			2
at a conference on regional security last year , @entity15 's then - president , @entity96 , said his country was reaching the limit of its ability to fight cartels			1
" eight killed per ton ( of cocaine ) passing through @entity15 is a lot of blood			0
if you pass through @entity109 , there are 20 murders , and if we add it up , a ton of cocaine has too high a human cost , " he said			0
@entity15 's murder rate is 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world , according to a @entity121 report			1
" the immense economic power of drug trafficking has corrupted all the spheres of the state			0
the violence is incredibly high , " said @entity126 , a well - known @entity15 lawyer and radio show host			0
@entity0 is n't the first leader to propose that legalizing drugs may help stem the bloodshed			1
in a 2009 report , three former @entity133 presidents -- @entity136 's @entity135 , @entity138 's @entity137 , and @entity49 's @entity139 -- called for decriminalizing cannabis for personal use			1
former @entity49 president @entity142 also has said he supports legalizing marijuana use			0
but analysts say sitting presidents rarely make such proposals , fearing political consequences			0
" this has been an academic debate and it has also been a scientific debate , an issue that has been studied			0
and bringing it back into political debate , i think , is important , " @entity0 told @entity151 last month			1
a political strategy ? @entity19 officials responded swiftly to @entity0 's proposal			1
" the @entity19 continues to oppose such measures because evidence shows that our shared drug problem is a major public health and safety threat , " the @entity19 @entity157 in @entity15 said in a statement a day after @entity0 first floated his proposal			1
the embassy urged @entity15 and other countries in the region to continue fighting drug traffickers			1
" with increased cultivation and consumption of decriminalized drugs , crime in @entity62 could well increase as the drug cartels shift their focus to other forms of illicit activities , " the statement warned			1
weeks later , on a trip to @entity49 and @entity109 , @entity19 vice president @entity178 said he was open to debating the issue			1
but he stressed that the @entity19 would not waver from its policy against drug legalization			1
" if ( @entity0 's ) strategy is a political strategy designed to get @entity190 's attention , then it worked , " said @entity183 , managing director of @entity184 , an online information network focused on @entity133			2
some skeptics have suggested @entity0 may be bluffing -- using the legalization debate to pressure @entity19 officials into bringing back military aid to @entity15			1
such aid has been cut off for decades due to human rights abuses committed during the @entity62 nation 's civil war			2
@entity15 defense minister @entity198 told @entity151 thursday that he was meeting with officials in @entity190 to discuss lifting the military aid embargo			1
" it 's a question of a political decision , " he said			0
" at any moment this restriction could be lifted and help us become more efficient partners in meeting our responsibility to help with security for the region and therefore the continent			0
" @entity211 , who directed the @entity212 from 2001 to 2009 , said decriminalization is " utterly self - defeating " and would cause more crime			0
he described @entity0 's proposal as " a call for help and a call for @entity19 leadership			1
" " they 're telling us , ' we think we have to give up , because we do n't think we can win , " @entity211 said			0
details unclear as debate nears supporters of @entity0 say @entity133 nations should create new drug policies that do n't follow in @entity19 footsteps			1
the @entity19 has not done enough to stop the demand for drugs , they argue , and many in @entity133 are suffering the consequences			2
" all we 're doing is , in effect , fighting a @entity19 battle outside of @entity19 borders , " said ambassador @entity232 , a former deputy foreign minister of mexico who advocates drug legalization			1
creating a regulated market and opting for a less militaristic approach should decrease violence , he said			0
" the fundamental problem of the violence ... is directly related to this so - called war on the cartels and this war on drug trafficking and the effort by the criminals to show that they have more money , more weapons , more people , " @entity232 said			0
but could drug legalization efforts in the region work without @entity19 backing ? " even if the @entity19 is not willing at this point to go along , there is space for @entity133 countries to take certain steps , " said @entity254 , a political scientist who specializes in @entity133 and international drugs policy at the @entity256			1
" of course , politically , that will be one of the questions			0
how much pressure will the @entity19 put on @entity133 to prevent this ? " details about the ideas @entity62 leaders will debate saturday have not been released to the public			1
@entity0 plans to present a range of proposals at the meeting , @entity15 's foreign minster said			1
drug legalization is also expected to come up before a wider audience of regional leaders at next month 's @entity278 in @entity279 , @entity138			1
@entity280 , the director of @entity42 , said saturday 's meeting will be a promising start to the debate , even if it takes years to hash out the details			0
" it would n't surprise me if in the next decade there would be a @entity133 agreement to legalize drugs , " he said			0
but some analysts were more doubtful that other countries in the region would follow @entity0 's lead			2
" publicly , i would be very surprised if they stand behind this , " said @entity183 , of @entity184			0
@entity254 said he hoped the leaders would weigh other drug policy changes , in addition to legalization			0
" i fear that this debate could lead into deadlock , " he said			0
" from the current situation , to jump to legalization as an answer to all these problems that are getting worse , i think it 's a recipe for a debate that will get stuck pretty soon			2

former military general @entity0 surprised many when he proposed decriminalizing drugs
@entity62 presidents will debate the @entity15 leader 's proposal this weekend
@entity19 officials respond swiftly , saying they do not support drug legalization
some skeptics say the @entity15 president is bluffing to get money from the @entity19
