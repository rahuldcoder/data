-- a blockbuster movie could not have been scripted better : a woman whose unparalleled voice earned her the kind of single - name recognition that felt like an unbearable burden			1
fitting , then , that superstar @entity8 should eulogize his co-star in this way			1
at @entity12 's funeral saturday , @entity8 recalled a woman who doubted herself when she need not have			1
he revealed how @entity12 was chosen to star with him in the 1992 movie " the bodyguard			1
" few had confidence in @entity12 -- she had never acted before			2
a lot was riding on this role , he said , and the studio was unsure about giving it to a black woman			1
but @entity8 thought she was perfect , though she would have to prove it to the studio with a screen test			1
in her trailer , he took her nervous hands in his ; told her she looked beautiful			2
" i could still feel the doubt , " he said			2
she asked for some time and after 20 minutes appeared for the screen test			2
" we had n't said four lines when we had to stop , " @entity8 recalled			1
" i needed to know what she had done in those 20 minutes			2
" he stood her in front of a mirror , her makeup running down her face			2
in those 20 minutes , she had wiped off the studio makeup and applied her own , the thick heavy kind she wore for her music videos , the kind that melted under the heat of studio lights			2
she did n't think the lighter makeup made her look good enough			2
to @entity8 , @entity12 seemed so small and sad at that moment			1
" you were n't just pretty			0
you were as beautiful as a woman could be , " @entity8 said in front of a packed @entity51 church			1
" @entity12 , if you could hear me now , i would tell you : you were n't just good enough			0
you sang the whole damn song without a band			0
" @entity8 , of course , was referring to @entity12 's signature song : " @entity58 " from " the bodyguard			1
" " a lot of leading men could have played my part , but you , @entity12 , i truly believe , you were the only one who could have played @entity64			0
" for her closest friends inside that church saturday , and strangers who continue to draw inspiration from her voice , @entity8 's words hit a painfully honest note about human frailty			1
" it was the burden that made her great and the part that caused her to stumble again , " he said			0
years after " @entity82 " hit theaters , reports of @entity12 's struggles with drug addiction and a rocky marriage with @entity81 surfaced and her album sales declined			0
" the inexplicable burden that comes with fame , " @entity8 said			1
i know the famous in the room have had theirs			0
" @entity8 said @entity12 's own story could help a new generation of young girls who dream big			1
" maybe they 're thinking they are n't good enough , " he said			0
" i think @entity12 would tell you : guard your bodies			0
guard the precious miracle of your life			0
then sing your hearts out , knowing that there 's a lady in heaven who 's making @entity109 himself wonder how he created something so perfect			0
" so off you go , @entity12			0
off you go , " @entity8 said in closing			1
" escorted by an army of angels to your heavenly father			0
and when you sing before him , do n't you worry			0
you 'll be good enough			0
