-- add one more uncertainty to the many questions that surround the @entity4 murder verdict : will she wind up back in a cell in @entity7 ? " i will never go willingly back , " she told @entity9 's " @entity8 " on friday			1
" i 'm going to fight this until the very end , and it 's not right and it 's not fair and i 'm going to do everything i can			0
" @entity15 , who is @entity16 and living in the @entity16 , said she watched the guilty verdict handed down thursday by an @entity7 appeals court over the @entity19 , translating what was happening to family members who were with her			1
" this really has hit me like a train			0
i did not expect this to happen			2
" " i really expected so much better from the @entity7 justice system , " she added			1
" they found me innocent before , how can they say it 's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt ? " @entity15 , 26 , said she " got my first cry " en route to the television station			1
" you have to stand up for yourself and you have to believe that it 's going to be ok , " she said			0
her lawyer was equivocal about her possible extradition back to @entity7 , where she already spent four years in prison awaiting and during her first trial			1
" i can understand why that is the question of the day , " @entity42 told @entity0 friday , but he did n't answer it			2
he did note that the next court proceeding is " probably a year away , " and confirmed that he planned to appeal			0
but many other questions must be answered first			0
" it 's not really a question that is an issue today , or tomorrow , or for a long time to come			0
we have to await the motivation that will be generated by the court , we have to see the basis upon which they have rendered their finding			0
from that , there will be an appeal , a minimum of one appeal			0
" so , i understand why you might be posing the question today , but it 's really not right for consideration , and i would n't comment on that at this time			2
" citing privacy and confidentiality concerns , @entity65 spokeswoman @entity64 declined to say whether @entity7 has requested that @entity15 be extradited			1
@entity15 and her former boyfriend , @entity7 @entity68 , were found guilty thursday of the 2007 murder of @entity71 @entity70			1
prosecutors say she was held down and stabbed after she rejected attempts by @entity15 , @entity68 and another man , @entity76 - born @entity70 , to involve her in a sex game			1
@entity78 is the only person still in jail for the murder			0
extradition would be a logical move , @entity84 's brother , @entity83 , told reporters			2
" in as much as , yes , if somebody 's found guilty -- and this would go for anybody -- if somebody 's found guilty and convicted of a murder			0
" he added , " i do n't see why they would n't			2
" the retrial reversed an earlier appeal judgment			0
@entity68 was sentenced to 25 years in prison ; @entity15 , who remained in the @entity16 and did not attend the trial , was sentenced in absentia to 28 - 1/2 years			1
@entity0 legal analyst @entity97 said that @entity15 may be protected by @entity16 law , which dictates that a person can not be tried twice on the same charge			1
" because of this tension between @entity7 and @entity16 law , it is unlikely that @entity16 law will extradite her			1
when the fight begins , those are the grounds that @entity16 attorneys will be arguing			1
" a law professor disagreed			1
" they always forget she was convicted first , " @entity109 , who teaches transnational law at @entity111 in @entity112 , told @entity113			2
if @entity7 does file an extradition request with the @entity65 , @entity15 will have the right to challenge her transfer to @entity7 in a @entity16 court			1
" the chances of her winning that are not high because there has to be some very strong claim she 'd have to make to block her extradition , " @entity109 added			2
" i followed the trial , it was slow but i never got the sense that it was unfair , " he said			0
but legal rules may not necessarily be followed when it comes to the high - profile case , said @entity9 's legal analyst , @entity134			2
" you have to believe that , despite what all the lawyers will tell you , that this will come down to some degree to politics , " he said			0
would the @entity65 approve an extradition request ? " i think , with all of the public support for @entity4 , that is unlikely , " he said			1
@entity0 legal analyst @entity145 said that , if @entity15 does wind up being sent back to @entity7 , it wo n't happen soon			1
" we are very far away from the day when she gets extradited , " he said			0
@entity150 law professor @entity149 said @entity15 's looks and public support may help her			1
" as popular as she is here and as pretty as she is here -- because that 's what this is all about , if she was not an attractive woman , we would n't have the group love - in -- she will be extradited if it 's upheld			2
" the @entity7 legal system , though i do n't love it , is a legitimate legal system and we have a treaty with @entity7 so i do n't see how we would resist , " he told @entity113			1
" we 're trying to get ( fugitive @entity168 leaker @entity167 ) @entity166 back -- how does it look if we want @entity166 back and we wo n't return someone for murder ? " he asked			1
@entity149 told @entity0 last march that , even if @entity15 avoids extradition , " she remains a prisoner in the @entity16 , because @entity173 will put a warrant out for her and , if she travels anywhere outside the @entity16 , she 'll be immediately arrested and turned over to @entity7			1
" the grounds for extraditions can be fuzzy			0
in 1998 , an @entity16 military jet clipped a ski lift cable , sending a gondola carrying 20 passengers to their deaths in the @entity7 @entity184			1
@entity7 prosecutors wanted the crew of the jet tried in @entity7 , but an @entity7 court ruled they should face courts - martial in the @entity16 , in accordance with @entity192 treaties			1
the aircraft 's pilot and navigator were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter , even though the military admitted the plane had been flying lower and faster than authorized			0
when it emerged that a video that captured the accident from inside the plane had been destroyed , the crew members were dismissed from the @entity204			0
@entity7 were outraged , referring to the incident as the " massacre of @entity207			1
" in another incident , @entity209 cleric @entity208 was seized off the streets of @entity212 in 2003 and smuggled to @entity209 , where he says he was tortured and released four years later			0
although @entity7 did not request the extradition of any of the suspects , 22 @entity214 agents were convicted in absentia of the kidnapping and sentenced to prison for their role in the abduction , but none has served time			1
the @entity84 family welcomed thursday 's ruling , which overturns the previous decision to acquit @entity15 and @entity68			2
" they are tired of this and want justice , " @entity227 , the family 's attorney , said			0
the case has dragged on for six years			0
" i think we are still on the journey to the truth , " said @entity84 's sister , @entity233			0
" i think it may be the fact that we do n't ever really know what happened that night , which is obviously something we will have to come to terms with			2
" @entity84 , @entity70 's brother , said the family may have to wait until spring 2015 for a final resolution , since the verdicts reached thursday can still be appealed at @entity7 's @entity245			2
" nothing is going to bring @entity70 back , nothing will take away the horror of what happened for her , " he said			0
" the best we can hope for is finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion , having a conviction , and everyone can move on with their lives			0
" @entity0 's @entity258 contributed to this report .			0
