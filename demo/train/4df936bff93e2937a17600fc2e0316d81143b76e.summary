-- the @entity2 's recent decision to permit the televising of trials in the state 's circuit courts brings to mind another question of television in a court : the @entity10 @entity2			1
the @entity2 will soon hear oral argument -- the fascinating , highly informative back - and - forth between the justices and the lawyers before them -- in a monumental case that will determine the constitutionality of the government 's new health care plan			1
@entity19 has asked the justices for permission to televise the extraordinary five - and - a - half hours of oral argument ( most cases get just one hour ) scheduled for march 26 through 28			1
but the @entity2 , despite numerous requests and even proposed congressional action extending over several decades , has never permitted television			1
the justices fear the presence of cameras would tarnish the court 's dignified proceedings			1
but bear in mind that the @entity2 does n't try cases , so there 's no danger of uncorking sensational trials like those of @entity38 , @entity39 or @entity41 's doctor			1
that 's not the issue			0
chief justice @entity44 told the annual conference of the @entity46 last june that he worries how cameras might affect both lawyers and judges			2
he was asked , " do you worry that judges might ask even more questions ? " " i do , " he replied emphatically			0
he added , a bit defensively : " we are the most transparent branch of government			0
" he also questioned whether televising congressional sessions has enhanced them			1
in fact , there 's lots of experience to point to , and the precedents are clear : television would not impair the @entity2 's dignity or its proceedings			1
two - thirds of the state supreme courts admit cameras to their oral arguments			1
two federal appellate courts have allowed them			2
they 're standard in the @entity71			0
most of these courts have welcomed cameras for years without adverse consequences , effectively dispelling the vague worries of the justices in @entity78			1
the @entity2 , for example , began experimenting with tv cameras as early as 1983 , according to its press secretary , @entity81			1
it now provides its own videos of oral arguments and posts them daily			1
it 's routine and unobtrusive			0
three small , silent cameras mounted in the @entity87 courtroom are operated remotely by state employees in the basement of the court building			2
similarly , @entity92 's highest court , the @entity46 , first authorized tv coverage in 1987 , and since 2009 all oral arguments have been covered and posted in the court 's archive , according to @entity97 , the court 's public information officer			1
coverage is provided by just two small cameras mounted on window sills at the sides of the court room , operated remotely from a studio in the basement			2
" our experience , " @entity97 said , " is that it has not caused any problems			0
the more the public can learn about what leads to a decision , the more willing they are to accept it			0
" when the @entity2 of @entity114 was considering television coverage , one of its justices , @entity118 , undertook his own survey and found that " state supreme courts have blazed a significant technological trail			1
" he wrote , in 2007 , in the @entity122 : " the public 's response , according to those state supreme courts that provide those video broadcasts , borders on the exuberant			2
[ @entity128 ] o state that currently provides video of its oral arguments cites grandstanding as a problem			2
" @entity134 quoted the then chief justice of the @entity136 @entity2 , @entity137 , as telling him that its videos provided " the best @entity139 you can imagine			2
" @entity114 two years ago became the 34th state supreme court to admit cameras			2
judge @entity143 of the @entity144 in @entity145 commented in the @entity122 about his court 's long experience on - camera that both judges and lawyers " have acted with the civility and decorum appropriate to a federal appellate courtroom , by and large resisting the temptation to play to the television audience			0
my own experience with cameras in the courtroom has been overwhelmingly positive			0
" in @entity161 the proceedings of the nation 's @entity2 have been televised since the mid- 1990s			1
four fixed cameras , mounted high on the walls of the courtroom in @entity165 , face the bench and the counsel 's podium			0
when a judge asks a question , she pushes a button that both opens her microphone and focuses a camera on her			0
" our judges are proud of it , " said @entity175 , executive legal officer of the @entity71			0
" there 's no downside			0
it has not been disruptive			0
there 's no playing to the camera			0
" of course , if the @entity10 @entity2 should allow television , but then finds that its presence is deleterious , the justices could always reverse their own decision			2
they 've done it before			0
@entity10 visiting @entity78 stand in line for hours to see the @entity2 in action , but there 's limited space inside the ornate courtroom			2
however , it should be noted that the court has taken recent steps to better inform the public : it publishes transcripts of each oral argument later that same day , and each friday it releases audio recordings of all oral arguments that week			1
still , the justices should welcome television coverage , not only of the coming health care case , but of all their oral arguments			1
even in this digital age of 24/7 access to almost everything , television news still reaches more people			0
a survey reported in january by the @entity212 found that " television remains the most widely used source for national and international news -- 66 % of @entity10 say it is their main source of news			0
" tv coverage would greatly enhance public understanding of the court and its work			0
if the justices decide soon , unobtrusive cameras can be mounted in the courtroom in time for the historic health care oral argument in march			1
then they 'll be available for future cases as well			0
good for the court , good for the country			1

@entity238 : @entity2 should follow other courts , televise its arguments
he says a good start would be to show oral argument on @entity247 health care law
@entity238 : cameras have n't disrupted the proceedings of other courts
televising court sessions would be good for the country and for the court , he says
