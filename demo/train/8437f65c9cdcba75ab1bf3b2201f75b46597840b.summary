-- people are mourning the tragic overdose death of @entity4 - winning actor @entity3 , who was found sunday morning alone in his @entity6 apartment with a needle in his arm and empty bags of heroin			1
when a beloved celebrity such as @entity3 dies of an overdose , it 's front page news			1
but his death serves as a reminder that 105 people are dying in the @entity18 every day from an overdose involving heroin or pharmaceutical opioids			1
with more than 30,000 deaths annually , accidental overdose has overtaken car accidents as our country 's leading cause of accidental death for people 25 to 64			1
the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on the drug war did nothing to prevent a dramatic increase in overdose fatalities ; indeed , those very policies likely increased the number of people who die from an overdose			1
some people are going to use heroin , or play around with pharmaceutical opiates , no matter what we say and no matter what the government does			1
the real challenge is to do what we can to help people stay alive			1
here are seven steps that can help : 1			0
make treatment available to those who want and need it : it is tragic that so many people who need treatment ca n't get it			1
it is outrageous that we taxpayers spend , on average , $ 30,000 a year to incarcerate someone with a drug problem , but we skimp on treatment programs that are less expensive and more effective in reducing illegal drug use and other crime			0
too many people who want treatment are told there are no open slots and turned away			2
@entity3 's ' everyman ' brilliance 2			1
offer methadone and buprenorphine to those with opioid addiction : methadone and buprenorphine have been the gold - standard treatment for opioid addiction for decades			0
these replacement therapies can allow people to live normal lives without the highs and lows of illegal heroin and other opioids			2
we need to remove the obstacles to making these life - saving medications more readily available and end the stigma that discourages people from seeking out the most effective treatment			2
honest drug education : we urge young people to stay clear of alcohol , tobacco and other drugs , but the reality is many will experiment with using substances no matter what			2
we must teach them the risks and consequences of drug use			0
most overdose deaths are a result of mixing opioids and alcohol but most people do n't know that			2
anyone who receives a prescription for a pain medication , knows a person misusing heroin or other opioids or who cares about keeping people alive , needs to know the incredible risks of mixing with alcohol			2
@entity118 laws for 911 callers : most people who overdose do n't die			1
but the chance of surviving an overdose , like that of surviving a heart attack , depends greatly on how fast one receives medical assistance			0
unfortunately people are afraid to call 911 because they do n't know if the police who respond will focus on arresting those present rather than saving someone 's life			1
fourteen states and the @entity133 have passed " 911 @entity118 " laws that encourage people to call for help without fear of arrest			1
although it appears @entity3 was alone when he overdosed , thousands of others are not			2
people need to call for help			2
it should never be a crime to call 911 to help save a life			1
@entity3 dead of apparent overdose 5			1
make naloxone , the antidote to an overdose , more available : @entity150 is a safe , generic , inexpensive , nonnarcotic drug that works quickly and is easy to administer			1
it has saved hundreds of thousands of lives but could be saving many more			0
many states are just starting to take some great steps to get naloxone in the hands of more people , including law enforcement and emergency responders			0
anyone who uses opioids for any reason at all should have naloxone readily available , and friends and family who know how to administer it			0
there 's no really good reason , moreover , why this antidote should only be available by prescription			0
if we really want to save lives , pharmacists should be allowed to sell it to whoever needs it			0
supervised injection facilities : dozens of cities around the world have supervised injection facilities where people can inject their drugs in a clean , safe place with medical professionals on hand			0
these facilities eliminate overdose fatalities , reduce dangerous drug consumption practices as well as @entity190 and hepatitis c , minimize the public nuisance of people using drugs in public places and more than pay for themselves by reducing the need for criminal justice and emergency medical services			2
it has been particularly successful in @entity201			0
the scientific consensus demonstrating the benefits of these facilities has yet to result in one such facility being opened anywhere in the @entity18			2
heroin - assisted treatment : conventional treatments do not work for many people addicted to opioids and want to stop taking them			1
that 's why more than a half dozen countries in @entity215 and @entity201 have developed a second - line option : heroin - assisted treatment			1
with this treatment , pharmacological heroin is administered under strict controls in a clinical setting to those who have failed to succeed with other treatment options			0
virtually every published evaluation of @entity225 has shown extremely positive outcomes : major reductions in illicit drug use , crime , disease and overdose ; and improvements in health , well - being , social reintegration and treatment retention			0
no one can know for sure whether @entity3 would still be alive if these seven steps had been implemented , but we can be certain that far fewer @entity18 would die accidentally from an overdose if they were			1
while our country continues to mourn his death , we need to educate ourselves about the best policies and practices to reduce these tragic losses			0
some of these ideas may make us uncomfortable , but we need to embrace them as soon as possible			0
our sons and daughters , brothers and sisters are counting on it			0
the cost of a slow learning curve is simply too great			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers : actor @entity3 's death one of 105 people who die each day from overdose in @entity18
they say people will use heroin or opiates no matter what , so challenge is to help people
writers : make treatment easy , pass laws that let people call 911 without fear of arrest
they say we need to educate ourselves about treatments that might sound *radical* but work
