if laughter is the best medicine then @entity1 should be @entity4 's chief doctor			1
the comedian 's blend of laugh - out - loud humor and cheeky charm has brought him widespread following in his home country and abroad , and even landed him inside the pages of @entity13			1
however , he has followed an unorthodox path to success , having spent years working as a switch engineer for one of @entity4 's biggest telecoms companies			1
it was only when he entered a comedy competition on the encouragement of his sisters and came second that he realized he could make a living out of his funnyman persona			2
" i left my job in 2011 because i was making unserious money by being serious			2
i realized you can make serious money from being unserious , " @entity27 says			1
but leaving secure employment with a regular monthly paycheck had been far from easy , and the comedian had to quickly learn the ropes of being a freelance performer			0
some gigs would offer beer instead of payment , but @entity27 soon realized that that was n't going to help him pay his rent			1
" leaving my job was one of the hardest moments of my life , especially the first month , because i was n't sure how i was going to make ends meet , " he says			0
he even entertained the idea of returning to his old job , but in the end stuck with his new profession			0
" i was patient , because deep down in my heart i knew it was going to work			0
i did n't know how long it would take , but i definitely knew it was going to work , " he says			0
@entity53 mines his own personal experience for his show material , and attributes his success to his openness to talk about subjects that some comedians in @entity4 might avoid , such as sex , love and death			1
he says that , while he loved engineering , he always felt something was missing , and that he was n't using his full potential , but that comedy has helped him grow as a person			0
" when you do a joke today , there 's no way you 're going to do it tomorrow			2
so you 're challenged to do something better , you 're challenged to use your head , to use your mind , to use every part of your body to the best of your ability , " @entity27 says			1
" it has helped me actually exploit most of the things that i did n't know i could do			0
so i should say comedy has changed my life			0
