as a multi award - winning chef , bestselling author , tv channel proprietor and hugely successful syndicated show host , @entity0 is arguably the world 's most revered exponent of @entity9 cuisine			1
for the past 18 years he has concocted a handful of new recipes every week as the host of " @entity13 , " said to be @entity14 's most watched , and @entity16 's longest - running , cookery program			0
as if that were n't impressive enough , @entity0 has penned 36 cookbooks , while his website consistently attracts a hungry audience of 25 million users a month			1
suffice to say , the man has a distinguished rep in the venerable tradition of @entity9 cuisine			1
but the myriad blend of spices and stimulation of the senses that characterize his country 's culinary heritage could n't be more at odds with the restrained subtlety that dominates contemporary cooking in northern @entity35			2
so it is perhaps testament to @entity0 's desire for a challenge that he chose @entity39 , @entity40 , as the location for his " @entity42			1
" see more @entity43 here he would meet with , and learn from , @entity45 , head chef and proprietor of @entity47 , the two @entity44 ranked best in the world by @entity49 , where fresh ingredients and simplicity reign supreme			1
his mission was to synthesize the two divergent culinary traditions , and ultimately combine them into a completely original dish of his own			2
in his own words , @entity0 looks back over his @entity42			1
@entity0 : when you 've been in the profession for as long as i have , it 's imperative to keep making new discoveries , to go beyond your particular area of expertise			1
and the best way to do that is to travel			0
so i could n't resist the chance to fly to @entity39			1
with its @entity69 climate and classic @entity35 architecture , it 's a world away from @entity71 -- and the style of our cuisines are just as contrasting			0
the challenge is that from an @entity9 perspective taste is paramount			2
our savory dishes are more salty , our hot dishes are more hot , our sweet dishes are more sweet , our sour things are more sour			0
this is all because the use and blend of spices is very bold -- the objective is to embellish and we often have 15 to 20 contrasting herbs and spices in a single dish			0
but @entity45 and his @entity90 cuisine is all about simplicity			1
it 's all about passion and appreciation for the ingredients themselves			0
this philosophy was immediately apparent as soon as we journeyed out to the farms around @entity39 , where @entity45 buys most of his food directly			1
this emphasis on sourcing fresh ingredients , having a relationship with the producers , knowing the history of the food , is something i admire and relate to -- but not something that i 'm able to practice very often in my country			1
it 's an irony that the act of going to back to nature , as it were , is something that is so easy to do in @entity14 , and yet we have been going in the opposite direction			0
unlike a lot of the industrialized @entity117 , we 're generally much closer to our environment , but we do n't focus on it			0
instead , it is all becoming very commercial in nature			0
the food deliveries arrive at your kitchen and you wo n't know where it 's come from , how far its traveled , who the supplier is , what relationship they have with the grower and so on			2
this is a shame because you ca n't then guarantee the quality of the product and , on top of that , you lose the emotional connection to the food ... it becomes more like a commodity			2
see also : ballet star takes inspiration from @entity144 dance watching @entity45 work at @entity47 was a fascinating experience			1
he has so much reverence for the food and tries to keep the natural essence of his ingredients intact			0
so for instance , a simple carrot might be slow - roasted for hours , allowing it to soak in its own juices -- really bringing out its essential flavor			0
in @entity14 , we 're quick and explosive in the kitchen -- we 'd rarely cook a vegetable for longer than 15 minutes -- and the culture is about pleasing every taste sense on just one spoon , adding layers of flavor so that they all blend together			0
but then , of course , the individual ingredients are somewhat hidden			0
so , how to bring these two very different styles together in one dish ? i took the best of both			0
while @entity45 and i had been foraging , i 'd come across some wonderfully fresh and fragrant mustard leaves			1
it 's not too sharp yet it 's pungent and very mustardy ... something that i have grown up with as it 's very popular in traditional @entity9 cooking			2
i decided to blend this beautiful @entity178 salmon -- coating it with the mustard leaves and some lime , a little seasoning and let it cook gently			0
the result was a dish that had a distinctive @entity9 aroma , but with more of a @entity90 approach to the style and philosophy of preparation			1
the respect for the ingredient -- focusing on @entity193 , one leaf to the next -- has enabled me to return home with a new appreciation for what @entity9 cuisine still has to offer .			2
