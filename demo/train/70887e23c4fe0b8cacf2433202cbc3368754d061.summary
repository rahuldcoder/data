-- the @entity1 no longer owns the world 's fastest supercomputer			2
a computer called @entity5 , unveiled on wednesday at a conference in @entity7 , @entity8 , can run calculations faster than the previous speed leader , a computer at a @entity1 lab in @entity13			1
the new computer set a performance record by crunching 2.507 petaflops of data at once			1
the previous leader , a computer called @entity19 and located at the @entity20 , completed 1.75 petaflop calculations			0
analysts say the new record underscores @entity8 's place as a global tech leader			1
according to @entity28 , the computer technology company , the world 's fastest computer will be operated as an open access system and will be used for large scale scientific computations			2
supercomputers , which essentially are many computers strung and networked together , fill entire rooms and even small warehouses			0
they are often used to processes huge amounts of scientific data			0
climate models , for example , are run using the supercomputing power that 's found in @entity1 national labs			0
