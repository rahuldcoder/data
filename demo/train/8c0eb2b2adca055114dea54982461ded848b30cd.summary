in response to @entity28 's recent moves , @entity6 judges will meet saturday to discuss their next steps , including a possible nationwide strike that would halt all trials and court cases in the country , said judge @entity157			1
( @entity52 earlier said judges had already decided to strike			1
) on friday in @entity12 , thousands had @entity28 in mind as they chanted , " leave , leave , " and " the people want to topple the regime			2
" nearby , in front of @entity6 's parliament building , thousands of protesters threw rocks as police used their vehicles and tear gas to keep the crowd contained			0
the top floor of an eight - story apartment building caught on fire friday night , a blaze protesters blamed on a police tear gas canister tossed at demonstrators who were on top of the building earlier in the day			0
