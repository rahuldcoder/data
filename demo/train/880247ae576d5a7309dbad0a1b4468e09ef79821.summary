-- cpl. @entity1 will never forget june 12 , 2011			1
he was on his second deployment with the @entity3 in @entity4			1
another squad had been hit by two improvised explosive devices , and he was helping to clear the landing zone so a helicopter could pick up the casualties			1
" an ied was set off , and at first i did n't realize it was me that was hit , " he said			1
" i was in the air and looked down and realized both my feet were missing			1
" lying inside the crater from the blast , @entity1 began to tie a tourniquet around what was left of his right leg			2
" before i finished putting the tourniquet on , the doc got to me			2
he placed his hand on my shoulder and said , ' do n't worry brother			2
i got you , ' " he recalled			2
" it was a blessing that i stayed conscious because i did n't have to wake up later and realize that both of my legs were missing			2
" at 22 , @entity1 was a double - leg amputee			1
" the first two weeks were pretty hard			2
i struggled in my own head to try and picture the future of my life , and it was hard to see anything good out if it , " he said			2
before the accident , @entity1 loved to hunt and fish			1
but he questioned whether it would even be possible to do so without his legs			2
" i was trying to figure out in my mind what i was going to be able to do and what i was n't , " he said			2
thanks to an all - terrain wheelchair , @entity1 is one of a growing number of injured veterans and people with disabilities who are getting back to doing what they love outdoors			1
designed like a mini-tank , this wheelchair can go almost anywhere off road -- through mud , sand , snow and in up to a foot of water			0
it can even go up and down hills			0
@entity65 created the @entity66 about 10 years after his son was paralyzed in a car accident			1
" you do n't ever want to get that phone call , but it happened , " @entity65 said			0
" but i always thought about how can i get @entity72 back outdoors and off the hard surface ? " with 30 years ' experience in the motorsports business , @entity65 designed an off - road electric chair that could help more than just his son			1
" we just started using some of the things i knew about snowmobiles and @entity81 ( all - terrain vehicles ) ... along with electric wheelchair components			1
and we started building , " he said			0
" the tracks we use are similar in design and quality to snowmobile tracks			0
" the chair is controlled by a joystick and can travel up to 4 mph			0
it can be tilted to maintain balance on uneven terrain			1
" one of the biggest fears people in wheelchairs have is falling out of their chair , " @entity65 said			1
" the chairs all come with a tilt so if you 're going up and down hills ... you can maintain your chair being level			0
" the size of the chair can be adjusted to fit both children and adults			0
accessories such as trays , toolboxes and gun racks can also be mounted to them			0
@entity65 sold his first chair in 2009 from his factory in @entity116 , @entity117			0
about a year later , he began designing a second model -- one that allows paralyzed people to stand up			0
" there are some standing units out there for people that are on concrete but nothing off road , " @entity65 said			0
" i started thinking about how can we help these people stand up and be outdoors or working			1
" on this chair , the joystick allows paralyzed people to rise up slowly from a sitting to a standing position			0
they are held in place with knee supports , a seat belt and an optional shoulder harness			0
" when you can stand up , now you can go back working , you can paint the house , do some welding or build things outdoors , " he said			1
but mobility comes with a price			0
the standard chairs range from $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 and are not yet covered by insurance			1
@entity1 received his chair through the @entity149 , which provides aid to injured @entity152 military members			0
it has allowed him to get back to doing what he loves most -- hunting and fishing			0
" it turns your disability into an ability , " he said			0
" it 's made a huge difference ... and it 's added that independence back to my life			1

all - terrain wheelchairs helping disabled veterans , others who love the outdoors
wounded @entity3 *corporal* says he 's now able to hunt and fish
but the @entity66 sells for $ 10,000 to $ 12,000
all - terrain wheelchairs are not yet covered by much insurance
