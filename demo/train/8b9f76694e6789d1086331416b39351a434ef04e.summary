-- @entity2 officials have recommended immunity for a former @entity5 president implicated in a @entity2 federal court case over his alleged role in a 1997 massacre			1
survivors of the attack and heirs of the 45 villagers killed in the massacre filed a civil lawsuit last year , accusing former @entity5 president @entity15 of crimes against humanity			1
a court filing from the @entity2 government friday supported @entity15 's argument that he should be immune from prosecution			1
lawyers for plaintiffs in responded saturday by stating they understand the former president now has immunity as a result , thereby preventing them from proceeding with their case against him			2
" the alleged actions as set forth in the complaint are predicated on former president @entity15 's actions as president of @entity5 , thus involving the exercise of his powers of office , " the @entity2 government court filing said			1
the filing concluded by saying " the @entity2 has determined that former president @entity15 enjoys immunity from this lawsuit			1
" arguments that @entity15 " should be held liable for lower level officials ' tortious conduct simply by virtue of his position as president at the time " were not enough to change the @entity51 's assessment , officials said in the filing			1
@entity15 claims immunity the lead attorneys representing plaintiffs in the case said they were " deeply disappointed by the @entity51 's decision , " which they said will " prevent us from ... presenting proof of ( @entity15 's ) responsibility for the 1997 @entity60			1
" " based on the substantial testimony and documentation that we have collected , we are extremely confident that the highest levels of mr. @entity15 's government had advance knowledge of and directly participated in the conspiracy that led to @entity60 and its cover - up , " @entity71 - based lawyers @entity69 and @entity72 said , according to a statement released saturday			2
the attorneys also criticized the @entity2 government for basing its decision " on communications between mr. @entity15 , the current @entity5 government and the @entity2 government " that were not related to the plaintiff 's lawyers or the general public			1
@entity15 himself did not immediately respond to requests for comment			0
the case has been closely watched on both sides of the border , particularly as the six - year term of current @entity5 president @entity91 -- whose administration has been accused by some of human rights abuses in the nation 's drug war -- nears its end			0
@entity15 was @entity5 's president from 1994 to 2000			2
the civil case against him was filed nearly a year ago in @entity100 , where @entity15 resides while he teaches at @entity101			0
it accuses him of being responsible for the killings of 45 villagers in the southern @entity5 state of @entity106 , and afterward conspiring to cover it up			2
ten anonymous plaintiffs were seeking about $ 50 million in damages against him , according to court documents			0
although the killings happened in @entity5 , the lawsuit argued that a long list of @entity2 laws and international treaties -- including the @entity116 and @entity117 -- give the @entity2 federal court jurisdiction to try the case			0
the killings occurred on december 22 , 1997 , and are considered among the more brutal incidents during an armed conflict that began three years earlier in southern @entity5 after @entity123 rebels pushed for more rights for indigenous people			0
@entity15 has denied allegations that his office was somehow responsible for the deaths			1
" these anonymous accusations that president @entity15 was somehow complicit in the events in @entity133 are baseless and outrageous , " he said in a january court filing			0
" the december 1997 attack in @entity133 was an appalling tragedy			0
but that tragedy was not the result of an elaborate conspiracy by the @entity5 federal government , masterminded by president @entity15			0
" @entity0 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity144 's lawyers criticize @entity15 being granted immunity , say he knew about the killings
heirs of 45 @entity150 villagers killed in 1997 accused @entity15 of crimes against humanity
the @entity155 president denied allegations his office was responsible for their deaths
@entity2 supports giving him immunity , saying he is *n't* liable for lower level officials ' actions
