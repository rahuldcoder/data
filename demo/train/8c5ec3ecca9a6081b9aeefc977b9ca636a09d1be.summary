@entity0 , @entity1 -- in september of 2005 , no one could have anticipated what we saw in @entity0 last week			1
what happened on the football field and parade route after the @entity11 ' @entity10 victory is amazing and uplifting			1
but what 's happening elsewhere in @entity0 also rises to that standard			1
consider the following : the day before the @entity10 , @entity0 participated in a historic mayoral election , as lt. gov. @entity15 won a stunning 66 - percent of the vote , with unprecedented support among all races			1
@entity21 - @entity20 candidates also won down - ballot races with majority white support , casting a blow to the notion that @entity0 politics and culture are mired in racial tension			1
just weeks before , federal arbitrators awarded $ 475 million to @entity1 for the replacement of @entity31 in downtown @entity0 which makes way for a multibillion dollar medical corridor that is being billed as the largest development project in the city 's history			1
and in late 2009 , a federal judge ruled that the @entity39 ' mismanagement at the @entity40 was the cause for flood damage in the @entity43 and @entity44 following @entity45 and @entity46			0
damages paid to local governments and residents will exceed $ 1 billion			0
these judgments validate many locals ' beliefs that the flooding of 80 percent of @entity0 and the billions of dollars in damage were caused more by massive engineering failures than a natural disaster			1
to that point , the government is working on a $ 15 billion upgrade to the region 's 220 - plus miles of levees and flood walls that , when completed , will allow them to withstand a storm with a strength level that occurs roughly once every 100 years			0
even today , experts will tell you the levees are better than they were before @entity67			0
additionally , the population is nearing 80 percent of pre-katrina levels , in part due to hardworking residents who came back and a new crop of younger , entrepreneurial transplants moving to the city to be part of what is going on here			2
the @entity0 economy is bearing the recession better than most , evidenced in one of the lowest unemployment rates of any major metropolitan area in the country			1
also , the city now has a bond rating that is investment - grade , which should free up access to tens of millions of dollars for infrastructure improvements			1
one of the brightest spots in @entity87 has been in education			1
in @entity0 , academic performance scores in the school district have risen nearly 25 percent			1
the school system looks to get a ten - figure lump - sum settlement to rebuild school properties across the city			2
and with over half of its students in charter schools and a large and influential @entity99 corps , @entity0 has become a laboratory and model for education reform			1
all of this is not to say that everything is going perfectly in @entity0			1
mayor - elect @entity15 and @entity105 still have remarkable challenges to tackle and tough decisions to make -- including reducing violent crime , eliminating blighted housing , continuing to rebuild communities and business , and restoring wetlands that provide much needed storm protection			2
but there is a unity of purpose ( thanks in large part to the @entity11 ) that was n't there even six months ago			2
the recovery and rebirth includes citizen - driven reform of local government -- a government once marked by corruption , nepotism , incompetence and the like			0
@entity128 voted to consolidate the seven assessor 's offices , the criminal and civil sheriffs , and the various levee boards			0
but most importantly , @entity134 elected an outstanding man as mayor this past saturday to lead the next phase of recovery			0
the mayoral election was nothing short of staggering , and the confluence of the @entity11 win and the historic mayoral election , lined up for the city 's best two days since the @entity144 in 1815			1
@entity15 was elected in the primary ( there will be no runoff ) with 66 percent of the vote , including 63 percent of african - americans and 70 percent of white voters			2
to say this broad support is unprecedented would be a gross understatement			0
@entity15 becomes the first white mayor to govern the majority - @entity21 - @entity20 city in some 30 years			1
( his father , @entity155 , was the last white mayor			0
) and he does it after winning all but one precinct in the primary election			0
in @entity163 , businesses , congressional leaders , nonprofit organizations and average citizens will finally have a leader and partner in a united city government that promises to restore confidence and get dollars flowing to projects that need them			0
add to that the fact that @entity0 will be front and center on the world stage for much of the next decade , hosting a series of national and international sporting events , including @entity175 in 2013 , back - to - back @entity178 men 's and women 's @entity179 , and the @entity180 in 2012 , among many others			2
in 2015 , the nation will celebrate the 200th anniversary of the @entity144			0
and in 2018 , @entity0 ' tricentenary will focus not only on the founding of @entity0 but also its successful rebirth 300 years later			1
you see , the effort to rebuild and recover has been not just an engineering feat to save a city , an entire culture has been at stake			0
we have our own cuisine , music , architecture , funeral traditions , literature and cultural structure			0
and as of late , it looks like it will be preserved			0
more restaurants are in operation than before the hurricane , @entity128 took home two grammy awards this past year , and many important cultural sites have reopened recently or are scheduled to reopen soon			0
the world should take notice			0
thanks to the @entity11 , you 're looking			2
but take a deeper glimpse beyond football at what 's going on here			0
for as challenging a decade as the 2000s were for @entity0 , the 2010s may prove to be the brightest time in the city 's nearly 300 - year history			1
@entity0 is not just coming back and not just on its way back			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

@entity221 : @entity0 is experiencing a historic rebirth
he says the @entity11 victory has given the city a big lift
election of @entity15 and major infrastructure investments are making a *difference* , he says
@entity221 : improvements in education one of the brightest parts of @entity0 ' rebirth
