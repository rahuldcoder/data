the @entity0 has a history of often picking sides in @entity4 conflicts to its own detriment			1
in the 1980s , former secretary of defense @entity6 met with @entity7 to establish a relationship that helped the dictator gain access to @entity0 arms during @entity13 's war with @entity14			1
in the 1990s , the @entity0 would drive former ally @entity7 from @entity15 and impose a decade of sanctions that were devastating for @entity13 , but had little effect on the dictator			2
in 2003 , we went to @entity13 , overthrew @entity7 , and became part of nation - building effort from which we only recently saw most of our soldiers return home			0
arguably one of the greatest beneficiaries of the @entity13 war was @entity14 , which now enjoys more power and influence with the elimination of its historic enemy			0
president @entity31 did not pursue @entity7 directly during @entity32 precisely because he feared the destabilizing effects it might have on the region , or as his secretary of defense @entity36 explained in 1994 , " once you got to @entity13 and took it over , took down @entity7 's government , then what are you going to put in its place ? " today , @entity13 is unstable and its future uncertain			0
@entity44 eventually accepted responsibility in the 1988 bombing of an airplane over @entity48 , @entity49 , that killed hundreds of people , including @entity0 schoolchildren			1
president @entity52 called @entity44 the " mad dog of the @entity4			1
" fast forward to 2008 , when secretary of state @entity54 traveled to @entity55 to meet with @entity44 to offer @entity0 support			1
in 2009 , members of the @entity58 -- republicans @entity59 and @entity61 and an independent , @entity62 -- would travel to @entity55 to meet with @entity44 to offer further aid			1
sen. @entity61 said : " we discussed the possibility of moving ahead with the provision of nonlethal defense equipment to the government of @entity55			2
" president @entity69 would eventually meet with @entity44 to reconfirm the same relationship established during the @entity31 administration			2
by 2011 , president @entity69 was arming @entity55 rebels and ordering airstrikes to overthrow @entity44			1
some of the president 's most vocal supporters were the same republicans who traveled to @entity55 two years before to help @entity55 's strongman acquire military equipment			2
sen. @entity61 said of the @entity55 rebels : " i have met with these brave fighters , and they are not @entity80			1
... to the contrary : they are @entity55 patriots who want to liberate their nation			2
we should help them do it			0
" we did help them , something i opposed on the @entity58 floor as an unconstitutional overreach by the executive branch			0
we now have reason to believe that the @entity55 rebels did contain elements of @entity80 and other @entity96 extremists			1
visit strengthens @entity61 's resolve for @entity0 intervention in @entity100 now we see the same enthusiasm for another @entity0 intervention , this time in @entity100			1
the @entity103 approved last week by the @entity104 , of which i am a member , has the potential to create more problems for the @entity0 than it would solve			2
it is unclear what national security interests we have in the civil war in @entity100			2
it is very clear that any attempt to aid the @entity100 rebels would be complicated and dangerous , precisely because we do n't know who these people are			1
the situation in @entity100 is certainly dire			2
at least 70,000 people have died , and @entity80 is making confirmed inroads into the country			0
no one wants to see @entity100 become a bastion of extremism			0
but like other @entity0 interventions in the past , @entity0 involvement could actually help the extremists			0
there is also the quandary of nearly 2 million @entity128 who are uncertain of what to do			0
the @entity131 community in @entity100 has traditionally sided with , and been protected by , @entity133 's regime			0
it is troubling to think that @entity0 arms may be given to @entity96 fighters who may in turn be firing them at @entity128			0
this month , it was reported that the @entity80 - linked @entity139 in @entity100 executed 11 men who were part of @entity133 's forces			0
@entity100 dictator @entity133 is no friend to the @entity0 -- but neither is @entity80			1
to aid members of @entity80 in any way , directly or indirectly , is an insult to our brave men and women who 've been fighting these terrorists since 9/11			0
perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this " transition support act " is that it would commit the @entity0 to a leadership position in the restoration of @entity100 , and is very vague about what that looks like			1
the language of " capacity building " contained in this act is an open - ended term that if logically followed , could eventually mean @entity0 troops on the ground in @entity100			1
we " capacity built " in both @entity13 and @entity164			0
those who insist this language could never mean @entity0 boots on the ground in @entity100 belong to the same @entity169 clique eager to support @entity7 , @entity44 and later , the @entity55 rebels			1
@entity169 is not exempt from the law of unintended consequences			0
empowering @entity96 extremists to achieve questionable short - term goals does not serve @entity0 's long - term security or interests			0
nor does it serve the interests of nearly 2 million christians in @entity100 who fear they could suffer the same fate as @entity13 @entity128 who were abused and expelled from that country as radical @entity96 forces gained influence and power			1
these @entity128 are natural allies of the @entity0 , and if we 're going to seriously discuss any @entity0 interests in @entity100 , the welfare of these @entity128 is more important than arming @entity96 extremists			1
history 's primary lesson is that we must learn from the past			0
although there are some well - intentioned reasons for wanting to intervene in @entity100 , there are far more well - documented reasons not to .			0

@entity197 : @entity0 has a habit of picking the *wrong* sides in @entity4 conflicts
@entity197 : first , @entity0 supported @entity44 in @entity55 ; switched sides to support rebels
we do n't know who the rebels in @entity100 are , he says
@entity197 : we must also consider how rebels might treat @entity100 christians
