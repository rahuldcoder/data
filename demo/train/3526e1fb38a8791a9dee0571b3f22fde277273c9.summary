the person died sunday in @entity33 's critical care unit , the hospital said			1
" the patient was already an outpatient at @entity33 , undergoing treatment for a long - term , complex unrelated health condition , " the hospital said			1

" the first patient , who had traveled recently to @entity17 and @entity45 , was being treated , the @entity23 said			0
the third case had " a mild illness " and has recovered			0

dr. @entity53 , a medical epidemiologist in the @entity14 's @entity54 , agreed			0

" people should n't freak out , " she added			0
" there 's no evidence that this virus is easily spread , say , across a room			2
" however , human - to - human transmission is not impossible , as seen in the @entity20 cases			1
