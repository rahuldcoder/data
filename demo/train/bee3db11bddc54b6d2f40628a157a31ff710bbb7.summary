-- everyone on the @entity2 knew thursday that monstrous @entity4 , energizing over bathtub - warm ocean waters , was heading toward them , posing the biggest hurricane threat to the @entity7 in six years			1
what they did not know was the exact path of the storm			1
so people along a 700 - mile stretch of the @entity2 were , as @entity15 gov. @entity14 put it , preparing for the worst and praying for the best			1
there was even a possibility that the storm , which could reach category 4 status , could slam into @entity21 , causing concerns about soaring skyscrapers and underground tunnels			1
a state of emergency has already been declared in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and parts of @entity15 in anticipation of @entity4			1
fears were perhaps greatest in @entity15 and @entity26 and on the slivers of islands that extend off those coastlines , which could start feeling @entity4 's punch by friday evening			1
on @entity15 's @entity40 , there is only one way off the island -- by ferry			1
the county ordered tourists and residents to evacuate			1
@entity47 , the emergency manager for the @entity48 , said more than 1,500 people left wednesday			1
the ferries are operating all day thursday , he said , but the last chance for anyone to get off the isolated , skinny island sticking out in the @entity2 , is one boat friday morning			1
after that , well , you are out of options			1
@entity58 was one of about 100 @entity40 residents still around thursday night			1
in between playing progressive rock songs on community radio @entity61 , he talked about residents making final preparations			1
" you pick up stuff that will float			1
" " this is a little more serious than many of them , " @entity58 said , referring to other storms in the region			1
@entity71 in 2003 and @entity72 in 2004 did have significant impact			1
residents have a couple grocery stores , ice and an emergency electrical source to help them ride out and recover from @entity4			1
" as long as the storm is in progress , you are on your own , " @entity58 said			1
@entity47 has lived through 15 hurricanes in his lifetime : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86			1
he 's used to boarding up his home in coastal @entity88 and firing up the generator			2
you might call him a veteran			2
" you 're a veteran of one and they still keep coming , " he said			2
@entity4 ? well , it will be another name on the long list			1
@entity95 has only one name in her hurricane memory			1
" it was scary , " she said			2
so much so that @entity95 was not taking any chances			2
she arrived at her rented vacation condo on @entity102 just this monday			2
but by thursday , she was safely back home in @entity104 , @entity26 , buying extra bottles of water and gas for the grill , in case the power goes out			2
in @entity112 , @entity15 , @entity111 planned a dream wedding for saturday -- along the @entity114 , of course			1
" literally my first reaction was , ' nooo ! , ' " @entity111 told @entity0 affiliate @entity117			2
she had planned to walk down the aisle in the front yard of her mother 's house ; the reception was to be in the back yard , along the water			2
" as of now , it looks like it 's just going to be a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind , and it just looks like we need to move the event from outside to inside , so that 's what we 're planning , " muscle said			2
she 's hoping a perfect storm wo n't ruin her perfect day			2
on @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , surfers since they were kids , hoped to ride a few waves like they do in every hurricane the @entity15 natives have lived through			1
the winds are too high during the hit , but the swell before and after the storm could be ideal			2
but this time , it 's different			2
not because @entity4 is so huge , or that she is eyeing the @entity151			1
but this time , the young couple owns a house			2
this time , they have a 2 - year - old daughter to protect			2
if it looks like a direct hit , @entity141 plans to evacuate with their child			2
@entity142 will stay to look after the house and the surf shop that @entity141 manages			2
" we are going to wait until tomorrow afternoon to make a decision , " @entity163 said			0
in the meantime , they 've brought in the tomato plants , picked up debris and tied down everything that needs to be secured			0
and they cut dead branches off the tall pines in their yard			0
farther north in @entity177 , @entity30 , @entity175 is planning to ride out the storm along with her husband , @entity181 , and dog , @entity183			1
" our plan is not to leave , " @entity184 said			0
" temporary shelters will not take the dog , and we feel that our house is elevated enough that we would avoid any possible storm surge			0
" @entity184 , who lives about half a mile from the @entity191 , said she and her husband are securing several items in their yard , including outdoor furniture and a 14 - foot aluminum boat			0
" we 're going to hope for the best as far as the cars go , " she said , noting that they do n't have a garage			0
@entity184 said she plans to fill her tub with water , and may stock up on extra beer as well			1
" we had some really bad storms this past fall and winter with gusts clocked up to 70 miles per hour			0
we know we can get through that , " she said			0
" but you do n't want to get cocky			0
if we get 100 - mile per hour winds , that 's a different ballgame			0
we 've never lived through that			0
" in nearby @entity210 , 71 - year - old @entity209 was taking steps to protect his restaurant , @entity213			0
@entity209 , a lifelong resident of the area , is planning to cover all of the windows at the restaurant , take down loose signs outside and bring in his trash cans			0
@entity209 said he will probably close his business			0
he 's also bringing in a supply of dry ice to help preserve the restaurant 's food in case power is lost			0
as for himself , @entity209 said he would probably " go inland a little bit " and seek shelter with his 90 - year - old mother if the storm becomes severe enough			0
@entity209 's wife stocked up extra milk , water and batteries			0
some described their preparations as " minimal , " such as @entity236 in @entity237 , @entity238			0
but " i 've got my chainsaw sharpened , and i 've got my tractor ready to clear the way " if there are a lot of downed trees , he said			0
@entity236 predicted that traffic at his business -- @entity247 and @entity248 in @entity249 -- will " probably drop off to nothing , at least temporarily			0
" but the place will stay open as long as it can , @entity236 said			0
thursday , he was already taking down several awnings , tents , and umbrellas			0
if nothing else , he joked , he would hold @entity256 's annual employee party during the storm			0
meanwhile , the owner of @entity259 at @entity260 in @entity28 said he 's preparing for the worst			1
he 's going to put as many as 150 sandbags in front of his water 's edge store			0
" i will stay here as long as i can , " @entity265 said			0
" most storms i ride out , but for the first time in 15 years i 'm thinking of not riding this one out			1
" i think the storm will head right up the @entity270 at this point , " he said			0
" and locally , i do n't think we 're prepared			0
nobody 's boarding up anything , and there could be some major devastation			0
" stores even farther north in @entity277 were also gearing up for @entity4			1
the emergency display was up at the @entity280 in @entity281 , reported @entity0 affiliate @entity282			0
and extra supplies of sump pumps			1
@entity287 , who works for a restoration company , warned residents of @entity4 's strong winds			1
" @entity292 shingles used in the @entity294 area are good only for 75 miles per hour , " he said			0
older ones could blow off in even lighter winds			0
in @entity298 , @entity238 , the sun beat down thursday			0
no sign of @entity4 yet , but people asked : " what if ? " boat owners in @entity303 began removing their vessels , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity305			1
some people find it exciting , the prospect of a hurricane -- generally thought of as a @entity311 thing -- heading to @entity294			1
but veterans were quick to say " beware			1
" " they 're exciting until they get a week into not having hot water , refrigerator , running around for ice and no electric power , " said @entity313 , a charter boat captain			0
" the excitement wears off quick			0
" the reality is that many folks on the @entity2 were still in a wait - and - see mode thursday , as @entity4 -- slowly but surely -- made her way toward them			1
@entity0 's @entity324 contributed to this report .			0
