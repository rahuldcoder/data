he says he shot the teenager in self - defense , but prosecutors accuse him of unjustly profiling and killing @entity30			1
an initial decision by police not to pursue charges in the case led to the dismissal of the town 's police chief and sparked fresh debates about race relations and gun laws in the @entity45			0
@entity3 is @entity18 ; @entity30 was african - american			1
opinion : the facts must decide @entity30 case @entity8 began the day by explaining the definition of reasonable doubt to the jury pool			1
he said it 's a complicated concept that even " third - year law students " can have difficulty understanding			0
@entity8 questioned the 40 potential jurors about a variety of topics , including their beliefs about gun ownership and their thoughts on self - defense			1

the technology may be key to the prosecution 's case , because their experts ' testimony may be able to shed light on what was said between @entity3 and @entity30 moments before the teenager was shot			1
if the analysis indicates @entity30 screamed for help , it could hurt the credibility of @entity3 's claim that he acted in self - defense			1
