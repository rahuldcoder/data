-- @entity2 - born @entity1 has become the first muslim to be selected in an @entity5 cricket squad -- and could now play against his country of birth in @entity8 next month			1
@entity1 , who was born in @entity9 but moved to @entity10 at the age of four , said he was " shocked " at being selected for the two - @entity13 series , which was moved to @entity14 due to safety concerns in @entity2 due to last year 's extremist attack on the @entity19 cricket team bus			1
" i was a bit shocked , i had a feeling i was close but that could mean absolutely nothing , " he told @entity21 's official website			0
" the feeling did n't really sink in straight away but i 've told my family and they 're really excited			0
" @entity1 , who is also a fully - qualified pilot , was named in a strong 14 - man @entity5 side for the series which begins on july 13			1
the 23 - year - old made headlines in 2008 when he became the first cricketer of @entity34 - @entity5 background to play first - class cricket in @entity10 , making his debut for @entity37 in an inter-state match against @entity39			1
he is , however , not the first player from the sub-continent to represent @entity10 -- @entity43 - born @entity42 played seven tests in 1979 - 80			1
national selection panel chairman @entity45 said @entity1 's inclusion in the squad was down to the player 's strong performances at state competition level , which saw him score 698 runs and three centuries last season			2
" @entity1 has been selected on the back of some very strong @entity59 performances , " @entity45 said in a statement on @entity21 's official website			2
" he is seen by the panel as being capable of batting anywhere in the order in test cricket , but importantly for this particular series as a top - order batsman who could bat in the top four should the opportunity arise			0
" fast bowler @entity70 also returned to the squad after missing out on the tour of @entity73 in march with knee tendonitis			0
his inclusion is timely , as he is considered vital to @entity10 's bid to regain the @entity77 when @entity14 tour @entity78 in november			2
" @entity70 has successfully returned from injury during the current @entity81 in @entity82 , " @entity45 said			0
" @entity70 was a critical member of our 2009 ashes bowling group and it is very pleasing to see him back in the @entity13 squad with the next @entity77 series just around the corner			0
" left - arm fast bowler @entity90 and wicketkeeper @entity91 have also been included after both recovered from elbow injuries			0
the two tests between @entity10 and @entity2 will take place at @entity96 in @entity97 on july 13 - 17 and @entity98 in @entity99 from july 21 - 25 .			1
