@entity0 says the @entity2 spacecraft recorded the aftermath of a massive storm on @entity5 that let out an " unprecedented belch of energy			2
" not only was the size of the storm unusual , but what the storm was made of left scientists puzzled			2
the source of the cosmic burp , which rapidly changed the atmosphere 's temperature , was ethylene gas , an odorless , colorless gas that has rarely been observed on @entity5 , @entity0 said			1
" this temperature spike is so extreme it 's almost unbelievable , " said @entity19 , the study 's lead author who works at @entity21			0
" to get a temperature change of the same scale on @entity27 , you 'd be going from the depths of winter in @entity29 , @entity30 , to the height of summer in the @entity32 , " @entity19 said in a statement released by @entity0			1
@entity0 's @entity33 gets first look at black hole at the center of the @entity37 scientists still have n't figured out from where the ethylene gas came			0
by comparison , a storm of similar size on @entity27 would cover @entity45 from top to bottom and wrap the planet many times , researchers said			1
the @entity2 spacecraft first detected the disruption on december 5 , 2010 , and has been following it since , but researchers said the ethylene gas disruption that followed the storm was unexpected			1
a storm this size happens once every 30 years , or once every @entity5 year , @entity0 scientists said			2
launched in 1997 , the @entity2 is a cooperative project of @entity0 , the @entity58 and the @entity59			0
a full report will be published in november 's issue of the @entity62			0

the storm , first detected in 2010 , let out something of a cosmic burp
if on @entity27 , it would cover @entity45 top to bottom and wrap the *globe* many times
the storm also led to a *drastic* change in the *ringed* planet
