@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 are in for a significant cultural shift next week if the @entity4 approves a new law from president @entity6 to allow more shops to open on sundays			1
the law would permit shops , department stores , and shopping malls to open on sundays in 20 zones			1
what seems routine in much of the western world has been fiercely resisted in @entity1 , where sundays have officially been set aside as a day of rest for more than a century and where a 35 - hour workweek remains the norm			2
the new legislation , if approved by the @entity4 , would overturn a 1906 law that forbids sunday trading in all but the largest cities			1
it is part of a raft of reforms @entity6 has pushed for since becoming president			2
while the change is significant , it is not as much as the government originally hoped because @entity6 had to deal with opposition from both the left and the right			1
socialists filed thousands of amendments to the president 's original version of the law			0
leftists and unions said it would effectively introduce a seven - day workweek and allow bosses to force employees to work sundays			0
members of the president 's own ruling conservative party opposed the law despite assurances it would boost economic activity , saying it would instead deprive families and church groups of their dedicated day			0
if approved by the @entity4 , the law would permit shops , department stores , and shopping malls to open on sundays in 20 zones of what are called " exceptional commercial " centers near three of the country 's largest cities : @entity0 , @entity62 , and @entity63			1
additionally , 29 areas involving about 500 cities and towns would be added to the list of tourist areas , which already allow some economic activity on sundays			0
the new law will , among other things , straighten out a somewhat chaotic situation in which some stores managed to obtain exceptions from the old law and others did n't , and where some stores found it made more sense financially to accept fines for breaking the old law because the income from sunday sales more than made up for the penalties			0
the measure passed the @entity86 last tuesday by a vote of 282 to 238			0
it will go the @entity4 for three days of debate next tuesday , where it is almost certain to be approved			1
opinion polls in @entity1 show that slightly more than half the population want shops to have the freedom to open on sundays , according to @entity95			2
@entity2 's @entity96 contributed to this report .			0
