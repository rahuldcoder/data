the first @entity1 lawmaker to serve on the @entity2 said friday that the violence perpetrated by @entity7 radicals in the name of their religion " certainly does n't represent the [ @entity1 ] religion " and encouraged those of all faiths to come together to stop it			1
" it 's not any different than those who claim to be @entity18 or @entity19 or @entity20 and commit atrocious acts , " @entity13 rep. @entity12 said on @entity3 's @entity14 of the attacks			1
" i think it 's clear that we will never win the war on national terrorism , or even global terrorism for that matter , without getting help from @entity1 , getting help from @entity30 , getting help from non-theists — those who are committed to keeping our country safer and making the world a better place to live , " he added			2
@entity12 's religion has become a flashpoint for criticism from conservatives following his appointment to the @entity2 this week			1
conservative publications have raised questions about his ties to @entity45 groups that have been investigated for allegedly supporting terrorism , and his comments during a 2012 speech that @entity49 public schools should look to @entity7 schools as a model			1
but a top @entity52 came to his defense this week , with @entity55 rep. @entity54 , vice-chairman of the @entity13 caucus , saying the comments " offended " him in a letter to members			0
" these comments deeply offend me , as i 'm sure they offend all of you , which is why i hope all of us will take every opportunity to renounce these kinds of comments and discourage this kind of harmful talk , " he wrote			0
on friday , @entity12 thanked @entity54 for his support and @entity71 minority leader @entity70 for her " boldness " in appointing him to the @entity2 , and said that " for the most part , folks have been very excited about this opportunity on both sides of the aisle			1
" he also weighed in on the elevated terror threat in @entity79 and the 10,000 troops the @entity79 government deployed across the country this week as a precautionary measure , following a week of violent attacks from individuals who 've claimed ties to @entity87 and other terrorist groups			0
@entity12 said he believes there is " more to unearth and discover " about the threat facing @entity79 , and was supportive of the troop deployment , which he said was " a start " — but cautioned against the government overstepping its bounds			2
" i know they certainly do n't want to become a totalitarian state , but in protecting the rights of citizens there 's a delicate balance between keeping people safe and surveilling the citizens to the point where we are targeting people specifically — not because of race , not because of religion , but making sure we are targeting the right people and eliminating the threat to make people safer , " he said			2
he would not endorse a further commitment of troops from the @entity49 to fight the growing threat posed by @entity87 in the @entity113 , saying " we do n't want to have what we had in @entity115 , " but said while the administration has done a " fantastic job " addressing the threat , " there 's more to be done			0
" " we can not win this war unless we get help from our friends in the @entity121 and the international community			0
it 's very clear , " he said .			0
