-- maybe marriage to @entity2 is n't all that bad			0
@entity5 and @entity6 star as a couple on the road in the comedy " @entity3			1
" after cruelly dissecting marital malaise in " @entity12 " and again , just six months ago , in " @entity10 , " @entity2 's husband @entity9 takes a slightly more optimistic view of family life in the edgy comedy " @entity3			1
" not that he 's offering a whole - hearted endorsement of the institution			1
@entity18 and @entity19 ( @entity6 and @entity5 ) are n't legally bound -- she staunchly resists his repeated proposals -- but nevertheless they 're a couple about to go nuclear : she 's six months pregnant			1
he sells insurance to insurance companies			0
she 's an illustrator with a lucrative line in anatomical drawings			2
nevertheless , they 're struggling to make ends meet			0
" are we losers ? " wonders @entity19 ( only she uses a more colorful expression )			0
" we have cardboard windows ... i think we must be			0
" insomuch as they have a plan at all , it hinges on the support they 're expecting from @entity18 's doting parents			1
so it 's a nasty wake - up call when @entity43 ( @entity42 and @entity44 ) announce they 're taking off for a new life in @entity47 -- yes , even before the baby 's out			1
there is a silver lining : realizing they no longer have any reason to stay , @entity18 and @entity19 decide to widen their horizons			0
they could move to @entity57 where @entity19 's sister lives			2
@entity18 has a job prospect in @entity60 , @entity61			0
or they have college friends in @entity64			0
their destiny awaits them , all they have to do is go out and find it			0
although the couple racks up a good few miles in their search for home , the movie does n't betray much interest in location			1
@entity57 is hot and arid			0
in @entity64 they pour gravy on @entity81 fries			0
do n't expect cultural insights			0
it 's never explained how these stragglers can afford such speculative wandering , and when they do find their dream home it 's mystifying that it has n't occurred to them before			2
still , the movie 's loose - limbed , spontaneous quality is a good part of its appeal , and a refreshing change of pace from other movies by @entity9 , whose artfully designed compositions often seem self - conscious and painfully detached			1
in keeping with @entity99 's vogue for shuffling snide satire and sentimentality ( see " @entity102 " and " @entity103 " ) , " @entity3 " presents its trepidatious travelers with half a dozen starkly contrasted parental figures , including @entity109 's monstrously vulgar alcoholic , @entity108 's radical earth - mother ( who has shortened her name to " ln " ) , and @entity113 as @entity18 's rawly dumped brother , who wonders aloud if it would be wrong to tell his daughter her mom has been murdered			1
there 's a level of bile here that some audiences may find alienating -- i ca n't see it being a big hit in @entity125 -- but @entity126 ' and @entity128 's writing is a cut above the average , and it 's performed with gusto			2
they may not be the most dynamic duo to hit the road , but the relationship between @entity18 and @entity19 feels touchingly true			1
@entity18 is a boy still trying on manhood for size ( with a beard for extra emphasis ) , and though we 've seen @entity6 do this before , he seems to have fine - tuned the performance to the point where he could very happily play it for the next two decades			1
unlike his character , he 's an actor who has found himself			2
@entity5 is the joy of this picture			1
give or take her role in @entity150 's " @entity149 , " the " @entity152 " star has n't made much impact in movies before now			1
with her frazzled , freckled face , she 's not the glamour girl who would normally be shoe - horned into the romantic lead , but she seizes her chance and runs with it			1
@entity9 brings out a more thoughtful and nuanced presence than the brittle comedienne , and @entity163 makes you consider how rarely we see a real woman at the center of things			1
even her occasional tentativeness works for the part			2
@entity19 is so fresh and alert , she ca n't help but doubt herself as they trail from one family disaster to the next and wonder what kind of parents they are going to make			0
it 's an uneven picture about the bumps in the road , and not immune to the odd dramatic shortcut or jocular cheap shot			2
but it does catch an anxiety that will be acutely familiar to anyone contemplating imminent parenthood , and -- in a beautifully judged cameo by @entity185 -- the deep anguish of someone who has had that prospect snatched away			0
more often than not , and where it really counts , " @entity3 " hits home			0
" @entity3 " is rated r and runs 98 minutes			0
