-- dear mr. @entity1 , @entity2 to you ! i hope you are enjoying may the 4th , the day fans of your movies have turned into an unofficial holiday celebrating the world you have created , and which we love			1
as you -- or whomever you pay to do it -- look through the social networks and see your fans declaring " may the 4th be with you , " please stop and think about how you have turned it into a bad marketing ploy for the @entity19 release of the " @entity21 " movies			1
i am sure by now that all is revealed on the official @entity21 may the 4th day page , and now enough people have spread the word of how you are revealing images and information from the upcoming release of the movies on @entity19			1
in order to see more and more extras , they had to press a " share this site " button , spamming their friends in order to get a glimpse of the forthcoming dvds			1
i am sure the extras revealed through the site will give fans plenty to talk and debate about			2
i , for one , am excited to see the special features and hear the commentary tracks that have been revealed and every other part of the @entity36 when we get them in september			0
but that 's months from now			2
today is a special day , just for fans			2
why , then , would you take advantage of your fans to promote something that we wo n't even get to buy until september 16 ? why do this now ? is there a chance that you did not know why may the 4th was special to " @entity21 " fans ? that it is a day we all get to say , " may the 4th be with you , " a play on your great line , " may the force be with you , " with unabashed geekiness ? this is a day when fans get to show the world how much we love the " @entity21 " world you created ; a day to show just how large the fan base is ; that " @entity21 " is one of the greatest movies ever made			1
did n't you know ? did you think we would n't buy the dvds in record numbers ? are the preorders on @entity72 not hitting big enough totals for your liking ? of course most , if not all , of your fans will buy the " new " versions of these movies			2
and just like i said in my last letter to you -- you did get my last letter , right ? i only ask because i never heard back from you , so i was just wondering -- i am sad to say , we 'll buy them all over again when you release " newer " versions of them in the future			0
but i ask again , sir , why today ? it 's a little funny that you are using the fans and their social networks to reveal tantalizing tidbits of the upcoming @entity91 when you recently announced the official @entity21 forums will be closing on june 3			1
it is also interesting that by yesterday the forums were already locked down to read - only			0
does that mean that it 's ok to use your fans ' voices to promote a product but it 's not ok for them to voice dissent on your own website ? today was supposed to be a day of celebration			0
but now all i want to do is vent			0
how can my fellow fans of the @entity21 let their voices be heard ? should we just use the @entity108 page ? if we feel taken advantage of by the @entity21 may the 4th page , should we e-mail @entity111 ? of course , i thank you for the incredible , imaginative world you created with " @entity21 , " and for the happiness it 's brought me and all your fans			1
and i 'm sure i will get hours of enjoyment from the new dvds when i get them in september			0
but i did not and do not want them marketed to me on this day			0
may the 4th is a day that we created , and you , sir , are trying to steal from us			0
may the force be with you ! @entity125			1

holiday created by @entity21 fans plays on the phrase , " may the @entity130 "
@entity21 offered fans an *interactive* glimpse at the upcoming @entity19 *collection*
the official @entity21 online forums will shut down on june 3
fan @entity125 wonders : why do this when release is months away ?
