@entity0 , @entity1 -- the head of the railway whose runaway train devastated a small @entity1 town cast doubt on his engineer 's story wednesday as he arrived to face insults from survivors and harsh questions from reporters			1
@entity14 said the engineer has been suspended without pay and faces a criminal investigation by @entity19 authorities			1
he said the engineer reported to railroad managers that he set 11 hand brakes on the train cars before they broke away from their engines , but " i think it 's questionable whether he did			1
" " our general feeling is now that is not true , " said @entity14 , chairman of the @entity27			2
the engineer had worked for the @entity27 for " many years " and " had a completely clear safety record up until saturday , " @entity14 said			1

" they should put that guy in prison , " @entity82 said			1
" he 's a murderer ... he should be in prison			1
" @entity14 also was likely to face a chilly reception from mayor @entity89			0
@entity14 said he was trying to arrange meetings with the mayor , who would not tell reporters wednesday whether she would meet with him			0
@entity14 said he felt " personally , absolutely rotten " about the crash and said his railroad would " stand up to our responsibility			0
" as chairman , " i guess it 's my role to collect all this criticism , " he said			1
" we think we have plenty of responsibility , " he said			0
but whether the company bears " total responsibility " for the crash is " yet to be determined , " he added			0
the cars broke free from an @entity27 train as it was parked in the nearby town of @entity110 early saturday , plunging down a seven - mile incline into @entity0			1
firefighters in @entity110 had been called to put out a fire on the train before the cars broke away , and @entity14 said those firefighters may have shut down systems on the train 's five locomotives that contributed to the disaster			1
" we felt this probably had an important part to play in this tragedy , " he said			0
the fire department in @entity110 has rejected the notion			0
the engineer had parked the train and set hand brakes on all five engines and then checked into a hotel for the night			1
firefighters reported the blaze to a track maintenance man , who alerted the company to the incident , @entity14 said			0
the engines and nine other cars remained behind when the rest of the train broke away sometime later			1
they stopped a quarter of a mile away from their original parking spot in @entity110			0
police : evidence criminal act may have led to train crash investigators have asked fire crews to stop spraying down the wreckage to preserve as much of the remaining evidence as possible			1
@entity1 police spokesman @entity148 said wednesday , " we are no longer treating this as just an accident			1
" some of the evidence led investigators to believe a " criminal act " may have contributed to the train crash , @entity40 said tuesday			0
but @entity40 said authorities would lay no blame until the investigation shows exactly what happened			0
all businesses and factories in the affected region that are able were reopening wednesday morning , @entity158 said			0

and she thanked people from around the world who sent messages in the aftermath of the tragedy			0

quebec premier @entity190 said the provincial government would provide $ 25 million in emergency assistance immediately , with another $ 25 million to help with reconstruction efforts			0
" it 's small comfort , we know , " @entity190 said			2

tuesday , some 1,200 residents were allowed to return to their homes in the area			0
among them was @entity203 , who was eating lunch wednesday on his patio , a few blocks from the edge of the cordon			0
