-- @entity1 evidently had an awesome idea for a video game			0
but for some reason , he decided to do it as a movie first			1
i mean , it 's playing in movie theatres , so i guess you would have to call it a movie , albeit a sorry excuse for one			1
@entity1 has accrued some status with younger fans through his boldly stylized retakes on @entity18 's " @entity17 , " @entity20 's " 300 " and @entity21 's " @entity19			2
" so far , the raw material has been distinctive enough to camouflage @entity1 's increasingly threadbare bag of tricks : toggling between slow and fast motion , extreme close - ups and vertiginous long shots			2
he feeds back the kind of bastardized cinematic effects that comic books , pop videos and games took from film in the first place			0
it 's a high - impact , low - return aesthetic that promotes a tawdry gloss above character and story			1
talking of which , " @entity44 " is @entity1 's first stab at original material			1
and when i say " stab , " i mean he prods at it anxiously with a long blade , as if he wants to make sure it 's well and truly dead			2
if @entity1 has any call on the attention of a reasonably intelligent adult -- and on the evidence of this sleazy atrocity , that 's a mighty big " if " -- it 's as a pioneer of a post-narrative cinema , in which sensation and spectacle are paramount and situation is as fluid as a digital composite			2
here he conjures giants , zeppelins , and dragons all in the blink of an eye			0
but are these things enough when they come out of thin air ? clearly not , as " @entity44 " falls back repeatedly on the hoariest of melodramatic cliches			1
and so we 're treated to orphaned sisters abused and ( in one case ) murdered by an evil stepfather , who commits the surviving girl ( @entity75 ) to an asylum and bribes the warden to arrange a lobotomy			1
all this within the first three minutes			0
@entity79 -- known only as " @entity80 " -- contrives a mental escape route into an alternative reality , a bordello / burlesque house			1
but this , too , is a dangerous place controlled by rapacious men			0
she finds another rabbit hole in performing interpretative dance routines ( which we never see ) that transfix her captors , while projecting herself and her fellow inmates ­ -- including @entity93 and @entity94 -- into virtual reality adventure game scenarios : a @entity97 duel ; a @entity99 assignment behind enemy lines ; a ticking time bomb ; etc. , etc. ireporter : one out of five for " @entity44 " on some level , these episodes are configured as empowering fantasies ; the girls are pulling the triggers , after all			1
they 're also heavily fetishized affairs involving high heels , suspenders and plenty of skin			0
kudos to @entity1 ( who co-wrote the screenplay with @entity116 ) for letting his imagination run wild			0
it 's just a pity that imagination is so drastically circumscribed by the lurid " ho couture " culture of shoot - em - ups and soft porn			0
in the end , what can you say about a filmmaker who thinks nothing of laying a cover of the @entity132 ' " @entity131 " ( lyric : " some of them want to abuse you " ) over scenes of a man menacing two young girls ? or the @entity140 ' magisterial " @entity138 " over the committal scene ? that @entity1 is unafraid of overstatement ? or that he imagines an audience as lobotomized as his benumbed @entity80 ? see , the suckers here are the poor mugs who leave their dollars at the door			0
and for what ? a seedy , desaturated , overstimulated simulation of a real movie			1
schlock treatment for comatose gamers , and a bomb with a bright pink cherry on top .			0

" @entity44 " stars @entity75 , @entity93 , @entity94
@entity75 's character escapes into an alternative reality , a bordello / burlesque house
