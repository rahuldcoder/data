walking around the main cemetery in @entity1 , @entity2 , is like being in @entity3 for the dead			1
known as @entity6 , the cemetery holds huge mausoleums made of 30 - foot - high marble columns			2
many of the grave sites are enclosed by ornate buildings the size of small houses			2
these mausoleums have sitting rooms where family members come to remember their loved ones in true fiesta fashion			2
fresh flowers surround altars of expensive bottles of scotch and tequila			2
many tombs are air - conditioned , and some even have surround - sound piping in the favorite ballads of the deceased			2
but the most surreal part of the cemetery is not what 's above ground -- it 's the age of the victims buried below			1
many of the " residents " of these extravagant tombs are teenagers , and many seem to be just shy of their 25th birthday			2
@entity1 is the birthplace ( and for many , the resting place ) and base of the @entity40 , one of @entity2 's most powerful drug trafficking organizations			1
bloody battles between cartels and rivals have filled @entity6 with some of @entity2 's most infamous narco - traffickers			1
the opulence of their graves is a tribute to the lifestyle of @entity52 and the billions of dollars coming into @entity54 state from the lucrative trade			0
like modern - day pharaohs , these drug lords continue to bathe in excess even in the afterlife			1
in stark contrast to the @entity62 of @entity6 , an unimpressive headstone sits in a small cemetery a few miles away			0
it is the grave of @entity65 , a government spokesman , who had worked as a journalist for many years in @entity1 and covered some of the violence and corruption that engulfed the city			1
@entity65 's reporting , which touched on how the influence of narco - trafficking permeated every aspect of @entity1 life , contained none of the glamour or rewards of the narco trade itself			1
@entity65 drove a dilapidated car , in contrast to the legions of new hummers that were cruising downtown @entity1			0
he did n't have the fancy clothes or jewelry , and the tools of his trade were plastic pens , while the narcos carried bedazzled gold - plated ak - 47s			0
both in lifestyle and death - style , @entity65 lacks any of the glitter of his narco subjects , but there is one great commonality between them : the peril of their professions			0
since president @entity103 took office in 2006 and declared an open war on the drug cartels , nearly 50,000 people have been killed in suspected drug - related violence in @entity2 , according to @entity2 's government			1
many of the dead are narco - traffickers and low - level dealers			0
increasingly , civilians have been caught in the crossfire as cartels fight for the lucrative drug trading zones so critical to smuggling narcotics north			1
the violence in towns along the @entity121 - @entity2 border has been well documented			1
what is lesser known is the violence against journalists			1
targeted kidnappings , assassinations and threats have become the new normal for reporters who dare to cover drug trafficking and government corruption			1
since 2000 , more than 60 journalists have been killed in @entity2			1
not included in that figure are dozens more who have been kidnapped or have simply disappeared			1
this has made @entity2 one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists , and the trend is increasing			1
the impunity rate -- the rate at which those crimes go unsolved -- is 98 % , according to @entity2 's @entity144			1
in @entity2 , when it comes to a reporter 's death , it seems that many are literally getting away with murder			1
@entity151 is a journalist in @entity1 who knew @entity65 before @entity65 was killed by more than 30 high - caliber bullets in 2007			0
@entity151 said that when a journalist like @entity65 is killed , " nothing happens			0
that 's the saddest part , nothing happens			2
living in @entity54 is a threat , being a journalist is an additional threat			0
" @entity160 , @entity2 representative of the @entity161 , says that almost none of the murder cases of journalists are prosecuted			1
" it 's effective impunity , right			2
you just kill them and get away with it , and you solve your problems very easily , " he said			0
" and what does it cost to kill a journalist ? is it 500 bucks or is it 300 bucks , or is it two beers and the promise of promotion within the criminal organization ? it 's nothing			2
so if a journalist is causing you the slightest bit of problem , just get rid of them			0
" the threat to individual journalists has had larger consequences for the free media in @entity2			1
many organizations have simply abdicated reporting on the drug wars altogether			1
entire shootouts in broad daylight and murders go unreported			0
the frustration that newspapers experience has prompted an outcry			0
in 2010 , @entity197 , the most popular newspaper in @entity198 , published an unprecedented full - page editorial			0
" you are , at present , the de facto authorities in this city , " the newspaper 's letter to the cartels said , " because the legal institutions have not been able to keep our colleagues from dying			2
we do not want more deaths			0
we do not want more injuries or even more intimidation			0
it is impossible to exercise our role in these conditions			0
tell us , then , what do you expect of us as a medium ? " the response by many newspapers and tv stations has been to simply stop reporting on narco violence and corruption altogether			1
the vulnerability of traditional media has left a void that some social media have stepped up to fill			0
in @entity227 , @entity2 , a @entity226 feed warns people of attacks in real time			1
in @entity198 , @entity230 has picked up covering the violence that the mainstream media has left off			2
but even these alternative outlets have been targeted by the cartels			0
last year , a prominent blogger named @entity236 , who published under the pseudonym " @entity238 , " was found decapitated , with her head placed next to a keyboard			0
a note near the body , allegedly from members of the notorious @entity249 cartel , read , " ok @entity238 live on the social networks , i am @entity241 and i am here because of my reports and yours			2
" two other bodies were found hanging from a bridge , disemboweled , with an ominous letter addressed to @entity254			0
the violence against journalists in @entity2 has severely compromised the quality of information available to the public , both in @entity2 and the rest of the world			1
much of the international media reporting on the drug violence relies on local reporters			1
the media as a check on corruption , as a documentarian of daily life and as a purveyor of truth has been cowered			0
despite the incredible dangers of reporting , a few courageous people have continued to cover the violence and corruption			1
in 2011 , the @entity161 awarded @entity151 the @entity277 for his reporting in @entity1			2
when asked why he continues to write despite a grenade attack on his office , colleagues he has had to bury and repeated threats , he responded , " in my opinion , silence is a form of death , of complicity			0
i am not dead , i 'm alive , i 'm writing these stories			0
i do n't want the day to come where my children will be able to say , ' you were a journalist and this was happening in @entity1 and you stayed quiet			0
' no one will be able to tell me , ' you stayed quiet			0

increasingly , civilians have been caught in the crossfire of @entity2 's cartel violence
@entity2 is also one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists
in @entity2 , many organizations have simply quit reporting on the drug wars altogether
