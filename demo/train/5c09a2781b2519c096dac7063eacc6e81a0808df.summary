whew , it 's all over , folks -- the twin crises of government shutdown and national default countdown			1
this one was n't easy			0
and we 'll be talking about it for a while			0
that 's just one of the four lessons we take away from this calamity in our capital			2
a walk in the park we love our parks			2
boy , do we love our national parks			1
that was evident in a public outcry , on social media and elsewhere			0
is n't it nice that in our deprivation , we found something to appreciate ? the shuttered national parks did n't stop some visitors from trying to sneak onto back roads or lookout points to steal a quiet view of nature			1
however , armed park rangers who were mandated to work during the shutdown thwarted many motorists by swinging the road gates closed			2
9 things we missed during the shutdown the @entity37 is n't so grand it 's a great thing to have conservatives and liberals giving us different viewpoints on how to run the country , but the @entity37 -- the party of president @entity43 -- now seems a house divided			1
@entity45 wo n't rule out another shutdown @entity47 : further shutdowns ' off the table ' can the @entity37 heal an internal rift between establishment conservatives and the new conservatives of the tea party ? for the moment , the @entity37 are cited as the top cause for the shutdown , evidenced by a @entity58 / @entity57 poll showing the @entity37 is the biggest target of @entity61 anger , with 63 % of respondents venting their ire at them			1
democrats fared only slightly better , however , with 58 % expressing anger at them , too			0
and 53 % were angry at president @entity66			0
winners and losers from the shutdown crisis economic damage for a country fresh out of a great recession , the 16 - day shutdown was costly : it took $ 24 billion out of the economy , @entity74 's says			1
as a result , the @entity61 will grow 2.4 % -- instead of 3 % -- this quarter , meaning there wo n't be as many new jobs that many @entity61 families desperately need in the post-recession era			1
a sequel as difficult as this drama was , there will be a @entity85 the @entity87 horror genre does n't have anything over @entity89			1
the government is funded until january 15 -- meaning americans will be forced to witness another round of @entity94 - @entity37 budget negotiations			0
it gets better , or worse , depending on your viewpoint : the debt ceiling will have to be revisited , too , by february 7			0
all this makes some economists worry that @entity61 will now be afraid to invest , create jobs , and go shopping this holiday season			2
perhaps @entity102 , managing director of @entity74 's rating service , put it best : " we think that we 'll be back here in january debating the same issues , " @entity105 said			2
" this is , i fear , a permanent feature of our budgetary process			0
" playing nice : budget talks may start with an extra-friendly tone			0

amid our deprivations during the shutdown , we appreciate our national parks
the party of @entity43 seems to be a house divided
ouch , the @entity61 economy lost $ 24 billion
like a @entity87 horror film , there 's going to be a sequel
