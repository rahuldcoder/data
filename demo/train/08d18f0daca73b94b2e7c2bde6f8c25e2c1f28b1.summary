he saw it first - hand on a reporting trip in @entity4 province -- scores of village children going to school hungry			0
but @entity7 refused to stand by and watch			0
so in 2011 , he left journalism and started his own private charity to provide free meals for @entity12 's village children			1
and in three years , his " @entity14 " campaign has fed a total of 92,000 kids across 23 @entity12 provinces			2
" the government wo n't be able to solve all our problems , " @entity7 tells @entity18			0
" we must give up this unrealistic idea and take the initiative ourselves			0
" @entity12 may be a single - party state run from the very top			1
but grassroots activism has been bubbling up from beneath , bringing about much needed social support and change			0
officially , @entity12 has around half a million registered @entity29 , most with government connections			2
as for the number of unregistered independent ngos ? according to @entity36 , @entity35 's @entity34 , it 's a figure close to some two million			0
" these are tiny little groups of people all over the country working on trying to improve the lives of people living in those areas -- whether it 's on labor issues , women 's rights or the environment			2
" force for change for more than two decades , @entity49 has been an advocate for workers ' rights in @entity12			2
he first gained international attention during 1989 @entity54 protests when , as a railway worker , he helped set up @entity12 's first independent trade union			1
after the crackdown , he continued his advocacy work in @entity59 as the founder and director of the @entity62			0
@entity49 says @entity12 's national trade union has failed to represent the needs of the nation 's workers : " the official union always sees itself as , unfortunately , government officials			1
they do n't see themselves as workers ' representatives			0
" so the workers of @entity12 have no choice but be their own force for change in the country , striking for better wages and launching civil action for just compensation			1
and with the rise of social media in @entity12 , the country 's civil society is more connected and better resourced than ever before -- bringing people in need together , including @entity12 's once isolated coal miners suffering from deadly lung diseases			1
" there are a hundred thousand silicosis victims who are supposed to die in the cold and be silent , but now they 're making their voices heard , " @entity49 tells me			0
" they 're going to die soon , yes			0
but their voices are brought together on a platform through social media			1
it brings people out from isolation			0
" social power the power and reach of social media has played a major role in developing a civil society in @entity12			1
it has also unsettled the @entity108 , which operates an internet censorship regime that filters content and frequently takes down posts critical of party rule			1
but it 's also forced @entity113 to take part in the online exchange			2
" social media is definitely a game changer to @entity12 , " says @entity116 , a @entity12 social media researcher and internet freedom activist			1
" the government and the civil society , they all participate in these platforms as their voice channels			1
and the government has to follow the game rules of social media , not their traditional rules			1
" with state - run media channels like the @entity132 or @entity133 actively managing social media accounts , an online civil society has forced the party to embrace a more interactive platform			1
but can it lead to real world political change ? political tension @entity36 , who has had more than 20 years of experience covering @entity12 , believes civil society may very well play a critical role in changing @entity12 's political landscape			1
" what we might see now compared with 25 years ago during @entity54 , is that the cells of organizations are much more quickly formed together , " says @entity36 , who was in @entity113 to cover the protests in 1989			2
" it would be much more difficult for the government to control information , to stop people organizing , and to stop the flow of information in these kind of critical events			0
" @entity113 is aware of the growing strength of the country 's civil society , and is taking action to rein them in and take control			1
" the government itself is beginning to try and bring more of these small hitherto unregistered groups into the official fold -- registering them , getting to know them , " says @entity36			0
" it hopes , presumably , to get to control them better			0
" and yet the blessing of the government has proved essential for many non-governmental organizations in @entity12			2
" government support is also very important to us , " says " @entity14 " campaigner @entity7			0
" they have the control over a lot of resources , and they decide whether or not we can access the schools			0
" that 's people power in the @entity12 .			2

a civil society is forming under single - party rule in @entity12
*widespread* use of social media means @entity12 's civil society is more connected and better resourced than before
@entity113 is aware of growing strength of the country 's civil society and is taking action to rein it in
