-- @entity1 made short work of opponents @entity4 as the @entity6 giants made it a miserable @entity8 debut for their less illustrious neighbors with a 3 - 0 win on saturday			1
elsewhere , @entity11 continued their good form from last season with a 2 - 1 win over @entity15			1
@entity16 struggled in their first game of the season , going down 2 - 1 to @entity19 despite taking the lead in the first half			1
@entity22 was handed his debut for @entity1 , and tasked with replacing the ill @entity24 , with @entity26 defender @entity25 also making his first start in defence			1
it was one of @entity1 's regulars who opened the scoring , however , with @entity32 lashing the ball into the net from close range after a header from debutant @entity25			1
@entity1 dominated throughout and doubled their lead in the 59th minute when @entity39 striker @entity38 -- signed in the summer from @entity40 -- headed his first goal of the season past goalkeeper @entity43			1
@entity45 winger got his reward for a fine performance when he added a third in the 78th minute			2
@entity49 's cross took a wicked deflection off @entity52 's defender @entity51 and looped over the unfortunate @entity43 's head before settling in the back of the net			0
" we were very composed , smart and clever too , " @entity1 coach @entity56 told the club 's website			1
" naturally , it 's normal that you need a little time to get going			0
we were playing a promoted team who were still euphoric after what they achieved , and that 's never easy			0
" " we 're aiming very high this season , the team is fired up and extremely motivated , and we 're getting through a lot of good work , so i 'm not surprised by today 's result			0
" @entity72 , @entity52 coach , admitted that getting a result at @entity1 is " hard " if they take the lead			1
" once you fall behind to @entity1 it 's always hard			1
if you give them space just for an instant , they 'll free up @entity49 with a first - time pass , and suddenly it 's 2 - 0 , " he told the @entity1 website			1
@entity86 recovered from their mid week defeat in the @entity90 qualifiers to claim an opening win over @entity15			1
@entity11 enjoyed large spells of possession , but could n't make the breakthrough			1
in the 33rd minute , @entity95 delivered a dangerous free kick into the box that tall striker @entity98 was able to head into the net to open the scoring			0
the goal did n't ignite the game , with neither side creating any clear opportunities			0
however , in the 66 minute @entity11 goalkeeper @entity105 struggled to hold a shot from @entity107 and @entity108 pounced to prod the ball home			2
the game looked to be heading for a draw when @entity95 stepped up to strike another free kick			0
this time the @entity114 curled the ball into the top corner to give his team all three points			2
@entity16 suffered a poor start to life under new full time manager @entity122			2
things looked to be going well for the former @entity125 man , with @entity126 giving @entity16 the lead on the half hour mark			2
@entity126 did well to pounce when @entity129 spilled a shot from @entity131			0
@entity19 , returning to @entity133 's top league after a year in @entity134 , rallied well and deserved their equalizer in the 57th minute			2
@entity137 leveled the score when he shot home after good work from @entity141			0
after the equalizer the game opened up as the two teams went for a winner			0
@entity16 went close , and should have taken the lead when @entity147 fired wide			2
@entity19 's @entity148 finally settled it in the 82nd minute when he perfectly connected with a cross from @entity150 to fire an unstoppable header into the @entity16 net			1
@entity153 got their season of to a good start in a poor game against @entity158			1
@entity159 scored the only goal of the game in the 56th minute , poking home the rebound from @entity165 's header on to the bar			0
@entity169 should have taken a point for the @entity171 in the final minute , but his header somehow hit the bar when the back of the net seemed simpler			0
@entity176 have signed 18 players over the summer , but only gave debuts to five of them in their starting eleven			0
the newly promoted side looked the more impressive of the two teams , and a brace from @entity182 -- who arrived from @entity52 this summer -- ensured they took their first points of the season			2
both @entity185 and @entity186 enjoyed wins in the @entity188 last weekend , but neither could take the three points as the @entity8 got under way			1
the two sides were evenly matched , but it was @entity195 's new signing @entity196 that made the breakthrough in the 48th minute			0
@entity186 attacked from the restart , and eventually got the equalizer in the 65th minute when @entity200 was fouled in the box			0
the lively @entity202 stepped up to convert the spot kick .			0

@entity1 enjoy opening day win in @entity8
@entity11 steal three points
@entity16 fall to new boys @entity19
