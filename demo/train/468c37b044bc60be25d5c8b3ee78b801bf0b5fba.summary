-- @entity1 grabs the producer of a television network and smacks the lanky young man , cursing angrily			0
he throws studio furniture at the camera crew			0
then he turns his attention to the beautiful female anchor			0
before she can duck , he slaps her across the face , leaving her curled up in a corner of the room			0
@entity1 is a famous actor in @entity14 , but this is not a skit			1
he was victimized by a provocative new @entity14 television show called " @entity18 , " or @entity19			1
on the program , @entity14 actress @entity20 talks with celebrities under the pretense that the interview is for an @entity27 - speaking @entity26 network			1
after an often tense dialogue on @entity14 - @entity31 relations , the show crew dupes the interviewee into thinking they are actually on an @entity31 tv station and begin provoking and taunting the subject			1
reactions have included anti-israeli slurs , desperate cries to leave and , as in @entity1 's case , physical assault			1
" this is a candid - camera program , but it is different than any other candid - camera shows that can be shallow , " said @entity40 , the show 's creator			1
" it explores a deep subject matter , and it covers an important gut - level issue			1
the issue is , of course , @entity14 's relationship with @entity31			1
" in one episode , panicked actress @entity51 spends nearly four minutes struggling to push away four men who are blocking the exit door and yelling " we are @entity31 " at her			2
" i swear to @entity56 i want to leave ! let me leave ! " @entity51 whimpers as she breaks down into tears			0
finally the crew shouts , " you are on ' @entity18			0
give her a big round of applause ! " @entity51 continues to cry for a few moments			0
still shocked and petrified , she mutters , " i just got scared they would kidnap me			0
" in another episode , actress @entity67 says all @entity31 are " real liars			2
" " they keep whining all the time about the holocaust or whatever it 's called , " she says			0
" with all the @entity72 that you have killed , you are still whining about the @entity70 and its lousy figures ? " the heated rhetoric and violent assaults on the program have prompted a firestorm of international criticism and allegations of @entity81			0
and with the election of @entity14 president @entity85 after more than a year of political upheaval , the show 's popularity has raised concern about the stability of @entity14 's three - decade - old peace accord with @entity31			1
" the program ' @entity18 ' results in inciting public opinion against peace , " @entity90 , spokesman to the @entity92 media in the @entity31 prime minister 's office , remarked on @entity94			1
" from our perspective , peace is fundamental and vindictive programs like this will not be broadcast in @entity31			2
" the show also appears to be no laughing matter for the @entity31 press , with critical headlines ranging from " audience applauds violent anti-semitism on @entity110 " ( @entity111 ) to " reality show reveals ingrained @entity14 hatred for @entity31 " ( @entity114 )			1
but @entity40 said " there is a difference between expressing hate for @entity31 and its politics and expressing hate for the @entity121 people			2
" he said celebrities were happy to give consent so their footage could be aired on the show			2
" once the guests found out it was prank , they really loved the idea and enjoyed the show and agreed to be on it , " he said			2
" we felt there was an overwhelming sense of patriotism and pride in standing up for @entity14 and the @entity92			2
" all of the episodes were taped before the show became one of the top five @entity140 programs on @entity14 television station @entity141			1
the show also boasts more than four million @entity144 viewers , and the show 's producers say the success should n't be overshadowed by the punches and the insults			1
" we have produced 95 episodes , and in only three did the personalities attack the crew , " @entity40 said			0
" the normal reaction is for people to reject the dialogue because they were duped			0
... others refused to complete the interview because it was on an @entity31 tv station and they boycott all relations with @entity31 , which is their right			1
" " the program intends to deliver a message , and i believe the reaction by @entity31 is very natural , " said @entity162 , chairman of the show 's production company			1
" a majority of @entity14 will boycott any interaction with @entity31 after its historical oppression of the @entity92 people			1
we are not against , however , the peace treaty with @entity31			2
we are against the apartheid			0
" in post-revolution @entity14 , the end to the censorship of the @entity178 regime has fueled a wave of original new content set to tackle taboo issues from sexual harassment to @entity184			0
but it also means the media community is less inclined to curb what might be offensive			0
" in @entity189 and @entity190 , there is no censorship on cinema or tv			0
no topic is off - limits , " said @entity194			0
" so why are people against our show ? the show is an idea , and it is freedom of expression , and our guests also have freedom of expression to say what they believe			0

a popular television show in @entity14 plays pranks on *unwitting* celebrities
they are asked about their views on @entity31 and then told they are on @entity31 tv
some have responded with anti-israeli slurs and violence before being told it is a prank
show 's creator : the show " covers an important gut - level issue "
