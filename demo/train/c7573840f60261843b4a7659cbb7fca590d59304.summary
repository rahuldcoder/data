-- every year , sneeze sufferers swear : " this is the worst allergy season ever			0
" and they 're right			0
" @entity10 levels are increasing , pollen seasons are getting longer , and more people are developing allergies , " says @entity5 , @entity6 , chairwoman of the aerobiology committee for the @entity8			1
in fact , this year 's fall allergies ( affecting at least 12 million @entity16 ) will most likely last up to 27 days longer than average in the northernmost parts of @entity20 , going even into november in some spots , a new study suggests			1
while spring and fall allergies cause the same symptoms ( sneezing , itchy eyes , and runny nose ) , their triggers are different			1
@entity28 allergies , which run from february to late july , are brought on by pollen from trees , grasses , and weeds			1
fall allergies go from mid-august through the first autumn frost , and are chiefly set off by pollen from the ragweed plant , mold , and dust mites			1
@entity0 : 20 ways to stop allergies read on to learn what 's making both seasons so unbearable — and the best ways to survive them			2
the seasons are longer spring allergies now start sooner and fall allergies end later , thanks to global warming , says @entity50 , @entity51 , director of the @entity52 of @entity53			1
we 're using more and more carbon - based fuels , generating greenhouse gases ( such as carbon dioxide ) that trap heat from the sun in our atmosphere			1
this makes temperatures rise , prompting plants and trees to flower — and release pollen — earlier each spring ; in the fall , they delay the death of ragweed plants from frost , extending the pollen season , @entity5 explains			1
end result : " fall " allergies may go practically into winter			1
@entity0 : the worst plants for your allergies there 's more pollen than ever higher amounts of carbon dioxide not only kick - start pollen production , they also boost the amount of pollen each plant generates , too -- especially in urban areas , where the gas is more plentiful			1
to add insult to injury , @entity88 is making pollen more potent , too			2
" there 's more allergen now in each grain than there used to be , " @entity50 says			0
and pollen is n't the only allergen on the rise			2
increasingly balmy temperatures mean more moisture in the air , which creates mold			0
" the higher temperatures and gas may increase not just the growth of mold but also its spore production — which is how it distributes allergens — both indoors and out , " @entity50 says			2
@entity0 : protect your home and family from dangerous mold and mildew more people are developing allergies the number of @entity16 with allergies is two to five times higher now than it was about 30 years ago , according to surveys from the @entity120			1
genes play a role in your susceptibility , but the blooming allergy boom is most likely due to the longer , more intense pollen seasons — plus these expert - supported theories : we 're too clean			2
now that we 're exposed to less dirt and bacteria ( thanks in part to our obsession with antibacterial everything ) , and have fewer scourges like polio and parasites to fight , our immune systems are quicker to overreact to otherwise harmless substances like pollen , says @entity5			2
at the same time , our environment is too dirty : studies show that pollution ( such as exhaust fumes ) can trigger allergic flare - ups			0
our modern diet is hurting us			0
today 's processed , preserved foods lack the tough fibers of the plants and grains our ancestors feasted on , throwing off the delicate balance of bacteria in our guts and setting us up for allergic sensitivity , says @entity156 professor of internal medicine @entity157 , @entity6			0
studies suggest , too , that as use of antibiotics — which also disrupt bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract — has surged , so have allergies			0
@entity0 : your secret allergy triggers revealed the good news : even if we 're now more prone to sniffling , sneezing , and itchy eyes , " there are many more treatment options on the market now , " says @entity5			0
" the current medications are so much better than they used to be			0
" a potent mix of non-sedating antihistamines , steroid sprays , and eyedrops help target today 's stepped - up symptoms			0
and in the end , simply getting back to nature — by skipping the hand sanitizer from time to time and eating whole , fresh foods — may just be a crucial defense against , well , nature			0
