the posthumous collection , " lioness : @entity16 , " features 12 tracks ; unreleased songs and alternative versions of some of her hits			1
@entity2 's longtime producers @entity17 and @entity19 trawled through hours of recordings to compile the album , which also includes " @entity22 , " her duet with crooner @entity24			1
the " rehab " and " @entity31 " songstress died in july at the age of 27 , following a long and well - documented battle with drink and drugs			2
an inquest ruled she died of alcohol poisoning , with a blood - alcohol level more than five times the drink - drive limit			2
review : @entity2 's " lioness " is bittersweet @entity2 's mother @entity38 welcomed news of the album 's success in a statement on @entity43 , saying it was " amazing news			1
" " [ it ] just goes to show what she still means to people ... i 'm so proud of my daughter and so happy that she is still touching people			0
she 's forever in my heart			0
" @entity52 , spokesman for music retailer @entity53 , said " lioness " had long been tipped as a big hit , following a massive upsurge in demand for @entity2 's music following her death			1
" we fully expected it to go straight in at @entity62 , but to do so achieving such a level of sales is truly remarkable and shows how @entity2 's music continues to touch so many people , " he said			1

@entity75 , associate editor of music magazine " q " said such posthumous releases were risky , but could offer new windows into an artist 's talent			0
" it 's unlikely you 'll ever know what the artist in question thought of it and whether they are happy for the public to hear it as they 're not finished , " he told @entity1			0
" however these records do shed often a different light on an artist 's creative process so can be of merit artistically			0
" and in the case where a singer has passed away suddenly , as with @entity2 , they give fans an opportunity to hear the best versions of what 's left behind rather than poor quality bootlegs or studio leaks			2
