-- on the night the @entity3 's decision broke , a friend sent me an email : " something was clearly broken in the @entity9 community long before @entity6 died			1
time and energy needs to be spent on figuring out what went wrong and how you begin again to build trust -- because it will have to be rebuilt			1
justice to be credible and accepted has to have trust as its foundation			1
@entity9 does not stand alone			1
every day , in cities and towns across @entity22 , african - americans experience weighted scales of justice			1
this reality is an accepted part of life for too many			2
it 's also important to realize that having problems based on race does not mean we 've backslid			1
president @entity33 is right when he says race relations in this nation are improving , and are much better than in years past			1
we have traveled a long , hard road to a better @entity22			1
it is an ongoing journey requiring constant vigilance			0
when i was growing up , our nation was partitioned : blacks were segregated by law in the @entity43 and largely by custom in the @entity45 , though it too had segregation laws			1
our best universities had quota systems			0
many white communities had real estate covenants to keep nonwhites out			0
segregationist gov. @entity52 won @entity53 and @entity54 -- not just the @entity43 -- in his bid for the @entity57 's presidential nomination			0
it was a crime in the @entity43 for blacks and white to sit together on a bus			1
@entity45 , it was prohibited for blacks and whites to marry			2
despite this wide racial gulf , most @entity22 showed a deep commitment to fairness			1
this contrasted and contested sharply with sanctioned -- sometimes officially , sometimes unofficially -- vigilante hangings and bombings , fire hoses , police dogs , and congressional filibusters			0
as the civil rights struggle progressed , @entity22 responded to the justice of the cause , shedding layers of the crusty armor that shielded the white majority from contact with its large black minority			1
it feels so much better to be on good terms with one another			0
i remember when sen. @entity87 of @entity88 , a vigorous opponent of civil rights legislation , voted for an extension of the @entity91 in 1983			0
" i did n't want to go back to all the days of misunderstanding , " he said afterward			2
" i did n't want to turn around and go back , " he said			2
we also know @entity22 is n't @entity94			1
when cities burn in the night , parents weep in silent anguish , thousands march in protest , and a @entity9 prosecutor willingly undercuts his own case , we have a distance to travel			1
today , we need a national commission on justice			1
one that is more than a fact - finding commission			2
one whose purpose is reconciliation			0
this one should be modeled after @entity111 's @entity110 , chaired by @entity112			0
there was an emphasis in that commission on reconciliation			2
there was a marked effort to forgive			0
@entity112 wrote , " when i talk of forgiveness i mean the belief that you can come out the other side ... a better person than the one being consumed by anger and hatred			2
" remaining in that state locks you in a state of victimhood , making you almost dependent on the perpetrator			0
if you can find it in yourself to forgive then you are no longer chained to the perpetrator			0
" @entity112 added a " but			0
" " but the process of forgiveness also requires acknowledgment on the part of the perpetrator that they have committed an offense			2
" the grand jury system , not just in @entity9 , but nationwide , needs a hard look			1
millions feel that officers who are trigger - happy are handed a license to shoot -- based not on facts , but on stereotypes the officers carry			0
millions feel stereotypes explain why a lone 12 - year - old with a toy gun was instantly , and fatally shot in daylight by @entity154 police , but why a white mass - murderer , shooting in a darkened theater , was apprehended unharmed			0
citizen grievances must be gathered , studied and addressed			0
acknowledgment of wrongdoing , where appropriate , must be made			0
but we can not ignore this problem , or pretend it does n't exist			1
i share the pain of the @entity22 who wrote these tweets : from @entity168 " if you 're not angry , you 're not paying attention			1
" and @entity171 @ @entity172 who tweeted , " my 7 year old son just said : " do n't worry mom			2
if we want to live , we just have to stay home "			0
i 'm turning off my tv			0
" let us start by addressing these issues , work together to find ways to rebuild trust between citizens and those who are paid to protect us from violence .			2

@entity186 : after @entity9 decision , trust among black community has to be rebuilt
she says justice system often *unfair* to blacks . it does n't mean @entity22 backslid in gains on race
she says @entity22 want fairness . we need national commission on justice
@entity186 : changes , forgiveness must come . but we can not pretend problem does n't exist
