-- although i do n't plan to change my name when i get hitched this summer , i respect and appreciate every woman 's right to choose what 's best for her			2
i reject the notion some have expressed that when a woman takes her husband 's last name she 's giving up her identity			0
rules still remain about the proper way to address invitations to women depending on their marital status			0
but then i had an interesting conversation with my mother recently that added a whole new layer to this name and identity dichotomy			0
i 've been working on wedding invitations and i 'm in the middle of finalizing a guest list and collecting addresses , so i shot my mom an email to make sure i had the most current addresses of our family members , and i also asked how i should formally address certain people on the envelopes			2
i figured that my mother and grandmother , being total old - school traditionalists , would prefer to be addressed with their husbands as mr. and mrs. @entity39 , but i was n't sure about everyone else			1
how , for example , should i address my aunt who 's divorced but retained her married name ? the @entity0 : what 's in a name ? my mother 's reply sort of shocked me			1
as i expected , she expressed her desire to be addressed as mrs. @entity49 , but said that etiquette dictated that all married women who share their husband 's last name be addressed as such , and that divorced women who retain their married names , like my aunt , should be addressed as mrs. -- not ms. , as i assumed -- @entity58			1
the @entity0 : 15 tips for a budget wedding most surprising to me , my mother said that even when a card is sent just to her , like a birthday card or @entity64 card , she prefers to be addressed as mrs. @entity66 's @entity65 and not , as i 'd assume , @entity68 ! " your grandmother prefers that as well , " she said , " we 've talked about it			1
" she says that addressing a woman as @entity74 would imply that she 's divorced , and a card addressed without a title at all is just plain " impolite			1
" " @entity79 the etiquette rules if you do n't believe me , " she said			0
well , i did @entity79 the rules ; i even took the bible of social rules , " @entity84 ( 16th edition ) " down off the shelf , and was astonished to find that my mom is pretty much correct			0
the book and almost every link i found said it was proper etiquette to address the envelope of a married couple as mr. and mrs. @entity93 without any regard to the woman 's first name at all			1
the @entity0 : why are weddings getting weirder in my brief search i found just one exception , which expressed clearly : " either use both first names when addressing a married couple or no first names at all			0
avoid the mr. and mrs. @entity103			0
( it is old fashioned and usually makes the wife feel owned by her husband )			0
" using no first names on mail addressed to married couples is the tradition i 've adopted as an adult , never realizing that both my mother and grandmother find it disrespectful because it 's not in keeping with traditional rules of etiquette			2
my mother says the etiquette rule that trumps all others when it comes to names is to call a person what he or she wishes to be called , which is a rule that 's surely timeless			2
the @entity0 : can you wear white to someone else 's wedding ? but what about in situations when one does n't know how a person wishes to be addressed and it 's impractical to ask ( like when you have to address 100 wedding invitations , for example ) ? if we 're to fall back on the general rules of etiquette , is n't it time that those rules reflect modern culture and not the traditions of the 1950s or earlier ? @entity145 all rights reserved			1
