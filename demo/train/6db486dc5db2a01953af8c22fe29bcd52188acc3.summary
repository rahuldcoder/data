-- comedian / actor @entity1 has departed " @entity5 " after eight seasons , but it 's not like he 's strapped for work			1
this friday , @entity1 will be seen prominently in the raunchy summer comedy " the @entity7 " opposite @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
the film comes from @entity1 's wife , writer / director @entity13 , so he 's particularly close to this project			1
later this summer , he 'll reprise his role as the voice of @entity18 in " @entity19			1
" @entity0 spoke with @entity1 about his @entity21 nomination , why he 's moving back to @entity22 and his take on humor 's long shelf life			1
@entity0 : " the @entity7 " is set in the early ' 90s , an era that a lot of people these days feel nostalgic about			1
what 's funny to you about this time period ? @entity1 : i do n't really know what 's funny about it			1
everything is so tech now ; everyone is so connected that way			2
it 's interesting in this movie that i have to tell @entity8 's character something , and i have to go to her house			1
which you would never do now			2
the whole movie would be done in two seconds now			1
it was the last time when things were in that ' 50s vein			2
now , if i leave my cell phone at the house , i assume my house is on fire			2
@entity0 : you play a slacker pool manager , but you yourself are not a slacker			2
did you ever go through a stoner phase ? @entity1 : no , i never did			1
i actually do n't smoke pot that much			2
i 've never been a big pot smoker			2
and when i do smoke pot , friends always say , " i feel like i 'm smoking pot with my dad			2
" i was always the designated driver ; i never drank that much			2
not out of some moral thing			2
it 's that i was n't that interested in that			1
i was more of the drinking coffee at the coffee shop crowd			2
oddly enough , i was n't a very good student			2
i did n't apply myself that well			2
i was n't good at doing things i was n't interested in			2
i used to think i was just slow , and a nice teacher said , " oh , you 're actually really smart , you do n't give a s * * * about anything			2
" @entity0 : along with playing the lead , you 're also billed as a producer			2
are you looking to do more behind - the - scenes work in the future , like , say , @entity81 does ? @entity1 : yeah			1
i 'd love to direct a movie			1
that 's initially what i wanted to do			1
acting was never something on my radar			2
i just did it as a fun extension of wanting to direct			1
i thought i should act to know what actors go through			2
i realized the acting thing really took			0
) @entity0 : last week , the @entity21 nominations came out , and it was the first time a male " @entity5 " cast member has been nominated twice for " @entity97			1
" have you been in a " comedy sweet spot " the last few years , the way a basketball player might get hot shooting three pointers ? @entity1 : i do n't know if it 's that or ... i do n't know			1
i try not to think about it too much , or i 'll go crazy			1
i used to always think that there was a shelf life on being funny			0
but i work with ( " @entity109 " creators ) @entity110 ( @entity111 ) and @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , and their show is in its 16th season , and every season is funnier			0
they figure out new things to do			0
@entity121 , when he comes by ( " @entity5 " ) , he 's still the funniest human being on the planet			1
@entity124 still makes me laugh			0
all these people i liked growing up are still making me laugh			0
i try not to think about it too much in terms of myself			0
@entity0 : that 's probably good			1
you need to get some sleep			0
@entity1 : it 's not very healthy to think about yourself on those terms			1
oddly enough , i have really bad stage fright -- getting up in front of people			0
and i made a living going on live television			0
@entity0 : would you be paranoid about the reactions after , or was it more of a " once it 's done , it 's done " ? @entity1 : i 'd be done with it			1
i 've done sketches on the show -- i do n't think i 've ever finished anything and thought , " oh , that was great			0
" i 'm always like " uhhhh ... why did n't i do this ? " it 's like a trap that i try to wiggle out of on - air			1
i prepare stuff so compulsively			0
i 'm constantly rereading the sketch , going over it			0
so i know it so well , and if the slightest thing does n't get a laugh , it used to throw me			0
toward my last couple seasons on the show , i 'd purposely do something i 've never done before			0
not so much say things but give a different look or pause differently			0
something that my brain would say " oh , you screwed up , " and suddenly i would relax			0
every saturday morning , i 'd wake up , and i 'd immediately start pacing			0
i could not make my body stop moving			0
i thought if i stopped moving , it would sink in that i have to go on live television tonight			0
@entity0 : it seems like leaving " @entity5 " might be good for your health			1
@entity1 : yeah , good for my mental health			1
no , i say all this , but in the moment , when it 's happening , it 's actually fun			1
especially if people are laughing			0
@entity0 : what was the conversation with @entity177 like ? how does someone resign from this iconic show ? @entity1 : i went into his office in february , and i think he knew that i was going to move to @entity22			1
that 's what it was really about			1
we got a family , and i want a backyard			0
that 's how it started			1
it was really just excruciating small talk and then getting into the issue of the leaving			0
generally , @entity177 said , " i totally get it , you have a family			0
i would love it if you stayed , but i get it			0
" around may , i said i wanted to announce it , and that 's how it went			1
people will say that they cried			0
i thought i was going to pass out			0
when it was addressed and happened , it felt like a weight had been put on my shoulder or a weight had been lifted			0
all i know is that the room started tilting a bit			0
it was a physical reaction to saying the words " i 'm leaving			0
i did n't have a career			0
i worked as an editor on " iron chef : @entity215 " before " snl			1
" it 's the reason people know me			1
@entity0 : that 's quite a jump , from " iron chef : @entity215 " to " snl			1
" @entity1 : it was scary			1
for four years , i was waiting for them to figure out they made a giant mistake			0
i still ca n't really believe it			0
@entity0 : @entity225 has certainly entered the hall of fame of " @entity5 " characters			1
was he your favorite ? @entity1 : he was one of my favorites			1
@entity231 , the reporter who was a real * * * * head , i loved playing him			0
what i liked about doing @entity225 is that you could play it kind of subtle			0
it was right at the camera .			0

@entity1 has a busy summer after his exit from " @entity5 "
he 'll star in " @entity243 " and " @entity19 "
the star says he 's come a long way from his days editing " iron chef : @entity215 "
he hopes he 'll soon direct a movie
