-- many people consider @entity2 to be a 21st century @entity3			0
@entity4 killed @entity2 as the 17 - year - old @entity5 returned home after buying skittles and iced tea			1
the killing has generated sadness , anger and frustration both because the innocent and inoffensive victim may have been targeted only because of his race , and because the admitted shooter was not arrested			0
after weeks of suspense , @entity17 special prosecutor @entity16 has ordered @entity4 arrested and charged him with second - degree murder			1
this development shows several positive things about the criminal justice system			0
first , it makes clear that even under @entity17 's liberal self - defense laws , an implausible or unsubstantiated claim of self - defense does not constitute a " get out of jail free " card			1
@entity17 's " stand your ground " law protects , some say over-protects , the right of self - defense			1
but judges and juries still have the power to evaluate the truth of self - defense claims , and defendants will be convicted of homicide if the prosecution can prove that killings were outside the law			1
in addition , at a press conference announcing the charge , @entity47 emphasized that the charges were based on careful investigation and evaluation of the facts , not on " pressure or petition			2
" it is wonderful that the rallies , marches and protests brought attention to a case that otherwise might have gone unnoticed			2
but it would be disastrous for society if popular pressure alone could induce prosecutors to charge people with crimes			0
some aspects of how the case will proceed are clear			0
first , while the prosecution was unconvinced by @entity4 's self - defense claim , he is still entitled to present it to the jury at trial			1
if they accept it , of course , he will be acquitted			0
in addition , although @entity4 is charged with second - degree murder , even if the jury rejects the self - defense claim and believes the killing was homicide , they may choose to convict of a " lesser included offense " such as manslaughter			1
manslaughter is still a serious felony , although it carries a lower penalty than murder			0
it is also important to note the stringency of the requirements for a second - degree murder charge			1
the prosecution must prove that a defendant had " a depraved mind " and acted " without regard for human life			0
" the killing must be motivated by " ill will , hatred , spite , or an evil intent			0
" the defense is likely to argue that even if @entity4 made a misjudgment or mistake , as a neighborhood watch volunteer , he had none of these bad motives			1
he could claim that no one bent on murder would , as he did , call the police in advance			0
the lesser charge of manslaughter requires a killing through " act , procurement or culpable negligence " which can be established with less evidence of bad motive			1
under a particular set of facts it could be that both @entity2 and @entity4 reasonably believed they were being confronted by unlawful violence from the other , and therefore that both thought they had to use force to defend themselves			2
if the jury found that to be the case , under @entity17 law , @entity4 would be acquitted			1
it is impossible to say which of these scenarios is most likely			0
the prosecutor would not and could not have filed charges if she believed that @entity2 simply attacked @entity4 , who fired because he reasonably feared for his own life			2
beyond that , however , the prosecutor deliberately ( and properly , under applicable ethical rules ) declined to reveal what facts the investigation uncovered , or why she regarded them as showing that what happened was criminal			0
one possibility , admittedly speculative , is that the prosecutor concluded that @entity4 illegally confronted the victim with a weapon without just cause , and that that criminal act led to the shooting			2
because the critical facts of the case have not been revealed , it is impossible to predict how the case will fare when tested in the crucible of the courtroom			0
the evidence could be air - tight , but in cases from the @entity170 child molestation prosecution to the @entity172 rape prosecution , evidence that convinced prosecutors disintegrated in the face of vigorous defense advocacy			2
and @entity4 will almost certainly get a high quality defense , paid for either by himself and his supporters or by the state of @entity17 , which will want to ensure the appearance of fairness on a case in the spotlight			1
whatever else comes out of this incident , it is clear that it is risky for people to inject themselves into ambiguous situations they are neither properly trained nor legally authorized to handle			0
even police departments often train off - duty officers to call 911 rather than taking direct action , unless human life is at risk			1
if there was ever any doubt , this case demonstrates that that is the right approach for private citizens			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

@entity202 : charges show that " stand your ground " does *n't* mean " get out of jail free "
he says @entity4 is entitled to present his self - defense argument to the jury
@entity200 : proving second - degree murder charge is a high *bar* , but jury could convict on lesser charge
he says one lesson is that private citizens should not direct action in case like this
