-- there are two different races happening at the @entity3 this year -- one for movies , which is neck - and - neck with the @entity6 -- and one for television , which lags behind the @entity8			1
so while the @entity3 can act in some ways as a salve for @entity6 snubs and a predictor of @entity6 wins , it does n't have the quite same breathlessness when it comes to television , since the @entity8 are so last year ( ok , four months ago ) and , unlike movies , tv shows can have a track record of previous @entity3 wins			1
still , they provide a fun game of " who will win ? " and " who should win ? " to make your awards viewing ( and betting ? ) more manageable , here are some of @entity27 's most educated guesses , thanks to input from the nominees themselves			1
@entity3 movie nominees : who will win vs. who should win best television series -- drama " @entity41 , " " @entity42 , " " @entity43 , " " @entity44 " and " @entity45 " are all up against each other , like sweaty singles in a nightclub			1
" @entity47 " showrunner @entity46 , however , does n't think his show can really compete with " @entity49 in the crazy department			1
but we might be up there , sure			0
" he noted that " it 's an amazing time for tv drama , " and daunting to even think about the competition in that category			1
the showrunners for " homeland " -- @entity59 and @entity60 -- were thrilled to be recognized in another category this year : those shows which have been parodied on " @entity63			0
" " we 're officially in the popular culture ! " @entity60 said with glee			0
that @entity8 win does n't hurt , either -- " homeland " is a shoo - in ; it can , will , and should win			1
plus , it won last year			0
best television series -- comedy or musical the contenders are " @entity73 , " " episodes , " " girls , " " @entity76 " and " smash			0
" " @entity76 " also won the @entity3 last year , but what about giving another show a chance , perhaps one that had its first season last year ? " smash " is the only real musical of the group , even though it 's also a drama , which makes it an odd duck here , but " girls " feels like a natural winner			1
" it 's smart , and it 's funny , and i find the specificity of the dialogue really refreshing , " said " @entity89 " co-creator @entity88			1
" i love how it delves into the awkward moments , awkward sex , without shying away from it and in an unrelenting way			0
i 'm really rooting for ' girls ' and i think @entity100 is a genius			0
" you go , girl			0
best mini-series or motion picture made for television based on the @entity8 , you might well guess that " @entity109 " has this category on lockdown			0
but it 's up against " @entity111 , " " @entity112 , " " @entity113 " and " political animals			1
" ok , that 's not really much competition against the juggernaut that is " @entity109			1
" " at a function for ' recount , ' i mentioned to someone , ' i would have loved to been in the room when they made the decision ( to put @entity125 on the @entity127 ticket ) , " director @entity121 said			0
" i 'd been working on a spin doctors story for a long time , but then i thought , ' this is the story			0
' " even though " @entity109 " is such a powerful tale that it 's getting a follow - up , this category tends to favor mini-series over movies ( " @entity43 " won the previous year )			1
if the @entity136 is so inclined , might we suggest the very deserving @entity138 program " @entity113 , " which is oft - compared to " @entity139 " for its 1960s period setting , but is actually a drama about investigative journalists who get pulled into political and sexual scandals			1
best performance by an actress in a television series -- drama if " homeland " can and should win , so should its star , @entity149			1
her competition , however , includes @entity157 for " @entity158 , " @entity154 for " @entity155 , " @entity151 for " @entity43 " and @entity152 for " @entity153 " ( who was also nominated last year )			0
but outside of @entity160 ( who saw the final season of her show this year , always a cause for awards upsets ) , it 's not even close			2
as @entity149 previously told @entity0 , " i think people are rooting for ( my character @entity88 ) , and i 'm so honored to be playing her			0
" best performance by an actor in a television series -- drama we 'd say that what is good for the goose is good for the gander -- if @entity176 should win , so should her co-star @entity177			2
but that did n't happen at the @entity3 last year , even though he was nominated			1
( he did win the @entity8 , however )			2
and the race might be tougher for @entity177 this time , since his rivals include @entity184 for " @entity42 , " @entity180 for " @entity41 " ( both of whom were also nominated last year ) , @entity185 for " @entity139 " and newbie @entity186 for " @entity45			0
" but since " homeland " 's focus shifted this season , from the pressure on @entity88 to the pressure on @entity192 , @entity177 might take home a trophy			2
plus , he 's a @entity195 and this is the @entity136 , who tend to reward those things			1
best performance by an actor in a television series -- comedy or musical the @entity136 awarded this honor to @entity205 for " episodes " last year , but the show has n't held up			1
this gives previous winner and perpetual nominee @entity210 the favorite position -- especially given that this is the last season of " @entity213			0
" however , his competition includes @entity215 who is more identified with his program -- and not just because it 's his name			2
he 's the creator , writer , director , producer , editor and star of the show and won emmys for acting , writing and directing " @entity225 " this last go - round			2
@entity210 may win , but @entity215 should win			2
best performance by an actress in a television series -- comedy or musical the nominees this year include returnees @entity233 ( for " @entity235 " ) , @entity236 ( for " @entity213 " ) and @entity237 ( for " @entity238 " ) , plus two stars of two new shows : @entity241 ( for " @entity242 " ) and @entity100 ( for " girls " )			0
if @entity233 , @entity236 and @entity237 could n't beat winner @entity245 last year , they do n't provide much competition , even if two of them are @entity3 co-hosts			1
though sentimental value ( the last season of " @entity213 " ! ) might boost both @entity210 and @entity236 , she does n't think she 'll win ; she casts her vote for @entity253			1
we think it 's more likely , however , that @entity256 will take it , given her @entity8 win and " @entity242 " creator @entity261 's @entity260 roots ( again , foreign press decides this one )			1
but the one we 're rooting for is @entity100 , who plays a character who feels more real and authentic than most of what 's on television			2
best performance by an actress in a mini-series or motion picture made for television " @entity109 " may or may not win , but @entity272 as @entity125 will , even if her competition is @entity274 ( " @entity275 " ) , @entity276 ( " @entity277 " ) , @entity278 ( " @entity111 " ) and @entity279 ( " @entity271 " )			2
" @entity272 put so much heart and soul in that , " her director @entity280 said			0
" there 's so much political masking that goes on , you need someone who is a fully engaged human being first and foremost , beyond a candidate , and i thought @entity272 did an amazing job			2
" so did the @entity8			0
best performance by an actor in a mini-series or motion picture made for television like @entity272 , @entity297 will probably take this category			0
but also in the running are emmy - winner @entity300 for " @entity301 , " @entity302 for " @entity303 , " @entity304 for " @entity111 " and @entity305 for " @entity275			0
" " @entity109 " is a little too much of an @entity307 story for the @entity136 to sweep , so they might be willing to give this one to a more deserving @entity195 -- @entity302			1
his modern - day @entity309 is enigmatic , charismatic and wholly singular			0
plus , it 's his year , what with also playing the mysterious villain in the new " @entity319 " movie and the dragon and the @entity317 in " @entity318			2
" best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a series , mini-series or motion picture made for television after this past season of " homeland , " is there any question who should win ? still , @entity332 has some worthy rivals , including @entity334 for " @entity109 " ( and he just might win ) , @entity335 for " @entity76 " ( an awards favorite for comedy , but unfortunately he 's going against the drama guys ) , @entity339 for " @entity340 " and @entity341 for " @entity235			1
" @entity332 plays his character @entity344 with such nuance , fans of the show are still guessing whether or not he 's the mole in the @entity348 -- complicated by his rise in power at the end of last season			2
" i have my own theory , " @entity332 told @entity0			0
" as a matter of fact , i write my own theories underneath everything i say			0
and part of the fun for me is when i hit bingo , and get what the writers were doing			0
" best performance by an actress in a supporting role in a series , mini-series or motion picture made for television can the @entity370 take home the @entity3 now that @entity276 has been promoted from supporting to lead on " @entity277 : asylum " ? for @entity375 's sake , we would say yes			1
" @entity43 " deserves some love , and there 's no better recipient this year , considering the actress is also up against @entity380 for best actress for musical or comedy ( and there 's no chance there )			2
still , it 's not in the bag , and @entity388 ( " @entity158 " ) , @entity390 ( " @entity153 " ) , @entity391 ( " @entity76 " ) and @entity389 ( who is nominated for " @entity109 " ) are all in the running			0
we say @entity375 is the queen of zingers , and who better to liven up the @entity3 with a well - timed spike ? we do hope she 's interrupting something .			1

the @entity3 are *sunday*
there 's lots of speculation as to who will win in the tv categories
the @entity136 does n't mind rewarding the @entity405
