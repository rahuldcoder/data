-- after a deadly earthquake and tsunami struck @entity5 last friday , response team members from @entity2 were on the ground within 24 hours			1
the organization , founded by 2008 @entity9 @entity8 , provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies to families affected by disasters			1
these essentials come in a large , green box that shares the organization 's name			1
with an initial 600 shelterboxes en route to thousands of survivors in northern @entity5 , @entity8 's group is doing whatever it can to help a country in crisis			1
@entity8 spoke with @entity0 's @entity25 about nuclear fears and his group 's ongoing efforts in @entity5			1
@entity0 : how did you mobilize your team into action when you heard about the earthquake ? @entity8 : within minutes , we were moving			1
we look at our resources , what we 've got available , where our teams are around the world and how quickly we can get people on the ground			1
we 're fortunate that we 've got boxes positioned in different parts of the world and we 've got our response team members around the world			2
within an hour , we were looking at our people going , " go jump on an airplane , group together in @entity49 , and let 's get this thing moving			1
" we had our first people on the ground within 24 hours			2
there are boxes leaving every day in different numbers			2
we 've got people monitoring our team on the ground minute by minute			2
@entity0 : how are fears of nuclear catastrophe affecting ground operations ? @entity8 : every disaster 's unusual , this particularly so because of the nuclear problem that 's unfolding			1
we 're monitoring it hour by hour , and we 've got some world experts advising us on what 's happening			2
we do n't want to put people in harm 's way			2
we have to take advice from the experts and , of course , there 's an exclusion zone , so we 're not operating in that exclusion zone			0
unfortunately , that exclusion zone does encompass a lot of the most - devastated areas			0
but there 's other work that 's going on , more assessments that are being done and operational things we put in place			0
of course , working with the local community , we want to find out ( who are ) the most needy people			0
@entity0 : reports are out saying that millions of households throughout @entity5 have no access to safe drinking water			1
how will @entity2 address this and other needs ? @entity8 : clean water is becoming a problem , as will food very shortly			1
in every one of our boxes , we have what we call a family life straw			0
it 's a water - cleaning device , and it will clean enough water for 10 people for 12 months			0
you simply pour the dirty water in			0
it 's a mechanical device -- a filter system that has very clever silver chloride filters and iodine -- and it gives out clean water			0
that 's included in every one of our boxes			0
as a situation unfolds and the detail comes back , we coordinate with the local community and find out exactly what is useful			0
there 's always different ( items ) in the boxes			0
the box itself is usually useful			0
the tent , which is now universally known as one of the best aid tents in the world , is designed to keep people warm when it 's cold and cool when it 's hot			1
and ( there are ) state - of - the - art blankets because it 's very cold			0
@entity0 : you and your teams have been working nonstop for the last week			0
what keeps you going ? @entity8 : what keeps us going is very simple			1
it is that desperate need to help people as quickly as we can			1
and that 's infectious in our organization			2
there are over a million people in our tents now in over 60 countries around the world in the most difficult conditions			0
we do n't need any motivation -- the motivation is needy people			0
