-- recently , @entity1 announced that the @entity4 version of its @entity6 app now automatically routes users around traffic when providing directions			2
according to the @entity1 , @entity6 navigation previously " would choose whichever route was fastest , without taking current traffic conditions into account			1
it would also generate additional alternate directions , such as the shortest route or one that uses highways instead of side roads			0
" [ now ] , our routing algorithms will also apply our knowledge of current and historical traffic to select the fastest route from those alternates			0
that means that navigation will automatically guide you along the best route given the current traffic conditions			1
" it will be interesting to see , as this feature develops , how well it adjusts for recurring or special events that not only cause congestion but also block traffic			0
for instance , could @entity6 navigation account for street closures for fairs and marathons -- especially if they 're held in the same location annually ? what about drawbridges that tend to open at regular times ? or @entity44 parades ? or what about when streets get flooded , or when public safety agencies shut down access to an area in an emergency ? or what about when @entity52 bikers or zombie hordes overtake city streets ? so far , the @entity57 app lacks this traffic - avoiding feature , but it 's probably coming soon			1
for now , @entity57 users of @entity6 can still use the " alternate routes " feature , with the live traffic layer enabled , to find their own ways around traffic			2
or you can try the hd traffic feature on the @entity57 app , which , according to pocket - lint , has offered traffic - dodging functionality for some time			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity72 .			0
