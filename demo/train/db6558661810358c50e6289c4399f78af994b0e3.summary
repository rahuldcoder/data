-- when @entity2 walloped @entity3 in late august 2005 , @entity1 was in @entity4 , 10 states and 1,100 miles away from the storm			1
@entity1 , 24 , is originally from @entity4 , and works in politics in @entity3			1
fifteen months later , she traded @entity4 's streets for those submerged during what the @entity10 called the nation 's worst natural disaster			1
" i literally quit my job , bought a car , packed it up , drove down , " @entity1 , 24 , told @entity0			0
she said a college friend who was living in @entity3 persuaded her to quit her @entity18 job in financial communications -- a career that did n't make her happy and did n't fit her political science degree -- and move to @entity3			1
" it 's the best decision i ever made , " @entity1 said			1
now nearly a year into her position as director of communications for @entity3 councilman - at - large @entity25 , the @entity26 has become a self - described " grizzled veteran " of the @entity3			1
she speaks affectionately of the city 's people and of its slower pace , although she laughingly notes that she 'll " never ever " get used to the city 's soupy summer heat			1
she says she 's here for the long haul			1
" when i first moved down , i said , ' i 'll give it two years ... it 'll be my little adventure			0
' and something sort of funny happened almost immediately , " she said			0
" i felt immediately at home			0
" @entity1 is one of many young professionals who have arrived in @entity3 since @entity2 ransacked the city , according to experts who study population trends in the area			1
armed with college degrees and buoyed with seemingly boundless optimism and energy , these 20 - and 30 - year - olds have taken up work in various sectors of the community , ranging from business to politics , or in the several humanitarian programs helping to rebuild the city			1
" from what you can tell in talking to people and looking at organizations ... there does seem to be a significant influx of young , usually very well educated college graduates ... who have come to @entity3 to help , " said @entity54 , the @entity56 ' chancellor			1
" many have decided that this is an interesting place to live , and decide , at least for some short period of time , to stay here			1
" while there is speculation on whether the number of young professionals moving here actually constitutes a " significant influx , " there is ample anecdotal evidence to show that beleaguered @entity3 is softly luring young people looking for meaningful and purposeful work			1
dubbed @entity56 ' " brain gain , " these newcomers all have their own stories , their own path to the city			2
some were volunteers who arrived soon after the storm			2
others , like @entity1 , came well after			0
some are @entity3 natives , many are not			1
regardless of their hometowns , their professions , their reasons for moving , they are bound by a common thread : a pull to this city that so many left behind			2
" in other cities , " @entity94 , a 26 - year - old copy editor for an advertising firm , said , " i probably would have just done my job and gone home and been happy with that			0
because those other cities ... i do n't think would have needed my help as much as this city			2
" @entity94 worked in @entity4 for a time before he arrived in @entity3 , he said			1
" just being down here ... even if it 's just to help business down here , " @entity94 said , " anything that 's down here is helping			2
" after volunteering for a short time with @entity109 , a nonprofit group that supports entrepreneurs , @entity113 graduate @entity111 said she did n't want to leave			2
" being involved in that and ... getting to understand the city made me realize that the impact i could make here was so much greater than at a boring real estate economic research firm back home , " the 23 - year - old said			2
she gave up the well paid " boring " job in her hometown of @entity125 , @entity126 , for a full - time job with @entity109			0
and she has n't regretted it at all			0
" i believe in the power of place , " she said			0
" i think history incorporates itself not only in the architecture , but also the atmosphere of different cities , and in @entity3 you definitely feel that atmosphere and you can feel the history			1
and i think that 's what drew me closer to @entity3			1
" @entity140 , a geographer and associate director of the @entity142 at @entity143 , says there are probably 2,000 to 3,000 of these newly arrived young professionals in @entity3			1
in an e-mail , @entity140 said he bases this rough estimate on the 2006 @entity148 and @entity149			0
however , amid the city 's current population of 273,000 , this group of newcomers is a " small segment of the population , " according to @entity156 , the chief executive officer for @entity157 , a @entity3 research firm			1
they are by no means replenishing the approximately 40 percent of the city 's pre-katrina population who have not returned			1
" we are not the ' @entity165 ' in the country for these young people , " @entity156 said			2
@entity168 , a researcher with the @entity169 , which has kept detailed records and analysis of the city 's population since the storm , said his analysis of 2006 census data released this month shows that those in the 25 - to 35 - year - old age range were least likely to be present in the city by july of last year			1
still , @entity156 said , " there are a number of young people coming to help out			2
" what makes this group 's arrival notable , he said , is that before the storm , the city had difficulty drawing or keeping the young and educated			1
" we are attracting ... young people that we were n't before , " @entity156 said			2
asked whether @entity140 's estimate of 2,000 to 3,000 is accurate , @entity156 said it likely was			2
" it 's really probably in that range , " he said			2
hanging over these young people , however , is a persistent question			0
will they stay ? " i do n't think that many of those people have made permanent decisions , " @entity54 said , adding that the answer to that question depends on whether the city is able to fix many of its problems -- among them a weakened infrastructure , a high murder rate and limited career growth opportunities			1
" i think they 're willing to certainly keep an open mind about the future and see how things go over the next couple of years , " @entity54 said			0
" this is the most mobile segment of our community , " he said			0
" so guess what ? they 're going to be mobile			0
" for @entity222 graduate @entity221 , 32 , who arrived in june 2006 , the rate of progress can be frustrating			0
@entity221 is the school leader of the @entity223			0
" [ i 'm ] driving past the same potholes ... since last year , " he said			0
" they 're not being fixed			0
i know that 's just a pothole , but it 's also a sign of where the city 's at			1
" for @entity94 and @entity1 , crime is a concern			0
" @entity234 kind of freaks me out , " @entity94 said , adding that he also grows anxious when storms draw near			0
but both say it is n't enough to push them out of the city			0
likewise , @entity221 , a @entity238 , @entity4 , native , says he 's here to stay			1
" this is my new home , " he said			0
what about the question of whether to rebuild the city ? @entity243 , he says			0
" the question 's already been answered			0
we are rebuilding it now			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity249 contributed to this report .			0

experts say many young professionals have arrived in @entity3
group probably comprises a small segment of the city 's population
despite their love for the city , it is not certain if they will stay permanently
