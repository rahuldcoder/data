@entity0 -- locked in a battle with her brothers over their family treasures , the daughter of civil rights leader @entity3 said thursday she 'd once considered lending them but never selling them			1
@entity9 says her brothers ' plan to sell their father 's @entity12 and the @entity14 he was awarded 1964			1
@entity15 and @entity16 have sued to force their sister to turn over those items , and a judge has ordered the items stored in a safe deposit box that only the court can open until the case is resolved			1
in a statement issued thursday afternoon , @entity9 acknowledged that she had once considered selling other heirlooms , including the @entity27 the @entity28 awarded her father in 1957			2
but she said she had never believed it was acceptable to sell the @entity32 medal or @entity3 's traveling @entity12 , which was used by president @entity33 when he was sworn in for his second term			1
" at the time i agreed in 2007 to the potential transfer of certain memorabilia to the @entity39 , it was totally consistent with furthering the @entity3 legacy because of the nature of their mission , " she said			0
" they are a civil rights center			0
but let it be noted that i have and always will object to the sale of the @entity14 and @entity12 as i believe the sale of those items is sacrilegious and a breach of my obligation as a steward and trustee of my father 's legacy			2
" @entity3 was assassinated in 1968 , and his widow , @entity57 , died in 2006			0
in court papers , the @entity3 brothers submitted an e-mail inventory @entity9 wrote in 2007 that divided items from the estate of the civil rights leader into four categories : those she would be willing to sell , including the @entity27 ; items she would not be willing to sell , but might consider lending , such as the @entity14 and @entity12 ; items that had questions associated with them ; and items she would have to examine before deciding			1
but in thursday 's statement , @entity9 said that now , " i would not support the sale of most of the memorabilia listed in the 2007 e-mail			0
" the ceo of the @entity78 , @entity79 , told @entity1 on thursday that he had no comment on the legal proceedings and that his center had not bought any items from the @entity3 estate			0
but he said the center plans to display @entity3 papers sold several years ago by the estate and now owned by @entity88			0
@entity9 , who was 5 when her father was assassinated , is acting as the " gatekeeper " to her father 's property , said attorney @entity94 , who represents the @entity3 estate			1
he said she has no individual claim to the property that belongs to the estate controlled by her brothers			0
wednesday , @entity102 superior judge @entity101 ordered the disputed items placed " in a safe deposit box in an unknown location			1
" but he warned @entity9 it was likely that her brothers would be able to show " the @entity12 and peace prize are possessions of the estate			2
" according to the @entity113 ' complaint , @entity3 's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the estate of @entity3 , but @entity9 has " secreted and sequestered " the items in question			1
@entity9 has said her brothers told her on january 22 that they wanted the items so they could sell them			0
her attorney , @entity120 , called the attempt to sell the items a " money grab , " saying there 's a history of the @entity3 sons taking money made from selling possessions to line their own pockets			1
the judge compared @entity9 's stance against the sale of her father 's possessions to @entity135 not wanting to sell its secret soft drink recipe			2
he later noted he was not trivializing the value of @entity3 's possessions with the comparison			1
this is not the first time the family has been at odds over @entity3 's legacy			2
over the years , the siblings have sued and countersued one another			0
@entity9 and @entity16 sued @entity147 in 2008 , accusing him of converting " substantial funds from the estate 's financial account at @entity152 " for his own use			0
they agreed to a settlement , thereby avoiding a trial .			0

a judge has ordered her to turn over the items
the items will be stored in a safe deposit box that only the court can access
