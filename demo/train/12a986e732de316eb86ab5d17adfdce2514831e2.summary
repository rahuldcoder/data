global media tycoon @entity0 spent hours wednesday downplaying his political influence , even as @entity3 prime minister @entity2 said politicians in his country had been too close to @entity0 over the years			1
@entity0 insisted that his newspapers did not lobby for his commercial interests and he had " never asked a prime minister for anything			1
" @entity0 was being grilled about his relationship with politicians at an independent @entity3 inquiry prompted by illegal eavesdropping by his @entity14 newspaper			1
@entity0 told the @entity15 he does not believe in journalists using phone hacking or private detectives , calling it " a lazy way of reporters doing their job			1
" the media baron , who owns the @entity24 and the @entity25 in @entity26 , as well as controlling the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , also denied using the power of his press for personal gain			1
at the same time , @entity2 was saying politicians from across the political spectrum had been too close to the powerful media baron			1
" i think we all , on both sides of this house , did a bit too much cozying up to mr. @entity0 , " he told the @entity36 as his government was battered over testimony @entity0 's son had given the day before			1
@entity44 testified tuesday that before @entity2 became prime minister , he had met the politician over drinks at a pub and told him the company 's @entity24 newspaper would support his conservative party in the next election			1
meanwhile , @entity0 was having a bitter falling out with then - prime minister @entity53 , the elder @entity0 said wednesday			1
he told @entity53 his papers would not support @entity53 's @entity55 in the 2010 election , prompting @entity53 to respond : " your company has ... declared war on my government and we have no alternative but to declare war on your company , " @entity0 quoted @entity53 as saying			1
" and i said , ' i 'm sorry about that @entity53 , thank you for calling			1
' end of subject , " @entity0 said			2
he earlier insisted strongly that there had been no quid pro quo with @entity69 as @entity0 's papers switched support from the conservative party to @entity69 's @entity55 in 1997 -- not long before @entity69 swept into power as prime minister			1
" i , in 10 years in his power there , never asked @entity69 for any favors and never received any , " @entity0 said , pounding his hand on the table for emphasis			2
on tuesday , @entity15 lawyer @entity82 pressed @entity44 over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full ownership of satellite broadcaster @entity88			2
that bid that collapsed because of the phone - hacking scandal			0
evidence published tuesday suggests that @entity93 was getting inside information from the office of the government minister with the power to approve or block the acquisition , culture secretary @entity96			0

this is categorically not the case , " @entity96 said			0
@entity44 insisted before the @entity15 tuesday that he knew little about the scale of phone hacking by people working for the @entity14 , as he continued his fight to limit the damage the scandal does to him and his family 's media empire			2
the scandal has led to dozens of arrests on suspicion of criminal activity and forced @entity93 to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking			0
@entity44 and @entity0 have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them			2
underlings did not tell @entity44 how pervasive the practice was when he took over @entity93 's @entity3 newspaper publishing arm , he testified tuesday			0
he agreed with a suggestion that the reason was because they knew he would put a stop to it			0
" i think that must be it , that i would say , ' cut out the cancer , ' and there was some desire to not do that , " he told the @entity15			0
former @entity0 employees testified earlier that they told him about the problem			2
the younger @entity0 has already been called twice to testify before @entity3 lawmakers and resigned from a number of top management positions at @entity3 subsidiaries of his father 's media empire			1
he and his father have always denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking , which police say could have affected thousands of people , ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans			2

the suspects include at least one journalist and a police officer , the @entity167 said , declining to name them			0
