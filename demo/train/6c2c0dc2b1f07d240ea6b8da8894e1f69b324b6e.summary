@entity0 turned out wednesday for their country 's first elections since the death of @entity4 , a process that 's expected to dent but not end the hold of the party to which he 'd long been associated			1
the party @entity4 once led , the governing @entity9 , held an advantage based on very early results around midnight on wednesday , according to the @entity12			1
once all of the votes are counted , the @entity9 is expected to hold onto power			1
but it may have its grip weakened amid growing discontent , particularly among urban voters			0
the @entity9 , which has governed for the past 20 years , still enjoys widespread support as the party that represents the defeat of the apartheid system and the beginning of democracy in @entity26			1
but with president @entity27 dogged by scandals , economic difficulties and concerns over reports of rising corruption , the @entity9 could see its share of the vote fall from the 65.9 % it won in the 2009 elections			1
" many are hoping that the @entity9 will get a scare in these elections and begin to reflect on some of its failures , " wrote @entity0 political commentator @entity36 in an opinion article for @entity38			1
if the party 's share of the vote drops to 63 % or below , @entity36 said , it will mean that " the party is experiencing its second significant decline in two successive elections			1
" elections called ' a resounding success ' at the forefront of the issues that have blighted @entity27 's presidency is a scandal over his rural homestead in @entity57 , in the province of @entity59			1
the state watchdog has alleged that more than $ 20 million of public money was misused in improvements to the sprawling complex			0
@entity27 has denied any wrongdoing			2
but among @entity27 's support base in areas like @entity59 , many people remain loyal			2
" frankly they do not see a problem with him having let his home in @entity57 be refurbished at such a high price			0
in fact they see it as part of the perks of being a ruler , " said @entity71 , a professor at the @entity72 in @entity73			0
@entity81 began wednesday at 7 a.m at more than 22,000 polling stations across the country and finished at 9 p.m. , the press association reported			0
the millions of voters were charged with electing 400 members of @entity86 , as well as representatives in new legislatures in @entity0 's nine provinces , @entity12 said			0
while it did n't provide specifics , @entity0 's @entity90 reported " great turnout of voters , in particular first - time voters			0
" the same agency added late wednesday that security forces were on " high alert " throughout the day , arresting 97 people for election - related offenses			0
the @entity90 did n't report any violence , but noted the deaths of four people : two who died while waiting to vote , plus two party agents killed in a car accident			2
" government wishes to commend all @entity0 for the part they have played in making our elections a resounding success , " the agency said			0
" ... the nation 's fifth democratic elections have undoubtedly added to our legacy of regular and peaceful elections			0
" @entity12 reported that the @entity119 party had contested that account , claiming the process was flawed and that some people were allowed to vote more than once			1
past and future the @entity9 is facing its biggest challenges in cities , where analysts say discontent is on the rise , notably among young people , over a lack of quality education and jobs			2
" increasingly , @entity0 feels like a country caught between its past and its future , " @entity36 said			0
the situation is compounded by the fact that many disillusioned young people are n't registered to vote			2
opposition leaders like @entity140 of the @entity141 are seeking to connect with younger voters			2
" it 's key that they establish their own future , their new freedom , their new @entity0 , " he said ahead of the election			0
the @entity119 , a young party formed a few months ago by expelled former @entity151 leader @entity150 , is also trying to loosen the governing party 's grip on power			1
the @entity141 is quickly adapting itself from its reputation as a " white party , " and the @entity119 is fast becoming a player on the national stage , @entity36 said , but " both parties are only likely to give the @entity9 a real run for its money in the 2019 and 2024 elections			1

the @entity119 party says vote was not fair
the @entity9 is expected to retain power , but opposition parties could erode its *majority*
president @entity27 has been dogged by scandal
" many are hoping that the @entity9 will get a scare , " a commentator says
