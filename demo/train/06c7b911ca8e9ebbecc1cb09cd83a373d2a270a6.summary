@entity0 -- current tv filed a countersuit friday against its former star employee @entity4 , a day after the television personality filed his suit against the company			1
current tv , co-founded by former vice president @entity9 and businessman @entity10 , ousted @entity4 last week			1
the company 's 16 - page suit , filed in @entity13 , accuses @entity4 of breach of contract and dismisses as " fiction " the charges @entity4 leveled against it thursday			1
" in particular , @entity20 seeks a determination that it is no longer obligated to pay a dime to mr. @entity4 who , having already been paid handsomely for showing up sporadically and utterly failing to keep his end of the bargain , now seeks to be paid tens of millions more for not working at all , " says the cross-complaint , which was signed by @entity19 , a lawyer for current tv			1
the cross-complaint says that @entity4 leaked the financial terms of his contract ; refused to help promote the network ; was absent 19 of 41 working days in january and february ; and refused to participate in @entity20 's caucus and primary election coverage specials , then changed his mind just before the @entity33			1
@entity20 said it has upheld its end of the bargain , and then some , despite criticism from @entity4 , who was its highest - paid employee			2
" for example , he arrogantly and falsely calls ' cheap ' the company that has paid him the highest compensation he had ever received in his career , provided him the largest staff of any program he had ever anchored , given him the largest studio and custom - designed set on which he had ever worked , and paid over $ 50,000 in an eight - month period to eight different limousine companies because none of the previous seven were able to meet his @entity49 standards for how to drive him around @entity50 , " the cross-complaint says			0
it asks for current tv to be relieved of any continuing obligations to @entity4 , asks for unspecified damages " to be proved at trial " and seeks reimbursement for legal expenses			1
a call to @entity4 's manager was not immediately returned			2
on thursday , @entity4 had sued current tv in the same court , claiming breach of contract , unfair dealing and disparagement			1
@entity4 says he is owed $ 50 million to $ 70 million in cash and equity compensation , according to the suit , which seeks a jury trial			1
the lawsuit also seeks a judgment for other unspecified monetary damages , with interest			0
" this action is necessary as @entity20 has repeatedly and willfully breached its written agreement with @entity4 , " his lawsuit said , " often continuing to do so after receiving specific notices to cure such breaches			2
" in its most recent breach , @entity20 unilaterally , and without cause , terminated its agreement with @entity4			2
@entity20 's sudden and public termination of @entity4 was the latest in a series of increasingly erratic and unprofessional actions undertaken by @entity20 's senior management , " the lawsuit said			2
@entity4 's suit called @entity9 , @entity85 and current management " no more than dilettantes portraying entertainment industry executives			1
" in a statement thursday , @entity20 said it fired @entity4 for " serial , material breaches of his contract , including the failure to show up at work , sabotaging the network and attacking @entity20 and its executives			2
" it continued , " it is well established that over his professional career mr. @entity4 has specialized in pounding the table			0
" however , mr. @entity4 , by filing his false and malicious lawsuit , has now put this matter into a legal process where there will be an objective review of the facts			0
" we hope mr. @entity4 understands that when it comes to the legal process , he is actually required to show up			0
" @entity9 and @entity10 courted @entity4 to leave his previous employer , @entity114 , with promises of " an unprecedented level of control and resources to build a new progressive network , " @entity4 's lawsuit said			1
@entity4 was given " full editorial control over ' countdown with @entity4 ' " and the title of chief news officer , the suit said			0
but the relationship soured shortly after @entity4 joined the network , according to the suit			0
" admitting that he and @entity9 ' had expertise lacking in order to strategically execute the vision ( they had ) committed to ' @entity85 created an environment in which major business errors and technical failures became commonplace and acceptable , " the lawsuit alleges			0
" @entity85 also attempted to isolate @entity4 from his professional representatives in an awkward attempt to form a close personal friendship with his new star , " the suit says			0
when @entity4 did n't reciprocate , @entity85 withheld production resources and disparaged @entity4 in the press , the lawsuit says			0
@entity1 's @entity144 contributed to this report			0
