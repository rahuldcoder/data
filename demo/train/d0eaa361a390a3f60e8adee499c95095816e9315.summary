-- i 've just been watching the trailer for " @entity3 , " a show that will premiere on august 7 on the @entity5 during its child - unfriendly late - night spot , which they call @entity9			1
already at least one @entity11 group has begun to lobby the network to cancel the show , regarding its contents as blasphemous			1
( @entity5 is owned by @entity15 , which owns @entity0			0
) from what i can tell , the series is a bit of a spoof , with some foul language			0
the general notion seems clever : a guy who thinks he is @entity3 , who might even be @entity3 , lives in a poor neighborhood of @entity24 , @entity25			1
he 's got a ragged band of followers -- they look like winos and potheads -- who follow him around with lots of bantering			2
the scenes shown in the trailer seem relatively funny , and it appears that nobody is quite sure whether this is a madman who thinks he is @entity3 or maybe the lord himself come back in a strange outfit and , indeed , black skin			1
is this offensive ? the jury will have to be out until we see whole episodes , but in conceptâ € ” particularly if the rest of the show is like the trailerâ € ” it does not seem so			2
first , let 's look at the criticism : " @entity9 is not ridiculing any other religion and would n't dream of mocking @entity53 or @entity54 , but has no problem denigrating @entity11 " the conservative @entity11 group @entity56 writes on its website			1
it 's certainly a good point			2
people feel free to mock @entity60 and @entity3 , but they hesitate to mock @entity53			1
this is likely because some @entity63 fundamentalist groups can be more than touchy and sometimes dangerous			0
i generally do n't think one should attack @entity53 , as it obviously offends large groups of sincere followers , and there are some extremists ready to kill to make their point			0
it was , however , truly horrific to see what happened to @entity72 in 1989 when the @entity73 of @entity74 issued a fatwa ordering muslims to kill @entity72 , as he had written what the @entity73 considered a blasphemous novel , " @entity79			0
" i admire @entity72 immensely , as a writer and person , and i would argue that he had every right to publish " @entity79 , " at least in @entity84 countries			0
in the context of his book , a work of literature , he was clearly being satirical , and if satire goes , the whole shebang -- meaning literate and moral culture -- vanishes with it			0
satire is one of the essential ways that human beings have for looking at themselves and laughing , seeing themselves in a larger context			0
as someone once said , tragedy is a short - term view of things ; comedy is the long view			2
but is " @entity107 " appropriate satire , and does it do anything to harm @entity60 ? as a @entity11 myself , i like the idea of seeing @entity3 return in various guises , skin colors , outfits and social contexts			1
why not ? the jesus i know and love was something of a party animal			1
his first miracle was to turn water into wine at a wedding : and lots of wine was apparently drunk			0
at the @entity132 , in keeping with @entity131 tradition ( if you regard this as a @entity128 feast or seder ) , everybody was obliged to drink four glasses of wine			0
in @entity136 5:27 - 32 the @entity135 condemn @entity3 and his friends for eating and drinking with " publicans and sinners			1
" in @entity141 11:18 - 19 , we read that @entity3 is accused of being " a drunken and a glutton , a friend of tax collectors and sinners			1
" on and on , the image of @entity3 and his band , which includes a fair number of women -- including @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 ( see @entity136 8:2 - 3 ) -- seems one of a merry - making group , not a pious and bedraggled or depressed conclave			1
@entity3 met with whores and bartenders ( publicans ) and all sorts of marginal folks			1
it 's not unreasonable to think that , if he should return today , he would socialize as well with bums and pot - growers and winos , even someone from the @entity167			2
he would associate with anyone who would lend an ear , spreading his good news , which to @entity11 is the joy of the coming kingdom , the joy of giving one 's time and treasure to those in need , the pleasure of becoming @entity180 's hands in the world			1
this was what @entity3 did			2
christians should understand that following @entity3 means acting in the world in ways that improve it			2
@entity141 tells us in 7:16 : " by their fruits ye shall know them			0
" i 'm sure the message of @entity3 can survive " @entity3			1
" and i look forward to many other versions of @entity3 , in many settings			2
he would always speak in the lingo of the neighborhood , even if to some ears this might sound " foul - mouthed			0
" he would show irreverence of a sort , great joy , and a passion for justice			0
his sense of humor would take on many forms , as it did during his life			0
he would spread the gospel in whatever language and manner the context required .			0
