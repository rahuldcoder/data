-- sporting an all - black racing suit , @entity1 kneels next to his bright red motorcycle to check its oil levels and make sure the nuts and bolts are tightened properly			0
satisfied , he hops on his @entity8 and hits the bumpy dirt road , weaving his way through rugged tracks and treacherous terrain			0
being able to ride along narrow trails and carry out maintenance checks on a motorbike are not talents most health workers in the world need to possess , but for @entity1 these skills are crucial			0
as a community health nurse , he relies on his two - wheeled companion to reach the isolated villages dotting the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25			1
in an area where lack of roads and unreliable transport would typically force patients to spend several hours reaching the nearest clinic on foot or by bicycle , @entity1 's durable bike allows him to navigate through the bush to deliver life - saving treatment and health advice to rural communities			1
armed with a medical kit , his routine motorbike round includes visits to at - risk pregnant women and malnourished children			0
he checks them for any warning signs and , if needed , refers them to the nearest health center			0
he also distributes mosquito bed nets and food supplements and educates locals about life - threatening diseases such as malaria and @entity54			0
@entity1 says all this would n't be possible without @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , a social enterprise working to transform healthcare delivery across rural @entity25 and provide outreach health workers with the transport they need			1
the @entity64 - based group says it manages a fleet of more than 1,400 motorcycles , ambulances and other trekking vehicles in seven @entity70 countries , reaching about 12 million people			1
it trains @entity70 health workers to drive safely on difficult terrain and teaches them how to carry out simple maintenance checks on their vehicles on a daily basis			1
in addition , it ensures that there is a reliable supply chain of spare parts , while a network of local @entity57 - employed technicians services all bikes and cars monthly to make sure they do n't break down			1
" i received this motorcycle four years ago when it was brand new and i have ridden until now over 50,000 kilometers , " says @entity1 , whose work covers more than 10,000 people in 13 villages			0
" since i got my motorcycle i have been getting my regular supply of fuel and my motorcycle is being serviced regularly , " he adds			0
" all of this is towards my services within my community within the past four years , so actually it [ @entity57 ] has contributed immensely towards the successful implementation of my activities within my circuit			2
" millions of lives are lost needlessly every year from easily preventable and treatable diseases across @entity106 , according to the @entity107			0
it estimates that some 12,000 children in the continent die daily from illnesses and conditions such as pneumonia , diarrhea , measles , malaria and malnutrition			0
in many cases , the vaccines and medicines required for treatment are available but fail to reach the millions of people in need due to unreliable transport			0
that 's what prompted @entity64 racing journalist @entity56 and his wife @entity128 to put @entity57 together			1
it all began after @entity130 visited @entity131 in the late 1980s , where he observed scores of new - looking motorbikes and other vehicles lying broken because of poor maintenance			2
at the same time , he saw first hand the risks posed to mothers and children due to failed healthcare delivery			0
" @entity130 came back and said there are children in rural communities who really need to be reached because they need immunizations ; women are dying in childbirth and then 30 , 20 , 10 miles away in ministry of health car parks there are motorcycles and ambulances that are simply broken because nobody has been trained to repair them , there 's no supply chain of parts , there 's no knowledge of transport maintenance , " remembers @entity128 , a mother of three and former motorcycle racer			1
" we said , well , we 've got a young family , we 've got a mortgage but we really believe in this , " she adds			0
" it made us angry , actually , that women and children are dying in rural @entity25 simply because an old technology like a motorcycle or an ambulance with this internal combustion engine ca n't be managed -- well , that 's ridiculous , that is crazy			1
" the two life - long motorcycle enthusiasts made several more trips to @entity25 and eventually founded @entity57 in 1996			1
the award - winning group , which today has some 300 staff across @entity25 , raises funds at bike events and auctions as well as from charging the governments , agencies and @entity182 it works with a not - for - profit fee for its services			1
@entity57 says its work has enabled outreach health professionals to see nearly six times more people and spend double the time with their patients			2
they can also hold about 3,500 extra health - education meetings a month across the continent			0
moreover , the group has introduced a motorcycle courier service that speeds up the diagnosis and monitoring of patients suffering from @entity198 or @entity54 and enables them to start treatment early			0
in one year , @entity57 says , mobilized health workers have transported more than 400,000 medical samples and test results between rural health centers and labs			1
@entity128 says the wellbeing of rural communities changes dramatically once they get regular access to health services			2
" we have shown that the maintenance of vehicles is absolutely critical if you are going to be able to solve the health issues of rural @entity25 , " says @entity128			1
" and also we 've shown how transport can be run cost - effectively and how local people really benefit when they are trained to a high standard to be technicians because it provides employment in the communities			2
" in their mid- 60s now , the @entity222 are still as passionate about improving access to healthcare as they were when they first started @entity57			2
" what gets me up in the morning is the idea that health workers who are very highly trained -- women and men living across @entity25 -- really want to get out to their rural communities and make sure that they are healthy , " says @entity128			1
" they ca n't do that by walking and it makes me really angry that there is n't more emphasis on making sure that transport runs properly			2

@entity56 provides motorbikes to improve health care in rural @entity25
the group manages over 1,400 motorcycles and other vehicles in seven @entity70 countries
local technicians maintain the vehicles so they do n't break down
