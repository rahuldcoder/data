-- former world number one @entity1 insists he will not rush his recovery from a knee injury , casting doubt over the 14 - time major champion 's participation in next month 's @entity7			1
@entity1 has not played since he withdrew from the @entity8 in may , and is a doubt for golf 's oldest major -- which is due to start at @entity11 in @entity12 on july 14			1
the @entity14 has been hampered by injuries since he returned to the sport following problems in his personal life and a self - imposed exile from the sport in early 2010			0
" i 'm setting no timetable , which is very different for me , " the 35 - year - old told the @entity23 's official web site			2
" i 've played hurt before			0
i 've played through injuries , i 've played in pain			0
unfortunately i pushed it too hard and hurt myself , and this time around i 'm not going to do that again			0
" now ranked 17th , he has not claimed one of golf 's four major championships since the @entity33 , when he played on despite breaking his leg , and last won a tournament at the 2009 @entity37 masters			1
" all the years of playing when my knee was n't very good and playing through it , unfortunately i broke my leg and still played , " said @entity1			1

" he won when he was 46 , right ? i 've still got some time			2
i 'm 35 , i 'm not 65			0
i 've still got some years ahead of me			0
golf is unlike any other sport , " @entity1 said			0
he cited @entity51 's performance at the @entity52 , where the veteran @entity14 lost out in a playoff for the @entity54 to compatriot @entity55 , as an example of how age is not necessarily a barrier to success			0
" i mean , @entity51 was , what , 59 years old when he almost won ? we can play for a very long time			2
" @entity1 has won the @entity7 three times -- at @entity64 's @entity63 in 2000 and 2005 , then at @entity65 in 2006			1
the tournament is returning to sandwich in south - east @entity12 for the first time since 2003 , when @entity14 @entity68 was a shock victor in his debut appearance at a major event .			1
