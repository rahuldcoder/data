@entity0 -- a portrait artist promises to capture more than a photograph is ever able to : more than just a glimpse of a person 's external appearance , a portrait can display a person as they truly are			1
but how does the artists do it ? @entity12 is one of @entity14 's greatest portrait artists			1
some of the world 's most famous people -- @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , prince @entity21 , and @entity22 among them -- have sat to have their image -- and something of their essence -- captured by him			1
here , he meets prima ballerina @entity29 , artistic director and star dancer at the @entity31 , and explains how to create a stunning portrait -- from choosing a subject to immortalizing them in paint - broken down into a series of six - second @entity37			1
you want to choose people you 're going to find interesting company			1
it does n't even matter if you end up not liking them , if you find them interesting , then that makes for an interesting painting			1
it 's only if you find someone boring , then that tends to make the whole process harder			1
at the start you 're trying to get the overall shape of the picture and the composition			1
it 's tricky when someone has got a very interesting and beautiful face			1
i 'm torn between wanting to make it close up [ to the face ] -- and make it about the expression and intensity -- but at the same time the whole composition is really interesting			1
sometimes you get lucky and it happens very quickly and the first idea works well , and you get stuck straight in			1
sometimes it takes several goes			1
you might start one and not like it			1
or you might like some bits of it , and start it again using some parts and not others			2
a portrait is basically a document of a relationship between the artist and the sitter , and that kind of changes as you get to know each other			1
what i 'm doing is , although i 'm using paint , i 'm kind of drawing			2
the advantage of drawing straight onto the canvas is , the bits i like , i 'll keep -- and then it could be that it 'll stay as a study			2
or it might be that i 'll do another layer and another layer and then it 'll become more three dimensional			2
at this stage you do n't necessarily know what 's going to happen			2
the idea is that i start by laying down an under - layer of the picture , probably in quite muted colors , like i 'm doing here			2
and then once you 're happy with the idea of it , that it 's on the right lines , then i do n't have to be quite so fixed or concentrating so hard			2
actually , you start talking more and it 's partly then you see the animation in people 's faces			2
and then that 's what makes the thing come alive			0
you 've got very good , very strong eyes			0
it 's important to get that right -- more than anything else			0
sometimes it can take quite a long time but if you do get it right , that 's sort of the way into the picture , it 's the thing that captures someone 's attention when they glance at it			0
if you get that right , it 's hard for people to look away			0
it 's a very powerful thing			0
you ca n't fake it			0
if someone does n't have very interesting eyes , then you ca n't pretend			0
we are interested in faces more than other things			1
it 's natural , we get so much more information about what 's going on from other people 's faces , expressions and reactions			0
so much of how we communicate is n't conscious , it 's about how our faces react or do n't react or betray how we 're thinking or emphasize or exaggerate what we 're saying , or contradict it			0
if people really want to look at it while i 'm doing it , i 'll let them , but on the basis that they do n't say anything to me about it			0
maybe right at the end i 'll ask what they think , but in the middle you do n't want anything that will influence or distort what you 're planning on doing to it			0
it 's not often easy to judge at the time when you 've just done something whether it 's good or not			0
you might like something on the day because it 's what you were trying to do , but sometimes the best ones happen by accident			0
because if it was n't what you were trying to do that day , you do n't see it as a success			0
and it 's only by putting it away , forgetting about it , working on something else , coming back and finding it after , that you see it fresh and then you can be more objective about it			0
it 's nice having someone sit , but at the same time , the most interesting people are busy and have n't got all day			0
some things you can do without the person -- the dress and the pose you can do from the photos -- but then you try to get people back to sit for you for the face and the expression , for that bit , the photo does n't tell the whole story : you want to see , not just how someone looks , but how a person moves and how they react to things , and if you can get those things in , that 's what makes it come alive , really , and makes it more interesting than a photo .			1
