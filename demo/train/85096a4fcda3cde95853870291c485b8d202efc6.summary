@entity0 -- a model who was slammed with derogatory terms by an anonymous blogger has the right to learn the identity of her online heckler , a judge ruled			1
@entity10 complied with the court 's ruling , submitting the creator 's ip address and e-mail address			2
in august 2008 , a user of @entity17 , @entity10 's blogging service , created " skanks in @entity0 , " a site that assailed @entity21 , 37 , a @entity22 - born onetime cover girl who has appeared in @entity23 and other fashion magazines			1
the blog featured photos of @entity21 captioned with terms including " psychotic , " " ho , " and " skank			0
" on monday , @entity30 judge @entity29 ruled that @entity10 must hand over to @entity21 any identifying information it possesses about the blog 's creator			1
@entity34 , @entity21 's attorney , said @entity10 complied with the ruling tuesday evening , submitting to his legal team the creator 's ip address and e-mail address			1
only a valid e-mail address is required to register for a blog on @entity17			0
@entity34 said that once his legal team tracks the e-mail address to a name , the next step will be to sue @entity21 's detractor for defamation			1
he said he suspected the creator of the blog is an acquaintance of @entity21			0
the blog has not been operational for months			0
the unidentified creator of the blog was represented in court by an attorney , @entity50 , who said her client voluntarily took the blog down when @entity21 initiated legal action against it			2
@entity50 suggested that @entity21 is more interested in attracting publicity than restoring her reputation			0
she contended her client 's blog would have languished harmlessly in obscurity had @entity21 not filed suit			2
the site had negligible traffic and only five posts on it , all written on a single day , she said			0
in her ruling , the judge quoted a @entity69 court that ruled in a similar case that nameless online taunters should be held accountable when their derision crosses a line			1
" the protection of the right to communicate anonymously must be balanced against the need to assure that those persons who choose to abuse the opportunities presented by this medium can be made to answer for such transgressions , " the judge said , quoting the @entity69 decision			0
@entity21 's attorney said he was " happy that the court recognizes that the @entity83 is not a place where people can freely defame people			1
" but the blogger 's attorney strongly disputed the judge 's reasoning			1
@entity50 asserted that her client 's invective was not unusual for the @entity83 , and that hyperbolic online name - calling is so rampant -- " in comments sections , on @entity98 , on blogs " as to practically be part of the @entity96 's dna			0
she warned that monday 's ruling has " potentially damaging implications for free speech on the @entity83			0
" after the ruling , a @entity10 spokesman expressed sympathy for targets of internet insult - slinging , but said the company divulges user information only when ordered to do so by a court			2
" we sympathize with anyone who may be the victim of cyberbullying			0
we also take great care to respect privacy concerns and will only provide information about a user in response to a subpoena or other court order , " @entity10 's @entity114 said .			1
