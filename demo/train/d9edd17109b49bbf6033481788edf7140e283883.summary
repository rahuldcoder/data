twelve female students from @entity1 in @entity2 are experiencing a mysterious medical condition			1
their symptoms include stuttering , uncontrollable twitching movements and verbal outbursts			1
health officials say the symptoms are consistent with " conversion disorder			1
" dr. @entity11 , a pediatric neurologist at the @entity12 who is treating many of the students affected , said , " conversion disorder is a physical manifestation of physiological symptoms where there is traditionally some kind of stress or multiple stressors that provoke a physical reaction within the body			1
" @entity11 said the symptoms are real			1
it is not done purposefully			1
" @entity28 , a senior on the honor roll at the school , said she has been fighting this affliction since october			1
she said after waking up from a nap , " i got upset , i could n't stop stuttering			1
" during an interview with @entity37 's @entity36 , her symptoms were apparent : she was twitching uncontrollably , flailing her left arm and jerking her head to one side			1
@entity28 said she also faints and has seizures			1
the seizures are a result of her pre-existing epilepsy disorder , which had been under control for years			1
@entity46 , also a senior at the school , is exhibiting similar symptoms			1
" i took a five - minute nap			1
i passed out for five minutes and i woke up stuttering , " @entity50 said			1
she said her symptoms also started in october			1
@entity50 has a bruised forehead after banging it on her bedpost during a fainting spell , she said			2
officials at the school hired an independent third party to conduct mold and air quality tests but found no environmental cause for the girls ' illnesses			2
a statement posted on the school 's website said , in part , " the medical and environmental investigations have not uncovered any evidence that would link the neurological symptoms to anything in the environment or of an infectious nature			2
" @entity28 's mother , @entity76 said she does not agree			2
" i do n't think that all physical aspects of this have been exhausted ; not enough testing has been done			1
" @entity80 said she found out other girls were exhibiting the same symptoms when she brought her daughter to the hospital			2
the nurse said @entity28 was the fourth girl in a week to come in with the same issues			2
" i was very irate to not know that other girls were going through this			2
" she also disagreed with @entity11 's assertion that the girls are improving , saying , " nothing is getting better , you know , the girls are still getting worse			2
they have good days and bad days			2
" @entity11 is not sure why so many girls at the same school are suffering all at once			0
" i do know that traditionally when they 've ( doctors ) looked back at different events that occurred in a similar nature , a majority of the time it is girls			0
" according to the @entity106 , females are much more likely to get conversion disorder and it is more common in adolescents or young adults			1
@entity11 said she used the " diagnosis of exclusion " to determine what happened to the girls , which means using the process of elimination			0
she ruled out a laundry list of factors to reach her diagnosis , including infections , drug use , food allergies and vaccine reactions , specifically @entity119			0
the @entity124 agreed with @entity11 's diagnosis after speaking with several doctors who evaluated the students			0
" there are many causes of tic - like symptoms			0
stress can often worsen them , " said spokesman @entity131			0
" the doctors all agree that the symptoms these girls are experiencing are real			0
" this is n't the first time reports have surfaced of multiple students at one high school experiencing twitching symptoms			1
in 2007 , nine female students and one teacher were reported to have the same issues at @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147			0
the school spent $ 30,000 testing the school and the surrounding area but found no evidence of any environmental factors that may have contributed to the illnesses			0
the school principal , @entity154 , said after closely interviewing the students , they found six of them were faking the symptoms			0
the teacher who was affected is now symptom free and still teaching at the school			0
one student who got better within days , according to @entity154 , was determined to have had a reaction to medication			1
the other two students ' symptoms were eventually resolved			0
" we have n't had any other reported incidents since then , " @entity154 said			0
the @entity147 @entity169 also did an investigation and told @entity37 it found no contributing environmental factors and concluded the students ' symptoms , though varied , were consistent with a social phenomenon called " mass psychogenic hysteria , " which suggests real symptoms but no biological cause			0
@entity28 said all she wants is to get better so she can go to college next year			0
" i do n't think this is in my head			0
" @entity11 said she wanted to assure the public that this illness will not spread			0
" i feel we need to put an end to feeling that this is a mystery , that someone is going to catch something contagious			0
" she expressed confidence all the girls will get better , adding they have " an excellent prognosis			0

" conversion disorder " causes twitching , stuttering , verbal outbursts
doctor says it is caused by " stressors that provoke a physical reaction "
