@entity0 -- @entity3 's prime minister @entity2 came away from talks at the @entity5 reassured about @entity7 policy in @entity8 , according to foreign affairs analyst @entity9			1
@entity2 and president @entity10 capped their talks with an elaborate state dinner in a tent at the @entity5 tuesday night , the first such occasion in @entity10 's presidency			1
@entity9 , who attended the formal event , told @entity1 the dinner was a success : " my sense is there was a very warm feeling			1
the @entity3 prime minister was gushing and he 's not a man who gushes			1
" @entity7 and @entity3 officials spoke about the war in @entity27 , just as @entity10 is expected to announce -- on tuesday -- increased @entity7 troop levels in the region			1
" the forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated , " @entity2 said			0
" president @entity10 and i have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism			0
" @entity9 , author and host of @entity1 's " @entity9 : @entity42 " spoke to @entity1 wednesday about @entity7 - @entity3 relations			1
@entity1 : what was @entity3 hoping to achieve in the talks ? @entity9 : i think there are probably three things going on from @entity3 's point of view			1
one was to generally get a sense of whether @entity10 shares @entity51 's reorientation of @entity7 strategy in @entity8 to place a much greater importance on @entity3 and to place @entity3 at the center of the @entity7 view of @entity8			1
my feeling is that what they heard out of the @entity10 administration was very positive			0
and they had two specific goals in mind as well			0
they wanted to get the implementation of the @entity7 - @entity3 nuclear deal started , so there could be a transfer of civilian nuclear technology to @entity3			1
they heard some good things			0
but my sense is that the @entity10 administration is doing a broader review of the whole policy of technology transfer and is not going to do a special deal for @entity3			1
@entity1 : why is that so important for the @entity3 government ? @entity9 : the @entity3 look at their [ economic ] growth rate and the single biggest problem for them ... is energy			1
they 're a huge importer of oil			0
they 're in a race to find cheap energy through nuclear power , and for that they need access to western technology			0
and finally there is the whole set of " @entity92 " [ @entity27 and @entity93 ] issues and they just wanted to get a sense from @entity10 that he 's not going to withdraw from @entity27 and that the @entity10 administration does not take on a @entity93 view of @entity27			2
on all fronts , my feeling is they were basically reassured			2
@entity1 : what 's their fear about @entity27 ? @entity9 : their fear is that the @entity7 is desperate to get @entity93 to cooperate and in doing that is almost adopting @entity93 's concerns as their own concerns , accepting the @entity93 view that it 's very difficult for @entity93 to go after the @entity27 @entity109 or @entity110 [ @entity110 ] which started the @entity112 attack			1
@entity3 's view is that it 's not a question of capacity , it 's a question of will			2
secondly there 's the @entity120 issue , which they want to maintain as a bilateral issue without intervention by any outside party			0
they have a legitimate concern about the @entity93 not being willing to go after these forces			0
the @entity3 are concerned that the @entity7 not easily fall into trap that if only @entity120 were solved , then @entity93 will turn on all these militias that it created and has sustained for three decades			1
@entity1 : why does n't @entity3 want a third party involved in the @entity120 dispute ? @entity9 : basically there is no third party who the @entity3 trust enough			1
they feel @entity137 has always been pro-pakistan			2
for the last 70 years , the @entity7 has been mostly pro-pakistan and sided against @entity3 in the last war			1
it sent the @entity139 into the @entity140			0
the @entity3 feel they are the dominant power on the ground , so why should they accept international mediation ? they feel they are likely to get a better deal if they stick to their guns			2
@entity3 sees itself very strongly as a secular nation which accepts all religions , including @entity149			2
it has the second largest @entity151 population in the world after @entity153			0
for them to accept that because @entity120 has a majority of @entity151 , it can not be a part of @entity3 ... is antithetical to the national identity of the country			2
there 's a lot of opposition in the government to letting @entity120 be bartered away			0
@entity1 : what were the goals on the @entity7 side ? @entity9 : what the @entity7 has been trying to do since the @entity168 administration is to strategically reorient itself in @entity8 so it has much stronger relations with @entity3 and that it become @entity3 's closest ally among the major powers			1
the rise of @entity137 is altering the strategic balance in @entity8 , and by allying with @entity3 , the @entity7 can in a very subtle way place some sort of check on the potential for @entity137 expansion			1
there is also a powerful idealistic interest here , in seeing that the world 's leading democracy and the world 's largest democracy pair up			0
... @entity168 began this process , @entity51 powerfully accelerated it by taking off the table sanctions that were in place because @entity3 had nuclear weapons			0
so @entity10 is the third president continuing a strategic partnership with @entity3			0
... it 's a perfect example of a kind of hedge strategy : engage @entity137 but in case the engagement process does n't work , also have a strong and growing relationship with @entity3			1
then there 's the whole economic component to it			0
the @entity3 economy and the @entity7 economy are getting more closely intertwined			2
if you travel to @entity3 , you 're struck that every every university , every company , every @entity203 [ non-governmental organization ] has some kind of contact with its counterparts in the @entity7			2
at a people - to - people level , the relationship is very strong and that 's the most durable kind of alliance			0
@entity1 : there were reports that @entity3 was concerned about the joint statement @entity10 made with the @entity137 president			2
[ @entity10 said , " president @entity216 and i also discussed our mutual interest in security and stability of @entity27 and @entity93			0
and neither country can or should be used as a base for terrorism , and we agreed to cooperate more on meeting this goal , including bringing about more stable , peaceful relations in all of @entity8			0
" ] @entity9 : it 's a sign of the fact that there was unease in @entity3 about @entity10 and a new administration			1
the statement was fairly innocuous , though the @entity7 was ill - advised to have it in there			0
it was a mistake ... but a minor one			0
@entity1 : was prime minister @entity2 encouraged by the administration 's apparent intention to send more troops to @entity27 ? @entity9 : in his interview with me for last sunday 's show , @entity2 strongly supported the @entity7 presence in @entity27 , he strongly supported the mission and said the removal of the @entity109 government in @entity27 was a blessing for the whole world .			1

@entity3 prime minister 's state visit was capped with formal dinner at @entity5
