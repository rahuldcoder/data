@entity0 -- the @entity2 has agreed to review a civil liberties dispute over the government 's power to criminalize " support " of a terrorist organization			1
the @entity2 will review a key provision of the 2001 @entity9			1
the justices on wednesday accepted review of a key provision of the 2001 @entity9 , and whether it threatens free speech rights of those who would assist non-violent activities of designated groups			1
since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks against the @entity19 , federal prosecutors have pursued " material support " cases against at least 120 individuals or organizations , winning convictions in about half of those cases			1
nearly every such domestic terrorism - related prosecution has included that charge as part of the indictment			0
at issue is whether the congressional law allows prosecution of those with knowledge of " any service , training , expert advice or assistance " to a foreign terrorist organization , as designated by the @entity19 government			1
a federal appeals court in @entity44 , @entity45 , struck down several parts of the legislation , finding them too vague to satisfy the @entity48			1
the government then asked the high court to intervene and uphold the law			1
among those charged under the " material support " provision : @entity54 , an @entity55 captured on the battlefield in @entity57 ; the " @entity58 , " men from @entity60 , @entity61 , who attended an @entity64 training camp ; several men in @entity66 , @entity67 , who allegedly sought to travel to @entity57 to fight on behalf of the @entity69 ; a group of young @entity72 individuals who allegedly tried to assist a @entity74 terror group ; and @entity75 , an @entity76 activist in @entity77 , @entity0			2
the key plaintiff in the current appeal is the @entity80 , a @entity81 , @entity45 - based non-profit that says its mission is to advocate " for the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts and for worldwide compliance with humanitarian law and human rights law			2
" @entity80 sought to help the @entity88 , a group active in @entity89			0
known as @entity88 , the party was founded in the mid- 1970s and has been labeled a terror organization by the @entity19 and the @entity92			0
its leaders have previously called for militancy to create a separate @entity97 state in parts of @entity89 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , where @entity102 comprise a population majority			0
in its appeal to the high court , the government noted that " since its inception , the organization has waged a violent insurgency that has claimed over 22,000 lives			1
" @entity80 claimed it wanted to advocate on behalf of the @entity88 before the @entity111 , and conduct other advisory sessions and public awareness campaigns			0
another plaintiff is an @entity76 physician who wanted to help ethnic tamils in his native @entity116			0
much of the island nation is controlled by the rebel @entity118 , which has also fought for decades to carve an independent state			0
the government claims the @entity118 have " used suicide bombings and political assassinations in its campaign for independence , killing hundreds of civilians in the process			2
" @entity80 and a group of @entity129 doctors say they merely wanted " to provide their expert medical advice on how to address the shortage of medical facilities and trained physicians " in the region but " they are afraid to do so because they fear prosecution for providing material support			0
" the @entity9 was passed six weeks after the 9/11 terrorism attacks			2
it included amending a previous anti-terror law to strengthen the " expert advice and assistance " provision , making it a crime punishable by a 10 - to 15 - year prison sentence			1
the @entity149 calls the material support provision " a vital part of the nation 's effort to fight international terrorism			2
" officials told the justices the law is constitutional since " the statute in question regulates conduct , not speech , and does not violate the @entity162 in any of its applications			2
" and the government argues lawmakers properly used their authority to address a pressing problem			0
" @entity171 has banned a broad range of material support -- regardless of whether the terrorist group claims to engage in otherwise lawful activities , and regardless of whether the support is ostensibly given to assist those supposedly lawful activities , " said the administration 's brief			0
the case is @entity179 ( 08 - 1498 )			0
oral arguments will be held early next year , with a decision expected by the spring .			1
