@entity0 , @entity1 -- to the family of @entity4 , the man who dashed into their burning home and pulled their loved one to safety through intense heat , falling embers and dense smoke could just be @entity14			1

" i did not feel too heroic , " @entity15 told reporters			1
" it all happened very , very quickly and i just feel very blessed that she and i got out of the building alive			2
" @entity15 , 42 , has fostered a reputation as a hands - on mayor of sorts , once spotted shoveling city streets during a 2010 blizzard and using his @entity33 feed to coordinate snow plows and the delivery of supplies			1
his latest feat for his constituents went viral friday as news of the rescue spread and social media users quickly dubbed him " super mayor			1
" a new @entity45 blog named @entity46 was thrown together friday with tongue - in - cheek memes about the mayor 's knack for getting things done			2
" just another day , saving @entity0 , " read one			0
for his part , @entity15 was quick to cast off the " superhero " title			1
" i think that 's way over the top , " he said outside his home			0
" there are people who do this every day , " referring to police officers , firefighters and other first - responders			0
" i 'm a neighbor that did what most neighbors would do , which is to jump into action to help a friend , " @entity15 said			1
the incident began around 9:30 p.m. thursday as @entity15 was en route to his @entity0 residence			1
two members of his security detail -- already waiting outside for the mayor -- noticed flames coming out of a second - story window of the neighbor 's home and called fire dispatch before banging on the door to alert the home 's occupants			0
the security officers , detectives @entity85 and @entity86 , managed to rescue three people by the time @entity15 arrived			1
" as the last one was coming out , i was going up the stairs and she 's screaming that her daughter is still in the building , " @entity15 recalled			2
flanked by the two detectives , @entity15 rushed toward the building , he said			2
" something exploded and sent a lot of flames over the steps , and my detail just grabbed me and started trying to drag me out of there , " he said			0
@entity15 exchanged heated words with @entity85 , who was pulling him by the belt to get him to safety			2
" look , this woman is going to die if we do n't continue , " @entity15 recalled saying			2
the detective relented and let him continue on			0
once inside , @entity15 had what he described as his " proverbial come - to - @entity108 moment " as he felt the intensity of the heat and had trouble finding @entity4			1
" the reality is i did n't feel any courage			0
i felt fear , " he said			0
" i 've never been so almost convinced that this was it			0
it was time to hope that i was going up and not down			0
" but just as he was " praying , thinking , hoping , " @entity4 called out and @entity15 found her in a back room			1
hoisting her , @entity15 ran through the flames , embers falling from the ceiling , and made his way outside before collapsing onto the sidewalk			2
" her mother gave me a hug i 'll never forget for getting her out , " he said			0
" at that point , i felt this sense of gratitude			0
to go moments from thinking you 're dead to kissing the @entity0 pavement ... i felt like i was delivered from the fires of hell			1
" thursday 's rescue marked @entity15 's latest foray into the media spotlight			1
the mayor has enjoyed a steady rise in national prominence as an outspoken advocate for urban issues since taking office in 2006			0
his efforts to turn around a city long struggling with high crime , chronic poverty and a restrictive budget are chronicled on the @entity148 's series " @entity149			0
" his reputation also contrasts with that of several previous @entity0 mayors , a few of whom were convicted on corruption - related charges			0
@entity4 is being treated at @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity1 , where she is in serious condition , officials said			1
@entity0 fire director @entity160 said the three other residents who were removed from the home " are doing well			0
" " it 's like one in a million , the mayor to get your family out , " said @entity163 , 20 , who is @entity4 's nephew			1
