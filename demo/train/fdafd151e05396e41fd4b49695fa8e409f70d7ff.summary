-- the mayor of @entity3 's goodbye concludes friday at 5 p.m. , when his resignation -- submitted last week after a string of women accused him of sexual impropriety and boorish behavior -- becomes effective			1
a spokeswoman for @entity10 did not immediately return a call , and the city website -- still showing his photograph -- did not outline what he planned to do on his final day at the helm of the country 's eighth - largest city , which has 1.38 million residents			1
but attorney @entity19 , who represents several of his 19 accusers , held a news conference with " some of his victims			1
" " @entity26 will finally be free of @entity10 and all the shame that he has brought to the city , " @entity19 told reporters			1
" this is a day for celebration and a day for congratulation			2
" the former nine - term @entity33 congressman began what was to have been a four - year term last december , but resigned last week as the accusations grew			2
an apology and promise to seek help , delivered on july 11 , failed to save his job			2
" i have diminished the office to which you elected me , " he said in a prepared statement			0
" i have reached into my heart and soul and realized i must and will change my behavior			0
as someone who has spent a lifetime fighting for equality for all people , i am embarrassed to admit that i have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me , and that at times i have intimidated them			1
" he added , " i am also humbled to admit that i need help			0
i have begun to work with professionals to make changes in my behavior and approach			0
" opinion : no room for lecherous mayors but the @entity61 accepted his resignation on august 23 in a 7 - 0 vote , after which the 70 - year - old mayor offered a " deep apology			1
" " the city should not have been put through this , " he said			0
" and my own personal failures were responsible			0
" still , he insisted , he had " never sexually harassed anyone			1
" while he was " trying to establish personal relationships , " the mayor said , " the combination of awkwardness and hubris , i think , led to behavior that many found offensive			0
" he added : " not one allegation ... has ever been independently verified or proven in court			0
" " but the hysteria that has been created ... is the hysteria of a lynch mob , " @entity10 said			1
politicians and the news media had " unleashed a monster , " and the resulting " hysteria ended up playing into the hands of those who wanted a political coup -- the removal of a democratically elected mayor purely by rumor and innuendo			0
" city council president @entity93 , a fellow @entity94 who had called on @entity10 to resign , is to serve as interim mayor , and a special election is scheduled for november 19			1
" obviously , the biggest deal is just to clean up @entity100 , " said @entity97 , the incoming interim mayor 's deputy chief of staff			1
he will also review all of the city 's departments " to find out what 's working and what 's not and what might have been hidden over the last nine months , " she said			2
@entity107 will work to " restore some of the trust of @entity109			0
" the city website , which displayed a smiling picture of @entity10 , " will be switched around five today , " she said			1
" i know that @entity112 is on it			0
" the agreement does not affect a lawsuit brought against @entity10 by @entity116 , @entity10 's former communications chief			1
though she remains a municipal employee , @entity117 left her job in july , when she sued the mayor , saying he had subjected women to " crude and disgusting " comments and inappropriate touching			2
she has been offered her old job back , @entity97 said			0
the city 's liability does not end with his departure			2
and @entity10 himself is hardly out of the woods			1
he faces one lawsuit , and a spokesman for the state attorney general said a criminal investigation is under way			0
numerous public officials , including all nine @entity61 members and the state 's two @entity141 senators , had urged @entity10 to step down			1
so , too , did most locals , according to polls			0
some of them voiced that view to @entity61 members last week			0
others rose to support @entity10			1
@entity149 said that " everything but due process has occurred , " while one woman called the political machinations " a circus to get a good man out of office			0
" @entity0 's @entity157 contributed to this report .			2

@entity10 's resignation becomes effective at 5 p.m. ( 8 p.m. et )
in all , 19 women have accused @entity10 of impropriety
@entity10 apologized but said he " never sexually harassed anyone "
