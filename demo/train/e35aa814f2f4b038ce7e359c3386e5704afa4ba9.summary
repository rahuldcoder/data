@entity0 -- a winged piece of history sits parked at a small airport			1
it 's 70 years old , and in a few minutes , i 'll know firsthand if this old warbird can still fly			1
in all , nearly 13,000 @entity8 rolled off the assembly lines			1
now , only about a dozen flying b - 17s remain -- in the entire world			1
these are the famous bombers that helped the @entity14 win @entity15 every year planes like these are retired to aviation junkyards , destined for a rusty demise			1
but there 's a group out there working to preserve the precious legacy of these planes by keeping them flying			1
ok , that 's all nice and everything -- but it 's not really at the top of my mind			1
right now , i 'm just trying to fit inside this thing , along with seven other passengers			1
getting aboard involves stepping up a short ladder and ducking through a small hatch in the back of the plane			1
seat cushions ? surely you jest			1
instead , the @entity8 offers webbed , canvas seats bolted to the side walls of the cabin			1
they make seating on a small regional jet comfortable by comparison			2
ready for an unforgettable flight ? you bet			2
i need to pay attention			2
@entity51 , our host , is announcing something important			2
" whatever you do , " @entity51 tells us , " do n't touch the overhead cables			2
" there they are -- just a couple of feet above me			2
the wire cables directly connect cockpit controls in the front of the plane to the tail rudder and " elevators " in the back			2
basically , they help steer the plane			2
so yeah , we kind of need those to work			2
note to self : do n't touch the cables			2
tip no. 2 : stay away from the bomb bay doors			2
they can probably hold no more than 110 pounds			2
any heavier than that , @entity51 says , you 'll be doing some unplanned skydiving without a parachute			2
by the way , there are parachutes on this ancient plane , right ? nope , says @entity51			2
as the plane 's four propeller engines sputter to life , i 'm tweeting ( with misspelled words ) about how loud they are and how they 're spewing the smell of oil			2
" a great sound and smell , " @entity90 tweets back			2
inches from my head sits a replica machine gun			2
near that , a side window with a view of the plane 's whirling propellers			2
before i know it , the pilot is gunning the engines and we 're accelerating down the runway			0
it 's bumpy , deafening -- and we 're airborne ! @entity107 indicates it 's safe to stand up and walk around -- although there is n't much to grab on to			0
this waist gunner station -- because gunners stand up in the middle of the aircraft -- was the most dangerous job on the aircraft because they were so easily targeted			0
images of faceless military crew members who 've flown aboard this plane cross my mind and -- @entity121 ! -- the plane takes a surprise left bank 1,600 feet above @entity0 ! hold on ! keep in mind no one is shooting at us			0
combat conditions here were uncomfortable at best : no temperature - controlled , pressurized cabins			1
imagine trying to fight off enemy planes amid the overwhelming roar and the freezing cold seeping in from outside			0
i 'm not the only aviation geek who 's awestruck			1
i look around to see other passengers who clearly get it : flying aboard this plane puts them a little closer to history -- and a lot closer than they 'd feel in a dimly lit aviation museum			1
they 're trading smartphones and taking photos of each other , to treasure the moment			0
" i ca n't wait to tell my dad about this , " one avgeek tells me			0
at one point i step carefully across a gun ball turret embedded into the floor , where a small gunner would fire on enemy planes			0
a stiff wind whips into my face through a quarter - inch - wide gap between the turret and the plane 's body			1
waaaaay down below i can see the trees and homes of @entity0 rushing by at about 160 mph			0
that 's solid ground down there ! despite the windy gaps , the @entity8 was named the @entity8 for a reason			1
its resilient design gained a reputation for taking a beating and still bringing its crew home alive			0
as for this crew , the pilot starts lining up with the runway and we 're told to buckle up			0
we touch down on the runway			0
the old - fashioned tires give a weird little yelp			1
our 20 - minute adventure is over			1
for me , the stories i 'd read in history books had come to life			0
the experience was nothing short of thrilling			0
these refurbished warbirds are as close as most of us will ever come to understanding the horror and stress of aerial combat during @entity15 amazingly , some are still able to fly across the nation , visiting air shows from coast to coast			1
last weekend , " @entity203 " -- the plane i flew on -- traveled from its home base in @entity201 to @entity0 's @entity202			0
the planes are operated by the @entity207 , a national group which has been working to restore and maintain flying warbirds since 1957			1
events like these offer younger generations a living , breathing , real - world lesson about these planes ' contribution to history			1
" unlike static museums , you can go out and see them in their natural state , " says @entity218 , @entity207 president			1
" you get the oil , the smoke , the smell			0
you can ride inside them and imagine			0
" during battle , @entity229 often escorted @entity231 for protection -- engaging in dogfights with enemy fighters , if need be			0
they were among the fastest and most nimble fighter planes of the era			1
less than a few hundred are still flying today			0
" you do n't really have time for emotions " during dogfights , says @entity241 pilot @entity240			0
@entity240 escorted b - 17s during the 1944 d - day @entity248 invasion of @entity250			1
" you 're not thinking too much about what you have to do			0
you do it because you 've been trained to do it , and your experience makes you do what you 're supposed to do			0
" now 93 , @entity240 destroyed six enemy planes between september 1943 and august of ' 44 as part of the @entity260 's @entity259 " @entity263 of @entity264 , " out of @entity261 , @entity262			0
mustangs were made for two things : shooting and speed			1
they bristled with guns and boasted a top speed of about 300 mph			0
" it was n't hard to fly , " @entity240 says			1
" it was a very stable , easy airplane			0
" on d - day , @entity240 took off from @entity262 toward @entity250 during a night mission to escort b - 17s			1
later that day , @entity240 's squadron was among more than 1,000 fighters in the air shooting up " convoys , tanks and trains and buses and motorcycles -- whatever moved toward the beaches			0
" when he first sat down inside a @entity229 cockpit , @entity240 was only 21 years old			0
" all of us can reflect on what were doing at age 19 , 20 , " says the @entity207 's @entity218 , a former @entity287 aviator			1
" now put yourself in these complex airplanes , flying thousands of miles over water , away from home to drop bombs while you 're being attacked			0
it 's pretty amazing to think about			0
" related story : @entity274 paratrooper jumps again , 70 years later the @entity207 operates 162 restored warplanes from @entity15 and beyond and shows them at air shows and airports across the @entity301 " to educate @entity301 about what these aircraft did -- and what role they played in our freedom , " says @entity218			1
the air shows help fund its $ 24 million yearly budget , along with membership fees and donations			1
its members number about 12,000			0
by next year , the @entity207 plans to move its headquarters from @entity315 , @entity316 , to a small executive airport southwest of downtown @entity318			1
there , the group plans to build a $ 40 - million , world - class aviation museum			1
" we expect to attract a quarter million visitors a year or more , " @entity218 says			1
" and we 'll have aircraft on display in a unique venue			0
" @entity240 says " the glamour days are over			0
" he knows dogfighting is all but obsolete as more aircraft attack by using precise , long - range guided missiles			1
" in the future , most of the air combat will be what they 're beginning to do today : long - distance firing and drones , " @entity240 says			1
" recently , i heard a general say that the last fighter pilot has already been born			0
it takes about 20 years to raise and train a fighter pilot			0
imagine what the technology will be in 20 years			0
in the future , there wo n't be any dogfighting			0
" as the " greatest generation " passes on , @entity218 says @entity301 's youngest generation has no understanding of @entity15 and what it was like to defend the nation during those dark times			1
with that in mind , the @entity207 sees itself as much more than a group of warplane enthusiasts			1
" we 're here to inspire , " @entity218 says			0
" we can use the inspiration of what they accomplished then to inspire us accomplish great things in the future			0

only about a dozen @entity15 - era b - 17 bombers still fly
nearly 13,000 " @entity8 " were made , starting in 1935
the @entity207 restores and flies b - 17s and other classics
the @entity207 plans a $ 40 - million , world - class aviation museum in @entity318
