-- so many visitors to @entity2 see little more than the beautiful but crowded @entity4 coast or the great mosques and palaces of @entity7			1
but the country is huge , and there are many more attractions away from the tourist hotspots			1
relics of vanished civilizations , a vast inland sea with a water - loving cat and a @entity18 mountain with views deep into @entity20 and @entity21 are just some of the reasons to go			1
see it all from a train for people who like intrepid journeys but like them even more when they 're sitting or lying down , the @entity2 rail system is heaven			1
from february 2014 , if all goes to plan , you 'll be able to whiz between @entity7 and @entity31 , @entity2 's capital , on a new high speed train			1
the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) leaves nightly at 6 p.m. and takes just more than 24 hours to trundle from @entity31 to @entity37 , almost 1,500 kilometers away in the remote northeast			0
it stops at the cities of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , passes through the rolling fields of @entity45 and ends among snow - topped eastern mountains			1
the two - berth cabins have a mini-fridge stocked with mineral water and soft drinks , and washbasins with hot and cold running water			1
a porter makes your bed and brings drinks and snacks during the day , and there 's a dining car			1
you can book online at @entity60 , or by phone ( +90 0216 337 8724 ) , but the @entity63 version of the site is clunky -- it 's easier to book through a travel agent or buy tickets at a station			1
tickets cost $ 45 in a one - berth cabin on the @entity31 - @entity37 route			1
@entity73 rare ruins it sometimes feels that you ca n't walk more than a few paces in @entity2 without stubbing your toe on some millennia - old relic			1
some sites -- such as ever - popular @entity81 -- are packed with visitors almost all year round			1
but remarkably few people visit the equally spectacular @entity84 , where you can wander around a square kilometer of ruined temples and theaters with only tortoises for company			0
the site reached its zenith around 2,000 years ago , when it was famed for its sculptors			0
you can see some of their work in the excellent on - site museum			2
@entity84 is around 160 kilometers from the coastal resorts of @entity99 , @entity100 or @entity101			0
the easiest way to get there is by car , and car rental is available at all resorts and at @entity107			0
@entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 ; +90 256 448 8003 ; open ( site and museum ) april - october , daily 10 a.m. -7 p.m. ; november - march , daily 10 a.m. -5 p.m. ; admission @entity113 ( $ 4.50 ) 3			2
sail an inland sea up to 400 meters deep and almost 120 kilometers across , @entity115 is a true inland sea			1
with no outlet , its waters are saturated with mineral salts that turn the shallows milky blue			0
in its depths , colonies of extremophile bacteria form weird , 40 - meter - high towers			2
only one kind of fish -- pearl mullet or inci kefali -- has adapted to live in its hyper - alkaline waters			1
@entity131 is also famous for a breed of water - loving and often odd - eyed cat , and is rumored to have its own monster			1
you can swim in the shallows , where it 's almost impossible to sink beneath the surface			2
more than a thousand years ago , the lake was part of the kingdom of @entity21			2
the ancient @entity147 @entity146 ( @entity145 ) church on @entity148 , three kilometers from thev lake shore , has remarkable frescoes and carvings , which have recently been restored			2
it can be visited by a combination of dolmus and small boat from @entity155 , about 50 kilometers from @entity115			2
@entity156 , @entity157 , 40 kilometers from @entity158 and @entity115 ( +90 432 612 4038 ) , offers boat trips to @entity148 and other islands in the lake			0
cycle among mountains @entity2 has thousands of miles of mountain and forest trails			1
some of the most spectacular cycling country is in the @entity168 mountain range and the valley of the @entity170 , where you can also go whitewater rafting			2
with several peaks rising well above 3,000 meters ( the highest , @entity175 , is 3,932 meters high ) , these mountains are snow - covered much of the year			2
in summer -- the best time to visit is june to august -- they 're cooler than better known cycling spots closer to the @entity4 for a really big adventure , you can follow mountain roads all the way down to the @entity183 coast and fly back to @entity7 or @entity31 from @entity184			1
you can fly to @entity43 from @entity7 or @entity31 , or take the train ( see above )			0
the @entity186 is around 120 kilometers north of @entity43 and more than a thousand kilometers east of @entity7			0
follow an epic walking trail the @entity188 feels like a path trodden by the ancients but in fact this walking route stretching from the @entity193 coast to the @entity4 was pioneered in 2000 by an @entity196 - based expat , @entity195			2
for most of its length , it parallels the @entity188 coast , but it soars to 1,800 meters above sea level at its highest point , the shoulder of @entity204 ( @entity205 )			2
the best place to start ( or finish ) is the small resort of @entity208 -- there are village guesthouses and campsites along the way			2
you need at least four weeks to walk the entire 509 - kilometer distance , but public transport is plentiful -- so you can walk for a week , or even just for a day or two			1
several airlines fly to both @entity107 ( about 50 kilometers from @entity208 ) and @entity217 from @entity7 and direct from @entity219 airports			0
best times to go are april - may and october			0
more information at @entity222 or @entity223 6			0
@entity224 @entity225 is said to have come to rest on top of @entity2 's highest mountain , the 5,137 - meter @entity224 ( @entity224 )			1
some believe it 's still there			0
from the summit of @entity224 , you can see a vast swath of @entity2 and deep into @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity224 is a hard slog , requiring some technical mountain skills			0
the terrain is rugged , and climbers must contend with extremes of heat and cold -- the highest summit is snow - covered all year , and summer temperatures at the foot of the mountain can reach more than 30 @entity246 it 's essential to go with a trustworthy specialist company , avoiding amateur local guides who claim to know the mountain but lack skills needed for a safe trip			1
getting to the top and back takes at least five days , using mules to carry tents and supplies			0
the ascent starts from the the city of @entity260 , about 1,500 kilometers east of @entity7			0
nearest major airports are at @entity43 and @entity115 , both around 4 - 5 hours ' drive			0
@entity263 , @entity264 4 , 06050 @entity265 , @entity31 ; +90 312310 1578 getting around travel in @entity2 is affordable and efficient			1
if you mix and match road , rail and air transport , there 's no part of the country you ca n't reach			1
every town has its otogar ( bus station ) , from which air - conditioned , long - distance coaches zoom to all points of the compass			0
on board , you can expect free tea , soft drinks , water , snacks and a squirt of eau de cologne from smartly dressed stewards			0
you can buy tickets in advance , but you should shop around for the best fare , because several lines compete on each route			0
for shorter journeys , you can pile into a dolmus			0
these minibuses run on fixed routes , but not at fixed times -- they leave when they 're full			0

@entity2 is huge yet most visitors stick to a tiny part of it
ancient ruins abound -- some of the best are weirdly under - visited
there 's an inland sea with a water - loving , odd - eyed cat
and a mountain where @entity225 got stuck -- *apparently*
