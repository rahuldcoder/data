many have struggled with drug and alcohol addiction			0
@entity25 founded the group in november 2013 after being moved by what he saw on his morning commute through downtown streets : " these folks were just sitting there waiting for something , and what that was it was almost like they were waiting for a bus , but the bus came and went and they were still on the wall			2

audience member @entity92 , who calls the choir 's music " true art , " says seeing @entity6 makes him want to make a difference against homelessness			1
