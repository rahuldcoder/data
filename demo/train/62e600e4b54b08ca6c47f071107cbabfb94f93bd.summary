-- they say the first step to overcoming a problem is realizing you have one in the first place			1
if you asked me whether i 'm addicted to my smartphone or whether i overuse it , i would say absolutely not			1
i pride myself on not keeping my devices ( i have two of them ! ) in my bedroom while i sleep , and keeping them out of reach on the kitchen counter when i 'm home with my kids			1
but , every time i walk into the kitchen , i find myself checking my email and @entity21 feed			2
there 's almost a gravitational pull toward my @entity24 and @entity25 even when i know the chance that there is anything i need to see at that moment is next to zero			1
i feel that same pull the minute i wake up and make checking my devices one of the first things i do once i get out of bed			1
those behaviors alone probably put me in the " you have a problem " camp , but i 'm sorry to say there 's now even more evidence			1
i recently took the " @entity39 , " an online quiz administered by the @entity41 , one of the few organizations focused on the issue			1
' i 've got a problem ' the quiz asks questions like : " do you find yourself spending more time on your @entity39 than you realize ? " and " do you feel reluctant to be without your @entity39 , even for a short time ? " if you answer " yes " to more than five of the 15 questions , " you might benefit by examining how much time you spend on your @entity39 , " according to the quiz			1
i answered " yes " to 11 questions			0
i 've got a problem , and i 'm not alone			2
dr. @entity56 , the director of the @entity57 , says around 90 % of @entity58 would fall in the category of overusing , abusing or misusing their devices , according to a recent nationwide telephone survey he did with 1,000 people in conjunction with @entity65			1
" the analogy that i use is right before they go to bed , the last thing they do before they pass out is check their phone and the minute they open their eyes , they check their phone , " said @entity56 during an interview			0
" does n't that sound like a smoker ? this is what we used to hear with smokers is that the last thing they would do before they go to bed is they 'd have their last cigarette			0
" 61 % of respondents in the survey said they regularly sleep with their cell or smartphone turned on under their pillow or next to their bed , and more than 50 % feel uncomfortable when they leave their smartphone at home or in the car , or when they have no service or their phone is broken			1
signs you are truly addicted @entity56 , who is also author of " @entity106 : help for @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , " says fewer people would actually be classified as addicted to their devices			1
that number is around 10 to 12 % , according to his latest research			1
" what puts somebody in that category is they are using it to a point where they are experiencing some degree of withdrawal			0
they are developing intolerance , meaning they are using it more and more , " said @entity56 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity125			0
" they are using it like a drug so they 're bored , they pick up the phone			0
they 're tired , they pick up the phone			0
they 're lazy , they pick up their phone			0
they 're angry , they pick up the phone			0
they 're lonely , they pick up the phone			0
" to fall into the addicted camp , @entity56 also says your smartphone use has to have " some deleterious impact on a major life sphere , whether it 's an impact on your work , your academic performance , your home life , primary relationship , parenting , legal status			1
" " let 's say you get pulled over and get a ticket for texting and driving			2
there has to be some negative impact generally for us to say you have a problem , " @entity56 said			2
and while the majority of @entity58 would n't be classifed as addicted , and are more likely overusing their devices , there is a fair amount of denial at work , he said			1
@entity56 's research found that while 98 % of respondents said that texting while driving is dangerous , nearly 75 % admit having done it			1
" just like drinking and driving , people have a very poor perception of impact , so , in other words , people will be doing their normal thing , " he said			2
" they 'll be driving and balancing their cell phone and drinking their coffee , and they 'll say to you , and they 'll mean it , that they are not impacted ... but actually we know from a lot of data and research that that is absolutely not true			0
" @entity191 : our mobile ' addiction ' so how else can you tell if you might be addicted to your smartphone or if you fall in the larger category of your smartphone use getting out of hand ? i asked on social media and got a tremendous response from people who were on their smartphones at the time ! here are ten of my favorite responses : ten signs you may have a problem 1			1
when you check your phone to see the current temperature instead of opening a window , and / or when you check your phone to see the current time instead of looking at the watch that 's right on your wrist			2
( i just did this ! ) 2			0
when you have to consciously say to your spouse " let 's put our phones away " while watching tv because it 's more common that they 're out than away			2
if you are answering emails in a dimly lit reception area while waiting for your massage therapist to destress you , you may have a problem			2
( ok , i 've done this too ! ) 4			0
when your kids have to text you their carry - out orders because you 've lost the ability to retain information that is not received on your phone			0
when you hope you hit a bunch of red lights on the way home so you can comment on a @entity237 post			0
when one of your daughter 's first drawings of you has a blackberry in your hand			2
when you wake up , you grab your phone and check it before you get up to pee			0
when you drop a phone on your face because you 're dozing off			0
when you choose your clothing based on the best pockets to hold your phone			0
when you are staring at photos you took on your phone while the actual moment is taking place right in front of you			0
( done that too ! ) i promised ten but here is one more that cracked me up : if you let your lunch get cold so you could answer a query -- on your smartphone -- about signs you may have a problem with your devices			1
do you think you are addicted to your smartphone or have a problem with how much you use it ? tell @entity265 on @entity21 or @entity266 on @entity237 .			1
