@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 said friday that it will file a lawsuit against five @entity5 security guards cleared of manslaughter charges in the 2007 killing of 17 @entity1 civilians , an act a government official called murder			1
the @entity1 government also will ask the @entity14 to appeal a federal judge 's " unfair and unacceptable " dismissal of the charges thursday , spokesman @entity12 said			1
an @entity1 man wounded in the 2007 incident also voiced his anger friday , saying @entity23 district judge @entity22 's dismissal of the charges showed " disregard for @entity1 blood			1
" @entity22 found thursday that prosecutors wrongly used the guards ' own statements against them			1
" we were expecting that @entity23 justice system is fair and independent , " said @entity29 , a lawyer			0
" it 's clear that the justice system in @entity23 is unjust and unfair			0
" @entity34 said " investigations carried out by specialized @entity1 authorities unequivocally found that the @entity5 guards committed murder and broke use - of - force rules when there was no threat requiring the use of force			1
" the september 16 , 2007 , bloodbath in @entity0 's @entity45 , which also left two dozen wounded , led @entity1 's government to place limits on security contractors hired by @entity5 and other contractors			1
@entity5 has since changed its name to @entity5			0
the @entity5 employees were guarding a @entity54 convoy in western @entity0 when the shooting began			0
the company said its contractors came under attack , but @entity1 authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate			2
@entity22 found that the government 's case was built largely on " statements compelled under a threat of job loss " during a @entity54 investigation of the shootings , violating the fifth amendment rights of the five men charged			1
" in their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case , the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation , " @entity22 wrote in a 90 - page decision			2
federal prosecutors " repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced , senior prosecutors assigned to the case , " the judge said			0
in the ruling , which followed three weeks of hearings , @entity22 said the explanations prosecutors and federal agents offered for using the guards ' statements were " all too often contradictory , unbelievable and lacking in credibility			2
" " in short , the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants ' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt , " he wrote			0
there was no immediate response to the decision from the @entity14 , which can appeal the ruling or seek new indictments against the men			1
the men were guarding a @entity54 convoy moving through western @entity0 when the shooting began			0
the company said its contractors came under attack , but @entity1 authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate			2
each of the now - former guards -- @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime			0
prosecutors requested that charges against @entity117 be dropped in november , but thursday 's ruling dismissed the counts against all five			2
" we 're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them , " said @entity113 's lawyer , @entity129			1
a sixth guard involved in the shootings , @entity136 , pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter			0
@entity2 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
