-- " are you running for president ? " " when will you announce that you 're running for president ? " " why wo n't you just announce that you 're running for president ? " " you would n't be have gone to @entity5 if you were n't running for president , would you ? despite the world aflame , @entity8 spreading and the @entity9 in the playoffs , it seems the only thing the political press can do is speculate about a potential @entity15 presidential candidacy			1
keep in mind we are two years and two months away from the next presidential election			2
and yet the urgency is fierce , bordering on indignation : " why wo n't she just tell us if she 's running ? " well , why should she ? an announcement now would be stupid , and @entity15 is definitely not stupid			1
if she were to go @entity25 on us now it would draw attention from crucial midterm elections , siphon campaign donations from @entity30 struggling to hold onto the @entity31 and possibly even eclipse important debates on how to fight @entity33 and whether to shut down the government ( again )			0
there is little such insistence about , say , @entity38 gov. @entity37 or @entity40 gov. @entity39 or even two - time loser @entity41			0
we presume they 're running -- just as most folks presume @entity15 is			1
but we 're not hectoring them at every turn ; we 're not resentful that they have n't made a formal announcement			1
probably because we just do n't care as much about them			0
they 're not leading in the polls by a million points ( nor will @entity15 , if and when a campaign is underway ) , and they simply do not rivet the national attention the way the former first lady , former senator , former secretary of state and future ( ? ! ) first female president does			1
i have not been in touch with @entity15 , so i do not speak with intimate knowledge			1
but i have known her for -- jeez , 23 years			0
and i actually believe her when she says she has not completely made up her mind			1
@entity15 is a wonk who 's had to learn the rhythms of campaigning			1
that 's very different from , say , @entity70 gov. @entity69 , a glad - handing natural for whom it can be said that if an idea wanted to cross his mind it would need to bring a canteen			2
@entity15 believes politics should be about ideas -- a clash of visions , of competing plans to promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense			2
this , after all , is a woman who rings in each @entity85 by standing and singing " @entity86			0
" but there are aspects of campaigning that she loves : a vigorous honest , face - to - face debate ; a town hall meeting in which folks ask substantive questions ; meeting people who pour their hearts out to her , who hold their baby daughters up to her , who share their hopes and their heartbreaks with her			0
so i can imagine that there is an angel on her shoulder whispering , " who needs it ? " who needs the phoniness , the vacuity , the mind - numbing , bone - wearying , soul - crushing grind ? but on the other shoulder stands another angel , whispering , " because it 's worth it			2
" if you care about , say , universal pre-kindergarten -- an issue @entity15 has cared about and worked on for decades -- or finding ways to stimulate job growth ; if you care about peace abroad and supporting our military families at home ; if you care about the climate crisis and full equality for @entity128 @entity127 and voting rights and a million other issues : the best way to make turn those ideas into action is through the presidency			1
@entity15 will decide soon enough			2
in the meantime , let 's let her listen to both of the angels debating for her heart			0
and maybe we can even give her a little breathing room as she becomes a grandmother			0
we have plenty of other potential presidential candidates			0
i suspect they 'd love the attention .			0

the political media wants to know why @entity15 went to @entity5 recently
@entity151 : they are almost indignant over why she wo n't declare her candidacy
even if she want to run for president , it does n't make sense to say it now , @entity151 says
he says it 's just as likely that @entity15 has not completely made up her mind
