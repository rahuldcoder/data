-- think back six months			0
you probably never had heard of a little website called @entity3			1
now it 's the third most - visited social - networking site in the @entity5 , according to a report released thursday by @entity7 , a digital marketing firm			1
@entity3 , which lets its users " pin " photos and info from the internet onto virtual boards , ranks behind only @entity15 and @entity16 in terms of total visitors , according to the analysis , titled " the 2012 @entity20 : benchmark and @entity21			1
" the ranking is based on the total number of @entity5 visitors during march and does not include mobile traffic , according to @entity7 spokeswoman @entity26			1
last month , @entity15 had more than 7 billion total visitors ; @entity16 had 182 million ; and @entity3 had 104 million total visits from people in the @entity5 , according to data sent to @entity0 by @entity7			1
that ranking puts the newbie site ahead of heavyweights such as @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			2
" the site has really just rocketed , " said @entity38 , another spokesman from @entity7			0
" it 's just been tremendous since ( @entity3 ) took off around october and then in the last few months			2
with @entity3 , it 's kind of a new take on an old thing			2
the way people are sharing on @entity3 is new			2
" one caveat : since the data does n't include mobile traffic , sites such as @entity16 , which sees much of its traffic from smartphones and tablets , may take a hit in this ranking , @entity38 said			1
@entity3 's traffic jumped 50 % between january and february			1
the report calls the site " the hottest social media start - up since @entity15 and @entity60			1
" those stats add momentum to a site that already had become one of the hottest topics of conversation on tech blogs and was known to be one of the fastest - growing networks			0
in february , @entity3 was the third - fastest - growing site on the internet in the @entity5 , with 17.8 million unique visitors that month , compared with 11.7 million in january , according to a report from another internet tracking company , @entity73			1
plus , it ca n't hurt when the @entity5 president joins your website			2
@entity3 launched in march 2010 , but it has grown rapidly only in the past six months			0
unlike many social - media darlings , tech bloggers in @entity78 largely ignored the site until they noticed that it was growing like mad			0
the site 's co-founder , @entity81 , sounds somewhat surprised by the growth			0
" it 's a really humbling feeling that all these people are using something that you helped make , " @entity81 said in an on - stage q&a at last month 's @entity86 conference			0
at that conference , he announced that an @entity92 app and new pinboards were coming soon			0
those boards -- where people pin photos of products they 'd like to buy and other interesting bits of info they find while trolling the @entity70 -- are key to @entity3 's success , he said			0
" to me , boards are a very human way of seeing the world , " he said at @entity86			0
" the site is about helping people to discover things they did n't know they wanted -- things that feel like they 've been handpicked just for you			0
" some other @entity3 - y stats for you to chew on : the site skews female -- about 60 % of users are women -- and to the middle of the country , according to the report from @entity7			1
@entity3 is most popular relative to other social networks in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , the report said			1
