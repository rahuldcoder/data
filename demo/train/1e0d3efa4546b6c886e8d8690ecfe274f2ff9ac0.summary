the 71 - year - old ex-police officer accused of shooting dead a man inside a @entity3 movie theater wo n't get the chance to go home -- at least for now -- after a judge friday decided not to grant him bail			1
judge @entity8 made his decision after two days of wrenching , evocative , at times seemingly contradictory testimony inside a @entity14 , @entity3 , courtroom			1
" the state did , in fact , meet their standard , " @entity8 said of prosecutors argument that @entity16 should n't be allowed to post bond			1
" and i am going to detain mr. @entity16 , pretrial			2
he will remain in custody			0
" @entity25 ' lawyer signaled his intention to appeal a decision that -- while not unexpected , given this is a homicide case -- he believes is unwarranted			2
the attorney , @entity29 , said that he 's optimistic about not only the appeal on bail , but that a jury of six citizens will side with his client			1
" mr. @entity16 is truly an innocent man , " @entity29 told reporters			1
" and we look forward to proving that at a jury trial at some point			2
" the widow of the man that @entity16 killed , meanwhile , applauded @entity8 's decision			1
" i 'm just very happy and relieved , " @entity42 said			2
" ... i have no doubt in my mind that it was the right decision			0
" no threats before shooting , widow says was it self - defense or an overreaction ? as @entity8 took pains to point out , his opting not to grant bail has nothing to do with his or others assessment of @entity16 ' guilt or innocence			1
that wo n't happen until trial			2
the date for that has n't been set , though @entity8 did schedule the next pretrial hearing for march 12			1
that falls on one day under two full months since @entity65 was shot dead inside the @entity67 theater in the @entity69 suburb of @entity70			1
was the younger , more physically imposing @entity42 killed in self - defense , as @entity16 ' lawyer claims ? or did @entity25 overreact -- to the idea that @entity42 was texting his toddler daughter as movie previews played -- by taking out his gun inside the theater and firing , as the prosecution argues ? the bail hearing , which began wednesday and resumed friday after a day off , served almost as a mini-trial in itself			1
both sides called witnesses , then often strongly challenged those put on the stand by the other side			0
@entity16 ' daughter , @entity87 , testified that her father was supportive and even - keeled , having never erupted in anger at a stranger from her recollection			2
the prosecution called a number of people who 'd been in the @entity3 theater the afternoon of january 13			0
@entity96 talked about overhearing @entity16 and @entity42 talking , and at one point , the latter said , " i 'm just texting my 2 - year - old daughter			2
" soon after that , a " very agitated " @entity25 left the theater , then returned a few minutes later			0
at that point , a fairly calm @entity42 -- according to @entity102 , a retired @entity103 veteran who worked as a clandestine officer -- asked aloud whether he could check a voice mail from his daughter 's babysitter			0
the situation devolved after more words were exchanged			0
@entity111 , an off - duty @entity112 sheriff 's corporal , said he heard @entity42 say , " i am trying to text my f * * king daughter , if you do n't mind " -- using graphic language that @entity16 ' lawyer said suggested @entity42 was angry and threatening			1
popcorn flew in @entity16 ' direction soon thereafter			2
" and almost immediately , " recalled @entity102 , who said @entity42 threw the bag , " the gun comes out and there are shots fired			0
" @entity25 to police : @entity42 ' scared the crap out of me ' @entity111 testified that , soon thereafter , @entity16 ' wife told her husband " that was no cause to shoot anyone			1
" @entity16 responded by pointing his finger at her and saying , according to @entity111 , " you shut your f * * king mouth and do n't say another word			1
" on friday , those in the @entity14 courtroom got to hear from @entity16 himself -- not because he took the stand , but because audio of his interview with police was played in court			2
during that interview , @entity16 told police he had " reason to believe ( @entity42 ) was going to kick my ass " after @entity16 confronted the 43 - year - old @entity149 veteran over his texting during the previews to " @entity152			2
" widow : ' my whole world just got shattered ' @entity16 and his wife both told police that @entity42 began using foul language , and @entity16 left to talk to a theater manager			1
when he returned , @entity42 stood up and turned to confront @entity16 , he said			0
" i see that he 's very explosive , unnecessarily , " @entity16 told police			1
" it scared the crap out of me			0
" @entity42 edged toward @entity16 -- and " he 's virtually on top of me " -- and @entity16 told him either " no , no , no " or " whoa , whoa , whoa , " he could n't remember which , he told the police interrogator			1
" he hit me with something			0
i assume it was his fist , " @entity16 told police			0
" i think he had a cell phone in his hand because i saw the blur of the screen			0
... my face went sideways			0
my glasses came partially off			0
" in her own interview with police , @entity180 backed much of her husband 's story , spelling out the f - word for police as she described @entity42 's language during the altercation			0
asked , though , whether she saw @entity65 strike @entity16 , she replied no -- though she said it 's what her husband told her after the shooting			1
the same went for the various theater witnesses who testified earlier for the prosecution			0
none of whom said that they saw @entity16 getting hit by anything beyond perhaps a bag or some kernels of popcorn before he opened fire			0
surveillance video captures theater shooting beyond hearing from various witnesses , the public -- thanks to the gathered media -- got their own glimpse of what happened inside that movie theater , thanks to surveillance video			0
the jumpy , grainy footage shows @entity25 return to his seat at 1:26:19 p.m. , according to the video 's time stamp			0
six seconds later , @entity16 appears to lean forward , but only for a second			1
at 1:26:30 p.m. , the video stops -- likely because the motion sensors were n't activated , according to previous testimony in @entity16 ' bail hearing this week -- but it starts recording again five seconds later			1
that 's when a hand extends in front of @entity16 , from the seat where victim @entity65 was reportedly sitting , and appears to snatch something from @entity16 -- the defense has repeatedly said @entity42 threw popcorn -- and throws it into @entity16 ' face			1
@entity16 ' right hand , the one @entity16 told police he used to shoot @entity42 , thrusts forward at 1:26:37 p.m. a strange dust falls in front of the surveillance video lens as theater patrons begin walking over to the area where @entity16 remains seated			1
it 's the row behind where a mortally wounded @entity42 -- after stumbling then collapsing on another moviegoer -- is taking his last breaths			0
couple describes encounter with @entity25			0

lawyer : @entity16 will appeal bail ruling , looks forward to trial
@entity65 's wife says she 's " very happy and relieved "
judge @entity8 sides with prosecutors , who said @entity16 should n't be allowed bail
@entity16 is charged with murder in the shooting of a man who *allegedly* texted in a theater
