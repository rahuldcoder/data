-- i make a living encouraging politicians and candidates to use social media			1
and now i 'm going to tell them why it 's a bad idea			1
not always , mind you -- social media will , and should , continue to play an important role in our political discourse			1
but the trend has grown so quickly ; i do n't know that anyone has really stopped to consider the implications of moment - by - moment , real - time transparency			0
i would argue that what we 've gotten is a trade - off , and the jury is still out on whether what we 've lost is worth more than what we 've gained in the process			1
so before i go about the process of destroying my company 's business model , let 's talk about what we 've gained with social media			1
the @entity31 and social media have created a level of transparency that never before existed in our country			1
people sitting at home can research complicated issues with a few clicks of a mouse			1
online campaign disclosure databases make pay - for - play politics far more difficult to obfuscate			0
instantaneous tweeting of shady government practices -- and the resulting uproar -- means that public bodies are more responsive than ever			1
but there 's an unintended consequence , too , of over-democratization			2
wait , you ask , how can we have too much democracy ? well for starters , we do n't live in a democracy			0
we never have , nor should we			0
we live in a republic , where we elect people to take the tough votes and make the tough decisions for us			2
and quite honestly , politicians should have some level of flexibility to cast votes that -- gasp -- we might not like , without their every action becoming a referendum via @entity65 and @entity66			1
a quote sometimes attributed incorrectly to @entity68 goes , " @entity69 will endure until the day @entity70 discovers that it can bribe the public with the public 's money			2
" today the same sentiment could be said about the danger of shutting naysayers up on @entity65 and @entity66			1
too many politicians are n't voting their conscience , they 're voting to placate blog commenters , and that 's no way to run government			1
secondly , it 's one thing to see the sausage get made			2
it 's another thing entirely to watch the pig get slaughtered			2
there 's a domino effect when it comes to transparency			2
in policy making , lots of ideas are thrown out in order to set the good apart from the bad , and in order to stake out a position for compromise			2
cynics would refer to it as " backroom deal - making in a smoke - filled room			0
" but here 's the harsh reality -- that 's how bills get passed			1
and it 's how every important collaborative effort since the dawn of the written word has been achieved			2
after all , do you think the @entity110 would have ever been written if @entity111 and @entity112 had @entity65 accounts ? third , government by social media leads to an environment where in every setting a politician has to be " on			1
" when politicians are hashing out ideas , those ideas can range somewhere between politically untenable and electorally suicidal			0
once they 're tweeted -- be it by a journalist or a rival politician -- they become tv ad , direct mail , and attack e-mail fodder			0
during the discussion , an idea is thrown out about " what would be the implication of zeroing out funding for popular program x ? " suddenly , that politician is facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in negative ads back home , telling his constituents that he " considered " or " proposed " eliminating @entity137 two weeks ago , @entity138 made a passing reference to eliminating @entity140			0
it wo n't be long before president @entity143 's team is cutting ads about @entity138 " proposing " that we leave millions of @entity147 homeless			0
factually accurate ? sure , but misleading as hell			0
the result is a political discourse that is becoming devoid of real ideas , and instead pared down to the safest of talking points			0
and because most politicians draw their own districts to shield against a viable challenge from the opposite party , they are far more susceptible to electoral defeat in the summer than they are in the fall			0
their audience in everything they do is the primary voter , not the swing voter			0
so the rhetoric throughout the year from both parties is increasingly divisive , increasingly partisan , and increasingly destructive to any kind of progress			0
is any of this a product of social media ? no , absolutely not			1
@entity147 politics have been trending this way for decades			0
but technology has expedited our descent toward a political system devoid of real ideas and bold , controversial thought			0
as the use of social media accelerates , it 's incumbent upon everyone involved in the political process to make sure its power is used to harness everything good about the @entity147 political system , rather than to hasten political trends that are hurting our republic			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1

@entity194 : social media gives people *unprecedented* ability to see political process
he says there 's a risk politicians will become too *dependent* on @entity65 , @entity66
compromise , productive bills happen behind closed doors , not transparently , he says
@entity194 : politicians have to lead and represent the people , not become *slavishly* responsive
