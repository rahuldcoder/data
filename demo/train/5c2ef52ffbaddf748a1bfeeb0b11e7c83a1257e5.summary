-- this week , president @entity1 announced policy measures to enhance the surveillance of oil futures markets			1
the president stressed that the new measures would not bring down gasoline prices overnight , but implied that they would lower gas prices in the long run because more oversight would deter market manipulation			1
there is universal agreement on the need to prevent the manipulation of oil prices , but the premise of this proposal could not be more mistaken			2
there is no evidence that rising crude oil prices were caused by market manipulation , and there is no reason to expect increased oversight to lower gas prices across @entity27			1
this policy initiative confuses the increased financialization of oil futures markets in recent years with illegal activities such as market manipulation			1
market manipulation occurs when traders herd the market into positions from which they can profit , resulting in excessively high oil prices			1
there is no evidence that the bulk of the financial investors taking positions in oil futures markets since 2003 have engaged in such activities			2
more generally , the @entity1 administration is mistaken in attributing high oil and gas prices to the presence of financial investors in oil futures markets			1
a popular view among pundits and policymakers has been that the sustained oil price increase between 2003 and mid- 2008 could not possibly be explained by economic fundamentals , but must have been brought about by financial investors taking speculative positions in oil futures markets			1
recent research has not been kind to this hypothesis			0
a large number of scientific studies have failed to produce any credible evidence that high oil and gas prices were caused by the presence of financial investors in oil futures markets			1
for example , seemingly compelling and widely cited data regarding the relative size of the financial market for oil and the physical volume of oil being consumed has been shown to be misleading			0
all indications are that the financial market is smaller than oil consumption when measured correctly			0
equally importantly , studies based on financial data provided by the @entity77 shows that financial investors did not take the positions in oil futures markets commonly ascribed to them			2
for example , changes in index funds ' positions do not precede changes in the price of oil futures , but prices predict positions			0
nor is there a systematic relationship between commonly discussed measures of speculation and movements of oil prices			0
finally , price increases in commodity markets for which there are no futures exchanges are as large as price increases in the oil market			0
in fact , there are strong indications that recent oil price fluctuations were mainly associated with changes in the global business cycle			1
notably , between 2003 and mid- 2008 , global demand for oil increased faster than global oil production , resulting in a sustained increase in the price of oil			0
much of the additional demand for oil came from emerging @entity116			0
no nefarious speculators are required to explain this surge in the price of oil			0
indeed , oil futures prices responded to much the same economic forces as prices in the physical market notwithstanding widespread agreement on this explanation among oil market experts , policy makers have remained intrigued with the speculation hypothesis			2
the apparent reason is that this hypothesis seems to provide an easy alternative to less popular policies of energy conservation			0
in fact , the @entity1 administration 's approach to lowering gasoline prices is as impractical as the @entity138 proposal of bringing gasoline prices down by increasing @entity27 oil production			2
neither proposal recognizes that oil prices today are determined by the highest bidder in global oil markets			2
the unpleasant truth is that high prices at the pump are not likely to go away , short of another global recession			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

@entity1 announced proposal to increase surveillance of oil futures markets
@entity151 : rise in oil prices -- and gas prices -- is not caused by market manipulation
@entity151 : @entity1 's premise is *wrong* ; *swings* in oil prices caused by global business cycle
@entity151 : unpleasant truth is that high prices at the pump are not likely to go away
