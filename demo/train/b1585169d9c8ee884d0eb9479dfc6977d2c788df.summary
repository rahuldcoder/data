-- @entity1 may have given us the word democracy and many of the principles of civil society			1
but now it is " the sick man of @entity8 , " and the people of other @entity8 democracies are asking whether it 's worth saving with billions more dollars of their money			2
put crudely , their argument is this : so what if @entity1 slides ignominiously out of the eurozone ? goodbye @entity1 ... in continental terms , @entity1 is peripheral			1
it does n't sit on reservoirs of oil , and it relies on agriculture and tourism as money - earners			1
it accounts for just 5 % of the @entity27 's economic output			0
with the @entity31 long over , its strategic position on the edge of the @entity30 is not as important as it was			2
second , critics question whether @entity1 has the will or capacity to stay within the eurozone			1
in last sunday 's elections , the main @entity1 parties -- those that had promised to swallow the medicine doled out by the @entity27 and @entity39 -- were trounced at the polls			1
thursday , a third political leader was invited to try to form a government			0
@entity1 commentators predict no stable coalition is likely -- and new elections probable , just as a further $ 15 billion of austerity measures are due			1
two weeks ago , the governor of @entity1 's @entity49 , @entity50 , warned that unless the country stayed the course , there could be " a disorderly regression , taking the country back several decades and eventually driving it out of the euro area and the @entity27			1
" a majority of @entity1 -- some 70 % -- tell pollsters they want the country to remain in the eurozone			1
but a substantial minority have just voted for parties that oppose what they see as austerity imposed by @entity66			0
they believe the medicine is actually making the situation worse			0
this year , the @entity49 forecasts the economy will shrink by 5 % , after a 7 % contraction last year			0
that means fewer jobs , less tax revenue and more difficulty meeting debt obligations			0
third , is the endless bailout smart economics ? or does it just perpetuate the crisis , as new debt replaces old ? a confidential analysis by the @entity39 , @entity82 and @entity83 in february projected that @entity1 debt would still amount to 129 % of @entity85 in 2020 and could be as high as 160 %			1
the analysis , obtained by @entity87 in february , estimated @entity1 would need some $ 175 billion in financing over the next two years			1
some argue that so long as @entity1 uses the euro as its currency , it will never become competitive			1
research by investment bank @entity94 concluded @entity1 needed a real depreciation in its exchange rate of a whopping 30 % to restore competitiveness			1
compare its situation to that of @entity100 , which after a financial meltdown in 2008 thanks to its over-stretched banking sector , went cold turkey with a 40 % devaluation of its currency and let bank creditors whistle in the wind			0
now it 's started growing again , albeit modestly			0
@entity109 economist @entity108 has argued that @entity110 should be granted a sabbatical from the eurozone while remaining in the @entity27 , allowing it reintroduce the drachma at a deep discount to the euro and making its tourism industry wildly popular			1
@entity119 , head of @entity121 think tank @entity120 , agrees			0
the money being showered on @entity1 to keep it in the eurozone would be better spent lubricating its departure , he says			1
" the drachma will immediately depreciate , and the situation will stabilize very quickly			0
after a short thunderstorm , the sun will shine again , " he told @entity121 magazine @entity128			0
fourth , beyond the discouraging arithmetic , some argue that the @entity1 state is too dysfunctional to cope with its massive obligations			1
@entity1 has a tax system that barely works , recalcitrant labor unions and extensive graft			1
the latest corruption league table from @entity139 ranks @entity1 as 80th - along with @entity140			1
" for decades the political elite , mired in corruption and rent - seeking , has followed the path of wasteful spending and patronage , " wrote @entity141 , the mayor of @entity142 , in the @entity143 last month			2
@entity1 has n't privatized a single , state - owned industry despite repeated promises to do so			1
its social fabric is fraying and it has a growing problem with political violence			0
add to that , now , an unstable political order			0
and finally , if @entity1 is unable to get its house in order and uncertainty persists , the dreaded contagion effect will rear its head again			1
it 's a truism that markets hate uncertainty , and for the last year @entity1 has delivered it in weekly installments			1
the never - ending melodrama could worsen the psychological climate for other " olive - belt " members of the eurozone			1
negotiations on restructuring @entity1 sovereign debt have already left international investors wary of buying other south @entity8 debt			1
according to the @entity175 last month , investors have withdrawn $ 130 billion from @entity8 's sovereign bond markets over the past two years			0
on the other hand ... the opposing argument is that a " disorderly default " or even a managed exit by @entity1 would have far - reaching consequences for @entity8 -- none of them good -- and misreads the @entity1 mood			1
@entity185 , @entity186 at the @entity188 's @entity187 , has written extensively about @entity8 's financial crisis			0
" @entity1 voters have turned against the old duopoly of @entity193 and @entity194 , " he says , referring to the dominant parties of the past 30 years			1
" they are tired of crisis			0
that does n't mean they are against being part of the eurozone			1
they realize their savings would be wiped out if a devalued drachma took the place of the euro and that @entity1 banks would collapse			1
so it 's important to separate the weakness of the existing political parties from the issue of the bailouts and the eurozone			2
" second , there is no playbook for leaving the single currency , no rules governing expulsion			0
it was just never envisaged			0
a new @entity1 government , by persistently defaulting on debt repayments , might effectively vote itself out of the eurozone , but the process would be messy			1
@entity1 companies that take advantage of the single market would be badly affected			1
" any announcement of @entity1 's departure would wreck havoc in the markets			2
if @entity1 elected someone who wanted to pursue this path , it would be impossible to get back in at a later date , " @entity185 told @entity0			2
in addition , he says , there is no guarantee that excising @entity1 from the eurozone will relieve pressure on other members			1
it might simply refocus anxiety on the next most vulnerable state			0
" if @entity1 were to fall out , what would that say to @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 ? there would be a danger to the whole @entity8 construction , including the single market			2
the @entity121 often say " if the euro fails then @entity8 fails " -- and project @entity8 has been at the core of @entity121 foreign policy for half a century			2
" @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity242 are in the middle of painful restructuring ; just this week the @entity244 government announced it would have to step in to rescue the country 's third largest bank			0
the worst - case scenario : that the whole concept of an " ever - closer union " toward which @entity8 has been striving will unwind , one state at a time			2
" @entity8 will have difficulty forming a federation , if its first action is to jettison countries that are unable to make ends meet , " wrote commentator @entity263 in the @entity243 newspaper @entity264			0
let them eat carrots is there a way to muddle through ? maybe			0
but it will require a tilt from " austerity " toward " growth " to persuade the @entity1 that their suffering will not be endless			2
the basic choice may remain bailout or bankruptcy , but the bailout can be sweetened , as a spokesman for @entity27 economics commissioner @entity284 hinted tuesday			0
" we can do lots to assist @entity1 , and we are doing so			2
our member states , our taxpayers in other @entity8 member states of the euro area , are providing this solidarity , " he said			2
concrete action must follow , says @entity185			0
" @entity8 needs to show the @entity1 that they have reason to hope by staying the course , that it wo n't just be pain and more pain			1
there have to be measures to help growth , such as @entity8 investment projects in infrastructure and help for small and medium businesses starved for funding , which can be achieved through the @entity306			0
the @entity82 should continue to help @entity1 banks , so as to start lending again			2
" next year , @entity309 will be seeking a third term as @entity121 chancellor			0
if she gets one , analysts say , she may have greater freedom to tilt toward growth			0
" it would be a positive development if @entity317 [ the newly elected @entity318 president ] could hasten this development and create ' rewards ' for reforming countries , so as to remind @entity8 electorates the monetary union is not a ' suicide pact , ' says @entity185			0
it may be that even with a rancorous political atmosphere , mass unemployment and street protests , @entity1 is actually making progress			2
if ( yes , it 's a large if ) the next round of public spending cuts goes through @entity1 get close to achieving what 's called a primary balance , its revenue will pay for its spending			2
according to the @entity49 , the economy may finally stop shrinking in 2013			0
but 2013 seems a long way off , and these are the first tentative steps toward convalescence			0
anyone who has seen the movie " @entity342 and the @entity343 " will recall what happened to the man who insisted he was n't dead yet .			0

@entity1 does n't sit on oil reservoirs ; it relies on agriculture , tourism as money - earners
critics question whether @entity1 has the will or capacity to stay within the eurozone
some argue that so long as @entity1 uses the euro , it will never become competitive
