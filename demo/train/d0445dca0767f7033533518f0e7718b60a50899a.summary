-- @entity1 needs a miracle to win the league title this year according to manager @entity4 -- so what better way to start off than with the arrival of an angel			1
@entity10 , the @entity11 winger , completed his £ 59.7 million ( $ 98.7m ) move -- a @entity14 transfer record -- from @entity15 tuesday on a five - year deal , the club announced on its official website			1
" i am absolutely delighted to be joining @entity1			2
i have thoroughly enjoyed my time in @entity18 and there were a lot of clubs interested in me , but @entity1 is the only club that i would have left @entity15 for , " said @entity10			1
" @entity10 is a world - class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player			1
there is no doubting his immense natural talent , " @entity23 said after clinching the signing			0
" he is an excellent addition to the team			0
" but on the day the 26 - year - old arrived at @entity31 , the club suffered an embarrassing exit from the @entity33 at @entity34 -- thrashed 4 - 0 by the third flight side			1
goals from @entity37 in either half and a late double from @entity40 saw an admittedly understrength @entity1 team humiliated			2
the shock defeat comes after @entity1 failed to win either of its two @entity44 games following a home defeat by @entity46 and a draw at @entity48			2
the arrival of @entity10 is something of a coup for a club without the lure of @entity55 football given the @entity56 was recently described by his fellow countryman and @entity59 coach @entity58 as @entity15 's " best player			1
" he also starred for @entity11 in its run to the @entity63 final in @entity64 , but missed the semifinal win over @entity23 's @entity66 and the final defeat to @entity68 due to a thigh injury			0
however there are reservations over whether @entity1 should have used the money to improve other areas of the squad			0
" i think he himself is an excellent signing , " @entity75 , football writer for the @entity76 and the @entity77 told @entity0			0
" it remains staggering that @entity15 are selling him , given he tied their formation together last season -- but it sums up so much of the current @entity1 that a signing like that can still leave so many questions			1
" he is now the club 's primary signing , yet it has n't addressed the two primary issues with the squad -- central defense and central midfield			2
" at the very least , he offers pace , and trickery , and will give the side some of the thrust it lacked against @entity48			0
" but @entity1 also needs players further back to offer that platform			0
it 's difficult to have any quibbles with the signing of @entity10			1
you can , however , have quibbles with signing him without purchasing more necessary players			0
" @entity1 endured a disastrous time last season as @entity106 , the man who replaced @entity107 , was sacked just 10 months after taking over at @entity31			0
the club finished seventh in the @entity44 and missed out on qualifying for the @entity55 for the first time since 1995			0
@entity110 took over the reins following @entity106 ' exit in april before @entity4 was appointed in july			0
@entity1 have brought in midfielder @entity113 from @entity114 , teenager @entity115 from @entity116 and defender @entity117 from @entity118			0
but @entity10 is the marquee signing -- the winger who played such a key role for @entity11 in the @entity63 and @entity15 's @entity55 triumph			1
real paid around $ 60 million for @entity10 in 2010 following the player 's successful time with @entity125 in @entity127 football where he won the league title and the domestic cup on two occasions			1
during his time in the @entity18 capital , @entity10 became an important part of the side which won the @entity18 league title in 2012			0
he was also a key member of the team which won " @entity137 " -- @entity15 's 10th @entity55 triumph with a dramatic victory over @entity59 in the 2014 final			2
but his chances of first team football with @entity144 's side have been limited since the arrival of @entity146			0
the @entity149 , one of the stars of the @entity63 in @entity64 , joined the club last month in a deal worth a reported $ 121 million			2
@entity15 also completed the $ 34 million signing of @entity68 @entity63 winner @entity153 in july as it bolstered its midfield options			1
@entity10 will hope to make his @entity1 debut against @entity156 on saturday at @entity157 , with @entity23 hoping his team can hit back after its sorry start to the season			1
the previous @entity14 transfer record was set by @entity162 in 2011 when they paid £ 50 million ( $ 83m ) to sign @entity163 from @entity164 .			1

@entity1 has completed the signing of @entity10
**fee** paid for @entity15 star is @entity14 transfer record of £ 59.7 million ( $ 98.7m )
@entity162 's £ *50m* ( $ 83m ) signing of @entity163 was previous highest **fee** paid by @entity14 club
