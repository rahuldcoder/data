the @entity2 world 's relationship with media is -- like the region itself -- complicated and often contradictory and one that has been changing rapidly since the @entity7			1
while social media as emerged as a powerful new means of communication and news , two new surveys on media in the region have revealed its rise has not necessarily led to the demise of older , more established media			1
tv is the most popular ( but not most trusted ) news source last month , @entity19 published their fifth annual @entity20			1
the survey was the result of 3,000 face - to - face interviews with men and women aged 18 - 24 across 15 different countries in the @entity28 and @entity29			1
while 72 % of those polled listed tv as their main source of news , only 40 % listed it as a trusted source of information -- down from 60 % in 2011			1
" there 's a big family market in the @entity28			1
you sit in a living room with your parents or peers and watch tv			1
during @entity45 , it 's the biggest activity			2
but that does n't mean you trust it , " notes @entity46 , the ceo of @entity19			0
according to @entity46 , @entity31 is continuing to lose credibility , particularly as the region 's two biggest broadcasters -- @entity52 and @entity53 -- have each taken notably strong stances on @entity56 's political climate ; @entity52 allegedly pro the ousted @entity58 - president @entity57 and @entity53 in the anti camp			1

that two of the region 's most prominent stations are taking a pro- and anti- stance in countries such as @entity56 is one of the most discussed issues on the ' @entity2 street , ' " he says			1
@entity76 , a former journalism professor at the @entity78 's @entity77 , said he was n't surprised by the findings			2
" i think more youths are noticing that information is different depending on what media outlet you 're turned into , " he says			2
" also , the students were far more connected to social media			2
they were checking their @entity87 devices far more than turning on the tv			2
" social media has changed the landscape considerably			2
in 2011 , nobody polled listed social media as a trusted source of news and only 11 % rated online media			1
this year , 26 % said they trust websites , and 22 % social media			2
for @entity76 the increased trust in these outlets is n't necessarily a good thing			0
" i found many of my students had trust in anything : @entity106 , blogs , newspapers , @entity109 , tv			0
many would see a tweet and just assume it must be true			0
" internet freedom is valued , but so is regulation @entity115 in @entity116 also published a survey last month , focusing primarily on media usage in the region			1
the survey polled 10,000 individuals across eight countries on their media views , and found that , for the most part , @entity2 believe in freedom of expression online ; 61 % of those polled in the region agreed with the statement " it is okay for people to express their ideas on the internet , even if they are unpopular			1
" @entity133 citizens voiced this view most strongly , with 76 % agreeing with the statement			0
conversely , @entity133 were also the biggest proponents of curbing internet freedom ; 62 % agreed that the internet should be more tightly regulated in their country			0
across the region , half of those polled agreed			0
" there 's an enormous inconsistency there , " says @entity144 , the @entity145 and ceo of @entity115 in @entity116 , and one of the survey 's authors			0
@entity144 attributes the discrepancy to the region 's acceptance of constraints on freedom of speech			1

it 's blasphemous to have anti-islam material online , and there 's a general acceptance in monarchies that one does not criticize the leader			0
you can criticize the head of state , but not the emir			0
i gather there 's this acceptance that it 's the way it is			0
" a free media does not equal a trusted media some countries @entity144 surveyed were predictably cautious of their media			0
in @entity56 and @entity184 , only around one quarter of those polled agreed that news media in their country was credible			1
other countries , however showed less predictable results			0
in @entity133 , for example , where media is tightly controlled , 74 % believed their news was trustworthy			1
in @entity193 , which has more freedom of press , only 25 % agreed			0
" it 's counter-intuitive , " admits @entity144			0
he believes that , in fact , increased access to media , coupled with diversity , have a hand in shaping the results			0
" there 's limited access to media in @entity133 ; there 's almost a sense of gratitude for having web access at all			2
that could be one factor			0
@entity193 is also much more diverse , so you get more viewpoints , and with it , more controversy			0

two separate surveys *highlight* the @entity28 's complicated relationship with its media .
one poll finds that while most @entity2 rely on tv for their news , few find it reliable .
the two top broadcasters in the region may have *damaged* their credibility with their strong political leanings .
many living without press freedoms still find their media trustworthy .
