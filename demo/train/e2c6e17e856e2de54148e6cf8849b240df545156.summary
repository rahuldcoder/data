-- the wimbledon tennis championships provide two weeks of pure sporting theatre permeated with tears , tantrums , comebacks , upsets , joy , despair , strawberries and cream			0
so , perhaps the only surprise attached to the appointment of an ace poet to cover the tournament is that it was n't served up sooner in its rich 133 - year history			1
@entity16 has been chosen as top seed -- a baseline bard who will pen a poem for every day of the two - week grand slam , chronicling the sights and sounds of south west @entity23 into a series of soulful sonnets			1
a regular contributor to @entity27 and a self - confessed @entity28 obsessive , @entity16 is already salivating at the prospect of trawling the sprawling site in @entity31			1
he told @entity0 : " it 's just fantastic to be given such access to the place and the people			2
i 've already spent time there before the lines have been painted and in the museum , and it has been fascinating			2
i even got to sit in the umpire 's chair on @entity42 and had to pinch myself			0
" when it starts i imagine i 'll be wandering about in the background			0
i 'll have to respond to the things people will be talking about , like if a pigeon is shredded by @entity49 's racket -- not that i wish ill of any pigeons , or @entity49 's racket for that matter			0
" i will also have to touch upon the traditions like strawberries and cream and @entity56 , and also the new addition of the roof -- welcoming people to the @entity59			0
" the attention i 've had since it was announced just makes me realize how much everybody loves it			0
i 'm not the icing on the cake for @entity28 , but hopefully i can be one of the many hundreds of thousands on the icing that 's on the cake			1
" poetry has a permanent presence at @entity28 , the immortal lines " if you can meet with @entity73 and @entity74 and treat those two impostors just the same , " from @entity77 's poem ' if ' adorning the players ' entrance to @entity42			1
@entity16 's task is to follow in those feted footsteps and compose an original work for each one of the 14 days of @entity28			1
so where will he draw his inspiration from ? he explained : " i 'll be getting there early and experiencing @entity28 before people get in and the change when they do arrive -- and i 'll probably go and recite some poems to people in the queue too			1
" @entity28 has such a rich history to draw on too			2
i can write about the fact that in the olden days women had to wear corsets and the like , which meant their clothes weighed three times more than the men			0
" or about the 1905 champion , @entity97 , who caused a stir by rolling her sleeves up above the elbow and wearing a dress that showed her ankles			0
" there are also a bunch of racket stringers who sit in a little hut at @entity28 where the players take their rackets to be tuned to their specifications			2
" @entity112 , the @entity111 is going to be there for the first time since the silver jubilee in 1977 , when @entity116 won the women 's title , so there is enough to write about without even mentioning the on - court action			2
" @entity16 's poems will be available on the official @entity28 and @entity123 web sites , and he 'll be blogging throughout the tournament			1
he 'll also have his very own @entity126 page , meaning punters can embrace their poetic side by tweeting suggestions during the tournament			0
he explained : " i do a bit in my live show where members of the audience write a line of poetry on a scrap of paper and they always fit together better than people think , so i 'll be inviting people to tweet me some pithy lines and hopefully we can do the same thing			1
" @entity126 is limited to 140 characters but you may just be able to fit a couplet in there			0
" to follow @entity16 's poems during the tournament visit the @entity28 or @entity123 web sites .			1
