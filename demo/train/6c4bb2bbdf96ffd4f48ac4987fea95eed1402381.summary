-- @entity1 unveiled a groundbreaking new @entity3 laptop thursday — one with touchscreen capability , powerful chipset and an extremely high - resolution display			1
the @entity7 , available for order on the @entity10 store and shipping in april , features a 12.85 - inch touch - sensitive @entity13 screen			1
the resolution is 4.3 million pixels , which works out to 239 pixels per inch			0
( the average @entity17 laptop has about half that ; technically , it also beats the @entity19			1
) the @entity7 will come in two versions , both boasting an @entity23 i5 processor			1
the basic model is @entity25 only ; a more expensive model has the ability to connect to @entity30 's superfast @entity29 network			2
@entity1 claims a battery life of five hours on the device , which has @entity33 built into the browser and an sd card slot for automatic photo uploads to @entity37			1
those features can also be used offline ( uploads queued for later , of course )			0
the price , however , is relatively steep : $ 1,299 for the @entity25 only version , $ 1,449 for the @entity29 model			1
@entity1 was careful to emphasize that the @entity7 is n't for everyone			1
" this is for power users who live in the cloud , " senior vice president of @entity46 repeatedly told a select group of journalists at a low - key launch event in @entity50			0
having a touchscreen does n't mean that @entity1 plans to integrate its mobile os , @entity54 , into the device			2
but @entity56 hoped web developers would start making their interfaces touch - sensitive — so that content on the device would be indistinguishable from @entity54			0
" touch is here to stay , and i 'm pretty sure every laptop will have touch in the future , " @entity56 said			0
" using a laptop with touch seems strange at first , but your day - to - day browser experience starts changing			2
in our tests , users started replacing the touchpad pretty quickly			0
" the aluminum - coated @entity7 was designed and built by @entity1 , with help from other unnamed pc manufacturers			1
plenty of thought appears to have gone into the design : for example , there 's an extra laser microphone under the keyboard , complementing the two mics next to the camera , allowing the software to cancel out any noise you might make while typing on a video conference			0
" our goal was to have the hardware disappear , " @entity56 added			0
did @entity1 achieve its goal ? we 've got our hands on a @entity3 and will post a hands on soon			2
in the meantime , let us know in the comments — would you consider a @entity7 ? © 2013 @entity97			0
