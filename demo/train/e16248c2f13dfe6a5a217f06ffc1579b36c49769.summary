" i would like to make clear ... this will be my last term , " he said during a nationally televised speech at the end of a session of the country 's @entity10			2
the announcement came shortly after lawmakers re-elected @entity2 to a second five - year term			1
last year , @entity2 said that @entity3 officials , including the president , should be limited to two terms in office			1
he was officially elected president of the island nation in 2008			2

@entity2 took over from his ailing , older brother , @entity24 , whom he quoted liberally on sunday			1
" i quote : ' revolution is the sense of the historical moment , to change everything that must change			0
it is equality and freedom			0
it is to treat and treat others as human beings			0
it is to emancipate ourselves with our own efforts			0
it is to defy powerful forces in and out of the social and national context ... it is to fight for our dream of justice for @entity3 and the world , the fundamentals of our patriotism , and socialism , and our internationalism			0
' may this marvelous definition serve as a guide for the new generations of patriots and @entity3 revolutionaries , " @entity2 said			1
illness forced the elder @entity2 to step down after nearly 50 years in power			1
also sunday , lawmakers elevated @entity58 , 52 , to the position of first vice president , putting him next in line to succeed @entity2			1
he is the first member of the generation born after the @entity63 to reach the powerful position and stands in contrast to many of the octogenarian military officials who hold top positions in the government			0
@entity70 previously served as one of five second vice presidents and as minister of higher education			2
trained as an electrical engineer , he has a reputation among many @entity3 as a plainspoken problem solver			0
@entity2 spoke glowingly of @entity78 , saying his rise marks a " definitive step in the configuration of the future leadership of the country , through the gradual and organized transfer to the new generation taking over the main roles			1
" while not as widely known as other officials , @entity70 last month headed a @entity3 delegation that attended a large pro-government demonstration in @entity91			0
the event marked the day that @entity91 president @entity93 was due to have been sworn in for a new term			1
but @entity93 missed his inauguration to receive cancer treatment in @entity3			0
@entity2 also announced sunday that @entity97 , 68 , would assume the role of president of the @entity10			1
@entity100 had previously served in a variety of other roles , including second vice president			1
@entity100 replaces @entity104 , who was the @entity10 president for 20 years and often acted as the point person for negotiations with the @entity107			2
however , @entity109 's political future was clouded last year by the arrest of a top deputy on corruption charges			0
@entity109 will now lead the government 's effort to free five @entity3 intelligence officers sentenced to jail in the @entity107 , @entity3 officials said			0
before his formal televised remarks on sunday , @entity2 bantered with other high - ranking officials			1
at one point , he said that the @entity10 should change venues from the drab convention center where it now meets to @entity0 's @entity124 building			0
" it 's a jewel , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's true there was a time during the era of capitalism that 's where all the bandits met but not any longer now that its ours			0
" the @entity124 , a replica of the one in @entity134 , was previously the seat of government in @entity3 but has mainly sat unused since the 1959 revolution			0
@entity2 then asked how long it had taken to build the @entity124 in @entity0 during its construction in the 1920s			2
" a little more than two and a half years , " replied @entity141 , @entity0 's historian and member of the assembly			0
" and how long would it take to build today ? " @entity2 asked , referring to the cost overruns and inefficiency endemic to @entity3 government construction projects			2
" not less than five , " said vice president @entity148 , who fought alongside @entity2 in the revolution and now oversees government public works			1
@entity2 disagreed , saying the current government could not erect the same building in the less than 15 years			2
