the video appears to give us a rare glimpse into a police officer 's reaction after the fatal shooting of an unarmed man			1
officer @entity8 approaches a patrol car and collapses			1
fellow officers help him up , and he keels over the hood of the car , face in hand , sobbing			1
" i thought he was going to pull a gun on me , " @entity8 , an officer in @entity14 , @entity15 , tells one of the officers assisting him			1
since @entity22 teen @entity21 's death prompted a move to put body cameras on all of @entity19 's policeman , @entity19 will likely witness more recordings of the crucial moment when an officer decides to pull the trigger			1
it 's ugly , as a dash cam from @entity8 's patrol car reminds us			1
the video was presented as part of a coroner 's inquest into the april shooting of @entity39			2
a squad car 's headlights shine on @entity8 as he walks away from a dark driveway in the background , where he had pulled over a car carrying @entity39 , who @entity8 thought was a suspect in an armed robbery and shooting			1
@entity8 shot the man after he did not comply with orders to keep his hands in sight , dash cam video shows			1
when @entity8 reaches his fellow officer 's squad car -- with its dash cam also running -- he keels forward to the ground			1
he 's not wounded , but he sounds as though he 's hyperventilating			2
@entity8 had just learned @entity39 , whom he shot three times , was unarmed			1
@entity8 appears to sob when he stands back up , his voice squelching when he tells a colleague he thought his life was in danger			2
a colleague holds tight to @entity8 as he appears to cry in heaves doubled over on the hood of the car			2
another officer asks @entity8 if she should call his wife			1
it was the second time the drug enforcement officer had shot and killed someone			1
both times , dash cams were rolling			1
both times @entity8 faced an inquiry and the shootings were ruled justifiable , partly based on testimony analyzing the video , according to local media reports			2
in @entity39 's case , @entity8 said he was facing a suspected armed robber and shooter who he thought might pull a gun on him , @entity1 affiliate @entity79 reported			1
" i wish i just knew he did n't have a gun but i could n't take the risk , " @entity8 told a court earlier this month			0
" i could n't take the risk of him having a gun			0
i wanted to go home to my family and i wanted to see my son grow up			0
" despite the emotional breakdown -- and despite the inquest clearing @entity8 of wrongdoing -- responses to a message posted by the @entity14 police chief on @entity100 indicate there are plenty who feel @entity8 used excessive force			1
" he started out dropping f - bombs at the guy and then drew his pistol			0
he barely gave the guy a chance to surrender before plugging him three times at point blank range			0
this policeman is a murderer plain and simple , " @entity112 wrote			0
" even a blind man can see ( and hear ) that this was wrongdoing on the coward cop 's part			1
he was all jacked up as soon as he got to the car			0
he clearly knew who the guy he shot was and wanted to shoot him by the sound of his voice , " @entity119 wrote			1
one person even invoked the so - called loud - music murder trial in @entity127 , in which @entity128 was convicted of murder , despite his claim that he saw a gun and acted in self - defense			0
" it 's odd that @entity128 was convicted for murder in the first degree of @entity137 , even as his claim to self - defense against an imaginary weapon was nearly identical to @entity8 's , " @entity133 wrote			0
@entity8 and the @entity14 police had their supporters , too			1
" folks , when a cop stops you , it 's not about you			0
it 's about law and order			0
do what you 're told , " @entity150 responded , while @entity151 posted , " @entity153 said , chief ! ! thanks for all you and your @entity155 do for the @entity156 keeping everyone safe			2
" the other shooting involving @entity8 happened in february 2013 in front of a suspected drug house			0
a man reached for a gun in his pocket			0
it turned out to be a @entity166 gun , the @entity164 reported after the inquiry			0
that incident was also caught on video , and on it , you can hear @entity8 and another man escalating into a shouting match			0
" get on the ground now ! " @entity8 yells			2
" i 'm going to ( expletive ) shoot you ! " the male voice continues shouting at the officer , who keeps commanding him to get onto the ground			1
there 's a pulsating electric sound -- perhaps a @entity180 -- then a bang that sounds like a gunshot			0
" you shot him ? " a woman 's voice later asks			2
" he had a gun in pocket , " @entity8 answers			0
" he had a bb gun , " she yells			0
" i did n't know that , " @entity8 responds			0
the man later died of his wounds			0
opinion : @entity197 body cams : will they really help ?			2

an officer walks away from a suspect he has shot ; he keels forward to the ground then sobs
dash cams reveal the *intense* emotions of an officer who decided to pull the trigger
officer cleared of wrongdoing , though many expressed doubts in @entity100 posts to police chief
