around the world , aid agencies are dispatching teams to the @entity3 with one initial overriding objective : gain access to the areas hit by @entity7 and understand what has happened			1
the @entity3 government estimates that as many as 11.3 million people have been affected , and we know that at least 28 million people were within the storm 's path			1
a minimum of 670,000 people are displaced and 41,000 houses are damaged , with about half destroyed			1
and total casualty numbers continue to vary wildly , depending on different sources			2
getting a handle on a crisis on this scale is hard , but it 's made even harder when you 're working in an archipelago in a country that is relatively poor with weak infrastructure			1
that 's the challenge in the @entity3 , where we are facing decimated services on a truly terrifying scale			1
the images you have seen are only from areas we have accessed			0
worse may be around the corner			0
opinion : for @entity3 , despair and prayers organizations such as the @entity39 have learned a great deal from responding to past catastrophes , from the earthquake in @entity43 and floods in @entity45 in 2010 to the @entity47 tsunami in 2004			1
where state resilience and infrastructure are weak , the immediate concern , beyond first aid for those harmed in the first wave of destruction , is recovering , maintaining and reconstructing basic water and sanitation services			1
a cholera outbreak is always a threat , and other diseases such as typhoid are often the first killers to emerge			0
so the initial work is basic -- clearing debris and understanding what services are working and what are n't			1
the @entity39 will typically look to mobilize the local community by offering cash for work to clear roads and kick - start a microeconomy			0
this puts cash back in pockets so people can start to rebuild their lives , where they can , and rekindle economic activity			1
the second priority is to assess and reinforce health care systems			0
the government of the @entity3 has defined the typhoon event as a national calamity , and there will be thousands of casualties desperately in need of first aid			1
many survivors would be ill and reliant on a health service that the typhoon has destroyed			0
so , securing and providing medication for chronic conditions such as diabetes , which can quickly become life threatening if left without attention , is crucial			0
we are already hearing reports of closed hospitals without power and fears of electrocution if the power is switched back on			0
reports indicate that aid agencies will be able to access a robust pharmaceuticals market based out of the capital of @entity106 , but the supply of medical supplies and infrastructure tools will quickly dry up			0
no country can be fully prepared for disasters of this scale , so aid agencies will call for and coordinate international flights and shipments of the medicines and resources that are in the shortest supply or that have already run out			1
this process is expensive and requires serious financial support and logistical assistance			0
it will require donations from people who can afford to help as well as the offer of military - scale logistical assistance from governments that can help			1
when they lose their home and their family , people also often lose hope			2
where food has run out , electricity cut off and communications down , then looting , violence and theft become an immediate danger			0
the @entity39 will be assessing the nature and locations of these threats to alert the government and work with partners to offer protection services			2
we consider the vulnerability of women and girls to be front and center in our emergency response , as we know that in emergencies gender - based violence tragically increases			0
it may sound dull , but ensuring we are transparent and accountable to the communities we are serving is critical			0
if the people tell us we are n't serving their needs , we need to listen and adapt our approach			2
so we immediately set up systems to ensure that the people we are trying to help are part of shaping our response			2
like many disasters , the event itself lasted only a few hours , but the response will take many years to achieve what it must			2
so this is a long - term project			0
right now , we need to first save lives			1
at the @entity39 , we have launched an immediate appeal for $ 10 million			2
we will then begin the greater task of helping the @entity3 rebuild their lives and to be better prepared for next time .			1

more than 11 million people in the @entity3 are affected by @entity7

he says first we need to save lives , then provide basic water and sanitation services
