@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 go to the ballot boxes on monday to vote for their fourth president in as many years			1
unlike the last time they elected a president , the result of this election is a foregone conclusion			0
the former defense minister @entity9 is widely expected to win in a massive landslide			1
what remains , however , rather difficult to predict is : what will an @entity9 presidency bring to @entity0 ? @entity0 have gone to the ballot box more than a half dozen times in the past four years			1
the last presidential elections resulted in a large number of candidates emerging , splitting the vote and leading to a run off between @entity21 and @entity22			0
the result was close , leading to the @entity25 candidature of @entity22 barely triumphing over @entity27 's last prime minister , @entity21			0
this time round , however , there is no possibility of a runoff round , because there are only two candidates			0
@entity22 's former defense minister , @entity9 , who removed him from office after substantial protests almost a year ago , and the @entity37 contender , @entity38 , who came in third in the last presidential elections			1
the outcome is in little doubt -- @entity9 can count on the support of the state 's main institutions , various media apparatuses , the political and economic elite , and a substantial proportion of the @entity0 population			1
@entity38 will struggle tremendously -- if he were to win even 25 % of the vote , it would be a respectable showing in the circumstances			1
the question remains , however : how will @entity9 govern ? it is not entirely clear , because as yet , no official and complete presidential platform has even been released			1
his campaign team has indicated they do not believe it is appropriate to do so			0
nor has @entity9 himself been openly campaigning in rallies and so forth , with his team citing security concerns			1
that leaves room for a great deal of speculation , based on the few television interviews that the candidate has had and a few written ones , where he has constantly tried to lower expectations			0
what seems to be clear , however , is that @entity9 's most oft - repeated themes can be summed up in two : the @entity0 version of the " @entity73 , " and an emphasis on the likelihood that @entity0 will not " rest " as the economic difficulties are addressed			1
the first theme relates to a number of radical violent groups , such as " @entity81 , " which have been targeting police officers and military personnel over the past year			0
it also relates to the @entity25 , an @entity85 group that has been banned by the @entity0 government as a terrorist organization , although the designation has been disputed			2
thousands of their supporters and members are either on trial or detained by the @entity0 state -- the most famous trials have resulted in scores of death penalty verdicts being recommended by @entity0 judges			2
it is , however , unlikely such sentences will be carried out , regardless of an @entity9 presidency , even though he announced in an interview that in his presidency there would be " no " @entity25			2
nevertheless , the presidency of @entity9 , who is blamed by the @entity25 for orchestrating a military takeover last july , as well as massacres of their supporters , will still be regarded as illegitimate by supporters of that organization			2
@entity113 's @entity112 opposition may acquiesce to the electoral result -- but they could still prove to be an additional thorn in the government 's side , agitating for progressive change			0
that may mean that the polarization of @entity0 society will continue for the foreseeable future			2
regardless of the hopes of some , it is doubtful that the @entity25 , or dissent in general , will simply disappear			0
the second theme relates more to the @entity0 economy , which is in a deeply worrying situation			2
it may continue to deteriorate , but wholesale collapse does not seem to be on the horizon			0
@entity0 's new authorities can count on the support of several @entity138 countries , and the @entity0 military , as an institution , is expected to play a significant role in pushing forward on several projects designed to improve the @entity0 economy			1
the military 's top brass generally supported @entity9 's retirement , in order for him to run for the presidency , and for the time being at least , that institution will back him			2
be that as it may , however , @entity9 will become president at a time when the @entity0 public is more tired than ever			1
the last four years of instability have not delivered what that public expected , and while a significant proportion of it may give him a bit of breathing room in order to produce positive change , he will not be able to count on it indefinitely			0
if @entity9 does not tackle the weighty problems concerning the economy , security ( including security sector reform ) , and corruption , he should expect there to be a reaction			1
in a country where the majority live either under or close to the poverty line , and youth ( who make up the majority of the population ) unemployment is incredibly high , minute changes may not be enough to bring genuine stability to this country			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			0

@entity0 go to the ballot boxes monday to vote for their fourth president in as many years .
@entity183 says the former defence minister @entity9 is widely expected to win .
but he says what @entity9 will bring is harder to predict as his platform is *unclear* .
@entity0 need economic , security and corruption issues to be tackled , @entity183 says .
