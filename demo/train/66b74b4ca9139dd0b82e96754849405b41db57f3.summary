@entity0 -- in an era of entourages and media minders , rock - n - roll hall of famer @entity2 arrived to our interview alone			1
wearing a black and white graphic scarf draped over a long sleeve t - shirt and practical black flip - flops , she wandered in off the street , browsing the hotel art installation like any other tourist			2
but this was no casual viewing			2
strewn around the room was four decades of memories -- stunning black and white photos taken by @entity21 bandmate and one - time boyfriend @entity20			1
it took me a few minutes to realize it was her			2
she seemed strangely detached looking at her younger self			2
but then , it was a lifetime ago			2
@entity21 hit their stride when the lines between music and video were mingling			1
they made their mark in the space between punk , new wave and disco and introduced mass audiences to hip - hop			1
they were a fixture on the @entity0 scene , but that is a landscape that has changed literally ... and musically			2
when @entity20 arrived a short time after @entity50 , in his trademark leather and shades , he paused to look at the blown - up photo of @entity50 up on the top of the @entity54 observation deck			1
it made him emotional to see that building , now gone			0
neither could remember the exact date he snapped the shot or why she seems to be holding a folded bill			0
it was just one of the ghosts in the room			0
we talked about the clubs that have closed , music stores shuttered			1
songs now premiere on @entity69 before the radio or tv			0
you might expect the veteran rockers to lament this lost past			0
but @entity50 and @entity20 are surprisingly open about the change			1
while @entity50 has been quoted in the past as saying the internet killed music , she was much more nuanced in our conversation			1
" it makes it more important to tour , there is no record industry to speak of , but i sort of appreciate that a person can download a track they love , " said @entity50			1
@entity20 also seemed to appreciate technology 's ability to reach an audience			1
" it used to be a struggle to get yourself on television -- before @entity94 even more so -- now it 's completely secondary , " he said			0
" now you can just press a button and watch anyone doing anything anywhere doing anything			0
in unison they agreed : " the verdict is not in yet			0
" the new studio album may be called @entity104 , but both artists feel it 's forward looking , especially in the collaborations			1
@entity111 of @entity110 , @entity112 - based @entity109 rappers @entity113 and @entity115 @entity114 are featured on tracks			0
@entity20 , laughing , noted : " i think my ego is less pronounced -- it 's easier to take ideas from other people			1
" though they may be rock - n - roll royalty , they are incredibly down to earth			0
@entity50 , still striking , has a wry smile and a slight mystery about her			0
we joked about tv binge - watching @entity129 and @entity131 ( which was why he was running late ) and the difficulty of getting things done in politics			0
does @entity50 have a favorite song ? rapture and a little known track @entity141 , she wished she could play live			0
they tag team a conversation the way only long - time partners can			0
" we get along , " joked @entity20 when i asked how they have survived when so many other bands have n't			1
the best thing about touring ? " the fans , " @entity50 said without hesitation			2
the worst ? " being away from my wife and kids , " said @entity20 , who is married to actress @entity153			1
though people dismiss the potency of aging rockers , there is a history they carry that is hard to resist			0
when i asked if they had a favorite live performance , they an told amazing story about being in @entity168 on @entity169 in the 70s , the night the curfew from the @entity163 was lifted			2
the band may have a treasure trove of memories , but they are now 40 years on -- in their words , @entity21 4 ( 0 ) ever -- and looking to the future			1
when asked which musicians they admire , the reveal : @entity177 and @entity178 read more : the evolution of @entity180 read more : what @entity181 did next watch more : @entity182 discusses humble start watch more : @entity185 head embraces tech			0
