-- a @entity2 apartment complex is mandating that residents submit pet dna samples			1
why ? to check if any of them are abandoning their dogs ' waste on the property			1
" ninety - eight percent do what they 're suppose to do , " property manager @entity10 said of her residents with dogs , " but there are some that do n't and you do n't know who that is			1
that 'd be pretty foolish if they did that right in front of me			0
" @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity2 , says it is among a growing number of apartment complexes implementing @entity27			1
that 's a program that matches samples of unclaimed dog waste to dna collected through pets ' mandatory mouth swabs in the hope of imposing greater responsibility among pet owners			1
@entity10 says her violators will first receive a warning if caught , paying a $ 60 fee to cover the dna costs			0
however , if it happens again , it 's a lease violation and the offender will be forced to live somewhere else			2
" they have a choice to rent here or not			0
if you live in that community you have to live by those rules and regulations , " @entity10 said			0
" it 's a privilege			2
" she said she got the idea from a residential community in @entity53			0
@entity54 , director of franchise development with @entity56 , says the program is currently assisting rental complexes in multiple states , with increasing interest as far away as @entity61 and @entity62			2
the tests bought through @entity27 , a subsidiary of @entity56 in @entity65 , @entity66 , match the dna already captured to a sample of each pet 's waste			1
poop that is n't scooped can then be analyzed			2
according to @entity54 , apartment complexes that impose a pet deposit or fee on residents could potentially cover the testing costs incurred with the initial dna registration			1
the cost of the dna analysis each time a sample is tested could theoretically be paid through a fee on convicted freeloaders			2
it 's a service @entity10 admits to be potentially costly , but with more than 30 dogs on her property , some as large as a @entity89 , " it 's really not about the money for us , " she said , " it 's about having a nice place to live			2
" and reaction has been positive , she said			0
" i did have one resident that thought it was completely over the top , who 's not a pet owner , " @entity10 said			0
but after considering the possibility of stepping in a mess he himself did n't leave behind , " he changed his mind , " she said			0
@entity10 sees long - term benefits in the @entity27 system , saying it could reunite lost pets and owners , especially in the aftermath of a natural disaster			1
@entity54 says he remains focused on both environmental and human health benefits through the system			0
" it 's a huge problem with growing environmental impact , " @entity54 said of the waste			1
the @entity27 website estimates a single pet creates 276 pounds of waste per year			1
" we want people to be responsible and not leave things behind			0
down the drain means it 's going into your lakes , rivers and streams , " he added .			0

apartment complexes use @entity27 for residents who do n't always scoop
@entity133 is taken from swab of dog 's mouth
it 's then matched to a sample of their waste
