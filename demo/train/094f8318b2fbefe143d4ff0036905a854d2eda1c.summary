when the government shut down last year , rep. @entity0 , @entity1 , walked up to a fellow conservative a few feet from the @entity4 , and high fived him			1
now , @entity5 are so shutdown averse , even @entity0 tells @entity7 they should do everything in their power to fight president @entity11 's immigration executive action			1
everything except shutting down the government			0
@entity0 ' change speaks volumes about @entity17 thinking at a time when the party is weighing a response to @entity11 's order amid pressure from some influential outside conservative forces are pushing republicans to go once again down the shutdown route			1
" there is no reason to shut down the government over this			0
it would be bad for the government , bad for the country and playing into his hands in a way , " said sen. @entity29 , @entity30			0
related : the legal battle over @entity11 's immigration plan " nobody wants to shut the government down			1
i do n't know anybody on either side of the aisle with rational thoughts would want to shut the government down			0
so we start with that premise , " echoed sen. @entity47 , @entity1			0
" i would try anything except a shutdown of the government , " added sen. @entity50 , @entity51			2
the lawmakers spoke in separate hallway interviews			0
with a shutdown off the table -- the question is how can @entity5 respond ? the answer , according to many @entity17 congressional sources , is that they do n't have a lot of viable avenues for beating back the president 's executive order , which is expected to allow up to 5 million illegal immigrants to stay legally			1
there may not be great options , but there are at least some choices			0
aim for the budget the first is to use @entity73 ' greatest weapon -- the power of the purse -- without shutting down the government			2
a leading idea is to fund the majority of the government for a year , as planned , but carve out funding for immigration - related agencies and only provide money for those for a short time			1
one @entity17 senator , who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely about the strategy , told @entity7 that such a move would " give us time to come up with a proposal			2
" " he wo n't veto either of those , i do n't think , " the @entity17 senator said , speaking of the president			1
there are pitfalls in this idea -- not the least of which is getting the bill passed in what is still a @entity101 - controlled @entity100			0
but @entity17 sources admit a broader problem that @entity5 have with using the power of the purse to stop the president from enacting his executive action is that @entity73 does n't actually fund the immigration agency responsible for enforcement			1
@entity110 , the primary agency responsible for green cards and work permits , is self - funded -- paid for with customs fees			0
that 's why other @entity17 lawmakers admit they would have to put policy riders negating the president 's actions on appropriations bills , which would lead back to the short term problem of a government shutdown , since the president is unlikely to sign a bill that rolls back his own executive order			1
another option under discussion is to pass a spending bill in december , but vote separately early next year on a bill that would rescind any funds specifically for those federal agencies that carry out the immigration executive order			2
several republicans say they could attach this kind of a bill to cancel the money to a one authorizing another program the president supports , which would put him in a tough position to veto it			2
sue the president @entity17 lawmakers do believe they will have a good case to take to the courts to fight to the president 's actions			1
several @entity5 said a lawsuit should be filed immediately to attempt to halt -- at least temporarily -- the president 's plans , but they admit that legal challenge will drag out and should be pursued on a separate track than the debate over government funding			1
some say they that when the new @entity17 - controlled @entity73 takes over they will push resolutions formally rejecting and presidential executive order and admonishing him for it			2
the idea is that showing @entity73 disapproves will help give lawmakers legal standing in court			0
block the president 's nominees still another idea floated by some @entity17 members is to block some of the president 's nominations in the @entity100 in response to executive order			1
it 's unlikely @entity5 would refuse to vote on @entity173 , the president 's pick to replace @entity176 as attorney general , but they could deny votes on other key positions the president want to fill			0
correction : this post has been updated to correct which state rep. @entity0 is from .			0
