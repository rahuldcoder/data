over 4,400 solar panels compose the roof of @entity2 in the @entity3 , making it the largest solar - powered bridge in the world			1
the old @entity8 bridge was built across the @entity9 in 1886 , but unlike other bridges throughout the city , it also operates as a railway station to serve commuters from all the surrounding areas , while offering a stunning view			1
being the first station to span the @entity9 , the bridge has always had high demands on power			0
in 2009 it received a makeover : the wrought - iron bridge was dismantled and rebuilt to generate its own power using the sun. a new roof was installed , housing solar panels over 6000 square meters , which is enough to cover 23 tennis courts			1
on a sunny day , the canopy can produce up to a megawatt of electricity			0
the bridge reopened in 2012 and the installation of the array was part of a larger upgrading project involving the station as a whole to cater for more passengers and improve services			2
" it generates enough electricity to make about 80,000 cups of tea a day , " explains @entity40 , head of engineering at @entity42 who led the upgrade			0
the use of solar power now provides up to 50 percent of the energy needed at the station and is estimated to reduce carbon emissions by 511 tonnes per year			1
the increased production of solar panels worldwide , particularly in @entity55 , has brought the previously high expense of solar cells plummeting down to make designs like this more affordable			0
" it 's a wonderful showcase of how @entity64 can actually build something that 's significant , " says professor @entity60 , an expert on solar energy at @entity62			2
" this is the most powerful bridge in the world and it 's using solar power in @entity64 , not a country well known for its sunshine			1
" cities across the world are increasingly harnessing the sun 's energy , with landmarks as iconic as the @entity77 and @entity78 planning to incorporate solar panels into their architecture			2
if the gray skies of @entity82 can accomplish such results across the @entity9 , imagine the potential elsewhere			0
