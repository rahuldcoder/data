-- sooner or later , @entity1 knows the rabbit - ear antennas on his old - fashioned television will listen for a signal and hear nothing			2
@entity6 sets at a @entity8 recycling center last month			0
many analog tv owners are n't ready to switch to digital			1
the 36 - year - old from @entity12 , @entity13 , said he tried to convert his analog tv to digital but was turned down for a government coupon			1
he does n't seem to mind			2
" with the economy , i do n't have enough cash to do cable , so i 'm just really debating whether or not i really want to make that switch to digital , " @entity18 said			1
@entity18 will have four months longer to make up his mind after @entity24 voted wednesday to delay the end of tv 's rabbit - ears era			1
on june 12 , analog tv signals will end and only digital signals will remain			1
old televisions like @entity18 's wo n't accept the new form of broadcast			2
people with cable tv or satellite service will not be affected			1
the switch had been scheduled for february 17 , but @entity24 delayed the conversion -- which had been planned for years -- to accommodate people like @entity18 who had not been able to update their tvs			1
the @entity40 offered a program to help people buy converter boxes that make old tvs work in the new era			0
that giveaway did n't meet demand , though , and as of late january , more than 3.2 million people were on the program 's waiting list			2
more than 6.5 million @entity52 households , or 5.7 percent , were not ready for the crossover last month , according to an estimate from the @entity55			0
there 's been little made of the people behind those numbers , though , as media reports largely have focused on the mechanics of the switch and the politics of when and how it will happen			2
many of those who have n't bought converters are poor , older than 55 , rural residents or racial minorities , according to @entity55 's estimates			2
some of them told @entity0 they could n't afford to pay for cable or satellite tv service			1
while a person can live without tv , some of the late converts to digital depend on television for information and companionship			1
" i live here by myself , so it will be a big deal for me , " said @entity81 , a 42 - year - old from rural @entity82 , @entity13			0
" even just a couple hours a day of having that extra interaction , it 's a stress reliever for me			0
" @entity87 said she got a coupon to buy the digital converter box for her analog television as soon as they became available			1
she 's attached the box to her tv , but her signal got worse			2
" basically i 'm downgrading at this point , " she said			0
" i 'll go from having four or five channels i can watch on a regular basis to having one channel i can watch every now and then -- if at all			0
" @entity87 , who is a real - estate appraiser and practices kinesiology , said she ca n't afford satellite service because her business has dropped with the economy			1
she falls into a category of people who may lose their tv coverage with the switch to digital			1
it 's likely the result of a phenomenon called the " cliff effect			0
" while analog signals fizzle out over long distances , digital signals tend to stop completely at a certain falling - off point			2
" with digital , you get a great picture or nothing , " said @entity116 , spokesperson for the @entity117			0
some remote areas of the country could lose reception when analog signals stop in june , said @entity125 , spokesperson for the @entity126 , an advocacy group that has been trying to inform people about the switch since 2006			1
on the whole , studies show more people will get tv signals than will lose them in the switch to digital , @entity125 said			1
the @entity126 supports delaying the change until june in part because it will cause fewer people to go without tv after the change			1
" there 's no question that television is an important piece of the fabric of @entity52 life , " @entity125 said			0
@entity24 elected to delay the digital switch in part because lawmakers do n't want people to go without tv			1
@entity148 , a 64 - year - old from @entity149 , @entity150 , said he has not gotten a converter coupon yet and can not find the device in local stores			0
he said he will check back often , though , and hopes to be able to switch to digital in the coming days			1
like @entity159 , more than 12 percent of @entity150 households in the @entity156 and @entity158 tv market are not ready for the switch , making the area the least prepared in the nation , according to @entity55			1
being left out of the switch would be a big deal for @entity159			0
he is retired and says he spends a substantial part of his evening watching tv with his wife			0
" i just watch the news all the time , that 's all i want , " he said			0
" i get the weather , the news , what 's going on -- all of it -- i want to know it			0
" the annoyance of having to convert to digital may push @entity18 , the man in @entity12 , away from television entirely			1
ireport.com : ' you snooze , you lose ' @entity18 said he left a bad job as a local truck driver four years ago and has n't been able to find steady work since			0
he 's given up luxuries like cable tv , an internet connection and movie rentals to make ends meet			1
he said he applied for the free converter about a month ago but was turned down at least temporarily because all of the coupons had been given out			0
he does n't buy the idea that he needs a television to alert him about emergencies or severe weather			2
" i do have a radio and i also have a cell phone			0
if something 's really , really bad , someone can call me , " he said			0
" and i figure if there 's a nuclear war , it will be everywhere			0
someone will let me know			0
" if @entity18 eventually gets a free converter box , he 'll consider joining the digital tv world			1
but if not , he said wo n't be angry at the government for the delays			2
he thinks he might be better off without all that extra noise .			0
