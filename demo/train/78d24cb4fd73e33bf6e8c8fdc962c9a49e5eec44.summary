the @entity0 is one of the most influential small - business advocacy groups in the country			1
they battle against government regulation , higher taxes and , perhaps most famously , @entity7			0
and they do it all as the self - described " voice of small business			1
" but it turns out that the champions of @entity14 got more money last year from a group backed by billionaire industrialists @entity18 and @entity19 than any other single source			1
@entity0 and its affiliated groups received $ 2.5 million from @entity22 , a conservative advocacy group with deep ties to the @entity19 empire			1
of the five men that sit on the group 's board , four are current or former employees of @entity19 companies and one is a friend of @entity32 's			2
@entity22 gave the @entity0 $ 1.5 million last year , the biggest single contribution the federation received , according to tax records			2
the @entity19 - backed group gave three other @entity0 - affiliated group another $ 1 million , making @entity22 among the top two biggest contributors to those groups , records show			1
the big - money donations are raising questions about whose agenda @entity0 is serving , that of mom - and - pop businesses or the captains of big industry			2
@entity49 of the government watchdog group @entity48 said the @entity0 is " taking the name of small business in vain			1
" " the idea that @entity55 money in some way is going to help small businesses is laughable , " @entity53 said			2
" what they 're buying is the ability to help set the agenda			0
" and that agenda has included taking the lead on the lawsuit challenging @entity7 ( @entity0 v. @entity66 ) that went to the @entity69 @entity68			2
they also opposed increasing income tax rates on people making $ 250,000 or more , even though the vast majority of small businesses are n't affected by the rate hike			0
@entity0 spokeswoman @entity75 said the organization brings in the bulk of its revenue , about $ 86 million , from dues its 350,000 members pay			1
members , she said , set the group 's agenda			1
any suggestion to the contrary , is " simply not true			0
" " we do what our members tell us to do			0
we 've been doing it since 1943 , " she said			0
on taxes , the organization asked its members in 2010 if the federal government should extend all the @entity96 - era individual tax rates , 89 % said yes			0
in november 2010 they asked members if @entity99 should repeal the @entity7 and 93 % said yes , @entity75 said			0
@entity22 advocates for lower taxes and supports @entity0 's work on reducing government regulations , group spokesman @entity100 said			1
many of the group 's more than 200 members started small businesses			1
" @entity22 , many of the businesses that are represented -- and i ca n't prove this to you because i 'm not going to give you a list of our businesses -- but they are small businesses , " he said			0
" they are n't publicly traded companies			0
" @entity117 , a spokesman for @entity118 , said the company 's roots are as a small business			1
" @entity19 supports small businesses all over the country through our relationships with our vendors and suppliers and we support wholeheartedly the fundamental mission of @entity0 -- principled entrepreneurship , " he said			2
this is n't the first time @entity0 has taken money from big corporate interests			0
in 2011 , @entity0 took $ 850,000 from the nation 's top insurance industry trade group as part of a campaign to repeal a key @entity7 tax			1
the back - channel transfer by @entity139 to the @entity0 allowed insurers to fund a much more politically popular ally in the fight against a tax on health care premiums .			0
