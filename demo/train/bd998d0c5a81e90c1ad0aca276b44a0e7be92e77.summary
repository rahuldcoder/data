-- attention minions of colonel meow : we regretfully announce that at some terrible hour on wednesday - @entity4 , dear leader , feline overlord , and supreme dictator of the @entity8 , merged with the infinite			1
to mark this occasion of feline loss , we ask that all minions observe a moment of silent contemplation ... ... thank you for your kind attention			1
this moment has been duly noted on your timecards and will be deducted from your pay			1
yes , @entity20 is dead			1
and the @entity21 mourns the passing of a truly magnificent animal			1
an animal who struck fear into the hearts of lesser beings			2
an animal who became an icon			2
an animal who routinely pooped in his own fur			2
" bask , i say ! bask in the glory of my partially digested @entity36 ! " though the ever - scowling @entity2 may not have been quite as world - famous and instantly recognizable as @entity39 , he was definitely first			1
and , most of all , he was the scariest			2
you see , whereas @entity39 generally looked bothered and forlorn , @entity2 was proud , plotting and evil , as though he might actually murder a small human just for sport			1
while listening to " @entity44			2
" to the @entity21 world he was an " adorable fearsome dictator " whose toothy anger - face ruled over all mankind			1
not bad for a cat of humble roots			2
@entity2 's rise to power started in a roadside gutter -- sad , scared , and alone			1
and not completely dissimilar to how i spend my weekends			0
( things are weird at home			0
) eventually rescued from the mean streets , he was taken in by the @entity61 and @entity62 , and later adopted at @entity63 by a loving human named @entity65			0
who soon became known simply as " @entity67			0
" @entity2 's true rise to power began when @entity70 and her husband , @entity71 , began posting images of him on @entity74			1
almost immediately , he was a star , and @entity20 commanded allegiance from a growing number of faithful admirers			1
and though he did n't actually accomplish much during his reign -- save for countless naps and a finely - developed palate for @entity82 -- @entity2 did , however , leave this world with at least one true medal of honor			1
he holds the @entity85 for " cat with the longest fur			2
" in fact , three independent vets measured and confirmed his coat , which averaged out to 22.89 centimeters			0
that 's roughly 9 inches of furry greatness			0
now , not only was he the world 's angriest cat , he was also the fluffiest			2
so fluffy you could die			0
which , if those were his wishes , you most certainly would			0
but @entity2 also had a gentle side , which sort of reads like my profile on @entity101			1
he was scared of the things he coughed up			0
he liked to be held			0
and he enjoyed having his butt scratched			0
and , somewhat surprisingly , he also had an unexpected best friend named boots -- a golden retriever he lovingly described on @entity107 as " stupid			0
" but , mostly , @entity2 was fearsome			1
and for a brief , incredible moment in time , it was truly @entity20 's world			1
the rest of us just got to live in it			0
i chose not to wear pants			0
however , in november 2013 , it all came crashing down			2
colonel meow suddenly became ill and was hospitalized with heart problems			1
and only a couple months later , he was gone			0
@entity39 responded to the news on @entity120 : rest in peace @ colonel_meow			0
# @entity123 another @entity21 - famous cat , @entity125 , also expressed her condolences : dear @ colonel_meow -- you are without question the most regal feline i have ever known			1
see you in space dear friend			0
and space is exactly where @entity2 now looks down upon his minions , a proud and regal cat floating through eternity			1
while listening to " @entity44			0
" follow @ @entity138 on @entity120 .			0

@entity2 was an @entity21 - famous cat , noted for his mean scowl
@entity20 became sick in november with heart problems , and died on *january* *29*
admirers of @entity2 were known as his minions
