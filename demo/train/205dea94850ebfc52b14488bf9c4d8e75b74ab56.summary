the crew of " @entity13 " pose for photographers ahead of the animated movie 's premiere at @entity0			2

" he said : " to have your movie actually open it is really , really exciting -- and to be the first 3d film too			2
" the festival 's surprise choice , in the wake of the recent success of 3d pictures " @entity48 " and @entity50 ' " @entity49 " earlier this year , is perhaps the boldest message yet that @entity22 is being embraced by the mainstream as the format of the future			1
according to @entity31 , who is also chief creative officer at @entity57 , @entity20 's tenth film also marks a major shift for both studios			1

the heart - warming tale , which took four years to complete , is visually stunning , using @entity22 to make the screen like a window into the world of the film			1
" we really tried to use depth in the same we use color and cinematography , and that is to further the emotion of the scene , " said @entity69 of the philosophy behind the team 's use of @entity22 in " @entity13			1
" the computer animated drama showcases the strength of the format to immerse viewers in the narrative -- especially when it is in the hands of talented storytellers			0

" we were waiting 16 or 17 years to see it in @entity22			0
" the problem of 3d screens has been solved by digital cinema , and although the roll out of 3d - enabled cinemas has been dealt a blow by the economic downturn , exhibitors are continuing to install screens all over the world			1
@entity138 is also squarely behind @entity22 , green - lighting features from directors like @entity140 and @entity141			0
