-- in the midst of heated political campaigns and real wars abroad , it is noteworthy that two columnists writing for the most consequential newspaper in the world , the @entity5 , took a different tack on sunday and ended up in the same place : a discussion of sexual nihilism and the modern woman			1
they are on to something			0
@entity17 's column , titled " she 's @entity19 , " looks at @entity21 's " @entity20 , " a trilogy of erotic , bondage - themed fiction			1
@entity17 expressed surprise over the popularity of the books in which a 21 - year - old innocent girl becomes a sexual " submissive " of a rich , powerful 27 - year - old businessman			2
while we 're steeped in a so - called " war on women , " @entity17 wonders " why women are thronging to the story of an innocent who jumps into the arms of a @entity37 sadist with a ' @entity38 ' full of chains , clamps , whips , canes , flogs and cuffs , falling in love to the soundtrack of the @entity46 's ' @entity45			2
' " @entity17 cites the remarkable success of the trilogy among @entity50 women -- the contemporaries , allies and beneficiaries of the modern feminist movement			1
and yet , the narrative flies in the face of women 's progress			0
for example , a contract that the girl signs with the man stipulates that " the @entity64 may flog , spank , whip or corporally punish the @entity66 as he sees fit , for purposes of discipline , for his own personal enjoyment or for any other reason , which he is not obliged to provide			0
" if this is progress for women , what would regression look like ? @entity17 's colleague , @entity76 , reflected on a similar subject in his column , " the @entity83 , " on @entity81 's new @entity80 series " girls			1
" in this unglamorous , dull version of " @entity86 , " @entity81 stars as a contemporary , twenty - something woman playing second fiddle to the bizarre , dominating sexual fantasies of her boyfriend			0
her first sex scene opens with her back to her boyfriend , inertly and joylessly submitting to his commands			0
@entity93 recoils at the idea of this			0
he writes , " you watch these scenes and other examples of the zeitgeist - y , early - 20s heroines of ' girls ' engaging in , recoiling from , mulling and mourning sex , and you think : @entity104 went to the barricades for this ? " @entity93 goes on to grapple with @entity81 's loveless sex scenes and wonders whether today 's onslaught of pornography and easy sex has desensitized men to the point where they view women , to recall the words of an earlier day , only as objects			1
even the act of sex itself is boring to some men unless it is ratcheted up in some strange , deviant fashion -- all at the expense of the thoroughly humiliated and debased woman			0
in the act of degrading women , men are also degrading themselves			1
and the voyeurism , inspired by such entertainment , debases men and women even more			2
this is a parlous , dreadful outcome for both sexes			0
( as i have written previously , men in our time , particularly young men , are having trouble in many ways			0
) as @entity93 asked : is this what feminism fought for ? in the 1970s we were told to respect women , treat them as more than sexual objects and treat their humanity the same as ours			2
is any of this still true today ? the insightful @entity148 , author of the forthcoming book , " @entity151 , " wrote in @entity150 recently , " studies do indeed show that women are no more happy than they were in the 1970s			1
" @entity154 economists @entity152 and @entity155 confirmed this in a 2009 study that argues women 's happiness appeared to be in decline despite advances in education and the workforce			0
well , how could women be happy with what is described in " @entity20 " and " girls " ? take note that this disheartening and dismal tableau of modern liberated sex comes not from pro-family conservatives , who have been condemning this turn in our culture for some time , but from two stars of the liberal commentariat			0
@entity17 and @entity93 leave us wondering the same thing @entity178 did a generation ago in her song , " @entity181 ? " is there no alternative to the " @entity38 " and @entity81 's demoralizing sexual encounters ? yes , there is			1
consider one of the most well regarded writers of the @entity189 era , @entity190 , better known to us by her pen name , @entity190			1
in her novel , " @entity193 , " she says of love , " for what is love itself , for the one we love best ? -- an enfolding of immeasurable cares which yet are better than any joys outside our love			0
" in an enfoldment of immeasurable cares in a real and true love , there is immeasurable intimacy too , including a richly satisfying sexual intimacy that finds no equal or parallel in a callous and casual hookup culture			2
it is worth pointing out that this desideratum -- deep sexual satisfaction -- is found most often , as has been empirically verified over and over again , in what is often called , derisively , traditional marriage			1
given the possibilities and fantasies presented in " @entity20 " or " girls , " some of which have been so graphically laid out and laid bare in our oversaturated tv and internet culture , can it not be argued that what @entity190 described is the option most worth considering again , at least once everything else has been tried and found so painfully wanting ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			1

@entity230 : an erotic trilogy and a @entity80 series paint *discouraging* *portraits* of women
@entity228 : demoralizing sexual encounters debase both women and men
he says we should take a piece of advice from the @entity189 author @entity190
@entity228 : traditional marriage is the place to find true sexual satisfaction
