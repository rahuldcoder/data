the tragic news that @entity2 , an @entity3 woman being held hostage by @entity5 , has been confirmed dead has once again raised the question of how the @entity3 and others should respond to hostage taking			1
that the @entity3 has negotiated in the past with groups and states that have condoned and sponsored terror is beyond contention			1
but should it do so in the future ? and , equally important , should it try to impose or try to influence others who are considering negotiating , specifically the families of those taken ? these are tough questions , so let 's get the easy stuff out of the way first			1
there 's no question that negotiating with terror groups , paying ransoms , incentivizes these activities , undermines @entity3 's credibility , sets terrible precedents and encourages copycats and more terror			1
how could it not ? nothing in life succeeds like success			2
and whether it 's a legitimate business or criminal enterprise , if something is working , the tendency is to do more of it			2
as a consequence , and given the stakes , the official position of the @entity3 government is that it does not negotiate with terrorist groups ( even though as the nuclear negotiations with @entity47 attest and the recent opening to @entity49 , too , the @entity3 does engage with countries that have been designated state sponsors of terrorism )			1
the most obvious exception to the @entity3 government 's rule on negotiating was the @entity59 administration 's efforts during the 1980s to seek the return of hostages held by @entity64 @entity63 groups , famously revealed in the @entity65			1
and there was the green light given to @entity68 to release hundreds of @entity63 prisoners in 1985 in what amounted to a quid pro quo to win the freedom for @entity3 citizens on hijacked @entity74			0
but there have been other , more recent , examples			0
these include facilitating the exchange of @entity79 , a @entity87 national kidnapped by @entity80 in @entity81 in 2007 , for @entity82 , former spokesman for @entity63 cleric @entity83 , who was implicated in the killing of @entity3 soldiers in @entity86			0
and then , of course , there was the @entity91 exchange in 2013 for five @entity93 officials , a deal that the @entity96 administration insists was n't negotiating with terrorists , in part because the @entity93 is an insurgent rather than a terrorist group			2
( but as @entity102 has pointed out , the @entity101 has been designated a foreign terrorist organization )			0
direct or indirect , insurgent or terrorist , these are for the most part distinctions that do n't really amount to real differences			0
and if you push the argument too far , they make the @entity3 look inconsistent and hypocritical			0
but these are in the past , you might say			0
what about now , particularly in the wake of the threat from @entity5 and the beheading of @entity3 citizens ? well , the @entity119 government , despite denials , was reported by @entity121 to have succeeded in buying back kidnapped nationals from @entity5			1
in addition , four employees of a @entity119 nuclear firm were also freed after having been held by an @entity127 affliliate in northern @entity128 , reportedly in return for money , although the @entity119 government denied this			2
that said , the buying back of @entity3 from @entity5 may present even greater challenges , especially when @entity5 sets price tags like the $ 132 million it demanded for @entity137 , or as it proved in the case of the two @entity140 nationals and @entity142 pilot , that the group was never serious about negotiating			1
still , even given these enormous demands , should the @entity3 change its policy and try to secure the release of its citizens , most likely for money , when they 're in mortal peril , particularly if escape or rescue are n't options ? it is interesting that in response to @entity5 ' hostage taking , president @entity96 ordered a review of @entity3 policy on this issue			1
even though other countries , particularly @entity68 , negotiate and trade with terrorist groups , it is virtually certain that @entity163 wo n't change its official policy			2
but it should -- in the event there are real opportunities to redeem hostages -- look the other way , if not facilitate the efforts of private individuals or family members who can raise funds to secure the release of family members ? sure nobody wants to give in to terror and enable more hostage taking			1
but on the other hand , do we just write these @entity3 off as simply unlucky souls in the wrong place at the wrong time ? after all , if this was your son , father , husband , wife , daughter or sister , would that be an acceptable response from your government ? these matters raise serious moral and ethical questions that are excruciatingly painful to answer			0
the war against this kind of terrorism is likely going to be a long and painful one			0
and we may well have to wrestle again with some very tough choices			0
do we maintain a principled position against negotiations , discourage private citizens from their own efforts -- even threaten to prosecute them if they try to pay ransom ? or do we approach each terror - filled hostage - taking situationally and maintain some flexibility to see whether lives can be redeemed ? i 'd be in favor of the latter			1
giving into murderous terrorists is horrible			0
giving up on the lives of innocent human beings in the name of a principle when there might be real and serious possibilities of saving them is worse .			0
