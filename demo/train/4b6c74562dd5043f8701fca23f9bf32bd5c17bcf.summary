-- whether you 're into fashion design , the culinary arts or watching famous pop stars make and break the dreams of hopeful singers , reality programming offers something for everyone			1
but if the multiple series dedicated to families with up to 19 kids ( and counting ) have taught us anything , it 's that we 're fresh out of original content			1
marketed as " the future of fashion design shows , " @entity20 's " @entity19 " premiered tuesday			1
and despite mixed reviews , the @entity22 - hosted show manages an innovative feel by borrowing bits and pieces from existing series			1
in other words , if " @entity30 " and " @entity31 " were one show , that show would be called " @entity19			1
" " in 2012 , there are so many channels and reality shows out there , it 's hard to come up with a concept where everything is completely new , " said @entity33 of @entity34			1
on the new @entity20 series , aspiring designers try to sell their fashions to retailers , just like entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to potential investors on @entity49 's " @entity31			1
" similarly , the network 's other brainchild , " @entity52 , " found success by adding rotating chairs and teams to " @entity57 's " winning formula			1
( the model originated in the @entity59 as " @entity60 " in 2010			0
) " let 's face it , " @entity33 said , " after the judges turn their chairs around , ' @entity52 ' becomes ' @entity65			2
' each judge has a team			0
each team competes every week			0
... it comes down to which personalities you like better			0
" based on " @entity65 's " recent shake - up -- judges @entity75 and @entity77 and host @entity73 all got the boot -- it 's clear audiences preferred the likes of " @entity52 " mentors @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			2
boasting mentors like @entity89 , @entity90 and designer @entity91 ( in addition to featuring clothing buyers from retail giants like @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 ) , " @entity19 's " star power could be enough to attract viewers , said april @entity99 , @entity100 's senior tv editor			1
" ( the show ) does n't feel as fresh as it could , even though everyone is touting it as a fresh new idea , " @entity99 said			2
while @entity104 of the @entity105 said the show deserves a shot for it its " originality and conceptual pizzazz , " the @entity109 ' @entity108 wrote : " ' @entity19 is @entity20 's attempt to refurbish ' @entity30			1
' ... it gets old really fast			0
as in , halfway through the pilot			0
" " @entity19 " joins past and present fashion programs like " 24 hour catwalk , " " @entity117 , " " @entity118 " and @entity120 's short - lived " the cut			1
" but @entity123 's " @entity30 , " which aired on @entity124 for the first five of its nine seasons , remains a juggernaut in the fashion arena			1
" knock - off shows that are lame imitations usually do n't work , while innovation does , " @entity128 's @entity127 wrote in an e-mail			1
this could be why the many " bachelor " copycats , from " @entity134 " to " @entity133 , " have n't experienced the same success as @entity49 's long - running franchise , which now includes " @entity138 " and " @entity139			2
" " as stupid and silly as the show is , it 's absolutely the gold standard for reality dating shows , " said @entity33			1
none of the copycats found success , unless you include @entity149 dating shows like " @entity150 " and " @entity151 , " @entity33 added			2
" @entity149 's version ( of ' @entity153 ' ) is just a lot trashier			2
" " the best kind of knockoff show just uses an existing idea as a jumping - off point , " @entity127 said			2
" ' @entity52 ' succeeded and ' @entity65 ' failed because , while ' @entity52 ' borrowed from ' @entity57 , ' its format was new , different and interesting			0
and ' @entity65 ' was far too similar to what we already saw and grew tired of			0
" it seems , of late , there have been more green - lighted singing competition copycats than anything else			0
the @entity164 and @entity49 's forthcoming singing competitions , " @entity166 " and " duets , " respectively , are certainly variations of existing shows like " @entity57 , " " @entity65 , " " @entity52 " and " @entity170			1
" but do n't count the impending singing shows out just yet , @entity127 warns			2
" success has less to do with whether a show is a knock - off than how compelling it is by itself , " @entity127 said			0
" on some level , ' @entity57 ' was a knockoff of the shows that preceded it , like ' @entity179			0
' do n't forget , " @entity180 " featured seven or eight strangers living under the same roof for 17 years before " @entity183 " came along			0
" @entity185 shows are n't unique to reality tv , " @entity127 said			0
" back before ' @entity188 , ' networks were churning out ' friends ' clones			0
" as long as new shows continue to add unique elements to existing reality programs , it seems they 'll have a shot at ratings gold			0
after all , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .			0
