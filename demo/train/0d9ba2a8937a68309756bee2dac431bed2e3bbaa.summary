@entity0 -- president @entity2 told @entity4 leaders and immigration reform activists thursday that despite frustrations with the delays in fixing the country 's immigration system , he 's going to need them to have his back			1
after punting on taking executive action on immigration until after the midterms , @entity2 pledged thursday evening at the @entity14 that he will act on immigration before the end of the year			1
" the moment i act -- and it will be taking place between the november election and the end of the year -- opponents of reform will roll out the same old scare tactics , " @entity2 said			1
" and when opponents are out there saying who knows what , i 'm going to need you to have my back			0
" @entity2 was interrupted by one heckler that @entity31 newspaper identified as @entity32 , an undocumented immigrant activist , who shouted " we need relief now " and was escorted out by security			1
@entity2 emphasized thursday that he ca n't accomplish real , long - term change without what he called the " powerful " latino vote			2
" @entity39 , si votamos			0
yes we can , if we vote , " @entity2 told the crowd to applause			2
that rallying call , reminiscent of his 2008 campaign slogan , piles on top of @entity49 efforts to mobilize lackluster @entity50 who appear less likely to support @entity49 in november despite strong backing in recent cycles , according to the @entity53			2
" nothing i can do will be as comprehensive or lasting as the @entity56 bill			0
anything i can do can be reversed by the next president , " @entity2 said			0
while @entity2 pushed back his plans for executive action this summer and a bipartisan @entity56 bill on immigration reform last year failed to pick up steam in the @entity64 , @entity2 insisted that his administration has done a lot to benefit @entity50 in his nearly six years in office			1
@entity2 rattled off a list of campaign promises that he said he has kept : from confronting " the crisis of overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools " to fixing the " broken health care system that left one out of three @entity4 uninsured			0
" " the progress we 've made has been hard			0
sometimes it 's been slower than we want , but that progress has been steady and it has been real			0
we have big things together and we 're going to do more , " @entity2 said			0
and fixing immigration reform falls under that category of " more			1
" " fixing our broken immigration system is one more big thing that we have to do and that we will do , " @entity2 said .			1
