" in one of the most high - profile recent incidents , 47 passengers spent nearly six hours overnight on a @entity94 , @entity93 , tarmac in august , with only pretzels to eat			1
" we were not offered food			0

@entity14 said in august that a @entity109 representative improperly refused requests by the captain and crew to let passengers off the plane			2
@entity109 , based in @entity119 , @entity93 , and owned by @entity120 , was the only carrier able to assist @entity121 on its way from @entity123 , @entity61 , to @entity124 , @entity93 , after it was diverted because of strong thunderstorms , @entity14 said			0
