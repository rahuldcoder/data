@entity0 -- @entity2 went on a @entity4 news channel on monday to discuss where stock markets were heading			1
by tuesday he was an @entity6 sensation			1
was it that he said , as someone who bets against markets rising , that he " goes to bed every night dreaming of a recession ? " was it that he said investment bank @entity14 ruled the world and not governments ? or was it that bloggers started to ask if he was just a " fake trader " who duped the media ? take your pick			1
but @entity2 caused a stir by saying what many people think those in the markets think anyway -- it 's ok to make money out of falling markets and there is no reason not to prepare for that			1
he certainly thinks the markets will crash again and people should be prepared for that , and that the average person should take steps now to protect their assets , or be prepared to lose their investments			1
there is nothing wrong with giving that kind of advice , if that is what you think will happen			0
it 's just unlikely you would hear that from an established player from a bank that is looking for clients			1
still , it was worth hearing more from @entity2 and to find out if he really believes what he said , if he understood the stir around him and whether he is in fact a trader			1
@entity1 brought him in , and i asked him all that			0
firstly , @entity2 is an amateur trader using his own money ( as a " hobby " , he has told other media ) and he 's not registered with the @entity62 to trade other people 's money			1
he does n't claim otherwise , but there was a feeling after his first interview that he was some sort of suit from the @entity70 or @entity71 giving sage advice to his clients			2
he does or can have other clients though			2
his website calls him a speaker and trainer of others who want to trade			0
in my interview , @entity2 said he does trade being prepared for a recession , but that as a " human being you do n't want it			1
as a trader you think differently			2
you 're going to have volatile ... conditions to make money in that market			2
" he also said he was a religious man			0
he was also clearly nervous about the whole affair and was undecided for an hour to whether he should actually sit on our set for the interview			0
he said no a few times , before we sat down			0
" the question is , why are they paying attention to this ? " he asked			0
" in my opinion somebody out there does n't want my voice to be heard and they want to attack me and damage me			0
" he talked of the ' @entity106 ' being desperate to keep people like him from talking about the coming economic storm			1
he admits there may be a book in the works , but one that focuses on traders whom he admires			0
when i asked him if he was for real , he said he would not say things about the markets he did not truly believe			0
when i asked him if he is a member of the so - called " @entity118 " who have faked tv interviews in the past , he would not say yes or no. " let people believe what they want to , " he said			2
to my mind , he should have been touted up front as a guy who has strong opinions on the markets , but certainly not as a ' trader ' or " investment adviser " in the classic sense			2
that does not make his view any more or less valid but , with that preamble , i do n't think it would have gone viral .			0
