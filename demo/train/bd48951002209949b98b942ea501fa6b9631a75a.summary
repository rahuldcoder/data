@entity0 -- when @entity4 's most successful homegrown movie went on international release last month , hopes were high that the slapstick comedy , which has drawn comparisons with " @entity8 , " would blaze a trail for @entity11 - language cinema			1
but " lost in @entity22 , " which picked up the highest grossing film at @entity0 's @entity14 on monday night , flopped outside mainland @entity4 -- only collecting $ 57,000 in the @entity16 and $ 72,000 in @entity0 , according to figures from consultancies @entity18 and @entity21 - based @entity20			1
the film earned $ 202 million in @entity4 , making the unexpected hit the most profitable movie ever after @entity28 extravaganza " avatar			0
" " we heard that it is not doing well overseas , or could be considered a failure , due to the cultural differences , " @entity20 's @entity29 told @entity1			1
@entity4 's movie market is the world 's second largest , in terms of box office takings , but its films are a hard sell for international audiences			1
poor marketing , a lack of recognizable stars and plot lines and humor that get muddled in translation weigh against @entity11 films and it 's a trend that 's not improving despite the country 's thriving movie industry			1
while @entity11 - language films have never been mainstream viewing for @entity55 - speaking audiences , a decade ago titles such as " @entity49 , " " hero " and " @entity51 " captured the imagination of movie buffs worldwide			1
today , according to industry players at @entity0 's @entity61 trade fair this week that accompanies the @entity14 , it is getting harder to sell @entity11 films , even in markets with a shared language and culture such as @entity66			1
" the enthusiasm created by " @entity49 " is no longer there			0
we are starting more or less from scratch -- whether and how we can rebuild the international market for @entity11 language films , " said @entity71 , who is charge of international sales for @entity11 studio @entity74			2
part of the reason is stronger local - language film production in places like @entity66 , @entity22 and @entity81 , said @entity82 , a @entity66 film producer and distributor			2
@entity82 said that he made more money from the five locally made movies he released in the city state last year than from the 16 @entity11 - language titles he distributed			1
@entity88 , president of @entity89 , the main distributor of @entity91 films in @entity92 , says that @entity11 martial arts movies and action flicks , with their simple stories and visual effects , play well with @entity16 audiences but these films are no longer being made in such great numbers as @entity11 moviegoers seek out lighter fare			1
" films that are doing really , really well in @entity4 are your romantic comedies and your fantasies that are really difficult to translate over to the @entity16 , " she said			2
" there is a lot of political humor and cultural differences that @entity16 do n't understand			1
" arbitrary censorship rules make @entity11 films harder to market			0
some genres , like horror , that are popular internationally are frowned upon in @entity4 and officials have the final say on release dates making the advance marketing materials and trailers necessary for an international theatrical release harder to handle			2
@entity4 also lacks a new generation of globally bankable stars to replace the likes of @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , who made their name in @entity0 action movies of the 1980s and 1990s before moving onto @entity28			2
by contrast , today 's young actors are making so much money in @entity4 that they have little incentive to head west			0
" you 're an a plus plus star in @entity4 but outside you are nobody			0
psychologically , you have to overcome these hurdles , " said @entity71			0
of course , given the size and profitability of @entity4 's market , in some respects , it matters little that its movies do n't perform well overseas or that its stars are n't household names			0
@entity147 has a thriving movie industry but @entity149 hits only find a niche market outside the country			0
however , @entity21 is becoming more assertive in its attempts to project its own view of the world and looks at the global reach and appeal of @entity16 films and television shows with envy			0
many people believe @entity4 would like to see its movie industry become a force to be reckoned with on the silver screen			1
" i think they want ( their film business ) to expand internationally , " added @entity71			0
" but despite that intention , we 're in a business where the product matters a lot more than in a lot of other industries			0
we 're not mass producing something that is easy to replicate			0

@entity11 - language movies a hard sell to international audiences
biggest *domestic* hit , lost in @entity180 , flopped in @entity16
*obstacles* *include* poor marketing , lack of stars and cultural differences
