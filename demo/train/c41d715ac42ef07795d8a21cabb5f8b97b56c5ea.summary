-- when @entity2 and @entity3 walk out onto the pitch at the @entity5 for saturday 's @entity7 final , it will mark the culmination of a competition rightly regarded as the finest -- and the hardest to win -- in club football			1
some of the greatest teams in the world have fallen by the wayside in race for the prize : @entity17 's @entity16 and @entity19 's @entity18 , to name but two			2
it was also the last bow for @entity21 , arguably the greatest coach in charge of the greatest team of the modern era , who left @entity26 shortly after @entity7 semifinal defeat against @entity2			1
but it is much more than a match between the two best teams in @entity31			2
it is also a clash of ideas over how football should best be run , and whether money and the success that statistically follows should trump the interests of the supporters			2
@entity3 vs. @entity2 : click here to see the finalists ' vital statistics on one hand you have @entity2 , a club which has benefited most from the financial liberalism of @entity47 football , an economic boom that followed the breakaway of the @entity50 two decades ago			1
@entity47 's laissez - faire economic approach meant that a young , unknown @entity53 oligarch who had only recently fallen in love with the beautiful game could purchase a club he had never visited and pump in hundreds of millions of dollars to secure trophies and league titles			1
ticket prices rocketed as the game was gentrified , but @entity2 tasted real domestic success , winning three league titles , four @entity63 and two @entity64			1
on the other side is @entity3			1
derided as " @entity66 " by some supporters of its @entity69 rivals due to the @entity72 team 's star - studded squad , it is still governed by the fan ownership model prevalent in @entity74			1
the " 50 +1 " rule prevents rich foreign and domestic businessmen from taking over clubs			1
instead , the fans own the majority of the club ( at least 50 % plus one , hence the title )			1
it keeps ticket prices low , and preserves the country 's football culture while ensuring the stadiums are full			2
@entity87 economics though the cheapest ticket for a top - grade match in @entity91 may well cost less than $ 20 -- compared to over $ 80 at @entity2 -- @entity3 , and @entity74 clubs in general , have enjoyed far less success in @entity31 over the past decade compared to their @entity47 counterparts			1
" in @entity47 , the change to football mirrored the wider free - market approach to business and the economy generally , " argues @entity96 , a journalist for @entity98 newspaper @entity97 and a staunch supporter of the @entity74 model of ownership			1
" state - owned businesses were privatized , and the football clubs were bought , floated on the stock market or sold on , and the few people who owned the shares made a great deal of money for themselves			1
ticket prices have risen by around 1,000 % since			0
" @entity74 football is flourishing with the highest crowds in @entity31 and @entity3 in the final			1
yet they had no similar money - obsessed change to the way they had always done things			0
@entity3 has 13,500 standing places , at € 15 ( $ 20 ) each , for top games			1
" that is a great beacon for the collective way of running football , and gives the lie to the @entity50 argument that selling the clubs to overseas buyers , making them available for people to profit from , and unleashing ticket prices to maximize income is a necessary basis for success			1
" @entity50 revolution the introduction of the @entity50 into @entity47 football in 1992 transformed everything			0
before then , @entity47 football was dying under the weight of hooliganism and indifference			0
the 1989 @entity146 tragedy , where 96 @entity148 fans standing during a match were crushed to death , also had a huge impact			1
the tragedy led to the @entity153 , which recommended all - seater stadiums be made compulsory			0
in a stroke football found itself rebranded , with a new source of income thanks to @entity160 's pioneering purchase of the @entity47 game 's television rights			0
but there was no mechanism to stop the rise of ticket prices to help pay for this bright new era of top - class players being paid six - figure weekly salaries			0
nor was there any true barrier to who could own a club			0
like any other business in the @entity98 , a football team could be bought and sold by anyone who could borrow enough money			0
the global popularity made the @entity50 popular to global businessmen and after @entity2 was sold to @entity182 , the floodgates opened			1
@entity183 , which last weekend won the @entity47 title for the first time in 44 years , was bought in 2008 by @entity186 , a member of the @entity188 royal family			0
he in turn bought the club from former @entity192 prime minister @entity191			0
across the city , @entity18 was sold to the @entity201 family , owners of the @entity196 's @entity195 , in a leveraged buyout -- essentially by borrowing money they did n't have			0
currently half of the @entity50 's 20 teams are in foreign hands attracted both to its popularity and also the huge numbers involved			0
take the @entity50 's latest figures			0
as many as five billion people watched the 2010 - 2011 season but it is the prize money that is even more surprising			0
according to the @entity211 blog @entity183 took home over £ 60 million ( close to $ 100 million ) for the season , with over half of that figure is in mandatory payments from tv rights			2
the bottom team , @entity218 , still secured £ 39.1 million ( $ 61.9 million )			0
the upside of money not everyone sees the downside of the glut of cash that has flowed into the @entity47 game			0
" because of fan influence , fans have prevented ticket prices from rising in @entity74 and they are 50 % lower than in @entity47 , " argues professor @entity226 , co-author of the book " @entity228			2
" " but although tickets prices are twice as high ( in @entity47 ) almost exactly the same amount of people go to watch , and way more people watch second and third - tier football than in @entity74			0
the money gets largely spent on players			0
" the money does not go into the pockets of fat cats as the clubs make no money			2
@entity47 pays way higher wages than in @entity74			0
you ask @entity183 fans what they think about large ticket prices , they 'd be quite happy			2
you get more expensive players and far better performance			0
" @entity226 points to @entity47 clubs ' relative success against @entity74 sides in the @entity7 over the past decade			1
@entity47 teams have won 36 matches of 68 total encounters , @entity74 teams just 16			0
" @entity74 fans complain bitterly that their teams are not competitive in @entity31 because other teams spend more money than they do , " he says , adding that financial transparency is also improved			2
" i 've got 95 % of the published accounts in @entity47 between 1984 to 2010 -- 3,200 sets of accounts			0
in @entity74 , you just have to trust those running the club			0
" a level playing field ? not all @entity74 clubs are governed by the " 50 +1 " rules			2
@entity275 and @entity276 are both owned by corporations -- @entity278 and the pharmaceutical giant @entity276 -- while @entity279 has been bankrolled by a @entity74 billionaire who officially owns a minority stake but whose money makes the club 's continued presence in the @entity69 almost entirely dependent on him			1
and many @entity74 soccer fans would recoil in laughter at the thought that @entity3 is somehow the club of the people			1
" it is not so much the ownership structure , it is that they are the superpower abusing their position , arrogant and systematically weakening all the other teams by buying the best players , " explains @entity0 contributor and @entity291 correspondent @entity290			2
" maybe the best comparison is with @entity18 10 years ago , before the @entity300			0
they had a tremendous supporter base ( @entity3 boasts a fan base of over nine million in @entity74 alone ) and there was hatred from them because of their success			1
" it ( the ' 50 +1 ' rule ) is good , it has symbolic value and does stop excess			0
but it does n't really stop people who really want to get involved and it allows for exceptions which angers clubs			2
it is not the promised land			0
" partial proof of this can be found in the remarkable success both clubs have in generating revenue			2
although @entity3 is 82 % owned by fans ( compared to 0 % cent at @entity2 ) , according to the 2012 @entity3 made £ 71.6 million ( $ 113 million ) more in revenue last year than @entity2			1
@entity3 also has a brand new , state - of - the - art , 70,000 - capacity stadium and can afford to sign top internationals such as @entity326 , @entity327 and @entity328			1
winner takes all ? both clubs made it to the final of the @entity7 , but will whoever wins truly prove which model is best ? " i think a victory for @entity3 is definitely a victory for the supporter - owned model of a club , " says @entity336 " ( @entity74 clubs have ) standing areas and affordable tickets , so young people and poorer people from all sections of society can still support football , as they have done since the game began -- until 1992 in @entity47			1
" of course , if @entity2 fans are celebrating on saturday , they would beg to differ			1
