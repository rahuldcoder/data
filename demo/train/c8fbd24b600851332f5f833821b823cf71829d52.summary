-- the head of the @entity2 denied tuesday that the @entity3 collected telephone and e-mail records directly from @entity7 citizens , calling reports based on leaks by @entity10 " completely false			1
" " to be perfectly clear , this is not information that we collected on @entity7 citizens			1
it represents information that we , and our @entity21 allies , have collected in defense of our countries and in support of military operations , " army gen. @entity14 , the @entity2 director , told a @entity16 committee reviewing the agency 's surveillance activities			1
the statement by @entity14 before the @entity27 came as a number of lawmakers called for changes to the way intelligence is collected			0
the hearing , billed as a discussion of potential changes to the 35 - year - old @entity36 , commonly known as @entity36 , follows a report by the @entity39 magazine @entity38 that the @entity2 monitored @entity39 chancellor @entity41 's cell phone			2
some reports also suggest the @entity3 carried out surveillance on @entity45 and @entity46 citizens			1
it was the latest in a series of allegations that stem from disclosures given to news organizations by @entity10 , the former @entity2 contractor who describes himself as a whistle - blower			2
rocky relations the allegations have rocked @entity3 - @entity7 relations with a number of countries calling for investigations			1
@entity39 has threatened to cut off the ability of the @entity3 to track bank transfers associated with terror groups			2
as the nation 's spy chiefs testified , two ranking lawmakers from opposing parties introduced bills that call for greater transparency and oversight of the @entity2 's surveillance programs			2
but during the hearing , @entity27 chairman @entity72 said collecting foreign intelligence was important to protecting @entity3 and allies from terrorism			1
" every nation collects foreign intelligence			0
that is not unique to the @entity3 , " said @entity72 , @entity79			1
" what is unique to the @entity3 is our level of oversight , our commitment to privacy protections , and our checks and balances on intelligence collection			1
" @entity14 said media outlets misinterpreted documents that were leaked			1
he said the @entity2 legally collected metadata from some phone calls , and the rest of the metadata came from @entity3 allies			1
he said @entity7 intelligence services collected phone records in war zones and other areas outside their borders and shared them with the @entity2			1
@entity14 vigorously defended the agency 's intelligence gathering activities , saying it has saved lives " not only here but in @entity7 and around the world			2
" ' fundamental given ' director of national intelligence @entity109 said that trying to determine the intentions of foreign leaders -- by getting close to them or getting their communications -- is a " fundamental given " among intelligence services , and one of the first things he learned in his 50 - year intelligence career			1
asked by @entity72 if he believes @entity3 allies conducted espionage activities against @entity3 leaders , @entity109 said , " absolutely			1
" @entity10 's revelations about @entity3 intelligence - gathering activities have been " extremely damaging , " @entity109 said			1
but , he added , the activities themselves have been lawful , and " rigorous oversight " has been effective			0
top senator : @entity128 did n't know of @entity3 spying on @entity39 's leader even so , @entity109 admitted there have been mistakes			1
" we do not spy on anyone except for valid foreign intelligence purposes and we only work within the law			0
now , to be sure , on occasion , we 've made mistakes -- some quite significant , " @entity109 said			2
" but these are usually caused by human error or technical problems and , whenever we have found mistakes , we 've reported , addressed and corrected them			0
" but it is those mistakes that have prompted calls for reform , including from a ranking member of the @entity27			0
@entity36 " must be reformed " to improve transparency about and restore the public 's confidence in the @entity3 ' intelligence gathering activities , @entity151 , @entity152 , said			2
" we must improve transparency , privacy protections and thereby restore the public 's confidence			0
" yet , the reforms must preserve the intelligence community 's abilities to help protect the nation , he said			0
@entity151 said authorities were considering a proposal to require a declassification review of any @entity165 decision order or opinion " to improve transparency without threatening sources and methods			0
" the @entity165 grants or refuses surveillance rights requests from @entity3 government agencies			2
meanwhile , sen. @entity171 , @entity172 , and rep. @entity173 , @entity174 , introduced legislation to limit the @entity2 's collection and analysis of cell phone calls and emails			2
it was an about - face for the two men , who were the leading authors of the @entity182 in the wake of the september 11 attacks			0
reporting mistakes @entity14 , the @entity2 director , said that of the billions of records of personal data collected last year by the agency , just 288 of them were reviewed			1
and technical safeguards exist to ensure that the data are not available to non-authorized personnel , he said			0
only 22 people at @entity2 are authorized to look at certain phone numbers , he said , and about 30 are authorized to look into the database that contains those numbers			2
referring to the unauthorized release of documents about the @entity2 's activities , he said , " nothing that has been released has shown that we are trying to do something illegal or unprofessional ; when we find a mistake , a compliance issue , we report it to this committee , to all our overseers , and we correct it			1
" opinion : does @entity128 still have faith in @entity210 ? in his testimony tuesday , @entity109 noted that he had ordered the declassification of a series of documents in recent months to inform the public debate on the matter , and would continue to do so			1
" these documents let our citizens see the seriousness , the thoughtfulness and the rigor with which the @entity36 court exercises its responsibilities , " he said , adding that the @entity2 comprises " honorable people			1
" though changes must be made , he urged lawmakers to " remain mindful of the potential long - term impact of overcorrecting			0
" most of the documents released by @entity229 to 2009 , when the administration was pushing lawmakers to reauthorize sections of the @entity182 that were set to expire			0
most of the newly declassified documents describe the aggressive push by the @entity2 , @entity236 and the @entity237 for lawmakers to save the bulk telephone data collection effort , known as the 215 program , because it was important for their efforts to thwart terrorist threats			1
@entity2 spying claims : five things you need to know the collection of mobile phone data , or metadata -- including numbers called and date , time and length of calls -- began in 2006 and matched the @entity2 's collection of land line telephone data			0
at the same time , lawmakers were urged not to discuss the classified program for fear it would hurt national security , the documents say			0
this year , after @entity10 released the cache of classified documents , including court orders detailing the 215 bulk data program , many lawmakers said they were shocked about the extent of the program			0
on tuesday , @entity109 said he was n't buying their reactions			0
" it reminds me of ' @entity273 , ' " @entity109 said , referring to the movie from the 1940s			0
" my @entity275 , there 's gambling going on here			0
" opinion : @entity3 needs to get spying under control @entity0 's @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 contributed to this report .			0

@entity286 : " this is not unique to the @entity3 , " a committee chair says
new : trying to determine the intentions of foreign leaders is a given , @entity109 said
