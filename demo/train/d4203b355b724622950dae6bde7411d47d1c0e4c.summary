@entity1 star @entity0 turned himself in to authorities early saturday in east @entity3 , one day after news broke that @entity0 had in the local prosecutor 's view hurt his child " with criminal negligence or recklessly " under the guise of discipline			1
shortly after reporting to authorities , @entity0 posted $ 15,000 bail and was released , according to the @entity13			1
that $ 15,000 likely wo n't make much of a dent on @entity0 's checkbook			1
he agreed to a lucrative contract in 2011 with the @entity17 , which numerous publications , including @entity1 , reported would be worth $ 100 million ( including $ 36 million guaranteed ) over a 7 - year period			1
still , the charge he faces has already impacted @entity0 negatively : he wo n't play sunday , at least , after the @entity17 deactivated him for their game with the @entity22			1
and the @entity1 said it was reviewing the incident under league 's personal conduct policy			1
@entity0 has n't spoken publicly since a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of child abuse			1
but his lawyer has , saying that @entity0 used " a switch to spank his son " in doling out discipline much like " he experienced as a child growing up in @entity3			1
" " ( @entity0 ) will continue to insist on his innocence of any intended wrongdoing , " the attorney , @entity36 , said friday			2
on saturday , @entity40 assistant district attorney @entity39 -- whose office made the case against @entity0 to the grand jury over a period of weeks -- said prosecutors " will take this charge extremely seriously and we look forward to presenting this case to a jury			1
" according to @entity3 law , a person can be convicted of injury to a child if they are proven to have caused bodily or mental injury " intentionally , knowingly , recklessly or with criminal negligence " or causing such harm by omission			2
the crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $ 1,000 fine			0
in @entity3 , someone can defend himself against a charge of injury to a child if they can prove it happened while they were administering " reasonable discipline , " @entity39 said			1
but that 's not what prosecutors think happened in @entity0 's case			1
" obviously , parents are entitled to discipline their children as they see fit , except for when that discipline exceeds what the community would say is reasonable , " the district attorney said			0
" and so , a grand jury , having indicted this case , looked at the injuries that were inflicted upon this child and determined that that discipline was not reasonable			1
" @entity1 fallout news of @entity0 's indictment rocked the @entity1			1
part of it has to do with the fact that @entity0 has long been one of the league 's most popular and successful players			2
his best campaign was in 2012 , when the @entity93 , @entity3 , born player earned @entity95 honors after rushing for 2,097 yards , just nine yards short of the single - season mark			0
the historic 2012 campaign came after a potentially career - ending knee injury			0
@entity0 's 2 - year - old son was found unresponsive last year in @entity100 , @entity101 , and later died of what authorities said were injuries consistent with abuse			2
@entity107 @entity106 , the boyfriend of the boy 's mother , has been charged with murder in that case			2
the felony injury to a child charge also comes at a tough time for the @entity1 generally because of the @entity116 case			1
league officials have been heavily criticized for their actions in that case , including the initial two - game suspension given to @entity116 prior to surveillance video that emerged showing him delivering a knockout blow to then - fiancee @entity124 in a casino elevator			0
( the two are now married			0
) after that video came out earlier this week , commissioner @entity127 made @entity116 's suspension indefinite			0
that decision was not enough , however , to placate critics -- especially after reports surfaced that @entity1 executives allegedly had received a copy in april of the damning video from inside the elevator and that @entity116 himself might have admitted in june to @entity127 that he 'd punched @entity124			2
these reports have shifted more criticism to @entity127 and other @entity1 executives			2
@entity116 certainly has n't gotten a pass either , especially with his future up in the air and the video showing him hitting @entity124 being played again and again on sports and news broadcasts			0
still , he has gotten some support			0
he returned saturday to watch a high school football game in his hometown of @entity149 , @entity150 , which is a @entity150 suburb			0
he was joined on the sidelines by @entity124			0
" @entity116 is a part of our family , and a part of this program , and that 's why i 'm very happy he 's here today because , because he made a mistake , " @entity153 football head coach @entity152 said			0
" and he made a very terrible mistake , but i know the character of the man and he will rise from this			0
" principal @entity165 noted that @entity116 's @entity167 jersey had been taken down from inside the school because of the ordeal and that school officials have condemned what happened in " no uncertain terms			0
" " at the same time , " @entity165 said , " we do support @entity116 and his family as they go through this hard , difficult time			0
because , again , this is his home			0
" @entity1 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story ' @entity1 toughens domestic violence policy with six - game bans			1

the @entity1 is reviewing the case under personal conduct policy
grand jury indicted @entity0 on a felony charge of injury to a child
it led the *sheriff* 's office to issue a warrant for his arrest
his bond amount was set at $ 15,000
