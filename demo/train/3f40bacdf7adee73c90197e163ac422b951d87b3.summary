-- this time last year @entity3 barely registered on golf 's radar , now it seems merely a matter of time before he assumes the mantle of major champion			1
the 20 - year - old will tee off at @entity11 on thursday as one of the favorites to lift the @entity14 , a measure of his stellar rise over the past 12 months			1
@entity3 became the youngest winner on the @entity19 for 82 years when he bagged the 2013 @entity20 , underlining the potential encompassed in his swing			1
he briefly held the lead during the final round of the masters before tying for second and was in contention at the @entity28 , eventually finishing fourth			2
so what price a maiden major championship in @entity32 aged 20 years and 10 months , roughly five months before @entity29 captured his first ? " i truly believe i can win a major -- right now i think i 'm ready to , " the @entity33 told @entity0			1
" each and every week is about preparing for the next major championship			1
" @entity37 is a major which is what legacies are defined by			2
that 's what @entity40 ( @entity41 ) says all the time , golf is all about winning majors			2
" to be able to go into this event with a lot of confidence , i feel like i 'm going to embrace the challenge			0
" much has been made of the test @entity11 will present , a markedly different one to 2005 when unfancied new zealander @entity50 triumphed			1
it has since been reshaped by two - time major champion @entity52 and his business partner -- famed golf architect @entity53 -- who have restored many of its original features			1
the pair have ripped out reams of rough and widened many fairways , but that wo n't necessarily makes things any easier			0
@entity64 scrub , pine straw and wiregrass now flank the fairways , meaning any errant tee shots could lead to a lottery in terms of lie			0
the winning scores in three of the last four @entity14 tournaments have been even par or less , underlining what a biting examination of a player 's game it represents			1
but that does n't phase @entity3 -- it excites him			1
" i love the hardest challenge you can get , " he explained			0
" @entity37 is the most difficult challenge in all of golf			2
that is exciting for us , it 's awesome			0
" it 's going to be really interesting at @entity11 with no rough			1
everyone who has been there has raved about the place			2
" any time you can play golf 's toughest test and try to test your game , if you can beat the golf course you really feel special after that round			0
" @entity3 has been feeling pretty special for most of the last year			1
his breakthrough victory at the @entity20 proved he possessed the talent and temperament required to prosper on the biggest stage			0
after memorably holing a bunker shot to force his way into a playoff , @entity3 secured victory on the fifth extra hole , defeating @entity106 and @entity107 , the @entity108 champion			1
he recorded a pair of top four finishes in the @entity111 , including second place in the season - ending @entity113 , before taking part in the @entity117 's winning @entity116 encounter with their international counterparts			2
at 2014 's first major , @entity3 muscled his way into the final group at @entity121 on sunday , and at one point assumed the lead from playing partner and eventual winner , @entity126			1
@entity3 finished in a tie for second			2
then at golf 's unofficial fifth major , the @entity28 , @entity3 was again in the final grouping before a late wobble saw him fall to fourth , playing partner @entity133 , from @entity134 , taking top honors			1
but for someone whose goal at the start of the season was to thrust himself into contention at a major championship , it was very much mission accomplished			2
" i knew i was going to be in all four majors and it was about getting out there and contending because i knew it would be a different feeling than contending in any event i 'd been in before , " he said			0
" i wanted to see how i would perform and sure enough at that first one in @entity121 i got off to the start i needed			0
" i had the right game plan that week			0
i knew how difficult the golf course was playing -- the weather made it firm and fast -- and i did n't let bogeys bother me			0
" i played my way into contention on sunday , i had the lead			0
" i feel like i played some really strong golf with the amount of pressure i felt that week -- a bounce here , a bounce there then i might have been wearing the green jacket on my first try			0
" that 's really cool looking back at that and knowing i accomplished one of my goals for the year			0
" @entity3 's preparations for @entity11 have included calls to @entity174 , to pick his brains as to the redesign , and strength and conditioning work in the gym			1
as well as repeating his " stay patient " mantra , @entity3 has also been grooving his swing to make sure it stands up to the fierce examination of the closing holes in a major championship			1
" i feel like it 's all falling into place , " @entity3 said			1
" i know from @entity121 when you are in the thick of things and you 're feeling that intense pressure the most important thing is making sure the most basic part of your golf swing stays the same			0
" it is tough staying patient , i 'm not a patient person off the course at all so it 's very hard , especially when emotions are so heightened			0
" i did a very , very good job of it at @entity121 , and a very good job for a little while at the @entity205			0
" i 've got a lot of confidence going in that i can put it together a little longer , just having been in the heat twice now in two of the strongest fields in the world that i 've ever played against			0
