-- @entity1 is said to have once written , " progress is impossible without change , and those who can not change their minds can not change anything			1
" there 's no doubting ol ' @entity1 would be drubbed as a " flip - flopper " if he were to set foot in a modern political campaign ( after denying he ever said that , of course )			1
but humans must think there 's something to it			1
we 've been changing our minds forever , right ? so , lest @entity20 sen. @entity19 think he 's out there on his own in deciding he was wrong about gay marriage , here are a few examples of some famous changes of heart , both real and imagined : @entity28 : from @entity29 - in - chief to @entity31 from @entity35 fries to fried chicken , the former president 's appetite was legendary			1
@entity38 pastry chef @entity37 had another world for it , he told @entity42 magazine : " scary			1
" " he had a big appetite , scary , " the magazine quoted @entity37 as saying			1
" he could eat five or six pork chops			2
" he loved the food at the @entity38 so much , in fact , he gained 18 pounds between 1997 and 1999			2
but a few years ago , @entity28 went almost entirely vegan after two bouts of heart surgery			1
no more cheeseburgers , no milkshakes			2
" i essentially concluded that i had played @entity54 roulette , " @entity28 told @entity0 's dr. @entity52 in 2011			1
" i was lucky i did not die of a heart attack , " he said			1
that nameless hater of green eggs and ham he does not like them , @entity60 - am			1
that 's what the shaggy , black - hatted thing in dr. @entity65 ' legendary childrens ' book tells hardcore ham - and - enthusiast @entity67			1
finally , worn down by @entity67 's relentless badgering , the creature -- worn down -- finally relents			2
" if you will let me be , i will try them , you will see			2
" a bit of munching , then ... " say , i like green eggs and ham ! i do ! i like them @entity67 ! " the same can not , unfortunately , be said of the millions of children whose well - meaning parents have invoked @entity60 to get their children to eat vegetables			1
they still wo n't eat them			2
not even on a goat			2
@entity84 : i 'm retired			2
no i 'm not in 2008 , the @entity87 quarterback decided to call it a career after 17 seasons , saying he 'd had a good run but that " all good things must come to an end			2
" " i know i can play , but i do n't think i want to , " he told reporters			0
but within a month , he 'd had a change of heart and said he wanted to come back			1
then he wanted back in			0
the @entity87 , exasperated , finally offered @entity84 a contract just to agree to stay retired			0
he refused and was eventually traded to the @entity97 , where he played for a season , then retired			0
until he had a change of heart and came back to play for the @entity100			1
an ankle injury ended that comeback			0
as of this writing , at least , the future @entity103 is still retired			0
@entity105 : after sleeping on it ... when the world first met @entity105 in 1843 , it was as a miserly skinflint whose tightwad ways made him a virtual ghost among the merrymaking men and women of @entity114			0
he was uncaring to the concerns of others that he 'd just as well see the poor die off to , as he would say , " decrease the surplus population			0
" but , after a series of spectral visits in which he is shown @entity121 past and present and learns of the dismal fate awaiting him in death , author @entity118 has his @entity105 awake a new man , throwing money around as if it were candy and making as merry as he could for the rest of his days			1
" and it was always said of him , " @entity118 wrote in the last paragraph of his novel , " that he knew how to keep @entity133 well , if any man alive possessed the knowledge			1
" the @entity136 : from scourge to saint as the @entity139 tells it , @entity136 was bad news for early @entity142			0
@entity143 describes him " breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the @entity147			0
" but one day , as he traveled to arrest @entity142 in @entity148 , @entity136 reported seeing lights and hearing the voice of @entity151 asking , " @entity136 , @entity136 , why do you persecute me ? " he took the name @entity136 and became the most significant evangelist of the early church			0
it 's from this biblical story that we get the phrase " damascus road experience , " describing a profound change of heart			1
scientists : sorry , @entity165 , you 're off the team back in 1930 , the scientists who thought about such things decided a newly discovered thing way out in the distant solar system was a planet , and decided to name it @entity165			0
but little @entity165 did n't even get through one of its 248 - year trips around the sun before @entity176 's scientists changed their mind			1
a mere 76 years after earthlings first spied the planet in the black of space , they changed their collective minds			0
too small , the scientists said			0
we found something bigger farther out			0
@entity186 , @entity165 's only twice as big as its moon ! it 's certainly not the only time scientists have changed their minds			0
but it 's one that 's captured plenty of the public 's imagination			0
how many planets ( or , certainly , ex-planets ) have their own fan site ?			0

history is *replete* with epic changes of heart
sometimes , as with @entity28 , outside circumstances force the change
second thoughts are a *hallmark* of science and *religious* *tradition* , too
from @entity118 to dr. @entity65 , flip - flopping is a common theme in *fiction*
