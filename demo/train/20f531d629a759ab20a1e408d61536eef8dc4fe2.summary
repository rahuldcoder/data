-- few items inspire universal teenage angst quite like the school report card , that mishmash of letters and numbers that could periodically mean the difference between family praise and punishment			2
sometimes , however , it can also inspire new business opportunities			0
a few years back , @entity12 was studying computer science at the @entity14			1
shortly after his return home for the holidays , he ran into one of his neighbors who started complaining about his child doing what so many other kids around the world with bad grades resort to : hiding their report cards from their parents			1
this got the young @entity32 programmer thinking : " i thought , we can actually come up with a solution to that problem , " says @entity12			1
" virtually every parent owns a cell phone in this country -- and that does n't have to be a smart phone to receive @entity38 , " he adds			0
" and so since i was doing computer science training on how to program and make software , we came up with a simple service to make it easy for these schools to send report cards by @entity45			1
" that service has today become @entity46 , a @entity47 - based sms service provider			1
with just a click of a few buttons , schools can send report cards to parents on their mobile phones , allowing them to keep better track of their children 's education			1
in addition , schools can also use the platform to distribute exam results , fee balances and general communication messages			2
@entity12 , 26 , says the service is designed to make parents become more involved			1
" if you are not up on how your kid is performing in school , then that kid to some extent probably feels not loved , " he says			0
" and then as a parent i want to know how my kid is performing so i can take some measures			0
i can go speak to the teacher and get to know why is he not performing well			0
" so far , more than 1,500 schools use @entity46 , forming a huge percentage of the startup 's clientele base			1
the rest is composed of small and medium businesses in @entity47 , which use the service to send information , bills and invoices to large groups through text messages			1
@entity12 , who started the company in 2011 , says the biggest problems initially were raising capital and convincing schools about the service			1
but he found a crucial ally in @entity93 , a @entity47 - based startup accelerator that helps budding entrepreneurs develop their tech ideas			2
" i probably would n't be here if it were n't for @entity93 , " he says			0
" it 's an organization that tends to start ups , people who want to do something but they do n't have the facilities , they do n't have the internet			2
" @entity12 has had a pretty successful start			2
his company made about six million @entity32 shillings last year -- that 's about $ 68,000			1
but even with his financial success so far , he remains grounded			0
" in terms of feeling accomplished , i think it is a long , long way to that point , " says @entity110			0
" it has not been as easy , the only thing that has been keeping us going on is a passion , " he adds			0
" you have to have a passion for what you do because you have challenges ; sometimes you run out of money , sometimes customers run away from you			0
" i think it is just beginning -- we have a thousand things we want to do and we ca n't wait to get started			0
