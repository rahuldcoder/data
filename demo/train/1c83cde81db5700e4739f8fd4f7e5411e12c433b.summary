-- with the wind in her hair , the ice cold air on her cheeks and powder flying from her skis , @entity1 took her sport to new extremes			1
the @entity10 hit the ramp hard , soaring 31 feet above the snow before returning to earth a world - record holder			1
that monumental leap in @entity16 three and a half years ago confirmed @entity1 's status as a force in her emerging discipline			1
less than a decade after turning her back on downhill ski racing , it was a moment for the freestyle star to savor			1
" i was on the @entity26 national team but i quit ski racing because it was n't fun for me anymore , " she told @entity0			1
` " i love powder , i love getting air			0
" as a teenager @entity1 had to choose between following her dream and pursuing her passion			1
downhill racing and a shot at @entity35 gold was a possibility , but she opted for a career in the discipline she loved -- freestyle skiing			1
" i thought i would go to the @entity42 for ski racing , when i decided that was n't my passion i let my @entity35 dream go , " said the 27 - year - old , who was born in the @entity10 but has a @entity26 father			1
with @entity49 's first @entity42 drawing ever closer , the two - time @entity48 gold medal winner could get one last chance to fulfill her childhood dream			1
slopestyle is a freestyle skiing discipline that sees competitors tackle a variety of obstacles , such as jumps and rails , as they descend a downhill course			1
rather than being ranked by time , skiers are judged on the variety and difficulty of the tricks they perform as they traverse the obstacles			2
at @entity67 , it will be part of the @entity42 for the first time			1
" i 've been watching the @entity42 since i was a little girl , " said @entity1 , who is based in @entity69 -- which hosted the 2002 @entity42			2
" it 's my favorite show every four years , watching all the female athletes			0
" i 've been following my heart the whole time having fun , now it 's back in my sights			2
it is crazy how dreams you think could never happen can happen			0
" this is my only shot at the @entity42			0
i 'm getting older and i 've competed a lot in this sport , i know this will be my one and only shot			0
" slopestyle is the latest event to make the transition from the modern , high - octane world of the @entity48 into the ancient , rarefied confines of the @entity35 arena			1
while @entity1 is embracing this new chapter in the short history of her sport , she is also keen to pay tribute to slopestyle 's @entity48 roots			1
" the @entity48 has always been our olympics because in the past we never had the @entity42 , " explained @entity1			1
" this year is definitely going to be different			2
we can look at snowboarding , where usually in an @entity35 year it 's a little toned down at the @entity48 , some athletes do n't do it			1
" for our sport it 's important to do it all , all of the contests which have been there since the beginning like the @entity48			2
it 's the birthplace of our sport			0
" the inclusion of slopestyle in the @entity35 program has brought @entity1 under the umbrella of the @entity10 ski team , giving her access to coaches and facilities which were previously inaccessible			1
" before the @entity42 my training consisted of going to the gym , building up my muscle to prevent injury , " she said			0
" but now we 're part of the @entity10 ski team i have a strength and conditioning coach , i have an air awareness coach for trampoline skills -- anything in the air and more gymnastic			1
" there 's been so much more coverage of our sport			0
i 've done way more media interviews			0
i 'm just really excited to be a part of it			0
" the @entity42 and the media circus which accompanies the @entity48 has helped slopestyle 's profile hit new heights			1
@entity1 hopes the young sport can continue to go from strength to strength			2
" i turned professional age 17 , i won the @entity139 , shortly after that i won the @entity48 and i kept winning and winning , " she said			2
" i 've been in the sport for over a decade now , which is incredible			0
i 've seen it grow from such a little thing ... i was the only girl in my terrain park , now i see girls in there every day , which is amazing			0
" now i get to see it grow into the @entity42 , which is really cool			0
" the final @entity10 selection competitions take place in december and january			2
if @entity1 is picked she will complete a journey which began when she was a child bouncing on a trampoline in her parents ' backyard			2
" i had a little garden trampoline , " she said			0
" i have a bigger trampoline now , you can jump really high , which is crazy			0
" i 'm not sure how i learned all of these tricks on my garden trampoline , but i did			0
" pushing the envelope has always been @entity1 's style , culminating in her history - making leap in 2010			1
" when i did my world record jump , i jumped 31 feet , " she said			0
" you do n't do that first			0
you start off with a small jump and you build up to a medium jump			0
you start off small and you work your way up			0
" our sport is all about progression and making things look newer , the other sports are quite regimented			2
you never know what you 're going to see in our sport			0
" come february , slopestyle fans could see @entity1 with a gold medal around her neck .			1
