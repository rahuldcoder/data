@entity4 , @entity3 for 62 years , if you cheated on your husband or wife in @entity3 , you could end up in prison			1
@entity3 's @entity7 on thursday overturned a law that made adultery a crime , saying it violates the @entity13 nation 's constitution			1
" the precondition of human dignity and right to pursue happiness is for each individual to have their rights to choose their fate , " the court ruled , saying that one 's sex life is private			2
" and the rights to choose their fate includes rights to be engaged in sex and choosing the partner			0
" up until then , anyone who cheated on their spouse could be charged and , if convicted , spent up to two years in prison			1
the same penalty also applied to " the one who fornicated with the " cheating spouse , according to the @entity7 's website			1
but that 's changing because @entity3 society has changed enough " to lose many parts of ( the anti-adultery law 's ) reason to exist , " the prevailing judges said , according to a news release summarizing their decision			1
the chief reason for originally enacting the adultery law was to protect women , these justices contended			0
the idea was that men -- who tended to be economically and socially more powerful -- took advantage of women			0
and if a man was charged criminally , that would give women more leverage in divorce proceedings			0
( in other words , a wronged wife might get more compensation after deciding to drop the charges			0
) yet 2015 is n't 1953 , when the law first went into the affect , according to the judges			2
after all , the current president of @entity3 -- @entity66 -- is a woman			2
" women are active socially and economically , and women no longer apply as economically weaker , " these judges wrote			0
" ... in addition , the law can not be viewed as ( exclusively ) protecting women			0
" seven judges signed on to this decision , but two dissented			0
the dissenting view said that legalizing adultery hurts efforts to promote family in @entity3			2
it points to statistics showing 40 % of @entity3 marriages since 2000 end in divorce			1
and between 2000 and 2006 , at least , 47.1 % of those divorces came about after one or more spouses cheated			0
" adultery and fornication go beyond a person 's rights ( and ) intrude on other people and the community , " these justices wrote			0
" considering that the relationship between husband and wife is the fundamental element of a family , the country and the society should legally protect and maintain ( this ) relationship			0
" the last time the @entity3 court looked at this law was 2008			1
since then , according to @entity3 news agency @entity106 , some 5,500 people have been indicted on adultery charges , though that does n't mean they ended up behind bars			2
it was not immediately clear what will happen to those cases , assuming they have n't been resolved already			0
but at least one entity that has reason to celebrate after thursday 's ruling , @entity116 , a @entity3 condom maker			1
it 's impossible to definitively say why , but @entity120 ' stock price did jump suddenly about 25 minutes after the decision came out			1
by day 's end , it was up a shade under 15 % from wednesday			1
@entity5 's @entity125 reported from @entity3 , and @entity5 's @entity126 wrote this story from @entity128 .			1

since 1953 , a @entity3 could get 2 years in prison for cheating on his or her spouse
the @entity13 nation 's @entity7 overturned that law , saying times have changed
a @entity3 condom maker 's stock price soars 15 % after the decision comes out
