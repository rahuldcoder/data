@entity1 , @entity0 -- the election of 736 members from 27 member countries to the @entity6 in june will be the biggest transnational electoral contest there has ever been			1
between them they will represent more than 500,000,000 people			0
about 375 million @entity13 citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote			1
but few understand how the low - profile @entity6 affects the lives of @entity13 citizens			1
here are answers to the most frequently asked questions about the contest			2
who will be voting , when and where ? about 375 million @entity13 citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote in the election of the parliament members for a five - year term			1
the elections will be held on thursday , june 4 in the @entity27 and the @entity28			2
there will be voting on friday , june 5 in @entity30 and the @entity31			0
and it will begin on saturday , june 6 in @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			0
the other countries will conduct their voting on sunday , june 7			2
elections will take place in all 27 member countries of the @entity13 , with the citizens of @entity45 and @entity46 included for the first time			1
how many meps are there and how many does each country elect ? there will be 736 members of the @entity6 ( @entity48 ) in the new assembly			0
the number each country has varies according to its population			0
@entity57 , with a population of 82 million , the biggest among @entity13 states , will have 99 members			1
@entity37 , with a total population of just 410,000 , will have only 5			0
will that number stay the same if the @entity63 comes into effect ? no. @entity63 , designed to give the @entity13 a new streamlined constitution for the @entity13 ( and to increase the powers of the @entity6 , ) has been put on ice following its rejection in a referendum in @entity30 , the only country to give electors a direct voice			1
but the @entity30 are due to vote again in the autumn			2
if they then vote @entity73 and all remaining @entity13 states ratify the treaty , then the @entity6 will be increased from 736 to 751 members on a different distribution formula			1
that means that 15 ' ghost @entity48 ' , will be elected on june 7 , entitled to attend the @entity6 but not to vote in it until the @entity63 goes through			1
what election system is used ? that varies according to the individual states represented , but all will be using some variant of proportional representation			1
in some countries candidates will all be on a single national list , making the entire country a constituency			2
others elect meps from regional constituencies			0
many countries set a threshold , insisting that parties have to gain an overall proportion of the vote -- 5 per cent in @entity34 and @entity57 , 4 per cent in @entity99 or @entity100 -- to qualify for any allocation of seats			1
whom do the @entity48 represent ? most would - be @entity48 contest the elections with the endorsement of national political parties			1
national parties such as the @entity108 in @entity57 or the @entity109 in @entity27 put up approved lists of candidates			0
but when they are in the @entity6 the @entity48 mostly operate in wider groups of left or right such as the @entity113 ( @entity114 ) , the @entity115 ( @entity116 ) or the @entity117			0
the main conservative grouping is the @entity119 ( @entity119 )			0
however , @entity120 , the national leader of @entity27 's conservatives , has withdrawn his members from the @entity119 , regarding it as too federalist in its approach			0
the groups work as a bloc when they can and have " whips " designed to make them as cohesive as possible			0
what powers do the @entity48 have ? much legislation in member states actually originates at a @entity134 level			1
national legislatures pass laws which have begun life as directives from the @entity139 , the @entity13 executive arm , which the @entity48 have helped to shape			1
they are the only elected part of the @entity134 apparatus which is otherwise dominated by @entity143 ( meetings of the prime ministers or finance or trade or interior ministers from the 27 nations ) or the @entity139			1
do @entity48 really make much difference to ordinary people 's lives ? it may not feel like it , day to day , but @entity48 often have more influence over the shaping of @entity134 legislation which filters down to national parliaments than the members of those national parliaments do when the laws get to them			1
recent @entity13 laws which have affected citizens directly include the " roaming directive " which restricted the charges mobile phone companies can impose on customers for calls in countries other than their own			1
@entity13 directives have helped initiate the era of cut - price air travel			1
it was the @entity13 which determined that telephone and data companies had to keep records for at least two years to help counter terrorism			2
and the so - called " @entity179 " directive has forced businesses to disclose what chemicals they use in their products and to ensure that they are safe			0
because driving legislation through the @entity6 requires the building of cross-party coalitions more than 50 percent of amendments proposed in the @entity6 end up as law			0
that is why company lobbyists spent much time in @entity192 trying to make their case to @entity48			0
but does the @entity6 have any muscle ? it has the rather drastic power to sack the @entity139			0
it also holds public hearings on newly - appointed commissioners			0
the @entity6 also has significant powers over how much of the @entity13 budget is spent			2
although most legislation originates with the @entity139 , if more than 50 percent of @entity48 back a resolution calling for new laws in a particular area the the @entity139 has to get down to work to propose some			2
the @entity13 is one of the largest aid donors in the world , dispensing some $ 15 billion a year across five continents and @entity48 have a significant say in that			2
where is the @entity6 situated ? most of its meetings are held in @entity192 close to the officials whose draft legislation is examined by the @entity6 's subject committees			0
but , at a considerable cost , some plenary meetings are also held in @entity221 , an arrangement which the @entity34 government has fought long and hard to maintain .			0

about 375 million @entity13 citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote
