supporters are coming to the defense of @entity2 , the scientist who helped land a space probe on a comet last week and simultaneously sparked cries of sexism with his choice of clothing			1
during the live stream of the @entity11 probe landing , @entity2 wore a shirt featuring comic - book - style images of scantily clad women carrying guns			1
the shirt led some to denounce an atmosphere unwelcoming to women in the science fields and even inspired the @entity21 hashtag # shirtstorm			2
@entity2 , a project scientist for the @entity22 , apologized friday during a progress report on the @entity24			2
" the shirt i wore this week , i made a big mistake , and i 've offended many people , and i am very sorry about this , " an emotional @entity2 said , wiping his eyes			2
we can land on a comet , but we ca n't ... @entity2 should n't be the one apologizing , according to @entity34 mayor @entity33			2
in his @entity36 column , @entity33 wrote that the " unrelenting tweetstorm " in response to @entity2 's shirt , coupled with the scientist 's emotional response to it , was a cruel act of public shaming			1
" it was like something from the show trials of @entity48 , or from the sobbing testimony of the enemies of @entity51 , before they were taken away and shot , " @entity33 wrote			0
" it was like a scene from @entity56 's cultural revolution when weeping intellectuals were forced to confess their crimes against the people			0
" the public should have been praising @entity2 's accomplishments with the @entity24 , @entity33 said			1
@entity33 is n't the only one coming to @entity2 's defense , with some concluding that complaints about @entity2 's shirt overshadowed a momentous occasion			1
in a @entity68 op - ed , @entity67 highlighted that several women worked alongside @entity2 to get the @entity24 off the ground , an accomplishment for women that did n't get nearly the attention that @entity2 's shirt garnered			1
" thanks for ruining a cool feminist moment for us , bullies , " @entity75 concluded			0
a @entity81 headline labeled the backlash " @entity83			0
" some in the science field sought to go beyond the " tweetstorm " to explain why # shirtstorm was not just about @entity2 's sartorial choice but highlights the larger issue of dismissive attitudes toward women in @entity91 , or the fields of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics			1
astronomer @entity97 explained in @entity98 that while he does n't want to tar @entity2 with the " misogynist " label , the shirt is emblematic of the @entity91 boys ' club , especially when paired with @entity2 's casual comment about setbacks his team has faced during the @entity24 : " she 's sexy , but i never said she was easy			1
" " if you think this is just women complaining , you 're wrong			0
certainly many have , and rightly so			0
but the fact is , i 'm writing about it			0
i can point you to many men , friends of mine , scientists and science communicators all , who have spoken up about it			0
it 's important that men speak up , and it 's important that we listen , too			0
" the backlash against those who complained about @entity2 's shirt is telling , college professor @entity124 wrote in @entity128 : " this response conveys that women are welcome in science , or science journalism , or the audience for landing a spacecraft on a comet , only as long as they shut up about any of the barriers they might encounter , while men in science should never , ever be made uncomfortable about choices they 've made that might contribute ( even unintentionally ) to throwing up such barriers , " @entity124 wrote			1
the woman who sewed the controversial shirt as a birthday present for @entity2 has written a blog post reiterating her support of the scientist , whom she calls " close and very loved friend			1
" " i am so proud of @entity2 and his achievements and the fact he is an interesting and very brave person to do what he did with the very sweet gesture he made towards my gift and to wear his individuality with pride , " wrote @entity150			2
though the shirt may have been a bad choice for the workplace , images of the heavily tattooed @entity2 wearing it showed that modern scientists are n't all sporting pocket protectors and taped - together eyeglasses , some said			2
" there must be room in our world for eccentricity , even if it offends the prudes , and room for the vague other - worldliness that often goes with genius , " @entity33 wrote in the @entity36			0
" dr @entity2 deserves the applause of our country , and those who bash him should hang their own heads and apologise			0
