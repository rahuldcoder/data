, the best of the lot arrives friday with @entity11 's brilliant " @entity10			1
" adapted from @entity14 's 1974 novel of the same name , the film is an exceptional treat for those who like to give their brains a little bit of a workout from time to time			1
the year is 1973 : the @entity21 is raging around the world , and @entity24 's security apparatus is split into two branches : @entity26 for domestic operations ( much like the @entity28 ) and the @entity29 , aka @entity30 ( the @entity32 equivalent )			1
it 's not really that simple , but go with it			1
code - named @entity35 , @entity30 is run by a small group , led by a man known only as " control " ( @entity39 )			1
a grizzled @entity21 veteran , @entity38 is convinced a @entity42 agent is embedded at the top of @entity35 , and he has authorized a clandestine operation to convince a @entity46 general with knowledge of the mole to defect			1
alas , the mission goes disastrously wrong , and agent @entity50 ( @entity51 ) is killed			0
in the aftermath , @entity38 is hung out to dry and forced to leave the service , taking with him his loyal lieutenant , @entity55 ( @entity56 )			0
in his involuntary retirement , @entity38 suffers a heart attack and dies			0
shortly thereafter , amid increasing evidence that @entity38 's fears were right , @entity55 is secretly rehired by the @entity24 government and tasked with uncovering the double agent			1
control has done some of the work for him and narrowed the suspects down to five men , all nicknamed after characters from a children 's nursery rhyme : @entity76 ( @entity77 ) is " @entity80 , " @entity78 ( @entity79 ) is " tailor , " @entity74 ( @entity75 ) is " soldier , " @entity72 ( @entity73 ) is " poor man " and @entity55 himself is codenamed " @entity82			1
" so distinct are these men that they each might as well have their own adjectives : " snippy " @entity86 ( are n't they all ? ) , " sardonic " @entity87 , " menacing " @entity74 and " unctuous " @entity77			0
if there were ever to be a remake of " @entity90 " ( and i should probably be struck dead for even imagining it ) , @entity73 would make an excellent @entity93 ( @entity94 )			0
due to the clandestine nature of his task , @entity55 is forced to recruit his team from the ranks of junior agents or the recently fired , including @entity100 ( the always excellent @entity101 from the @entity103 's " @entity102 " ) , who in one ingeniously staged sequence , must steal documents from @entity35			2
@entity101 also has the single most emotionally affecting scene in the film , illustrating the sacrifices the intelligence community must pay in the service of secrecy			2
as @entity55 , @entity56 does more with his eyes and subtle facial expressions than most actors do with histrionics and yelling , and he does n't say a word for what seems like forever at the start of the film			2
not only that , he 's the perfect example of hiding in plain sight			2
with a sloppy suit and giant owl - eye glasses , he looks old and worn , almost befuddled			0
but he 's the fox in the chicken house , wearing a chicken disguise , and when he speaks , it 's clear that his is by far the brightest bulb in the room , and you ignore him at your peril			2
@entity55 is a master spy in the real - world sense			2
@entity133 is great fun but realistically , you would n't want your espionage experts to be dashing , recognizable extroverts			0
you want them to be the everyday schmuck who 's reading the paper across from you on the subway or the random briefcase - toting @entity143 that lives down the hall			2
@entity14 was an @entity30 officer in the 1960s ( real name @entity146 ) , and his books have that air of authenticity detectable by even those who have no such experience themselves			1
as for the novel , those familiar with it will notice quite a few departures , omissions and location changes from the original ( and the big one , an @entity30 holiday party , was approved by @entity14 ) , but for all these differences director @entity11 et al			1
have nailed the important stuff : they have made a great film with the feel of the source material			0
there 's not a false note in the film			1
@entity11 ( " @entity170 " ) told the screenwriters ( @entity172 and his wife , the late @entity174 ) and designers he wanted the film to look and feel " like the smell of damp tweed , " and if it 's possible to pattern visuals after a smell , @entity11 , cinematographer @entity178 and the rest of the crew pull it off brilliantly			1
the flared collars and trousers in various shades of brown , tan and beige scream mid- 1970s , and you can practically hear the rustling of the corduroy slacks as they wade through piles of fallen leaves			0
if i were a betting man , i 'd put my money on @entity56 joining @entity198 ( " @entity203 " ) , @entity199 ( " @entity7 " ) , @entity200 ( " @entity201 " ) and @entity202 ( " @entity8 " ) as a best actor nominee			0
i consider only @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 as locks , but @entity56 's performance is the equal of any on this list , and these five could make for the strongest competition in this category for years			0
for those of you expecting @entity213 or @entity133 , please adjust your expectations			0
there is no gadgetry , no @entity218 , no sexy villains with silly names and no absurd doomsday devices			0
there is , however , a meticulously crafted thriller with complex characters , some great vintage @entity21 espionage , plot turns you wo n't see coming and some magnificent acting			1
" @entity10 " is rated @entity229 it contains some off - color language , brief nudity and a few short , sharp bursts of violence			1
it opens friday in @entity236 and @entity237 and expands throughout the country this winter .			0
