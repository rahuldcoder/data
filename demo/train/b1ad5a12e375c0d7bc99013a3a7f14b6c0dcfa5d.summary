this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 , @entity13 : this wednesday , february 17th , @entity0 begins with a big story out of southeast @entity15			2
i 'm @entity17 , reporting from the @entity18 in @entity19 ! first up : @entity20 arrested @entity21 : first up : what could be a major defeat for the @entity20			1
@entity25 officials say the @entity20 's second - highest leader has been arrested			1
details , right after some fast facts on the @entity20 : this is a militant organization that used to control @entity4			1
it allowed the @entity33 terrorist group to live and train there			2
a @entity36 led coalition knocked the @entity20 out of power in late 2001 , after the september 11th attacks on @entity36			1
now , @entity25 intelligence says @entity20 leader @entity40 was caught several days ago in @entity25 , which borders eastern @entity4			1
@entity40 's capture could be a huge victory for the @entity36 because @entity36 has been hunting him for years and he could have some incredibly valuable information about both the @entity20 and @entity33 terrorists			1
@entity36 officials are saying this could be a turning point in the war in @entity4			2
but there is a hitch : the @entity20 deny that @entity40 's been caught			1
they say he 's still working for them and that reports of his arrest are designed to hurt the @entity20 's morale			1
that is important to them right now because @entity36 , along with other coalition forces , are currently fighting the @entity20 in southern @entity4			1
in the town of @entity61 , a stronghold of the @entity20 , @entity36 - led forces are making progress			1
@entity63 took over a police headquarters there yesterday			2
new @entity66 @entity36 president @entity67 : we are announcing roughly $ 8 billion in loan guarantees to break ground on the first new nuclear plant in our country in three decades			2
@entity21 : and it would be an expansion of this nuclear facility in the eastern part of @entity77			1
the @entity67 administration claims the two , new nuclear reactors would create more than 3,000 construction jobs and 850 permanent jobs at the nuclear plant			2
the @entity84 also says the power it would generate would be enough for more than half a million homes			2
@entity88 leaders , including both of @entity77 's senators , like this idea			1
sen. @entity91 says it 's a step in the right direction , adding , the power generated by the @entity95 -- that 's the one that 's already there -- is safe , reliable , emissions - free and environmentally responsible			1
but some @entity100 are against it , along with nuclear power critics			2
one of those , energy analyst @entity103 , says , " the last thing @entity36 want is another government bailout for a failing industry			2
" @entity103 went on to call nuclear power " unsafe and dirty			2
" @entity5 's warning @entity21 : @entity5 's nuclear plan is worrying diplomats at the @entity112			1
and @entity5 's leader is warning the @entity114 not to punish his @entity116 nation for its nuclear program			1
at a news conference yesterday , @entity5 president @entity118 said he wants the @entity112 to " move in the spirit of cooperation			1
" but if it does n't , he says @entity5 would react in a way that would put the @entity112 to shame			2
to the international community , those are very unwelcome words			2
the @entity112 wants @entity5 to stop enriching uranium , because enriched uranium could help @entity5 make an illegal , nuclear weapon			2
@entity5 continues to argue its program would be used only to help provide power to civilians			2
the global community does n't believe it			2
cybersecurity @entity21 : there are attacks going on in the @entity36 that most people never hear about probably because most of the time , they fail			2
we 're talking about cyber attacks			2
and many times , they come from other countries , testing our electronic systems -- they might target cell phone companies , power companies , internet companies			2
yesterday , a panel of former government workers got together in a cyber-attack drill to work on ways the @entity36 could react to a large - scale , cyber attack			1
what they hope to get out of this are ideas : suggestions they could take to the @entity67 administration on how to improve the electronic systems that so many of us rely on day - to - day			1
@entity161 @entity162 , @entity13 : today 's shoutout goes out to the students of @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 ! which of these rulers was known as " the boy king " ? you know what do to ! was it : a ) king @entity175 , b ) @entity177 , c ) @entity174 ) @entity178 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the ancient @entity180 @entity178 is " the boy king " ; he took over at around age 10			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity185 @entity21 : so we know he was young when he took over , that he died young in his late teens , and that @entity178 ruled for about 10 years , starting in around 1336 b.c. but there is so much more we do not know , like how he died			1
well , there 's a new report out , based on @entity178 's dna			1
it 's being published this week in the @entity194 and it could fill in some blanks			1
the report suggests that the boy king died of complications from a broken leg along with malaria , a disease of flu - like symptoms carried by mosquitos			1
he also had a form of scoliosis and foot disease : health problems that researchers believe ran in his family			0
@entity210 @entity21 : hip - hop and classical : two musical genres that do n't seem to go together			1
but the @entity214 and hip - hop artist @entity215 mixed it up recently			1
it 's part of the orchestra 's work to promote the arts in school curriculum as well as try something new and novel			1
hear for yourself how it came together and how it sounded			0
( begin video ) @entity227 : the @entity214			0
" @entity228 " @entity229 , @entity230 : classical music , it gets kind of the rap that it 's , you know , old - timey and boring and that it 's for an older generation			1
it 's really the basis of how a lot of the music today is put together			1
the chance to work for a symphony to me is extraordinary			0
@entity246 , rapper [ @entity247 ] : use it to escape ...			0
@entity249 , @entity250 , @entity214 : well , i think this is our first venture into hip - hop			1
by blending the two , i think that we reach really a kind of a broad expansive of audiences			0
we took basically a sampling of a piece			0
@entity229 : gave me " @entity261 " by @entity262			0
i took the sample and i slowed it down , which kind of gave it this sort of feel right here			0
and i took it , chopped it up , and kind of looped it again , and then i added a second part right here			1
i usually start layering it with instrumentation , so , and the guitar kind of gives it that laid - back , just good - feeling vibe to it			1
as is with hip - hop , you know , you 've got to have , this is the , that snap is what , the fact that it kind of gets you really bobbing your head			1
kind of really feeling the music right there			0
what really drives it is this			0
once we got the music together , then we brought in @entity215 to do , to bring in and do the lyrics for us			0
@entity294 [ @entity247 ] : music , yes , feel good , music			0
craft : the hood goes , music is my life			0
@entity301 [ @entity302 ] : music is my life			0
@entity294 [ @entity247 ] : the base clef and treble clef carries me away			0
craft : i 'm , like , i 'm lost in the music			0
@entity306 [ @entity302 ] : on a beat like maestro			0
@entity294 [ @entity302 ] : music is my life			0
@entity306 [ @entity302 ] : it 's with me everywhere			1
it 's in my soul			1
@entity294 [ @entity247 ] : music , yes , feel good music			0
so i got to make you feel good			0
craft : i 'm singing and rapping in front of the orchestra while , you know , the conductor is conducting the music , like , it 's , wow			1
@entity294 [ @entity247 ] : whether you appreciate my musical past			0
everything in life has a rhythm , has emotion			0
through emotion music will infinitely last			0
@entity249 : it was just fascinating			0
a fascinating piece of work			0
whether it 's , whether it will last as a real art form or genre or just as an experiment , i ca n't tell			1
but it was fun to do it			0
@entity227 : it was very fun			0
i am , i 'm a big fan of hip - hop			1
i like to dance a lot			0
@entity294 [ @entity247 ] : oh how i love my music craft : thank you so much			0
( @entity343 ) promo @entity21 : @entity345 , tomorrow , 7:00 p.m. @entity116 , 4:00 p.m. @entity346 : be there			0
i will be live at @entity345 / @entity349 , answering your questions			0
they could be questions for me , questions about the show			0
you know where to find us : @entity345 / @entity349			0
before we go @entity21 : before we go , picture an igloo			0
maybe one of those domed rooms of ice blocks with a little crawl space to get inside			0
now picture a luxury igloo			0
because what else would you call a spacious , four - room , iced house wired for a sound system , fired for warmth with a wheelbarrow , and , oh yes , a flat - screen tv			1
it 's taken since about @entity371 's to finish the thing , but it 's no doubt the coolest home you 'll ever see			1
goodbye @entity21 : ... though to live there , you 'd have to be an ig - lunatic			2
i can see your class from here , and i can feel your cold stares			0
hopefully , you 'll warm back up to us by tomorrow			0
i 'm @entity17 for @entity0 .			0
