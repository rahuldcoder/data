-- one of the most perverse results of the @entity3 's lame , overzealous -- and possibly criminal -- behavior in looking into the tax - exempt applications of assorted advocacy groups is this : they 're a lot safer from scrutiny today than they were yesterday			1
after this @entity3 mess , who in government is going to be in a rush to take on -- or try to regulate -- the groups they should actually be looking at as political operations , overt or covert ? um , not many			1
here 's the real deal : it 's an open secret in @entity20 that some of these groups , which spent huge amounts of money during presidential campaigns , are politically aligned			1
whatever their " labels , " as the @entity3 might call them , they have been tax - exempt because they claim to be dealing with issues rather than elections			1
that is , policy , not political candidates			0
but in the heat of a general election , when policy is politics , how can anyone tell the difference ? @entity41 is a @entity43 brand ; @entity45 's @entity44 is n't likely to do anything other than help the @entity47			1
to gain their tax - exempt status , they 're supposed to promote the " social welfare			0
" what , exactly , does that mean ? it 's a complicated question that has become infinitely more complex in the wake of the @entity57 's @entity56 decision , which allowed corporations to start donating directly to activist groups			1
suddenly , the potential of getting some dibs on their considerable money grew larger			0
the groups designated as @entity64 ( 4 ) became the perfect pots to hold the dough , and they swelled , literally and figuratively			0
and the @entity3 did n't do much about it			1
it might have been a better idea , rather than embarking on what seems like a potentially criminal political fishing expedition , to actually take a look at the huge amounts of money being spent out in the open during the last campaign			2
why was n't the @entity3 " scrutinizing the big fish , " asks @entity75 , the chief lawyer for the @entity76 , a watchdog group that has pushed ( unsuccessfully ) for the @entity3 to investigate these groups			1
" the @entity3 needs to be focused on the big fish and not on the little @entity81 tea party groups , and certainly not based on their political ideology			1
" ah , but that 's exactly what happened -- and , as a result , these groups that , according to some estimates , collectively spent over $ 250 million on candidates during the last election are still tax - exempt			2
can it be that the @entity3 investigators were so silly , clueless and unaware of their appropriate role ? @entity94 , yes			2
but the legal eagles reading and interpreting the @entity3 laws are obviously a lot smarter			2
in its description of the @entity64 ( 4 ) category , the @entity3 lays it out pretty plainly			2
" examples " of organizations under this statute that would be considered tax - exempt , it says , are " civic associations and volunteer fire companies			0
not exactly political in any way , shape or form			0
what 's more , the @entity3 also makes it clear that , in order to qualify , the burden is to prove that " your organization is organized exclusively ( italics mine ) to promote social welfare			1
" but according to @entity75 , the gremlins ( i.e. the lawyers ) have managed to figure out a way to get around this			0
the new " perceived line , " he explains , is that all these groups need to do is spend less than half of their money on politics			1
he calls it the " tax lawyer community interpretation			0
" huh ? is that how we 're running the government ? so if these groups spend less than half of their money on politically related activism , the dough they collect from big corporations and donors can be used for campaign activities , all without disclosure of where the money came from			1
this has not escaped the notice of @entity144 , especially @entity43 who have been outgunned by @entity47 - leaning groups			0
" we urge you to protect legitimate section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) entities by preventing non-conforming organizations that are focused on federal election activities from abusing the tax code , " seven @entity43 @entity148 senators wrote then - @entity3 commissioner @entity149 last year			1
what makes sense is for the @entity3 to make sure that its laws are followed			2
citizens can at least expect that their government might know the difference between quashing political dissent and legitimate inquiry			0
fishing expeditions on political - sounding names is just stupid , if not venal			0
and now , the obvious -- and perverse -- consequence of the @entity3 bungling : it has just made the world safer for tax lawyers			0
your taxpayer dollars at work			0
