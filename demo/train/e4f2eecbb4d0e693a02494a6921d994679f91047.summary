-- @entity1 took @entity3 bobsledder @entity2 to the @entity5 track one last time tuesday and asked his driver if he could do it			1
he was n't asking him to win ; he was asking him whether he could compete			2
the coach and his pilot walked the course , and @entity1 told van @entity2 to think about it , giving him an hour to make a decision			1
@entity16 told his coach he just could n't drive this track and so on wednesday the four - man @entity19 sled from the @entity3 pulled out of the @entity20			1
because their driver was terrified			2
" i 've never seen someone get to a major event and not compete because they 're scared			0
you keep your inner fears to yourself and do it , " de la @entity1 told reporters at a news conference			2
" that 's why it 's such a popular sport in the military			2
it 's that kind of macho sport			2
you go over the top together			0
" @entity16 , ranked 11th on the @entity39 four - man tour , crashed on his first run during two - man practice on saturday			1
that and the memories of other crashes , including one that resulted in two teammates in the hospital , were too much for @entity2			2
he never felt comfortable on the track during the two - man competition when he and teammate @entity51 finished 14th			1
he and the rest of the four - man team were absent from two training runs on tuesday , as he struggled with what to do			1
it did n't help that eight sleds crashed on that first day of training			0
and so that night , he made the decision to give up			0
" i have to look after my boys and ca n't close my eyes to that , " he told reporters			0
" for me , it 's not about performing			0
" it was a split decision among the team to quit the games , said @entity1 , who talked about how he told his driver he was making a choice he would regret forever			1
" i 've told him that to his face , " de la @entity1 said , " but as a coach i have to support it because i 'm responsible for him sending his team down the track in the right frame of mind			1
" for @entity80 , who wanted to continue , it was a heart - wrenching outcome to his last @entity20			0
the man who carried the @entity3 flag in the opening ceremonies said there was no tension on the team , but he was n't the one looking out for three teammates			1
" if you ask me if i want to slide i 'd say , ' yes '			2
but i do n't have to steer ; i just get in the back and go down			2
i do n't have the responsibility , " said @entity80			0
but he also said he was upset that he 'd come to his third @entity20 and would not get a chance to compete			0
" this was my last chance to do something special , " said the 33 - year - old , who competed in the @entity94 and the @entity95 on the track team			0
@entity51 said he was frustrated because he wanted to show the world the progress the @entity3 has made in bobsled , but safety was paramount			1
@entity104 , the fourth member of the team , supported his brother 's decision , pointing to the difference in the size of the two - and four - man sleds			1
the two - man sled is smaller and easier to control			1
@entity104 , who had his doubts about the safety of the track , worried his brother had lost his nerve and would n't be able to steer the big sled through turns 11 , 12 and 13			2
not even changes to the track on tuesday could help reassure the brothers			0
" it was a lot better , but for us it was maybe too late , " @entity104 said			0
@entity125 pinned some of the blame on @entity104 's wife , saying that she had been worried about her husband 's safety ever since @entity132 luger @entity131 had crashed and died on the same track during the first day of the games			1
" when @entity104 is scared and upset , obviously it has influence , " he said			0
but @entity104 said the death had no influence , and @entity2 agreed that the track was not to blame for his decision			1
" it 's a challenging and exciting track			0
you have to deal with it as a pilot			0
that comes with the job			0
sometimes you deal with it less good , " he said			0
" it 's nothing to do with the track , just my lack of confidence at the moment			1
" competition in the four - man competition starts friday with the medals decided on saturday after the last of four runs .			1

new : coach @entity1 : " i have to support " the pilot 's decision
new : teammate : " if you ask me if i want to slide i 'd say , ' yes ' . but i do n't have to steer "
@entity2 , driver of the @entity3 four - man bobsled quits the @entity168 citing lack of confidence
@entity16 said his decision is *unrelated* to death of @entity132 luger
