-- the " @entity2 " affair has set off a firestorm of debate in @entity5 and beyond -- about what constitutes support for terrorism , about detention without trial , deportation and , yet again , about the vexatious issue of @entity5 's relationship with @entity14			1
@entity2 is a militant @entity15 preacher who had been held in high - security jails in the @entity5 for a total of six years			1
last week , an immigration tribunal granted him bail , despite the government 's objections			0
@entity2 came to the @entity5 in 1993 with his wife and three children and was granted refugee status because he had been tortured by @entity26 authorities			1
but that was before his militant preaching became an issue and before @entity30 became public enemy no. 1			0
@entity5 has historically generous criteria for granting political asylum , but the consensus now on the left and the right is that the 51 - year - old preacher should not have qualified			2
by the time he arrived in @entity5 from @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity2 's hardline @entity39 views were well formed			1
writing in @entity43 in 2006 , @entity42 quotes a @entity45 journalist who had met @entity2 in the early 1990s			2
@entity46 said " @entity2 had struck him as far more radical than @entity47 ... influenced by @entity39 , the puritanical , fundamentalist strain of @entity49			2
" as a preacher in @entity52 mosques , @entity2 soon gained a militant following			2
in 1999 , he allegedly sought to justify the killing of @entity55 , including children , and attacking @entity57			0
three days after 9/11 , @entity2 preached that the attacks were part of a global struggle between @entity61 and @entity49 , and were a response to @entity57 's unjust policies			1
in another sermon , he sought to justify the killing by a muslim of a " non-believer " for the sake of @entity49			0
at the same time , @entity2 ran a magazine called @entity70 , which supported jihadists in @entity72 at a time when the @entity74 of @entity72 was waging a brutal campaign of massacres and assassinations			1
his rhetoric attracted a growing following in mosques and online among young militants , but no evidence has been produced in a @entity5 court to suggest he was involved with specific @entity30 conspiracies			2
a @entity86 government indictment sought to show that @entity2 did go beyond sermons			1
it alleged that an @entity30 member , @entity89 , made more than 20 trips from @entity86 to @entity5 between 1995 and 2000 , bringing @entity2 funds raised for jihad			1
when @entity52 police raided @entity2 's home early in 2001 , they found $ 250,000 in cash under his bed			1
@entity2 maintained it was to build a mosque , but some of the money was said to have been marked for the @entity103 mujahideen -- at that point a cause celebre among jihadists			1
@entity2 was detained in the @entity5 in 2002 under sweeping anti-terror legislation enacted after 9/11 -- along with dozens of other @entity108 militants			1
videos of his preaching were found in a @entity113 , @entity112 , apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks , including ringleader @entity117			1
@entity5 and other intelligence agencies asserted he had close ties to @entity30 leader @entity47			2
counter-terrorism sources also maintained he was a big influence on @entity122 , the @entity26 who would emerge as @entity30 's leader in @entity125			0
both had been convicted of involvement in a terror plot in @entity26 in 2000 , and according to one @entity30 operative , it was @entity2 who had introduced @entity122 to the @entity30 leadership			2
would - be shoe - bomber @entity132 was also an admirer			0
in denying @entity2 's release from jail in 2004 , a judge said , " we have no doubt that his beliefs are extreme and are indeed a perversion of @entity49 for the purposes of encouraging violence against non-muslims and @entity144 who are , or have been , supportive of @entity57			1
" in arguing for his continued detention the following year , the @entity5 government summarized his role , saying " he provides advice which gives religious legitimacy to those who wish to further the aims of extreme @entity108 and to engage in terrorist attacks , including suicide bombings			0
" his place in jihad was not unlike that of militant preacher @entity158 , who was killed in @entity159 last year			0
after @entity5 's highest court struck down detention without trial , @entity2 remained behind bars as the @entity5 government began proceedings to deport him to @entity26			1
he 'd already been convicted there in absentia of involvement in two terrorist attacks in 1998 , as well as the 2000 plot			0
@entity2 appealed , saying deportation would put him at risk of torture and lengthy pre-trial detention			0
his case moved gradually up the ladder of @entity5 justice but was eventually dismissed by the @entity177 , which found that " the risk that evidence obtained by torture would be used in the criminal proceedings in @entity26 would not amount to a flagrant denial of justice			1
" enter the @entity183 , whose decisions are binding in @entity5 cases			0
last month , the court decided that @entity2 could not be deported to @entity26 because there was " a real risk of the admission of evidence obtained by torture at his retrial			0
" @entity5 prime minister @entity194 reacted angrily to the decision , telling the @entity196 last week : " it is not acceptable that we end up with a situation you have someone in your country that threatens to do you harm that you can not try , you can not detain and you can not deport			0
" it 's a red meat issue to @entity206 politicians in @entity5			2
traditionally hostile to @entity14 's influence in @entity5 's affairs , they believe the @entity5 should not be bound by the court 's decision			2
ministers are conscious that emotions are running high			0
home secretary @entity214 told @entity215 : " the right place for a terrorist is a prison cell ; the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell far away from @entity5			0
" but as one popular tweet puts it : " @entity2 has not even been convicted of a parking offense in @entity5			1
" and that 's for two reasons			0
authorities are unwilling to produce evidence in open court that might prove some operational or direct link to terrorism for fear of compromising intelligence sources			0
and it is notoriously difficult to prove a crime has been committed by the use of words that influence others ' actions			0
as @entity5 's @entity240 admitted in 2005 : " we accept that @entity241 encouraged and raised funds for individuals to go to @entity244 ; he may not have gone further as an organiser			2
" while the @entity5 authorities try to negotiate assurances from @entity26 that would allow his deportation , @entity2 is on bail , but under strict conditions			1
he is electronically tagged , confined to his home for 22 hours a day , banned from using the @entity253 or a cell phone , banned from attending any mosque or publishing any statement , banned from receiving visitors without permission -- and those are just a few of the conditions			0
for now , @entity2 's ability to invigorate the hearts of jihadists is very limited .			1

@entity2 's hardline views were formed before he entered @entity5
he ran a magazine , @entity70 , supporting jihadists in @entity72
a video of his sermons was found in a 9/11 bomber 's apartment in @entity112
