-- from the humanitarian crisis in @entity2 to art therapy and literacy programs , find out about the favorite charitable organizations and causes of some of @entity9 's biggest names			1
" there is more hope and love on the cancer floor of the hospital than anywhere else in life , " says @entity10			2
intensive care when @entity10 visited @entity19 , their to - do list was simple : playing , reading books and talking			1
" i told her to come live with me , " says @entity19 , 6 , who spent last year at @entity23 undergoing leukemia treatments that made her lose weight and her curls			2
@entity19 now returns monthly for " pokies " -- 6 - year - old - speak for chemotherapy -- but she is considered lucky			2
" there are reasons our children are dying at a faster rate , " says @entity10 , 32 , who notes that @entity30 children have a significantly higher cancer - mortality rate owing to factors like delayed diagnosis and the language barrier			1
to combat those odds , the @entity40 actress teamed up with @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , an @entity44 - based organization that works with area hospitals to provide counseling , support and information for children with cancer			1
it assists about 750 families each year			2
since stepping up as national spokeswoman in 2005 , @entity10 has helped raise funds for children like @entity19 and their loved ones			1
" it is too difficult , " admits @entity19 's mother , @entity57 , who turned to @entity42 for assistance			2
@entity10 has already recruited celebrity friends , including @entity61 , @entity62 and her husband , @entity63 , to bolster her efforts			2
her next goal is to help the organization go national and hire hospital interpreters			2
until then , she 'll continue her visits , bringing along toys , chocolates and the message that there is someone to listen -- in @entity74 or in @entity75			2
" i am there to hear their story , to comfort them , " says @entity10 , " to let them know that they are remembered and important			2
" @entity82 and crafts a worn homemade @entity84 hangs on the wall of the @entity88 @entity87 hospital room that @entity90 , 17 , shares with his pet turtle and another patient			2
on the announcement @entity90 's name is more prominent than that of his famous collaborator , @entity97 , and a fan letter from the actress hangs nearby			2
" my dear @entity102 , " it reads , " i will always love you			1
marry me , please ( or at least consider it ! )			2
" " he 's a witty little flirt , " says a laughing @entity97 , who met @entity90 last year during her first hospital visit for the @entity107 , an @entity44 charity that pairs artists with young people battling serious medical conditions , like cancer and @entity112			0
the actress regularly does artistic projects with kids in the program , some of whom are limited by conditions requiring ventilators or tracheotomies			0
" a lot of the kids ca n't communicate , but it 's amazing how much they say to you with their eyes , " says @entity97			0
" their faces light up when they hear music or see dancing			0
" the @entity107 offers many projects , from sculpture to jewelry making and sand art , to foster creativity in patients , no matter what their challenges			0
" we bring the paint to their beds and finger - paint , " says @entity97 , who helps by opening their fingers and guiding them on the page			0
" it is great for them to feel the paint on their hands , " she says			0
" it 's all sensorial			0
" last year she worked with more than 20 children to create a mural - size painting from overlapping handprints , which was then auctioned off at a fund - raiser			1
@entity97 , who plans to contribute her own paintings to help raise money , has seen the group gain momentum during her weekly hospital visits			0
in 2005 the charity worked with 5,000 children ; last year it was 25,000			1
" it 's nice to be there to watch it grow , " says @entity97 , " and to grow with it			0
" @entity168 when @entity169 packed his bags for a january 2005 trip to @entity2 , @entity172 , where government - sponsored militia have killed 400,000 and displaced 2.5 million people , the last thing on his mind was personal safety			1
" i was n't nervous about going , " says @entity169 , 42			1
" i was nervous about what i would see			0
" what he observed has stayed with him to this day			0
the villages he visited were deserted after attacks by the @entity185 militia ( whose tactics include fire , rape , murder and starvation ) ; the shelters at refugee camps in neighboring @entity194 turned out to be little more than temporary tarps			0
" people are living in dust , surrounded on all sides by terror , " says @entity169			1
he did his best to connect with the children in @entity2 -- like juggling rocks to encourage them to play -- but " the kids were drawing pictures depicting bombers , " he says			1
" it was heartbreaking because you could see their future , and it was bleak			0
" he saw similar circumstances six months later , when he visited war - torn @entity210 , where more than 30,000 children have been abducted and forced into a rebel army			1
" my daughter listened to a 12 - year - old talk about having to kill his best friend , " says the actor , who visited shelters where children sleep for protection			1
" it opened my eyes			0
what hope do people in @entity2 have ? what hope do people in @entity210 have ? " @entity169 believes things will get better only when the international community demands change from elected officials			1
@entity232 , senior adviser of the @entity233 , who traveled with @entity169 , says , " nothing is as powerful as citizens writing letters saying , ' this issue matters			1
if you do n't do anything , i 'm going to take that into consideration when i cast my vote			0
' " until then the only assistance comes in the form of rescue workers			1
" but they are down there with only courage and conviction , " says @entity169			1
" and that does n't stop bullets			0
" for more information go to @entity254			0
by the book " who wants to hear a story ? " @entity258 asks a scrum of eager tykes all under the age of 5 as she plops down with them on the floor to read a classic tale			1
" then came the big @entity265			0
' trip , trap , trip , trap , trip , trap ' went the bridge , and the bridge creaked and groaned under him , " she reads in a low , ominous voice			1
" who 's that tramping over my bridge ? " @entity279 demands loudly , now sounding decidedly troll - like , as her listeners at @entity280 , a @entity282 preschool , giggle and lean in closer			0
several stories later , at the end of the reading hour , each child will go home with a new book of his or her own , courtesy of @entity292 , an organization that provides disadvantaged children with books			1
@entity279 , who has been a spokeswoman for them for the last five years , " is someone who understands how powerful books can be for a child , " says the group 's president , @entity295			1
@entity279 became involved with @entity292 through her friendship with a children 's book publisher			1
in addition to raising awareness of the group 's work , she frequently visits schools to read to the students and willingly participates in @entity292 fund - raisers			0
but , says @entity314 , her commitment goes beyond using her celebrity to help the cause			0
" she has even been to our dirty , dusty warehouse , carting out books and loading them into the trunks of people 's cars			1
" for @entity279 , it 's simply part of fulfilling the group 's mission : getting books into the hands of children			1
" these kids are in a situation where they always get secondhand things , but here they get new books to bring home and share , " she said			2
" it 's an esteem - building thing			0
" which certainly has been constructive			0
with the help of supporters like @entity279 , the organization has just given away its 50 millionth book , and that speaks volumes			0
a world of hope when @entity347 visited the @entity349 nation of @entity350 in 2005 , the @entity346 ambassador left her mark on the landscape			1
" i planted a peach tree there , " says the actress			0
" the fruit is supposed to bring good luck and blessings			0
" in truth , blessings are in short supply in many of the regions she has visited through @entity346 , which offers global health and educational support for children			2
taking inspiration from past ambassadors like @entity369 , @entity347 offered her services three years ago			1
since then she has been on call for humanitarian trips to places in @entity349 and @entity374 and has made a habit of keeping her passport with her and her immunizations up - to - date			0
last year she visited @entity378 , @entity379 , after an earthquake left more than 70,000 dead			1
she arrived to find rubble and camps with " 13 people sleeping in one very small tent , " says @entity347 , who helped distribute warm clothes			1
" the line kept going on for miles ; people were desperately trying to get shoes and socks for their young ones			0
" more disturbing was the makeshift outdoor " school " next to a mass grave for children who had died in the quake			1
" everyone was sitting in a circle on the dirt for the class , " says @entity347			1
" there was a grave a foot away			2
" the message was clear to her : life continues			0
another unforgettable moment came when a student in a @entity350 school offered up her tight little fist			0
" she opened it , and there was a nub of a pencil that she was holding on to for dear life , " recalls @entity347			1
" it 's amazing how much they want to be educated			0
" schooling is just one step for the organization , which uses even the smallest donations to address needs like immunizations and basic health care that help to save more than two million children each year			2
" contribute 50 cents , a dollar or 10 cents , " says @entity347			1
" it all adds up , and we know exactly where every penny is going			0
" for more information go to @entity346			0
