-- with a crop of political movies in the @entity5 running , this weekend @entity1 is looking more like @entity6			1
@entity8 contenders such as " @entity9 , " " @entity10 " and " @entity11 " have managed to pay off at the box office even as they brought politics and history to the big screen -- proof that we 'll take smart over stupid as long as we 're entertained while educated			1
but what 's really notable about these films is that for the most part they avoid hagiography			1
they dare to show complexity			2
this does n't mean indulging in moral relativism ; evil exists and these films acknowledge it			1
but the human dimension is kept intact rather , with characters not divided into simply angels versus devils			2
the real tradeoffs behind difficult decisions are acknowledged , consistent with the idea that the truth is never pure and rarely simple			0
in " @entity9 , " the @entity39 agents are far from @entity41 clones			1
suited up in 1970s regalia , @entity43 's disheveled character is separated from his wife and child			2
he quaffs wine and chows down on @entity48 , and is outclassed by @entity1 producers cooperating in the creation of the fake film that provides cover for an escape of embassy personnel from @entity55			0
the film does n't blink at the brutal mob mentality of revolutionary @entity59 radicals , but it also takes time to explain the vicious cycle that began when the @entity39 helped topple and democratically elected @entity61 and replaced him with the shah			2
the @entity65 @entity64 is depicted as well - intentioned and principled but not exactly a crackerjack all - star team			0
likewise , the @entity67 who kill @entity68 in " @entity10 " are disciplined in their work but not portrayed as anything resembling perfect in their personal lives			1
the lead @entity39 agent , @entity73 , played by @entity74 , is a mess outside the narrow confines of her work			0
she is obsessive , bullying and intolerant but sharply intelligent			0
her initial moral qualms over torture are quickly replaced by a cold determination to do whatever it takes			0
@entity83 : oscars do n't matter but perhaps the best example of this human realism this @entity5 season is @entity89 ' definitive film portrayal of president @entity11			1
he is not portrayed as a stovepipe - hat - wearing saint , but a prairie politician -- a flawed man and a wounded giant			1
he wrestles with depression , slaps his eldest son and yells at his wife when she overindulges in histrionics over the death of a younger son			0
@entity89 ' @entity11 buoys his darker moods by telling meandering jokes that amuse him more than the listeners , infuriating his secretary of war , @entity104 , in the process			1
he is thought to be a fool by some and a despot by others			0
but above all , he is skilled in the art of power and strategic in its deployment			0
@entity11 stretches the limits of law and ethics to cobble together enough votes for the passage of the 13th amendment			1
congressmen are bribed and cajoled with the promise of lucrative new jobs			0
threats are made and some principles abandoned in the cause of building a broader coalition			0
@entity11 lies to @entity126 about the status of secret peace talks with the @entity129			2
he alone , at times , keeps in mind the larger goal of bending history toward justice , against the cruel backdrop of escalating body counts			0
the best metaphor for the movie 's more realistic viewpoint is @entity11 's voice			1
it has often been described by biographers as high - pitched with a @entity144 accent , and this was difficult to reconcile with the grave baritone we associate with the man reading the @entity149			0
but @entity89 did the research like @entity151 on a field recording and he came back with a voice that matches the biographical descriptions -- hard to imagine but instantly recognizable when finally heard			2
this @entity155 takes the risk of authenticity and takes the man off his pedestal , becoming somehow bigger for it			1
and that 's a healthy trend for movies overall			0
opinion : with @entity11 , a new frontier for @entity89 lastly , one the @entity165 missed : in an unjustly @entity5 - ignored presidential portrayal , @entity166 channeled @entity168 in " @entity169 on @entity170 , " showing the four - term president as a charming man in need			1
buoyant amid stormy weather , @entity166 's @entity168 is comfortable with maintaining multiple layers of deceit with those closest to him			0
this is capped off by intermingling romantic affairs that occasionally explode out into the open			0
it 's a reminder that great and good can be very different qualities , doled out in different amounts at different times , sometimes within the same person			0
the lesson ? you do n't have to be perfect to be a hero			1
and imperfections can actually add to heroism by virtue of authenticity			1
@entity1 's new take on politics and history invigorates because it does not hero - worship or whitewash			1
by risking realism , exposing flaws as well as moments of greatness , the inspiration of these characters becomes more accessible to us all			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : a new take on politics and realism in this year 's @entity5 crop . call it " @entity6 "
he says in " @entity9 , " " @entity10 , " " @entity155 , " films show *nuance* , humanity in characters
*day* - @entity89 , @entity206 says particularly , shows @entity11 as a flawed political *animal*
@entity206 : you do n't need to be perfect to be a hero . authenticity can add to heroism
