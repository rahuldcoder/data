@entity0 -- when @entity2 closed her arm , she felt something " very big -- like a lemon			0
" although @entity8 women have a lower incidence rate for breast cancer , they often get the diagnosis at later stages			1
her doctor said the lump in her breast was nothing , so @entity2 , who did n't have health insurance , did n't seek a second opinion			2
with two jobs and two kids , she was busy and did n't go to the doctor 's office for another year			0
during her next visit , with a different doctor , @entity2 learned she had breast cancer -- and the tumor had been there for a while			2
her story may not be particularly rare			0
research suggests that breast cancer may be harder to treat in @entity8 women because they wait longer to receive care			1
women in the fastest - growing minority group in the @entity34 face issues such as language and cultural barriers , lifestyle choices and lack of insurance that could affect their health and medical care , according to research released wednesday at the @entity45			1
like @entity2 , about half of women in a study of 230 @entity50 - @entity34 breast cancer patients in @entity51 and @entity52 noticed changes in their breasts , but waited more than a month to seek medical attention , according to research presented at the conference hosted by the @entity58			1
" we asked what the reasons were , " said @entity59 , a graduate student at the @entity60 and @entity61 , who spoke about the study			0
" a third cited they did n't have insurance or were unable to afford medical care			1
or they thought it was not important to report the medical finding to a professional			0
" other factors included fear of the results and difficulty scheduling an appointment , she said			1
more than a decade after her mastectomy , @entity2 urges @entity8 women in the @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity83 not to wait after seeing changes in their breasts			1
" i explain : take time for you to see the doctor , " she said			0
" [ some women ] do n't have insurance , do n't speak @entity91 , it 's very difficult			2
" @entity92 are the largest @entity34 minority group , constituting 14 percent of the nation 's total population			0
while @entity8 women have a lower incidence rate for breast cancer than whites , blacks and @entity101 , they have a less favorable prognosis because of delayed treatment			1
" they 're not getting more breast cancer than other women , but they 're less likely to survive as long , " said dr. @entity104 , a member of the @entity106 's @entity105 and chairwoman of the @entity108			1
" the reason is they 're diagnosed at a later stage of the cancer			0
" " we 're seeing them at later stages , so the cancer is more advanced			2
their five - year survival rates are lower than non-hispanic whites , " @entity104 said			0
@entity123 also showed that about two - thirds of breast cancer cases in the 230 @entity50 - @entity34 women were found through self - detection , which suggests that the women were not receiving routine mammogram or exams			1
@entity2 said that when she first noticed the lump , she " had no time for me to take care of myself			0
only work , work , running , no time to eat			0
sometimes you forget yourself , so there 's time for everybody and not enough for yourself			0
" at the @entity140 in @entity84 , she tells other women how she did n't take care of herself while working two jobs , 16 hours a day			2
" i explain to the ladies my experience			0
sometimes they cry and say it 's true , " @entity2 said			0
she now runs support groups for breast cancer patients , talking about health screenings , accompanying women to the hospital and helping them with paperwork			1
aside from the pressures of being a busy , working mother , there are language and cultural barriers for @entity140 women			1
" for women we work with , our focus is breast health , " said @entity160 , founder and executive director of the @entity140			2
" within @entity92 culture , within family , the husband does n't want the wife to see a male doctor			0
... that is a big deal			0
" the group partnered with public hospitals in @entity84 and @entity175 counties and made sure the medical staff who work with @entity8 breast cancer patients are female and speak @entity179			1
@entity8 women do n't take advantage of the free breast health screenings , because there 's a lack of awareness , @entity160 said			1
many women speak only @entity179 , so prevention messages in @entity91 do n't get through			0
@entity188 showed that the women with more education and exposure to english - language media , such as television and radio , were more likely to have had a mammogram			0
@entity104 said there are now public service announcements in @entity179 that target @entity8 women of all ages , so the younger ones will know the importance of family history and the older ones will become informed about the importance of mammograms			1
the @entity108 funds local efforts to increase enrollment of @entity8 women in clinical trials , provide medical interpretive and transportation services , and have @entity179 peer support for 24 - hour breast cancer hotlines			1
lifestyle choices have an important role in breast cancer development , said @entity216 , a research scientist and epidemiologist at the @entity218			2
one study that examined 2,533 @entity8 women found that the women born in foreign countries had 50 percent less risk of developing breast cancer than women born in the @entity34			1
this @entity226 compared the known breast cancer risks such as obesity , use of hormones , alcohol consumption , fat intake and lack of physical activity between the two groups and found women born in the @entity34 had greater risk			1
" the pattern suggests that when @entity8 women move to the @entity34 , there are important changes from the traditional lifestyle to the americanized lifestyle , " @entity237 said			2
" there are lifestyle factors that increase risks of breast cancer			2

@entity8 women learn of breast cancer at later stages , research shows
language , cultural barriers and lack of insurance may impede medical care
other factors include fear of results and difficulty scheduling an appointment
