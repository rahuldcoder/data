-- @entity2 's economy is booming and sheikh @entity4 's visit there this week highlights the @entity7 's ambitions to join in on this growth			1
@entity0 's @entity9 ( @entity10 ) sits down with @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , former prime minister to @entity13 to talk about the emerging relationship			1
former @entity13 prime minister @entity11 @entity11 is an expert in global banking who worked in the @entity17 for a number of years as an official for @entity20			1
he was an influential player in the process of creating a free trade agreement between @entity13 and @entity2 , after visiting the country in 2005			1
@entity11 talks about the growing ties between @entity2 and the @entity17 , and gives us inside knowledge on doing business in @entity2			1
( @entity12 ) : i think the two economies are complementary			2
@entity2 is a global economy which is growing rapidly			1
it has one of the highest growth rates in the world , and it is expanding its footprint all over the world			2
@entity36 and the @entity7 is clearly a hub for @entity38 , the @entity17 , and the whole region			1
they are a trading center , they are a financial center , and they do n't compete directly with @entity2 , in fact both economies will compliment each other			1
i think the @entity7 prime minister 's trip will help to further reinforce this and get the two countries closer together , in trade , in financial flows , in linking capital markets and many other initiatives			1
( @entity10 ) : @entity56 has been growing 30 to 40 percent over the last four years			2
but can it move beyond hard @entity2 goods going into the @entity59 ? ( @entity12 ) : of course it can			1
i think the nature of @entity36 is such that it has now become the clearing house for goods from all over the world			0
and buyers go to @entity36 and look for the best product at the best price			0
so , if @entity2 , being a large country , can bring its products to @entity36 , it will help both countries			2
may i also say that i see @entity2 evolving as an exporter of capital , not just goods because @entity2 is running huge surpluses			1
their reserves are at an all time high			0
so they are looking for investments too , and you see now a trend in @entity2 companies to buy companies overseas			1
a trend in @entity2 companies to invest overseas because they want , once they go global , they want production facilities all over the world			1
so the design and the research and development will be done in @entity2 , the components will come from @entity2 , but the manufacturing could move across the world			1
this trend is already started and i think this will all go well for both countries			0
( @entity10 ) : lets take it a step further			0
do you see @entity2 investment funds or @entity102 and @entity7 sovereign funds going out together to acquire companies in the near future ? ( @entity12 ) : sure , there have been situations where both have participated in different companies			1
( @entity10 ) : but separately			0
( @entity12 ) : separately , but i think they could join too			0
but the real issue on sovereign funds is being represented in certain quarters as if this is something which is unhelpful to the global economy			0
in my view , in an era of globalization we must open up our markets for investments and let anybody come along in line with the rules of that country			0
may i say that the sovereignty of any country is a very robust concept			2
and if a foreign sovereign fund or investor comes along and buys a bank in a particular country , the countries sovereignty is never jeopardized			2
but , if you have good regulators and good policies , because even in a deregulated environment , regulation is necessary			0
@entity139 does not mean abdication by the government , so if your regulatory regime is sound , you do n't have to worry			0
sovereign funds have demonstrated that they have helped promote economic activity , help save certain companies , banks as a case in point			0
and it 's a win - win for both sides			0
so i think this question of their role is over stated			0
( @entity10 ) : @entity156 's @entity155 went to visit @entity2 when he came into power in early 2006			2
is itinevitable that @entity159 - @entity158 in the @entity59 turn to the @entity17 now and look for new partnerships in an @entity162 equation ? ( @entity12 ) : this is the fastest growing economy in the world			2
it is absorbing foreign investment , it is exporting investment			1
it is the largest producer of goods and services now , in terms of growth rate			0
so @entity156 , naturally , the largest economy in the @entity17 by a long margin , needs to link up a country like @entity2			1
i think it is not geo - politics which is driving it			0
it is tapping into growth			0
@entity156 companies are investing in @entity2			2
i know that in the energy sector @entity184 has gone in for joint ventures and maybe @entity187 too , and that is to me a very positive development			0
because it is showing that capital looks for opportunities and if there is return @entity2 is not far enough			1

@entity11 , former @entity13 prime minister talks with @entity9
@entity11 sees *compatibility* between @entity17 and @entity2 economies
@entity2 surpluses may allow exporting of capital for overseas manufacturing
@entity11 believes regulated foreign investment does not put sovereignty at risk
