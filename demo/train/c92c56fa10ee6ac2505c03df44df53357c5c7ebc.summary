-- @entity1 began deploying pressure sensors on its ruptured undersea well in the @entity4 on sunday in an effort to fine - tune estimates of the worst oil spill in @entity9 history , government and company officials said			1
@entity1 used remote - controlled submarines to begin positioning the sensors inside the well , located 5,000 feet below the surface of the @entity4 , company spokesman @entity13 said			1
the sensors were requested by federal experts who have been trying to gauge how much oil has been pouring from the well , which experts say could have been spewing as much as 1.7 million gallons of oil a day into the @entity4			1
but @entity13 said the devices may not yield accurate information for several days			0
" it 's not as if they 'll plug these sensors in and get readings right away , " he said			2
researchers recently doubled estimates of how much oil has been flowing from the ruptured well , saying last week that up to 40,000 barrels -- or 1.7 million gallons -- a day may have leaked for weeks			0
@entity33 adm. @entity32 , the @entity35 administration 's point man on the disaster , said the sensors will help give those researchers a better picture of the flow rate			1
" we think we need some independent pressure readings to validate the estimates that have been made by the scientists looking at the video and some other acoustic data , " @entity32 said sunday on @entity41 's " @entity40			2
" @entity32 's deputy , rear adm. @entity47 , has given @entity1 until sunday to provide alternative plans that adequately address substantially higher rates of oil flow			1
the company said saturday that it was reviewing a letter from @entity47 , but no response had been disclosed late sunday			2
the oil is believed to have been pouring into the @entity4 since the april 20 explosion that sank the offshore drill rig @entity57 , killing 11 workers			1
the spill now dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into @entity61 's @entity60 when the tanker @entity63 ran aground in 1989 , and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
@entity32 said the battle against the oil " continues to widen , " with efforts now being focused on the stretch of open water between the wellhead and about 15 miles off the coast			0
" rather than trying to capture all around the well head , we 've got to get our skimmers further offshore and protect it so we minimize the amount of oil that comes ashore , " he said			0
@entity32 's comments came on the eve of president @entity35 's fourth scheduled visit to the stricken @entity4 region , a two - day trip that will be followed by a tuesday night address to the nation			1
@entity35 is scheduled to visit @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 on monday and tuesday , then meet with @entity1 executives on wednesday			1
@entity1 has captured some of the gushing oil through a containment cap that has been pumping the crude up to a drilling ship for about a week			1
@entity1 said it collected more than 15,000 barrels of oil on saturday and more than 7,700 by noon sunday			1
but despite this advancement , pressure has not been removed from @entity1			1
@entity101 adviser @entity100 said sunday the @entity35 administration wants @entity1 to set up a massive , independently administered fund for cleaning up the oil - stricken gulf states			1
" the president will use every legal device at his disposal to make sure that this money is escrowed and that there is an independent administrator so that claims are not slow - walked , people can get the relief they need in a timely fashion and that we do n't create more victims from this terrible disaster , " @entity100 told reporters			0
he said administration lawyers have advised " that we have the authority to compel such an escrow fund , if it comes to that			0
" estimates of the cleanup costs and the damages @entity1 will owe to businesses and residents on the @entity129 range from $ 3 billion to $ 40 billion			1
@entity1 said it already has spent more than $ 1 billion trying to cap the spill and clean up the areas affected by the oil			1
@entity100 did not discuss how much money might be set up in the fund			0
but @entity32 told @entity41 that @entity1 was " a company that 's got a lot of wealth inside it			2
" and a group of 54 @entity139 -- nearly all the @entity141 caucus -- has called on @entity1 to put $ 20 billion in trust for the spill			2
in a letter to the oil company 's ceo , @entity146 , they note that the 1989 @entity148 in @entity61 's @entity60 cost $ 7 billion , but @entity149 paid far less for damages while continuing to make major profits			0
@entity70 gov. @entity152 told @entity0 's " @entity154 " on sunday that he did n't care how the money was paid out			1
but he said @entity1 owed " every one " of his state 's @entity129 businesses			2
" i do n't think there is a dividing line , " said @entity152 , a @entity158			0
" i do n't think you can say that one group is going to get it and another one does n't			0
if a restaurant in @entity166 , @entity70 , is off 50 percent because the tourists did n't come , i think he is owed 50 percent of his revenues from last year			2
" the same thing with anyone in these areas , because the whole economy is based on the tourist market , " he said			0
" and when it goes away , someone 's got to compensate them , because most of these people are not going to be here next year if we do n't			0
" @entity152 also criticized the @entity35 administration 's handling of the disaster , saying the " unified command " set up with the federal government and @entity1 is mounting a disjointed response			1
" you ca n't have a committee making the decisions that are going to impact this entire coastal area			0
you ca n't have someone come in and say , ' well , if it gets onto the beach , we 'll clean it up and we 'll clean it up rapidly , ' and then @entity198 come in and say , ' well , the people ca n't work but 20 minutes out of an hour or two hours a day , ' and get it cleaned up			0
someone is going to have to be in charge of each one of these operations , " he said			0
@entity152 , @entity69 gov. @entity204 and @entity71 gov. @entity205 are scheduled to meet with the president during his two - day visit			0
@entity204 told @entity41 he was pleased to hear @entity32 talk of trying to fight the oil offshore rather than on the beaches , but said he would push @entity35 to end the six - month moratorium he slapped on offshore oil exploration since the disaster began			1
@entity35 has said no drilling should go forward until investigators determine the cause of the explosion aboard the @entity57			2
but @entity204 said @entity35 " is going to hurt the national economy " if the temporary ban is n't lifted			2
" there have been more than 30,000 oil wells drilled in the @entity4 in the last 50 years			2
this is the first time something like this has ever happened			0
and we need to get to the bottom of it , find out what happened , make sure it does n't happen again			0
but i think it is very reasonable to continue to drill , " @entity204 said .			0
