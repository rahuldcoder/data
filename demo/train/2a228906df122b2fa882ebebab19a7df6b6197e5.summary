-- the buildup of separatist forces in @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity6 's patently confrontational tone are raising the specter of another offensive in eastern @entity4 before winter grips the region			1
on wednesday , @entity11 warned that " columns of @entity14 equipment , primarily @entity14 tanks , @entity14 artillery , @entity14 air defense systems and @entity14 combat troops " had been spotted entering @entity4			1
is this crisis about to flare up again , just two months after @entity14 withdrew its forces ? given the strategic costs , it might seem unlikely that @entity14 would reignite this war , especially with winter looming			1
yet both the opportunity and the motivation appear to be there in @entity6			1
the invasion of @entity4 and confrontation with the @entity30 have whipped up nationalist sentiment , but @entity14 has run out of foreign policy victories to feed to the fire			1
that might explain why @entity6 is aggravating @entity11 with airspace violations and playing alleged underwater games with @entity37 , moves that appear aimed at keeping the @entity14 public in a confrontational mood			1
@entity14 plans bomber flights over @entity42 the problem for @entity14 president @entity44 is that none of this is likely to sustain his astronomical approval ratings or keep economic woes from chipping away at public support for the @entity4 adventure			1
another motivating factor could be that @entity53 separatists simply do not control enough of the @entity54 , the populous region that includes @entity3 , to have made this conflict worthwhile for @entity14			2
the territory controlled by them looks awfully small in comparison to lofty talk of re-establishing a grand @entity61 , and the ceasefire line of control left many separatist home cities under @entity4 control , so the separatists seem keen to fight for the rest			0
all this means that the current line of control looks more like a stopping point than the desirable outlines of a frozen conflict for @entity14			2
of course , for @entity6 's policy aims , the smarter approach would be to keep @entity4 in a permanent state of crisis and use this foothold to maintain pressure on @entity79			1
however , domestic political considerations and the militarily advantageous position of @entity53 separatists are themselves compelling arguments for a surprise winter offensive			0
why should @entity44 put off until tomorrow the parts of @entity4 that he can conquer today ? @entity14 provocations : a new @entity86 ? the separatist force now numbers anywhere between 20,000 and 25,000 , half of whom are likely locals , with the other half composed of @entity14 volunteers and fighting groups from the @entity95 , particularly @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98			2
many of the fighters from the @entity95 will go home for the winter if there is nothing for them to do in @entity4			0
this suggests that the ideal time to use them in a bid to gain more territory is now , rather than trying to regroup these fighters next year for another season of conflict			0
@entity14 , for its part , used the ceasefire to drastically increase the separatist stores of equipment and ammunition			2
convoys arrive regularly bringing munitions			0
meanwhile a good deal of captured @entity4 armor is being restored by the separatists themselves inside repair facilities they control			0
conversely , @entity4 's army is in a period of consolidation and has lost a large portion of its best equipment , perhaps 60 % according to president @entity130			0
the country just fired its third defense minister			0
volunteer battalions , the country 's most motivated force , are in a period of reorganization			0
and since the signing of the ceasefire , @entity4 has lost many of its best soldiers inside the meat grinder that @entity3 airport has become			0
one of the primary constraints on @entity6 in this shadowy war has been the lack of public support for @entity14 casualties in @entity4			1
it meant any invasion would have to be brief , decisive , and with few losses in order to be tolerable at home			0
if the separatists are sufficiently armed , trained and supported that they can seize territory without the need for @entity14 regulars , then there is much less for @entity6 to risk			1
still , seizing more territory would come at great cost elsewhere for @entity6			2
@entity14 's economy is badly creaking from the drop in oil prices			2
meanwhile , the central bank is failing to contain inflation , while the government has to find a way to roll over billions in corporate debt for companies that no longer have access to the @entity173 financial system due to sanctions			0
another military intervention by @entity6 would probably result in further @entity173 sanctions on sectors of the @entity14 economy , meaning @entity44 could lose any hope of driving a wedge between @entity181 to reverse the current sanctions in place			1
starting another campaign in @entity4 would mean a new spiral of unpredictable events -- yet @entity6 's calculations might be based on a different reading of the situation			2
for a start , sanctions are not the source of @entity14 's economic woes , but more a humiliating annoyance			1
in the winter , @entity14 has a comparative advantage in economic reprisals , because it can threaten gas cutoffs to @entity181 in retaliation for new sanctions			1
@entity4 's energy dependence and broken economy , along with relatively weak @entity173 promises of financial aid , suggest that @entity79 would have to sue for peace no matter what @entity6 does			0
and what does @entity14 gain from maintaining the peace anyway ? it will not raise the price of oil or stop ruble speculation , and the @entity212 does not appear keen to start rolling back sanctions , even though it genuinely needs @entity14 cooperation on @entity215 , @entity216 , and @entity217 in the @entity218			0
now that @entity219 have regained control of the @entity221 , @entity14 knows there is little it can practically do to lift the sanctions anyway			0
illegitimate elections in the separatist regions and the massing of @entity14 forces only reinforce the impression that @entity6 has no interest in implementing the @entity231 agreement or in reconciliation with the @entity30			1
and while it is true that a renewed quest to widen separatist - held territory would be a reckless adventure , fraught with costs for everyone involved , reckless foreign policy risk seems to be the new normal in @entity14			1
now a winter offensive is far from unthinkable .			0

@entity6 is striking a patently confrontational tone , says @entity244
@entity14 economic woes could impact foreign policy , he writes
@entity244 : reckless foreign policy risk the new normal in @entity14
