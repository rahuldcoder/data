-- for several months in 2003 , i did the whole @entity3 backpacker thing			2
which is to say i 've seen nearly every cathedral within 1,000 square miles of the @entity6			2
" are we cultured yet ? " " shut up			2
" it also means that i have an old journal filled out in the back with countless e-mail addresses from travelers i 'll probably never see again			2
this was before the heyday of social media , back when pretending to care about people you just met required considerably less effort			2
because now when you go abroad , you actually have to connect with your fellow travelers over @entity20			1
and then deny their @entity22 requests			1
well , these casual travel friendships are about to go completely bonkers over the next two weekends as the world - famous @entity27 festival kicks off in @entity29			1
i 'll get to why in a moment , but for those of you who are unfamiliar with @entity27 , it 's a multiday gathering of thousands upon thousands of beautiful young people from all over the planet , congregating in a fairytale - themed field , dancing all night to djs playing @entity37			1
( note to @entity38 : @entity37 stands for @entity37			2
it sounds nothing like @entity40			2
just put on the @entity41 and stay away from @entity29			1
) that said , if you 're not my dad and actually enjoy @entity37 , it 's probably a great time			0
especially if you 're into that whole being young and enjoying life thing			0
i 'd go , but my @entity48 has me scheduled to wallow in self - doubt			1
( the following weekend is also completely booked with some pre-planned lower back pain			0
) however , if you do make it over to @entity29 , this year you 'll be wearing a special festival bracelet that allows you to instantly send friend requests to people you just met			1
" you get a friend request			1
you get a friend request			1
you get a friend request			1
@entity58 gets a friend request ! " now , because this festival is so delightfully wackadoo , these bracelets literally arrive at your door in a @entity27 treasure case , which , from what i 've seen online , is far more ornate than anything i currently have in my house			1
you see , this festival tends to go all - in on the ridiculous			1
they 've made it fun before you even get there			0
an instructional web video from @entity27 explains that , once your treasure case arrives in the mail , you have to use a " magical key " to " unlock the happiness			1
" then , inside the box , you 'll find your bracelet , for which you have to go online to activate with a personalized code			0
next , to " fully unleash all its magical power , " you connect it to your @entity20 account			1
and if everything syncs up as it should , the bracelet is then armed for making instant friends			0
back in my day , we used cheap bourbon and old war stories			0
somehow , i just turned 72			0
but at @entity27 , you and your new pal just need to be near each other while you press your " heart " buttons at the same time			1
the next day , you 'll receive a daily " special friendship " e-mail with all the contact details of your new late - night besties			1
" who the hell is @entity108 ? " " he 's that crazy @entity109 guy with no pants			0
you spent six hours with him building a glow stick castle			0
" " oh , @entity112			0
" so , who knows what kind of new digital friends you 'll suddenly make			0
you can even play port - a - potty roulette with the person using the stall next to yours			1
" i do n't know who you are over there , or what you just ate , but ... one			0
go ! " what 's also cool is that the bracelet is actually your entrance pass to the festival			1
and that 's sort of the new trend in ticketing : high - tech smart bracelets			1
in fact , this year , @entity138 in @entity139 is going cashless by using radio frequency identification - enabled wristband tickets that also allow festival - goers to make payments			1
the bracelets are linked to the user 's credit card			2
which , after far too many beers , probably sounds like this : " i 'll take a poster			0
and a t - shirt			2
and another t - shirt for that guy			2
and whatever this chick wants			0
and let 's do another poster			0
" what could possibly go wrong ? anyway , things have certainly changed since i promised to keep in touch with all those people i met back in @entity3			0
but this is just life as we know it in our crazy modern world			0
you up for another glow stick castle ? " follow @ @entity171 on @entity172			0
