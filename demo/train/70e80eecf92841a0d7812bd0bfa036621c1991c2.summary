-- " it 's like building a @entity2 garden at @entity3 or a big swastika in @entity5			1
" " @entity7 " is livid			2
he 's voiced his opinion , no holds barred , on several @entity11 videos concerning the proposed construction of an @entity14 cultural center a few blocks from ground zero in @entity17			1
his comments are blatantly anti-islamic in nature and express a deep resentment toward the @entity22 faith			1
in a comment posted on an online video advertisement in opposition to the @entity14 center , @entity27 -- an online pseudonym -- calls for the bombing of all mosques in the western world			1
in a comment on a different video , he calls for the annihilation of all @entity22			2
but he 'd only say this online			1
the 39 - year - old relies on his cloak of anonymity to shield him from what he believes is the certain scorn he 'd face if he uttered these words in public			1
in fact , @entity7 is a pseudonym for his @entity11 alias			2
he wears two layers of armor			2
" i do n't think i would say this in open due to restrictions			2
i have a business and can not afford to speak freely in our days of freedom of speech			2
haha , what a big joke actually , if you think about it , " says @entity56 , in an e-mail from @entity58 , where he currently resides			0
" political correctness is killing everything freedom stands for			0
" as sites such as @entity11 , @entity69 and @entity70 become increasingly popular , they are rapidly becoming havens for people who want to speak openly about race , politics and religion without damage to reputation			0
anyone can fake a name and voice an opinion -- no matter how controversial -- without any threat to their reputation			0
that ability is one of the driving forces behind the prevalence of hate speech on the web , says @entity91 , director of @entity92 , @entity94 - based @entity93 , a website that advocates online civil liberties			1
the controversy surrounding plans to build an @entity14 center just a few blocks from the @entity102 site has spawned aggressive and candid outpourings of online sentiment			1
those outpourings are collectively making a case - in - point study of how the internet has spawned a wide - open , frequently anonymous forum for declarations that can easily be considered offensive or hateful by some			1
" this is what has occurred in the case of the @entity14 center -- a shift in society 's acceptability of openly expressing ethnic prejudice , " says dr. @entity111 , a psychiatrist at @entity112 in @entity17			1
one @entity69 group in opposition to the @entity14 center has about 90,000 members			1
even though the 13 - story center is planned to include a pool , auditorium and prayer area , the group , like many of its counterparts , refers to the building simply as a mosque			1
the @entity69 group , called " no to the @entity134 at @entity135 " , has become one of the largest opposition groups on the site			0
@entity139 ( the only social mediate who let @entity6 use her name ) joined because she is against the proposed cultural center			1
she points out that the group has " shifted its focus from ' stop the mosque being built ' to ' all @entity22 are evil terrorists			0
' " @entity148 , @entity69 's manager of public policy communications says the site does not knowingly allow anonymity and tries to respond to hate speech as quickly as possible			1
" @entity69 has always been based on a real - name culture			0
this leads to greater accountability and a safer and more trusted environment for our users			1
it 's a violation of our policies to use a fake name or operate under a false identity , " he says			1
but where there are rules , there are rule benders and breakers , and some accounts that use pseudonyms			0
" regarding the broader issue of controversial content that may appear on the site , i wonder how the phone company would answer a question about preventing threatening phone calls ? and webmail providers about threatening e-mails ? " adds @entity148			0
" just as none of those communications platforms can guarantee their tools wo n't be misused , neither can we			0
" in an e-mail response , a @entity11 spokesperson also references the site 's size when explaining the prevalence of hateful comments on uploaded videos			1
" with 24 hours of video uploaded every minute to @entity11 , it is not possible to prescreen content and operate at the scale we do			0
it would be like the telephone company prescreening every call before allowing it to be connected			0
" even though some choose to use their real identities , there are still a great number of anonymous comments on @entity11 and @entity70 , even on @entity69 where some create alternate profiles from which they comment in controversial groups			0
these sites have become forums that cater to specific parts of the population -- those with strong opinions who want to maintain reputation			1
however , the thinking behind some of these anonymous comments could be more complex			0
dr. @entity219 , director of adult psychiatry residency training at @entity221 in @entity222 , @entity223 , believes the idea of " reciprocal altruism " may contribute to the prevalence of negative comments in this situation			0
" we really are evolved for treating people well , but with the idea that we 'll get something in return			0
everyone has had some experience of being hurt and that hurt leads to hostility			0
that triggers the response of wanting to protect one 's self , and making the other hurt in return is one way , " says @entity219			2
for groups that monitor social media websites for hate speech , one of the main concerns is how accessible prejudiced comments are to kids			0
according to 2010 data gathered by @entity253 , a popular web analytics company , about 22 per cent of @entity255 @entity11 and @entity69 users are ages 3 to 17			2
on @entity11 , inappropriate and discriminatory comments are common			0
there are videos in which users ask others to stop spreading the hateful speech , and even @entity262 , the popular , editable , pseudo-dictionary frequented by high school and college students , has a definition for the term " @entity267			1
" on @entity69 , many groups against the @entity14 center are public , which means anyone can access them , even without a @entity69 account			1
@entity111 says negative and unfounded comments posted about @entity14 and its followers can confuse children who are growing up in @entity22 households			1
" when [ kids ] see videos with blatant misinformation on the internet , they may not have the cognitive ability to determine the representative nature of those statements [ and ] they are not trained to challenge it , " says @entity111			2
@entity287 , the @entity289 's @entity288 regional director , says the same goes for any religion			2
" these messages are directed at young people whose religious values have not yet taken root			0
it can cause them a lot of anxiety and ... it worries us , " he says			0
@entity287 says the @entity289 routinely sends messages to @entity69 regarding anti-semitic remarks			0
he references one instance where he received a complaint that a 12 - year - old girl was called a " dirty jew " on her @entity69 page			0
meanwhile @entity7 -- the @entity11 user whose diatribes against the proposed @entity14 center near ground zero now live online -- has a 13 - year - old child			1
and despite the no - holds - barred comments that he 's made , he says he has just one wish			2
" peace to you and the whole world , man ! because in the end , that 's all i want			2

online anonymity allows internet users to express opinions without *reservation*
experts say it 's also leading to more hateful sentiments expressed online
