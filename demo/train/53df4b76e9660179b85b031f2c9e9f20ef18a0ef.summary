@entity0 -- reports the @entity4 is on the verge of a security agreement with @entity7 that includes a formal letter of apology for past mistakes by @entity4 troops are completely false , the @entity3 adviser told @entity1 on tuesday			1
the statements came amid claims by @entity7 officials that the @entity16 administration offered to write the letter as part of an effort to keep a small number of @entity4 troops in @entity7 well past the 2014 deadline to withdraw			1
" no such letter has been drafted or delivered			0
there is not a need for the @entity4 to apologize to @entity7 , " national security adviser @entity24 said on @entity1 's " @entity25			1
" " quite the contrary , we have sacrificed and supported them in their democratic progress and in tackling the insurgents and @entity34			0
so that ( letter of apology ) is not on the table			0
" @entity38 said she has seen news reports but has no idea where they are coming from , describing the claims as a " complete misunderstanding of what the situation is			0
" the claim first surfaced following talks tuesday between @entity4 secretary of state @entity49 and @entity7 president @entity50 , when @entity50 's spokesman told reporters that @entity49 said president @entity16 would write an official letter guaranteeing the @entity4 would not repeat " past mistakes " that led to civilian casualties			1
asked later about such a letter , @entity57 spokeswoman @entity56 said , " i do n't have anything to tell you about whether there will or wo n't be a letter			0
" the conversation between @entity50 and @entity49 came ahead of a meeting of @entity7 leaders -- known as a @entity66 -- to potentially sign off on a deal that would allow a limited number of @entity4 troops to stay to train @entity7 security services			1
@entity49 declined an invitation to attend to the @entity66 , but offered to write a letter to the leaders offering @entity4 assurances about a future security relationship , said two senior @entity4 officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
the letter @entity49 offered would also clarify the @entity4 position on past issues , such as civilian casualties and a pledge to do everything possible to avoid them , said one of the officials			1
but the letter in no way would be offered as an apology , both officials said			2
@entity93 spokesman @entity92 said a " general agreement " between the two countries was reached last month			2
there have been talks in the weeks since " to finalize the text , " he said			0
opium poppy cultivation rises to new levels in @entity7 @entity38 said the @entity4 was in the last stages of negotiations on a framework that @entity49 and @entity50 signed off on last month during talks			2
" without such an agreement , that level of cooperation would be all but impossible			0
" @entity50 's office issued a statement spelling out some points of contention , including the @entity7 government 's opposition to raids " on any @entity7 homes by @entity4 forces , " while @entity0 wants to be able to conduct such operations " in exceptional circumstances			1
" according to the statement , @entity50 proposed two alternatives : -- have @entity49 himself make the case for military raids when the @entity66 convenes later this week -- do n't sign any bilateral security agreement until a new @entity7 government takes shape after the upcoming presidential election , set for next april @entity50 agrees to new deadline for prison handover @entity92 acknowledged military raids were an issue , calling them a matter of concern for both countries			1
@entity4 troops were deployed to @entity7 following the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , which were coordinated by @entity34 leaders then based in the country			2
@entity16 has vowed to reduce @entity4 troop levels in @entity7 , with the goal to end the @entity4 combat mission by the end of 2014 several military and @entity146 officials have told @entity1 that one option now being considered calls for a total @entity150 force of 8,000 to 12,000 troops , with 3,000 to 4,000 coming from @entity150 countries , and the @entity4 providing up the balance of troops			2
while the final numbers could change , a senior @entity156 official said it 's not likely to change by much			0
if fewer than 8,000 were to stay , relatively few would be able to engage in actual missions			0
