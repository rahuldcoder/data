@entity13 made his mark by reinventing @entity19 and has since done the same for @entity20 , to much acclaim			1
@entity12 , meanwhile , is comic book royalty			1
not only did he work on @entity15 , his father did in the early days of the character as well			1
this new supercreative team has built up anticipation among fans for " @entity6 " # 32 , which hits stores on june 25			1
the issue introduces @entity30 , who is something of an equal , and a reflection of @entity6			1
but perhaps not is all as it seems			1
meanwhile , @entity34 tries to get @entity35 to return to the @entity36			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity12 about diving into the world of the @entity39			1
( @entity1 is owned by @entity40 , which also owns @entity0			2
) @entity0 : what was it like when you first started work on @entity6 ? @entity12 : there was a self - imposed nervousness , and i felt intimidated			1
no one gave me the impression that it was daunting , i just do that myself			2
i get nervous anticipation when i get ready to play softball , so this was the same thing			1
honestly , everybody was very encouraging			2
my father signed off on it , saying " yeah , try something different			2
" but my mind started to collapse on itself			2
once i started , i felt much more comfortable in it			2
once i got the pencil to paper , and read the amazing script , i felt so much more comfortable			2
@entity0 : have you tried to put your own take on @entity6 ? @entity12 : not necessarily			1
one drawback to drawing @entity6 is it 's been done so many times that you ca n't really differentiate the style			1
i just wanted him to look 6 - foot - 5 and 250 pounds of solid muscle			2
you ca n't go light on that			2
you have to give him that powerful presence			0
you tweak the body language and the weight on the floor			0
there 's a strict way the face should look , the hair is drawn a certain way			0
the only thing i like to do is convey the weight and the power of the figure , especially with a character like this			0
i was told to draw @entity15 in a very awkward sort of way because he 's not a very graceful character			0
and here we have this very graceful , elegant , powerful character			0
when he flies there 's the cape behind him and all that			0
this is the whole ball of wax			0
@entity0 : do you have plans to change @entity6 in some way down the road ? @entity12 : that will possibly happen later on			1
right now , we 're following through on the costume designed by @entity105			0
while there are limitations to redesigning @entity6 's costume , his costume will be destroyed eventually , because he 's doing cosmic stuff			1
but remember , we 're dealing with the big s on the front , the big s on the back and the cape , so we 'll be careful not to get too far from that iconic figure			0
however , it does n't mean i ca n't throw in some influence the way @entity105 did on his			0
@entity0 : now that you 've had the chance to work on him , do you have new insight into why @entity6 has lasted 76 years ? @entity12 : i could n't tell you why anything lasts that long , other than that it 's a great representation of a hero			1
the way the character has been done all these years had its ups and downs like any series			0
recently , the past 20 years , it 's been done how it should be done : he does fail , he does get the snot beat out of him			0
i think that 's the key to the character because none of us are infallible			0
his weak point over the past 76 years is when he was infallible			0
the realization that this is a superhero to the nth degree that has to struggle with real life is what comics are all about			0
@entity0 : do you have a favorite supporting character ? @entity12 : out of the normal , down - to - earth characters , i 'd like to see what happens with @entity153 , because she 's a bit different now			1
i like the female characters because i feel like it 's more difficult for male artists and writers to handle the female characters			1
@entity160 is a real kid , @entity153 is a real hustler at work			0
there 's a new character i 'd never seen before named @entity165 , and i 'd like to see how we explore her .			0
