in the @entity3 , a congressman is broadening the oversight of a previous inquiry to include the most recent allegations			2
@entity16 , a federal senator with @entity6 's ruling @entity18 party , says they will demand an investigation to determine whether the @entity21 allowed its agents to launder money , possibly even on @entity6 soil , as part of an investigation into the inner workings of @entity6 drug cartels			1
@entity16 called the situation " really , really bad " and said that " this is not increasing the trust among countries to work together against crime			2
furthermore , you ca n't fight crime by committing criminal acts and violating the law			1
" last weekend , the @entity37 reported that @entity21 agents " have handled shipments of hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal cash across borders			2
" rep. @entity42 , @entity43 , announced monday an investigation into the allegations in his role as chairman of the @entity48			0
in a letter to @entity3 attorney general @entity50 , @entity42 said , " these allegations , if true , raise further unsettling questions about a @entity54 component engaging in a high - risk strategy with scant evidence of success			2

@entity77 , a former @entity21 agent , says infiltration of @entity6 drug cartels is not only happening , but it 's essential in investigations aimed at dismantling @entity6 criminal organizations by targeting their finances			1
" there 's only one way really to catch these major drug cartels , the leaders of these cartels , and that 's to follow the money , because these leaders do n't go anywhere near the drugs themselves			1
they hire people to do that , " @entity77 said			0
as an answer to he allegations published by @entity100 , the @entity21 issued a statement tuesday saying , " we do not discuss the operational aspects of law enforcement activities			0

as a result of this cooperation , we have seized illicit transnational criminal organization money all around the world through our partnership with law enforcement			0
" for @entity77 , the former @entity21 agent , the bottom line is whether these actions produce results			1
