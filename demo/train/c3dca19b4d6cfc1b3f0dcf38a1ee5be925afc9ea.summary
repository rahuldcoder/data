@entity0 , @entity1 -- a man convicted of killing a mother and her two daughters during a brutal 2007 @entity1 home invasion can be " quite likable , " but has struggled with drug addiction for years , a defense attorney told jurors monday			1
the same jurors who convicted @entity11 of capital murder and other charges convened monday for @entity11 ' penalty phase			1
they will decide whether he should be sentenced to death for the slayings of @entity11 and her daughters , 17 - year - old @entity11 and 11 - year - old @entity11			1
attorney @entity19 told jurors in his opening statement they will hear testimony from " people who know @entity24 , whose lives have crossed paths with @entity11 ... to try to give you some insight , some understanding of who @entity11 was prior to the crimes of july 23 , 2007			1
" some of the testimony , he warned , will not be flattering to @entity11 , but he said that despite his long history of criminal convictions and drug abuse , @entity11 could be " quite likable			1
" " there is no presumption at this point that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment , " @entity19 said			1
" ... you must keep an open mind			1
" @entity19 said testimony would also focus on @entity11 ' behavior in prison in the past , noting that he has been incarcerated for " most of his adult life " because of his addiction			1
" at the conclusion [ of testimony ] , you 'll come to know much more of the ' who ' about @entity11 , " @entity19 told jurors			1
" ... hopefully , you 'll also have a fuller understanding of his role in these crimes ... these most horrible and tragic crimes			0
" @entity11 , 47 , was convicted earlier this month of 16 of the 17 charges against him , including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping			2
jurors acquitted him of an arson charge			0
during the penalty phase , jurors will determine whether the mitigating evidence the defense is expected to present outweighs the aggravating factors in favor of the death penalty			1
jurors are allowed to consider evidence they heard during the guilt phase of the trial			0
they can also consider new testimony or evidence that attorneys introduce during the sentencing phase -- which might include the defendant 's long history of prior convictions and anything that casts @entity11 in a positive light			1
" all of the evidence presented in the guilt phase may be considered in this phase ... and the state is relying on that evidence , " prosecutor @entity85 told jurors in his opening statement			0
the only new testimony presented in the penalty phase by the prosecution concerned @entity11 ' prior convictions -- two in 1981 and others in 1993 , 1996 and 2003 , all for third - degree burglary			1
the prosecution rested just before the court took a lunch break monday			0
the killings took place in the @entity0 suburb of @entity107 , a brutal attack that shocked the well - to - do community and drew nationwide attention			0
the home of dr. @entity11 was invaded in the middle of the night by @entity11 and another man , @entity11 , prosecutors say			2
@entity116 will be tried separately			0
@entity1 state police detective @entity117 , who interviewed @entity11 after the crime , has testified that the duo beat @entity120 bloody and left him in the basement			2
according to testimony , the two men then went upstairs and found @entity120 and @entity124 asleep in the master bedroom			0
after tying @entity120 to her bed , they led the girl to her room , tied her to her bed and put a pillowcase over her head , @entity11 told @entity117			2
they then found @entity11 in her room and did the same , he said			2
after finding evidence of a bank account containing $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 , they decided to have the mother go to the bank in the morning and withdraw money from her account , @entity117 testified			0
@entity11 is accused of taking @entity120 to the bank while @entity116 allegedly stayed behind			0
when @entity11 and @entity120 returned with the money , the two men allegedly set the home on fire and fled			0
inside the home , authorities said , @entity120 , 48 , was found raped and strangled			0
her two daughters , one of whom had been sexually assaulted , died of smoke inhalation			0
@entity120 , the sole survivor , escaped to a neighbor 's home			0
@entity11 has said he will not offer a victim impact statement during @entity11 ' penalty phase , saying in a statement he " regretfully " decided against doing so because @entity1 's law on victim impact statements is unclear and could provide convicts with grounds to appeal their sentences			1
@entity19 noted in his remarks to jurors monday that " there was another person involved in this crime : @entity11			1
" he said jurors will hear about @entity116 in the suspect 's own words , much of it from his writings to author @entity171			0
judge @entity172 has suggested the penalty proceeding could last as long as four weeks , though the relatively quick pace of the guilt phase of @entity11 ' trial has led some to speculate the penalty phase could also be quick			2
@entity11 ' attorneys had sought to introduce testimony regarding the comparative cost of life imprisonment versus execution , but @entity183 barred the subject .			2
