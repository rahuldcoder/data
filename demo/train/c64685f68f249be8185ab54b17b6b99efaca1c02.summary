-- from unauthorized dates to drunken massage parlor trips , some of @entity3 's biggest k - pop stars have been giving the military a bad name -- and now the top brass has had enough			1
in a country where the mandatory two - year military service for all males is a big deal , the suggestion that celebrity recruits have been enjoying preferential treatment has created a fierce nationwide backlash			1
in addition to leading the top trending subjects on all nationwide news portals , social media and news sites were swamped by angry user comments , while military barracks rumbled with soldiers ' complaints			2
so last week the @entity27 announced it would be scrapping its celebrity soldier unit			2
" although we initially formed the unit to promote the military , a number of unfortunate incidents damaged the public image of the military and lowered the morale of all the regular soldiers who are in the service , " said the ministry 's vice-spokesperson @entity29 at a press conference			1
preferential treatment on january 1 this year , @entity3 awoke to paparazzi photos that showed @entity44 was secretly dating top actress @entity45			0
@entity44 landed himself in hot water because he was halfway through his military service and his secret liaisons involved special leave that is not given to regular soldiers , as well as civilian contact -- which is not permitted during duty			2
no more miniskirts in @entity55 ? new law has @entity57 buzzing last month , a local tv crew secretly taped a group of celebrity soldiers , including @entity44 and fellow @entity61 , drinking together in a private restaurant following a performance to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of the @entity65			0
adding insult to injury , two of the celebs , @entity68 and @entity69 , then reportedly broke away from the group to visit an illegal massage parlor , which was also broadcast on national tv			2
the backlash was immediate and furious , with the public demanding disciplinary action and musing about the integrity of military service			1
" this news about @entity68 and @entity69 is a sign of the lack of military discipline even during the 20 - month service period			1
and so the degeneration of the military service will continue , " tweeted well - known lawyer @entity85 - ho			2
in the barracks soldiers currently serving in the army were particularly disgruntled			0
" the news made everyone very angry in the barracks , " said @entity91 - min @entity45 , 24 , whose army service ended in may			0
" the question we were all asking was ' why do they get to have that kind of special treatment ? ' " some even questioned their entertainment value			1
" what soldiers would like to see for those special concerts are the girl groups and not some male singer , " said @entity103 , 29 , who was recently discharged from the @entity104			0
the fallout with the closure of their unit , the 16 celebrity soldiers will be sent to regular military units -- with eight of them facing punishment for violating military rules			1
in the past , punishment for a similar offense ranged from reduced leave to a spell in a military jail			0
two members are being deployed to units in the provinces -- which will come as a rude shock after their relatively cushy desk job in the capital			0
the history first formed 16 years ago , the celebrity unit acted as the military 's public relations office , and was comprised of singers , actors and comedians who used their various " skills " in public capacities such as concerts for soldiers or military broadcasts			1
however , the issue of celebrities enlisting in the military has long been a controversial subject in @entity3			2
with the popularity of @entity3 entertainment soaring overseas , some say that the k - pop stars and actors should be exempt from army service due to the substantial foreign revenue they bring into the country			1
in a similar vein , athletes are exempted from army service if they medal at the @entity156 or win gold medals in the @entity158			0
but it tends to be a more sensitive issue when it comes to entertainers			0
famous cases psy is one of the most high - profile cases -- the " @entity168 " star famously repeated his two - year service in 2007 for negligence during duty in the form of private concerts and tv show appearances			0
the entertainer who started it all , though , was a @entity3 - @entity177 singer in the 1990s called @entity178			0
the king of the k - pop scene at the time , @entity91 had voiced his eagerness to perform his military duty several times on television			1
but when the time actually came for him to enlist , the singer did an about - face and applied to become a @entity177 citizen			0
the public felt massively betrayed and in a stunning move , the @entity3 government deported @entity91 and banned him from the country for life			0
" since the controversy involving @entity91 , the issue of military service has been taken extremely seriously and people have stricter standards toward tv stars , " @entity3 pop columnist @entity192 told @entity3 newspaper @entity191			1
" people think there should be no special treatment or exemption for any group			1
