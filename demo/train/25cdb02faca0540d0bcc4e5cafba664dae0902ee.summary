-- to get a sense of how @entity2 is tying the @entity4 establishment in knots , look no further than sen. @entity6 , the powerful @entity4 from the site of the next major primary , @entity9			1
until november 2010 , @entity6 had a clear claim on being the most influential , populist - flavored fiscal conservative in the @entity12			0
then a wave of @entity15 freshmen helped bring a @entity4 majority to the @entity17 and a new breed of politician to the @entity12 -- one best exemplified by @entity21 's @entity20 , whose post-campaign memoir was titled @entity23			1
@entity6 , a strong social conservative , greeted it with both a hearty welcome ( " [ p ] ut on your boxing gloves			0
the fight begins today " ) and an attempt at line - drawing			0
" you ca n't be a fiscal conservative , " he claimed just after the election , " and not be a social conservative			0
" @entity6 was totally wrong about that -- polling data has indicated that a majority of @entity40 feel comfortable with the label of " fiscally conservative and socially liberal " -- but that 's not what 's interesting here			0
what 's interesting is that after pooh - poohing the existence of a species that closely resembles the politically homeless tribe known as libertarians , @entity6 , in the wake of rep. @entity2 's solid second - place showing so far in the @entity4 presidential primary season , is using the l - word as a compliment			1
" one of the things that 's hurt the so - called conservative alternative is saying negative things about @entity2 , " @entity6 told radio host @entity55 this week			1
" i 'd like to see a @entity4 that embraces a lot of the libertarian ideas			2
" this is a departure			0
in both 2000 and 2008 , the top two @entity4 delegate - winners ran on explicitly anti-libertarian platforms			1
as @entity67 wrote in his campaign memoir " @entity66 , " " i welcomed a greater , if still limited , role for government in national problems , anathema to the ' leave us alone ' libertarian philosophy that dominated @entity4 debates in the 1990s			2
so did @entity75 , i must add , who challenged libertarian orthodoxy with his appeal for a ' compassionate conservatism			2
' " the mix of compassionate conservatism , with its emphasis on domestic spending initiatives such as @entity83 and the @entity84 , and neo-conservatism , with its emphasis on interventionist foreign policy , produced results that were both predictable and predictably repellent to libertarians : a 60 % increase in federal nondefense spending under @entity75 , and a federal government that recognized no corner of the globe or hospital room as off - limits to @entity40 police power			1
it 's no wonder , then , that libertarians , like the rest of @entity40 , have been fleeing the @entity4 in droves			1
from 1972 to1988 , libertarians voted @entity4 for president 69 percent of the time ; since then the percentage has dropped to 46			1
meanwhile the country , and especially younger people , have been turning more culturally libertarian on issues like gay marriage and marijuana prohibition , at a time when the mainstream @entity4 keeps fighting those lost causes			2
@entity114 is on the glide path to the @entity4 nomination			1
but it is not escaping @entity4 notice that @entity114 's vote total in @entity119 was the same as it was in 2008 , and just 5 percentage points higher in @entity121 than four years previous			1
turnout among self - identified @entity4 decreased in both states , even after more than three years of @entity125 's misgovernance			1
@entity2 , on the other hand , more than doubled his vote total in @entity119 , and tripled it in @entity121 , largely by attracting nearly half of all independents and young voters			0
@entity2 has gotten twice as many votes as @entity132 so far			1
in the @entity121 , he received more votes than @entity134 , @entity135 , and @entity136 combined			0
and unlike @entity135 and @entity134 ( his two main competitors for the @entity139 slot at this point ) , @entity2 has a nationwide campaign , the ability to raise money at the drop of a hat , and the clear intention to compete all the way to the @entity148			0
he is the clear front - runner in the race for second place			0
what are poor republicans to do ? many of them hate @entity2 's ideas on foreign policy , roll their eyes at his talk about the @entity160 , deem him to be several fries short of a @entity162 , and -- correctly -- see his constitutional radicalism as a threat to both the philosophies behind compassionate conservatism and neo-conservatism , and to the practical gravy train of bipartisan big government			1
but he 's the only @entity4 game in town when it comes to drawing in the independents and young voters they need			2
@entity6 , for one , is making a partial accommodation , by saying nice things about @entity2 and refusing to endorse any candidate ( though his staff is another story )			0
" i do n't agree with @entity2 on foreign policy and his disengagement around the world , but we 're going to end up where he is because we do n't have any money , " @entity6 told @entity179			0
" so the @entity4 needs to become the big tent of @entity40 who really want freedom , prosperity , opportunity and that 's just synonymous with a more limited government			2
" but if the campaign comes down to a two - man race , you can expect some serious evictions from the @entity4 's shrinking tent			2

@entity208 : @entity210 *sidling* up to @entity2 after years of *shunning* libertarianism
he says @entity75 's policies drove libertarians from the @entity4
he says @entity114 may get @entity4 *nod* , but @entity2 votes are way up from 2008
@entity208 : like it or not , @entity4 may have to accommodate @entity2
