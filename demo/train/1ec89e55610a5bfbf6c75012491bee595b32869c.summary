-- she lives in @entity2 , and she honed her skills in @entity4 and @entity5 -- but world no. 1 @entity6 was most definitely made in @entity8			1
hurting from a slow start to her 2011 season , @entity6 wondered if professional tennis was really the career for her			1
a trip back home to @entity15 and a chat with her beloved grandmother soon put her back on track			2
" she never really talked to me about tennis or anything specific , she just was explaining to me about when she was growing up , " @entity6 told @entity0 's @entity19			1
" you just look at different perspective of things and i just realize , you know what , i 'm so lucky to have an opportunity to do something that i really love and i 'm here sitting and complaining about how hard my life is because i lost a tennis match when some people are really suffering with big troubles and they have a smile on their face			1
" since that conversation , @entity6 has won her first grand slam title at the @entity38 , thrashing the far more experienced @entity39 in january 's final to become the first player from @entity15 to win a major singles crown			1
the 22 - year - old has also claimed the no. 1 ranking , sparked by a 26 - match winning start to this season that only ended in @entity47 last month			1
while she wants to avoid coming across , as she puts it , as a " @entity48 , " @entity15 was hardly a hotbed of tennis talent when @entity6 was growing up , and her future was never mapped out			1
when she started working in a local tennis center , @entity6 's mother @entity53 needed a distraction for the young " @entity56 " so she could get on with her job			1
in desperation , @entity53 gave her daughter a racket and ball			0
" it was just fun for me to hit against the wall and one of the coaches saw me and asked me if i wanted to join the group and i was like , ' i do n't know , i 'm scared , ' but i picked it up right away , " @entity6 said			2
" we did n't even step on the court for the first year and a half			0
we played in a hall ... and there was 40 kids and we were so happy when we would hit one ball and wait five minutes for another one			0
" when she was n't part of the coaching group , @entity6 was hitting against a wall at the center			1
when she was n't at the center , she would play against her grandfather at home with a soft ball and badminton rackets , using the sofa and bookshelves to make the tennis court			2
@entity6 eventually outgrew her surroundings			2
she trained in @entity89 briefly before eventually completing her tennis education in @entity91 , @entity5			0
moving away from home at the age of 15 was difficult , but @entity6 said : " i saw my goal in the tunnel and i just wanted to do absolutely everything to reach it			2
" and she is n't done yet			0
with the top ranking and a major title in the bag , @entity6 has already moved on to new targets			1
with the @entity101 and @entity102 approaching , she has recruited two - time grand slam champion and former world no. 1 @entity104 to her coaching team			1
" i felt that she could help me in the way that my team probably never experienced before , " @entity6 said of @entity104 , who retired at the end of 2009			0
" she 's been through everything all ready , so those extra details or something could help , that 's what we always look for , something to be better			0
" the @entity116 also loom large			0
at the last games in @entity120 , @entity6 was " so hyper and so excited just to be there that i was n't worried about playing , i was just worried about being there and collecting pins			0
" she tried and failed to hunt down the autographs of record - breaking swimmer @entity123 and basketball 's golden boy @entity124 , but come august and the @entity119 , @entity6 will be one of the star attractions			2
her trips home to @entity15 , where she is an idol for thousands of children , have prepared her for the attention			0
" i do some kids clinics , and the last one i actually did in @entity8 , kids came from outside the cities , it was like almost 300 kids on one tennis court and they all start pushing each other because they all wanted to play and i was supposed to play for only one hour , " @entity6 said			2
" and i saw these kids , they were just like pushing each other and fighting and i said , ' guys please stop fighting because i 'll play with each one of you until everyone is done , i wo n't go home before that			0
' i was exhausted after that , but you have so much positive energy that it is just priceless			0
" so while @entity6 might live in glamorous @entity2 with neighbors like @entity152 and @entity153 , there is only one home			1
" my real home will always be @entity15 where i 'm from , and it can honestly never change			0
