-- just hours after the @entity3 consulate came under attack in @entity5 , resulting in the death of the @entity3 ambassador and three of his colleagues , @entity1 blocked access to an anti-islam video that sparked protests in @entity13 and @entity5			1
the video , which was made in @entity3 and crudely characterized the @entity15 , understandably offended many @entity16			0
it would appear that the decision by @entity19 -- which owns @entity1 -- was based not on an order by either government but on its own concerns			1
" we work hard to create a community everyone can enjoy and which also enables people to express different opinions , " @entity1 said in a statement			2
" this can be a challenge because what 's ok in one country can be offensive elsewhere			0
this video â € ” which is widely available on the web â € ” is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on @entity1			1
however , given the very difficult situation in @entity5 and @entity13 we have temporarily restricted access in both countries			1
our hearts are with the families of the people murdered in yesterday 's attack in @entity5			1
" although the video remains accessible for the rest of the world , users in @entity13 and @entity5 will , upon attempting to access it , encounter a message that it is not available in their jurisdiction			1
this is the same mechanism used when a copyright holder restricts content to a certain country			0
anti-islam filmmaker questioned although restricting the video in the two countries might seem tempting in the wake of the horrific violence that occurred in @entity5 , it is in the best interest of neither the company nor , arguably , the citizens of those countries for @entity19 to be the arbiter of acceptability			1
when it comes to copyrighted content , @entity1 is required to abide by the law , specifically the @entity69 , which allows a copyright holder to report content posted by other users as belonging to them ( it also allows for a rebuttal )			2
@entity1 has also taken down content under informal pressure from governments , such as in 2010 , when it removed clips reportedly linked to @entity79 after a speech in which @entity75 security minister @entity74 stated that such videos " incite cold - blooded murder and as such are contrary to the public good			1
" when it comes to that type of content or the content in the video in question , the fact of the matter is that there are few regulations by which @entity1 must abide			2
in the @entity3 , the content of the video would be deemed protected under the @entity99			0
as an @entity3 company , @entity1 itself also has a right to speech , which includes the right to make its own policies regarding what types of speech it deems appropriate to host			2
those policies have come under fire before			0
in 2007 , a @entity111 court ordered @entity1 to be blocked in the country after the company refused to take down videos deemed insulting to the country 's founder ; the ban was reversed two years later			1
@entity1 faced a similar ban in @entity119 in 2010 after refusing to take down cartoons depicting the @entity15			2
but while some governments think @entity1 is too lax , some of its users have felt it is too restrictive			0
@entity13 human rights activist @entity126 found his account deactivated in 2007 after posting violent content depicting police brutality in his country			0
eventually , his account was restored and @entity1 shifted its policies in response to his and other users ' complaints , allowing content containing violence to be posted under an exception for videos that are " educational " or " documentary " in nature			1
this policy later enabled activists in @entity13 , @entity143 , @entity144 and elsewhere to post documentation of regime violence			2
in the current case , @entity1 has stated that the video does not violate its terms of service			2
so if the video does not violate the company 's rules and @entity1 did n't receive an order from the two countries ' governments ( as far as we know ) , then the only explanation is that @entity1 is determining on its own what serves the best interest of @entity5 and @entity13			1
this is , indeed , a rare move from the company and may eventually backfire			0
news : protests calm , but tensions still high take another case from this year			0
when @entity119 blocked @entity167 after the company refused to take down offensive content , citizens were outraged , fearing it as a precursor to censorship during the election period			0
had @entity167 simply taken down the content , the story would have slipped by without notice ; instead , the outrage of citizens forced the government to reverse its decision in less than a day			0
@entity19 should take the lead from @entity167 , a smaller and younger company that , when faced with similar concerns , has stood strong , issuing a policy stating that content would be " withheld " in a certain country only in the face of a valid legal order and that the ban would be communicated transparently to all users			0
instead , by placing itself in the role of arbiter , @entity19 is now vulnerable to demands from a variety of parties and will have to explain why it sees censorship as the right solution in some cases but not in others			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			0

an anti-islam video sparked protests in @entity5 and @entity13 ; in @entity5 , violence *erupted*
@entity200 : @entity1 decided to block access to the video in the two countries
she says it is not in @entity19 's best interest to be arbiter of what 's acceptable
@entity216 : @entity19 will have to explain why it censors videos in some cases but not others
