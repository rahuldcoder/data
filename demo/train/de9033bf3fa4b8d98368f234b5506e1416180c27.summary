the next time @entity2 plays two -- something he enjoyed , feeling one baseball game a day was n't enough -- it will be in the diamond in the sky			1
the former @entity9 upstart turned @entity11 legend turned favorite son of @entity13 died friday of a heart attack in the @entity16 city , family attorney @entity7 said			1
it was a week shy of his 84th birthday			1
a public memorial will be scheduled , @entity7 said			2
@entity11 chairman @entity20 described banks as " one of the greatest players of all time			1
" " words can not express how important @entity2 will always be to the @entity11 , the city of @entity13 and @entity27 , " @entity20 said			1
" ... he was a pioneer in the major leagues			2
and more importantly , he was the warmest and most sincere person i 've ever known			2
" " approachable , ever optimistic and kindhearted , @entity2 is and always will be mr. @entity2			1
" farewell to ' mr. @entity2 ' @entity2 , an elegant ambassador and all - time great the thing is , @entity2 was n't just a great baseball player , but a great champion for his sport and adopted city			1
the @entity13 's mayor , @entity38 , called him " one of @entity13 's greatest ambassadors			1
" @entity38 said , " he loved this city as much as he loved -- and lived for -- the game of baseball			2
" and baseball loved him back -- not just for the player he was , but the man he was			2
this sentiment was evident on social media , with one man writing , " i 've heard a lot of @entity2 stories in my life , a lot			2
but not one of them showed him in a negative way			2
" one person tweeted that , like the recently departed @entity60 , @entity2 was " never too big for fans			2
" " mr. @entity2 will play 2 today , " wrote another man			1
" he 's with the @entity63 now and hopefully he 'll get a ring			2
" that message alluded to the fact that @entity70 , despite all his stellar play over his career , never earned a @entity72 ring			0
in fact , the last time the @entity11 won baseball 's ultimate prize was 1908			0
but you 'd never know it from @entity70 ' omnipresent smile			0
he became the @entity13 franchise 's first black player in 1953			1
that happened three years after the @entity84 native started his professional career in the @entity9 with the @entity86 , then spent two years in the @entity87			1
after the @entity86 sold his contract to the @entity11 , @entity70 jumped straight to the @entity89 -- hitting .314 in the 10 games he played in that first season			1
he became @entity13 's starting shortstop the next year , then had his real breakthrough in 1955 when he racked up 117 rbis			1
his 44 home runs that season were at the time the most ever for a shortstop			0
( he hit 47 homers three years later , still a @entity100 record for the position			0
) banks kept it up as his career rolled along			1
late umpire @entity105 once recalled that in 1957 , pitchers @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 knocked down banks with pitches , according to a story on the @entity11 ' website			1
" and each time he was knocked down , " @entity105 said , " @entity2 hit their next pitch out of the park			0
" the accomplishments piled up through @entity2 ' retirement after the 1971 season : 2,583 hits , 11 @entity100 all - star selections , two of the league 's @entity124 awards , and 512 home runs , including five seasons hitting more than 40 homers			1
and in 1977 , six years after his last at - bat , @entity2 was inducted into the @entity129			0
it 's no wonder , then , that he was voted the " @entity133 " in a 1969 @entity132 fan poll			0
after all , he was known both as " mr. cub " and " mr. @entity136			1
" @entity129 manager @entity137 , who was known for saying " nice guys finish last , " made an exception for banks			1
" @entity70 is one nice guy who finished first -- but he had the talent to go with it , " @entity137 said			0
and this from sportswriter @entity147 : " he rejoices merely in living , and baseball is a marvelous extra that makes his existence so much more pleasurable			0
" @entity7 , the family lawyer , said that @entity70 " would go right up to people and ask about their families and how they were doing rather than baseball			0
" " he wanted to know all about people 's lives			0
baseball was not the first thing he would talk about , " the attorney said			0
" he cared about people			0
" his work on and off the field led to his receiving the @entity159 , the nation 's highest civilian honor , in 2013			0
" to have this award passed on to me is certainly a great joy , " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity162 at the time			0
" it 's something i 'll never forget			0
" the slugger left an impression on president @entity168 and first lady @entity169 , too			0
in a @entity171 statement saturday , @entity168 noted how banks -- who made $ 7 a day coming up through the @entity9 -- never lost " his cheer , his optimism , and his love of the game			1
" " he was beloved by baseball fans everywhere , " @entity168 said , " including @entity169 , who , when she was a girl , used to sit with her dad and watch him play on tv			0
" people we 've lost in 2015			0

banks started in the @entity9 , played for @entity13 from 1953 to 1971
he was known as " mr. cub " and " @entity136 " for his positive , warm *demeanor*
