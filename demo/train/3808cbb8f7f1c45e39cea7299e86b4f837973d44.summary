-- it seems as if we are in a time of unprecedented struggle over the meaning of women 's bodies and sexuality			1
controversy is swirling about an @entity11 professor who breast - fed a baby in class ; topless photos of @entity15 have been released ; and a @entity17 cover showing a mother breast - feeding her toddler sparked even more tittering in may			0
it is not just the breast that is contested : @entity22 , the punk band , was sentenced to two years in a @entity24 prison after a staged performance in which they did high kicks that showed too much of their bodies			1
they tried , from prison , to explain " what pussy meant " and " what riot meant			0
" @entity36 representative @entity35 got into hot water -- and fought back -- for using the words ' my vagina ' in the @entity36 statehouse			0
@entity36 women supported her by standing in front of the statehouse with a giant " v " symbol and spelling out the words ' vagina ' in pink letters			2
young women in @entity49 protesting in the @entity50 were punished by imprisonment -- and vaginal exams by armed strangers for " virginity tests			1
" this is not so surprising when you understand the delicate brain - vagina connection that my new book documents -- female sexuality around the world is targeted because through traumatizing the vagina , you can intimidate women on multiple other levels			2
what is going on ? we are at an important crossroads in which it is becoming clearer to women around the world that , as one feminist artist put it , " your body is a battleground			2
" @entity75 enters stage left -- or is it right ? in a hypersexualized culture , in which porn is available 24 - 7 , it is not female nudity -- or discussion about vaginas or breasts or " pussy riots " -- that is scandalous			1
indeed , the female body has never been so commodified before , and female sexuality has never been so readily consumable in sanitized , corporatized formats such as pornography			0
rather , what is still scandalous to our culture is when women take ownership of their own bodies			1
staging a strip performance is not disruptive to social order in @entity100 , but three punk poets using their sexuality to make a satirical comment about @entity24 leader @entity104 is destabilizing and must be punished			0
legislating the most intimate aspects of women 's reproductive lives , all the way to imposing transvaginal probes on them -- as states are doing across the country -- is n't shocking or obscene , because it is about taking away sexual control from women of their own bodies			1
what is shocking and obscene is when a serious person -- a legislator -- dares to take back ownership of her own self , with the scandalous words " my vagina			1
" the issue is not the vagina , but who gets to say what becomes of it and who owns it			0
porn 24 - 7 does n't threaten social control			0
indeed , its addictive effects , in terms of new neuroscientific discoveries , actually turns out to be a kind of drug or sedative			0
this turns a potentially liberating sexual revolution into yet another marketable consumer product that hypnotizes people and is creating new health and sexual problems around libido , rather than setting them free			0
in the struggle over sex , these choices are where the struggle lies : who decides reproductive rights ; who decides when and how breasts might be exposed ; who decides who can say vagina and where ; who decides who is a slut ; and who must be punished with hard labor for asserting their right to define their own sexual and artistic identities			0
the sexual revolution came and went , and yet women are still not as truly sexually free as they deserve to be -- here or around the world			2
they are not yet , as these struggles show , fully free to define the meanings of their bodies and their desire , to assert their sexual wishes without punishment -- including punishment by the state			2
and they are not yet fully free to claim the right to sexual pleasure and autonomy without enduring public shaming			0
until that real freedom arrives , we can honor the pioneers such as @entity35 , @entity22 and the young women of @entity49 -- and keep up the fight to be free to name our bodies and ourselves			1
as gender and representation expert dr. @entity188 notes of the struggle over how one may speak about female sexuality : " for until we have a language and a platform for talking honestly about women 's bodies and sexual drives , we 're doomed into a cycle of objectification and silence			1
" the views in this article are solely those of @entity203 .			1

author @entity203 says recent controversies reveal *biased* views toward women 's bodies
the @entity22 trial and @entity50 protests showed women stripped of autonomy
women 's bodies are battlegrounds used to wage culture wars , @entity215 says
it 's scandalous when women take ownership of their own bodies , @entity215 contends
