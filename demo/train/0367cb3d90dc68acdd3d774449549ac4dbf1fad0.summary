@entity0 -- the world 's tropical forests are disappearing , and one reason is simple economics : people , companies and governments earn more by logging , mining or farming places such as the @entity13 jungle than by conserving them			1
global climate change treaty , scheduled for completion in december , is designed to protect tropical forests			1
efforts to halt rain forest destruction date back decades , but they so far have failed to tackle the issue on a scale commensurate with the challenge			0
now there may be a remedy , and the reason is climate change			1
increased awareness of the threat from global warming has prompted unprecedented international focus on how to combat it , as well as new appreciation for the vital role of tropical forests in the climate change equation			1
on tuesday , world leaders gather at the @entity37 for a special climate change summit , intended to build momentum for a new global climate change treaty being negotiated by almost 200 countries			1
the new treaty is scheduled to be completed in december in @entity43 , @entity44			2
if eventually enacted , the treaty will include a revolutionary but little - known provision intended to protect remaining tropical forests			1
known as @entity49 in developing countries , or @entity49 , the provision is based on the knowledge that destroying tropical forests contributes to global warming			1
rain forests absorb and store huge amounts of carbon dioxide , the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change			1
burning or clearing the forests returns that stored co2 to the atmosphere , where it can trap heat and gradually increase temperatures			2
every year , tropical forests equal to an area the size of @entity68 are destroyed , contributing about 20 percent of total annual greenhouse gas emissions -- more than all the world 's cars , trucks and airplanes combined			1
the idea of the proposed provision is to make the stored carbon dioxide in the forests a commodity that can be bought and sold on the global market			1
polluters in the developing world would be able to offset their emissions by buying credits for stored forest carbon dioxide			1
the money from those purchases would go to developing world governments , international organizations , local communities and others involved in forest protection programs			2
for the first time , tropical forests would be worth money for simply existing			1
that could create an economic incentive to protect tropical forests , which also have biological value as the planet 's richest storehouses of land species and spiritual worth as pristine natural landscapes			1
to longtime defenders of tropical forests , the proposal represents the final stage of a long and halting journey from the fringes of the environmental movement toward the mainstream of international policy			1
" done properly , this is our no. 1 hope , " said @entity113 , who founded the @entity114 in 1985 with the goal of halting tropical deforestation			0
" other strategies have been heroic but insufficient			0
" the system would let nations and industries that are the biggest greenhouse - gas emitters buy carbon credits in tropical forests in @entity126 and @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and other equatorial regions			1
at the same time , investors could speculate on the price of carbon dioxide through credit trading			1
private and public funds could invest in projects that protect forests to generate credits			0
final details of the plan remain uncertain , such as how forest carbon credits would be verified and how the money paid for them would be handled and distributed			0
for developing countries , the idea represents a potential new revenue source			0
president @entity148 of @entity149 , a leading proponent of the plan , has made trading carbon credits a central element of his low - carbon development strategy			0
the strategy " is more about development than about the environment and it will help us to accelerate infrastructural development and fill the budget gap , " @entity148 said in an august 29 speech			0
the @entity162 and partners have set up funds to help developing countries prepare for @entity49 and finance forest - protection initiatives			2
however , both funds are not fully capitalized , pending the successful conclusion of negotiations on the new global climate change treaty			1
" right now everybody is in a wait - and - see mode , " said @entity170 , the @entity162 's lead carbon finance specialist			0
" everybody seems interested , but the level of activity is still humble			0
" conservationists cite the environmental benefits of saving tropical forests , which provide essential resources and services -- such as fresh water , food , flood control and many others -- on which more than a billion people depend			2
now , they say , conserving forests also can contribute to sustainable development , benefiting both nature and people			0
yet several steps remain before the tropical - forest provision becomes reality on a large scale			2
first , the @entity37 - led negotiations must agree on a treaty to succeed the @entity197 -- the world 's first global climate change agreement , which expires in 2012			1
the @entity200 treaty created a global carbon market -- but only the carbon storage of newly planted or replanted forests is eligible for credits			2
@entity49 also would protect standing forests , to prevent the absorbed carbon dioxide stocks from being released back into the atmosphere			1
whether a new treaty will be completed in december is unclear			0
negotiators have yet to set consensus targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , and major disputes remain between industrialized powers such as the @entity214 and emerging and developing economies including @entity216 and @entity217			0
the draft under negotiation includes @entity49 , but negotiations continue on how broad the policy would be			2
advocates of a limited scope for @entity49 say areas with no history of deforestation should be excluded because protecting them wo n't reduce carbon dioxide emissions			1
in response , conservationists and developing nations warn against leaving out nations and regions -- including @entity148 's @entity149 , parts of @entity234 and @entity217 , @entity235 and others -- that still have much of their tropical forest intact			0
they argue that halting deforestation in only some countries would cause the loggers , palm oil developers and other drivers of forest destruction to move to previously untargeted areas			0
" if @entity49 mechanisms exclude any significant group of countries , @entity49 will fail , " @entity148 told @entity37 negotiators in december			2
critics , including some environmental groups , question how such a vast and complex system can be successfully implemented			0
a @entity254 report issued in march said including @entity49 credits in carbon markets would create a glut and drastically cut the price of carbon , resulting in industrial polluters buying cheap credits for offsets instead of reducing their emissions			2
the report also warned of reduced investments in renewable energy technologies due to the lack of an incentive from the cheaper carbon credits			0
others question whether @entity49 will be another scheme generated by industrialized nations to exploit resources of the developing world , and in particular , the indigenous forest peoples			2
@entity148 , the president of @entity149 , has said such critics should recognize the opportunity that a new climate change treaty could present			1
if it includes sufficiently robust commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , he argues , that would create a strong demand for carbon credits			0
the deforestation provision of a climate change treaty could help stem deforestation while providing " badly needed capital flows to some of the poorest countries in the world , " he said			1
yet even the idea 's most ardent supporters recognize that it could take years for a global - scale program to become effective			0
while local projects exist in rain forest countries such as @entity299 , it would take time and money to expand them			0
" if there is a deal in @entity43 and if there is a signaling by industrialized nations that , yes , they will make money available , then you will see developing countries scaling up their readiness , " said the @entity162 's @entity170			0
" they will see that this is now real and it 's the time to react			0

world leaders gather at the @entity37 for special climate change summit
treaty based on finding that destroying tropical forests adds to global warming
with proposed provision , stored carbon dioxide in forests could be bought and sold
@entity49 provision has critics
