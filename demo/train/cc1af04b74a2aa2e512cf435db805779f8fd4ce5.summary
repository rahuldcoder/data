former @entity1 mayor @entity0 faces prison with few of his former constituents shedding any tears for the man who led them through the biggest disaster in the city 's modern history			1
the two - term mayor quit @entity1 after leaving office in 2010 and now lives in the @entity13 suburbs			1
he swore off public life on his way out , and much of the city appeared ready to wash its hands of him after his wednesday conviction on federal corruption charges			2
" at one point or another , just about everybody voted for @entity0 , " said @entity22 , political editor of the @entity1 alternative weekly gambit			1
" and we all got fooled			2
" @entity0 has four months before his scheduled sentencing june 11 -- his 58th birthday			1
the most serious of the 20 counts on which he was convicted carry terms of up to 20 years , but most observers expect he 'll receive somewhere between 12 and 20 , @entity22 said			2
' too many halo - shiners ' @entity33 , a former @entity34 president during @entity0 's administration , said the ex-mayor now " has an opportunity for reflection " and to take responsibility for his actions			1
@entity33 speaks from a certain degree of experience , having served three years in federal prison in a 2007 bribery case			2
" everybody in political office should probably go to prison , just so you can come back to the people and humility , " said @entity33 , who now hosts a radio show in @entity1			1
" i 'm tired of seeing gloating political people and then you see they have weaknesses , also ... we got too many halo - shiners in the world			2
" @entity33 criticized the " bandwagon " he said was now cheering @entity0 's conviction , but added , " we all have to take responsibility			1
and when you 're a leader , especially an @entity66 leader , your integrity ca n't be 99 %			2
we have to be better			0
" federal prosecutors said @entity0 was at the center of a kickback scheme that brought him more than $ 200,000 in bribes , plus personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city			1
several of those businessmen had already pleaded guilty , and they testified against the ex-mayor during the two - week trial			0
@entity0 maintained his innocence after wednesday 's verdict , which made him @entity1 ' first mayor to be convicted of federal corruption charges			1
his defense was outgunned from the start , @entity22 said			0
" you 're up against federal prosecutors whose client literally prints money , " he said			0
" it takes a spirited defense and a substantive defense on federal criminal charges			0
you 've got to spend some money to counter that to create your own timeline , to create your own narrative			0
" but @entity0 did n't provide that support for his own defense , @entity22 said			1
so in court , " it all came down to @entity0 being on the stand , and the jurors said he came across as smug			1
" @entity0 's lawyer , @entity104 , did not return calls for comment thursday			1
he told reporters after the verdict , " we did the best we could do			0
" the onetime cable - television executive was elected in 2002 on a pledge of reform with the backing of city 's powerful business community			0
both gambit and the @entity117 endorsed @entity0 in his first run , only to oppose him later			1
' people are generally forgiving ' @entity0 drew national attention when @entity121 hit in 2005 , flooding more than three - fourths of @entity1 and killing more than 1,800 people across the region			1
supporters credited his sometimes - profane pleas for aid from @entity128 for embarrassing the president @entity130 administration into stepping up its response to the storm -- but his critics say he botched the city 's recovery			0
" his legacy is almost a non-legacy , " @entity22 said			0
" there was nothing that he actually got done			0
along with his conviction , his legacy will be one of poisoning the well for any , quote , business candidate for mayor for another 20 years			2
" @entity0 won a second term in 2006 despite a controversy over his pledge that @entity1 would remain a " chocolate " city , even as much of the city 's @entity66 population was displaced by storm damage			1
but his support in both black and white wards collapsed in his last four years , something @entity33 attributed as much to style and substance			0
" he was mostly aloof , kind of hands - off , " @entity33 said			0
@entity0 " was great at running a corporation			1
he was one of the smartest people i ever worked with			0
" but he lacked the personal touch a politician needs , @entity33 said			2
he urged @entity0 to use his prison time to help other inmates " who need his time and talent			1
" " that will be very rewarding , very fruitful , and he will have purpose , " @entity33 said			0
" and when he comes home , there 's always work to do on the streets , especially in urban areas			0
" " this is the greatest country in the world , and people are generally forgiving , " he added			0
" people will embrace you if you 're willing to do the work			0

former @entity1 mayor faces prison ; few sound sorry to see him go
" at one point ... just about everybody voted for @entity0 , and we all got fooled , " *columnist* says
but prison can be a good thing for a politician , convicted *ex-councilman* says
other inmates " need his time and talent , " he says
