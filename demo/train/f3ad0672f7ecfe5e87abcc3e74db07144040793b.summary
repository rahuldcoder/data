-- the gang rape and murder of a 23 - year - old student on a moving bus in @entity5 in december 2012 marked a sharp turning point for the debate on women 's rights in @entity9			1
the protests that exploded nationwide following the incident brought the issue forcefully to the political table in a way that revealed the power of the @entity9 masses , according to a prominent advocate for women 's rights			1
" as women in @entity9 , we grow up with constraints ; and live with a degree of discrimination and assault , " says @entity19 , a @entity20 lawyer , adding that privileged women , who have a significant amount of power , have to deal with it a lot less			1
" but when thousands of people came out onto the streets and walked in front of the @entity34 , the presidential palace , i think it became clear to me that none of us have to deal with this anymore -- that people around the country are standing with us and saying ' enough			0
' " that sentiment is shared by the majority of @entity9 taking part in the country 's general election this month , according to a recent public opinion poll			1
more than 90 % of @entity9 voters see the combating of violence against women as a priority , second only to corruption , the @entity53 / @entity52 survey released last week shows			1
according to the poll , 75 % of men and women participating in the largest democratic event in history also believe that the political promises made to advocate women 's rights have been inadequate so far			1
" the electoral process is a very important time to hold parties to account and to make it clear that politicians will lose their seats if they do n't truly represent the aspirations of the people , " says @entity19			2
" politicians need to respond to that			0
" so what are some of the main promises being made by the leading election contenders ? the three main parties cite similar goals , including enacting the @entity79 , which would allocate a third of seats in parliament and state legislatures for women , as well as enforcing fast - track courts -- the same process used to convict the accused men in the gang rape case			1
the ruling @entity89 , which has been in power for 49 years and is led by @entity91 , claims it will ensure at least 25 % of staff at all police stations are female			0
the main opposition , @entity94 ( @entity94 ) led by @entity95 , released its manifesto on the first day of the polls and says women 's security is its focus			1
the recently formed @entity101 ( @entity102 or " common man " party ) , born out of a desire to eliminate corruption , enjoyed an astonishing victory in @entity5 in the local assembly elections last year			2
during a news conference in @entity5 on thursday , the party 's leader and former activist @entity108 said women 's safety is the " biggest issue which has come to the forefront " and promised it would be high on the party 's agenda			1
but how convincing are these pledges ? " there have always been throwaway , ad hoc references to realizing women 's rights in manifestos in the past , " says @entity19			1
" in this election we see an increase in parties addressing those rights			2
they 're addressing them more frequently but the approach is still ad hoc			0
" the outcry after the gang rape in @entity5 did instigate some change , says @entity19			0
for instance , under the @entity136 , 2013 , stalking and voyeurism have become offenses and it is now possible to file a criminal complaint against a police officer			0
" but it 's not enough , " @entity19 says			2
for example , " marital rape is still not criminalized , it 's still explicitly legal			0
( the law ) says it 's rape unless the parties are married			2
" dissatisfied with the government 's efforts , ngos , women 's movements , journalists , economists , academics and lawyers are promoting their " @entity158 : " a six - point plan , first drafted last year , that details what needs to be done within the next five years to improve conditions for @entity9 's women and girls			1
the six points are : educate for equality ; make laws count ; put women in power ; appoint police for the people ; enact swift , certain justice ; and ensure a flourishing economy			0
@entity19 , co-founder of the plan , received early confirmation from @entity102 party leader @entity108 to commit to the charter			0
however , the @entity89 and the @entity94 are yet to agree			0
another motivation for the @entity158 was to spell out the process in which women 's issues should be tackled			1
co-contributor @entity180 , who is also secretary of the @entity181 ( all @entity9 @entity182 ) and national leader of the @entity184 ( @entity185 ) says political parties end up " moral policing women in the name of protecting them " by imposing dress codes or punishing couples for being intimate in public			1
although the mass protests following the @entity5 gang rape spurred change , @entity193 argues that the focus of the outcry needs to shift : " among the protesters there was still a large number that demanded the death penalty for rapists and little else -- and it is this sentiment that parties tend to play to , pushing patriarchal protectionism rather than women 's equality and rights			1
" @entity19 says a drawback in @entity9 is action : " the problem with @entity9 is not that we have bad laws ; i mean , the laws are n't perfect at all , but the problem is that they are n't implemented			2
" another major challenge for the @entity9 government is the country 's 1.2 billion population , with richly diverse religious and cultural practices			2
some , such as infanticide and dowry customs , are oppressive for women			0
so how can any plan accommodate the entire country ? referring to the @entity158 , @entity19 says : " there would be local discussions about this			0
it ca n't be the same plan for everyone ; @entity9 's too big a country			1
breaking down ( the plan ) for local practices and customs would be required			0
" @entity234 , group director at the @entity235 ( @entity235 ) , adds : " civil society needs to help the government			1
for certain areas , even the government does n't have the skills			0
" it 's not just about running out there and delivering a service or a product			0
you 're building perspectives , trying to change norms and attitudes , so it takes time to do that			0
" interactive : @entity9 elections : by the numbers			2
