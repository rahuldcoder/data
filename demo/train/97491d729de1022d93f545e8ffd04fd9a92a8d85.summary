ever since it appeared on the cover of animals , @entity1 's 1977 album , @entity2 in @entity3 has been famous around the world			1
it has appeared in everything from the @entity10 ' 1965 movie help ! to @entity13 's 2008 @entity12 movie @entity14 , and even dr who			1
but later this year , its distinctive chimneys -- the best - loved parts of one of @entity3 's best - loved buildings -- will be demolished			1
then they will be built back up again			2
" the chimneys are the most powerful part of the icon , " says @entity22 , director of @entity23 , the architects commissioned to develop the building			1
" take them away , and you do n't have an icon			2
the coal fumes has decayed the concrete , so they have to come down			2
but we 're going to painstakingly reconstruct them			2
" such will be the attention to detail that even the paint used will be precisely the same hue			2
and it will be sourced from the same manufacturer that provided the paint for the original chimneys , more than 80 years ago			1
the replacement of the chimneys is just the first stage in a development that will change @entity2 forever , arousing a passionate debate			1
a @entity49 the power station was built in the @entity51 as a functioning coal - fired electricity generator			1
but the building was so distinctive that it became recognized as a valuable part of the cityscape			1
the station stopped functioning in 1983 , and has since fallen into disrepair			1
it 's vast -- @entity59 , another of @entity3 's landmarks , could snugly fit into its old turbine rooms -- and over the years it has acquired the status of one of the architectural world 's best - known white elephants			1
now , funded by @entity69 developers , work is underway to transform the building into a massive complex of retail space , offices , and luxury " villas "			1
crowning the top of the development , at a height of more than 160 feet , there will be a roof garden			2
the first phase will be completed in 2016			0
@entity22 's plans for the chimneys are emblematic of his approach towards developing the site			1
" two of them are still going to be used as flues for the massive , modern energy center that we 're going to construct to power the place , " he says			1
" the third will remain hollow with a glass roof , and the fourth will house a cylindrical glass elevator that will pop out at the top at a viewing platform			0
" although the massive central cavity will be split into five floors and stuffed with stores and offices , @entity22 has included several areas where a " cut - out " will allow a glimpse of the distant ceiling			1
" there was a temptation to fill it right to the edges , " he says			0
" but when you enter the building , there will be an opening into a big space that will preserve the stunning sense of volume			0
" care will be taken to protect a flavor of the past on the inside , too			0
in an approach that @entity22 calls " light renovation " , graffiti and the stains of age will not be scrubbed clean or painted over			1
as part of the development , the building will be surrounded by large , modern office and retail blocks , with the flanks of the power station obscured from many angles			1
many feel that this is a shame , while others argue that this is the price for attracting investment to the site			0
questions have been raised , however , over the price of the new apartments			0
at £ 2,000 per square foot , they will cost the same as those in the " golden postcodes " of @entity147 and @entity148 and parts of @entity150			0
for an icon that represents all of @entity3 , that seems a little exclusive			0
" i am aware of that , " he says			0
" the control room , for instance , is a wonderful example of art deco extravagance			0
it would be easy to turn it into a restaurant , but it would be a very expensive restaurant			0
instead it will be a space for public events , like fashion shows			0
" controversial restoration the development of the @entity2 has re-opened the highly - charged debate about whether -- and how -- iconic buildings should be preserved , modified or replaced , and who they " belong " to			1
in this age of technology , fast - paced social change and innovation , many see it as the most important architectural dilemma of our times			0
sir @entity182 , one of @entity184 's foremost architects hose credits include everything from @entity187 to the @entity189 headquarters on the banks of the @entity191 , is sharply critical of @entity22 's design			1
" i think it 's rather sad , " he told @entity193			2
" there 's quite a fashion for keeping the outside appearance of a building at the expense of the interior			2
when you 're inside @entity2 , you wo n't know it because the corridors , shops and apartments will be the same as everywhere else			1
" " my feeling is that it 's the sheer opportunity to get a couple of million square feet in there			2
under the pretext of keeping the shell of the building , you 're getting planning consent for a lot of space			0
in @entity3 , you can charge £ 2,000 per square foot			0
that 's quite a lot of money , and i can see the temptation			2
but there are other ways that could work just as well			0
" @entity182 's own design for the site , which was not taken forward because of fears over planning permission , would have turned the power station into an " iconic ruin " standing over a massive public space			1
it would have been made financially viable by the construction of high - value apartments around the power station			1
" i said that what we should do is remove the walls but retain the colonnade , and make the whole interior a park , " he said			0
" it would be like a giant abbey ruins , or a @entity243 temple with just the columns and no roof			0
the key features , like the control rooms , would be kept exactly in the place they occurred on legs			0
" this , he argued , would enable people to " go in and feel the space "			0
" you would understand far more what it used to be			0
it would be a sort of monument , " he said			0
" it would be far better than going to a shopping center , or a luxury home , and saying , ' do you realize this used to be @entity2 ? ' " such controversy is only to be expected when the future of such an important building as this is at stake			1
and the more iconic a building , the more forensic critics of its redevelopment will be			2
eye - popping vertical : photos give @entity278 skyscrapers a radical new look the enduring allure of steam trains : a nostalgic journey back in time a rare snoop inside homes of some of the world 's greatest living architects			2

as part of the @entity2 renovation , the chimneys will be knocked down then rebuilt
@entity69 developers are funding the station 's transformation into offices and luxury villas
the power station has ignited debate on how iconic buildings should be maintained
