one night in early october 2014 i woke up at 2 a.m. and began watching @entity2 on @entity3			1
the show was about the future of cancer treatment through immunotherapy -- a topic close to my heart			1
in 2012 , i was diagnosed with stage 3c ovarian cancer , at age 52			1
as i watched dr. @entity14 interview doctors , researchers and two patients at @entity18 / @entity17 , i decided , then and there , that i wanted to be in a research trial			1
some days in our lives are memorable			2
we all prefer the good days , marriages , births , and graduations			0
june 8 , 2012 was not one of those days for me			1
that was the day i was diagnosed			1
i went immediately from being a lawyer , mother , and wife -- taking care of everyone -- to being a professional patient			0
before diagnosis , i did not know approximately 21,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer annually in the @entity37 , and 14,500 women die from this disease			1
that 's 40 per day and 1200 per month			1
i am positive for the @entity42 genetic mutation , inherited via my father who carried the mutation in his genes			0
women like me , with this mutation , have a 50 % chance of getting ovarian cancer in their lifetime			1
while women with breast cancer have a 90 % five - year survival rate , women with ovarian cancer have a 45 % five - year survival rate			1
as there is no test to find it at an early stage when it is most treatable , it 's most often found in the late stage ( stage 3 or 4 ) when it is difficult to treat and life expectancy is at its lowest -- 2.5 years on average , but i am now exceeding that average			1
i had seen my gynecologist eight weeks before diagnosis and had a pap smear ( which does not test for ovarian cancer ) and a pelvic exam , which were clear			1
over the next few weeks i began to experience bloating , decreased appetite , back pain , and frequent urination			0
i had all the classic symptoms but was not seeing what they were -- signs of ovarian cancer			1
i had n't paid attention because i was busy running my practice and my home			0
suddenly , june 6 , i could not urinate properly			0
my gp examined me and scheduled a @entity80 scan the following day			0
then on june 8 came the tornado named cancer			1
after nine days , collapsed veins from @entity85 , and losing over 20 pounds of ascities -- a fluid produced by the cancer -- i was released from the hospital and allowed a few weeks to heal			1
the pathology report showed i had low - grade epithelial cancer which is notoriously difficult to treat			2
i have a less than 35 % chance of living through the next five years			0
unfortunately , there has been no breakthrough drug for ovarian cancer treatment in more than 20 years			1
my treatment began with chemotherapy -- three weeks on , one week off			2
the drugs @entity98 and @entity99 were infused into my body			0
i spent the weeks off trying to clear my " chemo brain " and raise my blood levels			0
i went through six of these cycles spanning july to december 2012			2
the treatment appeared to be effective , but by may 2013 , i was back on chemo , ( this time with @entity106 and @entity107 )			0
after 16 cycles , in august 2014 , this too had stopped working			0
i was faced with the difficult decision of whether to try treatment that would further deplete me , or enter a clinical trial			1
i knew i needed a new approach to my treatment and then the night came when i saw the show			0
the next day i called @entity116 and learned a new ovarian cancer trial was about to start for which i might be eligible			1
they were seeking five patients and my timing appeared to be perfect			0
within four weeks i had cleared all the testing and began the trial			2
my form of cancer made me eligible as it releases certain proteins which attract the experimental drug , enabling it to attack in a targeted manner			2
i describe this as tactical airstrike treatment as opposed to most treatments , which carpet bomb and kill healthy cells in our bodies as well as cancer cells			2
my treatments are weekly via iv for one hour			0
since it is a trial , i also regularly undergo comprehensive diagnostic tests and the chemo nurses check my vital signs to ensure that this drug is helping , rather than harming , me			2
after six treatments , the cancer is stable and has not grown			2
thus , i am allowed to continue treatment for another six weeks and undergo another evaluation			0
i know i am one of the fortunate women with a lot of support			0
my husband has been with me every step , every day , and participates in my care , and the fabulous doctors and nurses have cared for me from the beginning to now			0
as i say regularly , i am not in the mood to die yet			0
so , one day at a time i will keep trying until we find something that will work , even temporarily			0
perhaps this trial will keep me alive long enough for science to catch up and help find a cure for this , and other cancers			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169			1

@entity169 was diagnosed with stage 3c ovarian cancer in 2012
despite *numerous* round of chemotherapy her cancer did not *subside*
after watching @entity0 's @entity2 , @entity169 enrolled in a clinical trial at @entity116
