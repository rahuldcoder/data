-- life tends to be simpler , slower , safer in @entity2 than in many @entity4 cities			1
drivers take their time on the winding mountain roads			0
streets are largely empty at night , with people routinely turning in by 9 p.m. and violence found in tribal areas near the @entity13 border , in the disputed territory of @entity15 , and denser cities including @entity17 and @entity18 typically has no place in @entity2			1
until monday morning , that is			2
that 's when @entity2 went from a sleepy northern @entity4 city 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) north of the @entity4 capital of @entity18 to the site of a bloody and historic firefight			1
there , in a city heavily populated with @entity4 army personnel , a handful of @entity28 special forces executed a daring 40 - minute raid in which they killed @entity33 , the world 's most well - known terrorist leader			1
the electricity was out in @entity2 early monday , recalled city resident @entity36			1
this was not an especially unusual occurrence , he said			0
nor was the buzz of a helicopter overhead , especially given the abundance of such flights since massive floods ravaged the region			2
but the freelance software engineer , who also owns a coffee shop in town , noticed the helicopter did n't land immediately , as they usually do			0
instead it hovered , prompting him to write on his @entity53 feed : " @entity54 - before i take out my giant swatter :-/			0
" shortly thereafter , @entity36 -- who had come to the typically restive city of @entity2 in part for peace and security from @entity17 -- heard a loud explosion			1
" i thought to myself , i had moved all the way to @entity2 from @entity17 only to avoid bomb blasts and violence , and now this had even followed me even here , " @entity36 told @entity0			1
@entity66 , a 24 - year - old student at the @entity67 , heard three explosions in all			0
after the first one at 1:08 a.m. , he texted a friend to ask him what happened			0
the last -- coming just three minutes later -- was the biggest			0
" my house , which is three kilometers ( two miles ) away ( from the bid @entity72 ) , shook and the glass in the windows rattled , " @entity66 recalled			2
helicopters were seen , too , heading out			2
@entity66 said that one flew over his house , while @entity79 , a doctor in the city , saw one final chopper flying off very low			2
" initially , i was too afraid to go out , " @entity79 said			0
" but within just a few minutes , by 1:15 a.m. , the power was back on			0
" i did not think much of it , other than these were odd occurrences , " recalled @entity36			2
" i shut my laptop and walked away			0
" as people went to sleep , @entity4 tv stations reported it was all part of a @entity4 military exercise			1
it was not until after dawn that the facts became evident : one of the world 's most wanted fugitives , @entity33 , had been living in their midst and was now dead , killed by @entity28 forces			1
" it came as a big surprise , " said @entity79 , the 28 - year - old doctor			0
" by the next day , the blockage of streets around the housing compound where @entity33 lived was the most visible reminder of the raid			1
residents talked over tea about the fact the mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , and other attacks , just a few hours earlier , had lived in their midst -- and that a foreign military , too , had descended on their city			1
@entity66 said that some in @entity2 are angry at the @entity4 government , not just for letting other nation 's military strike in their hometown but also for the fact its own military , despite having a major base down the street , never acted on its own			1
still , for the talk , the college student said that it did n't take the city long to return to normal			2
" the truth is , we 're all going about our lives as though nothing happened , " said @entity66			0
" i went to college today ( with ) my friends here , and traffic is at is always is			0

residents say @entity2 is simpler and safer than most @entity4 cities
they recalled helicopters flying overhead early monday and several blasts
many hours later , news came out @entity33 had lived and was killed there
there is talk about the historic *development* , but life returns to normal
