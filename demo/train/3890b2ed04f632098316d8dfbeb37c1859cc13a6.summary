the serial revelations by @entity1 , the former @entity3 contractor who stole and leaked classified government information , have ignited a variety of disputes in the @entity8 and around the world			1
is the collection of metadata , detailed records of phone calls and other communications , as benign or as malignant as it has been portrayed ? what are the proper limits in conducting electronic surveillance of geopolitical allies or of ordinary citizens ? how much government espionage activity must be publicly available to really give meaning to the concept of " consent of the governed " ? is it appropriate to secretly compel private enterprise to assist in intelligence collection ? tough questions all , but they give rise to another even more important one			1
will the internet as we know it survive the barrage of headlines and accusations ? as commonplace as the net has become , it 's hard for even older folks to remember the world before we all became wired			0
and younger generations do n't even try to picture that benighted universe			0
but the net is recent , the product of visionaries like @entity43 and his colleagues at @entity45 in the early 1970s ; they developed the @entity30 's original protocols for the @entity48 so department labs and a few universities could pass among themselves large volumes of data quickly and easily			2
the @entity53 that would take off from that @entity48 start would be a multistakeholder enterprise : nongovernmental , collaborative and ( certainly at its origin ) largely @entity8			1
the @entity8 ( i.e. , the various internet governance structures , like @entity58 , the @entity58 , anchored in the @entity8 and operating under a contract with the @entity8 government ) proved good stewards , nurturing an enterprise that was ubiquitous , free , unitary , egalitarian and democratic			1
information has never flowed as freely or in such volume as it does today , enabling global commerce and global expression on an unprecedented scale			0
and in that , the @entity53 was consistent with the traditional @entity8 emphasis on free enterprise and free speech , values not universally shared in today 's world			1
as @entity8 fret about the theft of personal information and intellectual property and the threat of cyberattack ( dark forces leveraging the @entity53 's ubiquity and connectivity for dark purposes ) , others are attacking the very essence of the network			1
they are less concerned about theft and more concerned that their citizens can access information -- any information -- as well as make their voices heard globally			0
in december 2012 , @entity92 and @entity93 pushed very hard at a meeting in @entity95 of the @entity96 to wrest " control " of the internet from its traditional governance structures ( increasingly international but still with a strong @entity8 flavor ) and hand it to this @entity101 - sponsored body			1
their apparent purpose was to make it easier for them to impose controls on their digital " territory " and on their citizens , to transfer to cyberdomain authorities control they had long exercised in physical space			2
@entity114 ceo @entity113 and his co-author @entity115 anticipated this in their thought provoking work , " @entity120 , " in which they warned of the balkanization of the @entity53 , with countries establishing " sovereignty " over their digital domains and demanding the digital equivalents of visas and passports before allowing entry to their national domains , and , in the case of their own citizens , exit			2
indeed , they proved prescient as countries like @entity138 and @entity139 are already establishing digital " residency requirements , " demanding that prospective cloud service providers retain data only on servers in their sovereign space , a requirement that flies in the face of the very nature and inherent advantages of a global web			2
at the 2012 @entity95 conference , the @entity92 and the @entity93 got strong support from places like @entity153 and the @entity155 world , but garnered support from 89 countries , falling short of the two thirds required			0
it actually does n't matter how accurate or inaccurate , precise or overdrawn , the headlines are as they allege that the @entity8 and @entity161 are taking unconstrained advantage of the web for espionage			0
( i , for one , doubt that @entity3 and @entity161 's @entity166 , are actually that interested in the personal data of the 1.5 billion people who have downloaded @entity169 , to cite but one recent accusation			0
) but the @entity92 , the @entity93 , the @entity153 and others will use these headlines to buttress their case and to undercut @entity174 arguments based on free expression and free access to information			1
the next meeting of the @entity179 , a @entity101 agency , is in @entity180 this october and prospects are not good for holding the line on the multistakeholder model of @entity30 governance , as governments demand more direct control			0
the current phrase to describe that development is " splinternet " and if that occurs we will be faced with multiple ironies			0
the @entity8 , the creator of the web as we know it , will have hastened its end through its espionage sins , real or imagined			1
and @entity1 , who by all accounts is a near constant habitu√© of that idyllic universe , will have lit the fuse of its destruction .			0

@entity204 : @entity1 revelations raised questions about data collection , surveillance
he says some nations leveraging this to change @entity53 's governance , control citizens
he says this would let them *subvert* " free expression " on the @entity53 , counter to its nature
@entity204 : if " splinternet " happens , @entity8 will have helped cause it with " sins " real , imagined
