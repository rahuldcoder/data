-- i keep thinking of those television ads from the @entity4 tourism industry urging @entity5 to " come visit @entity6			1
" visiting is n't difficult			2
for some @entity5 , it 's leaving that 's the problem			1
for years , @entity5 officials have urged their @entity4 counterparts to get tough on drug traffickers			1
the @entity5 even provided $ 1.4 billion through the @entity13 to help our friends south of the border accomplish that goal			1
yet , the drama that unfolded in the state of @entity20 for the last week ca n't be what @entity5 officials had in mind			1
the idea was to help @entity6 's police and military pursue violent criminals -- the sort who terrorize people by scattering human heads like party favors on the dance floors of nightclubs -- not to prey on @entity5 held for ransom by crooked cops looking for their next payday			1
and that seems to be what happened to @entity39 , a 42 - year - old @entity5 citizen who spent the last several days sitting in a women 's prison in @entity41 , @entity6 , on what looks like bogus drug charges			1
@entity44 , a mormon with seven children and two grandchildren , was released late thursday when a judge concluded what was already evident to most of us -- that the @entity4 authorities had no evidence to hold her			2
the family 's nightmare is over			1
it began last week when the @entity4 - born @entity39 and her husband , @entity57 , boarded a bus to head back to the @entity5 after attending her aunt 's funeral in @entity6			1
that was their first mistake			0
those of us who visit @entity6 know you never get on a bus			1
it makes you easy pickings for bandits and bad cops , and sometimes you ca n't tell the difference			2
bandits might take your money , and let you go on your way			0
bad cops take your liberty , and hold it until someone back home sends enough money to let you go on your way			1
either way , it 's not personal			0
it 's just a business transaction			0
but it 's a cruel and ugly business			0
anyway , back to the bus			0
it came up to a military checkpoint -- which might as well be a toll booth -- and everyone was taken off the bus as soldiers boarded it			0
" i was at the checkpoint , asked to get off bus , " @entity39 told @entity0 from prison			1
" they were checking for drugs and i do n't know what else			1
they say they found something under the seat but i never saw anything			0
they did n't show me anything			2
it was amazing all what they did			0
" the soldiers claim that they found a package containing 12.5 pounds ( 5.7 kilograms ) of what appeared to be marijuana under @entity39 's seat			1
and so they placed her under arrest , and handed the case over to the @entity4 attorney general 's office for prosecution			0
maybe drugs were there before she ever sat down			2
or maybe the soldiers put the drugs there			2
or maybe there were no drugs at all			2
no one knows , because , conveniently , the only people on the bus were the soldiers			2
@entity44 has said that he and his wife checked their bags , and boarded with no luggage			0
he says that when his wife was taken into custody , one of the soldiers told him matter - of - factly that it would cost him $ 5,000 to get her released			0
later , according to family members , he was quoted the same price by civilian authorities -- $ 5,000 -- for her release , whether she was found guilty or not			2
that 's how it works			0
think of it as a processing fee			0
in @entity6 , stories like this one -- which are all about money , and corruption , and how predatory some hungry people can be when they catch a glimpse of a piece of bread -- are as common as pinatas and margaritas			1
but that 's not supposed to be the case anymore			0
i was in @entity155 in november on a mission sponsored by the @entity157			0
we met with top officials , including president @entity160 , and the message could not have been clearer			0
" with a booming economy , less crime in metropolitan areas , and the reins of power now back in the hands of the @entity164 , the country is open for business			0
" sorry folks , it seems there are still unseemly remnants of the old @entity6 , and they are threatening to undermine the makeover			1
the @entity177 probably are n't thinking about the relationship between the @entity5 and @entity6 at the moment			1
they 're just glad to have a wife and mother home with her family			1
this ugly chapter , in their lives and in the @entity5 - @entity6 relationship , is finally closed			1
incidentally , @entity6 is still waiting on the last few hundred million dollars in drug fighting funds promised under the @entity13			1
@entity189 should send the rest of the money			0
that should go to the @entity44 family			0
think of it as a processing fee			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity198 : @entity5 mother *jailed* in @entity6 on what looks like bogus drug charges
he says funds to fight drugs in @entity6 were n't meant to hold *innocent* people in jail
@entity6 is supposed to be beyond this kind of police and court corruption , he says
he says @entity39 , mother of 7 , is home with her family , nightmare over
