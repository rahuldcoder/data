-- last year was the safest in aviation history for passengers flying on @entity5 - built jets , an international aviation trade group said wednesday			2
the 2010 global accident rate was 0.61 per million flights , a rate equating to one accident for every 1.6 million flights , according to the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
that is just below the previous historic low rate of 0.65 rate in 2006 , and a " significant improvement " over the rate of 0.71 recorded in 2009			1
there were 17 plane accidents -- or hull losses , in the lingo of the business -- involving @entity5 - built jet aircraft in 2010 , compared to 19 the previous year			1
a hull loss is an accident in which a plane is destroyed or damaged beyond repair			0
there were 786 fatalities in passenger aircraft compared to 685 in 2009 , @entity11 said			0
as in the past , there were significant regional differences in the accident rates , with @entity33 having relatively low rates and @entity35 having the worst rate			1
while @entity35 's hull loss rate was 7.41 -- four @entity5 - built planes crashed in @entity35 -- it was lower than the 2009 rate of 9.94			1
@entity11 director general @entity41 said @entity35 systems must improve			1
" flying must be equally safe in all parts of the world , " @entity41 said			0
" an accident rate in @entity35 that is over 12 times the global average is not acceptable			1
" he said @entity35 carriers should make use of an @entity11 audit system to improve safety			2
runway excursions -- instances when a plane leaves the runway during take - offs or landings -- accounted for 21 percent of the worldwide accidents , @entity11 said , saying the number has dropped because of attention to the problem			2
some of the accidents occur when planes land on wet runways ; others when the aircraft approaches too fast , too high or touches down beyond the desired spot on the runway			2
@entity11 said it is working with the industry and regulators to address the issue			0
@entity11 said 2010 had the following results : 2.4 billion people flew safely on 36.8 million flights			0
94 accidents for all types of aircraft -- @entity78 and @entity5 built -- compared to 90 in 2009			0
23 fatal accidents for all passenger aircraft types , compared to 18 in 2009			0
@entity11 represents some 230 airlines comprising 93 percent of scheduled international air traffic .			0

2010 saw 17 accidents on such airplanes
@entity35 has the worst rate
