the 29 - year - old revealed last year -- on the same day former 100 - meter world - record holder @entity20 of @entity2 and former world champion @entity22 of the @entity23 said they had tested positive for banned substances -- that she would never " intentionally take an illegal substance of any form " but @entity2 's anti-doping disciplinary panel tuesday claimed she was " negligent , " the @entity19 newspaper reported			1
the ban is backdated to last june , which means @entity1 would be able to return to competition this december			0
" the panel has given no written explanation as to how or why they came to this decision , " @entity1 's agent , @entity32 , said in a statement sent to @entity0			1
" we feel that this ruling is incredibly unjust and we will be appealing to the @entity4 ( for ) sport immediately			2
