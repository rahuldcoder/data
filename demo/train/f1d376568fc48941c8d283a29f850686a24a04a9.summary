-- @entity1 was eerily portentous when he made his famous statement : " i feel life is measured in achievement not in years alone			2
" his eponymous @entity8 @entity7 team celebrates its 50th anniversary monday , some 43 years after the @entity5 was killed on the racetrack			1
@entity8 was only 32 years old when he died testing a car for the can - am championship but in his short life he broke new ground in motorsport as a popular racer , team manager and forward - thinking engineer			1
his legacy races on today as the @entity8 race team -- winners of a record 182 grands prix and eight team titles in motorsport 's elite @entity7 series			1
@entity8 has also powered a stellar cast of seven world champions including @entity31 hero @entity30 , @entity33 four - time winner @entity32 and the 2008 world champion @entity34			2
but for @entity8 , the man , it all began at a kitchen table growing up in @entity37			2
" motor racing was in my blood , " @entity1 explained in his autobiography published posthumously on his website			0
" how @entity42 put up with @entity43 and me with her kitchen table covered in bits and piece of the engine i will never know			0
" as a child @entity1 honed his racing instincts by holding wheelchair races in the grounds of the hospital where he was recovering from a hip disease which left him with a lifelong limp			0
but once fully recovered he had made the transition to cars by the age of 14			0
in 1958 he left for @entity57 to make his f1 debut at the @entity60 @entity59 in a @entity61			0
during the following season , @entity8 became the youngest driver to win an @entity7 race at the @entity64 @entity59 -- a record now held by @entity67 's record - breaking world champion @entity66			1
@entity1 , who had more on his mind than racing , had also studied engineering in @entity57 and in 1963 he established the @entity8 team , initially to build cars to compete in @entity72 and @entity73			1
his eponymous @entity8 marque made its @entity7 debut on the streets of @entity77 in 1966 and two years later @entity8 took his orange racer to its first victory at the @entity80			1
name on the nose the speed of @entity8 's first victory is amazing given that the teams who joined @entity7 in 2010 are still to win their first point			1
" i did n't know [ i had won ] ! " @entity1 said at the time			2
" it 's about the nicest thing i 've ever been told			0
" i had won a @entity59 in a car with my name on the nose			0
" @entity8 would go on to win 181 more races in @entity7 -- more than any other team in the history of the sport			1
the current staff at the team headquarters in @entity100 , @entity57 celebrated that winning mentality and fired up some of the team 's historic cars as part of the anniversary celebrations monday			0
" @entity8 started as the dream of one man , and it 's since grown to encompass the hopes and dreams of more than 2000 men and women , who work as tirelessly as @entity1 himself once did , " said @entity107 chairman @entity106			1
" [ they ] ensure that everything we do reflects well when compared with everything we 've ever achieved			0
" our 50th anniversary provides an opportunity for every single @entity8 employee to realize that he or she is an utterly crucial part of an organization with a history and a culture that really mean something			0
" call it @entity8 's @entity129 ... call it @entity8 's undiminished hunger to win in everything we do			0
" the team 's slogan is : " we exist to win , " and it is a mantra often repeated by current @entity8 team principal @entity136 , even when the team has struggled to compete with its rivals @entity67 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
@entity1 , who also plan to celebrate their anniversary at the upcoming @entity143 @entity59 , do not have a car capable of winning races in 2013			2
appetite for winning drivers @entity147 and @entity149 have also not been on the podium , representing a backwards step from the 2012 season when the team ended the season with the fastest car			0
@entity147 , however , remains confident the @entity8 powerhouse will turn around their @entity7 fortunes , especially with a significant rule change on the horizon in 2014			1
" i firmly believe this team will be great again , " said @entity147 , who has won eight races since joining @entity8 in 2010			1
" this is an organization you can never discount -- their appetite for winning is unlike anything i 've ever seen and , rest assured , we will be back at the front soon			0
" while the team 's founder may have been driven by his racing ambitions the company now does not rely on success in @entity7 alone			2
@entity106 , who merged his own race team with @entity8 in 1981 , has been an influential driving force behind the modern @entity8 brand			1
the company , which also has @entity181 and @entity180 shareholders , not only competes in @entity7 but produces luxury sports cars while @entity183 has seen @entity7 technology cross over in medicine and the military			2
the team even create its own cartoons			0
@entity8 may be measuring 50 years since the fresh - faced @entity1 decided to build his own cars and go racing -- but the team have followed their founder 's mantra by marking their achievements in more than just numbers .			1

@entity1 founded his eponymous race team in 1963
the @entity200 racer won his first @entity7 race with a @entity8 in 1968
the @entity8 team has now won a record 182 grands prix
the @entity8 creative brand also produces sports car , high - tech *equipment* and cartoons
