-- some 20,000 text messages , 25 photographs including nudes , and alleged secret meetings have prompted prosecutors to rescind a plea offer and request that bond be revoked for @entity9 teen @entity8 , charged with felonies in a sexual relationship with a 14 - year - old girl , according to court papers			1
@entity8 , who turned 19 last wednesday , was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the parents of a then - 14 - old schoolmate went to authorities in @entity20 saying @entity8 had a sexual relationship with their daughter			1
after the case gained nationwide publicity , @entity8 was offered a plea deal in which she would not face jail time , nor would she have to wear an ankle bracelet or have to register as a sex offender			0
but @entity9 assistant state attorney @entity30 told @entity0 monday that since learning about @entity8 's alleged contact with the victim in this case , the state has taken the deal off the table			2
texts , photos and meetings would violate a no - contact court order issued in february as a condition of @entity8 's being out of jail while awaiting trial			1
prosecutors now say in court papers that also in february , @entity8 gave the girl an @entity46			2
the device was used to receive and send about 20,000 text messages between the two , according to the court papers			0
@entity8 also is accused of sending photographs and videos to the girl , with the court papers saying " these photographs are explicit and depict the defendant nude ... " prosecutors included examples of texts they say @entity8 sent to the girl , including : " ( @entity61 ) o matter what if they find out we talked i 'm going to jail until trial starts			1
" the texts are proof that @entity8 was " consciously and intentionally violating the court 's order , " prosecutors said in the papers			1
prosecutors also say that the younger girl told a detective that @entity8 would drive her to " a remote location where they would have intimate physical contact			1
" the court papers claim that the most recent meeting took place two weeks ago			0
the @entity8 family refused to comment and their attorney has not responded to @entity0 's request for an interview			0
the case gained national attention when @entity8 's family went public on @entity87 after she was charged , detailing their daughter 's case and essentially accusing the victim 's family of going after their daughter because she is gay			0
the victim 's family said that is n't true and that they were only trying to protect their teenage daughter			0
a judge will decide tuesday whether @entity8 's bond should be revoked and if that happens , she could be jailed .			2
