@entity13 , a lawyer for the parents of 17 - year - old @entity15 , said he expected an inquest would find @entity15 " was the victim of foul play , " not the accident that authorities in his south @entity1 hometown have ruled			1
" how could you , in the midst of all these questions , deny this family an opportunity to have an investigation into the cause and manner of their child 's death ? " @entity13 asked			1
" this is one way in which that investigation could be reopened			0

the private pathologist who conducted that autopsy in june found that @entity15 had a blow to the right side of his neck " consistent with inflicted injury			1
