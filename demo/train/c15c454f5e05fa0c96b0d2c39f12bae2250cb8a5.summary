president @entity0 and @entity1 are steering clear of competitive @entity3 districts but @entity4 are still making sure their presence is felt			1
the president and @entity7 are star players in television commercials the @entity4 is pumping into these districts in the final stretch before the midterm elections			1
it 's not surprising that the @entity4 is tying the president , whose approval ratings are at records lows , to vulnerable @entity3 and @entity17 @entity16			2
but @entity1 's image pops up even more than the president 's in the latest round of @entity4 campaign ads targeting @entity16 incumbents and challengers			1
one senior @entity3 @entity4 strategist tells @entity25 that while @entity0 is unpopular , their internal polls show that @entity1 remains even more " toxic			1
" @entity0 on the airwaves on tuesday , the @entity28 unveiled a new television commercial attacking @entity31 @entity16 rep. @entity30 that includes a video clip of @entity0 declaring that even though he 's not on the ballot his policies are on , " every single one of them			2
" the narrator concludes " a vote for @entity30 is a vote for the @entity0 agenda			0
" a similar spot is airing in @entity40 , where the @entity28 also uses the president 's image adjacent to that of @entity16 rep. @entity45 several times in thirty seconds			0
the president served up another line for the @entity4 ad makers on monday in an interview with @entity51 host @entity50			2
@entity0 conceded that campaigning with fellow @entity16 in these competitive areas might only help energize @entity4 turnout			1
but he did n't help those democrats wanting to keep him at arm 's length by saying , " the bottom line is that these are all folks that vote with me			0
they have supported my agenda in @entity63			0
" @entity4 's familiar strategy : tie democrats to @entity1 @entity1 , like the president , has focused her energy traveling to high ticket fundraisers in cities like @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73 , rather appearing at public events in competitive @entity3 districts			1
poll : @entity17 race statistically tied but if you turn on the tv in many of those districts , @entity1 's image is front and center			0
out of the dozen new ads released by the @entity28 on tuesday , seven specifically show @entity1 right next to the @entity16 candidates			2
and these ads come after a barrage of similar spots that ran last month from both the @entity28 and the @entity88			0
the @entity4 strategy is not new			1
ever since @entity1 joined @entity3 leadership ranks , she has become a familiar face in @entity4 campaign commercials			1
the @entity4 effort to tie every swing district @entity96 to @entity1 - who they often label as a " @entity71 liberal " -- reached its peak in the 2010 midterms			1
during that election , @entity3 @entity4 made ousting @entity1 from the speaker 's chair their cause			1
over $ 65 million was spent on ads that specifically targeted @entity1 , according to analysis of tv ads for @entity25 by @entity107 after that election			2
@entity3 @entity16 lost 63 seats and control of the @entity3			0
in the 2012 election the @entity28 and other @entity4 groups again used @entity1 's image , often next to @entity0 's , since he was at the top of the ticket			1
even though @entity1 is n't as big of a threat since her leadership position is diminished , @entity4 strategists say she is still well known , and they believe she maintains a partisan impression with voters that can hurt @entity16 candidates			1
the new round of @entity28 - funded campaign ads showcases the @entity124 theme			0
@entity126 @entity16 rep. @entity125 is criticized for supporting " @entity1 's energy tax			0
" a picture of @entity130 @entity16 candidate @entity129 is placed next to one of @entity1 as the @entity28 ad denounces @entity129 's support of " big government			0
" @entity1 also appears in an @entity28 ad against @entity137 @entity16 candidate @entity136 that highlights @entity139 's support of @entity140			0
the @entity141 , a group with ties to house speaker @entity143 , unveiled a new series of half a dozen ads this week that also prominently use pictures of @entity1			2
the @entity4 group 's television spot says @entity149 , will " take your vote and give it to @entity1 " and emphasizes that @entity153 " " @entity152 voted with @entity1 to support @entity140			1
" @entity1 is n't surprised by the tactic , and in fact she appears to welcomes it			2
last month she called the move " desperate " and argued it was proof that @entity4 " have no ideas			0
" but the @entity160 also smiled and noted that when @entity4 made it about her , " they help me raise money every single day ! " fundraising records do show @entity1 has brought in an impressive haul over this election cycle			1
as of september , @entity1 raised over $ 80 million for @entity16 this election cycle - more than the $ 65 million she raised in the fall before the 2012 election			0
her office said that she personally has raised more than one third of the $ 163 million that the @entity172 raised for the 2014 midterms .			0

president @entity0 not on campaign trail but on airwaves
@entity4 also featuring @entity1 in ads , say she is more " toxic " than the president
*republicans* used similar strategy putting @entity1 in ads in previous elections
@entity1 not surprised by @entity4 strategy , says it helps her raise money for democrats
