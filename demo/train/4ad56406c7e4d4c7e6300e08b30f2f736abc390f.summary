@entity0 -- if @entity4 has danced at the most perilous edges of brinkmanship , we the people helped push them there			1
we did it by voting lawmakers out of office when they work with the other party to craft legislation but then claiming we want @entity4 to compromise and seek bipartisan solutions			1
we 're doing it by sending to office those who promise to toe the line and continue the partisanship we say we despise			1
we did it by allowing our state legislatures to draw congressional districts that are so starkly red or blue that there 's little room for any other hue or viewpoint			2
we did it by congregating in neighborhoods and communities with like - minded people who share our views on politics , religion , and social mores and , as a result , largely electing lawmakers who echo those views			1
we the people have always tended to live , work , and play with and around people who have similar values			1
so no matter how many ways you slice many of the nation 's neighborhoods into districts , the outcome is the sameâ € ” homogeny			2
that 's because you ca n't redistrict social attitudes			2
" we the people do bear responsibility , " said @entity1 senior political analyst @entity52			1
" it 's often been said we get the government we deserve			2
the polarization has come in part because the middle has fallen away and engagement has been left to the far right and far left			1
" the @entity62 : the dubious history of the political posse a house divided it was @entity67 , and few in @entity0 had anything to celebrate			1
the 112th @entity4 had spent weeks in an acrimonious fight over reducing deficits and averting the fiscal cliff			2
the battle ended in a series of late night and early morning votes			2
in those final votes , the 112th @entity4 stayed true to the deeply partisan course that had earned it low national approval ratings , the nickname " do - nothing " and a track record as one of the least effective in recent years			2
in the @entity84 in particular , those votes seemed to reflect the districts those lawmakers represented			1
the chamber 's republicans were starkly divided with 85 voting to support the measure and 151 opposing it , according to an analysis by @entity92 , a political science professor at the @entity93			1
among @entity94 , 172 backed the measure while just 16 were opposed			2
one congressional delegation 's votes seemed to highlight that divide			2
hyper - partisanship dragging down nation in @entity102 , congressional districts are either so red or blue that they trend well above the national average in that regard , said @entity105 , @entity84 editor at the @entity107			1
there are " diametrically opposed viewpoints just across the highway median from each other , " @entity108 said			2
as a result , in votes like the fiscal cliff showdown , members of @entity4 " are simply responding to what their districts want			2
" @entity102 's congressional delegation was nearly evenly split in its fiscal cliff votes			2
the " no " votes included @entity123 rep. @entity123 , who represents the largely white , rural and @entity125 - leaning 5th @entity124 , and @entity127 @entity126			2
due to @entity125 - friendly redistricting of an area that went to @entity94 presidential candidates in the last two election cycles , @entity126 decided not to run for re-election to represent the 13th @entity124			1
those voting for the measure included @entity135 rep. @entity135 , who represents a largely urban , racially mixed 12th @entity124 , and @entity136 rep. @entity136 , who represents the state 's more liberal - leaning @entity137 in the 4th @entity124			0
more ' cliffs ' to come in new @entity4 during 2011 redistricting efforts , @entity102 's lines had to be redrawn to account for a phenomenon that political and social scientists say deeply affects partisanship â € ” population growth near large metro areas and a move away from rural areas			1
@entity102 's redrawn 9th @entity124 's population , currently represented by @entity150 rep. @entity150 , mushroomed by 38 %			0
@entity150 lost urban @entity151 , which includes @entity152 , to @entity127 @entity153 in the general election			0
but he won places like more rural @entity156 , which has a @entity158 hub			0
for several generations , urban areas have tended to trend @entity127 while many rural areas have remained @entity125 strongholds , political demographers say			1
and the number of swing states , those where a presidential candidate could run a competitive campaign and nab voters on the fence , has decreased dramatically over that same period of time			0
even when attempts are made to remove partisanship from the redistricting process , those drawing the lines run up against those types of trends			1
in @entity181 , a citizen - led commission , chosen randomly from a bipartisan pool of applicants , has created some of the most competitive districts in the nation with mixed results			0
it was hoped that by avoiding the state legislature , the redistricting process could steer clear of the type of partisanship that often marks that process			1
however , " @entity94 had figured out the map they wanted to end up with and then they went to community groups and made the pitch to get that , " said @entity191 , a fellow at the @entity192 at @entity193			0
so a process that was supposed to be random was n't completely			0
" it was a huge improvement over the legislature drawing the lines , " @entity191 said			0
" it did n't measure up to the grand hopes and nirvana dreams of some , but it was an improvement			0
" thirteen states have adopted some version of commissions to try to remove politics from redistricting , a task some political scientists and demography experts say is impossible and does n't necessarily result in more balanced districts in this hyper - polarized climate			1
" given the breakdown of traditional institutions and the traditional ways people mix , how do you govern this new country ? " asked @entity216 , co-author of " the @entity217 : why the clustering of @entity225 is tearing us apart			1
" " how do you create one country out of a country that is becoming increasingly a collection of communities ? " the house we built increasingly , people live in communities that are carefully crafted political echo chambers			1
" the dirty little secret is that redistricting only explains part of polarization , " @entity108 said			1
" congressional districts are polarized partly because @entity240 have polarized with their feet			1
it makes it easier for partisan line drawers to draw those lines			0
" every 10 years , just after the @entity240 @entity247 is completed , state lawmakers are charged with the task of redrawing and , in some cases , creating congressional districts that take into account population shifts since the last census			1
it is often a deeply partisan and complicated process in which the party in power usually tries to craft districts that are favorable to them while minimizing the other side 's political heft			1
a number of states , many of them in the @entity266 , with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices , also must get pre-clearance from the @entity270 before tweaking their voting laws and maps			0
in several places , efforts to achieve this equity have resulted in odd shaped districts and court challenges			0
take for example @entity135 's 12th district in @entity102 , a narrow , serpentine strip that nearly dissects the state as it snakes 80 miles along @entity282			0
the district is considered " majority minority " and is reliably @entity94			0
" in states where @entity125 have control , @entity125 have been able to use the @entity287 to pack ( minorities ) into districts so they can win the rest , @entity108 said			0
but that only explains part of why some districts are so partisan			1
across the nation , people are self - sorting into neighborhoods and cities with likeminded peers , political experts and demographers say			1
" we do n't think people move to be around others who vote like themselves			1
they are moving to be around people who are like themselves in every other sort of way , " @entity216 said			1
" @entity308 white people moved to @entity309			1
young black people moved to @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity0 every time we looked at a measure on the country level , differences began to appear , " @entity216 said			1
" civic groups became more specialized			0
churches began to organize around lifestyles			0
lifestyle characteristics began to line up with the vote			0
" in looking at election data from 1992 , 2000 and 2002 , political scientists @entity324 of @entity325 and @entity326 of the @entity327 at @entity328 found that places where spanking is more likely to be used to discipline children tend to lean @entity125			1
areas where timeouts are the norm tend to trend @entity127			2
women in the @entity337 who married and started families later in life tended to vote @entity127 while their @entity342 peers who got a head start on marriage and family building often voted @entity125 , @entity346 demographer @entity345 found			2
five things we learned on @entity349 large numbers of women , minority , gay and young voters helped president @entity355 clinch his victory in the recent general election			0
likewise , a historic number of women and racial minorities were elected to @entity4 from similarly diverse and largely @entity94 states and districts			0
on the other hand , @entity125 presidential contender @entity364 's strong performance among many white voters echoes his party 's congressional representation â € ” largely older , white men			0
during the 2012 election , @entity355 won technology hub @entity371 , continuing a trend of technocrats backing @entity94			0
but he lost the @entity266 , continuing that region 's red streak			0
all of this self - sorting in tiny towns , urban enclaves and suburbs has had a collective impact on the rarefied and increasingly toxic political climate in @entity0 these days			1
the 112th @entity84 was roughly 50 % more polarized in terms of makeup than that of the 102nd , which convened from 1991 to 1993 , @entity92 found in his research			0
the 112th 's @entity387 was more polarized than the 46th @entity387 , which was in office from 1879 - 1881 , just after the reconstruction era that followed the @entity391 , @entity92 found			0
" this is polarization based on choice and self - selection , " @entity216 said			0
" being an adult is accepting lots of different ways of being			0
we are so unsure of our own identities that we are not as accepting as we could be of people of different identities			2
in a sense we are getting what we demand from government			0
we demand our tribe wins			0
so that 's the fight			0
it becomes a fight of tribal differences			0

@entity240 are partly to blame for political partisanship
redistricting is only part of the reason why communities are divided
people moving into areas with like minded peers , *refusing* to hear opposing views complicates issue
this self sorting then *trickles* up to @entity0 in lawmakers we elect and *policies* they support
