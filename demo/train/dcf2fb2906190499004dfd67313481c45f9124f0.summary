a black man who was physically stopped from getting on the @entity2 metro by soccer fans says they should be " locked up " and that he intends to make a complaint			1
filmed on a mobile phone by a bystander waiting on the platform of @entity12 station , the incident took place before a @entity15 tie between @entity17 club @entity16 and @entity18 on tuesday			1
the group , who appear to be @entity16 supporters , can be heard chanting : " we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it			1
" the @entity25 newspaper @entity24 has tracked down the metro passenger at the center of the incident , identifying him only as @entity30 , a father - of - three who was born in @entity2			1
" what happened should not go unpunished , " he told @entity24			1
" these people , these @entity17 supporters , should be found , punished and should be locked up			2
" having talked about it now gives me the courage to go to the police with a complaint			1
in any case , i intend to go to anti racism associations			0
" on his way home from his work as a chief operating officer in business near the metro station , @entity30 says he was not surprised to find himself a victim of an apparent racist incident			2
" they said things to me in @entity17 but i did n't really understand the meaning of what they said , " he explained to @entity24			1
" i do n't speak a word of @entity17			0
" i understood that @entity16 supporters were involved and i made the link with the @entity18 match			1
" i also understood that they were attacking me because of the color of my skin			0
" you know , i live with racism , i was n't really surprised by what happened to me , even if it was the first time in the metro			2
" i stayed for a long time in front of them			0
one person came to say that i had been brave to resist people like that			0
" no ( metro ) user took up my defense but , in any case , what could one do ? " while the metro moved out of the @entity12 station with the @entity16 fans on board , @entity30 waited to catch the next train and went home			1
the 33 - year - old said he did not tell anyone about what happened , even though he realized he had lost his phone during the scramble with the soccer supporters			0
he did not know the altercation had been filmed by @entity90 expatriate @entity89 , who broke the story by sending the video to @entity90 newspaper @entity93 , which then posted it on its website			2
" i returned home without telling anyone about what had happened , not my wife nor my children , " said @entity30 told @entity24			1
" what would i say to my children ? that papa was shoved in the metro because he was black ? that 's useless			1
" @entity30 may have been unaware of the ramifications of the incident but it has acted as a catalyst to more soul searching about soccer 's seeming inability to root out racism in the global game			0
@entity16 has vowed to support any criminal action brought against its fans involved in the @entity2 altercation			1
" such behavior is abhorrent and has no place in football or society , " the @entity117 club said in a statement released wednesday			0
" we will support any criminal action against those involved in such behavior , and should evidence point to the involvement of @entity16 season ticket holders or members the club will take the strongest possible action against them including banning orders			1
" both @entity25 and @entity90 police have said they will analyze the footage			2
@entity135 , the body which governs @entity138 football , said it was appalled by the footage , but as it occurred outside of the stadium it could not take any punitive action			0
@entity142 , the president of football 's global governing body @entity143 , also took to @entity145 to register his disapproval			0
" i also condemn the actions of a small group of @entity16 fans in @entity2 , " tweeted @entity142			1
" there is no place for racism in football ! " @entity155 boss @entity154 -- the only black manager in the @entity117 -- was asked to comment on the incident in @entity2 during his media conference , thursday			1
" i do n't believe they are @entity16 fans or fans of football , " said @entity154			1
" i believe they are acting in a manner which we all think is a thing of the past			0
" those views are intrinsic in everyday life			0
i 've been saying for a long time these are social issues which manifest themselves in the football world			0
" it would be good to see what the authorities are going to do to either weed these people out , what sanctions they 're going to enforce , to try to make this an avoidable situation in the future			2
" this is not the first racism allegation to be leveled against @entity181 club @entity16 in recent times			2
in 2012 , team captain @entity183 was banned for four matches and fined $ 356,000 for racially abusing @entity155 defender @entity185			0
@entity183 was , however , found not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing at @entity187 in july of the same year			0
former @entity188 and @entity190 defender @entity189 , the brother of @entity185 , questioned whether football has the power to eradicate racism			0
" the racist scene on the metro with the @entity16 fans - disgraceful behavior obviously			1
but can football change this ? does it have the power ? " he wrote on @entity145 , thursday			0
" football has come a long way since the @entity204 but are we all guilty of becoming a bit complacent ? " football has done a lot over the years to combat racism			0
. but society has to do more to make change or is there too much hatred in society ? " opinion : not all soccer fans are racist hooligans			2
