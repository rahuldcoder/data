-- @entity1 has been called " the most famous highway in the world , " and it remains the ultimate road trip			1
within the @entity5 and to travelers from around the globe , @entity1 is on par with the @entity8 and the @entity9 as an icon of @entity5			1
@entity1 offers today 's travelers the chance to press their noses against the window peering into another time , and it shows us an @entity5 that still exists off the modern freeway system			1
here 's a glimpse into that world , with seven things most folks do n't know about @entity1			1
over 2,000 of @entity1 's original 2,448 connected miles are still approachable , if not always drivable			1
while there are many lovely stretches and remarkable towns to be found along the way , " roadies " still debate which is the top stretch of @entity1 for a modern day road trip			1
when autumn leaves fall some say the best unbroken drives happen along @entity34 's 400 miles of the old road , much of it uninterrupted by the interstate			0
or possibly the most memorable drive is the 158 continuous miles on @entity1 heading west from @entity40 , @entity41 , and on to the @entity43 state line and @entity44			1
uncontested : @entity45 has always had the shortest length of this road in any of the eight @entity1 states , and all 13 historic miles are drivable today through @entity50 and @entity51			2
@entity52 conceived of " @entity53 " on a late 1937 summer drive from @entity55 west on @entity1 , which he called the " long concrete path			1
" @entity52 's wife , @entity57 , suggested the title of the book ( in which he called @entity1 " the @entity1 " )			1
she was inspired by " the @entity61			0
" the song 's first verse reads : " mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord ; he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored			0
" @entity72 close to home the book 's @entity74 translated into foreign - edition titles such as " @entity77 " in @entity78 and " @entity79 " in @entity80			0
of the 116 episodes in the 1960 - 1964 tv show " @entity1 " ( yes , always spelled with a lower - case " r " ) only two episodes were actually filmed on @entity1			2
the cast and crew moved on location to 81 @entity5 communities in 23 states			0
they also made two side trips to @entity93 , to film episodes in @entity95 and @entity96			0
of the two destinations on @entity1 that were part of the series , one is in @entity101 , @entity43 , and the other is on a pre- 1937 @entity1 stretch near @entity104 , @entity105			1
@entity1 is the only national highway to be decommissioned from the original 1926 grid that created the @entity108			1
it all came to a head on october 13 , 1984 , when a new , efficient six - mile freeway heading west at @entity111 , @entity41 , opened to traffic			0
that 's when the last portion of @entity1 was bypassed by the interstates			2
because of the new freeway , @entity116 no longer intersected with @entity1			2
it now arched away from " the old road " and ended any necessity for motorists to travel on @entity1 to get between @entity55 and @entity121 how the world welcomed fall ( or spring ) the town of @entity111 had negotiated three interstate off - ramps to ensure travelers had access to their services			1
in return , @entity111 today is a wonderful place to experience @entity1 memorabilia and gain a sense of the road 's history ( and it is also gateway to the @entity135 )			2
with @entity111 bypassed , the @entity136 voted in favor of the " elimination of @entity5 @entity1 " on june 26 , 1985			2
@entity139 met @entity140 within days of @entity139 and his wife @entity141 arriving in @entity121 , after the couple 's february 1946 drive across the country , part of it on @entity1			1
the @entity147 had driven @entity148 from their @entity150 home to @entity151 , where they in fact did motor west on @entity1			2
inspired by @entity141 's suggestion of " get your kicks on @entity1 " as a song title , @entity139 had written less than half of " ( @entity155 " when he met @entity140			1
@entity139 sat at @entity140 's piano at the @entity160 on @entity161 and played his half - song for the first time			0
@entity140 liked it so much he joined @entity139 and played along			0
@entity140 told @entity139 to finish the song and committed to recording it for his upcoming album			0
we dare you to take a real vacation @entity139 and @entity141 got out their @entity170 maps to help frame the next verse , concentrating on their overnight stops			0
@entity141 said years later , " what i really ca n't believe is that he does n't have @entity175 in the song			0
" @entity45 is the only one of the @entity1 states @entity139 did not reference , while @entity179 -- for reasons of rhyme -- is the one place out of driving sequence			1
keeping his word , @entity140 recorded the song on march 16 , 1946			0
and the @entity187 recorded it for their first album			0
@entity1 has had many nicknames , such as " @entity5 's @entity191 , " and " the @entity192			2
" but @entity1 is properly co-designated " the @entity1			1
" @entity193 , who spent his younger years in and around @entity1 communities , was the most widely read newspaper writer of his time and by 1933 he was the top male box - office draw in the @entity5 movie industry , becoming " honorary mayor " of @entity200			2
when he died in a 1935 plane crash , radio stations in many parts of the country went silent for 30 minutes out of respect for their most quoted broadcaster			0
while the highway signage for this designation seems sporadic , it is official			1
a wonderful tribute to the man and his times is the @entity213 located in @entity214 , just outside of @entity215			0
@entity34 's @entity216 , " the father of @entity1 , " was so confident his proposed road from @entity55 to @entity121 would be designated " @entity218 " that he printed 60,000 brochures promoting @entity218 going through his state in 1926			1
@entity216 began erecting @entity218 road signs along @entity34 's state road			0
( of course , all of these had to be destroyed when the @entity1 designation was stipulated later that year			2
) the decision by @entity216 and his compatriots to accept " 66 " as their favored route 's designation was made in @entity231 , @entity232 , on april 30 , 1926 , giving that town recognition as " the birthplace of @entity1			0

the @entity1 news website is independent clearinghouse of news and events along @entity1			0
