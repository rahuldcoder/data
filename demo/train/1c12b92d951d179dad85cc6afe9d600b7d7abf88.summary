-- the father of terrorism suspect @entity2 talked about his son 's extremist views with someone from the @entity7 and a report was prepared , but the report was not circulated outside the agency , a reliable source told @entity0 's @entity11 on tuesday			1
had that information been shared , the 23 - year - old @entity12 who is alleged to have bungled an attempt to blow up a jetliner as it was landing in @entity15 , @entity16 , on @entity17 might have been denied passage on the @entity21 flight , the source said			1
@entity23 officials said the father , a former @entity12 banker , expressed his concerns about his son 's radicalization during at least one meeting and several calls with officials at the embassy in @entity12			1
the information on @entity2 had been sent to @entity7 headquarters in @entity34 , @entity35 , but it sat there for five weeks and was not disseminated , the source said			1
federal authorities have charged @entity2 with trying to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight from @entity41 , @entity42 , made its final approach to @entity15			1
the device failed to fully detonate , instead setting off a fire at his seat			2
an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the federal government had information that should have been assessed and meshed with other information " that would have allowed us to disrupt the attempted terrorist attack " before the suspect boarded the jet			2
" what we have here is a situation in which the failings were individual , organizational , systemic and technological , " the official said			0
" we ended up in a situation where a single point of failure in the system put our security at risk , where human error was compounded by systemic deficiencies in a way that we can not allow to continue			0
" but an intelligence official said that the son 's name , passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated			2
" i 'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence somehow withheld that would have put @entity2 on the no - fly list , " the official said			1
@entity85 spokesman @entity84 said department staff did what they were supposed to have done by sending a cable to the @entity90 in @entity91 about the matter			0
@entity84 said any decision to have revoked the suspect 's visa would have been an interagency decision			0
but a @entity23 government official said the information in the cable offered nothing specific and was just one of hundreds of such reports that the center evaluates daily			0
the bureaucratic fingerpointing erupted shortly after president @entity105 on tuesday blamed " a mix of human and systemic failures " for the incident and directed that preliminary findings into the matter be delivered to the @entity109 by thursday .			0
