crammed into a prison cell with 36 other people , the man debated his fate as he listened to the shelling			2
outside , fighters with the @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity8 fired mortars at the anti-terrorism detention facility in @entity11 , where fierce battles raged between the @entity14 splinter group and @entity7 security forces			1
with the facility close to being overrun by @entity19 fighters , the prison guards did the unthinkable			1

the account mirrors allegations put forward by @entity29 , which released a report friday saying it has evidence pointing to a pattern of " extrajudicial executions " of @entity35 detainees by government forces and @entity38 militias in @entity11 , @entity39 and @entity40 , cities where @entity7 forces were either routed or have been locked in fierce battles with @entity19 fighters and allied @entity35 militants			1
" the killings suggest a worrying pattern of reprisal attacks against @entity35 in retaliation for @entity19 gains , " said @entity44 , @entity29 's senior crisis response adviser , who is currently in northern @entity7			1
the government is aware of the @entity29 allegations but has yet to see any evidence , said @entity53 , spokesman for the @entity54 , which oversees the country 's judicial system			1
" at this stage , this is all just media reporting , " he told @entity22 on friday			0
" no witnesses have come forward , and no families have come forward with such claims			0
no one has officially asked for an investigation			0
" he called for the rights group to provide evidence , saying that " we are still monitoring and checking , and we will keep checking , " adding that " under @entity7 law , we can not move on it without claims and evidence			0
" ' he was in the prison			0
he was killed ' survivors and witnesses tell @entity29 that @entity7 prison guards carried out the slaughter before @entity7 forces withdrew			1
a video obtained by @entity22 , confirmed by @entity29 as one of the rooms where the killings took place in @entity11 , shows a prison cell , the floor slick with blood , where bodies of men are piled on top of one another			1
they appear to have fallen where they were shot			0
in that same video , a woman in a black abaya with a printed head scarf stands over her brother , brushing flies from his body			1
she said she found his body among others in a room in the @entity11 detention facility			1
" he was in the prison , " said the woman , clearly in shock			0
" asked how many bodies were among those with her brother , she said : " they killed a lot			2
" bodies found in @entity39 a similar scene appeared to play out at the anti-terrorism detention facility in @entity39 , 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) from @entity11 , @entity29 said , where some of the dozens of bloated , twisted bodies found in a ditch were believed to have been executed by @entity7 guards before they withdrew			1
a man , whom @entity22 is not identifying at his request , said he was being held at the same facility with about 80 others			2
he said he was held without charges after security forces picked him up eight months earlier			2
" the guards were screaming out names			0
they took 15 of them and handcuffed them together , " said the man , who is a university student			0
then they were taken away , he said			0
later , as @entity19 fighters shelled the @entity39 facility , detainees in one of the cells began chanting " allahu akbar			1
" that 's when , the man said , one of the guards opened a cell and threw a grenade into it			2
" thank @entity141 , they were busy with the clashes , and they did n't have time to go through all the cells , " he said			0
the man said militants , presumably @entity19 fighters , eventually released him and the other prisoners			1
" they said , ' you are free			0
whoever wants to go , swear allegiance to us and you can go home , ' " he said			0
the man said that when he heard that bodies had been found in a ditch near an abandoned potato factory , he went to see them			2
and there , he said , were the bodies of some of the men taken from the detention facility			0
@entity167 details alleged @entity19 killings stories of executions and killings by both sides have swirled since @entity19 fighters seized portions of northern @entity7 in a lightning advance that stunned @entity7 security forces			1
the @entity29 report comes the same day that @entity167 said two mass graves thought to contain the bodies of @entity7 soldiers , police and civilians , killed by @entity19 fighters and their militant allies , were found in @entity184 's hometown of @entity185			1
using satellite imagery and publicly available photographs purportedly released by @entity19 , @entity167 said it appeared that @entity19 fighters in @entity185 executed three groups of men a short distance from the former @entity7 leader 's @entity192 on the banks of the @entity195			1
" the analysis suggests that @entity19 killed between 160 and 190 men in at least two locations between june 11 and 14 , " the rights group said in its report			2
" the number of victims may well be much higher , but the difficulty of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation			0
" who is the @entity19 ? @entity209 has armed drones over @entity211 , official says @entity19 gains in @entity7 put @entity214 forces on highest alert			2

one man says security force *members* shot , killed prisoners as @entity19 fighters approached
a woman says she found brother 's body among many others at @entity11 facility
@entity29 alleges that government forces , @entity38 militias executed @entity35 detainees
