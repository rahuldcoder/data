on the streets of @entity2 , we bear witness to what many see as a bold decision on fuel subsidies is also uncovering decades of frustration and corruption			1
on the heels of re-election , president @entity9 lifted fuel subsides on petrol in an effort to cut $ 8 billion a year from the government 's budget			1
petrol was artificially low at @entity18 45 cents a liter and -- not surprisingly -- prices doubled overnight , both at the pump and on the black market			1
economists suggest the @entity25 's resolution pushed through by the president was the correct policy to implement on paper , but politics is eventually determined by what happens on the street			0
and the " street " right now is crying foul			0
@entity2 launched a nationwide strike on monday			2
some protests over the end of fuel subsidies were marred by clashes that left 16 people dead and 205 injured , according to a tally collected tuesday by the @entity2 @entity41			1
nigerians are worn down by inherent corruption			0
the harsh reality is that despite being in the big league of oil producers with reserves of 36 billion barrels , the country rank , according to the @entity50 , is 133rd in the world when it comes to per capita income -- the lowest performance of a country with this level of natural resources			2
that per capita income ranking is just above its poor status in @entity61 's corruption index where @entity2 took the 143rd position in 2011 alongside @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
this is a tale of two @entity68 -- one that has garnered $ 67 billion of foreign direct investment , growing at 7 - 8 % a year , and being singled out by @entity71 as being one of the " @entity74 " economies			1
@entity75 coined that phrase to group together the next promising bunch of highly populated , fast growing economies for the early part of the @entity81			0
@entity2 is known as a lower - middle income economy , a powerful voice within @entity84 and the @entity85 , but a frontier market classification because of the political risk and poor rankings on corruption surveys			1
@entity2 's status as a " @entity74 " economy must seem a world away from the 57 % of @entity2 who still live on less than $ 2 a day , according to the @entity94			1
@entity2 struggle to cope with notoriously poor infrastructure , with electricity in short supply and power cuts still commonplace			2
" at the moment @entity2 's electricity generation officially is about similar to what @entity104 in @entity106 does and consumes , " said @entity99 of the emerging market investment group @entity101 , " so @entity2 's growing , booming 7 - 8 percent even with so little electricity			1
if they could electricity reform done too , this could be a boom story for a decade			0
" that is a big " if " and certainly why @entity2 have taken to the street			2
president @entity9 faces backlash because the population view subsidies as the only benefit it gets from the vast hydrocarbon resources			0
many are asking a simple question : will the money being saved from fuel subsides be spent wisely ? the track record is not a promising one			1
according to the @entity94 , 80 % of the oil wealth has really only benefited 1 % of the population			0
it is worth noting , there are other , big complications			0
this is a country that remains divided between north and south along religious lines			0
the president this week suggested the @entity134 sect @entity135 has supporters within the government , creating tensions amongst the ranks of his cabinet			0
a spate of church bombings in december adds another level of uncertainty for a government that says it wants to continue to pursue reforms			0
president @entity9 was given a mandate with his second term to deliver change and make the country an attractive destination for foreign investment			2
what @entity2 who are protesting are saying , it should be an attractive place to live day - to - day as well .			1

@entity2 lifted fuel subsides on petrol in an effort to cut $ 8 billion a year
the deadly protests *erupted* as gas prices suddenly doubled
@entity2 is considered by @entity71 an emerging economy with attractive growth
most @entity2 , however , survive on less than u.s. $ 2 a day
