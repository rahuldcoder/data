@entity0 , @entity1 -- as if on cue , @entity3 entered the makeshift shrine to @entity6 and shed a tear			1
this place of reverence to " @entity10 , " the president of @entity1 for 14 years , popped up in this poor neighborhood after @entity6 's death last month			1
@entity3 said her devotion to @entity6 is unshakable			0
but she understands why even some who supported the late president were reluctant to vote for his handpicked successor , @entity17			1
" i think a lot of people did n't know @entity17 so they did n't vote ( for him ) but here we are , it was very close , " @entity3 said			1
for this country of 29 million , struggling economically , the election was perhaps too close for comfort			2
at least seven people were killed and 61 were injured in post-election violence across @entity1 , state media reported tuesday , citing @entity1 's top prosecutor			1
while the government claims these attacks were against government supporters , @entity2 could not independently verify the reports			0
@entity17 secured 50.8 % of votes in sunday 's election , while opposition candidate @entity35 won 49 % , @entity1 's @entity32 said			1
as the crisis continues , the economy limps along			0
even @entity1 government predictions indicate the country could see inflation hit 30 % this year , one of the highest rates in the world			1
and then there are the food shortages			1
currency restrictions and price controls have compromised the economy ; there are shortages of basic goods like flour , sugar , rice , even cornmeal , a @entity1 staple			1
we went to one bakery in central @entity0 where the owner told us he was working with his last three sacks of flour			0
the bakery is limiting purchases of bread to four loaves per purchase until the supply of flour stabilizes			0
it 's a situation that 's difficult to understand considering @entity1 is a petro - state with the largest proven reserves of oil on the planet			1
" i have no idea when i 'm going to get any more flour and usually i have about 50 sacks on hand for the month , " said the bakery owner , who did not want to be identified for fear of government retribution			0
@entity80 seems to be rising among @entity1 , no matter who they voted for			2
the government 's threats against the opposition grow more ominous by the hour			0
" you will not go downtown to @entity0 to fill it with blood and death , " @entity17 warned the opposition , saying their protests were illegal			2
he added that he believed the @entity90 was funding and encouraging the protests			0
@entity35 responded with a call for calm , yet another demand for an election recount , and most importantly a plea for protesters to ignore his earlier calls to protest on wednesday and stay home instead			2
he said he feared the government would incite violence at what he hoped would be a peaceful demonstration			0

back at the @entity6 shrine , where he is already known as " @entity115 , " a saint , there seems little interest in following the sparring between the government and the opposition			0
people were returning to work and school and making their way onto the crowded commuter buses that wind through the poor barrios			0
but this is hardly the " divine inspiration " @entity6 had hoped to give @entity1 after grooming his successor before his death			2
@entity17 had a double - digit lead over the opposition after @entity6 's death but that evaporated in a short , 10 - day campaign			1
even the opposition told @entity2 they considered this a " miracle			0
" and it suggests some loss of enthusiasm in @entity1 's @entity141 socialist movement -- if not its namesake .			2
