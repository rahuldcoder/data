the @entity1 revolution has a new , and shocking , image : it 's the @entity1 flag , but the eagle in the middle has been replaced by a simple blue bra			1
the image refers to the recent , savage beating of an abaya - clad female protester by @entity1 military forces			1
graphic videos of the beating , captured on phones and uploaded to @entity13 and @entity14 , have quickly proliferated			1
they show a limp woman being dragged by her arms along the street			2
her abaya is ripped open , exposing her naked torso and blue bra			0
security forces surround her , many wielding batons			0
as the beating progresses , the guards hit her and one even stomps on her			2
photos of the man bringing his heavy boot down on her bare stomach made the front page of newspapers around the world			0
in response , thousands of women -- and men -- marched tuesday in @entity38 's @entity37			2
observers say it was the largest demonstration of women in @entity1 in decades			1
not since 1919 , when women mobilized under the leadership of feminist @entity44 in anti-colonial demonstrations against the @entity46 have so many @entity1 women taken to the streets			1
( after representing @entity1 women at the @entity50 in @entity51 in 1923 , @entity44 returned to @entity38 and very publicly removed her veil			1
) women have played an important role in @entity1 's modern revolution but have struggled to translate their activism into a political role in the new , emerging system			1
they have been excluded from important decision - making bodies , and the military leadership declined to continue a @entity62 - era quota for women that ensured them at least 64 seats in parliament			2
based on early election results , it appears that few women will win a place in the new government			2
nevertheless , one intrepid woman , @entity73 , is breaking ground with her candidacy for president			0
the campaign of @entity78 , a well - known television presenter , at first was shocking , and certainly quixotic , with polls indicating her support is less than 1 %			0
but her persistence has gained her credibility			0
while she has little chance of winning , she is helping to normalize the idea of women in politics -- an idea that is deeply contested in @entity1 society			1
leaders of @entity90 parties , which gained a surprising 20 % of the vote in the first rounds of elections , have spoken out against women running for office			0
the recent women 's protest may breathe life into a movement that desperately needs new energy			1
in the early weeks of the revolution , women activists tried to bring attention to women 's issues but never succeeded in getting the masses behind them			1
a women 's march in @entity37 to mark @entity107 on march 8 ended badly			1
only a few hundred women showed up , and they were soon harassed by a mob of angry men who shouted at them to go home and warned that their demands for rights were against @entity115			2
around the same time , the @entity1 military rounded up scores of women demonstrators , and in a show of raw intimidation , subjected many of them to " virginity tests			1
" military leaders at first denied the accusations , and later defended their abuse by claiming the women " were not like your daughter or mine			0
" in a remarkable show of courage , one of the victims , @entity135 , is pursuing a criminal case against the military for her ordeal			0
the only one of the 17 victims willing to take her case to court , @entity139 is challenging not only the heavy - handed tactics of the military but also the social stigma associated with her issue			0
the woman attacked by the military in the recent protests has declined to come forward , so for now she is only known as " blue bra girl			2
" but her mistreatment seems to be a galvanizing force			0
thousands of people joined the march through @entity38 on tuesday , many of them taking to the streets for the first time in outrage			0
organizers of the march used the hashtag @entity161 on @entity163 to encourage people to join them			0
some of the protesters held giant posters of the blue bra / flag icon			0
others carried photographs of the beating			0
men formed a cordon around the women , chanting " the women of @entity1 are the red line			1
" still , many @entity1 were not supportive			2
bloggers and tweeters offered negative comments on the blue bra girl -- criticizing her for being out in public protesting in the first place and accusing her of being provocative for not wearing more clothes under her abaya			0
it remains to be seen whether these new humiliations for @entity1 women will lead to significant changes			1
but given the country 's deep - seated patriarchy , women in @entity1 should not take their rights for granted .			1

@entity193 : videos of vicious beating of @entity1 woman have prompted protests
women have been active in revolution but largely excluded from political process , she says
@entity204 says the battle for women 's rights in @entity1 is a vital but *difficult* struggle
