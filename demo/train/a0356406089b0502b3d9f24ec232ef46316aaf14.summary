-- @entity1 will carry the weight of his country 's expectations when he represents @entity5 on home turf at this summer 's @entity7			1
the midfielder was @entity5 's @entity9 in 2009 and plays for @entity11 team @entity10			1
@entity12 , 28 , tells @entity0 's @entity13 about growing up in a tough @entity15 neighborhood , the responsibilities that go with being a professional footballer , and his hopes for the " @entity19 , " and how he does n't think the @entity7 will go to an @entity21 team this year			1
@entity0 : you grew up in @entity23 -- what kind of neighborhood is it ? @entity1 : it 's famous for bad stuff			1
a lot of burglars and gangsterism -- and poverty			2
@entity0 : what were your options when you were young ? what did people want to become at your age at that time ? @entity39 : when you 're that age growing up in @entity23 you look up to the drug dealers , because they are like your heroes			0
they drive fancy cars , with nice clothes			0
so you just want to be like them			0
but i had a strict mom and school was the first thing on my mind			0
she always wanted me to go to school and just focus on school			0
and soccer was always after school			0
@entity0 : what are your thoughts about the @entity7 ? @entity39 : we have to go out there and show the world we 're not in the @entity7 just because we 're hosting it			1
we have to show them we 've got a spirit , the @entity21 spirit , in us and also the talent and the mentality to win games			1
and we have to go past the group stages			0
@entity21 football academy creates future stars @entity0 : what does it mean to play in front of a local crowd ? @entity39 : it 's an unbelievable feeling because when you hear the vuvuzela , it 's like you 're hearing an elephant			1
you feel that you 're in @entity5			1
it 's also the noise of people , the excitement of other people when they sing and dance			2
the game means a lot to them and for us playing for the country			2
it 's a special feeling			2
@entity0 : do you feel like you 're part of the new @entity5 ? @entity39 : yes , i feel i am part of the new @entity5 and all that is thanks to [ @entity93 ] @entity92 , of course , for changing it			1
if it was n't for him , i do n't think i would have been given the opportunity			2
he 's changed a lot , and for me to be a famous football player -- i 've got a lot of responsibility and i 'm going to represent the country			1
@entity0 : if you did n't have the talent and determination you have , where would you be if you were back in @entity5 ? @entity39 : that 's a tough one			1
i think if i did n't get opportunity to go to a soccer school , i think selling drugs -- something like that			2
@entity0 : tell me more about the passion of @entity21 for football			1
is it almost a religion ? @entity39 : it is , because the people hate losing			0
@entity5 are a bunch of impatient people ... and it can make people put guns down just to come watch a game			1
that 's how special the game is			2
i ca n't describe the way people are crazy about soccer			2
@entity0 : do you think an @entity21 team can win the @entity7 ? @entity39 : i 'm more of a realist			1
i do n't think it will happen in 2010 , but it will be something special if an @entity21 nation can win it because it 's on the continent			1
i think if it was somewhere in @entity141 , with the heat , then you could have said an @entity21 nation could win			1
but in @entity5 it will be winter , so it will be more in the favor of the @entity146			1
@entity147 turns rugby passion into @entity150 vision @entity0 : what has football taught you about life ? @entity39 : it can be a roller coaster			0
i 've had a lot of downs in my career but hopefully now it 's the turn to go up			0
but with injuries , that 's the down part of it , and being away from your family -- the sacrifices you have to make			0
you must leave all of your family and friends behind and go away just to get a better living , to make sure your family get a better living			0
@entity0 : do you think @entity21 players maybe have more people counting on them than , say , a player from @entity146 ? @entity39 : definitely			1
as @entity21 players we know we have a big family back home [ and if ] one of the kids or cousins make it , you have to look after the whole family			1
you have to work for them			0
and of course , they 're praying for you , for the blessings that you get			0
so you have to help the whole family to get a better life			0
@entity0 : how important is it to the sense of camaraderie that you 're representing " the @entity19 " ? @entity39 : it is a rainbow nation and it 's a mix of white , mixed race , black players			0
for us , when we 're in camp , we 're a family			0
there 's a lot of jokes			0
we laugh a lot and there 's always happiness in the team			2
the players are always singing and just having fun			0
that 's what you want : a happy home we hope will bring results .			0
