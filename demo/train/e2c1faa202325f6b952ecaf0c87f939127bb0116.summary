@entity0 , @entity1 -- as christmas season went into full swing this year , @entity4 's 7 - year - old son came home from school with an assignment : make a poster illustrating his family holiday traditions			2
the boy was n't sure how to proceed because he and his family are @entity14 , not @entity15 , and they have no holidays during the @entity18 season			1
thus , @entity4 encountered the " december dilemma " -- the term used for the quandaries and anxieties non-christians and interfaith couples face during @entity18 season			1
@entity4 , a @entity14 faith spokesman who lives in @entity27 , @entity28 , said he saw the poster assignment as a " teachable moment " for his 4 - , 7 - and 10 - year - old sons who associated holiday traditions with @entity18			1
he reminded his boys that @entity14 have a gift - giving and charity period in february called @entity36 , a stretch of time not unlike the @entity18 season			1
and he helped his son design the poster about that holiday , which precedes a fasting period and then the @entity42 in march			2
" his classmates asked him questions about the holiday , and one of his friends came up to him and wants to celebrate that holiday , " @entity4 said , pleased that his son 's peers helped him reaffirm his identity			2
navigating the @entity18 season can be a challenge for the millions of people who do n't celebrate the holiday			1
many acknowledge and sometime embrace the season 's customs , such as gift - giving and sending out greeting cards , while at the same time they are conscious of maintaining their own religious identities			1
" they strongly try to maintain their own integrity , but they really want to find bridges across holidays , " said the rev. dr. @entity58 , a professor at the @entity59 in @entity60			2
" i think that 's the majority			0
" @entity67 , chairman of the @entity68 , is a @entity69 and does n't celebrate @entity18			1
but he said he admires the @entity15 celebrations of his friends and has attended @entity72 services at several churches			0
" hindus are typically more open - minded and tolerant			0
@entity74 is very comfortable in accommodating a diversity of ideas , " he said			0
" it is very common for @entity69 families to have @entity18 trees at their homes , purely as a fun thing to do for their children			1
when they visit shopping malls , @entity69 parents in general are comfortable with a photo - op for their little kids with @entity87			0
" but at the same time , there are pressures about the encroachment of @entity91 on @entity69 life			0
" television commercials , good selection of merchandise and great sale prices persuade @entity69 - @entity97 to take advantage of the shopping spree , " @entity67 said			0
" several @entity69 temples have risen up to the challenge and added some special @entity69 prayers and ceremonies to engage @entity69 who are on winter holidays but not on overseas vacations			2
" dr. @entity107 , an @entity0 - area pediatrician , is a @entity108 -- practicing a religion with @entity111 roots			0
growing up in @entity112 , @entity113 , she said her parents " felt comfortable letting us celebrate @entity18 , " perhaps to help fit into @entity97 society and maintain a sense of normalcy			1
" the spirit and meaning of @entity18 , of helping others and of giving , are nice messages			1
therefore , it is hard to consciously object to it , " @entity107 said			0
" @entity108 , as a whole , are a minority in @entity111			0
many @entity108 celebrate @entity69 holidays , so celebrating @entity18 with @entity87 and a tree and presents is no different			1
since @entity108 wholeheartedly believe in ' ahimsa ' -- peace toward all living beings in thought , word and action -- the @entity18 spirit is a very jain - like philosophy			1
" the religious aspect of @entity18 -- believing @entity139 is the savior and that december 25 is his birthday -- is not celebrated in @entity108 , but the customs and symbols are interwoven into daily life , she said			1
" now that i have toddlers in the house , they come home with stories about @entity18			1
they sing songs about @entity152 and @entity87 , and @entity153 , and @entity154			0
but it 's @entity87 that everyone talks about , so they talk about him as well , " @entity107 said			0
" i use @entity87 as a behavioral modification tool			0
' @entity87 's watching you , so you better be good ' works infinitely better than timeout			0
my kids will be living in this country ; they will have a hard enough time anyway with their names and food and other cultural traditions ; @entity18 -- and the @entity18 spirit -- is not one tradition that i want to take away from them			1
" @entity139 plays a role in the theology of other religions , such as the @entity14 faith and @entity174 , even though those faiths do n't observe @entity18 as a religious holiday			1
the @entity18 season presented a struggle for @entity179 , director of the @entity181 office of the @entity182			1
he grew up in @entity183 , @entity184 , area schools , where he sang the ever - present @entity18 carols and made the gingerbread houses in schools but did n't have a tree in his home			1
" we definitely had a little bit of anxiety in childhood , " @entity179 said			0
but that changed as he grew up and refined his @entity97 @entity182 persona amid the @entity97 atmosphere of diversity and tolerance			0
now , where he and his family live in northern @entity202 , " we do n't celebrate @entity18			1
we celebrate our holidays " -- pointing , for example , to @entity205 after @entity206 and @entity207 after the hajj pilgrimage			2
but he welcomes the goodwill of the season -- the gift - exchanges with @entity213 neighbors and the requests from schoolteachers to talk about @entity182 holidays			1
" there 's definitely going to be a level of discomfort , especially for those who are n't used to that diverse culture that we belong to , " he said			0
but the unease spawns discussion , presenting a useful opportunity to help young people and newcomers , he said			0
for @entity229 , the eight - day holiday of @entity154 happens to fall during the @entity18 season			1
@entity154 is wildly popular and observed , with its special foods , gift - giving and candle lighting , and with its symbols such as the menorah -- a candelabrum -- and the dreidel , a toy that spins like a top			0
compared with other non-christians , many @entity229 have drawn a sharper line in the sand when it comes to observing @entity18 , a stance informed by historic , theological and self - preservation reasons			1
that attitude emerged recently during a young professionals ' get - together at an @entity111 restaurant outside @entity0 sponsored by the @entity249 and @entity250			0
people there indicated that attending @entity18 - themed holiday parties , exchanging greeting cards and wishing @entity15 friends " @entity18 " are surely not uncommon or unacceptable among @entity229			1
but some practices are widely shunned -- such as plunking one 's child on @entity87 's lap at the mall , and deplored -- such as assigning kids in public schools to write a letter to @entity87			0
" it 's a beautiful season			2
it brings out a joy , " said @entity265 , who organized the @entity229 - @entity111 event			0
" but i 'm not going to celebrate it			0
" interfaith couples celebrate their diversity during the @entity18 season			1
@entity273 , a certified public accountant who is @entity229 , and @entity275 , a dentist who is @entity69 , are planning their marriage next year			0
they will have an interfaith household and said they hope to raise children to understand both of their traditions			2
at their home in @entity0 , they 've set up a holiday tree decorated with @entity69 and @entity229 ornaments			0
non-religious @entity97 embrace a december " secular holiday " called @entity288			2
@entity289 , vice chair of the @entity290 and member of the @entity293 @entity292 , said the holiday can uplift " atheist , humanist and nonreligious " people who feel left out and isolated during @entity18			1
it was a perfect fit for him when it came along , he said , because " it corresponds with my humanity - based ethics and values , without any supernatural or theistic beliefs			0
my ' holiday season ' is @entity288 and @entity302 -- that 's what i celebrate			2
" " the only dilemma , in my experience is , if @entity18 is part of the larger family tradition , and then some family members reject us for not believing in it anymore			2
we 're not out to take @entity18 away from anyone who wants to celebrate it -- there is no ' war on @entity18 , ' " @entity289 said			2
how do @entity15 themselves see the presence and practices of @entity315 during @entity18 ? while many would like to see non-christians convert to @entity91 , they also recognize that the @entity97 is a " diverse society " and that conversion " is not even on their radar screen , " said @entity58 , the theology professor			1
" there 's a deep @entity97 virtue in respecting religious differences , " he said .			2

non-christians and interfaith couples often face quandaries and anxieties during holidays
many acknowledge and sometime embrace customs of the @entity18 season
others remain conscious of maintaining their own religious identities
