@entity0 has elicited a lot of hand - wringing by investors and fans alike lately , even as its chief competition @entity6 seems to be prompting nothing but applause			1
turns out selling a wider variety of phones and tablets is a good strategy after all			2
while @entity0 was on its way to the company 's first profit decline in almost a decade during the first three months of the year , @entity6 's net profit grew 42 percent in the same period to 7.2 trillion won -- about $ 6.5 billion @entity18 -- from 5 trillion won a year earlier			1
it was a record - setting quarter for the @entity21 consumer electronics maker			0
" our business earnings grew from the previous quarter driven by an increase in smartphone sales and decreased marketing expenses , " @entity22 , @entity6 's vice president of mobile planning told analysts			1
in other words , @entity6 sold more phones while pumping less money into marketing			2
@entity22 further pinned the quarter 's success on sales of its flagship smartphone , the @entity37 , and its oversized @entity39 handset			0
research firms underscored the two companies ' divergent financial performance with units shipped			0
" @entity6 shipped almost two times more smartphones and grew nine times faster than @entity0 during the quarter , " said @entity45 executive director @entity44 in a report digging into the first quarter			1
another research firm , @entity51 , estimates @entity6 shipped 68 million smartphones during the first quarter , accounting for approximately 34 % of the 200 million smartphones sold			0
@entity0 in contrast , sold north of 37 million iphones during the same quarter			0
the quarter met with the guidance @entity6 had earlier provided , but it was all the more impressive because the company pulled it off despite being forced to pay out an estimated $ 600 million to @entity0 , and even before it dropped its next - generation smartphone , the @entity58 , ( which just went on sale in the @entity18 over the weekend )			1
the @entity58 is expected to keep the @entity6 streak going , and one would think ought to light a fire beneath @entity0			1
@entity0 has stubbornly resisted offering a lower - priced @entity62 , or a handset with a significantly larger screen - size ( older , discounted models do n't count as a true lower price effort )			2
in the tablet space it has been more willing to experiment , and has had great success with its smaller , and lower priced @entity69			0
but with @entity6 on a roll , and showing no signs of letting up on its variety of offerings , @entity0 may be forced to rethink its strategy			1
the pressure will be on for @entity0 to come up with its own plan to expand into new markets , and beyond the premium category that it has dominated for so long			0
until it does , you can expect the applause for @entity6 to continue .			0

as @entity0 sales dip , @entity6 continues to climb
in first three months of 2013 , @entity0 sales *dipped* for first time in a decade
during same period , @entity6 's sales were up 42 percent
@entity0 has resisted bigger , and *cheaper* phones ; @entity6 makes a variety
