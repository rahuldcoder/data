-- he 's the new @entity2			1
but @entity3 does n't shout , and he did n't exactly jump at the chance to take up the mantle of the famous tv pitchman			1
nine months after the ubiquitous king of direct - response tv commercials was found dead in his @entity11 home at age 50 , @entity7 has announced that @entity3 will take @entity2 ' place as product spokesman			1
when @entity7 initially approached him with the idea , @entity3 , 41 , was hesitant at first			2
" they came to me and said , ' you guys were great friends ' -- so it was tough			0
" after @entity2 ' family signed on to the idea , " it came down to a question of , if i did n't do it , who else was going to do it ? " for those who have n't watched any tv in the past decade , the phrase " hi , @entity2 here for @entity29 ! " made him a household name			1
@entity2 was the " bearded , lovable rogue , " said @entity3			1
@entity2 built a trademark with his shouting style and blue shirt and khaki pants			2
@entity3 was the mastermind behind those ads , acting as director and producer after competing against @entity2 for years in the cutthroat world of tv pitchmen			1
to his credit , @entity3 -- like @entity2 -- has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of products -- many of them you 've likely seen on tv			1
but before @entity3 moved countless @entity50 , @entity51 , one sweeps and @entity53 -- his first tv sales pitch almost happened by mistake			1
in 1993 , @entity3 stopped by the cable shopping channel @entity57 to sell a product called the @entity59			1
at first , while chatting informally with a show host about the mops , @entity3 was unaware that the robotic cameras were trained on him			2
" are we on ? " he asked , already realizing the answer to his question			0
" i just sort of froze for half a second , and i thought sh -- , i just got ta pitch			0
" nine minutes later , the phone lines exploded			0
after 22 minutes , @entity3 had sold 5,000 @entity70			2
not bad for his first time at bat			0
eventually , @entity2 also joined @entity57 and the two men " lit up that network " for the next six years , said @entity3			1
different styles the two pitchmen wield very different styles			0
as @entity3 describes it , @entity2 ' secret weapon was himself and his bearded pitchman character to grab viewers ' attention			1
@entity3 , on the other hand , mesmerizes viewers with his southwestern @entity85 accent			1
he describes his style as honing in on viewers and focusing on the benefits of the product			0
before earning @entity91 citizenship , a younger @entity3 cut his teeth in the @entity85 street markets of @entity94 , drawn to the fast - talking @entity95 who were as much entertainers as they were hucksters and pitchers			1
" i was always amazed			0
" the @entity94 pitchmen -- following a centuries - old tradition in places like @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 -- knew they 'd won over a crowd when they 'd see a husband nudge a wife acknowledging they 'd been entertained			2
" they 'd say , ' you know , we watched this guy pitch his heart out and even though we really do n't need what he 's selling , he made us laugh			1
' they 'd give you a 10 - pound tip and take whatever it was we were selling			0
and i really enjoyed that part of the business			0
" @entity3 says street pitching has become a virtual lost art now because of @entity124 and the @entity125			1
" it was just poetic , these pitches , " recalled @entity3 , quoting some of the riffs that still echo across the years			2
' ladies and gentlemen , here 's where we sort the needy from the greedy , the spiers from the buyers , the ones that trust me from the ones that do n't			0
' it was just this poetry -- if you will			0
that 's where poetry meets sales			1
" in the world of tv pitches , poetry meets sales with phrases like , " for zest , it 's the best ! " and " that 's cash in the trash ! " as @entity3 says , the best pitchers demonstrate their products -- and the bigger the demonstration , the better			1
he 's been set on fire and shared a kitchen with a grizzly bear			0
" some pretty crazy stuff			0
" this month @entity3 spent a day being dunked in the @entity11 intercoastal waterway			2
@entity3 went parasailing in a suit wrapped in a product called @entity164 , plunging into the water to demonstrate its absorbency			1
" it was a strange moment , but only @entity2 could have got me there			2
" because of his street market background -- or perhaps in spite of it -- @entity3 admits that some think his sales approach is more sophisticated than @entity2 ' boisterous , bellowing banter			1
" i think we 're both relentless			0
" @entity2 died shortly after he and @entity176 wrapped the first season of @entity180 's reality based tv series @entity181			1
according to a @entity183 , @entity11 , autopsy report issued in august , @entity2 died from a heart attack -- with cocaine listed as a contributing factor			2
choosing to move forward after @entity2 ' death , @entity3 and @entity180 are producing a second season of @entity181 without casting a replacement for @entity2			1
the refreshed program will focus more on inventors who pitch their products to be accepted for a @entity194 ad campaign			0
" i think @entity2 would have slapped me on the side of the head if i did n't continue with it , " said @entity3			1
' life 's a pitch and then you buy it ' @entity2 lives on in thousands of @entity202 videos , where he 's often heard saying , " life 's a pitch and then you buy it			1
" everyone is always selling or buying something , whether they realize it or not , said @entity3			1
" when your child 's applying for college -- it 's no different from pitching			2
you 're pitching yourself , your services , your family			0
you 're selling your house , you 're buying a house			0
everyone is involved in the buying or selling process			0
even if you 're buying -- you 're being sold			0
" how does @entity3 make the sale ? " i think you have to be passionate			2
you have to be sincere			0
you have to really believe in what you sell			0
you have to do it with a smile			0
i often think that if you can make someone laugh while you 're selling -- and disarm them with a little bit of humor -- it goes such a long way			2
" but that 's not all , as the pitchmen often say			0
there 's more to this story			0
lately , @entity2 ' 23 - year - old son , @entity233 , has been working at @entity3 's production company			1
right now , the 23 - year - old musician is n't interested in following his father 's path as a pitchman			0
" he has his father 's soul , but he 's his own man in his own way , " said @entity3			2
even as @entity3 hawks @entity2 ' former brands , the @entity2 family will continue to get a cut of the proceeds from sales			1
" every time i say , ' hi , @entity3 here , ' i always think it should be ' hi , @entity2 here , ' the pitchman confides			1
" but the bottom line is , he 's not here			0
so i 'm honored to be carrying on his legacy a little bit			0

tv pitchman @entity3 replaces the late @entity2 as product spokesman
@entity3 learned to pitch in @entity94 's @entity85 street markets where " poetry meets sales "
no matter who you are , everyone is always selling something , he says
his tips for pitching : be passionate , sincere , smile and use humor
