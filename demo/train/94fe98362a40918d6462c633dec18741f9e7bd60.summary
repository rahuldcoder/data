next tuesday , the @entity1 @entity0 is set to release hundreds more pages of legal opinions detailing the @entity5 's alarming surveillance operations			1
the new release should further anger @entity1 who were already deeply dismayed by the disclosure of an october 2011 @entity9 opinion , which found that the @entity5 had violated the @entity10 and federal law with its surveillance program			1
but we should n't just be upset because the court opinion revealed that the @entity5 has illegally and unconstitutionally collected the emails and other communications of tens of thousands of innocent @entity1			1
we should n't just be upset because the @entity5 could n't convince a secret court that its surveillance was legal			1
and we should n't just be upset because the opinion showed that the government , in the words of the @entity22 court , " frequently and systemically " disregarded the court 's orders			2
what should infuriate every @entity1 — whether you 're a @entity28 or @entity29 , rich or poor , or even whether you are for or against the @entity5 's surveillance program — is the fact that the government hid the @entity22 court 's opinion from the public for years			1
hiding a significant opinion of a federal court , regardless of the topic of the opinion , is inimical to our democracy			0
in the ongoing debate on @entity5 surveillance , there are two separate , but equally important , questions at stake			2
the first part of the debate focuses on the legality of the surveillance : is the @entity5 's surveillance being conducted in accordance with federal laws and the @entity10 ? the second focuses on the democratic legitimacy of the surveillance : have citizens , through their elected officials and through an informed and fair process , approved the laws the government relies on and the actions of the @entity5 ? even setting aside one 's views on the first question , the story behind the @entity22 court opinion provides insight on the second question			1
the answer , quite simply , is " no. " the government has intentionally kept the public in the dark for years			0
for the past year , the @entity73 , where i work , has been fighting the government in federal court for the public release of the @entity22 court 's opinion			1
we sued the @entity0 in august 2012 after the government refused to disclose it			0
initially , we sought the opinion to contribute to a full , informed public debate on the reauthorization of the @entity85 , the expansive federal law the @entity5 relies on to conduct its domestic surveillance operations			1
the law was scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 , and , in the summer and fall of 2012 , @entity88 was debating whether the law should be renewed and if reforms should be introduced			0
but , during that debate , the government repeatedly delayed publicly disclosing anything about the opinion or the government 's surveillance			1
months went by , the debate on the @entity85 came and went , and , on december 30 , 2012 , the law was reauthorized for another four years			0
on january 4 , 2013 , four days after the reauthorization was signed into law , the government finally produced records in response to our lawsuit			0
here 's an example of what they gave us			0
now , eight months later — and only after @entity73 won the first known motion by a private party in the secret @entity22 court ; only after the most significant leak of surveillance information in @entity1 history ; and only after a federal court ordered the government to finalize its declassification decisions and release the opinion — the government finally relented			1
when current and former administration officials like gen. @entity126 take to the airwaves or editorial pages to rebut the " [ b ] reathless claims " about @entity5 spying with condescending offers to help " citizens understand a few basics of what exactly is being done , " know this -- advocates and organizations like the @entity73 have been fighting for a " few basics " about @entity5 surveillance practices for years			1
but government officials , like @entity126 , have refused at every step in the process to provide those facts			0
and , as is now apparent , it 's not just the public that was denied information , members of @entity88 and the judiciary have been misled or kept in the dark about many aspects of the @entity5 's surveillance as well			1
now is the time to change this			0
the executive branch , intelligence agencies and the @entity5 in particular have lost the right to stonewall the public about their activities			1
they have lost the right to treat us condescendingly			0
and it 's far too late in the day to selectively provide a " few basics " about the government 's surveillance			2
we need all the facts , and we need them now			0
in the 1970s , after the @entity162 and multiple reports that federal agencies had spied on @entity1 , @entity88 created a special investigatory commission , the @entity165 , to investigate			2
through public hearings and investigations , the @entity165 ultimately produced a series of reports providing the most thorough investigation of @entity1 intelligence agencies in our nation 's history			2
many of the @entity165 's recommendations were adopted and resulted in a host of beneficial reforms to federal law			0
it 's now apparent that we need a second @entity165 to fully and independently investigate the full scope of the @entity5 's surveillance practices and to recommend meaningful reforms			1
@entity73 , along with 100 other organizations and more than 500,000 individuals , have joined together to call on @entity88 to initiate a full , and public , investigation of the government 's intelligence practices			2
and i hope @entity126 will join us , too			0
his recent op - ed remarked that the debate on @entity5 surveillance would be enhanced if " discussion were based on fact rather than contaminated by inaccuracies and posturing			0
" i could n't agree more			0
we have been lied to , misled and kept in the dark for too long : it 's time we the people command the full story on @entity5 surveillance .			2

a secret court opinion found that the @entity5 had violated @entity1 ' rights
@entity204 : it 's outrageous that government hid the opinion from the public
he says the @entity5 must not stonewall the public about their activities *anymore*
@entity215 : we need to investigate the full scope of @entity5 's surveillance practices
