one week ago , @entity0 stood tall as part of his high school 's homecoming court , spurring his fellow students to cheer			1
on friday , he brought them to tears			2
there 's a jarring disparity between the celebratory scene on the sidelines of @entity12 's football field and the horrific , later one inside the @entity16 state school 's cafeteria			1
@entity0 was center of attention both times : first as one of his school 's most popular students , then as a student who eyewitnesses said shot his peers , killing one of them , before turning his gun on himself			1
as classmate @entity30 , among others , said : " nobody would have expected it from him			1
" 2 dead , including gunman , in school shooting for some , high school can be a hard place to be widely embraced			1
but not for @entity0 , according to students there			1
the scene at halftime of @entity12 's october 17 football game with @entity41 is testament			0
there stood @entity0 , looking dapper in a tie , vest and sneakers , with his long hair tied up tightly			1
a schoolmate noted @entity0 played football and planned to try out soon for wrestling ; then people in the stands applauded him , with enthusiastic whistles and yells of admiration thrown in for good measure			1
the occasion was @entity0 being named the freshmen 's " @entity57 , " joining others in @entity12 's royal court			1
friend and fellow student @entity61 explained that this honor means " a lot of people had good hopes for him and thought the best of him			1
" " that ( title ) means ... teachers like you			0
your peers like you , " said @entity72 , another freshman			0
" you 're a person that everyone likes and a good person			1
" all those applied to @entity0 , according to @entity72			1
" he was a people person , " she said			2
" ... he was just a really nice kid and all - around good person			1
" an avid outdoorsman @entity0 was more than a beloved student or talented athlete			1
he was a proud @entity82			0
according to his social media accounts , he belonged to the @entity85 tribe , which runs a resort casino in @entity87 , a city of 60,000 located 30 miles north of @entity88			0
a fellow tribe member and local @entity91 coach told @entity93 affiliate @entity92 that the teenager was not only " very nice , " but ambitious -- such that he might have one day become a tribal leader			2
@entity0 was an avid outdoorsman who liked to go hunting and had guns			1
just three months ago , he posted a picture to @entity99 of himself holding a rifle , along with the words : " probably the best @entity102 present ever ! i just love my parents ! ! ! " schoolmates and his social media accounts suggest that all was not happy with @entity0 , especially soon before the shooting			1
@entity106 said that , a few weeks ago , @entity0 got into a fight with someone who " said something racist to him			1
" @entity61 elaborated " there was bullying involved and a couple words said towards him that he obviously did n't like , " noting that @entity0 got suspended after the fight			1
a federal law enforcement source also said he 'd been suspended			2
that 's not to say , as @entity61 and others stressed , that this altercation necessarily had anything to do with what happened friday			0
police have not formally identified the attacker			0
looking to social media for possible clues other potential clues might lie in @entity0 's @entity125 feed , which hints at a breakup with a girlfriend in recent months			2
it also includes a post from tuesday saying , " it breaks me ... it actually does ... i know it seems like i 'm sweating it off ... but i 'm not			0
. and i never will be able to			0
" his final @entity125 , on thursday , was much shorter : " it wo n't last ...			0
it 'll never last ...			0
" that same day , @entity106 said he talked to @entity134 at football practice " and he was all fine			0
" and @entity61 chatted with him even more recently , on friday morning , asking @entity0 how he was doing and offering him his ear whenever needed			2
" and he said , ' ok , thank you , ' " @entity61 said			0
" we did a little handshake , and he was off			0
he looked pretty content with life			0
" all these impressions , all these interactions made what happened later that morning in @entity12 cafeteria more shocking			0
@entity72 was there when @entity0 apparently went up to a spot a few tables away and fired his gun			2
when she heard more shots , she turned around and " saw him standing there ... the gun in his hand			0
" " when i saw him , i was like , ' @entity155 , that 's @entity0 , ' " she said			2
" i would have never expected it would have been him , out of all people			2
" it was really heartbreaking for me to see that			0

@entity0 shot 5 , killing 1 , at his @entity16 high school before killing himself
fellow students express *surprise* , describing him as a well - liked and good person
he was suspended after a fight , after " racist " words were directed at him , student says
" i would have never expected it would have been him , " another classmate says
