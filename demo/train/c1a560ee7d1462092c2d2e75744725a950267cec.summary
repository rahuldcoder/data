but even if they need the money , they also enjoy the work , " said @entity55 , president of @entity56 , a nonprofit that helps low - income workers ages 55 and older acquire new job skills			0

usually the vast quantity is on night shift more than [ my daytime shift ] , but still i 'm involved in those , " @entity80 said			0
nineteen years later and still in good shape , he has no plans to stop			0
he likes the pay but he does n't have to work : his wife of 53 years has a pension			2
he could be doing other things , such as playing racquetball and motorcycling with friends , but because he gets four days off after working five roughly 11 - hour days , he already has time for that			0

@entity128 , a former mill worker , also was hired in 1998 to be a dining room hostess at one of the restaurants			0
she works 20 hours a week ; her husband works about 30			1
they each said they enjoy the work and the people they 've met			0
they do n't have to work for the money , they said , but the pay does n't hurt			2
" it 's nice to have your own money , because when i want to go shopping , i do n't have to ask nobody , " @entity128 said , laughing			1
experience works says many low - income workers 55 and older need to find jobs but ca n't , in part because of the recession			1
it points to the age group 's unemployment rate : it was 6.8 percent in august , up from 2.9 percent three years earlier , according to the @entity172			2
that 's still better than the rate for all age groups , 9.7 percent in august			2
