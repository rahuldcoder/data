@entity0 has long made it known that he plans to campaign for a second term in the @entity4 , but questions have emerged over whether he can run for his seat and for the @entity36 at the same time			1
@entity18 law prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot for two different offices			0
attempts to change the law were made last year in the @entity17 - controlled @entity4 but stalled in the @entity43 - controlled @entity42			0
attempts by @entity17 to retake control of the state house in last week 's elections were unsuccessful , meaning the law will likely stay in the books for 2016			2
some of @entity0 's supporters have argued the law could be challenged , while others say there are ways he can get around it so that his name wo n't appear on the ballot twice			1
