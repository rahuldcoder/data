@entity3 had panda baby watch			0
now @entity5 has stinky flower watch			1
the enormous plant known as the corpse flower is expected to bloom and stink up the grounds at the @entity10 sometime this week			1
it will be the first flowering of this titan arum ( amorphophallus titanum ) , also known as the stinky plant , which has lived at the garden since 2007			1
the plant does n't have an annual blooming cycle ; it can wait years or even decades between cycles			1
it 's expected to heat up , start smelling like dead animals and bloom overnight or in the early morning hours -- though exactly which night it will happen is not known			1
the heat and smell is to attract pollinator insects such as dung beetles in its natural habitat , said @entity29 , the garden 's public programs manager			0
the garden does n't have any such beetles but resident flies could come calling , he said			0
@entity34 escapes cheetahs by leaping into tourists ' suv once the garden confirmed on monday , july 8 , that the plant was going to bloom , staffers moved quickly to display it publicly on july 11			2
a native of @entity44 , @entity45 , this particular plant is part of the garden 's collection of 14 corpse flowers			1
they are rarely put on display because they require a lot of heat and humidity , which is why they are grown at the garden 's production greenhouses in @entity59 @entity5 -- rarely open to the public			0
now the star of the garden , the plant is growing quickly			0
it was 52 inches tall when it was put on display on july 11			0
by saturday morning , it measured 62 inches high and 69 inches by sunday night			0
tuesday morning , it was 79 inches tall			0
once completely open , it can stay in bloom for 24 to 48 hours , and then it will collapse quickly			2
the @entity71 last displayed a blooming titan arum in 2007			1
at least seven @entity71 institutions have at least one titan arum in each of its collections			1
the garden will have extended hours from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on tuesday and wednesday			0
if you ca n't make it to the nation 's capital watch it open up online on the garden 's live flower cam			2
the @entity84 of @entity85 saw its oldest corpse flower bloom last week , attracting about 4,000 visitors over three days , said garden spokesman @entity88			1
it previously bloomed in 2008 and 2011			0
the garden has another four plants in its greenhouses , but @entity88 said they are still too young to bloom .			2

a corpse flower at the @entity71 will bloom for the first time ever
native to the *rainforests* of @entity44 , @entity45 , they take years to bloom
when they start blooming , they get very hot and stinky
