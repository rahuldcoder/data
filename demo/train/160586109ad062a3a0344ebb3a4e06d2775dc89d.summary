on wednesday , the @entity0 will have the opportunity to put a stop to one of the most expensive @entity5 rules in history : the @entity7 and @entity9 rule			1
this is the centerpiece of president @entity12 's war on coal			1
called @entity15 , or @entity16 , this rule will destroy jobs and cause energy prices to skyrocket			0
by voting for my resolution , @entity22 37 , members of the @entity0 can prevent the @entity12 @entity5 from inflicting so much economic pain on @entity25 families			1
how do we know that @entity16 is designed to kill coal ? just ask @entity29 administrator @entity28 , who was seen on video admitting that because of the @entity5 's regulatory barrage , " if you want to build a coal plant you got a big problem			2
" he went on to say that @entity5 's decision to kill coal was " painful every step of the way , " because " if you go to @entity39 , @entity40 , and all those places , you have coal communities who depend on coal			2
" well , those communities that depend on coal are feeling that pain , and that 's why bipartisan momentum is growing for my resolution			2
@entity39 's gov. @entity52 , a @entity53 , recently wrote to @entity39 sens. @entity54 and @entity55 urging them to vote for @entity22 37 , saying @entity5 's rules have " coalesced to create an unprecedented attack on @entity39 's coal industry			1
" @entity39 's lt. gov. @entity60 echoed this concern , saying that @entity5 is destroying the state 's " most valuable state natural resource and industry			2
" @entity65 , too , has come out to stop the job - killing over-regulation			0
@entity73 , president of the @entity74 , one of the biggest labor unions in the country , recently sent a letter to several senators asking them to support my resolution because of " the threat that the @entity15 rule poses to @entity74 members ' jobs , the economies of coal field communities , and the future direction of our national energy policy			1
" in addition , we 've also secured the support of the @entity87 , the @entity88 , the @entity89 and the @entity90 , all of which represent major groups who are apparently not " doing fine " in the face of @entity5 's regulations			1
let me be clear that this campaign to destroy coal is not about public health			0
if it were , @entity99 would not have voted against my @entity101 bill back in 2005 , a bill that would have achieved a reduction in mercury emissions of 70 % by 2018			2
in fact , at that time , then - sen. @entity12 served with me on the @entity106			2
as he explained , " i voted against the @entity101 bill			0
in fact , i was the deciding vote			0
" there is a crucial difference between @entity101 and @entity16			0
@entity101 would have reduced emissions without harming jobs and our economy because it was based on a common - sense , market - based approach , designed to retain coal as a generator of electricity while reducing emissions each year			0
on the other hand , @entity16 is designed to kill coal as well as all the good paying jobs that come with it , while providing little -- if any -- environmental gain			0
just before president @entity12 felt compelled to halt @entity5 's plan to tighten the ozone standard after significant push - back from @entity131 , then - @entity127 chief of staff @entity126 asked , " what are the health impacts of unemployment ? " that is one of the most important questions before the @entity0 in preparation for the vote to stop @entity16			1
what are the health impacts on children whose parents will lose their jobs because of president @entity12 's war on coal ? what are the health impacts on children in low - income families whose parents will have to spend more for skyrocketing electricity costs and less on their kids ' well - being ? the good news is that @entity131 can halt president @entity12 's senseless war on fossil fuels and affordable energy			1
many of my @entity159 colleagues have gone on record saying they want to rein in this agency			0
@entity164 sen. @entity163 is one of them ; she told @entity166 that she is determined to " hold the line on the @entity5			0
" does that mean she , and other @entity99 who have made similar statements , will vote to stop the centerpiece of @entity12 's war on coal ? i believe the @entity5 should go back to the drawing board and draft a rule targeted at mercury that would balance economic growth with environmental gain			1
the vote on my resolution will clearly demonstrate to the @entity25 people which senators will " hold the line " and stand with their constituents for jobs and affordable energy , and which senators will stand with president @entity12 and his global warming agenda that will be painful -- " every step of the way " -- for their constituents			1
