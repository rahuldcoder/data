-- did @entity1 really shape up @entity3 's unhealthiest city ? a spokeswoman for @entity5 , @entity6 -- the city @entity1 singled out as one of the unhealthiest places in @entity3 -- says local residents are exercising and eating better			1
but she 's not giving much credit to the cheeky @entity14 chef and nutrition activist			2
" what people need to realize is there was already a movement to make @entity5 healthier , " says @entity15 , whose @entity6 hometown plays a starring role in @entity1 's new macro-makeover show " @entity20 , " set to debut on @entity19 on sunday			1
@entity5 first made its way into the national consciousness in 2008 , when @entity28 named it " @entity3 's fattest city , " citing unmatched rates of obesity , heart disease and diabetes , and rates of toothlessness among older residents			1
the @entity38 , in a morbidity and mortality report released in february , said that 32.9 percent of the populace surveyed in an area that included @entity5 and nearby @entity43 , @entity44 , is obese			2
@entity45 disputes those findings , saying the survey covered a broad tri-state area surrounding her college town			0
" people think we 're all morbidly obese , walking around eating pizza , " she grumbles			0
" we have @entity55 every weekend			0
when the production crew came here , i was like ' we have our teeth			0
we have master 's degrees			0
' " not everyone is so tough on the celebrity chef			1
@entity61 , a tv reviewer for the @entity62 , says the show does n't portray @entity5 badly			2
actually , she says , " @entity1 is very complimentary of @entity5 and its people throughout the entire hour -- even when they give him a hard time			1
" @entity67 says " no one cuts him any slack " when @entity5 residents learn about disparaging comments the @entity1 made about them to @entity14 press			1
" i personally think it 's the best moment of the show , " @entity67 says			0
@entity1 and his crew descended on @entity5 in the fall of 2009 with the admittedly ambitious goal of redefining its residents ' relationship with food			1
his team spent five months consulting with cafeteria workers , coaching veggie - averse schoolchildren and opening up a community kitchen serving wholesome meals			0
" the health statistics here are some of the most crippling and scary in the world , " @entity1 says in a show promo , calling @entity5 " a dark place			1
" @entity1 took on @entity5 after successfully reforming the school meal system in the @entity14			1
in the @entity14 , @entity1 spearheaded a healthy school lunch campaign that persuaded the government there to allocate more than $ 400 million for the lunches			2
if the trailer can be trusted , he apparently assumed his résumé entitled him to a hero 's welcome and was stunned to discover skeptics who did n't share his revulsion to processed chicken nuggets			0
@entity1 burst into tears after a hostile interview with a radio host who said , " we do n't want to sit around and eat lettuce all day			2
" the trailer then cuts to a weeping @entity1 : " they do n't understand me , " he says , " they do n't know why i 'm here			0
" to the contrary , @entity15 says , the city of @entity5 already had anti-obesity programs in place when @entity1 showed up			2
his presence only served to " further the mission " by making healthy habits a popular conversation topic			0
" we are creating a committee to evaluate how we can implement some of @entity1 's suggestions , " she adds diplomatically			1
@entity15 suspects the lasting result of @entity1 's extended stay might not be trimmer waistlines , but fattened city coffers			1
" i firmly believe anything that puts us on the national forefront is good , " she says			0
" we 're applying for a @entity131 program right now , and maybe this will help			0
