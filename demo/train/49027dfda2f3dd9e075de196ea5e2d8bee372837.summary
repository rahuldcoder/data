" but @entity13 spokesperson @entity29 told reporters shortly afterward the website overhaul is " on track " for the site to be working smoothly for the " vast majority " of consumers by the deadline			2
the website is the primary federal portal for people to sign up for health insurance under the @entity9 , or @entity9			1
some states have separate web - based systems for consumers to register as well			0
capacity , enrollment fall short since it 's troubled launch on october 1 when it could not perform the basic functions it was envisioned to do , @entity23 said @entity6 has increased capacity and is now able to handle up to 25,000 users on the site per hour			1
additionally , 17,000 are able to register on the website each hour			2
although improved , it is still far short of the administration 's goal of increasing capacity to at least 50,000 people per hour			2
@entity9 promises : where things stand on signing up , only 26,794 people have completed the enrollment process for health care coverage through the federal insurance marketplace , including @entity6 , health secretary @entity62 told reporters on a conference call			1
in addition , 79,391 have enrolled for coverage through separate state - based exchanges			2
@entity9 's first month : 106,000 signed up map : enrollment numbers the government reported that nearly 27 million unique users have visited either @entity6 or state exchange sites since enrollment began on october 1 â€” 19.5 million of those to the federal site			1
@entity79 is one of several government it officers who testified at the 4 1/2 - hour oversight hearing			2
in the first hour , both @entity79 and @entity83 , deputy chief information officer for the @entity84 , called the problems with the website " unacceptable			1
" at times , the question - and - answer session before the @entity90 - led panel became contentious , not only between witnesses and members of @entity3 but also between lawmakers			0
@entity93 have accused @entity19 of over-politicizing the issue			1
one testy exchange involved @entity19 and @entity96 rep. @entity96 , who likened the hearing to a kangaroo court			1
" this is not a partisan hearing			2
i will not have it accused of a partisan hearing , " @entity19 said			1
@entity96 then said , " this is a hearing on a broken website by a broken committee			1
" during his opening statement , @entity19 said @entity6 " was n't a small mistake			1
" he said it went " live and effectively exploded on the launch pad			1
" " the president should have known , " @entity19 added , " they were n't ready			1
they were n't close to ready			0
" rep. @entity113 , @entity114 , demonstrated the website 's continuing problems by holding up his @entity117 and saying he had been trying to use the site for about an 90 minutes			2
but when he hit the " create account " button , it did n't take him to the next screen			0
the button " just changes colors			0
" the top @entity96 on the committee , rep. @entity125 , @entity126 , said in his opening statement that the hearing is motivated by politics and @entity90 have no intention of working on a solution to ensure the @entity9 is successful			1
" for the past three years , the @entity138 priority has been to bring down this law , " @entity125 said , referencing the recent government shutdown and repeated attempts by @entity90 in the @entity13 to repeal or defund the measure approved without @entity90 support in 2010			1
@entity79 was subpoenaed politics around the hearing had reached fever pitch on tuesday			1
@entity79 was subpoenaed last week by @entity19 , after the @entity13 balked at a request for his voluntary immediate appearance because he is leading the team working feverishly to fulfill a promise that by the end of the month problems will be eliminated on @entity6			1
@entity19 insisted @entity79 appear immediately to explain why the website was n't ready when it was launched to adequately handle inquiries and enrollment			1
the @entity13 decided at the last minute to allow him to testify			0
the site 's problems have been a major early policy and political setback for @entity2 on this issue , but the administration says it is working aggressively to fix it and should have it working smoothly for most people by month 's end			2
meanwhile , former treasury secretary @entity162 , who served as an economic adviser to @entity2 , said the president has not been adequately served by his staff in the implementation of the @entity9			0
" he was not well served by his colleagues in the administration , " @entity162 said on @entity168 's " @entity167			0
" " the @entity173 people were not well served by the way in which this played out			2
" @entity13 officials get earful from @entity13 @entity93 @entity162 wrote a memo to the president in 2010 suggesting that @entity6 was not something the government could handle and he needed to bring in experts			1
while @entity162 would not provide details about internal discussions , he said tuesday , " you need experts			0
you need to trust but you need to verify			0
you ca n't go rushing the schedule when you get behind or you end up making more errors			0
" security security of personal and financial information was also a topic of concern to committee members			0
@entity83 admitted security aspects had not been tested " thoroughly			0
" the admission came when rep. @entity197 , @entity198 , a former owner of web consulting business , paraphrased @entity83 's previous statement about security testing , indicating that @entity83 said security testing had been conducted " thoroughly			0
" @entity83 jumped in and said " if i said ' thoroughly , ' i apologize			0
" @entity203 , director , information technology management issues at the nonpartisan @entity205 , said security testing was done early on an incomplete system			0
@entity203 noted however , that he did have access to testing record after mid-september			0
" the fundamental question is what is being done now and is that adequate to date , " he said			0
using his knowledge of web development , @entity197 said @entity6 's design to access information from the @entity217 and @entity216 is a " target for hackers			2
" official : hackers tried repeatedly to attack @entity9 website but @entity83 assured the committee that consumers would be notified if their credit card information has been compromised , adding that " several laws and rules apply " that the government is required to follow			0
cost of @entity6 at the hearing , the administration technology officials were stymied by the question : " how much all this is going to cost us to straighten this out ? " they had no answer			1
one said they were " blind to that			0
" the actual figure of money in the pipeline to last for development and early implementation of the website is north of $ 630 million			0
@entity90 rips early @entity9 enrollment figures can @entity3 really save insurance plans lost under @entity9 ? many in @entity3 avoiding @entity9 exchanges			0
