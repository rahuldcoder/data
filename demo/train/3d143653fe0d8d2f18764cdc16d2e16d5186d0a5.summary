-- @entity1 crossed the line first in the 66th @entity4 @entity3 to @entity6 yacht race on tuesday , but the @entity9 super maxi 's fifth victory in the annual event is in doubt due to an official protest			1
@entity1 and @entity15 entry @entity13 were both reported by the race committee a few hours earlier after breaking safety rules by failing to make radio contact , and a hearing will be held on wednesday			1
" both have reported only by telephone , which does not comply , so the protests were lodged at 5.05 p.m. today , " committee chairman @entity20 said			1
the rules are in place after six people died when severe weather conditions hit the 1998 race , sinking five yachts and forcing a record 66 to retire			1
official race website " this is a fundamental safety issue , " @entity20 said			2
" should a situation occur , we can not organize search and rescue operations via telephones			2
i consider this a serious breach			2
" the 100 - foot @entity1 , skippered by @entity9 @entity39 , sailed into the @entity41 capital two days , seven hours , 37 minutes and 20 seconds after leaving @entity42 , having led most of the way			1
" a few people got their facts mixed up , " @entity44 said			0
" we 've got some of the most accredited yachtsmen and women on this boat			0
we 've won numerous world championships			0
we 've dealt with juries all our lives and we 're very confident we did everything by the book			0
there is no way that as skipper i would have left @entity61 [ on the south coast of @entity63 ] without knowing we were 100 % compliant with the rules			1
" weather batters @entity3 - @entity6 race fleet @entity1 finished second last year , breaking a run of four successive victories			1
but this time @entity44 and crew safely negotiated gale - force conditions which led to 16 boats retiring to finish well ahead of their rivals , completing their journey up the @entity75 at 8:37 p.m. local time ( 0937 gmt. ) second - placed @entity77 finished almost four hours later , having been becalmed in sight of the docks			1
its skipper @entity80 reported that his boat -- crewed by sports stars including former cricketer @entity83 , rugby players @entity84 and @entity86 plus surfing world champion @entity87 and swimmer @entity88 -- had experienced several problems			2
" the damage we sustained was to the reef lines earlier and some tack lines on the headsail which , running without a headsail , put us an hour back			0
also , a fuel tank broke lose			0
these tanks carry so much fuel that you 've got a quarter of a ton to manhandle , which is difficult , " he said on tuesday			0
" we did n't realize that we had a substantial leak in the bow and carried on with a ton and a half of water , which we only detected this morning			0
we have a watertight bulkhead up there and when we opened it , water came pouring out			0
" @entity113 's @entity112 crossed the line in third , an improvement on last year 's eighth placing			0
@entity13 , skippered by @entity118 and one of the pre-race favorites for line honors , had yet to finish .			1
