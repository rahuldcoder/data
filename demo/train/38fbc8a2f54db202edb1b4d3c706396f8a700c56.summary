-- a day after world no. 1 @entity2 suffered one of the worst losses of her career at the @entity7 finals , second - ranked @entity1 was n't that much better			1
@entity1 's hopes of reaching the semifinals in @entity10 -- not to mention overtaking @entity2 as the year - end no. 1 -- are hanging by a thread following a 6 - 3 6 - 2 defeat to @entity14 on thursday			1
but @entity2 rebounded in thursday 's last match by crushing an out of sorts @entity18 6 - 1 6 - 1			1
@entity14 famously beat @entity1 at @entity19 in 2011 to open her grand slam account but the @entity21 had lost five in a row to the @entity24 - based @entity23			2
@entity1 hit six double faults and was broken five times as she fell to 0 - 2 in the @entity27			2
never one for excuses , she refused to blame the result on fatigue two days after @entity31 outlasted her in a grueling three - hour contest			2
" i do n't feel tired , " @entity1 told reporters			0
" i 'm happy to be here			0
i 'm happy to be part of this event			0
" it 's easy to sit here and say , ' yeah , i 'm tired			0
' but that 's not the way i feel or the way that i choose to speak			0
" @entity14 improved to 1 - 1 while the resurgent @entity31 remained a perfect 2 - 0 after earlier topping @entity42 7 - 5 6 - 3			1
@entity1 -- who won her lone year - end title 10 years ago -- must now beat the 1 - 1 @entity42 on friday to have any chance of advancing			1
but even a win wo n't guarantee a spot in the semifinals			0
for @entity1 to become the year - end no. 1 , she now has to win the tournament and hope @entity2 does n't make the final			1
" i still have a match ahead of me , and i will do my best to finish it on a good note , " @entity1 said			2
" that 's the only thing i can ask of myself			0
" @entity55 routed @entity2 6 - 0 6 - 2 in the @entity56 on wednesday , prompting the 18 - time grand slam winner to say she was " embarrassed " with her performance			1
she was far better versus a @entity18 who has done little since reaching the @entity19 final			2
" yesterday was tough for me but i had to put it behind me , " @entity2 was quoted as saying by the @entity7			0
" my coach really helped me out and to focus on today , telling me that i 'm still in the tournament , even though i felt like i was out of it after such a tough loss			0
" @entity18 escaped a 0 - 40 hole on serve in the first game but then lost 11 consecutive games to trail 6 - 1 5 - 0			1
the @entity69 finished with an 0 - 3 record and did n't claim a set			0
if @entity72 does n't beat @entity55 -- who has already qualified for the semifinals -- in straight sets friday , @entity2 and @entity55 progress to the last four .			1

@entity1 loses to @entity14 in straight sets at the @entity77
@entity1 needs to win her final group match to have any chance of progressing
@entity2 *recovers* from a bad defeat wednesday to crush @entity18
@entity31 improves to 2 - 0 after *downing* @entity42 in straight sets
