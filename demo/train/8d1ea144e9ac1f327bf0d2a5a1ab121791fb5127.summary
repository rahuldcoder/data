@entity1 , @entity2 they are sleek , mostly silent converted weapons of war : drones used by the @entity8 to scan the skies in the empty deserts of the @entity11 to spot illegal immigrants and then , if things work out , have agents arrest them			1
that 's the idea , and the agents who use them say the drones give them a vantage point they never had before			2
@entity3 was inside the control room in @entity20 , @entity2 , during a recent mission , when a control team inside a virtual cockpit operated the drones			2
opinion : can @entity27 drone policy finally soar ? flying at 18,000 feet , the drones view the landscape below , lock onto potential suspects crossing the @entity2 desert , and agents on the ground move into make the arrests			1
but it 's outrageously expensive : $ 28,000 for a single arrest			0
that figure comes from doing the math , derived from the most recent inspector general report on the use of drones for the @entity43			1
the report found that operating nine drones in 2013 cost taxpayers $ 62.5 million			1
those same nine drones are credited with apprehending just 2,272 suspects , or less than 2 % of the total arrests by @entity49 in the area the drones operate			2

in its first eight years of operations , the @entity57 drone program has cost $ 360 million			0
the drones are exactly like the ones used by the military in operations across @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and other battle zone countries , except there are no missiles on board			0
but the sophisticated equipment is also temperamental			0
the drones are sensitive to weather			0
they 're also grounded about 80 % of the time because of budget issues , according to the inspector general			0
the report also says the drones only patrol 170 miles of the 1,993 mile border			1
drone carrying drugs crashes south of @entity27 border maj. gen. @entity83 , assistant commissioner of @entity49 , runs the program , and hey says while the program needs improvements , it 's a mistake to only view the drones ' success in terms of arrests			1
he says the drones give them a big picture of the border , what he calls " domain awareness			1
" " we could never see the border in the same way we could before we got these ... " adding the information received by the drones is invaluable to agents on the ground			1
alles also says in 2013 , the arrests by drone brought in $ 66,000 per hour of contraband seizures			0
inspector general @entity107 says while the drones do contribute to overall border security , @entity49 has n't " put any measurements in place as to whether it 's effective ; the measurements we saw show that in fact it 's not effective			1
" @entity83 says he does n't want any more drones until he can prove the program works at every level			2
then , perhaps , he will be comfortable with acquiring more of them			0
but there are longterm plans circulating from @entity122 and @entity123 supporters of the drones to buy more and have them constantly in the air .			0
