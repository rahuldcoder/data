@entity1 / @entity0 , @entity2 -- one moment , @entity4 was standing on his big stage			1
the next moment , he was being plowed under it			0
there was a small crater in the turf where the 314 - pound @entity4 tried to dig in his cleats and stop the charge of @entity12 , a 359 - pound defensive tackle from the @entity13			1
@entity4 is an offensive lineman from @entity14 , an outpost in northwest @entity16 , and @entity17 scouts were gathered around to see if the player from a small @entity21 school could block a player from a @entity23 of college football , a school from the mighty @entity25			1
@entity12 thrust his powerful claws straight into @entity4 's chest and it was an instant mismatch			2
@entity29 beat little , for the moment			0
it was a one - on - one drill at a practice for the @entity33 , a college football all - star game , which is the next step in the 2013 @entity17 draft process			1
@entity4 was shoved back by @entity12 and left standing on a white towel , which was the imaginary quarterback @entity4 was supposed to protect			2
this would have been a sack in a real game , the quarterback in a heap at the feet of @entity12 , and @entity4 humiliated			1
@entity4 , a small - college nobody , did not pick up that white towel and start waving it as a flag of surrender			1
he was n't going to be defined by one stinking play			0
the next snap in the one - on - one drill with @entity12 , @entity4 quick - setted @entity12 , which means he hit him first			1
if the big guy from @entity52 was going to bull rush @entity4 in a drill with a helmet and no pads where coaches want to see players work with their hands , not power , @entity4 would counter with his own shifty move			2
he did n't take a step back to pass protect , he attacked @entity12 with a block			2
" punched him right in the face mask , " said @entity4 , whose long blond hair flowed out of the back of his helmet			2
" i 'm small school , he 's big school			1
there might have been a few moments of awe because of the stage we 're on here , being here in front of a lot of scouts , but after that first hit , it 's just football			0
you have to show something here , some competitiveness			0
you do n't let people intimidate you because you are from a small school			1
" @entity12 was with @entity4 on every point			2
" i encourage him and others to come on , let 's go , if they feel they have to make a name for themselves against me , " @entity12 said			0
" i know he 's on the big stage , but i 've got to eat same as he 's got to eat			0
" it was like that all week here at the @entity33 workouts			2
there are 700 @entity17 personnel studying 106 college players up close in advance of the april 25 - 27 draft			1
it is not only @entity103 in the game , but it is big school vs. small school , big name vs. no name			1
they will play the game at 4 p.m. et on saturday , but the skirmishes monday through friday at the practices are the real prize here for scouts and @entity17 draft wonks			1
players like @entity52 's @entity12 are on television throughout the fall			0
they have less of a task getting space on stage at a prestigious game like the @entity33			2
@entity4 , who is 6 - foot - 5 , 314 pounds , has to depend more on the keen eye of scouts			1
a tape of a @entity14 game was sent to @entity129 , the @entity33 executive director , who is responsible for issuing invitations and making sure legitimate @entity17 prospects are in the game			1
@entity129 watched the tape and saw @entity4 keeping his feet during a driving snowstorm on a slick field and still protecting the quarterback			2
@entity138 , a 341 - pound defensive tackle from @entity139 , sent a tape showing him walking on his hands displaying spectacular upper body strength			1
@entity129 invited @entity138 , too			0
it is a little gimmicky , but you do what you have to do			0
the @entity33 is a melting pot of talent			2
@entity148 , an offensive lineman from @entity149 , is playing on the same team as @entity151 , the star quarterback from @entity149 , who is here as a wide receiver / kick returner			1
once here , small school can make plays over big school			1
@entity157 , a cornerback from @entity158 , dashed in front of the @entity52 wide receiver @entity160 to make a one - handed interception			0
" when you make a play like that , you flush it , forget about it , and keep it rolling and show scouts you can do that play after play , " @entity162 said			0
" do n't make one play out here and think it 's enough			0
" @entity162 thought back to his interception and smiled wide			0
" anybody from anywhere can play this game , " he said			0
he 's right about that			0
he is 6 - foot - 8 , 277 pounds and is the former junior world record holder in the discus			0
@entity179 played college football at @entity184 and is turning heads here with " freakish " athletic ability			1
@entity187 is a 6 - foot - 5 , 274 - pound defensive end from @entity188 , by way of @entity190			1
he played college football just 2Â½ seasons and is projected as a high - round pick in the draft			1
there are two scouting services for @entity17 teams , @entity197 and @entity198 , who scour the outposts , those small schools , and file reports for 28 @entity17 teams ( four teams do not subscribe to the services )			1
@entity17 teams have their own scouts who endure plenty of windshield time driving to small schools spread around the country to get a peek at a player			1
when word of a 314 - pound lineman with quick feet spread , @entity17 teams flocked to @entity216 , @entity16 , to see @entity4			1
@entity129 said @entity17 scouts will try to stay mum on a prospect from a small school to keep teams off the scent			1
" i sent a questionnaire out with @entity4 's name on it , along with some other names , and asked whether these players should be invited and all the scouts said yes , yes , yes to the others and no to @entity4 , " said @entity129 , a former scout and general manager			2
" i knew something was up when they all said no. they were trying to sit on him			0
i got some tape , looked at him , and invited him			0
" there are some things that have nothing to do with skill that @entity17 scouts look for in a prospect , be they from big schools or little schools			2
" i like to see if they get along , " said @entity245 , the general manager of the @entity246			0
" it 's an indication that they like to play the game			0
most of the good ones like the whole process , the time in the locker room , and the practices			0
" this game is a lot more than playing saturdays and sundays			0
you look at a guy and you say ' is he a good , old - fashioned country ballplayer , or not ? ' " if @entity129 did his work in selecting these teams -- and most scouts think he did with the help of all his @entity17 contacts -- 90 to 95 of the 106 players at the @entity33 will be drafted in the seven rounds			1
the other 10 to 16 players will be part of " college free agency			0
" they can sign with any team as " undrafted free agents			0
" teams have approximately $ 75,000 in bonus money to use to invite undrafted players to their preseason camps			0
as @entity4 and others will prove , the @entity17 welcome mat is wide and wide open			1
the small - school player can walk through the same door as the big - school player .			2

the @entity33 , a college football game , is a major step in the 2013 @entity17 draft process
all eyes are on @entity4 , offensive lineman from @entity14 in @entity16
@entity288 : @entity17 teams flocked to @entity216 when word spread of a quick 314 - pound lineman
@entity4 : " you do n't let people intimidate you because you are from a small school "
