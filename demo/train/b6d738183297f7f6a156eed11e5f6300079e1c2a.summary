@entity0 , @entity1 -- after six years of a @entity5 administration , including three tumultuous years of a hung parliament , @entity1 voters have returned to a conservative government and majority rule			1
@entity9 , reinstalled as prime minister by his party at the 11th hour , managed to contain the size of the loss , likely to have been a wipeout under former pm @entity15			2
new prime minister @entity16 had a long ministerial career in the former @entity19 government			1
but many questions remain about how he will handle the top job			1
he has been able to cruise into power primarily on @entity5 's infighting plus his promises to scrap the carbon tax , stop the asylum seeker boats and put the budget into better shape			0
@entity16 pledges ' competent , trustworthy ' government he inherits an electorate that is disillusioned with and disengaged from politics , after continuous campaigning since 2010 because the parliament was on a knife edge			1
@entity5 's breaking of its promise not to bring in a carbon tax and the @entity19 's years of negativity have left people jaded and cynical about all politicians			0
@entity16 had a clear ascendancy over @entity15 , but the dynamics suddenly changed when @entity9 - deposed by @entity15 in 2010 - mounted his successful counter-coup in late june			1
with his popularity and some policy changes , @entity9 appeared to put @entity5 in a very competitive			0
perhaps even winning , position			0
but during the five week campaign , the dynamics altered again			0
it became clear @entity9 ( who did n't campaign well ) would not be able to overcome voters ' entrenched scepticism about a government that , despite earlier successfully navigating @entity1 through the global financial crisis and making some worthy policy changes , had become riven with leadership division			1
the campaign was dominated by debate over which side was better to manage the economy ; @entity5 's claims that @entity16 had a $ 70 billion funding hole and would hack into health and education , and the @entity5 's record			1
the media 's coverage became an issue , with @entity9 trenchantly attacking @entity69 , whose empire owns 14 of @entity1 's 21 metro daily and sunday newspapers			1
the @entity69 tabloids were quite feral , with @entity75 's @entity74 beginning the campaign with the headline " @entity79 " and one front page having a mocked up @entity9 and his deputy @entity80 as the bumbling nazis from @entity82			0
the new pm , while a conservative , is likely to be centrist and pragmatic			1
in the @entity86 cabinet he opposed the extreme industrial relations policy , @entity88 , which contributed to that government 's 2007 defeat			0
he has promised to be in the " sensible centre " on industrial relations			0
a committed @entity93 , he is anti-gay marriage ( despite having a gay sister ) but will leave it up to his party room as to whether there should be a conscience vote for @entity99 on any private member 's bill on the subject			0
@entity16 says he will run a '' no surprises '' government			1
he has also promised not to break any election promises			0
this may be an impossible undertaking , but the backlash against @entity15 after she -- under the pressure of minority government -- breached her '' no carbon tax '' pledge has been a lesson to all political leaders			0
in saturday night 's victory speech @entity16 said : '' from today , i declare that @entity1 is under new management and that @entity1 is once more open for business			1
'' the @entity1 economy is growing slightly under trend and unemployment is rising			1
the economy remains strong , but the outlook is uncertain , with much depending on @entity123 and commodity prices			0
the mining investment boom is ending and the challenge now is for @entity1 to manage the transition to increased reliance on other sectors			1
one of @entity16 's main difficulties will be dealing with the parliament 's powerful upper house which , when the new senators take their places in july , will have a diverse collection of independent and micro party crossbenchers determining the fate of legislation			1
on foreign policy , @entity16 is a strong @entity140 alliance man			2
he is also a believer in the " anglosphere , " and was one of the leaders of the monarchist cause when in 1999 @entity1 had its failed republic referendum			2
but @entity16 's focus will be heavily on @entity148			2
he has said policy should emphasize " @entity150 rather than @entity151 " -- a comment not only on the importance to be placed on the region , but also reflecting the @entity19 's lack of faith in multilateralism			0
@entity16 has promised an early visit to @entity150 , where he will try to persuade the reluctant @entity159 to accept his policy of turning back asylum seeker boats			2
opinion : @entity1 parties in ' race to bottom ' on asylum seeker policy during the election campaign @entity16 took a more restrained approach towards a possible strike against @entity171 than did @entity9 , a former foreign minister and diplomat			1
as @entity16 prepare his ministry , @entity5 is grappling with who is to be its new leader			2
favorite , if he decides to put his hand up , is outgoing deputy prime minister @entity80 , with the other contender , outgoing education minister @entity178 saying he will only run as a consensus candidate			0
it wo n't be a great job to have any time soon			0

questions remain about how @entity16 will handle top job , says @entity187
he inherits electorate that is disillusioned with and disengaged from politics , she adds
new pm , while conservative , is likely to be centrist and pragmatic - @entity187
challenge for @entity1 is end reliance on mining sector
