with reports that violence in @entity3 is spreading beyond separatist - controlled areas , it is clear the so - called @entity8 ceasefire between the @entity3 government and @entity11 rebels in the @entity12 is teetering			1
if the @entity14 wants to avoid the prospect of the violence spilling over into a broader conflict , it will need to keep the option of more direct involvement -- including the provision of arms -- firmly on the table			2
until recently , the @entity23 has understandably been focused on countering the rise of the @entity25 , a reality that allowed the @entity27 ( especially @entity28 ) to take the lead in crafting a response to @entity32 's aggression			2
but this @entity14 reluctance to take center stage has allowed the @entity32 to exploit splits within @entity27 in the knowledge that the @entity38 states would not fight force with force			2
that was until serious talk of potential @entity14 lethal military assistance to @entity44 upended the conversation			2
the @entity14 debate over providing arms to @entity3 was sparked in part by a report by a number of former senior officials calling for the @entity14 to provide $ 3 billion in aid , including weapons , to the @entity3 military			1
top administration officials , including new defense secretary @entity56 , then hinted that they favored arming @entity44			0
indeed , following his meeting with @entity28 chancellor @entity59 on february 9 , even president @entity57 noted that he was considering " all options , " presumably including lethal military assistance , should diplomacy fail			0
true , this openness to providing arms left @entity57 at odds with @entity59 and many other @entity27 leaders , who feared it would escalate the conflict			0
but it also increased the pressure on @entity59 and @entity72 president @entity71 to press for a deal to avoid what they feared might be a bigger conflict , fueled by @entity14 weapons			0
the prospect of @entity14 military assistance also no doubt affected the @entity32 calculation			0
as skeptics of the argument for lethal assistance pointed out , even with @entity14 weapons , @entity3 's military would never be able to defeat @entity32 regulars , while @entity88 's ability to arm the separatists would always outstrip @entity91 's ability to arm the @entity3 government			1
yet even if @entity14 weapons would not reach @entity3 forces for months , the very commitment to provide them would insert the @entity14 much more directly into the conflict			1
that commitment , more than the weapons themselves , is what could be a game changer			0
opponents of arming @entity3 have argued that weapons , even in fairly small quantities , could easily become the first step down a slippery slope of escalation			1
they are right , of course			0
but they also miss the bigger political context			0
the question is less whether some anti-tank missiles could turn the tide in the @entity12 , and more what the decision to provide those missiles would say about @entity91 's commitment to the fight for @entity3 and against @entity32			1
@entity32 forces could expand their involvement in the conflict in response to a @entity14 commitment to arm @entity44			0
but , to turn the skeptics ' argument about weapons provoking @entity32 escalation on its head : then what ? once it had committed to arming @entity3 , would @entity91 allow the @entity3 to be completely defeated ? would it pour arms into @entity3 until @entity32 forces faced an insurgency like the one that drove them from @entity135 in the 1980s and helped bring down the @entity136 ? would it impose truly drastic economic sanctions , cutting @entity32 off from global payment networks or bringing down the @entity32 banking system ? left to themselves , the @entity27 would be reluctant go down this path , but would likely do so should @entity88 expand the conflict in the face of a wider @entity14 role			1
and the reality is that despite @entity32 president @entity148 's bellicose rhetoric , no sane @entity32 believes @entity88 could win a protracted fight with the @entity14			1
while @entity32 officials are keen to portray the @entity14 as a declining power , in their more honest moments they appreciate the reality of @entity14 financial and military power ( perhaps more than many in the @entity57 administration do ) and are keen to avoid a test of strength they can not win			0
that is why @entity91 's aversion to lethal assistance and outsourcing the search for a solution in @entity3 to the @entity27 was a mistake			1
while better than letting @entity3 fight a losing war on its own , the @entity8 agreement remains heavily tilted in @entity88 's favor , even if it holds			1
earlier , and more assertive @entity14 involvement ( including a commitment to provide military assistance ) , would likely have produced a better , and quicker agreement			2
as it is , lethal assistance from the @entity14 should remain on the table , along with the prospect of more drastic sanctions , as long as the ceasefire remains tenuous			1
as @entity88 fully understands , only the @entity14 can confront @entity32 on its own terms			2
and if @entity91 truly cares about the success of @entity3 's transformation and checking @entity32 's revisionist aspirations , it needs to insert itself more squarely into the process , including with its hard power capabilities			1
above all , @entity91 must continue being the main underwriter of @entity27 security			0
the @entity187 knows that confronting the @entity14 is much different from confronting the divided , economically vulnerable @entity27			0
hopefully , the @entity23 does as well			0

violence continues despite the ceasefire between the @entity3 government and rebels
