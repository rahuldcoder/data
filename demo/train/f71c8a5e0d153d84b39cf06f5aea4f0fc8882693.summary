@entity0 -- @entity3 rep. @entity2 , a prominent 16 - term @entity4 from @entity5 and arch - enemy of political conservatives nationwide , announced monday that he does not intend to seek re-election in 2012			1
@entity2 , 71 , said his decision to retire from @entity10 was prompted partly by changes made to the boundaries of his @entity3 @entity14 district			1
as part of @entity5 ' recently concluded redistricting process , @entity15 will lose the heavily @entity19 blue - collar port city of @entity20 while gaining several smaller , more conservative towns			0
" i will miss this job , ( but ) the district is very substantially changed , " with roughly 325,000 new constituents , @entity2 told reporters			2
the veteran congressman said he was planning to retire after 2014 regardless , but said he did n't " want to be torn " next year between the need to serve his existing constituents , reach out to new district residents and protect his signature @entity30 financial regulatory reform law			1
president @entity32 issued a statement praising @entity2 's public service , calling the congressman a " fierce advocate for the people of @entity5 and @entity3 everywhere who needed a voice			2
" while @entity5 ' entire @entity14 delegation is @entity19 , local @entity40 insist @entity2 's retirement will put the reconfigured district in play			1

" republicans were already gearing up for a strong race and @entity2 's sudden retirement injects added optimism and excitement into the election			0
" @entity2 , first elected to the @entity3 @entity14 in 1980 , is the top @entity4 on the powerful @entity58			1
the controversial 2010 @entity30 measure , designed to rein in @entity61 excesses after the 2008 financial collapse , passed the @entity14 without any @entity40 support			1
@entity2 made headlines earlier in his career by becoming one of the first openly gay members of @entity10			1
he was formally reprimanded by the @entity14 in 1990 for allegations relating to his association with a male prostitute			2
launching his career as an aide to @entity74 mayor @entity73 in the late 1960s , @entity2 quickly became known for an acidic political wit			0
" one of the advantages to me of not running for office is i do n't even have to pretend to try to be nice to people i do n't like , " @entity2 joked with reporters monday			0
" some of you may not think i 've been good at it , but i 've been trying			0
" @entity2 's current district -- which extends from the affluent , liberal @entity74 suburbs of @entity85 and @entity86 to the cities of @entity20 and @entity88 -- is considered safe @entity19 political terrain			2
@entity2 did , however , receive an unusually strong challenge from @entity40 @entity91 in 2010			0
@entity2 ultimately defeated @entity91 , 54 % to 43 % .			0
