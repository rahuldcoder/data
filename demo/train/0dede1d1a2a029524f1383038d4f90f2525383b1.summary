you 're considering buying a new pair of tube socks			0
a quick @entity4 search pulls up some sock ads and below one of them you see your pal @entity9 's face next to a four - star review she 's left for @entity12 's @entity11			1
" great deals on super soft socks , and so many fun colors ! " @entity4 is betting that this type of personal recommendation from a friend will make people more likely to click on an ad			2
starting november 11 , @entity4 will be able to include @entity23 users ' faces , names and comments in ads. the content will be pulled from reviews they 've made on @entity23 or other tied - in @entity4 services like @entity30 or @entity31			1
the company updated its terms of service on friday to include the new language allowing these " shared endorsements			2
" the adver - dorsements wo n't just appear on regular @entity4 searches			0
@entity4 ads are a sprawling business and a person 's face could show up on any of the 2 million sites that are part of the @entity4 ad network			1
it 's difficult to avoid @entity23 , the social network and user identity hub @entity4 has been steadily grafting onto all of its popular services			1
even if you do n't think you have a @entity23 profile , there 's a good chance that one exists if you use the company 's other services			0
@entity23 reviews are already used in many of the company 's products			1
look for a restaurant on @entity61 , for instance , and you 'll see a star rating based on public reviews by @entity23 users			1
leave a review for an album you bought in the @entity31 store and that is a usable @entity23 endorsement			0
if you do n't want your face popping up in ads , it 's easy to opt out			1
there is a settings page for @entity23 accounts called @entity79			2
it explains exactly how the program works			0
read through and if you 're still uncomfortable with the idea , uncheck the box next to " based upon my activity , @entity4 may show my name and profile photo in shared endorsements that appear in ads. " you will still see familiar faces in ads , but your mug should no longer appear in other peoples ' searches			1
if you hit +1 for a site , people in your network will still be able to see that you 've liked it , which is not a new feature			0
if you are really determined not to show up anywhere , just do n't hit +1 or leave reviews on @entity4 products or in the @entity31 store			1
other social media companies have toyed with featuring their users ' photos in ads. if you like a company on @entity113 or post a positive review on its page , that can be used in that company 's @entity113 ads. you may have noticed a sponsored post in your @entity119 that shows which of your friends have liked a particular brand			0
as with @entity23 reviews , the key to not appearing in these types of ads is not endorsing brands			2
( unlike @entity4 , there 's no opt - out option for sponsored stories on @entity113			2
) the idea of promoting a brand and sharing positive opinions could appeal to many @entity23 users who are already actively leaving reviews			1
some people just really love brands , whether they 're sports drinks , smartphone makers , movies or video games			0
they want to broadcast that love to the world , sharing their positive opinions wide and far			0
negative opinions can be equally useful information for their friends and families , but those bad reviews are not usable by advertisers			0
and for now , there 's no -1 button on @entity23 or dislike button for @entity113 .			0

@entity4 will be able to show people 's faces and reviews in ads starting in november
" @entity79 " pull from *+1s* and reviews @entity23 users leave for companies
@entity4 *announced* the update to its terms of service on friday
anyone who does not want their face to appear in ads can opt out
