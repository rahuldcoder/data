-- avoiding the fiscal cliff can be a moment of truth for @entity4 as an institution			1
the ability of @entity4 to reach a deal on its own , rather than relying on tax hikes and spending cuts by default , would be a powerful push back against the loud chorus of critics who for almost a decade have been decrying dysfunction on @entity15			1
according to a recent @entity18 poll , @entity16 consider legislators to be some of the least trusted professionals in the nation			0
car salespeople ranked only slightly lower			0
this is not the first time that @entity16 have felt this way			0
during the early 1960s , @entity4 was widely derided as a broken branch of government			2
a bipartisan alliance of @entity29 and @entity30 used the committee process to bottle up legislation for years			2
" the sapless branch , " sen. @entity33 called @entity4 in an outburst of frustration with his colleagues			2
but this period of gridlock was followed by a huge burst of legislation that resulted in tax cuts , voting rights , civil rights , @entity45 and @entity46 , education policy , a @entity48 and much more			0
@entity49 : how will the ' fiscal cliff ' affect you ? though it would be far short of a @entity53 or @entity54 , a budget deal would allow @entity4 to prove that the critics are off			1
most important , @entity4 could show that it can make unpopular decisions with little or no political payoff			1
the thing about this budget deal is that nobody would be happy with the outcome			1
if @entity29 win , they walk away by raising some people 's taxes			0
if @entity30 win , they will cut deep into the spending of programs that are enormously popular throughout large parts of the electorate			0
the willingness of representatives and senators to take unpopular action is the best sign that the institution can fix national problems and not simply reward constituents			0
a budget deal could also show that bipartisanship is not impossible in our current era of polarization			1
the inability to achieve bipartisan legislation has been one of the biggest failings of @entity4			1
when there has been bipartisan agreement in recent years on domestic policy , it has usually meant that two or three people come on board from the other side of the aisle			0
the era when @entity97 senate minority leader @entity97 could bring over 20 or more colleagues for legislation proposed by a @entity101 president , back in the 1960s , seems long gone			0
the virtue of bipartisan deals is that they create bills that are more durable over time and have the imprint of a broader portion of the @entity16 public			2
bipartisan votes on legislation demonstrate that support for a bill is not red or blue , but red , white and blue			2
@entity16 already making big decisions over cliff a budget deal could show that it is possible to have responsible partisanship			1
in recent decades , public debate has revolved around whether it is better to have a partisan divide , where @entity29 and @entity30 offer voters clear alternatives , or bipartisanship , where both sides find areas of agreement			0
the alternate path is responsible partisanship , whereby the parties are willing to sign onto bills where each loses something significant			1
they must abide by @entity97 's maxim : " i am a man of fixed and unbending principles , the first of which is to be flexible at all times			0
" responsible partisanship would offer voters the best of both worlds -- a partisan system with the capacity for governance			1
so the budget deal can be a big deal , not only for the nation but also for restoring public trust in @entity4			1
if @entity4 fails to reach a deal on its own , or if it tries to kick the issue down the road by extending the deadline , the chances are that the terrible perceptions of the legislative branch will only get worse			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0
