-- last year , we learned that the @entity2 had come to an end			1
it ended in june 2009 , the experts said			1
but , for many @entity7 , the declaration had little meaning and was of little solace			1
unemployment is still high and economic hardship is commonplace			1
during 2010 , six @entity12 followed someone they knew in their community to get a measure of how the economy was affecting people 's lives			1
they related stories of perseverance , reinvention , doubt and success			1
' feed your spirit ' in february , @entity27 , after more than 25 years on the job , was forced into an early retirement			1
the 58 - year - old from @entity30 , @entity31 , was given a severance by his company , which helped provide some stability			1
see all the stories on @entity0 's @entity36 by march , he was still looking for a job			1
as he searched , his wife , a psychologist who used to work one day a week , began working more			1
meanwhile , @entity27 took on more of the work around the house			1
" you think when that when you go away for five days a week and come back , that things just happen around the house , " he said			1
" his severance pay came to an end in september			1
@entity27 picked up work as a consultant once a week in addition to occasional substitute teaching gigs			1
however , he had two kids in college and another on the way to college			1
and he had to plan for retirement			1
he needed another job , but the experience of unemployment had changed his perspective			1
" the main thing i think i 've discovered , kind of later in my career , is that there are two things you want to do when you look for a job , " he said			1
" you want to feed your family , for sure			1
but you also want to feed your spirit			1
" as 2010 came to a close , the consulting contract was renewed and expanded , and other consulting engagements were becoming possible , @entity27 said			1
but he appears to be a changed man when it comes to his work			1
" i 'm definitely not going to be working full - time for another company , " he said			1
" i 'm always going to be working by myself as a contractor under a company name , which is my own			1
" ' that extra leap ' as 2010 began , @entity79 -- who lives in @entity80 , @entity81 , with his wife , @entity83 , and a 4 - year - old son -- faced a dilemma			2
the 33 - year - old college administrator and his family wanted to move from their townhouse to a single - family home			2
they first had to sell the current one			2
but the price of their house fell with the collapse of the housing market			2
" the cost of our home is such that we ca n't really leave until it flips back around to some kind of profit , " he said in december 2009			2
@entity79 , who describes himself as an optimist , was also frustrated with limited job opportunities			2
" i think that when times are as rough as they are right now in the economy , you really have to rely on yourself to take that extra leap , " he said			1
he created five mikes , an entrepreneurial project based around his motivational speaking engagements			2
he entered the search for an advice guru for @entity116 's " @entity115 " and reached the semifinal stage			1
and , by the fall , @entity79 got a new job at his university and transitioned to a new office			2
ultimately , @entity79 and his wife decided to stay put and not sell their @entity124 townhouse			2
yet the year was " awesome , " he said			2
he is , however , humble about the good fortune that has come his way			2
" some people are really , really suffering , and i 'm happy that our family is n't necessarily on that level , " he said			1
" but if either my wife or i lose our job , we could be one of those people			1
" we 're just one mishap away			2
" ' life halted ' ask @entity136 about 2010 , and she 'll tell you about mishaps			2
well , frankly , she may use other words			2
toward the end of october 2009 , @entity136 , who lives in @entity140 , @entity141 , was laid off when her newspaper merged with a competitor			2
she began collecting unemployment benefits , looked for other jobs , searched for freelance writing opportunities and decided to create a public relations company			2
then , in april , she ruptured her appendix , complications developed , and she had to spend two weeks in the hospital			2
" life halted , " she said			2
her unemployment benefits ran out midsummer but were renewed because of a federal extension			2
" i have mixed feelings about that , but i do n't talk politics , so i wo n't , " she said			0
the search for another job stretched into the fall			0
" it 's very interesting when you 're changing careers and you 're trying to make jobs skills translate in an obvious way , " she said			1
" you know you can do it , but you have to express that you can do it			0
" as october rolled around , she was still without a job , marking the longest stretch of time she was unemployed in her working life			0
she finally received some good news in november			0
she got a part - time job that could become a full - time job , she said			0
it also gives her time to develop her freelance opportunities			0
' roll with the punches ' @entity181 has been a tattoo artist for 16 years			0
he owns @entity182 , a tattoo parlor in @entity184 , @entity185			0
heavily reliant on the disposable income of his customers , he was a bit nervous when the year started			0
" i 've seen a lot of customers lose their jobs , " he said			0
walk - in traffic was down , and gift certificate sales were smaller than in previous year			0
but as the weather warmed , business picked up , especially around the time people started receiving their tax refunds			1
" people are more spontaneous with their money at tax time , " he said			1
" it 's like @entity203 for us			1
" but sales were again down when winter returned			0
" as a business owner , you do get tired of ( the ups and downs ) , but you got ta feed your family , so you roll with the punches , " he said			0
growing small is the key to success in today 's economy , and the at times turbulent year made him a smarter businessman , @entity181 said			1
he cut back on expenses whenever possible and put money into the business when he could			0
" i think it made me plan a lot more for the future , " he said			0
an ambitious plan growth was very much in the plans for 2010 for @entity227 and @entity228 , owners of @entity230 , a specialty bra company			0
with 11 stores already in existence , the @entity232 , @entity233 - based couple looked forward to their biggest expansion -- the opening of five stores -- in a single year since they launched the company 18 years ago			0
" we 're feeling very strong and very bullish , " @entity228 said			0
by june , the @entity242 had opened two new locations -- in @entity244 and @entity245 -- and were preparing to open a second store in @entity245			0
@entity228 credited increased marketing and a popular customer referral program as two main contributors to the company 's success			1
by the end of the year , @entity230 opened all five new locations across the country			0
" despite the recession , we were able to grow our company by just under 30 percent this year , which is really phenomenal , " @entity255 said			0
' you never know ' @entity260 , a small - business owner in @entity244 , would probably not describe herself as " bullish			0
" she owns @entity261 , which has two locations : one in the @entity263 and another in @entity264			0
the troubled economy of the past few years has made her pragmatic and cautious			1
in the more than 20 years that she has run her business , 2008 was the worst economy she 'd ever seen , she said			1
" the recession has made me cautious of the eggs i do have in my basket , " she said			0
" i do n't have the time in front of me to take any more risks like i used to			0
i have to be realistic			0
" @entity273 , when tourists frequent the café , saw a boost in business , but it was down in relation to years past			0
the summer was a mixed bag			0
it was a record month in may and an " all right " june , but july " tanked big time , " she said			0
and , the quiet streets of winter did n't help			0
sales floundered in october and november , she said			0
but two decades in business teach you lessons in survival			0
@entity290 brought in a new chef			0
she also began a digital and social media strategy to get the word out about the café			0
it seems to be having an effect			0
during a conversation late last year , @entity290 said that it had managed to stop the plunge in sales and that business had picked up			0
" the only thing i hope is that while we 're moving forward in a positive way , something else does n't show up around that corner that makes it all tumble down , " she said			0
" @entity0 's @entity309 contributed to this report .			1
