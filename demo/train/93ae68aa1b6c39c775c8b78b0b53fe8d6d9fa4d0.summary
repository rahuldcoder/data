-- @entity1 is something of a celebrity in the running world			1
every year around this time , his phone starts to ring off the hook as he passes another milestone in his " running streak " -- the number of consecutive days he 's logged at least a mile			1
this week he hit 44 years , or 16,075 days in a row			1
it 's the longest active streak ever recorded by the @entity12			1
his closest competitor is @entity14 , who 's logged 15,768 days			2
@entity1 , now 61 , started his streak on july 23 , 1968 , as a high school senior			1
in 1970 he was named the @entity18 individual cross country champion , and he helped his @entity21 , @entity20 cross country team grab a @entity23 title the year after			2
in 1972 , @entity1 placed seventh at the @entity26 olympic marathon trials			1
@entity1 , now a coach and teacher at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , still logs between 35 and 45 miles a week			1
we caught up with him to ask for his " streaking " tips			2
the following is an edited version of that interview : why did you start running every day ? i had no idea this was going to happen			1
the summer after i graduated , early in my freshman year of college , i realized i was in 100 days without missing one			2
i wondered if i could get a year in without missing			2
that became a little bit of a goal			2
that year turned to two , to three			2
at four or five years , i thought , this is a big deal			1
i truly look forward to putting my shoes on every day			1
... it 's something that makes me feel better , something that in a lot of ways is therapeutic -- not only physically but mentally			2
it 's something i enjoy			2
what 's your running routine like ? i run in the morning			1
there 's no real set time , just earlier in the morning			2
i usually run between 50 to 60 minutes			1
some days i go shorter , some days i run 80 minutes			1
i 'm sure i do n't run as fast as i used to			1
i tell people the trees pass me by real slow now , but that 's ok			2
i 'm still getting something out of it			0
how do you fuel your run ? i eat nothing before i go run			1
i 'm up for maybe half an hour , then go out the door			0
when i come back , i eat a regular breakfast -- oatmeal one day , toast with peanut butter and jelly another day			1
as i 've gotten older , you try to eat a little bit better and little bit wiser			0
lunch , usually an apple and some almonds			0
dinner is chicken , fish , a salad , vegetables			0
one of the things i struggle with is my weight			0
as i 've gotten older ... my weight has kind of crept up			0
that 's a never - ending battle			0
do you struggle to drag yourself out of bed in the morning ? i do n't have any problem getting out of bed in the morning			0
i have a sleep disorder , so i wake up early -- four o'clock			0
getting out the door and running for me has never been a problem			1
when i was younger , when i was in college , i was training for races and things like that and it was something i was committed to being the best i can be			0
as i 've gotten older , it 's something that 's just ingrained			0
was there any day that you thought , ' i 'm just not going to be able to run today ' ? the two most recent ones -- seven years ago i had surgery on my knee			1
the day after that was a challenge , but i was able to get out and get a mile in			1
fifteen months ago , i hurt my back			0
that was really a challenge because it was hard to walk , hard to bend over			0
i hurt it running and when i got back i went to the doctor and he was able to give me a little bit of relief			1
but the three or four days after that were really uncomfortable and painful			0
i 'm assuming your doctor told you not to run			1
( @entity115 ) i 've surrounded myself with great doctors over the years that have kind of bought into this craziness			1
they understand if they told me ' no ' i 'd go out and try to do it anyway			0
they 'd never say , ' go out and try this ' if it was going to cause real damage			0
they 've been really tremendously supportive			0
how do you push through aches and pains ? i slow things down a whole lot -- stay within things that are manageable			0
i try not to do things that are going to make it a lot worse			0
people that have these running streaks like this , our pain threshold is a little bit higher than most			1
most of the time i find after 10 or 15 minutes i tend to warm up a little bit and find i can move along a little bit better			0
how do you get through that last mile ? you 're trying to finish your run up pretty strong , whether it be a mile , half mile or 10 minutes from your house			1
it 's a matter of bearing down and concentrating on what you want to get out of that workout at the time			0
i 've always thought that you have to become somewhat comfortable with being uncomfortable			0
when you 're working out , we all feel a little bit uncomfortable			0
and this might sound ridiculous , but i kind of like feeling uncomfortable -- i think there 's great benefit from that , physically and psychologically			0
that 's something , i think , in that last mile finishing up , you just have to wrap yourself up in that uncomfortable feeling and kind of go with it .			2
