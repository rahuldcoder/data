-- @entity2 's flashy visit to @entity3 is just a big elaborate show			1
do n't be fooled by it			0
the bizarre , seemingly lighthearted episode comes at a time when tensions are again running high and overshadows the pain and suffering faced by ordinary @entity3			1
the regime is continuing its dangerous weapons tests , treating its population terribly and starving countless people			1
on tuesday , @entity3 issued new hostile threats , this time to nullify the armistice agreement that ended the @entity16 in 1953			2
the regime has made threats in the past , but the intensity of its recent belligerence is unusual			0
@entity3 blatantly violated multiple @entity21 with its december 2012 rocket test and its third nuclear test in february			2
it has made hostile statements toward the @entity25 and @entity26 in reaction to the announcement of the new @entity30 resolution that imposed more sanctions on the regime			0
just when the situation seemed to be getting worse , the world suddenly saw the young leader @entity35 receiving an @entity25 star with great hospitality and enjoying an afternoon of basketball			0
what this portrait lacks is the unimaginable level of the suffering of people inside the country who are deprived of basic human rights and food			1
the regime 's track record on human rights is even more ominous than its threats of rockets and nuclear weapons that often provoke the international community			1
@entity3 's history is marred by decades of unimaginable famine			2
in 2011 , @entity57 listed the regime as one of the seven worst violators of human rights in the world			1
it is a place where political prisoners languish in gulags , escaped defectors testify of cannibalism , and famines decimate the population			0
the latest reports indicate that the food situation appears to be somewhat improved			0
in a recent survey conducted by @entity30 agencies , the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children was 27.9 % and acute malnutrition was 4 %			0
these are not just numbers and statistics			0
children 's growth and development is being permanently stunted			0
the impact of endless hunger and recurrent famine has tremendous long - lasting impact on the @entity3 people			1
it has been estimated that 3.5 million @entity3 died of starvation in the severe famine of the 1990s			2
in its november 2012 crop and food security assessment , the @entity30 predicted a gap of 207,000 tons of food this year in @entity3			2
this deficit exists in spite of planned imports and @entity100 assistance			0
in human terms , this translates into a situation where about half the country 's most vulnerable population , those who are dependent on the regime 's public food distribution system for sustenance , are severely food insecure			1
the fact is that , even if @entity3 's harvests are improved this season , the public food distribution system is still extremely vulnerable to shocks , such as severe weather			2
at these levels of malnourishment , dramatic improvements to the system are still needed to ensure people are safe from famine caused by the next flood or severe drought			0
the world must be careful not to be blinded by congenial games and friendly speeches coming out of @entity3			1
it 's just a staged show			0
it does n't actually solve any of the problems the country is facing			0
most importantly , such sideshows are not in the interest of the @entity3 people			1
some may contend that @entity2 's visit brought exposure to the regime , which may in turn translate to some benefits , whether it is improved business relations , better communication or more spotlight through other famous stars			1
however , the world should not be distracted by the dictatorship 's @entity146 and attempts at friendly gestures to lure other countries to start a dialogue or defuse the tensions it has created			0
instead , the world needs to focus on the dire situation of the @entity3 people and stay committed to finding solutions that will alleviate their hunger and improve their living situations			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 and @entity164 .			1

@entity163 , @entity164 : @entity2 's flashy visit to @entity3 is just a big show
@entity163 , @entity164 : bizarre episode overshadows the suffering of @entity3 people
they say the regime is listed as one of the seven worst violators of human rights in the world
