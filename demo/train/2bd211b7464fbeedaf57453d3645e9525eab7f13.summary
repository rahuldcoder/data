-- so many tyrants to resist , so many heroes to support , but the @entity3 decided to ignore all of that and grant the @entity5 this year to a large bureaucratic political alliance , the @entity7			1
the committee passed up a chance to give a tangible boost to and put the valuable global spotlight on an individual , a cause or an organization that could really benefit from the award			1
what a sadly missed opportunity			1
@entity5 is a slap on the back for a struggling @entity7 @entity18 , the 14 - year - old @entity19 girl shot by the @entity20 for advocating girls ' right to an education , is precisely the kind of person who should have inspired those making the selection			1
there 's only one @entity18 , but there are countless people around the world doing heroic work every day , many risking their lives to end tyranny , hunger and illiteracy			2
i have nothing against the @entity7			1
it has accomplished important things , and the @entity42 who award the @entity5 surely wanted to give it recognition during a time of economic turmoil and political tension in @entity48			1
still , the @entity49 wasted the moment			2
we are living through a time when competing forces are fighting for radically different visions of the future			1
activists for democracy , for women 's rights , for religious tolerance have faced off against state security forces , religious extremists and brutal misogynists			2
@entity64 prosecutors , loyal to authoritarian regimes , have imprisoned artists , executed homosexuals and tortured democracy activists			2
those permitted to nominate candidates gave the panel ideas , a dazzling collection of extraordinary organizations and individuals			2
the list will remain secret for half a century , but that did n't keep people from speculating about who might win			2
the favorites included @entity80 , a doctor and human rights activist who served as @entity84 's women 's affairs minister until she was forced out with death threats for challenging laws that oppress women			2
there 's @entity89 , a @entity90 nun in @entity91 whose @entity93 charity helps @entity95 children living in @entity97 's slums			2
in @entity100 , where clashes between @entity102 and @entity103 have left hundreds dead and threaten to tear up the country , archbishop @entity98 and @entity99 are fighting for reconciliation			2
in @entity107 , blogger @entity106 struggles for democratic reform in and out of jail , as do other dissidents languish in prison			0
in @entity116 , where journalists who criticize the government turn up dead much too frequently , the number of courageous writers and artists standing up for reform includes many courageous figures			0
the list goes on and on			0
and , in case anyone doubts just what a difference the @entity5 can make , consider some of the inspired choices the @entity42 panel has made			1
the military junta ruling @entity127 , which renamed the country @entity127 , had locked up pro-democracy leader @entity129 , whose party , the @entity130 , won the 1990 election			0
when she was awarded the @entity5 in 1991 , her cause -- the plight of the @entity127 people -- became the world 's struggle			1
she was not allowed to travel to @entity137 for the awards ceremony			0
but the @entity127 people discovered that they were not alone			0
after many years , including more than a decade of house arrest , she was set free in 2010			0
she traveled to @entity137 to receive the prize in person , and now it looks as though @entity127 stands at the threshold of freedom			1
the @entity5 of 1975 drew attention to the work of @entity148 dissident @entity147 , the physicist who became , in the committee 's words , " a spokesman for the conscience of mankind			1
" he spent years in exile in @entity156 , but his work helped forge the nuclear test ban and international cooperation			0
the award became a megaphone for his ideals			0
in the past , the @entity3 committee has proved daring and controversial			1
this time , it was supremely uninspired			1
nonviolent figures such as the rev. @entity166 , the @entity167 and @entity169 's @entity168 became household names because they received the prize			0
their protest techniques became subjects of academic study and practical guidance around the globe			0
their selection inspired last year 's winner , @entity180 dissident @entity179 , author of " @entity181 , @entity182 , " another of several @entity3 winners who could not attend the awards ceremony because their governments put them in prison or banned them from traveling			1
the @entity3 spotlight can bring donations and needed publicity to a cause			1
the push for a landmines ban started making headlines after @entity194 and her campaign to @entity196 won in 1997			0
true , the committee 's choice always upsets some people			1
but it 's more frequently because of boldness than blandness			0
naturally , the choice can be politically charged			0
after @entity205 won in 2009 , with just a few months in office , it left many scratching their heads			0
when told of the announcement , @entity168 said , " who , @entity205 ? ... he has n't had the time to do anything yet			2
" @entity205 went on to stun his hosts when he received the award			0
his @entity3 lecture turned out to be a brilliant exposition of when war becomes a requirement for peace			1
it was not exactly what they expected from a @entity5 winner			1
the decision reflected the committee 's hopes more than @entity205 's achievements			2
the panel wanted @entity205 to become the president of peace			0
he accepted the award , but it turned out he was not a pacifist			0
the choice for this year also reflects aspirational views			0
the @entity49 , selected by @entity42 's parliament and made up mostly of politicians , is telling the world , specifically @entity48 , that they should do whatever it takes to save the @entity7			1
it is asking them to remember that @entity48 , the continent that in the 20th century perpetrated the worst wars the world has seen , has managed to stay mostly at peace for almost 70 years			0
the committee gives the credit to the @entity7			1
it was a retrospective award , a historical analysis			0
what the committee should have done was use this chance to take sides and to speak in a way that makes a difference in favor of freedom , equality and tolerance			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			0

the @entity3 awarded the @entity5 to the @entity7
@entity261 : what a sadly missed opportunity
she says the committee passed on chance to put global spotlight on person or cause
@entity271 : @entity5 can make a difference ; this time it was supremely uninspired
