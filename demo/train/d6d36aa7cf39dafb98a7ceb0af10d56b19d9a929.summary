" after @entity24 rejected the signature , he took off his mask , " she said			0
" now we can see his real , true authoritarian face and that he never really intended to go towards @entity101 or , moreover , fulfill the criteria for the democratization of @entity3			0
" @entity288 of @entity289 , a @entity106 - based nongovernmental organization , said : " @entity24 has decided it 's more important to keep @entity261 in prison than to integrate @entity3 closer toward @entity101			1

that will be @entity24 's legacy if he does n't reverse course			2
