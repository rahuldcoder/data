@entity0 , @entity1 -- republicans avoided a major headache on tuesday night when @entity5 , the @entity1 house speaker and establishment favorite , won the @entity3 @entity8 nomination outright , dodging a protracted summer runoff fight against a grassroots - backed opponent			1
with an assist from big - spending outside groups , @entity5 dispatched his two main primary rivals , tea party - backed @entity15 and the @entity18 pastor @entity17 , with relative ease , clearing the 40 % mark needed to skirt a july runoff election			1
@entity5 moves on to face @entity23 sen. @entity22 , one of the @entity8 's most endangered incumbents , in what 's certain to be among the most negative -- and expensive -- races of 2014			1
2014 midterms : six factors between now and election day but that was n't the only story line unfolding on tuesday			0
here are five takeaways from primary night in @entity1			0
@entity3 establishment passes early test : the @entity3 establishment — that galaxy of @entity39 - based political operatives , national party committees and business groups who care first and foremost about winning — promised early on that they would n't let controversial candidates jeopardize their chances of re-taking the @entity8 this year			1
@entity1 was the first test in their mission to make sure that no @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49 would be on the @entity8 ballot in 2014			1
the @entity51 and the @entity53 - backed @entity52 spent north of $ 2 million propping up state house speaker @entity5 when the candidate himself lacked the resources to go on statewide television			2
a few weeks ago , most republicans in @entity1 were predicting that @entity5 would not be able to break 40 % of the vote , thereby forcing a july runoff election			0
but with the help of outside spending , a largely error - free campaign and the inability of his underfunded grassroots challengers to land a punch , @entity5 surged late and cleared the runoff hurdle easily			0
@entity3 are breathing easier , confident they have the candidate with the best shot to beat @entity69			1
key races to watch in 2014 2			0
@entity23 open up the extremist playbook : the @entity72 fired off a memo to reporters right after @entity5 secured the @entity3 nomination			1
" @entity5 : extreme , scandal plagued conservative : bring it on , " it was titled			0
no surprise there : for the better part of a year , @entity22 's campaign has been planning to paint @entity5 as a right - wing ideologue who , as state house speaker , curtailed voting rights , slashed education budgets and fought to limit women 's access to contraception and abortion			0
they were just hoping he 'd have to slog through a nasty @entity3 - on - @entity3 runoff first			1
now the general election begins			0
democrats will work overtime to render @entity5 unacceptable to suburban women and middle class voters by hitting him on issues like women 's health and wages			0
@entity5 plans to tie @entity22 to president @entity102 and his health care law at every turn			0
if that sounds like the dynamic of pretty much every other federal race in the country so far this year , well , that 's because it is			0
@entity111 stumbles : @entity111 gambled — and lost			1
after spending much of the last two years making nice with the @entity3 establishment as he lays groundwork for a 2016 presidential bid , @entity111 confounded @entity3 by making a last minute trip to @entity0 to campaign for @entity15 , a controversial tea party candidate who turned out to be @entity5 ' most serious primary opponent			1
@entity111 called @entity15 a " hero " and a " dragon slayer " at a rally outside the @entity122 on monday , saying he would shake up the status quo in @entity39			1
@entity15 supporters hoped it would bring a last minute burst of energy to their upstart campaign			0
but for paul - watchers , the appearance was a head - scratcher			0
a bloody @entity5 - @entity15 runoff was precisely the scenario that @entity39 republicans who might help @entity111 in 2016 — including @entity8 minority leader @entity134 , his fellow @entity135 — were hoping to avoid			1
and while @entity111 had already endorsed @entity15 , he was further grafting himself onto a flawed candidate who was recently found liable by a jury for misleading investors in a failed tech firm			1
the @entity135 senator said his endorsement was about principle			2
but @entity111 has also developed a reputation as a canny political operator who is taking a methodical approach to the presidential race			1
he did n't look very savvy in @entity1 , where he put his political muscle to the test but could n't pull his favored candidate over the finish line			1
@entity111 was quick to save face			1
he endorsed @entity5 on @entity153 soon after the race was called , and urged republicans to unite behind him			0
immigration fight fizzles : rep. @entity157 is a rare specimen : a @entity159 @entity3 who backs immigration reform , including a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants			1
she calls it " an earned legal work status			0
" conservatives , of course , call it " amnesty			0
" @entity157 , a nurse from @entity1 's @entity168 who was elected in 2010 with @entity170 support , has been unapologetic , tangling with her constituents over the issue in town hall meetings and calling conservative radio talker @entity174 " ignorant " during a recent on - air debate about immigration			2
her immigration reform cheerleading drew the attention of a pro-immigration reform group backed by @entity153 founder @entity181 , which ran television ads on her behalf			2
but she also drew a conservative primary challenger : a radio talk show host and @entity3 perma - candidate named @entity189			1
@entity189 hit @entity157 hard , framing his entire candidacy as a referendum on @entity157 ' support for immigration reform and her willingness to work with the @entity3 establishment			1
@entity197 's poorly funded campaign gave @entity157 a scare , but in the end she skated to a primary win			0
anti-war @entity3 survives : rep. @entity202 , a 20 - year incumbent from the state 's coastal 3rd district , faced perhaps the toughest challenge of his long career from @entity207 , a @entity3 strategist and former @entity209 administration official from @entity39 who returned to @entity210 to run for the seat			2
@entity207 's critique of @entity202 centered on the congressman 's libertarian drift			0
@entity202 famously broke with his party over foreign policy during the @entity217 , calling it a mistake and predicting that former vice president @entity220 will someday rot in hell			2
@entity202 became an ardent supporter of @entity223 , voted to regulate @entity224 , and has been a regular thorn in the side of @entity159 @entity3 leaders like @entity228 , who kicked him off the @entity230 in 2012			2
@entity207 labeled @entity202 the " most liberal " @entity3 in @entity231 , a questionable line of attack considering @entity202 ' fierce social conservatism			2
but @entity207 worked hard and had the support of hawkish outside groups who ran blistering television and radio ads against @entity202 , and he picked up a a late endorsement from @entity241			2
but it was probably too late			0
@entity202 , with his deep ties to the district , survived			0
@entity3 in @entity1 , however , believe @entity207 scuffed @entity202 up enough to make him vulnerable in 2016			2
that 's if he does n't retire first			0
@entity3 establishment 1 , tea party 0 after @entity8 primary @entity249 has slim edge in @entity1 primary			1

@entity3 establishment passes early test in family feud with tea party
@entity23 quick to label @entity8 candidate an " extremist "
@entity111 moves quickly to save face after *curious* endorsement
fight over immigration turns out to be fizzle rather than fury
