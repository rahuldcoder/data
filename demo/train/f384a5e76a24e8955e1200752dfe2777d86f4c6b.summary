@entity0 , @entity1 -- five months after the @entity4 explosion unleashed a torrent of oil into the @entity7 , a male dolphin washed up on @entity10 's @entity9 just barely alive			1
" other dead ones [ dolphins ] had exterior oiling on them , " recalls @entity11 of the @entity12 in @entity13			1
" he was the first live oiled marine mammal			0
" oil covered the dolphin 's body , but little was found in his blowhole or mouth -- a good sign			1
rescuers noticed that the animal appeared to be underweight for his size and put his age at about 2 years old			0
the rescuers also saw injuries and believe he was beaten by another dolphin			2
" for an animal as young as he is , he has a stat of about a 5 % chance of survival , " said @entity11 , who oversees the rescue of stranded animals in @entity10 for the @entity12			1
" him , i would have given him maybe 2 % max. he had a lot of issues , oil was his final issue			2
" explore the depths of the @entity51 disaster the rescue team photographed him and recorded him under the name @entity55			0
he was later given the nickname " @entity57			0
" the rescue team took @entity57 to the @entity59 in @entity13 , cleaned him off , and began teaching him how to swim again			1
a staff member had to be in the water with him around the clock to hold @entity57 above the waterline so he could breathe			0
otherwise , he would sink			0
it took over two and half weeks until the little dolphin showed signs of improvement			2
@entity57 started eating fish on his own and started learning how to swim again by moving his tail up and down			2
that was the beginning of an intense rehabilitation process			0
in the end it would take 700 hours of care over five months before @entity57 would be declared healthy			2
that was a bittersweet time for the @entity59 staff			0
you shed tears , " @entity11 says , " you put five months into this animal , his rehab and seeing him everyday and taking care of him			2
then it 's time for him to go and we know that it 's the best thing for him			0
" despite his progress , it is too risky to release @entity57 into the wild because of his young age			0
so this week , with the help of the @entity93 , @entity57 was transported the @entity94 in the @entity95 , a nonprofit organization that cares for rescued dolphins			1
" in dolphin maturity he would still be dependent on his mom and that whole structure of a maturity pod to learn foraging , to learn survival techniques , avoiding predators , things like that , " said @entity98 , a spokeswoman for @entity94			1
in @entity10 , 62 dolphins have been collected since the oil spill , and all but two were found dead , according to @entity11			1
one of the two rescued died during rehabilitation			0
this left @entity57 as @entity10 's sole survivor , and the only rehabilitated dolphin to survive the worst oil spill in @entity117 history			1
timeline : oil spill in the @entity7 having just arrived at his new home , @entity57 will eventually be integrated into a group of other dolphins at the facility			1
he will also have to get used to his name , which he received upon arrival in the @entity95			1
" part of the reason we named him @entity129 is to immediately connect him to his @entity10 roots because here you have a little guy who has a real survivor story to tell , " @entity98 says			1
" he serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting these animals out in the wild and protecting the environment			0
