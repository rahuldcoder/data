-- @entity1 is getting pushed around a lot these days			1
digerati reaction to the @entity4 was " meh , " response to the @entity6 was akin to " it 's about time " and we are all more excited about unicorn - like products such as an @entity11 and @entity12 than the things you can buy right now			1
@entity1 's strength is its achilles ' heel : we expect it to reinvent on schedule and when , in our infinite wisdom , we believe it is not , we treat it like the kid who no longer belongs in our clique			1
some of this is to be expected when a company with as incredible a recent track record as @entity1 's seems to be resting more on its laurels than finding new battles to win			1
since the quixotic introduction of the @entity30 in 1998 -- reinvigorating the desktop computer well into the age of portables -- @entity1 has been on a tear : the @entity35 ( 2001 ) the @entity36 , allowing the purchase of single music tracks ( 2003 ) the @entity1 retail store ( 2004 ) the @entity4 ( 2007 ) the @entity6 ( 2010 ) and you can add to list that @entity42 ' revitalization of the animated feature film through his acquisition of @entity45			1
that 's a lot of imagination in a very short time			2
@entity1 has n't just dominated the story for a decade : it has written the story of the past decade			1
that is a lot to live up to			0
it 's particularly brutal for tech ( as opposed to , say , shampoo ) companies , which at best can usually hope to set the pace for only about generation until they settle into a comfortable middle class			2
@entity61 dominated through the red - hot ' 90s , the height of the @entity65 era			2
it is n't going anywhere			0
it still prints money by selling @entity70 and @entity72 licenses			0
but look at a five - year stock price chart , and you 'll see it has gone exactly nowhere			2
the only people dancing for joy about owning a @entity72 computer seem to be in those @entity80 ads. at the bottom of the pile there is the sad tale of @entity85 -- the hottest tech company on the planet for far too brief a time			0
but the company stumbled by failing to recognize quickly enough that , in the age of the @entity92 , no one wanted a portable device that could n't get online			0
how @entity94 is out - innovating @entity1 another hard luck case is @entity96 -- now @entity97			1
that company did get the portable device memo , but it spectacularly misjudged the smartphone revolution sparked by @entity1			1
now @entity1 is this unfamiliar territory : successful on paper , products seen everywhere , macbooks and @entity4 placed in seemingly every tv show and movie and yet ... the cool factor is cooling off			1
there is a big difference between atmospherics and actuality , of course			0
but nobody wants to be thought of as a has - been in the making			0
the lesson of tech history is that smart companies crash when they believe what they have already done is all they need to do : that doubling - down and trash - talking the competition is what it takes			0
exhibit a ? @entity61 ceo @entity126 himself , whose initial public reaction to the @entity4 was that business customers would n't want it " because it does n't have a keyboard , which makes it not a very good e-mail machine			2
" this would be a good time to mention that increasingly large numbers of these " business customers " now want an iphone at work , challenging @entity61 at what has been its enterprise stronghold			0
@entity1 's search for its next billion - dollar product success is never assured , but it can only be extended only two ways : if you corner the market , impossible in the uberdisruptive tech space , or if you are unabashedly willing to question everything , all the time			1
@entity149 began life as the world 's most exclusive private social network -- only @entity154 students need apply			0
but it became a public company worth $ 68 billion because it decided instead to become the world 's least exclusive private network			0
even @entity85 's trajectory might have been different if it had inverted its thinking in time : imagine a @entity162 not as a personal information manager with connectivity , but a connected device with pim applications , and you have described exactly what the smartphone is today			0
there is no reason to think @entity1 wo n't thrive financially for years to come , just like @entity61			1
but its continued reputation as the chief arbiter of cool is being challenged			0
@entity1 may still have the best - selling smartphone in the world , but the many others powered by rival @entity180 's @entity179 operating system -- and especially those made by @entity94 -- far exceed the @entity4			1
for years , tech writers reviewed each new smartphone on a simple grading scale : is this the @entity4 killer ? none has been , but collectively the point has been made : no phone has killed the @entity4 , but plenty of them co-exist just fine , thank you very much			1
we expect the unexpected from @entity1 , and the company does nothing to tamp down these expectations			1
so when it does n't dazzle us , ennui begins to creep in			0
@entity1 is also burdened by what i called at the time the meaningless milestone of having become the biggest company ever			2
where do you go from there ? you are either still the biggest , or slipping			0
consolidating your lead is fine and all , but it is n't sexy			0
my own prediction of @entity1 's prospects is that needs to worry about becoming a mid-packer only after the ceo @entity210 and designer @entity211 -- the other tow members of the triumvirate headed by @entity42 -- are no longer with the company			1
until then , perhaps a decade from now , you bet against @entity1 at your own peril			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

@entity218 : reactions to @entity4 and @entity6 were , for new @entity1 products , *lukewarm*
@entity218 : @entity1 a *prisoner* of its reputation ; we expect new products in quick succession
@entity179 - run products are threatening the once - *invincible* @entity231 , he says
@entity218 : @entity1 's being ganged up on , but it will stay strong for at least 10 more years
