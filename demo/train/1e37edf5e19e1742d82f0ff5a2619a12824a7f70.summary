@entity0 -- did president @entity2 land a @entity4 peace prize at such an early stage of his presidency simply because he 's not @entity7 ? a " surprised and humbled " @entity2 said he would accept the @entity4 peace prize as a " call to action			1
" diplomatic circles are certainly not dismissing such a notion and a " surprised and humbled " @entity2 has himself agreed that the award ( for which nominations had to be submitted only two weeks after his inauguration ) can hardly have been a recognition of anything he has yet accomplished			1
it is a prize for aspiration rather than achievement			2
one of the best deliberate laughs @entity7 obtained in his last days in office came when he expressed himself pleased at the street reception during his attendance at a @entity25 summit in @entity26			2
" a lot of the crowd were waving ... some of them with all five fingers , " he said			0
@entity7 was acknowledging that many in @entity32 at least could not wait to say goodbye to a man whom they saw as a cold warrior at heart , the president who had led the world into a disastrous intervention in @entity38 and a man heading a gas - guzzling nation who was not prepared to help the world cope with climate change			1
for many @entity44 , the chief concern through the long , drawn - out race for the @entity48 nomination and through the presidential election was that the result should give them anybody but @entity7			1
watch reaction in @entity32 to @entity2 's award they were uneasy about his missile defense shield plans to base @entity58 military installations in @entity59 and the @entity60			1
they felt he had never lived up to his pledge to work as hard on the @entity65 peace process as @entity66 had done on bringing peace to @entity68			0
especially they felt that the internment camp at @entity71 and the " extraordinary rendition " to countries where terror suspects might have been tortured was an affront to democracy which besmirched the reputation not only of the @entity58 but of its allies , too			0
@entity44 were alarmed that @entity7 seemed to be encouraging the climate change deniers			1
and although he became readier to listen to his @entity44 allies during his second term , they never really took to the man whose instinctive response was to use @entity58 's military might in the world 's trouble spots rather than to stay at the negotiating table and who had little time for the @entity90			2
couple that with the words in the @entity93 's citation that the peace prize is being awarded to @entity2 " for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples " and that they have " attached special importance to @entity2 's vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons , " and the message is clear			1
unusually , this is a world statesman being rewarded not for what he has done but for representing a new beginning			0
as @entity111 was quick to point out , the @entity2 presidency is a big signal -- " he has given hope			2
" by commenting approvingly that @entity2 has created a new climate in international politics , with emphasis on the role of diplomacy and of the @entity90 , the @entity93 is clearly encouraging the new president , after just eight months in office , to continue with a style that @entity44 find much more comfortable than that of @entity7 and the neo-conservatives			1
those who worked with @entity7 are likely to feel aggrieved and to maintain that they , too , were working for the extension of democracy for which @entity2 is now being commended			1
as @entity32 digested the news of the prize , nobody wanted to go public with critical comment on a man who is still seen across @entity32 as a beacon of hope			0
but there were off - the - record mutters that this was all somewhat premature			0
cool heads were noting that while intentions have been expressed , there has been no significant progress yet on the @entity65 peace process			0
the proposed closedown of @entity71 has been announced but it has not happened			0
there are still large numbers of @entity58 troops in @entity38 and the numbers in @entity149 are likely to be increased			0
while @entity2 has spoken of his hope of agreeing with @entity152 on a reduction in the number of nuclear warheads , we are nowhere near to seeing an end to nuclear weapons , which are currently in the possession of the @entity58 , @entity152 , @entity159 , @entity160 , the @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164			0
@entity2 may want the @entity165 to ratify the test - ban treaty but that has not happened yet and his moves on climate change , too , will require congressional compliance			2
the truth , say many continental commentators , is that @entity2 deserves a badge for effort -- an effort begun by scrapping the missile shield development in @entity59 and the @entity60 -- but a peace prize is a step too far at such an early stage			1
he is being rewarded not for solid achievement but for creating new hope -- in effect , for not being @entity7			2
it may well be , as president @entity184 of @entity162 has declared , that the award " confirms finally @entity58 's return to the hearts of the people of the world			0
" but some fear that @entity58 's conservatives will take it as a sign of weakness and become more obstructive to @entity2 's aims			1
meanwhile , others are wondering : " what on earth will they give him when he does have a real achievement to point to ? "			0

@entity201 : @entity2 's @entity4 an award for aspiration rather than achievement
@entity44 had hopes that @entity7 's *successor* would be different
@entity4 *committee* said @entity2 had created *favorable* international political climate
some commentators say @entity2 should be saluted for effort but not yet a @entity4
