@entity0 -- to the delight of fans back home in @entity6 , @entity2 drove in six of the @entity8 ' seven runs in their @entity10 - winning victory wednesday and became the first @entity12 - born player to win a series @entity14			1
for much of his career , @entity2 was a star player for the @entity16			2
@entity2 's key role in the series highlights the close ties between @entity20 and @entity12 baseball			1
playing in the @entity8 ' new stadium , the successor to the " @entity24 that @entity25 , " @entity2 's performance brought to mind the key role that @entity27 played in the development of professional baseball in @entity12 , according to @entity30 , author of several books on @entity12 baseball			1
@entity30 became a student of @entity12 baseball in 1993 , when his wife , an attorney , was transferred to @entity12			1
@entity30 , then working on his ph.d. in archaeology from @entity37 , was looking for something to get him immersed in @entity12 culture			1
he wrote to 30 of the greatest @entity12 ballplayers and was surprised to hear back from nearly all of them , with some sending gifts			2
he 's the author of " remembering @entity44 : an @entity47 " and of " @entity48 , " a biography of the first @entity12 - @entity20 to play professional football and the first @entity20 to play professional baseball in @entity12			1
" he was called the @entity51 of @entity12 , " @entity30 said			1
@entity48 led the @entity12 league in batting twice and won the mvp award as a center fielder for the @entity16			2
@entity1 spoke with @entity30 , who is based in @entity0 , on thursday			2
@entity1 : what are your thoughts on @entity2 's key role in the @entity8 ' victory ? @entity30 : it 's wonderful for @entity12 baseball , of course			1
i would say that five years ago , maybe seven years ago , it would have been incredible , because people in @entity20 and in @entity12 were n't sure about the status of @entity12 professional baseball			1
many @entity20 and some in @entity12 thought that @entity12 baseball was n't as good as @entity20 baseball			1
... since then , @entity69 [ @entity70 ] came over , and he set numerous @entity72 records			0
... and then @entity12 won both of the @entity74			2
so @entity12 's baseball has already proven itself to be of high caliber			1
most @entity20 , even if they do n't know the history of @entity12 baseball , recognize now that they play a very good game			1
@entity1 : in @entity12 , how significant is baseball ? @entity30 : it 's the @entity12 national sport			1
it 's been so since the 1890s			0
@entity12 had no native team sports			2
@entity20 and @entity86 teachers introduced team sports to @entity12			1
@entity88 was introduced , along with rugby and baseball			0
baseball is the one that became the most popular			0
in the 1890s , a @entity12 high school team beat a team of @entity20 adults from the @entity97			1
they beat them in three straight games			0
it took on national importance			0
@entity12 , of course , was opened up to @entity104 in the 1850s by @entity106			2
the @entity108 nations were far more advanced in technology , and @entity12 did a rapid modernization			0
by 1890 , @entity12 felt it was ready to join modern nations as an equal , but the @entity108 powers were n't ready to accept @entity12			0
@entity1 : how did the game develop after that ? @entity30 : the biggest change came with two tours			2
the first was in 1931 , an @entity20 all - star team whose big star was @entity121 , and the bigger tour came in 1934			1
both of these tours were sponsored by the @entity126 newspaper			0
in 1934 , they brought over what at the time was considered the greatest baseball team ever			0
it included @entity27 , @entity121 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 was the manager , and we ca n't forget @entity137 , the future spy [ for the @entity20 in @entity138 ]			1
the ' 34 tour was significant for two reasons : the first is that relations between @entity12 and the @entity20 were really rocky at that point			1
there was a very significant treaty , the naval treaty , which limited the size of the major powers ' navies			0
for every five warships the @entity20 and @entity86 could have , @entity12 was only allowed three			1
@entity12 found this quite insulting , even though they had agreed to it in the 1920s			0
when the all - star team went over there , the @entity12 people went crazy			1
half a million people turned out on november 2 for a welcoming parade in @entity6 for the @entity20 baseball team			2
the tour really did create a great deal of goodwill			0
however , that ended quickly			0
within a month of the tour ending , @entity12 announced that it would not renew the naval treaty			2
several months later , in february 1935 , an ultranationalist group tried to assassinate the president of the @entity126 newspaper because he brought over the @entity20 team			0
he was wounded very seriously but survived			0
@entity1 : what was the importance of the tour for @entity12 baseball ? @entity30 : the @entity126 newspaper used the enthusiasm generated by the tour to start their own professional league			1
the first team they created -- to play the @entity20 visitors -- was a @entity12 all - star team called @entity179			1
after the tour , the all - nippon team transformed into the @entity126 [ @entity6 ] @entity16			0
@entity1 : what was @entity27 's role ? @entity30 : @entity27 was credited as the man who helped start @entity12 [ professional ] baseball			1
he sold out every game			0
he had just been released by the @entity8 prior to the tour			2
he hit over .300 ; he led the @entity20 and @entity12 for most home runs			1
@entity1 : how did @entity2 become a baseball star in @entity12 ? @entity30 : he was signed right after high school			1
he was the hero of the annual high school tournament			0
his rookie year was 1993 with the @entity16			0
he spent much of ' 93 in the minors			0
by 1994 , he became a true star , and he was the face of the team from ' 94 till he came over to the @entity8 in 2003			2
@entity1 : how did people feel about @entity2 coming to the @entity8 ? @entity30 : the vast majority of people were very happy for him			1
there was no sense of betrayal except for the true @entity16 fans			0
this was very exciting news			0
i was there when it happened			0
this was a chance for @entity12 's most popular player to prove himself in the major leagues			2
the @entity8 are a special team in @entity12 just like they are in the @entity20 they 're probably the most popular @entity20 team in @entity12			1
when [ @entity214 ] @entity213 first came over in 1995 , i found my @entity12 friends only cared about how the @entity12 players did			0
they were a fan of the @entity218 one day when @entity213 pitched ; they were a fan of the @entity221 when [ @entity223 ] @entity222 pitched , but over time the @entity12 fans became fans of different major league teams as they watched more major league baseball on tv			1
@entity1 : what have been the differences between the @entity20 and @entity12 games ? @entity30 : there were real substantial differences from the 1940s even through the early 1990s			1
... the @entity12 would sacrifice bunt far more than the @entity20 ( they still do but less than they used to )			1
players did n't go first to third on singles often			0
they would play line drives on hops rather than trying to make a shoestring catch and risk giving up more bases			0
it was a very conservative brand of baseball			0
since the ties have become closer , @entity12 's baseball has become more aggressive , more exciting , in my opinion			1
the @entity12 really focus on practice and perfection of the technique			2
that 's something @entity20 players can learn from , and i think it helps explain the success of @entity2 and @entity69			1
they 're both dedicated players who practice many , many hours			0
if you watch @entity2 at the plate , he 's a very disciplined hitter			2
his swing is very compact , very practiced , almost perfect			0
he rarely makes mental mistakes when he 's playing the field or running the bases			0
@entity1 : how do you think people view the fact that he 's going to be a free agent and might not stay with the @entity8 ? @entity30 : i think the @entity12 people would be very disappointed if he does n't remain a yankee ... and i think most @entity0 would be very disappointed , too			1
he 's an extremely classy player and a classy individual			0
@entity1 : were you rooting for the @entity8 ? @entity30 : i 'm a @entity276 fan			2
i grew up in @entity277			0
i 'm in mourning this morning , but at least it was @entity2 who did the damage .			0

@entity12 baseball book author says @entity27 *sparked* professional game in @entity12
@entity30 says 1934 tour by @entity20 all - stars led to first pro teams
he says @entity8 star @entity2 is example for @entity20 ballplayers
@entity30 : @entity2 's *emphasis* on perfecting and practicing technique leads to success
