-- it 's a pod - like structure a bit larger than a photo booth , and a @entity5 company is hoping it will make life a little easier for nursing mothers who are away from home			1
the modular lactation station allows a mother to breast - feed her baby or use a breast pump in a private spot designed with her in mind , with @entity16 surfaces , soft lighting , a fold - down table and even a power supply for a pumping machine			1
the first one was unveiled thursday at @entity22 in @entity5 and the company behind it , @entity22 - based @entity23 , is hoping many more will follow			1
" we definitely see it for any public space where a mom might need some privacy or might want to use a breast pump , " company co-founder @entity26 said			1
nursing mothers know well the challenges of trying to feed their babies while away from home			2
@entity38 nursing covers or shawls allow a degree of privacy when breast - feeding in public , though some mothers who are still shy about it may do it in a corner or even in a bathroom stall			1
mothers who must pump their milk have an even tougher time finding a place to do it in public			2
a bathroom stall is often the only option , but it 's less than desirable -- imagine sitting on a public toilet while balancing a pump ( or baby ) , listening to the sound of flushing toilets all around and knowing other women can hear the kshhh - kshhh of the pump every few seconds			2
those realities became clear to @entity26 after the birth of her daughter seven years ago , when she had to travel for work			0
she had to find ways of pumping while at trade shows , airports , corporate retreats , baseball games and rafting trips , so she began thinking of a product that would make things easier for other mothers facing the same challenges			0
" we wanted it to be comfortable , " she said , but at the same time , " we 're not about hiding moms away			0
we 're about giving them an alternative to pumping in public , and an alternative to using a bathroom			0
" they started working with designers and developed the first prototype earlier this year			0
the director of @entity22 's airport , @entity91 , liked the idea and the free - standing pod is now installed in the second floor of the terminal , airside , after the security checkpoints			2
" breast - feeding is welcome anywhere at the airport , but the @entity103 unit will provide a comfortable place for nursing mothers who might want more privacy ( or for babies who might need fewer distractions ) , " the company said			1
there is no fee to use the lactation station			0
a lock on the door turns red when it 's occupied			0
@entity23 hopes to put pods in other airports or public places like conference centers and malls , @entity26 says			1
they 're also working on a foldable design that could be used in small workplaces and then put away when not in use			2
" what 's been really , really fun for us is the cultural challenge , " @entity26 said			0
as the public becomes more aware of the benefits of breast - feeding , she said she hopes they also become aware of the logistics of it			1
@entity26 said she does n't want women to choose against breast - feeding just because it 's too difficult			1
" we really just want to make it a legitimate choice for women , because really in a lot of cases it just is n't , " @entity26 said			0
" there are so many challenges , so why not make it as positive and optimistic and comforting as possible ? "			0

the kiosk has @entity16 surfaces , a fold - down table and a power supply
it allows mothers to breast - feed or pump *discreetly* while away from home
a @entity5 mother helped design the " pod "
she hopes it can be used in other public places and workplaces
