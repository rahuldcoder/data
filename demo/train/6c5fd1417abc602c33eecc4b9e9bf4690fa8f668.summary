-- not long ago , presidential candidate @entity1 made headlines when he said blacks were brainwashed for not considering conservative ideas			1
on other occasions he declared that racism was no longer a problem and blamed the poor for being poor			2
a personal friend , i know @entity1 to be more thoughtful than those incendiary sound bites , but i also suspect he knew that uttering them would help him land right where he is : atop the @entity16 presidential field , a standing that could be threatened by recent reports of sexual harassment allegations			1
unfortunately , such trash talk -- popular among many black conservatives -- continues to alienate black @entity16 from the @entity23 - @entity22 community			1
during the early ' 90s , when i was a member of the @entity25 editorial board , i had high hopes that the black conservative movement -- to which i was a recent convert -- could help transform black @entity22			1
i penned a number of columns urging the black community to put its vote in play so that @entity33 would have to do something new to keep it and @entity16 would be enticed to go after it			1
for me , the ' 90s was an exciting time for black conservatives			1
having burst on the scene in the early ' 80s during the @entity42 administration , they were everywhere			0
on the far right were free - market conservatives like economists @entity44 and @entity46 , along with establishment types such as @entity48 and @entity49			0
on the moderate side were professors like @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
on the progressive side were voices like community grass - roots intellectual @entity57 and television host @entity59			0
beyond those names , there were a number of other right - leaning black voices , from college campuses to the pulpit			0
black conservatism was the most visible it had ever been since @entity67 peddled self - help capitalism at the turn of the last century			1
but what excited me most was progressive black conservatism			1
rooted in black nationalism and the self - help belief system of @entity76 , it insisted that the black community be at the forefront of solving black problems			0
far from being separatist or pessimistic , it was highly hopeful about @entity22 , recognizing that there was much more opportunity than there were obstacles			1
it was policy - and solutions - oriented , focusing on things like rebuilding the black family , black entrepreneurship , starting and supporting black businesses in poor neighborhoods , enterprise zones , housing vouchers , micro-lending , repealing @entity96 ( a prevailing wage law that unfairly prevented unskilled , often black , workers from gaining apprenticeships on federally funded construction jobs ) , and starting christian schools			0
it was n't wholesale against social programs ; it just wanted to duplicate the successes of those programs -- not necessarily government - led -- that actually worked			0
it did n't deny the existence of racism , but neither did it obsess over it , counting as more important those things over which blacks had control : persistence , hard work , academic exertion , and personal responsibility			2
but progressive black conservatism would never gain traction			2
its lone supporter among white @entity16 -- hud secretary @entity120 under @entity121 -- who pushed a strong urban agenda , was ignored as his party pursued an aggressive suburban strategy that further alienated blacks			1
the tone of black conservatism became even more accommodationist , with progressive voices being drowned out , and never evolved beyond parroting long - held white conservative and neoconservative dogma			1
today 's crop of black conservatives is no different			2
in an environment of runaway corporate greed , where the top 1 % is getting richer at the expense of the middle class , where rising college costs are making many students question the worth of a college education , where unemployment is hovering at 16 % in the black community , where home values are drying up , and the economy is nearly on life support , black @entity16 -- whose spiel is as one - dimensional as it was 20 years ago -- come off as even more tone - deaf			1
their idea of reaching blacks is gimmicky			0
just recently , @entity151 launched ads in @entity153 , @entity154 , declaring , " @entity16 is the @entity155 " and " @entity156 was a @entity16			2
" an article written by @entity159 tea party organizer @entity158 for @entity160 , a national leadership network of black @entity16 , says the tea party could appeal to more blacks if , among other things , it would show @entity165 and @entity166 mingling with african - americans			1
far from being rejected by a black community that is brainwashed , black conservatives have themselves to blame			1
they 've appeared to care more about their own advancement and acceptance in the @entity16 than about truly helping blacks			1
that 's a shame , because we still need a diversity of political ideas			0
if black conservatives really want to make black conservatism a serious force in the black community , they have to drop their " just get over it " philosophy about racism and its lingering effects , stand up to the @entity16 when it does something wrong , and come up with a real urban agenda			1
though i agree with them that it 's not the no.1 problem blacks face today , there 's no denying the fact that structural racism remains interwoven into the nation 's criminal justice , educational and corporate cultures			1
all one has to do is read @entity200 's excellent book , " @entity201 : @entity209 in the @entity210 , " or an insightful article by @entity212 and @entity213 , " @entity220 and the @entity221 , " in the december 2007 edition of @entity215 , to see the impact of racism in the criminal justice system and how darker - skinned blacks are relegated to overall lower socioeconomic status , more entanglements with the criminal justice system , and a reduced chance of holding elective office than their lighter - skinned counterparts			1
a 2003 @entity223 study found that african - americans with black - sounding names were less likely to get called back for job interviews			0
ignoring such evidence robs black conservatives of credibility and moral authority			2
telling blacks , some of whom are poor , desperate and penniless , to just pull " yourselves up by your bootstraps " -- while not at least acknowledging that historically , the boots were rigged , and in some cases they remain so -- is inauthentic and hypocritical			0
if black conservatives want to claim @entity156 , they should at least learn from him			2
during the civil rights movement , @entity156 said he could n't in good conscience tell blacks to lay down their arms in the fight for freedom without speaking out against the @entity245			0
" as i have walked among the desperate , rejected , and angry young men , i have told them that @entity248 cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems , " he said			0
" i have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through non-violent action ; for they ask and write me , ' so what about @entity258 ? ' they ask if our nation was n't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems to bring about the changes it wanted			0
their questions hit home , and i knew that i could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without first having spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today : my own government			0
" @entity156 understood this simple fact : there is no moral authority in attacking the shortcomings of blacks while glossing over the sins of the larger society			0
certainly , black conservatives are right to differ with black liberals about how racism impacts black advancement today			1
i understand what some of them are trying to do : get blacks to stop obsessing over what they ca n't control -- white people 's hearts -- and focus on the things they can			0
still , the argument rings hollow			0
i used to tell my son , " a racist cop may pull you over because you 're black , that 's his fault ; but if he finds drugs in the car , that 's your fault			0
" unlike some conservatives , i do n't wish to let either party off the hook			0
as long as black conservatives appear to be attack dogs for the white establishment , they will always be a weak and ineffectual voice in the black community			2
their views may win them a few elections , sell some books , and earn them the applause of their white counterparts , but it will remain a marginal movement that has no impact in the black community			2
indeed , scarcely any blacks were excited when @entity326 was elected chairman of the @entity328 in 2009 or when rep. @entity329 of @entity330 and rep. @entity331 of @entity332 became the first two black @entity16 to go to @entity333 since @entity334 of @entity335 retired in 2003			1
and while we applaud the chutzpah of @entity1 and his amazing ability to have outperformed so many career politicians , it 's his politics most blacks ca n't embrace			1
bristling under recent reports that he had been the target of complaints of sexual harassment , @entity1 says he 's being unfairly attacked , and i believe he is			2
the man i know has been married for 43 years and his character is unassailable			0
he 's right that presidential politics places a big target on your back			0
i just wish black conservatives understood that being black in @entity22 does too			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity355 .			2

@entity1 said blacks were brainwashed into rejecting conservative ideas
@entity355 : at one time conservatism showed promise as a route for black @entity22
he says @entity1 and others have gained popularity in @entity16 *circles* by trash talk
@entity355 : denying the impact of racism in @entity22 alienates conservatives from blacks
