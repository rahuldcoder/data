@entity1 's brand new moon rover is already saying farewell			1
the diminutive lunar explorer , known as @entity3 , or " @entity3 " in @entity1 , was about halfway through a three - month mission to study the moon 's crust when it suffered a potentially crippling breakdown , said state media			1
the report , authored by @entity1 's state - run @entity11 news , was written in the voice of the rover itself			1
" although i should 've gone to bed this morning , my masters discovered something abnormal with my mechanical control system , " said the @entity11 report , in the voice of the @entity3			1
" my masters are staying up all night working for a solution			0
i heard their eyes are looking more like my red rabbit eyes			0
" " nevertheless , i 'm aware that i might not survive this lunar night , " it added			1
during a lunar night , which lasts about 14 @entity27 days , the moon 's surface temperature can plunge to minus - @entity28			1
to make it through the cold , the lunar rover must " hibernate " to preserve its delicate electronics			2
if a mechanical problem keeps it from hibernating properly , then the @entity3 could freeze to death			2
named after a mythical rabbit who lives on the moon , @entity3 was a source of national pride when it launched into space last december along with the lunar lander @entity42 , named after the moon goddess who kept @entity3 by her side			1
the successful lunar landing made @entity1 the third country in the world to perform a " soft landing " on the moon 's surface			1
earlier , @entity3 and @entity52 survived their first lunar night together , from @entity54 until the second week of january			1
the @entity42 lander successfully entered a second hibernation on friday and is expected to function normally for another year			0
" [ @entity52 ] does n't know about my problems yet , " said the voice of @entity3 in the @entity11 report			1
" if i ca n't be fixed , everyone please comfort her			0
" on social media , thousands of @entity1 internet users sent their well - wishes to the little robot			1
" you have done a great job , @entity3			2
you have endured extreme hot and cold temperatures and shown us what we have never seen , " wrote one microblogger , as quoted by @entity11			0
another wrote : " this is too heavy a burden			0
if the rabbit can not stand again , maybe we should let it have a rest			0
" despite the setbacks , even the little rabbit seemed aware of the odds it had overcome			0
" before departure , i studied the history of mankind 's lunar probes			0
about half of the past 130 explorations ended in success ; the rest ended in failure , " noted the @entity3 in its report			2
" this is space exploration ; the danger comes with its beauty			0
i am but a tiny dot in the vast picture of mankind 's adventure in space			0
" the sun has fallen , and the temperature is dropping so quickly ... to tell you all a secret , i do n't feel that sad			0
i was just in my own adventure story - and like every hero , i encountered a small problem , " said the @entity3			2
" @entity109 , @entity27 , " it said			2
" moon rover launched successfully is @entity112 on cusp of space race ?			1
