@entity0 , @entity1 -- surviving victims and family members of the @entity0 massacre testified in emotional terms monday over their personal trauma and grief , as the sentencing phase for the convicted murderer 's court - martial moved quickly toward a dramatic conclusion			1
a military jury could begin considering by late tuesday whether maj. @entity14 will get capital punishment for the horrific november 2009 shootings on this sprawling @entity18 base			1
the @entity20 officer was convicted friday on all 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the shooting rampage at a @entity0 deployment processing center			1
the incident occurred about a month before @entity14 was to deploy to @entity29			1
" i was expected to either die or remain in a vegetative state , " said staff sgt. @entity30 , who was shot four times , including in the head			1
he recovered , but his left side remains partially paralyzed , and he said monday that he struggles to cope with the injuries			1
" it 's affected every facet of my personality , " he testified			2
" i am a lot angrier , a lot darker than i used to be			1
" twenty percent of @entity30 's brain was removed in the initial surgery , and he has had more than 10 additional procedures			1
he leaves the service in october on medical retirement but said he will never be fully functional			2
prison or death for @entity14 ? it 's up to the jury now prosecutors began presenting the first of 19 witnesses , including a liaison or family member for each victim killed in the attack			1
they began describing the impact the shootings had on their lives , part of the " aggravating " evidence the prosecution will use to try to demonstrate why @entity14 deserves lethal injection			1
a dozen victims and family members took the stand before the court - martial unexpectedly recessed for the day at midafternoon			2
base officials would cite only " logistical issues " for the delay and said the judge was meeting in chambers with @entity14 , who serves as his own attorney			1
the defendant -- who was wounded by military police in the attacks and paralyzed -- repeatedly asked the bench monday to take brief breaks from the public proceedings , but the court offered no explanations			1
during the nearly three - week trial phase , military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence			2
unclear is whether @entity14 himself will now present testimony or speak on his own behalf			1
he serves as his own attorney and has refused to put on a defense in court			0
the @entity94 - born psychiatrist of @entity96 descent has the opportunity to offer " mitigating " evidence that could persuade the panel to spare his life			0
he refused to cross-examine any of the victims and their families testifying			0
@entity103 lost her husband , maj. @entity104 , a 52 - year - old clinical psychologist preparing to deploy to @entity29 when he was gunned down			0
when officials rang her doorbell to inform her of the news , 14 hours after the shooting , " all i could say was , i knew it , i just knew he was dead , because he did not call me back " after the incident			0
@entity111 and @entity104 had three children living in the house at the time , including a 2 - year - old			0
@entity111 testified that her 12 - year - old daughter was distraught , quoting her as saying , " ' @entity118 , i hope who did this understands the pain he has caused all these families			0
' " an older daughter could not cope , became suicidal and remains emotionally troubled , @entity111 said			0
the father of pvt. @entity126 said @entity14 's action 's left him devastated			1
his 21 - year - old daughter was pregnant at the time of the premeditated murders			0
" this man did not just kill 13 people , " @entity131 testified in @entity132			0
" he killed my ( unborn ) grandson , and he killed me slowly			0
@entity137 , 23 , left behind a widow and three small children			0
" we can only imagine " what might have been , @entity142 said quietly			0
" these past few years have n't been easy being a single mother			0
... i miss him a lot , his soft gentle hands , how he held me and made me feel safe and secure			2
" i feel dead , yet i 'm alive , " she added , wiping away tears			0
on his own initiative , @entity14 admitted early in the court - martial , " the evidence will clearly show that i am the shooter			1
" he has also indicated a willingness to die as a " martyr			2
" judge col. @entity156 is likely to instruct the military panel to ignore any direct pleas from @entity14 that he be given lethal injection but to decide punishment only on the facts and testimony presented , in accordance with the law			1
the stakes in the penalty phase create an unusual dynamic in what was already a very unusual case			2
" the @entity94 military is not used to this kind of defendant , who apparently wants to die for his crimes			0
it might take a terrible weight off the jury -- if the inmate wants death , they may say , ' we 'll accommodate			2
' it lessens the burden , " said @entity181 of the @entity182			0
" on the other hand , the military by its nature , and in this time of war , sees a lot of death			1
they may not desire to add to it and give ( @entity14 ) what he may want			1
his wishes might have a reverse effect			0
" but @entity14 's confessed rampage against innocents on a domestic military base will be an important consideration for the panel considering his fate			1
history may not be on @entity14 's or the government 's side			1
the last military execution was in 1961 , and only five servicemen sit on death row at @entity208 , @entity209			2
the military has its own legal standards and procedures when trying and appealing capital cases			0
the @entity94 @entity214 gets the final say , if any petition reaches that far			0
of the 11 military death sentences that have completed direct appeal , nine ( 82 % ) have been reversed .			2
