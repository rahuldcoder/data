@entity0 -- @entity2 is a 21 - year - old student of law at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6			1
she was arrested on may 6 , 2010 , and held in solitary confinement			0
she is not a political activist			0
the reason for her arrest : her sister @entity11 , a poet , blogger and graduate student at @entity14 , is a solid supporter of the @entity15 in @entity6			1
@entity16 became even more vocal since last summer 's presidential election , when her husband , @entity18 , also a graduate student at @entity14 , was arrested in the airport as the couple was leaving @entity6 to resume their studies in the @entity23 he was jailed for more than two months and subsequently released , but not permitted to leave @entity6 to join his wife in @entity14 to resume his studies			1
the authorities in @entity6 evidently arrested @entity2 to force her sister @entity27 into silence in @entity14			2
she did not become silent			0
last week the authorities released @entity29			0
@entity30 is a 24 - year - old student activist from @entity31 in @entity32			0
he has been repeatedly jailed for long periods of time			0
arrested on december 7 , 2009 , during the student protests over the disputed presidential election of 2009 , @entity30 became the subject of global solidarity when authorities in @entity6 sought to humiliate him by taking his picture garbed in mandatory women 's veils			1
almost instantly , countless @entity6 men wore veils and published their pictures on the internet in solidarity with @entity30			2
similarly , when @entity30 went on a dry hunger strike to protest his solitary confinement , his mother , too , initiated a hunger strike in solidarity with her son , which many young @entity6 from around the globe followed			1
the authorities yielded and transferred @entity30 from solitary confinement to a regular ward			0
@entity2 , an apolitical law student , and @entity30 , a major political activist and a pain in the neck of the @entity63 theocracy in @entity6 , are two typical examples of the two ends of the spectrum on which young @entity6 are challenging the 31 - year - old theocracy that has ruled their land			1
the hopes and aspirations of these young women and men -- in a nation where young people make up some 70 percent of the total population -- are now branded a " fetneh / menace " by the loud propaganda machinery of the @entity78			1
fortunately for @entity6 , and fortunately for the world , that old and noisy machinery is n't working			1
@entity2 and @entity30 , and the generation they represent , are in charge of representing themselves and telling the world what they want			0
june 12 , 2010 , is the first anniversary of the election that sparked the @entity15 in @entity6 , a nonviolent civil rights uprising that caught the world by surprise			1
in a region infested with violence -- genocidal , homicidal or suicidal -- it is impossible to exaggerate the significance of a massively popular civil rights movement that has begun and continued with the most fundamental democratic question of " where is my vote ? " it is a seminal question that had never been asked on such monumental scale in any other aspiring democracy in the region			0
with the ring of that simple but resounding question , " where is my vote ? " millions of @entity6 have forced the hand of the @entity78 , exposing its naked brutality			2
if the world were to listen and watch carefully , it would see that the ancient @entity114 theory of democracy ; the @entity117 's cry for liberty , equality and fraternity ; the @entity122 revolt against despotism and tyranny ; and ultimately the @entity125 of the 1950s and 1960s are today all resonating in the @entity6 cry for freedom			1
for daring to doubt the veracity of the official results of last year 's presidential election , innocent citizens have been subject to systematic and unbridled violence by the security apparatus of a theocratic regime that seems to be , more than anyone else , cognizant of its own absence of legitimacy			2
@entity140 and @entity141 , the leading two opposition figures , just canceled their call for a mass silent rally on the first anniversary of the @entity15 for fear of organized state violence against peaceful demonstrators			2
the @entity78 is of course no exception to the rule of state - sponsored violence against innocent civilians in the region			0
against that backdrop , the @entity15 in @entity6 has opened a new and unprecedented chapter in the political culture of the region that old colonial officers branded " the @entity158			1
" violent coups , militant rebellions , military invasions and brute insurrectionary uprisings are the staple of the political culture in this region			0
in a region where the enduring formation of democratic institutions and of nonviolent transition to democracy has always been thwarted by the rise of one charismatic tyrant or another , from @entity173 to @entity174 , the @entity15 boasts no such leader			2
and it is teaching those who care to watch an entirely new lesson in the art and craft of small steps and careful coalition - building on the long and arduous path to democracy			0
by contrast , the @entity184 's claim to moral superiority has been undermined by the continued carnage in @entity188 and @entity189 , both still effectively under @entity122 - led occupation , and of @entity192 's wanton disregard for the humanitarian crisis in @entity194			2
what 's a little torture in @entity197 and @entity198 over the last year compared to what the @entity122 has done in @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 in the course of its " war on terror " over the last decade ? the @entity122 has invariably supported undemocratic regimes to safeguard its immediate interests , compromising its longstanding ideals and principles			1
today , @entity6 demonstrators braving brutal repression in their streets and on their rooftops are truer to the ideals and aspirations of @entity216 and @entity217 than those in positions of power and authority in the @entity122			1
one can scarce imagine a more urgent issue facing the @entity122 than the possibility of an @entity78 achieving nuclear arms			0
but is president @entity226 a credible leader to force @entity6 to stop its nuclear ambition when he continues with the double standard of never bringing @entity192 or @entity230 , two nuclear power allies of the @entity122 who are not even signatories to the nonproliferation treaty , to the negotiating table ? the @entity15 is providing president @entity226 with a historic opportunity to show the courage of his imagination and opt for regional and ultimately global disarmament , predicated on a nonviolent principle that community organizers ( he must remember that term ) in @entity6 seem to have learned from @entity217 more earnestly than he has			1
one year later , the @entity15 is unfolding in multiple and varied ways , and nothing will stop it			0
it may thunder as a cascade or flow quietly on a plateau -- but like any other bountiful river it will not stop until it reaches its destined ocean			0
from the gracious patience of @entity29 in solitary confinement in a @entity5 prison to the noble anger of @entity30 counting days to his people 's freedom in a cell in @entity198 , the young @entity6 are teaching nations the very alphabet of a language of liberation that the world leaders are yet to learn			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			0

@entity264 says young people continue the fight for freedom in @entity6
he says @entity15 is marks its anniversary as it survives repression by regime
@entity15 embodies ideals of freedom from @entity122 *revolution*
he says @entity122 policy in region is n't living up to @entity122 's own ideals
