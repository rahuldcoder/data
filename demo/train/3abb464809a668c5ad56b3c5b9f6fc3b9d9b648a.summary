for thousands of prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine charges , the prison doors will be opening early , thanks to sentencing changes easing the disparity between the penalties for possessing or distributing crack vs. powder cocaine			1
@entity9 passed the @entity10 in august 2010 , changing the 100 - to - 1 disparity between minimum sentences for crack and powder cocaine to 18 to 1			1
the @entity14 voted this summer to make the reduced crack penalties retroactive , which means more than 12,000 current inmates are eligible to request reduced sentences			1
the retroactivity took effect tuesday			1
the @entity14 estimates that inmates will have an average of three years chopped off their sentences			1
an estimated 1,800 inmates became eligible for release immediately because they had already served enough time , and prosecutors did not object to their release			1
critics of the old sentencing system say it was unfair to african - americans , who make up the majority of those convicted of possessing and distributing crack			1
" this really has been one of the great stains on our federal criminal justice system for 20 years or more , " said @entity35 , the federal public defender for the @entity36			2
" this disparity between the punishment for crack cocaine and powder was really unjustified			0
" @entity35 noted under the old guidelines someone who had just 5 grams of crack cocaine would receive a mandatory minimum sentence of five years			2
but someone would have to have 500 grams of powdered cocaine to receive a similar sentence			0
@entity35 's district is believed to have the largest number of people in the country -- between 800 and 900 people -- who might benefit from the reduced sentencing guidelines on crack			2
he said 75 of his clients were expected to be released on the first day of retroactivity			1
" a lot of people have been sitting in jail for a long time not because they did n't commit crimes , but because the punishment they faced was too harsh and unjustified compared to other people who had committed similar crimes in similar ways , " @entity35 told @entity61			0
he said reduced sentences will not be automatic			1
judges must review the cases and determine whether an early release of an inmate represents a danger to the community			0
@entity78 , a @entity79 man convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in 1997 , was one of those released tuesday			1
i 'm ecstatic , " @entity78 told @entity61			0
" the 39 - year - old father of four said he only found out monday he would be released the next day			1
under the terms of his original sentence , he would have been eligible for release in october 2018 , and that sentence was reduced a few years ago so that his revised release date was june 2014			2
@entity78 , who identified himself as an @entity90 , said there seemed to be a racial component to the different sentences given out in the past for crack and powder cocaine , but he said he would n't describe himself as bitter			1
" i do n't have time for it , " said @entity78			0
he said he 's concentrating on catching up with family members and making plans to go into business cleaning office buildings			0
@entity102 has fought for changes in mandatory cocaine penalties for years			0
" most mandatory sentences are so high and so rigid that judges ca n't get around them , so people are going to prison for extraordinarily long times , way beyond what they need to learn their lessons , " said @entity102 spokeswoman @entity105			0
but even with the changes , there is still an 18 - to - 1 disparity in sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses			2
@entity35 said now a person with crack will have to have 28 grams before triggering a mandatory five - year minimum sentence			2
but the person with powder cocaine still must have a much larger amount -- at least 500 grams			0
" ultimately the right answer is 1 to 1 , and people in the law enforcement community and the criminal justice system recognize that , " said @entity35			0
" but that just means that there 's still more work to do			0
