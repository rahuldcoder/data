-- @entity3 will not send its partially enriched uranium abroad to be turned into material for medical research , its foreign minister said wednesday , rejecting a key plank of a deal designed to ease international fears that @entity10 aims to build nuclear weapons			1
foreign minister @entity14 said @entity3 might allow its nuclear material to be reprocessed inside @entity3 , the semi-official @entity13 news agency reported			1
the deal hammered out last month with the help of the @entity18 ' nuclear watchdog agency aimed to reduce the amount of raw material @entity3 has to build a nuclear bomb			1
@entity10 denies that it wants to do so , saying its nuclear program is to produce civilian nuclear energy and do medical work			1
the watchdog @entity25 said wednesday that it could not confirm or deny that @entity3 had rejected any part of the proposal			1
@entity29 spokesman @entity28 said , " this is the @entity25 's proposal , and @entity3 has to give their response to the @entity25 , and that 's what we 're waiting for			1
that 's what the @entity25 is waiting for			0
" but , he said , " until the @entity25 gets the response and formally says this is ... @entity3 's response , i do n't consider a statement to the press necessarily a response			1
" on october 1 , the @entity25 proposal " was accepted in principle by all the parties including @entity3 , " @entity28 said			1
" and there was also an agreement that each of the parties would provide a written response to the proposal			1
" @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54 have provided a written response , " he said			1
" we expect @entity3 to provide a written response			2
and we expect the @entity25 to pronounce on that response			0
so we will wait for the @entity25 to make a formal response to this			0
" in a report published monday , the @entity25 expressed concerns about @entity3 's nuclear program			1
the @entity65 republic 's disclosure of a previously secret nuclear facility near @entity67 raised questions about the existence of other such facilities , and its delay in acknowledging the facility " does not contribute to the building of confidence " in @entity10 , the @entity25 said in the report			0
@entity10 has not convinced the agency its nuclear program is n't military , said the report , published on the @entity79 web site			2
a source with direct knowledge of the report confirmed its authenticity to @entity0			0
@entity10 shocked the international community in september by revealing the existence of the nuclear enrichment facility			0
on monday , @entity28 said in a statement that the report " underscores that @entity3 still refuses to comply fully with its international nuclear obligations			1
" @entity25 inspectors visited the newly revealed facility last month , according to the report			0
during a meeting in @entity10 , @entity3 officials told the inspectors that construction of the site had begun during late 2007 , the report said , and it would not be operational until 2011			2
however , the @entity25 inspectors told @entity3 that " it had acquired commercially available satellite imagery of the site indicating that there had been construction at the site between 2002 and 2004 , and that construction activities were resumed in 2006 and had continued to date , " the report said			2
@entity25 member states also allege that design work on the facility , the @entity101 , began in 2006 , the report said			0
@entity3 officials told inspectors that the nation has no other undisclosed nuclear facilities either under construction or in operation , the report said , and promised that any future facilities would be disclosed			1
a letter sent this month asks @entity10 to confirm that it has not decided to construct or authorized construction of any undisclosed facility , the report said			0
@entity3 remains bound by the terms of a 2003 agreement under which it must provide information to the @entity25 regarding nuclear facilities as soon as the decision to build is made or construction is authorized			1
" even if , as stated by @entity3 , the decision to construct the new facility at the @entity125 site was taken in the second half of 2007 , @entity3 's failure to notify the agency of the new facility until september 2009 was inconsistent with its obligations , " the @entity25 said			2
@entity18 secretary - general @entity128 has said construction of the facility violates @entity131 resolutions , @entity28 said			2
" @entity3 's delay in submitting such information to the agency does not contribute to the building of confidence , " the report said			2
" while the agency has confirmed that the plant corresponds to the design information provided by @entity3 , @entity3 's explanation about the purpose of the facility and the chronology of its design and construction requires further clarification			0
" the agency is waiting for @entity3 's reply to its request to meet officials in regard to those issues and others , according to the report			0
" further analysis of the information available to the agency underscores the importance of @entity3 engaging with the agency in a substantive and comprehensive manner , and providing the requested access , so that the remaining outstanding issues may be resolved			0
" the agency encouraged @entity25 member states who have provided it information on @entity3 to share that information with @entity10 as well			0
@entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			0
