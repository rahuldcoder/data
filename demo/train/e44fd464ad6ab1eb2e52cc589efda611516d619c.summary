-- with @entity3 @entity2 and @entity4 back in the @entity3 , the big question now is why did @entity6 leader @entity5 agree to their release ? is it a sign @entity11 wants better relations with @entity13 ? is it sending a message to its closest ally , @entity17 ? or is it a bid to shift the focus off its human rights record amid talk @entity23 could be charged with crimes against humanity ? " i think right now there is a charm offensive , " @entity29 , the author of " @entity30 : @entity6 takes on the world , " told @entity0			1
something in @entity11 , @entity29 believes , sparked the offensive			2
but just what stemmed the change is highly debated			0
this much is clear : @entity6 's release of @entity2 and @entity4 on saturday came amid a rare , last - minute trip by a top @entity3 official -- director of national intelligence @entity38 , to @entity11 , a senior @entity41 official told @entity0 on condition of anonymity			1
@entity38 , who was tapped by president @entity45 as an envoy , made the trip after @entity6 urged the @entity3 to send a cabinet - level official , the official said			1
@entity38 is not a member of @entity45 's cabinet			0
he is the government 's spy chief			0
the official said there were no discussions about @entity6 's nuclear program , and other @entity3 officials told @entity0 there was no " quid pro quo " for the men 's release			1
" i do believe it 's a positive sign , " @entity61 , a former @entity3 ambassador to the @entity62 who tried to win @entity2 's release during a 2013 visit to @entity6 , told @entity0			1
with @entity6 " catching a lot of grief " on its human rights record in the @entity62 , @entity61 said it appears @entity11 is sending a message that " we 're ready to talk			1
" the secretive nation has been slapped with crippling @entity62 sanctions			2
it has previously used negotiations surrounding its burgeoning nuclear program to get needed aid , such as food			0
' there may be a number of reasons ' but @entity82 , a former @entity41 official who negotiated with @entity6 , believes the release of @entity2 and @entity4 had very little to do with " a desperate cry for help			1
" " there may be a number of reasons why @entity6 may have released the two @entity3 now , " he said			1
it could be as simple as @entity6 made its point			2
" these people were put in jail for a certain amount of time , and now they can be released , " he said			0
or it could be that @entity23 is " communicating to @entity17 ... that @entity11 is trying to be reasonable , and the @entity3 is not			1
" @entity82 said it also could have something to do with @entity6 's effort to tamp down the possible fallout from a scathing @entity62 @entity101 report cataloging @entity6 's abuses that the investigators said amounted to crimes against humanity			1
" i think there is no doubt in the minds of anyone who follows @entity6 closely that @entity5 is in charge			2
there 's no doubt about that , " @entity82 said			0
@entity23 , who took over as the absolute leader following the 2011 death of his father @entity116 , personally ordered @entity2 and @entity4 released			2
early hopes that the younger @entity23 would be open to warming relations with the @entity118 were quickly dashed after he took a series of provocative steps , including threatening a preemptive nuclear strikes			0
he has since come to be viewed as more unpredictable , more dangerous and harder to read than this father			0
@entity123 , who served as the head of the @entity3 delegation in failed talks aimed at curbing @entity6 's nuclear ambitions , also doubted the release of the two men was a good - faith gesture			1
" he has not shown any sign of living up to what his father agreed to , which is to do away with his nuclear program , " he told @entity0			0
asked whether there was any substance behind the so - called " charm offensive , " @entity123 said , " it 's really kind of early to tell			1
" human rights allegations the release of @entity2 and @entity4 comes a month after @entity6 officials appeared to go on the offensive , taking questions at the @entity62 , arranging human rights talks with the @entity146 and taking a high - level trip to @entity148			1
it was an abrupt about - face for @entity6 , which only a year earlier had conducted an underground nuclear test and threatened attacks against @entity148 and the @entity3			2
in return , the @entity62 slapped additional sanctions against @entity6 , further isolating the secretive nation			2
the sanctions have cut off @entity6 's ability to trade with most of the world			1
the so - called charm offensive appears to have coincided with the release of a @entity62 commission report that accused @entity6 leaders of a pattern of human rights abuses that " does not have any parallel in the contemporary world			1
" the commission said it would refer its findings to the @entity168 , also known as the @entity168 , for possible prosecution			0
it also sent a letter to @entity23 warning he could face prosecutions for crimes against humanity , and warned of other options , including the possibility of being tried before an ad hoc tribunal by the @entity62			2
in order to charge @entity23 or other @entity6 leaders , the move would have to be approved by the @entity180			0
if the matter escalates to that level , @entity17 -- a permanent member of the council -- has indicated it likely will veto it			0
@entity17 and @entity6 have been close allies , since @entity17 backed the @entity6 in the @entity187 in the 1950s			0
the @entity3 supported the @entity148 in the conflict , fighting side by side with its troops			0
the two koreas are still officially in a state of war , though an armistice signed in 1953 ended the bloodshed			0
@entity0 's @entity196 contributed to this report .			0

@entity6 's **''** charm offensive **''** coincides with release of @entity62 report
@entity6 has released @entity2 and @entity203
there are questions about why @entity11 freed the @entity3
@entity6 *analysts* and *experts* are *divided* over why it took the step
