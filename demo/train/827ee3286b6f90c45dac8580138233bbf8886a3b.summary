a @entity1 artist and designer has come up with a device he hopes will suck pollutants from @entity6 's smog - cloaked skies , creating columns of clean air for the city 's surgical - mask wearing residents			1
an electromagnetic field generated by copper coils will pull airborne particles in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned			0
" it 's like when you have a balloon which has static ( electricity ) and your hair goes toward it			0
same with the smog , " says artist @entity25			2
his studio has reached an agreement with the @entity6 government to test the technology in one of the capital 's parks			1
with its skies regularly shrouded by filthy gray smog , @entity6 this week unveiled a series of emergency measures to tackle the problem			1
@entity25 says an indoor prototype has already proven it works and is confident the results -- with the help of a team of scientists and engineers -- can be replicated outside : " @entity6 is quite good because the smog is quite low , it 's in a valley so there 's not so much wind			1
it 's a good environment to explore this kind of thing			0
" " we 'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get the top of the smog so you can see the sun again			2
" @entity25 acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem , rather than a viable solution to @entity6 's dire air pollution			1
" this is not the real answer for smog			0
the real answer has to do with clean cars , different industry and different lifestyles			0
" however , he hopes the project will make a " radical statement " by allowing the city 's residents to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog - filled air			1
" i want to take a park in @entity6 , 50m by 50m square , and make it the cleanest park in @entity6 , " he says			2
he is still discussing with local authorities which park will be used			0
@entity25 's studio has worked on several projects that use static electricity in unusual ways ; creating a road that charges electric cars and a floor that generates electricity when danced on .			0
