-- the @entity1 on friday ordered @entity3 nuclear power plants to begin implementing safety recommendations made in an effort to prevent a crisis from occurring as it did in @entity7 after last year 's devastating earthquake and tsunami			1
among the recommendations , plants must install improvements to protect safety equipment and devices to monitor water levels in spent fuel pools			2
a third order applies only to plants with boiling - water reactors that have so - called @entity21 or @entity22 containment structures			1
@entity21 containment housing is the same design that was used at @entity7 's @entity26 nuclear power plant , where three reactors melted down after the station was struck by the tsunami that followed @entity7 's historic earthquake in march 2011			1
the disaster resulted in the widespread release of radioactive contamination that forced more than 100,000 people from their homes			0
the disaster occurred when a 15 - meter ( 49 - foot ) tsunami inundated the coastal plant , knocking out the cooling systems for the three operating reactors and their associated spent fuel pools , causing the reactors to overheat and hydrogen gas explosions that blew apart the building housing reactors no. 1 and 3			0
another hydrogen blast is believed to have damaged the inside of the no. 2 reactor , while engineers were struggling to manage an estimated 100,000 tons of highly contaminated water that was used to cool the reactors during the emergency			0
" these reactors must improve venting systems that help prevent or mitigate core damage in the event of a serious accident , " the @entity1 said in a news release announcing the orders for @entity3 plants			2
in addition to the changes in safety procedures , the @entity1 is also seeking information from every operating @entity3 nuclear power plant regarding risks caused by earthquakes and flooding and the plants ' emergency procedures in the event of prolonged power loss			0
the plants have until the end of 2016 to fully comply with the safety orders , according to the @entity1 .			1

plants have until 2016 to comply with orders
the recommendations were made after last year 's disaster in @entity7
one order involves plants with structures *similar* to that of @entity26
