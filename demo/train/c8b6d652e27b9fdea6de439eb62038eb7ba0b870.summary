-- the backslapping and congratulations over the @entity4 bailout deal is still underway , and i realize it is not good form to criticize a deal when the ink has yet to dry on the agreement			1
perhaps we should be delighted that it only took a disgraceful bank levy to be thrown out by a nation 's parliament , a week of bank closures with the chaos that brought , and the inevitable sunday midnight meeting with everyone beaten into bleary - eyed exhaustion			0
and come to think of it , why ca n't the @entity21 ever agree something during the day , without everyone having to lose a night 's sleep ? the radical and immediate crises have been averted by the closure of one of @entity4 ' two largest banks and " haircuts " on large bank deposits			1
the @entity4 bank system will survive minus one shoddy institution that is best gone and a restructuring of the rest -- if that ever happens			1
the date of 2018 has been set for the banking sector to be shrunk to the @entity21 average , so do n't hold your breath ! i have no doubt this was the best the leaders could do , in the time they had , to avoid @entity4 ' economic collapse and exit from the euro			1
but i 'm afraid this agreement is nothing more than the usual euro nonsense , beautifully coined in the @entity52 statement after the deal was announced : " the @entity4 authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to step up efforts in the areas of fiscal consolidation , structural reforms and privatisation			1
" @entity61 : @entity4 faces tough road ahead hang on			1
where have we heard that before ? oh yes			0
@entity65 after its first bailout			2
and @entity65 after various troika reviews which found , time and again , that few companies had been privatized , that structural reform was bogged down and that fiscal consolidation means all austerity and no growth			0
the unpalatable truth is that @entity4 , even after taking â ‚ ¬ 4 billion of depositors ' money as part of the bailout , will still be left with an unsustainable debt load at a national level			1
the @entity52 has lent the country more than 50 % of its gdp			0
worse , as @entity21 commissioner @entity83 admitted , is that @entity4 is heading into an even deeper recession			1
the country has shrunk for the past two years and has probably two more to go			0
all the woes that have been visited on @entity65 are now about to be experienced by @entity4 too , and it was all agreed in the middle of the night , in a hurry			1
@entity4 was the victim of being the fourth sovereign to be bailed out			1
even though the @entity52 is making this up as they go along , there are now some common threads which can be seen in the way crises are being handled bondholders and shareholders in banks can no longer expect to be left alone			2
they tried that with @entity65 and @entity102 and failed ( although in the @entity102 case the banks eventually did have to be merged and closed )			2
now the new normal is that investors should expect to be bailed in to agreements			0
large depositors will also bear their share			0
no longer should @entity108 banks be regarded as " safe " beyond their deposit insurance limits			1
anyone with â ‚ ¬ 100,000 in a bank account should be on guard			0
do n't think it is unusual to have such large sums in bank account -- i know of several organizations and businesses who keep such sums as part of cash flow in the bank			0
northern countries like @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and company are now determined to take a hardline approach , and they do so because of bailout fatigue from their voters			0
but let 's see if that line crumbles when a really big @entity108 country , like @entity136 or @entity137 , gets into trouble			2
in each bailout we have seen the bark of an agreement , but we have yet to see the bite of the eurozone 's determination to force countries into change			0
@entity108 leaders are so terrified their political project will fail that they cobble together these deals in the middle of the night , and then wonder why the whole thing fails to materialize 18 months later			2
take december 's eurozone banking union deal , for instance , which was agreed to with an unrealistic timescale and is still some way off from actually happening			0
despite the deal being agreed to four months ago , there remains the very real problem of civil unrest as a result of high unemployment in a number of euro countries , and there is mounting disquiet within the union			2
forgive me , i suppose i should be celebrating the @entity4 deal			1
but it 's hard to be thrilled when all i see are crises avoided , not problems solved .			0

quest : @entity4 bailout deal is crisis averted , not problem solved
@entity4 will still be left with an unsustainable debt load at a national level
new normal is @entity108 banks are n't " safe " beyond deposit insurance limits
