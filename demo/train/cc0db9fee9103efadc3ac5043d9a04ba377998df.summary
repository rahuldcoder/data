time : life up close with @entity65 the world watched and waited as the lunar module " @entity76 " separated from the command module and began its descent			2

" about six and a half hours later at 10:56 p.m. et on july 20 , 1969 , @entity1 , at age 38 , became the first person to set foot on the moon			1

" the quote was originally recorded without the " a , " which was picked up by voice recognition software many years later			0
@entity1 was on the moon 's surface for two hours and 32 minutes and @entity62 , who followed him , spent about 15 minutes less than that			1
the two astronauts set up an @entity2 flag , scooped up moon rocks and set up scientific experiments before returning to the main spacecraft			2
all three returned home to a hero 's welcome , and none ever returned to space			2
the moon landing was a major victory for the @entity2 , which at the height of the @entity109 in 1961 committed itself to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely before the decade was out			2
it was also a defining moment for the world			0
the launch and landing were broadcast on live tv and countless people watched in amazement as @entity1 walked on the moon			1
" i remember very clearly being an 8 - year - old kid and watching the tv ... i remember even as a kid thinking , ' wow , the world just changed , ' " said astronaut @entity123			0
" and then hours later watching @entity1 and @entity62 take the very first step of any humans on another planetary body			1
that kind of flipped the switch for me in my head			0
i said , ' that 's what i want to do , i want to be an astronaut			0
' " tributes to @entity1 -- who received the @entity137 in 1969 , the highest award offered to a @entity2 civilian -- poured in as word of his death spread			1

they set out to show the world that the @entity2 spirit can see beyond what seems unimaginable -- that with enough drive and ingenuity , anything is possible			0
" @entity159 presidential candidate @entity158 said the former astronaut " today takes his place in the hall of heroes			0
with courage unmeasured and unbounded love for his country , he walked where man had never walked before			0
the moon will miss its first son of earth			0
" house speaker @entity172 , from @entity31 , said : " a true hero has returned to the @entity174 to which he once flew			0
@entity1 blazed trails not just for @entity2 , but for all of mankind			1

" @entity1 was born in @entity184 , @entity31 , on august 5 , 1930			2
he was interested in flying even as a young boy , earning his pilot 's license at age 16			0

in 1971 , he resigned from @entity33 and taught engineering at the @entity205 for nearly a decade			2
while many people are quick to cash in on their 15 minutes of fame , @entity1 largely avoided the public spotlight and chose to lead a quiet , private life with his wife and children			1
" he was really an engineer 's engineer -- a modest man who was always uncomfortable in his singular role as the first person to set foot on the moon			1
he understood and appreciated the historic consequences of it and yet was never fully willing to embrace it			0
he was modest to the point of reclusive			0
you could call him the @entity226 of the astronaut corps , " said @entity222 , an aviation expert with @entity224 ' @entity223 , formerly of @entity0			0
" he was a quiet , engaging , wonderful from the @entity230 kind of guy			0
... but when it came to the public exposure that was associated with this amazing accomplishment ... he ran from it			0
and part of it was he felt as if this was an accomplishment of many thousands of people			0
he took the lion 's share of the credit and he felt uncomfortable with that , " said @entity222			0
but @entity1 always recognized -- in a humble manner -- the importance of what he had accomplished			2
" looking back , we were really very privileged to live in that thin slice of history where we changed how man looks at himself and what he might become and where he might go , " @entity1 said			1
