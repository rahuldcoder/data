-- for the first time in more than 60 years , @entity1 is without a @entity3 on the national stage and it 's more than just a sentimental loss to president @entity7			1
the coffin of senator @entity3 is carried by an honor guard			1
the last of the @entity3 brothers , senator @entity3 , died this week of brain cancer at age 77			1
" we should n't underplay the adverse effect this has on the president 's healthcare fight , " said @entity15 strategist @entity14			1
@entity3 was the youngest of four brothers , the only one who died peacefully			2
@entity22 , was elected to @entity23 in 1947 , then the @entity24 in 1960 and assassinated in 1963			0
brother @entity25 was running for president when he assassinated in 1968			0
their eldest brother , @entity27 , was killed years earlier in @entity29 there are too many surviving children and relatives to count			0
a few have been in public life , but none of them fully profits from the family 's nearly mythical place in the @entity1 imagination			1
@entity3 diminished his own share of that inheritance			2
he had a well - known fondness for drink in his early years and in 1969 , he drove off a bridge with a young woman in the passenger seat			0
he swam to safety ; she drowned			0
@entity3 persevered and went on to a 47 - year career as a prominent and productive member of the @entity50			1
his early endorsement of @entity7 helped @entity7 win the @entity24			2
after the victory , the new president needed his help for something more			0
for decades , @entity3 was an ardent advocate of reforming the @entity1 healthcare system			1
@entity7 has made it the centerpiece of his administration			2
but support for the plan is slumping across the country and in @entity23 as well			0
the rules of the @entity50 normally require 60 votes to pass legislation without impediment from the opposition			2
now the @entity15 are down to 59			0
" the @entity24 is worried about getting 60 votes , " said @entity0 analyst @entity68			0
" he was very important to healthcare reform in many respects , not least of which was his vote			1
" already some @entity15 are saying that his death could actually help win the reforms he wanted			0
they see him still as an ally in the effort , absent but inspiring			0
can the @entity15 fill the hole left by @entity3 's death ? sound off below but the president needed his respected voice , his veteran 's skill at negotiating a deal and , of course his vote			1
@entity7 will miss him .			1

@entity3 's death marks end of a *dynasty* in @entity1 *political* life
