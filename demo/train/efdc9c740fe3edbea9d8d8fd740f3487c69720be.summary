the 50 - foot christmas tree decorating downtown @entity1 , @entity2 , was supposed to spread holiday cheer , but instead it made some residents unhappy			1
" it looks sad , " @entity6 president @entity5 told @entity9 affiliate @entity7 last week			1
" everybody 's calling it a @entity14 tree			2
" a group called @entity16 for @entity1 raised $ 1,000 from business and community donations toward purchasing a replacement tree , but a last minute change of heart means the original tree that was denigrated far and wide on the @entity22 will stay in place			1
@entity5 had earlier vowed to replace the tree that observers called " pathetic , " " ugly " and an " embarrassment			1
" the puny @entity28 spruce had already lost many of its branches , even though it 's not yet december , and it was sparsely decorated with a simple string of lights			0
" if there was a squirrel looking for a place to live in the winter , it would n't even go into the tree , " remarked one passerby			2
city workers arrived monday to remove the lights and prepare the old tree for transport to @entity44 to make room for a newer , better tree			0
but @entity5 granted the tree a last - minute reprieve , according to @entity7 , saying he now wants to leave the tree that has gained so much notoriety in place as a draw for visitors to the downtown area			1
" we will keep this thing here and we will call it the ' ugly tree ' that everyone and national television is calling it , and we 're going to see it as an opportunity to bring people to downtown @entity1 , " said @entity5			1
he told @entity7 that letting the old tree stay put would free up municipal workers to prepare the city for a coming snowstorm			0
@entity5 is soliciting more donations to help decorate the tree better			0
the new tree is still being delivered and will be on display elsewhere in the city , say officials			0
the debate over whether to replace the tree is annoying some residents even more than the " ugly " tree did			0
" it 's frustrating that they ca n't make a decision on their own and go with it , " @entity1 resident @entity81 told the local news station			2
" we ca n't afford to just be sending these [ public works ] guys here			0
there 's a lot of other stuff these guys need to be doing , and we want to complain about this tree when there 's other parts of the city that are nowhere near as pretty as this tree , that people do n't find any beauty in			2

*update* : @entity1 , @entity2 , will keep the christmas tree some called " ugly " downtown
the " @entity14 " christmas tree originally did n't live up to a @entity2 city 's *standards*
city *council* president @entity5 helped raise money to replace the tree
" the city *deserves* having a beautiful , good - spirit @entity16 , and we 're *gon* na offer that "
