-- a @entity5 couple faces an agonizing wait for the birth of their baby boy to a surrogate , some 14,000 kilometers away , in a country now under military rule that 's changing the laws mid-way through the pregnancy			1
the parents , who have asked not to be named , have never met their surrogate , who they chose from a photo and profile supplied by a clinic in @entity19			1
" we are not allowed to have direct access to the surrogate , ( to ) talk to her ...			2
but we are in contact with our agency that has kept us up to date even in the midst of all that has been happening , " they said in an email to @entity0			0
what 's been happening is an unprecedented crackdown on a lucrative industry that has flourished in the absence of rules and regulations			2
in recent weeks , @entity19 authorities have raided a number of surrogacy clinics , closing some down and throwing hundreds of couples into a legal and emotional maelstrom			1
" the thing that has helped me cope with all the uncertainty is my faith and the hope to have a baby , " said the intending mother from @entity5			2
hundreds of confused couples families through @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , a non-profit organization that helps intending parents through the process , says there are currently around 400 couples with pregnant surrogates or frozen embryos in @entity19			1
around half are from @entity57 , with many others from the @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , said @entity50 founder @entity62 , who has been inundated with calls from around the world from worried parents			1
" many clinics are being run on a skeleton staff , or staff working from home			0
as a result it 's very hard for parents to contact their clinics , " @entity62 said			2
" we want to assure parents that their surrogates are being looked after			2
they should n't panic , they should n't try to contact their surrogates direct			0
this is a difficult time but clinics are doing all they can to ensure those existing pregnancies are looked after , " he said			0
draft laws approved the recent police raids have exposed the extremes of surrogacy in @entity19 , including the case of a 24 - year - old @entity89 man suspected of fathering at least 12 surrogate babies because he wanted " a big family , " according to his lawyer			1
the industry had already been subject to international scrutiny following the case of baby @entity97 , a seven - month - old boy with @entity98 whose parents left him with their @entity19 surrogate , while taking his twin sister home to @entity57			1
it was later revealed the children 's father , @entity105 , was a convicted pedophile			0
change in the industry was already underway , with the announcement by @entity19 's military government in late july that clinics would be reviewed to ensure they were abiding by the @entity112 's code of conduct			1
" people have been operating on a pretty informal basis and the risk has always been that that would change , and change very quickly			0
so in that sense the worst fears of legal professionals like myself have come to bear , " said @entity118 , a surrogacy expert from the @entity119 in @entity120			2
last week , the interim @entity125 approved a draft law to make commercial surrogacy a criminal offense			1
it 's unclear when it will be formally approved by the @entity131 and endorsed by the @entity132			2
@entity62 told @entity0 it 's unlikely people in current arrangements will be charged			0
" the @entity19 government has assured us in recent days that there will not be penalties for those in current arrangements , whether they be surrogates or intending parents			1
( but ) there will be a new process for exit from the country , " he said			0
babies stopped at airport in the last few days , @entity19 immigration officials have stopped two couples -- from the @entity59 and @entity57 -- from leaving the country with their newborn babies			1
police major general @entity154 said both had been allowed to leave after presenting a missing document			0
" @entity19 authorities are now more rigorously enforcing documentary requirements upon exit of the country when they suspect a child has been born of surrogacy in @entity19 , " said a spokesman from the @entity57 @entity158 ( @entity158 )			1
a spokeswoman from the @entity59 @entity166 said : " we are aware of reports of cases where the parents were not permitted to exit , and we are seeking clarification about @entity173 requirements			0
" @entity154 told reporters on tuesday : " if all documents are right , there will be no problems			0
" legal limbo couples with pregnant surrogates are now expected to have to seek a @entity182 ruling before they 're able to take their newborns out of the country -- a process that could take up to six months			0
" it 's been three to five weeks in the past			0
it 's a huge increase , " @entity62 said			0
the extra costs and delays are an unexpected blow for couples who have already spent thousands of dollars on surrogacy services , but there 's little they can do			1
" going early to @entity19 would serve no purpose , and we would not know who to lobby anyway , " the hopeful @entity5 mother said			2
" we are not rich			0
we have regular jobs , and like most people , we only have so much vacation time to use to get our baby and take care of the legal requirements to take our baby home			0
" end of @entity19 surrogacy ? already , people who may have sought surrogacy in @entity19 are looking elsewhere , @entity62 said			1
" @entity210 and @entity211 are very viable possibilities now for same - sex couples , singles and de facto couples			0
" the options will be discussed at a conference in @entity218 , next month , when families through @entity49 will also be calling for mandatory criminal checks worldwide on intending parents , to avoid a repeat of the outrage that followed the case of baby @entity97			1
" at the moment , some @entity59 clinics do ask for criminal checks on parents , but it 's the least that can be done by clinics to protect their reputation , as well as protect the babies who 'll be born , " @entity62 said			2
it 's likely the @entity19 crackdown will lead to a sharp drop in foreign parents seeking surrogacy in the country			1
however , @entity62 says he does n't think that it 's the end of the industry in @entity19			1
" there is going to be surrogacy in the future , but brokers or intermediaries wo n't be allowed			0
basically it looks like it 'll only really be possible if you arrive with a local @entity19 person or you 're bringing a surrogate in from another country with you			1
