a senior judge told the state - run @entity13 that all detainees in the city under the " laojiao " or @entity9 system would be released by the end of the year			1
" the police and many legal experts have realized the drawbacks of laojiao and called to abolish the system , which has become outdated , " @entity18 , deputy president of @entity19 , was quoted as saying			2
" many of those released from laojiao find many difficulties returning to society , families and work after ... their personal freedom has been restricted in labor camps for several years			0
" @entity4 still has about 100 people in labor camps , he said			1
@entity35 welcomed the move but said there were few @entity9 camps and detainees in cities			2
it estimates @entity7 has as many as 18,000 detainees held in a network of facilities throughout the province			0
despite the move to end the process -- originally aimed at reforming offenders through a mixture of hard labor and @entity52 indoctrination -- @entity35 claims the changes are merely cosmetic and work camps have simply been relabeled drug detox centers			1
how it started reform through @entity57 was set up in the 1950s under @entity59 and modeled on the @entity61 " gulags " -- a place where " counter-revolutionaries " and " class enemies " could be detained without trial			1
millions are believed to have died through overwork , suicide and harsh conditions until the system was overhauled in the 1970s when @entity71 released prisoners accused of political and religious offenses			0
according to the latest available figures from the @entity76 of re-education through @entity57 under the @entity78 , 160,000 people were held in 350 re-education through labor centers nationwide as of the end of 2008			2
the @entity82 says the figure is possibly as high as 190,000 people			0
today the system empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing			1
public criticism of the system has grown in @entity3 where petitioners against official corruption , " subversives , " such as @entity99 practitioners or those simply finding themselves on the wrong side of powerful @entity103 figures , have also been sentenced to penal labor without trial			1
in a brief note in the official @entity109 last week , the vice president of @entity4 , @entity107 , said the city 's administrative courts had ceased hearing @entity9 cases in march , effectively scrapping the system			1
" judicial reform of @entity9 has been a priority this year , " @entity107 told the @entity109			0
" @entity4 has stopped approval of re-education through labor ( cases ) further highlighting the protection of citizens ' personal liberties			2
" an administrative tribunal official @entity124 added that with no new detention cases being heard , the system would eventually be " digested out " but that specific reforms would be a matter for other relevant departments			2
in january this year , the central government in @entity131 strongly hinted that it would begin scrapping the system although @entity4 's announcement is the strongest indication yet that concrete steps have been taken			1
cosmetic changes while @entity7 province has a reputation for being progressive and reform - oriented , human rights groups are skeptical about the depth of change to the controversial jail system			1
@entity143 , a senior researcher at @entity35 told @entity1 that reforms may simply be a cosmetic re-branding of an otherwise repressive system			1
" @entity7 is at the vanguard of reform , that 's their identity , " @entity143 said			0
" unfortunately , this ' reform ' essentially consists in changing the signboard at the labor camp from 're - education through @entity57 ' to ' @entity154			1
' " he said @entity7 had been ready to move fast because the majority of the @entity9 detainees in the province -- 10,000 out of a total of 18,000 according to @entity35 â € ” are drug offenders or users who posed little political threat to authorities in @entity131			1
" it 's not entirely clear to us what has become of the 8,000 @entity9 detainees who are not being shifted to the detoxification system			2
some may have been shifted to yet another system of administrative detention , ' @entity171 , ' designed for people suspected of engaging in sex work or of having hired the services of sex workers , " @entity143 said			2
these centers , @entity35 argues , also constitute arbitrary detention because deprivation of liberty results from administrative , rather than judicial , decisions			1
" in other words , no trial , no lawyer , no appeal			0
and the conditions in these centers are consistently abusive , " he added			0
he said that while it was encouraging that local authorities had stopped admitting new detainees while they awaited more concrete reforms from @entity131 , the central government could reverse its proposals at any stage			0
" as far as @entity35 is concerned , the only way forward is to put a definitive end re-education through labor , not to shift detainees to another arbitrary system of detention , or establish a new system to warehouse minor offenders , petitioners , government critics , sex workers and offenders below the age of 18 , " @entity143 said			1
backlash over exposed cases two high - profile cases that became public last year generated a massive backlash , forcing the government to address the thorny issue of @entity9			0
in one case , a mother was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp for " disrupting social order " after she repeatedly petitioned officials to execute men convicted of raping her 11 - year - old daughter			0
in another case , a young village official was sent to a labor camp for two years for re-tweeting @entity224 posts that were deemed seditious			0
while even @entity7 's progressive administration has stopped short of attacking the system , saying that it was " not opposed to the use of coercive power and punishment by public security organs , " recent official announcements have offered guarded criticism of @entity9			2
" the system was designed to maintain social order , prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code , " read one @entity234 editorial			0
" it did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods , however , with the development of society and the legal system , its defects have become more and more evident			0
" @entity249 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 's third city @entity4 announces first steps in unbolting 're - education through @entity57 ' system
system was set up in the 1950s under @entity59 and modeled on the @entity61 ' gulags '
it provides for detention without trial for petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers
@entity35 says the changes to the system , however , are only cosmetic
