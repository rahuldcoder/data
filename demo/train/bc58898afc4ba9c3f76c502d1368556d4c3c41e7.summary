-- the " @entity8 " might sound like the next @entity2 blockbuster , but @entity4 's latest plan to revolutionize international football caused nothing but confusion when it was announced thursday			1
the game 's @entity10 governing body has stepped up its attempt to bring more prestige to friendly games , creating more opportunities for countries to qualify for the 2020 @entity18 finals and the @entity19 in @entity20			1
but it has left journalists and fans bamboozled , with nobody seemingly able to explain just quite how the tournament will work -- even @entity4 admits the format " has not been finalized			1
" instead , social media was awash with doubts and more questions than answers over the new system , which was given the go - ahead at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			2
set to commence in september 2018 , the competition will involve all 54 member nations , with four divisions of 12 - 14 teams divided into four smaller pools			1
the top - ranked teams will be in the first division , and the lowest - ranked in the last			0
the winner of each mini-pool will then meet at a neutral venue in june 2019 , and the overall division winner automatically qualifies for the @entity48 finals			2
it would mean that one of the weaker nations from @entity52 would be guaranteed a place at the tournament			2
the remaining 20 qualification places for @entity48 will be decided through the usual qualifying process , with games played from 2019 , possibly going on as late as march 2020			0
there is the possibility that a team may reach the @entity8 playoff final having already made it through to either the @entity19 or @entity18 finals			1
in that case , the place would be allocated to the country finishing immediately below in that division			0
it is also thought that two of @entity4 's 13 qualifying places for the @entity19 may also be decided via the top two divisions of the @entity71			1
while fans across the world wrestled with a potentially exciting concept bereft of any definite detail , @entity4 recognized the new venture as a " big step for national teams in @entity4			1
" " we accept and respect that all @entity4 member associations have agreed to create a new competition , " @entity79 , chairman of @entity4 's national teams competition committee , said in a statement			1
" this is a big step for national teams in @entity4 and we hope that fans will support the new format			2
" the idea has been warmly welcomed by some , including the @entity89			0
" the prospect of @entity94 playing three or four teams from the best 12 or 16 countries in @entity4 on a home and away basis should be very exciting , " @entity89 general secretary @entity90 told his organization 's website			2
" it means we will go from a major tournament such as a @entity19 straight into a set of three international double - headers between september and november that will really mean something			1
" there will be the threat of relegation too , so there will really be something at stake			0
" the @entity110 , which represents the 214 teams from across the continent , believes the move is a positive one			0
" a positive aspect of this new concept is that our players will no longer have to travel around the world for friendly matches , " @entity110 chairman @entity115 said			0
" i am not worried about the @entity121 ; it is a prime product and the @entity123 as well will continue to flourish			0
" but there are concerns from @entity126 , the world players ' union , which believes the new format may place too much strain on players			0
leading nations have often used friendly games to blood new talent , work on new tactics and give an opportunity to players to stake their claim for a regular starting place at major tournaments , with multiple substitutions taking place throughout contests			2
that may now change , according to @entity144			0
" as we understand , the @entity71 will be another prestigious competition , " he told @entity126 's website			1
" as a consequence , that implies an increase in the workload for the group of top players			0
