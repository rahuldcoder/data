-- " @entity1 : @entity4 - @entity3 " director @entity2 has come up with a nostalgic way to reveal the names of the movie 's characters			1
we 've known for months that " @entity3 " features fresh faces like @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			0
we even got to see them in action in the movie 's first trailer , which was released the day after @entity18			0
but the lingering mystery was who exactly those actors are playing			0
now , thanks to some clever retro - style trading cards , we know the names of their characters			1
@entity3 is with the new ' @entity1 ' trailer @entity2 teamed up with @entity27 president @entity26 to create a set of trading cards that are a callback to the ones issued with " @entity1 " debut in 1977			1
the cards , which were unveiled by @entity34 , do n't tell us a lot ; we pretty much just get a name and a small description			1
hate the new lightsaber ? @entity39 shows why you 're wrong in other words , let the speculation begin			0
according to the cards , @entity13 , the x-wing pilot seen in the first trailer , is playing someone named @entity46			2
we do n't know whether he 's a good guy or a villain , but that name is n't exactly friendly			2
@entity11 , the actor seen at the start of the trailer stressed out in his stormtrooper suit , is playing someone named @entity53			0
his card acknowledges that he 's " on the run , " which might fuel speculation that @entity11 's wearing @entity58 gear as a disguise			0
and @entity12 , the actress we see speeding through a desert landscape in the trailer , is playing a character named @entity63			2
earlier this year , rumors circulated that @entity66 's character was called @entity67 on set			2
in addition to those three , @entity2 also revealed the name of the cloaked figure wielding that heavily debated new lightsaber : that character is @entity74			1
plus , we also learned that the little rolling droid at the beginning of the trailer is called @entity79 , which @entity34 suspects will be as sweet as it looks			0
that 's all @entity2 has shared for now , but we 're still a long way off from " @entity3 ' " release date			1
the movie is set to bow on december 18 , 2015			0
@entity86 has n't seen the new ' @entity1 ' trailer			1

@entity2 has revealed names of some " @entity1 " characters
he used old - *school* trading cards to do so
the cards do n't reveal much other than the character names
