-- for sheer inspirational value , it will be hard to top one of this fall 's new tv series , " the @entity6			1
" the beloved actor , now 52 , is returning to prime - time television tonight in his first starring role since 2000 , when he abandoned " @entity14 " at the height of its popularity to deal with his worsening @entity13			1
the physical challenges posed by his medical condition have n't kept @entity19 from taking on a number of recurring and guest - starring roles on tv in recent years , most notably on " @entity24 , " " @entity15 " and " @entity25			1
" but to play the lead in a weekly series requires an effort on another order of magnitude , as @entity19 readily admits			1
" it 's a lot of hard work , but it 's been satisfying , " he said sunday at the @entity31 , where he paid tribute to the late @entity33 , the producer behind " @entity14 " and the show that launched @entity19 to fame , " @entity34			1
" parkinson 's disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement , and currently , there is no cure			1
those who suffer from the disease may have difficulty speaking and may experience cognitive issues			2
read more about @entity13 's @entity19 acknowledged that embarking on a new series was something of a risk			1
" it 's been a learning experience to see what i can do ( physically ) now and what is difficult for me to do now , " he said			2
" i did n't give myself credit for being capable of doing ( a regular series )			0
and it 's been great			2
" on the @entity60 sitcom , @entity19 plays @entity61 , a prominent @entity63 news personality who put his career on pause after he developed @entity13 's			1
when @entity61 decides to go back to work , his family is surprisingly relieved to have him out of the house			0
it 's part family comedy , part workplace comedy , in a sense combining the key elements of both " @entity34 " ( and its homey @entity75 family setting ) and " @entity14 , " which mostly took place in the office of a fictional @entity63 mayor			2
his character 's condition is a primary source of humor in " the @entity6 , " at least in the pilot episode			1
in one scene , @entity61 's problem with muscular control causes him to dial 911 by mistake			2
he explains to the 911 operator , " my meds have n't kicked in yet			0
" ( in a subsequent scene , cops respond to the 911 call			0
after determining there is no emergency , one of the officers recognizes @entity61 and says , " since we 're both here , could i get you to sign an autograph ? my uncle 's got @entity102 's			2
" @entity61 responds , " i 've actually got @entity13 's			1
" the cop says , " either way			0
" ) @entity19 insists , however , that his sitcom will not amount to a series of @entity13 's jokes			1
" it 's in the first couple of episodes , but we taper off as we go along , " he told @entity108			2
" but it 's what the character lives with , based on stuff from stories i told the writers			2
... it can potentially take three minutes to get a spoon of eggs from here to there			0
there is no particular meaning to that , it 's just fact			2
and when you deal with that fact , it 's funny			1
" dealing with @entity13 's , of course , has n't always been a barrel of laughs for @entity19 , who was diagnosed in 1991 at the age of 30 ( he did n't publicly reveal his condition until 1999 )			1
in fact , in a new interview with @entity140 , the actor admitted he began drinking heavily after struggling to cope with the disease			2
" i used to drink to party , " he said on @entity140 's radio show			1
" but now i was drinking alone ... every day			0
" he said therapy helped get him out of the depths of despair and to a realization that he could live with the disease			2
" it all started to get really clear to me , " he said			0
that clarity involved resuming his acting career , albeit on a more modest scale , and becoming involved in fundraising for @entity13 's research			1
he also became a champion of stem cell research , injecting himself into the contentious politics of the issue , which earned him rebukes from some conservatives ( including @entity160 , who once accused the actor of exaggerating his @entity13 's symptoms to curry sympathy )			1
with his new sitcom , @entity19 has gone back to the future -- to the medium that made him a household name in the 1980s			1
his co-star @entity168 , who plays @entity19 's boss on the show , said @entity13 's has not dulled the actor 's comedic gifts			1
" i see him as a great athlete , " he said			0
" sometimes i see him just rein in the physicality of a symptom or whatever but at the same time focus on the scene			0
... he has n't lost anything			0
he has n't forgotten how to do it			0
" @entity168 said no special accommodations have been made to @entity19 due to his illness			1
" he goes through a normal day ( on set ) , " he said			0
" as with any series , you have long days			0
you 've got to be prepared for them ; you 've got to rest up ; you 've got to do your homework			0
he does all of that , which makes it even more extraordinary , because he has to take care as to how he budgets his energy , his time , to do the work			0
" @entity19 says that if anything , @entity13 's has actually made him a better actor			1
in the current issue of @entity200 magazine , he said he learned not to rely on the kind of physicality that had been his calling card			0
" when that was taken away , i found that there was other stuff that i could use , " he said			0
" that hesitation , that @entity207 affect , is an opportunity to just pause in a moment and collect as a character and respond to what 's happening and just gave me this kind of gravitas			2
" that gravitas will be on display for the full 2013 - 14 season			0
@entity60 made the highly unusual commitment to order 22 episodes up - front , the price it apparently had to pay to prevail in a network bidding war for the show			1
@entity168 said @entity19 has earned it			1
" he was deserving of a full season order , because he has demonstrated that he has the star power to deliver , " he said			0
@entity19 and his co-stars have shot several episodes , with many more ahead			2
as for how it 's going , the actor said it 's so far , so good			0
" it 's been great , " he said			0
" the cast is great , and the writers are great			0
it 's been a good experience			0
" does he see what he 's accomplishing as inspirational ? @entity19 wo n't come right out and say it , but he hinted as much to @entity200			1
he told the magazine that in the back of his mind , he 's aware some people might be inspired to see a person with @entity13 's return to full - time work			1
" another side of it that i do n't deal with every day but is certainly present , is that on some level , it might be empowering for people			0

" the @entity6 " *premieres* tonight on @entity60
@entity19 left tv in 2000 to deal with his @entity13 's disease
the disease is played for laughs on the new show
