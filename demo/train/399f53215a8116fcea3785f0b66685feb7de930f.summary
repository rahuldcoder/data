-- outside my window , the wind is starting to die down , although it still comes through in gusts , sending branches and debris tumbling down the deserted street outside			1
the power 's been out since 4 a.m. life has skidded to a slow crawl , with no data available on my smartphone and no internet to tell me when the storm might subside			2
it 's just me inside my shelter , listening to the howl of the weather and racing to eat everything in the fridge before it spoils and has to be tossed into a garbage bag			2
some people in @entity25 party before a storm starts or even after it begins			1
young voices hollered and whooped down the street last night , kids running through the rain with bottles in their hands			2
in the meantime , i stood on the porch as the wind started to pick up			2
@entity37 photos luckily , i made sure to charge up all my laptops before the power went out			1
in the dark , i sit in front of a rectangular glowing screen , a reminder that my separation from technology is only temporary until someone comes and repairs the lines			2
soon , i 'll be connected to the world again			2
for now , i send texts from time to time , just to make sure others are ok , to let them know i am thinking of them as we sit in the darkness listening to the world outside			2
some might describe the feeling that comes with waiting for a hurricane to arrive as fear , anxiety or anger			1
to me , it 's not quite any of those things			2
it 's closer to surrender			1
growing up , my grandmother told me stories of @entity69 that engraved themselves on my memory			1
in their home on @entity74 in the @entity75 , they stayed put when they heard that weather was coming , with none of the advanced ways to communicate about the threat of a storm that we have now			1
@entity25 : the food that got them through when @entity69 hit in 1965 , my grandmother watched as the floodwaters gushed from the floor furnace in the hallway of their home , spilling across the living room floor			1
i listened , frozen in awe , as she described to me those first moments of panic , how everyone stood there and watched it , the long seconds before my mother screamed with fear			2
they made a mad scramble into the attic , listening to the wind batter the walls of the house as the water slowly rose up the stairs			2
when it drew too close , my uncle chopped a hole in the roof so they would n't drown			0
they used a bedsheet to tie themselves together so they would n't fall after they made their way out into the wind			0
luckily , right before they climbed out of the hole , the rain stopped			0
i grew up not with a fear of hurricanes but rather a conviction that they had to be dealt with using a mix of careful planning and complete concession to the whims of nature			1
those vivid images from my grandmother 's stories never left me			1
she was a figure of courage to me , a devoted survivor			0
a love letter to @entity138 when @entity140 destroyed the home where my mother and grandmother raised me , we were lucky enough not to be in it			1
they were evacuated to the @entity146 in the @entity147 and were there for days without power			0
later , my mother described to me how the entire building shook from side to side while the winds tore through the city			0
she smiles now when she tells the story , because she knows how close it was , how fortunate they were to be airlifted out in the end			0
i moved to @entity158 not long after the storm , leaving @entity25 and my own flooded apartment behind me			1
the majority of what i owned was destroyed			1
since i did n't have the capability to deal with what had happened , i chose to run in the other direction			0
but now i 've returned			1
my grandmother never sought help for her post-traumatic stress symptoms after @entity69			0
in a way , i could n't blame her			0
it was unspoken between us , but i knew there was something about that kind of grief that was both a secret and a treasure			0
admitting it meant admitting how much life had hurt you			0
it was easier to carry it silently			0
as i watched @entity37 draw up the mouth of the @entity183 on the same august day that @entity140 did seven years ago , i felt a sense of calm			1
i 'm calm still as i sit in the dark , looking at the frayed electrical wires dangling from the poles outside the window			0
that 's how a hurricane feels to me			1
it 's coming face to face with something of great power , and knowing it 's ok to be small and vulnerable in the face of it			0
from my parents ' experiences , i know you can fight these things			0
i also know you can choose to accept them absolutely rather than struggle			0
if @entity37 had been a stronger storm , i would have left			1
after so many years of hurricanes , you start to develop the same feel for them that a farmer does when he licks a finger and sticks it in the air to find out which way the wind is blowing			1
monday night , as i walked home , the breeze was gentle and lovely , like a missive sent in advance of @entity37 's arrival			1
i 'll be there soon , it said			0
but you 'll withstand me			0
have you been through a natural disaster ? share what helped you weather the storm in the comments section below .			0
