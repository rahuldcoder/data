-- @entity2 - based promotions company @entity1 is threatening to move one of its biggest events , the annual @entity6 festival , out of @entity7 if the city goes through with a proposed admissions tax , according to the @entity10 the report comes after the newspaper obtained a series of text messages in which @entity1 vice president @entity15 told an @entity7 official about the plans to move @entity6 and also its country music festival , @entity19 , from the city			1
" if the tax initiative of putting $ 4 million to $ 6 million onto @entity6 gets on the ballot , " @entity1 president @entity21 told the @entity22 , " we 're going to take off [ in ] 2014 ; 2015 we 'll be at a new facility outside of @entity7			1
" the 5 - to 10 - percent tax on admissions for events of more than 2,500 people was initially proposed by city councilman @entity31 , who believes that the cost would add an average of $ 18 to each ticket			1
@entity31 belives this would generate $ 4 million for @entity7 , which recently had to cut almost $ 4 million from its budget through layoffs and leaves of absence			1
@entity21 , however , estimated that the tax would make tickets approximately $ 36 more expensive , a cost he did not want to make festivalgoers pay ; the tax , then , would cost @entity1 an extra $ 4 to $ 6 million			1
after his initial measure was turned down by the @entity46 , @entity31 is now leading a petition drive to get the measure on the ballot in november			1
approximately 2,700 @entity7 residents would have to sign the petition for it to go forward			2
it was @entity31 who forwarded the texts that @entity55 sent him to the @entity10 the texts indicated that @entity1 was already planning on moving the two festivals out of @entity7			2
one read , " you know were moving right ? all this is a game			2
why in the world would we stay where we are not wanted			2
" [ @entity64 ] while @entity21 said he could n't respond to the texts because he had not seen them , he noted that some excerpts -- like one about how @entity1 decided to move two years ago -- were misleading			2
he did acknowledge that @entity1 had attempted to buy the @entity69 just down the road from the current site of the @entity72 , not the @entity72 as @entity55 's text read			0
" we 've spent money on options for new venues , " @entity21 told the @entity10 " i regret that , but i had to			0
there 's too much uncertainty			0
in any other place , this festival would have had a long - term deal			0
we have it with the venues			0
with the city , it 's been this year - to - year thing			1
" while @entity55 's texts indicate that @entity1 has n't had any meetings with @entity86 officials to discuss a long - term deal " because there is n't one , " @entity7 mayor @entity88 said otherwise			0
city manager @entity95 added that negotiations wo n't be able to begin until the city knows what will happen with the tax proposal as well as @entity1 's possible purchase of @entity101			1
while both @entity21 and @entity72 owner @entity103 say they want to keep the festivals where they are , they ca n't ignore the effects that @entity31 ' proposed measure would have			1
before any decisions are made , they 'll have to see how many signatures @entity31 ' petition gets			0
" @entity31 , his slogan should be , ' i want to turn the city of festivals into the city of festival ' â € ” the @entity113 , which is free , " said @entity21			0
" that 's what he 's doing			0
" while @entity6 2014 remains uncertain , dates for next year 's festival have already been set for april 12th - 14th and april 19th - 21st			1
