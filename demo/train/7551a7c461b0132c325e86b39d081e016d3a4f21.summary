on a dusty , remote ranch across the @entity2 from this @entity4 border town , an intimidating drug lord stood over 13 - year - old @entity5 and handed him a gun			1
@entity7 did n't know who the man was , but it was clear he instilled fear and commanded respect among everyone standing around watching the dramatic scene unfold			0
the @entity16 teen had never before met anyone who carried a pistol adorned with such an unforgettable decoration : the number " 40 " encrusted in diamonds on the handle			1
the cartel leader looked at @entity24 and ordered him to shoot and kill a man tied up on the ground			2
if he refused to murder the stranger , @entity7 recalls , the drug lord would have killed him			1
@entity5 's career as a teen drug cartel assassin had begun			1
" i knew that my life had just changed forever , " @entity7 told @entity31 this week , 11 years later			0
" that 's a day that i 'm never going to be able to forget			0
after that , i did n't have no life			0
" @entity7 's boyhood friend @entity36 says he started his life as a criminal by stealing cars and selling them across the border in @entity41			1
he graduated to smuggling drugs and weapons across the @entity2			0
@entity36 says it was n't long before he also became a drug cartel assassin			1
@entity7 and @entity36 agreed to give @entity31 rare interviews from the @entity4 prisons where both men are serving life sentences for murder			1
they offered a first - hand glimpse inside the sinister world of drug cartels , a world that plagues innocent people on both sides of the border			1
the mysterious drug lord who ordered @entity7 to shoot the stranger at the ranch that day , @entity7 says , was @entity62			1
for years , @entity62 was the unrivaled leader of the ruthless @entity64 drug cartel until police arrested him last month just outside @entity66 , @entity41			1
@entity62 , 40 , faces charges of organized crime , homicide , torture and money laundering , a @entity41 government security spokesman told reporters in july			1
there were at least seven warrants for his arrest			0
many @entity78 leaders often use numbers as their cartel nicknames			2
on the streets of @entity41 , @entity62 was known as " @entity62			1
" one of the most feared and powerful drug kingpins in the world , @entity62 took drug cartel brutality to never - before - seen levels			1
@entity41 and @entity16 law enforcement agencies accuse @entity62 of killing hundreds of people while laundering hundreds of millions of dollars			1
although @entity62 virtually ruled northern @entity41 without fear , as @entity7 came to know him he began to see @entity89 as a regular guy			1
@entity7 watched others respond to @entity62 's tough leadership			1
@entity62 had built control and protection systems to insulate his organization at every level from law enforcement agencies and politicians			1
to make a point , sometimes @entity62 sent messages along with decapitated corpses of rival cartel members , said @entity7			1
" absolute control , " @entity7 said of @entity62 's power			1
" in a gun battle , in a confrontation , he 's the first one to get out of his truck and lead his people			0
he 's not going to ask people to do something that he 's not willing to do himself			0
that 's why a lot of people follow him			0
" entering the narco world ' lifestyle ' @entity7 , 24 , and @entity36 , 26 , still bear signs of their years as feared assassins			1
@entity7 has bizarre markings around his eyes ; @entity36 has drawings of eyeballs tattooed on his eyelids			1
a large image of " @entity126 " -- or @entity126 -- marks @entity36 's back			1
denounced by @entity41 's @entity128 , @entity126 is a popular symbol among drug traffickers			1
@entity31 was first to broadcast the police interrogation videos from which the world first learned about @entity7 and @entity36 , sparking worldwide fascination with both men and making them infamous legends of a narco world			1
@entity36 and @entity7 grew up on @entity136 in @entity66 , just a few blocks from the city 's largest border crossing checkpoint			1
over the years the ramshackle neighborhood has developed into a discarded border region where homes sit on dilapidated foundations and families live under crumbling rooftops			0
@entity7 was one of 10 children and @entity36 was one of five boys whose father disappeared early in his life			1
" on the border , a lot of people get dragged into this lifestyle , " @entity7 said			0
" but what we fail to see is that we do it to ourselves			0
" @entity7 was a young boy headed down the wrong path			0
he had followed two friends to the ranch across the border where he was ordered to kill for the first time			0

when @entity7 arrived at the ranch , it was a crash course in drug cartel culture			1
" they were torturing people and getting information from them , " said @entity7			0
" i could n't believe what i was seeing			0
people getting tortured , killed , decapitated			0
it was kind of hard to believe			0
" @entity36 was also making a name for himself at that time , and impressing the same narco leaders			2
if eyes are a window into the soul then unraveling the myth of @entity36 gets complicated			2
and like everything in the violent world of drug cartels , unraveling truth and myth seems fleeting			2
on the surface , @entity36 's eyes belong to a baby face			2
if you know nothing about him , it 's hard to imagine he could have been a lethal assassin			0
but then there are those eyes tattooed on his eyelids			0
when you see those , they seem like the window into the cold , calculated soul that made @entity36 a notoriously effective killer for the @entity64			2
@entity36 smiled when asked how many people he remembers killing for the @entity64			1
" i have no idea , " @entity36 said			2
" it 's a violent world			0
" after some prodding , @entity36 estimates he probably killed close to 30 people in less than two years			2
@entity36 and @entity7 say they were paid thousands of dollars a week just to be available -- ready at all times to answer the call to kill			1
when orders from cartel leaders came , the men would begin hunting their prey			2
opinion : horror wo n't end with cartel leader 's arrest it 's hard to pinpoint just how much money they were paid			2
@entity36 claims he was spending more than $ 10,000 a week			1
the men say cartel leaders provided them with a house and extravagant cars			2
@entity36 was often seen driving around town in a @entity225			2
for each ordered hit , they said , they were paid an extra fee -- about $ 10,000 , and sometimes even more depending on the importance of the targeted victim			1
the money and lifestyle were so seductive and intoxicating that both teenagers dropped out of school and started living the high - rolling , lavish lifestyle			0
@entity7 dropped out sixth grade ; @entity36 left school in ninth grade			2
" it gives you that sense that you could do anything without being touched and having that sense of power , " @entity36 said			2
" you think that it 's not going to end because it just keeps coming			0
" in interrogation videos made shortly after his arrest in 2009 , @entity7 told a @entity66 police detective how killing made him feel like " @entity251			0
" related : @entity16 teens were hit men for @entity41 cartel the job of a cartel assassin is n't one most people grow old and retire from			1
they either end up in prison , or it 's likely their tortured corpse will be left along a blood - soaked path to nowhere in the @entity41 countryside			1
@entity36 and @entity7 did n't last long in that world			1
they each say they lived the life for about three years , @entity36 from age 16 to 19 ; @entity7 , from age 13 to 16			2

he was sentenced to more than 80 years in prison			0

it was real hard for me			0
i was n't living my life			0
" for his part , @entity36 is not as remorseful			2
