-- earlier this week , @entity1 , the founder of @entity2 , published his top 10 trends for 2012			2
and while @entity6 's list is characteristically prescient , it misses one trend which i suspect will increasingly shape our attitude toward technology over the next year			0
so let me add an 11th trend of 2012 : next year , we will become increasingly preoccupied with the relationship between new digital technologies and employment			1
2012 will be the year that it finally dawns on us that more digital technology might mean fewer regular jobs and that robots could be replacing human beings as the critical labor constituency of our " new economy			1
" @entity6 's own @entity2 website gave us a sneak preview of this revolution in august when it reported on the decision of @entity27 , @entity29 's @entity28 manufacturer , to replace a large part of its workforce with one million robots			0
and in 2012 , i predict , these kinds of strategic investments in artificial intelligence -- from consumer products like @entity29 's @entity37 and @entity39 's self - driving car to automated industrial factories -- will become ever more commonplace			1
next year , we will also see an increasing debate about the connection between new technology and jobs			1
this is a debate that will particularly focus on the impact of digital technology on average workers			1
it will pit what we might call " innovation fundamentalists " against " innovation skeptics			1
" @entity54 , @entity39 's former ceo and its current executive chairman , is a classic example of an innovation fundamentalist			2
" innovators create millions of jobs in @entity68 , " the multi-billionaire mogul told @entity0 's @entity59 last week on @entity60 about what he believes is the inevitably positive impact of new technology , particularly information technology , upon employment			2
but even though innovation fundamentalism remains the core orthodoxy in @entity71 , not every digital mogul shares @entity54 's faith in the magical impact of innovation on jobs			1
last month , for example , at the @entity79 , the debating society of @entity78 , we got a sneak preview of the kind of debate about our digital economy that we will become ever more resonant in 2012			1
" this house believes that the average worker is being left behind by advances in technology " , the @entity79 debate -- a part of the annual @entity71 comes to @entity78 conference -- was framed			2
and among those arguing that the average worker is , indeed , being left behind by technologyl were innovation skeptics like @entity95 , the billionaire co-founder of @entity96 and two distinguished @entity98 economists , @entity99 and @entity100			1
" the androids are coming and they work even cheaper than the @entity28 do , " argued @entity101 in the @entity79 debate			2
he went on to explain that the combined @entity68 labor force of @entity106 , @entity29 , @entity107 was less than 150,000 workers -- a number , he explained , that was smaller than the average number of people entering the @entity68 workforce each month			0
@entity101 then warned the @entity78 audience about the cloud - based storage company @entity116 , the so - called current " darling " of @entity71			1
he said @entity116 was bringing in $ 270 million in revenue from 40 million users and yet employed only 70 people			0
not surprisingly perhaps , the @entity79 motion was carried by a more than 3 to 1 margin			0
@entity123 and @entity101 are also the co-authors of " @entity125 : how the @entity126 is accelerating innovation , driving productivity , and @entity129 , " a controversial new e-book which argues that the creative destruction of today 's digital revolution is actually leaving millions of people behind			1
while they are argue that technological innovation is certainly making us more productive , it is not , they worry , either raising average @entity68 income or generating more jobs for average workers			2
it 's important to note that skeptics like @entity123 and @entity101 are n't luddites and " @entity125 " is distinguished by a substantive final chapter which outlines a series of a prescriptions and recommendations of what needs to be done to more effectively combine technological innovation and jobs			1
proactive education , entrepreneurship and investment policy are the keys to guaranteeing that new technology will produce more jobs for average workers , the @entity98 economists write			0
i have to confess that i share the concerns of entrepreneurs like @entity95 and economists like @entity123 and @entity101 about the impact of new technology on average workers			0
like them , i worry that dynamic new global companies like @entity116 , @entity106 and @entity39 do n't require the labor of average workers			0
i thus welcome the debate about technology and labor that we are about to have in 2012			2
traditional media 's decline is our loss in his excellent summary of 2011 , @entity1 argues that " the pace of change has become blisteringly fast , with traditional industries -- bookstores , video - rental chains , newspapers -- crumbling more quickly than we could have imagined			1
" yet while @entity185 is right to describe the pace of change in 2011 as " blisteringly fast " , he is wrong to suggest that nobody imagined the " crumbling " of old media industries like @entity190 video rental stores and @entity192 bookstores			0
indeed , one of the most impressive of this year 's non-fiction books , @entity195 's " free ride : how digital parasites are destroying the @entity197 , and how the @entity198 , " charts this demise and argues that it can be blamed , in part , on the online economy 's misguided focus on free content and the self - interested permissiveness of powerful digital companies toward online piracy			1
in many ways , @entity195 's argument is also about the relationship between technology and employment			0
rather than the android , however , @entity195 's enemy is the online pirate whose theft of intellectual property has resulted , he says , in many thousands of creative professionals losing their jobs			0
@entity195 's argument puts him in the camp of innovation skeptics			1
like @entity95 and @entity101 , this former @entity223 editor is not against technology and recognizes that , for better or worse , the digital revolution is an unavoidable reality of our age			0
but " @entity193 " is a carefully calibrated reminder that there is nothing either inevitable or beneficial about the crumbling of many traditional media companies and that we , as regular consumers of music , books and movies , are the ultimate losers when these industries decline			1
artificial intelligence : good or bad ? i 've already mentioned two of my top five 2011 books : @entity195 's " @entity193 " and @entity101 and @entity99 's " @entity125			0
" the next two pretty much pick themselves			0
@entity246 's blockbuster " @entity247 " is a rich and balanced biography of the ultimate innovation fundamentalist , ultra-willing to sacrifice everything and everyone at the altar of technological creativity			0
while @entity260 's acclaimed " @entity258 , a theory , a @entity259 , " is a brilliant analysis of why and how information has become the motor of the early 21st century 's innovation economy			0
my final choice is @entity263 's " @entity262 : how @entity68 ate all the @entity264 , got @entity266 , and @entity267 , " which addresses the relationship between technological innovation and prosperity			2
@entity263 , an economist at @entity272 university , blows up every orthodoxy			0
he argues there has n't been much technological innovation over the last 50 years which , he notes , explains the scarcity of ordinary jobs in today 's economy			1
ironically , @entity263 pins his hopes for future prosperity on the commercial success of artificial intelligence technology -- a development which , of course , @entity101 and @entity99 blame for today 's unemployment crisis			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity290			2

@entity290 argues relationship between digital tech and jobs will become focus in 2012
debate will pitch so - called " innovation fundamentalists " against " innovation skeptics , " @entity290 says
regular consumers are the true losers of the collapse of old media businesses , he adds
