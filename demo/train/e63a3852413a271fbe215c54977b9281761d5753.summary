-- at the risk of propagating a dodgy cliché , @entity1 remains one of the last frontiers of travel			1
non-air - conditioned travel , that is , i.e. the kind where you risk stubbing your toe occasionally or getting genuinely lost			2
from gorilla sighting in the @entity15 highlands to skiing -- yes , skiing -- in @entity18 , it promises untold travel wonders			1
but new @entity1 hands should worry less about stocking up on viral jabs and safari suits than ditching their preconceptions			1
for a start ... @entity1 can be very cold indeed it might straddle the equator but not everywhere in @entity1 is scorching			1
@entity28 ( @entity29 ) and @entity30 both have glaciers and nights can be dangerously chilly in the desert , with temperatures dropping to as low as -10c			1
it snows in places , too			2
you can go skiing in the @entity40 in @entity18 , the @entity41 , @entity42 and in the @entity43 , @entity1			1
alongside desert , there are mountains and rainforests @entity1 does have vast swathes of desert and flat savanna but also mountainous and exceptionally green parts			1
there are the sprawling rainforests of @entity15 , @entity54 and the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) and the soft green hill country of @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity29			2
for more cultivated greenness , @entity1 's garden route , on the south - east coast , is so - named because of its lush vegetation and lakes			1
and not every desert is a stretch of barren wilderness			0
the @entity67 is known for its spring flowers , while the @entity69 , the oldest desert in the world , is home to desert - adapted elephant , rhino , giraffe and lion			0
more on @entity0 : touring @entity75 's @entity1 hippos are the big killers you should worry less about lions and @entity81 crocodiles and instead keep an eye out for hippos			1
they 're the biggest people - killers on the continent			0
found in @entity87 , the animal is aggressive , unpredictable and can charge at 28kph			0
if you 're in a boat ( where many people will encounter them ) hit the sides to signal your position			0
if on foot , keep your distance and never get between a mother and her calf			0
hippos are most aggressive in the dry season when water levels are low and food supplies limited			0
listen out for oxpeckers since the birds issue warning calls if hippo are around			0
you wo n't need every shot in the book your childhood vaccines should be up to date for an @entity1 trip but you do n't need prevention against every disease going			1
a rabies shot is advisable -- but plan it in advance as it 's a series of jabs -- along with injections against hepatitis a , meningococcal meningitis and typhoid			1
you may need yellow fever vaccination , too			0
for some countries , such as @entity1 , it 's an entry requirement			1
consult with your doctor about your specific travel plans and medical history			0
find out more about virus protection while traveling at the @entity128 website			2
@entity129 is useful -- african @entity129 even better @entity1 's countless ethnic groups mean there are several hundred languages , many with distinct dialects , you could come across			1
former colonial languages -- @entity135 , @entity129 and @entity136 -- are common , but @entity135 may not be as widely spoken as you think			2
@entity129 is almost essential in @entity137 or @entity138 and will probably come in useful in @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity54 and @entity142			0
african @entity129 , however , is very different from what you were probably taught at school -- while you should be able to make yourself understood , you might find it harder understanding others			2
the informal " tu " is used much more frequently in @entity1 than it would be in @entity146 , but if you 're dealing with officials it 's perhaps safer to stick with " vous			1
" more on @entity0 : 10 of the best golf courses in @entity1 you do n't need countless visas ... if you 're traveling in @entity152 , consider getting a @entity153 ( @entity154 ) which covers @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 all in the one document			1
it costs around $ 50 , is valid for up to two consecutive months and should save you time and money			0
embassies of @entity155 seem to issue these with the least amount of hassle , although theoretically they 're available from any of the countries ' embassies			0
... but your car will need papers if you plan to drive a hire car through @entity1 you may well need a carnet de passage or a triptyque ( the former is for entry to multiple countries , the latter to one ) , although neither is required for @entity177 , @entity139 and @entity142			1
carnets are issued by national motoring organizations and act as a guarantee that import duties will be paid if a vehicle is taken into a country and remains there			0
hire companies wo n't issue you with a carnet unless they have proof you can afford any duties , so you 'll need insurance to cover this			2
some southern @entity191 countries do n't demand a carnet , although they 'll insist you buy a @entity193 at the border			2
find out more about vehicle documentation at the @entity197 website ( page in @entity135 )			0
@entity199 is a travel writer and former @entity201 broadcaster who specializes in conservation issues and adventure travel .			0

what should every new @entity1 traveler ditch first ? their preconceptions
it 's not scorching everywhere -- there are glaciers
crocs and lions are n't the most *lethal* animals
and you need n't have every virus shot in the book
