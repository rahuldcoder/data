-- the scandal over allegations that @entity4 agents brought prostitutes to their hotel rooms in @entity7 ahead of a visit by @entity10 president @entity9 keeps growing			1
and with it come awkward questions about whether a strong macho element in the culture of the @entity4 could pose a threat to security , and how women agents fit into the picture			1
journalist and commentator @entity19 asked in a blog post tuesday why there are not more female @entity4 agents to counter this kind of bad behavior			1
" the reason there should be more is simple : women do n't get into trouble the way men do , " she wrote			2
" seriously , can you imagine a bunch of @entity4 gals going on a trip to @entity7 , where they are scheduled to secure the environment for their boss , who happens to be , oh , the most powerful man in the world , and then hiring a bunch of call guys ? " she asks			1
the identities of the 11 @entity4 agents implicated in the investigation have not been disclosed , nor have those of as many as 10 @entity10 military personnel also suspected of involvement			1
but it is widely assumed they are all men			0
three agents involved in scandal leave @entity4 however , @entity55 , who wrote " @entity56 to history : an agent 's life inside the @entity4 , " with former senior special agent @entity66 , said the incident in @entity7 should not cast doubts on the professionalism of @entity4 agents as a whole , whatever their gender			1
" they are to a man -- and woman -- so extremely proud , and share that pride and @entity71 , like the @entity72			0
and when a bunch of idiots pull a stunt like this , these men and women are insulted and infuriated by it , " he said			0
" but at no point was the president under threat and it never could have led to that			0
" @entity55 puts the @entity7 incident down to " alcohol , mixed with testosterone and a dash of hubris , and that 's a nasty combination , " but points out that bad behavior by groups of men away from home is not a rarity			1
" but they are idiots , they know what they are supposed to do and how they are supposed to behave , " he added of the agents allegedly involved , some of whom are reportedly married			0
how many female @entity4 agents were among several hundred @entity10 personnel sent to @entity7 to safeguard @entity9 during a summit in @entity102 is not known			1
but @entity55 says women -- who made up about a quarter of the @entity4 's 6,913 employees in 2010 , according to an @entity106 report -- are an integral part of the @entity4			1
this is because women have to be able to do everything the male agents do , including expert firearms use , and are deployed in just the same way to protect the president , he said			1
" they really can shoot that weapon -- and when @entity4 fire , they do n't miss , " he said			2
women are also better suited than their male counterparts to do some things , @entity55 said , such as accompanying the first lady if she makes a restroom stop			1
they also fit right into the presidential protective division , or @entity125 -- the innermost ring of steel around the president			0
former @entity4 agent @entity66 had women on his detail when he was in charge of the @entity125 for president @entity132 , @entity55 said			1
" they had to ride the big thoroughbred horses the same as the men , " @entity55 said			0
" or when they went skiing with @entity139 , they had to be able to ski and keep up with him while still wearing the gun and the radio			0
physically , it 's tough			0
" the @entity4 has not yet responded to a @entity0 request for information on how its women agents are deployed			1
but its annual report for fiscal year 2010 outlines the efforts made to find suitable female recruits			0
those who have taken part in college sports are of particular interest , the report says , as " the goal is to target college / university women athletes who are capable of completing the @entity4 's rigorous physical fitness training program			1
" women have been part of the @entity4 for four decades			2
the first female @entity4 agent to die in the line of duty was special agent @entity163 , in 1980			2
@entity164 , a veteran agent of the @entity4 , marked a happier milestone when she became the first woman in the agency 's history to be named deputy director , in 2004			1
@entity170 , a former @entity171 reporter and author of " in the president 's @entity4 : @entity178 and the presidents they protect , " says an under - representation of women is not a factor in how the @entity7 scandal unfolded			1
" they are involved in everything			0
there 's not a problem with women at all			2
i just do n't think there 's any issue here at all , " he said			0
and suggestions that a pervasive macho culture within the service may have fueled the agents ' misconduct are also off the mark , he said			2
" when women first started there was this issue , but that 's a long time ago			2
obviously this episode raises questions like that , but it 's really not representative			0
the problem is that the management is lax in many ways			0
there 's lots of corner - cutting going on			0
" @entity170 told @entity0 in another interview that the image generated by the scandal of agents partying hard while on work trips also is misleading			2
" they are so overworked most of the time that they are forced to go into overtime , that they barely have time for a life , let alone to party , " he said			0
with internal investigations ongoing and a likely @entity223 hearing next week , there will be little in the way of good times coming soon for those caught up in the furor			0
and the spotlight shone on the @entity4 may mean it 's in line for a wider shake - up			1
rep. @entity232 , @entity233 , a senior member of the @entity234 , is one of those who think change is overdue -- and that @entity4 director @entity237 will have to go			2
" i think it 's time to put somebody else in there to make sure we 're getting a different culture in the @entity4 , " @entity232 told @entity0			1
@entity0 's @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 contributed to this report .			0
