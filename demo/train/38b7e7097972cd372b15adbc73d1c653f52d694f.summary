by the time he reached his third hospital , where he could not afford his medical bills , the cytomegalovirus had crawled to his brain , @entity52 said			1
" it was very , very sad situation for him			0
" football in the @entity76 country has been torn apart by infighting between the @entity78 ( @entity79 ) and the breakaway @entity82 ( @entity81 )			2
@entity84 's ruling body , @entity83 , has threatened to impose sanctions unless an agreement is reached			2
both bodies , which have their own competitions , have agreed to run just one league next season to avoid punishment from @entity83 , whose executive committee expects to have to rule on the matter at its meeting next friday			0
the @entity79 did not immediately respond to @entity97 's request for comment			0
" unfortunately yet again , it seems that the set objectives will not be reached and we , therefore , anticipate that the @entity79 will be sanctioned , " @entity83 secretary - general @entity99 wrote in a letter to @entity18 sports minister @entity101			2
" we are fully aware that @entity18 is passionate about football and that sanctions will have a major impact			1

" however , the financial problems do not only hit the breakaway clubs but also the clubs which play under the @entity79 competition			0
" he said 13 clubs from both leagues are months late with payments , according to the players ' association			0
" on this matter , @entity79 said on its official website that they would help the cost of flying @entity0 's body back to @entity12 , but they wo n't pay the players ' salary as @entity19 did not play under @entity79 competition , " @entity52 said			1
" on the other hand , @entity19 officials said they have transferred @entity0 's salary to his wife in @entity12			1
" @entity52 said an out - of - contract @entity160 footballer , @entity162 , also died in similar circumstances three months ago after being infected during treatment in an @entity18 hospital			1
while solo mayor @entity168 has said he will pay @entity0 's hospital bills , the act of charity has come too late for @entity170 , which represents footballers around the world , with a membership of 60,000			1

" i know countless stories of players who are intentionally not paid by their club and have to wait for months for their salary			0
but i have never before heard a story where a seriously ill player has been left completely to his fate by a club			0
" i assume that both the club and the national football association of @entity18 realize that they have seriously failed and that they have much to explain , particularly to the family and relatives of @entity0			1
the least the club can do is to pay the arrears in salary to his family			0
" @entity0 's body has been transported back to @entity12 , where he will be buried			1
