-- do a quick search on @entity2 , and you 're sure to find job talk			1
a friend who got laid off			0
a family member turned down for a promotion			0
or an old high - school pal celebrating their dream job			0
on @entity2 , employment status is just one more thing people feel free to share openly , not just with those they 're closest to			1
while sharing a job loss or termination may make some cringe , @entity2 data scientists say there might actually be some advantages to it			2
highlights of a @entity2 study , " @entity2 use by job - seekers , " were posted on the site 's data science blog on thursday			1
the study tracked several thousand people over three months with monthly check - ins			1
of the 3,000 surveyed , 169 were unemployed at some point during the study			1
authors @entity31 and @entity33 intended to measure stress levels and support from close friends and family on @entity2 during major life events			1
@entity38 is a data scientist at @entity2 and @entity33 is with the @entity40 at @entity41			2
to determine how connected people were , @entity2 was given permission to track participants ' time spent on the social network and some of their actions , but not the content of their actions			1
for example , they tracked whether participants left comments on their friend 's photos , but not what was said			0
in short , everyone who engaged directly , and a slightly more than average amount , with close family and friends experienced more support and were more motivated			1
they were also less stressed and were generally able to expand their networks			0
the study also found that people who regularly engaged on @entity2 found jobs much faster than those who did n't , although researchers said they did not have enough information to know where they found out about these jobs or if anyone in their networks played a direct role			1
but the study also found that for a small subset of job seekers , stress levels increased when close friends or family members would repeatedly ask , " so how 's the job search going ? " stress also increased when participants received unwanted advice or pushed the job seeker to " try harder			1
" " i feel worse about my job when using @entity2 , " one participant wrote			2
" i find it really hard to connect with people who care about me / my life			1
i get a lot of pity comments on @entity2			2
" although social networks can be ideal places for support during a crisis , participants found there are limits to online compassion			0
one study participant said she felt worse during her unemployment , especially when reading @entity104 updates about celebrations			0
" no one really shares sad or depressing stuff , " the study quotes the participant as saying			0
" they must have some concerns but most of my contacts act as if they do not			0
so in comparison , i feel worse			0
" there 's a lot of debate about whether the @entity119 is " good " or " bad " for us ; this study shows that the effects really depend on whom you 're talking to and what 's happening in your life , " said @entity38 in an email			0
" in this way , the online world is much like the offline			0
for the job - seekers out there , recognize that this is a stressful period , but you 're not alone and your close friends may be able to help			2
