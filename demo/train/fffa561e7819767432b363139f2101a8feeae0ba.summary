@entity1 , @entity0 to leave , " said one 19 - year - old man hours after the intense day of protests			1
@entity0 president @entity8 is not gone , but his days are numbered			1
the leader agreed tuesday to not seek re-election in september			0
he told @entity11 thursday he would like to step down right away , but can not because he does not want to risk plunging his nation into chaos			1
in the bloody blur of days since his announcement that he would not stand for re-election , regime foes and opponents have clashed repeatedly in @entity1 's @entity19 , the center of anti-government demonstrations			2
eight people have been killed and nearly 850 injured , according to the health ministry			0
although his government has made concessions , @entity8 faces another challenge friday , which opponents have dubbed " @entity27 " and " @entity28 " -- references to further large protests they hope will prompt the president to step down now			1
thursday saw an escalation of attacks on journalists , many of whom asked whether the government was clearing them out of the way so as to cloak its actions			2
journalists said it was too dangerous to be at @entity19 or to provide live camera feeds			0
vice president @entity43 laid some of the unrest 's blame on the media			1
" i actually blame certain friendly nations who have television channels , they are not friendly at all , who have intensified the youth against the nation and the state , " @entity43 told @entity48			0
" they have filled in the minds of the youth with wrongdoings , with allegations , and this is unacceptable			0
" state - run @entity48 said a segment of anti-government protesters , called the 25th of january youth , will leave the square and form a political party to compete in upcoming elections			0
meanwhile , @entity2 's @entity68 said on " @entity69 " thursday night that , if anything , the @entity8 foes increased the portion of @entity19 they occupy in the standoff			1
it 's not clear if organizers of the protests planned after friday prayers would be able to rally the numbers they had last week or reach the presidential palace , @entity68 said			2
tension was building before dawn friday , he said			0
@entity8 told @entity11 correspondent @entity82 that he was troubled by the bloody clashes that broke out wednesday in @entity19			1
as the @entity84 and other countries condemned increasing attacks on journalists and diplomats , @entity8 rejected the notion that government instigated the violence in the country , instead blaming the @entity93 , an @entity94 umbrella group that is banned in @entity0			1
" i do n't care what people say about me , " @entity8 told @entity11			1
" right now i care about my country , i care about @entity0			2
" i was very unhappy about yesterday			0
i do not want to see @entity0 fighting each other , " he said in the interview , which was conducted at the heavily guarded presidential palace where the embattled leader has been staying with his family			1
@entity8 told @entity11 that @entity84 president @entity103 is a very good man but bristled at the notion of an ally 's interference in internal problems			1
he said he told @entity103 : " you do n't understand the @entity0 culture and what would happen if i step down now			2
" @entity103 has said he told @entity113 a transition must take place , and it " must be meaningful , it must be peaceful and it must begin now			0
" @entity8 said he never intended to seek re-election			2
nor did he intend his son , @entity117 , who was believed to be groomed as @entity8 's successor , to seek the post			1
he made the comment to @entity82 in his son 's presence			0
the @entity103 administration had no comment on the interview			0
a @entity127 aide told @entity2 the only thing that caught the administration 's attention from the interview was @entity8 's comments on his son			1
@entity43 , tapped as @entity8 's vice president last saturday , publicly announced thursday that @entity113 will not stand in september elections			1
@entity8 , who has ruled @entity0 for three decades , announced this week that he would not run for re-election			1
but that concession has not been enough for tens of thousands of protesters demanding immediate change			0
sen. @entity139 , @entity140 , told @entity2 's @entity141 that negotiations on new leadership and elections are crucial			1
" the longer that this transition is delayed the likelihood of further escalation and violence is increased , " he said			1
although @entity150 , @entity0 's second - largest city , was largely calm thursday , there are concerns about possible clashes when anti-mubarak demonstrators mark a " @entity27 , " a reference to the president , according to @entity2 's @entity156			1
@entity8 's regime moved thursday to quell the deadly revolt , telling protesters their demands had been met and cracking down on journalists and human rights activists bearing witness to the crisis			1
all day long , @entity8 's supporters and foes clashed to retain control of @entity19 , the central city plaza that has become the symbol of the 10 - day @entity0 uprising			1
many looked like medieval warriors , toting handcrafted shields while throwing stones and other objects			0
top government leaders vowed to hold accountable perpetrators of the bloodshed and told protesters to return home			0
" i want to thank the youth for all you have done , " @entity43 said on state - run @entity48			0
" you are the lights that have ignited reform in this period			0
please give the ( government a ) chance to play its role			0
all of your demands have been met			0
" @entity43 told @entity11 that @entity0 troops will not force @entity191 protesters to leave @entity19			1
@entity8 supporters , some believed to be paid government thugs , converged with anti-government crowds wednesday in a confrontation that quickly evolved into continuing mayhem in @entity19			1
at least eight people were killed and 836 injured , including 200 wounded within one hour thursday morning , according to the health ministry			0
journalists covering the crisis also became targets -- beaten , bloodied , harassed and detained by men , most all in some way aligned with @entity8			2
numerous news outlets -- including the @entity206 , @entity11 , @entity207 , the @entity208 and @entity2 -- reported members of their staffs had either been attacked or arrested			2
@entity211 and @entity212 also reported that staffers were detained			0
in several cases , news personnel were accused of being " foreign spies , " seized , whisked away , and often assaulted			0
@entity217 , a correspondent for the @entity218 , told @entity2 he was dragged from a car at a checkpoint thursday and accused of spying for @entity221			0
" this is a dark day for @entity0 and a dark day for journalism , " said @entity222 of the @entity223			2
" the systematic and sustained attacks ... leave no doubt that a government - orchestrated effort to target the media and suppress the news is well under way			2
" @entity233 columnist @entity232 said he fears an even broader crackdown			0
" why does n't the government want us around ? what is it that it plans to do in the next few days that it really does n't want cameras to be able to report on ? " @entity232 asked on @entity2 's " @entity241			2
" the @entity242 publicly condemned the crackdown on journalists , and officials told @entity2 they have received reports that @entity0 's @entity247 was involved			1
secretary of state @entity248 called such attacks " a violation of international norms that guarantee freedom of the press , and it is unacceptable in any circumstances			0
" vice president @entity255 told @entity43 that @entity0 's government is responsible for ensuring that peaceful demonstrators are n't attacked			1
increasingly concerned about the potential for further violence , @entity258 called on the government , political parties and others to immediately begin talks " on a peaceful and orderly transition			1
" the leaders of @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 also urged a " rapid and peaceful transition , " and the @entity274 foreign affairs chief , @entity273 , called on @entity8 to act " as quickly as possible			1
" @entity0 prime minister @entity275 apologized repeatedly for the violence			1
he blamed infiltrators and a " complete disappearance " of police for the human toll in the " catastrophe			0
" " this group got in and some clashes happened , " @entity275 said , adding that he would look into whether the violence was part of an organized attempt to disband the opposition			0
@entity275 said he and @entity43 were meeting with the opposition -- including protesters in @entity19			0
he said no one would be excluded from the national dialogue , including the @entity93			2
the @entity84 is stepping up pressure on the opposition to begin immediate negotiations with the @entity0 government , recognizing the orderly transition to democracy @entity103 called for could prove difficult if @entity8 stepped down immediately			1
" we ca n't dictate what an orderly transition means , but it 's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves , " a senior @entity242 official told @entity2			2
" the government has to take some steps , but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well			2
" @entity2 's @entity315 , @entity156 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 , @entity313 and journalist @entity314 contributed to this report .			0
