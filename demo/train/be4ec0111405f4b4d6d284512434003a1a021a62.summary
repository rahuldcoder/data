-- @entity1 vividly remembers her first introduction to thermodynamics			0
it was her freshman year at the @entity5 , and she sat in a large auditorium filled with students aspiring to degrees in chemical engineering			1
" the first thing the ( professor ) told us was , ' you should expect to see this class dwindle down as the semester goes on			0
' it was the first thing they told us , " she said			0
@entity20 said the professor 's expectation came true			0
as the semester progressed , students began to drop the class , some switching to other majors entirely			1
@entity20 hung on , although it took her five years and three summer sessions to complete her bachelor 's degree in chemical engineering			1
" i was a very persistent and resilient person , " @entity20 said			0
" i remember bombing my first calculus exam , and i could have dropped			0
if it was n't for my ( persistence ) , i could have seen that score and said , ' well , maybe this is n't for me			0
' " undergraduates across the country are choosing to leave science , technology , engineering and math programs before they graduate with those degrees			1
many students in those @entity47 fields struggle to complete their degrees in four years , or drop out , according to a 2010 @entity50 , @entity51 , study			1
the study , conducted by @entity54 's @entity53 , found students in science , math and engineering take longer to complete their degrees than students who start out majoring in other fields			1
the study tracked thousands of students who entered college for the first time in 2004			1
thirty - six percent of white , 21 % of black and 22 % of @entity67 undergraduate students in @entity47 fields finished their bachelor 's degrees in @entity47 fields within five years of initial enrollment			1
nearly 22 % dropped out after five years			1
low graduation rates among science and math undergraduates affect how the @entity75 competes globally			1
fewer biology and math majors means fewer doctors and engineers later			2
how to stop @entity75 's math , science lag in president @entity83 's @entity85 speech this year , he said science , technology , engineering and math will guide the country 's future , and education improvements are needed			1
" maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to @entity75 's success ... if we want innovation to produce jobs in @entity75 and not overseas , then we also have to win the race to educate our kids , " @entity83 said			1
@entity102 , executive director of the @entity103 , said a big problem is that educators do n't often realize the urgency of fostering the next generation of @entity75 scientists and engineers			1
" people who follow this issue understand the connection between a @entity47 workforce and national competitiveness			0
but that 's not enough , " @entity102 said			0
" universities and faculty have to understand this is a national priority			0
" ' @entity119 ' @entity120 , director of the @entity53 and one of the @entity54 study 's authors , said high school seniors are interested in pursuing science , math and engineering degrees more than ever			1
but research shows that most do n't make it to the finish line			0
" many students want to be in science , but very talented people are choosing other fields			1
that should n't be the case , " @entity120 said			0
" it 's important to understand how we close this gap			0
" poor scientific literacy among college students is one reason students pursuing science and math are less likely to graduate from those programs			1
high school graduates are n't prepared for first - year science classes in college , @entity120 said			1
but there 's another problem , too : higher education , itself			1
science and math programs are designed and taught to winnow down the number of students			1
university tenure systems often reward professors who conduct research and publish their work , but not those who teach well			0
among students who majored in liberal arts , business or other fields , 73 % of white students and about 63 % of black and @entity67 students finished their degrees in five years			1
forty - one percent of @entity75 students who start off majoring in science , math , engineering or technology fields graduate from those programs within six years			1
more collaborative and supportive environments for @entity47 students are one of the solutions to the problem , @entity120 said			2
one girl 's academic success defies all expectations -- even her dad 's @entity20 , the @entity5 student , said her classes were all " sink or swim			0
" " there were not a lot of resources to develop interest in students , " @entity20 said			2
( professors ) say , ' here 's the workload , if you can handle it , you 're good to go			0
' " when @entity198 majored in biology at @entity200 , working one - on - one with a science professor was key to maintaining her interest in the field , she said			2
she managed to finish her bachelor 's degree in four years			2
" i had a really good experience majoring in biology because my junior year , i did an independent study with a professor , " @entity198 said			0
" it was great to have the freedom to do that			0
" @entity211 , president of the @entity212 , said @entity75 attitudes toward science are hurting @entity47 graduation rates			1
" we in @entity75 have accepted that science is just not for everybody			1
we send messages to students all the time that , ' this is not really for you , ' " he said			2
" one of the reasons @entity75 ( students ) are n't more excited about science is that adults themselves are n't excited			1
most ( students ) have been weeded out before they even get to college			2
" @entity211 said many people assume they 're not smart enough to study science or math. his response ? " no. your teacher was n't innovative enough			2
" changing the culture schools admit more science majors than they expect to graduate , and do n't teach students to support each other , @entity211 said , instead fostering an atmosphere of cutthroat competition			1
" we say , ' if we accept you in science , you have ability to do it , and we 'll help you succeed , ' " @entity211 said			2
" what has made the difference at @entity212 is the way we encourage group work and teachers to rethink their approach in the classroom			0
the results are significantly more students are succeeding			2
" the @entity212 puts an emphasis on research , @entity211 said			0
the university has space for biotechnology companies that can work with students on campus			2
the school 's curriculum emphasizes student collaboration and research projects that require students to solve real - world problems			2
@entity120 , the @entity54 researcher , said the school has earned a reputation for solid completion rates in science and math fields , especially among black students			1
in 2010 , @entity278 and @entity279 ranked it first among " up - and - coming schools , " and gave it a high rank for undergraduate teaching and undergrad engineering programs			0
opinion : why liberal arts matter " we need more supportive programs and less sorting , " @entity120 said			0
" the most important practice in terms of sustaining interest among students is faculty involvement in research programs that connect students and give them a feel for what it 's like to be a scientist			2
" @entity20 said research was an elective class during her undergraduate years , and nobody encouraged her to pursue it			0
with little mentorship made available , it was easy to become discouraged			0
" my parents did n't go to college and i did n't have a support system , " @entity20 said			0
" there were no ( students ) ahead of me in the program who could give me encouragement			0
it 's very difficult to do it alone , without a support system			0
" after taking five years to graduate with her bachelor 's degree , @entity20 went on to get a master 's degree in science and engineering and now works as a chemical engineer for @entity328 , as part of the team developing advancements in the sports drink , @entity333			1
" i chose to keep going , " she said .			0

science and math students struggle to complete their degrees in four years , if at all
researchers say higher education must " weed out " students
more and better prepared science and tech students keep the @entity75 competitive .
