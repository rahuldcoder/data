-- there is a general consensus that women 's tennis needs a new name to ignite some excitement into it and , at this week 's @entity9 , it does appear likely that the @entity11 sisters will once again be the ones to beat at the grass - court grand slam			1
the @entity11 sisters have dominated @entity9 this century and contested last year 's final			1
defending champion @entity16 ( five wins ) and younger sibling @entity11 ( two wins ) have dominated the tournament since 2000 , with only @entity20 ( 2004 ) and @entity21 ( 2006 ) breaking that monopoly			2
in fact , the @entity11 domination has been so great this century that the 2006 final -- when @entity21 beat @entity26 -- is the only final when one of the @entity29 duo has not been involved			1
both @entity20 and @entity21 are back this year , although their participation had seemed in doubt in the early part of 2009			0
@entity20 certainly has the powerful game to claim another @entity9 title , but a persistent shoulder injury has plagued her all year and she comes into the competition poorly prepared			0
at nearly 30 , @entity21 is now a veteran of the @entity38			0
she had looked a spent force last year , but has enjoyed some better results this year and comes into the tournament as the 17th seed			0
a potential third round showdown with top seed @entity44 will test her to the limit , although she would undoubtedly have the fans ' support should that encounter materialize			1
@entity44 's standing as world number one has divided opinion			2
the @entity52 is yet to win a grand slam and wasted another opportunity to end that particular hoodoo when losing to compatriot @entity56 in the @entity57 final last month			1
the 23 - year - old comes into the tournament with a niggling knee injury and has not impressed in her pre-tournament displays			0
the feeling remains that should the @entity11 sisters decided to play more @entity38 events then one of them , and not @entity44 , would be topping the world rankings			1
@entity52 @entity67 and @entity56 are seeded fourth and fifth and both have chances should they bring their top game to @entity71 , although again it is hard to see one of them defeating an in - form @entity11 sister			2
former world number one @entity75 has slipped down the world rankings this year and she too has yet to win a major , while 13th - seed @entity77 has not shown anything like the form that saw her win last year 's @entity57			2
last year 's semifinalist @entity81 of @entity82 loves the surface and could figure again			0
unfortunately for her , she is due to face @entity11 in the fourth round .			0

the @entity11 sisters are expected to dominate women 's singles once again
the @entity29 have won seven out of the last nine @entity9 tournaments
top seed @entity44 heads the rankings despite not winning a grand slam
