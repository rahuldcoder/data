women face shocking disparities when buying health insurance on the individual market : in the vast majority of states , nearly all the best - selling plans charge women more than men for the same coverage , a discriminatory practice known as " gender rating			1
" new research by the @entity13 released monday shows that , in states that have not banned gender rating , 92 % of the top plans charge women more -- despite the fact that the vast majority of them do not cover maternity services			1
this indefensible practice will not abate until the @entity23 is fully implemented in 2014			1
the practice of gender rating costs women about $ 1 billion a year , based on average advertised premiums and the most recent data on the number of women in the individual market			1
for a woman in @entity34 struggling to get by on a low - wage job , pay for child care , and make the rent , being forced to pay an extra $ 646 a year in premiums because she is a woman can be an insurmountable hurdle			0
in @entity42 , women pay as much as $ 1,141 extra per year in premiums			2
even smaller disparities in premiums can take a toll on women year after year			0
on top of that , women may be required to pay extra for inadequate maternity coverage , or pay the full cost of maternity care itself , which averages $ 9,600 for an uncomplicated delivery			1
the discrimination is so pronounced and the practice so arbitrary that in most states , women who do not smoke are often charged more than men who do smoke			1
for example , the center found that 56 % of best - selling plans charge a 40 - year - old woman who does not smoke more than a 40 - year - old man who does			1
only nine states require insurers on the individual market to provide maternity coverage			0
in states where maternity coverage is not mandated , a shocking 94 % of health plans available to a 30 - year - old woman do not provide such coverage			1
and in 25 states , not a single insurance plan on the individual market covers maternity services			0
to add insult to injury , women who have been survivors of domestic violence or who have had @entity84 sections -- so - called " pre-existing conditions " -- can be denied coverage			2
@entity91 of @entity92 , with whom i testified at a @entity94 hearing in 2009 , told senators that because of her previous c - section , an insurer told her she could only obtain coverage if she were sterilized			0
my organization has been researching the disparities that women face in this insurance market for years			0
in 2008 , 93 % of best - selling individual plans charged women higher premiums			2
today , it 's 92 %			1
clearly , it 's not changing , and insurance companies will continue to dig in their heels and discriminate until the law forces them to change			0
only 14 states have limited or banned gender rating on the individual market , including , most recently , @entity114 , @entity92 , and @entity115			1
but this problem is clearly not going away by itself			0
this national problem demands a national solution and , fortunately , we have one in the @entity23			1
that 's one reason why the @entity13 has launched a campaign to educate women about the benefits of the health care law , including the end of insurance discrimination			2
the center 's new campaign , @entity129 , tells women about the benefits of the @entity23 and engages them to fight to protect the law			2
on monday , the center released a video of intimate portraits of women on the campaign 's website			0
more than 30 organizations have joined the campaign , from women 's organizations to health care advocacy groups to those representing physicians and other health care providers			0
the @entity23 is so important to women 's health			1
it bans pre-existing condition exclusions , prohibits gender rating and other forms of sex discrimination in health care , guarantees maternity coverage for all , and ensures that new plans cover recommended preventive care -- such as birth control , without co-payments or deductibles			1
as we 've seen recently in the debate over access to birth control , the promise of expanded access to affordable health care for women only comes with the force of law behind it			0
the @entity172 designated advances in contraception as one of the 10 most important developments in health care of the 20th century , reducing both maternal and infant mortality			0
under the @entity23 , millions more women are already getting preventive services like mammograms , pap smears and colonoscopies without a co-pay , and later this year , millions more will have access to well - woman exams , screening for domestic violence -- and birth control without a co-pay or deductible			1
the @entity23 is under attack in @entity192 and is being challenged in the @entity193 , which will hear oral arguments on monday in the health care litigation			2
the obstacles women face in gaining access to insurance and health care take an acute economic toll on them , as our report shows , and on the @entity205 economy as a whole			2
women have a tremendous stake in the outcome of these cases			0
women are more likely than men to forgo preventive care if it 's too expensive , to be under - insured and to report problems paying medical bills			0
for these reasons , the center submitted an amicus brief on behalf of 60 organizations to the @entity193 , as we did in four previous @entity222 cases , setting out what 's at stake for women in the @entity23 and the health care litigation			1
the @entity23 is one of the most significant advances for women in our nation 's history			0
this is no time to enable discrimination to continue and even turn back the clock on women 's health .			0

@entity237 : 92 % of the top health insurance plans charge women more than men
