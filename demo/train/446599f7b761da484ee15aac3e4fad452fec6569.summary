-- an octogenarian climber has abandoned his bid to reclaim the title of the oldest man to climb @entity5 after a combination of poor climbing weather and government red tape forced him to call off the ascent			1
veteran @entity12 climber @entity11 , 81 , had been acclimatizing at base camp , ready to reclaim his title from longtime rival 80 - year - old @entity15 who became the oldest climber to reach the summit of the world 's highest mountain last week			1
however , a government promise to provide one million @entity12 rupees ( us $ 11,200 ) for the bid -- on which other sponsorship money hinged -- was awaiting government @entity25 approval in @entity26			1
team leader @entity27 told @entity0 that going up @entity5 was now too risky because the snow had started to melt , making ladders and other equipment unstable			2
he said that since other expeditions had already left the mountain , there would be no manpower available in the event of a rescue			0
the government had also pledged to help @entity11 's bid by waiving the @entity5 climbing permit fee of us $ 10,000 but this was also held up by @entity25 delays			1
@entity42 , the @entity43 of the @entity44 and @entity45 , said his department , which processes climbing permits , had received the application late and the waiver could only be decided by ministers			0
" the government makes decisions following its own procedure , " he said			0
@entity11 downplayed rumors he was returning due to health concerns			0
" when one goes to climb such a mountain there are small health issues , " he told @entity0			0
oldest @entity5 climber finally gets recognition @entity11 and @entity15 have been rivals for at least five years			1
the two mountaineers first clashed in 2008 , when @entity11 , then 76 , reached the 29,028 - foot ( 8,848 - meter ) peak a day before @entity15 , then 75			1
however , it was @entity15 's ascent that made it into @entity67 , forcing @entity11 to travel to @entity68 to set the record straight			1
back in @entity12 , he gathered paperwork , photos , witness accounts and media reports to confirm his ascent , and his feat finally entered the record books in 2010			1
@entity11 earlier dismissed talk that he was making the climb because he was in danger of losing his record			2
he said he had planned to reach the summit last year but failed to secure financial support			0
" why should i go to set a record ? i have my own record			0
i wanted to climb @entity5 in my eighth decade , " he said before he left for base camp			1
this year marks the 60th anniversary of the first expedition to reach the summit of @entity5 : sir @entity89 and @entity90 made it to the top of the mountain on may 29 , 1953			2
before he boarded his flight at @entity95 on sunday , @entity15 said he had scaled @entity5 for the last time			1
the deadly traffic jam on top of the world " i think three times is enough , " said @entity15 , who made his first ascent at the age of 70			2
" at this point i could not think of anything but rest			0
" he wished @entity11 good luck but called on his rival to take a photograph as evidence of a successful climb			1
known for his exploits as an extreme skier , @entity15 made the ascent with his son @entity113			2
@entity11 's wife , however , was less than thrilled by her husband 's late - in - life mountaineering			2
" of course i do not want him to go , " @entity118 said			0
" i had told him not to go even the first time			0
" @entity11 was being assisted in his ascent by a sherpa who has climbed @entity5 12 times			1
to prepare , @entity11 carried a 25 - kilogram ( 55 - pound ) load on his back while walking up and down the stairs of his three - story @entity26 home several times a day			0
" if i am unsuccessful , it will be because of the weather			0
it will not be because of my physical condition , " @entity11 said , before he set off .			0
