-- traversing the infamous @entity1 was an experience unlike any other i 've been through			1
during a grueling 14 - day expedition through the ice - strewn @entity7 , our seven - man team faced challenges that not even the intense training we went through beforehand could prepare us for			1
it is one thing being told what the @entity7 is like : seeing it and living it firsthand is quite another			0
the only one among us with adventure experience was @entity17 , our unflappable expedition leader , but by the time we finished we all felt like hardened veterans			2
from our start point in @entity21 , to the pride and relief of reaching @entity24 a fortnight later , the journey covered 5700 nautical miles			1
and if you 're imagining us in an ice - breaking ship , think again			2
this was all done in a rigid inflatable boat , making us the first crew ever to navigate the @entity1 in such a vessel			1
as if creating that piece of @entity7 history was n't a thrilling enough prospect , the encounters the journey threw up -- from rescuing a fellow explorer ( and his dog ) from an ice choke , to stumbling across the possible remains of legendary @entity7 explorer captain @entity40 -- made the expedition truly unforgettable			1
both those incidents , however , were reminders that in the excitement and adrenaline of adventure , it is easy to forget the all - too - real dangers that the @entity51 has for centuries presented to those who take it on			0
ice chokes , growlers ( floating icebergs ) and freezing winds during the day , and turbulent seas when night fell ( with a member of a team knocked unconscious during a particularly heavy storm ) served as a constant reminder that we were very much at the mercy of the environment			2
standing guard with a shotgun during an overnight stop at @entity70 , scanning the horizon for grizzly bears , certainly brought that feeling home for me			0
perhaps the most frequent emotion i felt , however , was amazement at seeing up close the reason that brought me to the @entity7 in the first place			0
the expanses of ice - strewn water in the passage are an incredible sight , but they are also a brutal reminder of the climate change that has so changed this landscape			1
there is a certain irony that the isolated seas of the @entity51 , the very outer limits of the populated world , should represent a universal concern for the world as a whole			0
in embarking on the trip , we each knew the challenges that we would personally confront , but in the shifting ice we saw a vivid metaphor for maybe the biggest challenge facing all of us			0
it is now almost unanimously acknowledged that industrial development and rapid population growth has modified the environment in which we live , and some of the changes in global climatic conditions are already obvious			0
nowhere is this more poignant that the @entity1			1
until 30 years ago this series of very deep channels that wind through @entity110 's @entity109 was frozen all year round			2
in the last few years , however , changing climate has caused the ice to thin and melt , and during the summer months it is now possible to cross from the @entity115 to the @entity116			1
in 10 years , the legendary passage could be open sea this is why @entity120 decided to back the expedition			0
whilst raising awareness about the effects of global warming and fundraising for charity , we hoped we were also able to promote the role of businesses in reversing -- or at least slowing down -- the global warming process			0
crossing the @entity1 you understand why this is just the beginning of what has to be done .			2

expedition through @entity1 showed *declining* *glaciers*
journey through *islands* north of @entity110 covered 5700 nautical miles and lasted 14 days
changing climate has melted ice making it possible to cross from @entity115 to @entity116 during summer
