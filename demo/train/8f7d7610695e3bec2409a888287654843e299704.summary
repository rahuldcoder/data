@entity0 -- " everything i do is centered around women , " says @entity2			1
as founder of the @entity9 , the @entity6 and the @entity7 , it 's fair to assume this is no exaggeration			1
" plenty of women are confident and talented but they still need champions ; they need mentors , " she explains			1
and , since emigrating from @entity16 to the @entity17 34 years ago , @entity2 has become just that -- earning herself an obe from @entity20 for services to women along the way			1
to mark this year 's @entity25 we asked her which extraordinary women she believes are under - acknowledged for their achievements			1
from an empress to a humble florist , in her own words @entity2 presents her five unsung heroines @entity32 ( 1915 - 2000 ) , politician , diplomat and author @entity32 was a woman before her time			1
her autobiography " from @entity37 to @entity38 " is a mesmerizing tale of a fearless @entity41 woman who fought her way from veiled to valiant			2
@entity43 grew up in a society where women were not encouraged to have an education , but she ignored this culture and went on to become the first @entity41 woman to receive a phd from the @entity50			1
she was one of very few @entity41 women to take part in the @entity54 movement and witness first hand the fall of the @entity17 empire			1
she became a member of @entity54 's parliament , an ambassador to @entity61 and her country 's delegate to the @entity64			2
this would have been a colossal feat for any woman at that time , let alone a @entity54			2
she also found time to be a mother of four and was a role model to millions			2
her book " behind the veil : ceremonies , @entity78 and colour " is a collection of essays on @entity41 society from a woman 's perspective			2
it was published in 1953 but is still a crucial work for a country where , in my opinion , women are not given as much opportunity to progress as they are across the border in @entity16			1
@entity88 ( 1886 -1960 ) , educator , florist and author my mother used to enter flower arranging competitions in @entity94			1
she learnt everything she knew from @entity88			2
in fact , the only book i brought with me from @entity16 was my mother 's " @entity98 "			2
@entity88 had many strings to her bow -- this is also the woman who invented coronation chicken ! she created the dish when catering for foreign delegates at the coronation of @entity20 the role of women was at the core of what she did			1
during both the @entity113 she gave frequent lectures , teaching women about first aid , cookery , dressmaking and how to grow your own vegetables in times of austerity -- all priceless tools for empowerment			1
but for me her flower arrangements are still her greatest achievement			0
after all , a beautified life is one full of spirit			0
@entity130 ( 1864 - 1948 ) , founder of @entity131 as a daughter and a mother to two sons , i really believe in the commemoration of motherhood			1
a lot of people forget to thank their mother , but thanks to an @entity143 woman called @entity130 , who successfully campaigned to make @entity131 a national holiday nearly 100 years ago , we have this day to remind us			1
sadly , before her death , @entity145 became disenchanted by the commercialization of her own accomplishment			0
she is recorded as saying that " a printed card means nothing except that you are too lazy to write to the woman who has done more for you than anyone in the world			0
" it 's true that @entity131 has become far too commercial			1
we should n't need a calendar date to acknowledge our mothers , but if it acts as a reminder of how pivotal mothers are then so be it			0
empress @entity164 ( 1835 - 1908 ) , empress of @entity165 she may have been barbaric , some even say a despot , but i still see her as a heroine			1
@entity164 was an indigenous girl , an outsider who went from lowly concubine to @entity165 's leader for 47 years			0
it 's a rags to riches tale like no other			0
in a time when a childless @entity165 woman was expected to kill herself as a mark of respect , she went on to be the most powerful female ruler @entity165 has ever had			0
yes , she may have resorted to machiavellian tactics to get there but she managed to command a respect that no woman in @entity165 had ever achieved before			0
her resolve , resilience and tenacity should act as inspiration to any woman fighting against the odds			0
@entity189 ( 1906 - 2000 ) , philanthropist and fourth wife of @entity191 i grew up in an @entity194 community so we followed the @entity191			0
i always remember people talking about his @entity198 wife , @entity197 ( originally @entity200 ) , with great compassion			0
they came to my parent 's wedding in @entity94 -- she was wearing a sari and a mink			0
i had never seen anyone wear a mink before			0
it is extraordinary that a glamorous @entity210 woman managed to integrate so well into @entity194 society -- she had such an empathy with the community			0
she was an unlikely national treasure but we loved her like @entity17 loves @entity216 -- she was always out in the community helping the poor and elderly and would relentlessly encourage education for women			2
her legacy remains in the @entity221 , whose programs have contributed to health , education and inclusion in some of the poorest areas of @entity226 , where her and the @entity191 are buried			0
the opinions expressed in this story are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity231 is an *entrepreneur* , public *speaker* and leading *advocate* for women
we spoke to her in the lead up to @entity25
her unsung heroines include an empress , politician , florist , and the founder of @entity131 .
