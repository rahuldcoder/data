@entity0 -- @entity2 sued her employer for alleged gender discrimination			1
three weeks later , the company fired her fiancé , citing " performance issues			0
" the couple then sued , claiming job retaliation for the original complaint aimed specifically at the man			0
on monday , the @entity13 @entity12 handed down a unanimous ruling favoring the couple and concluding that federal protections can include third - party victims of retaliation			1
in an 8 - 0 ruling , the high court said @entity22 had " standing " to file his own lawsuit to address the injuries he said he suffered as a result of the retaliation			1
" accepting the facts as alleged , @entity22 is not an accidental victim of the retaliation -- collateral damage , so to speak of the employer 's unlawful act , " justice @entity27 said			1
" to the contrary , injuring him was the employer 's intended means of harming @entity37			1
" the decision allows @entity22 to continue his lawsuit against @entity41 - based @entity40			1
the case began when @entity2 , one of just a few female engineers at the plant , filed a gender discrimination claim in february 2003			0
she alleged that male supervisors treated her unfairly			0

he then filed his own separate retaliation claim			0
lower federal courts were divided over whether he could pursue such a lawsuit			0
a federal appeals court in @entity62 , @entity63 , ultimately dismissed the case , concluding that @entity22 did not himself engage in any " statutorily protected activity , " such as protesting his fiancée 's treatment or assisting in her complaint			1
@entity22 and @entity2 are now married			2
there was no immediate comment from them or the company to the ruling			0
the @entity76 administration had supported @entity22 , and then - solicitor general @entity77 had filed supporting legal briefs in the appeal last year			1
she has since been named the @entity12 and recused herself from the case to avoid an appearance of conflict			2
at oral arguments last month , both the company and the couple agreed that @entity37 had the right to file her lawsuit alleging that @entity22 's firing was retaliation			1
the company denied the specific claims and said @entity22 himself could not bring the separate lawsuit			2
@entity27 , in an eight - page opinion , concluded that the case for @entity97 was clear - cut			1
the anti-retaliation provision in @entity47 is " worded broadly , " he said			0
" we think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fiancé would be fired			0
" in a concurring opinion , justice @entity104 added a " fortifying observation " : that @entity55 rules clearly give @entity22 -- even though he was not married to @entity108 -- the right to press his allegations in court			1

president @entity76 , in the first bill he signed when taking office in 2009 , signed the @entity124 into law			0
it nullified the high court decision and said every new paycheck received over the years based on a discriminatory act -- regardless of when the first discrimination occurred -- would extend the statute of limitations 180 days			0
