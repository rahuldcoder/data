-- @entity1 stands at the pinnacle of sumo wrestling like a colossus			0
@entity1 is one of sumo 's most successful , and most controversial , wrestlers			1
but the 330 - lbs @entity7 , sumo 's most successful ever grand champion , has not been able to rise above the scandals and tragedies that have beset @entity13 's national sport in recent years			1
@entity1 , whose real name is @entity15 , grew up in @entity7 , where both his elder brothers and father were successful wrestlers			1
moving to @entity13 as a student he was spotted and trained by the @entity20 stable and made his professional debut at the age of 18 in 1999			0
winning his first tournament , or basho , in 2002 , his rise up the rankings culminated in him attaining the highest position of @entity28 , or yokozuna , in january 2003 , becoming only the 68th yokozuna in the sport 's 2,000 - year - old history			2
two years later , he set a new record by being the only man to win all six official tournaments in one year			0
while @entity1 's meteoric rise to the top was seen by many as reinvigorating a sport that had seen a decline in homegrown wrestlers and popularity , his success in the dohyo has not pleased everyone			2
some have complained that his wins are too routine , and purists grouse that he does not poses the quality of " hinkaku , " the dignity and calm expected in a yokozuna , or give the sport 's traditions the necessary respect			2
in 2003 he was disqualified from a bout for pulling on the top - knot of an opponent , and has gained a reputation as the enfant - terrible of sumo			0
regardless of the criticisms of @entity1 's wrestling style , sumo 's reputation as a noble sport of tradition has suffered from a number of scandals in recent years and exposed it as just as susceptible to the problems faced by other sports			1
with deep links to @entity13 culture going back to when sumo was part of the @entity79 religious rituals , the sport 's troubles have almost represented a national identity crisis			1
following the banning of three @entity86 wrestlers for using recreational drugs in september , the sport 's chairman and former - wrestler @entity81 resigned			1
it came after a period of years in which a number of match - fixing allegations were made , some directly implicating @entity1 , and plunging the sport into yet another crisis			1
in january 2007 he was accused of bribing other wrestlers to lose bouts , compounding the view that corruption was prevalent in the sport			2
problems for @entity1 continued in 2007 when he was suspended by the sumo wrestling federation for allegedly faking a doctor 's note and was restricted from leaving his house in @entity104 , leading to reports of a nervous breakdown			0
mental as well as physical strength are necessary to reach the top of the sport , but while the punishing physical routine and " hazing " in the training stables has been known and accepted , tragedy struck earlier this year			0
@entity114 , a 17 - year - old sumo trainee , died in brutal circumstances , allegedly beaten to death by his stable - master and three fellow sumo wrestlers			0
continuing to make his mark in the dohyo will be @entity1 's aim for the rest of the year , while sumo hopes it can recover its own poise .			0
