-- @entity1 has never dwelled in yesterday , even if he remembers it quite well			1
at 71 , he 's just released his 24th post-beatles album , " new , " and is generating music at a pace that puts artists a quarter of his age to shame			1
and in a remarkably candid cover story by @entity11 contributing editor @entity12 ( on newsstands friday october 25 ) @entity1 discusses the drive that keeps him creating fresh music — as well as the memories of his @entity17 bandmates that continue to shape his life today			1
look back at @entity1 's remarkable career in photos perhaps most shockingly , @entity1 reveals that although he 's always teaming up with fresh talent — " new " features production by @entity24 collaborator @entity23 , @entity26 producer @entity25 , @entity27 ( son of legendary @entity17 producer @entity29 ) and frequent @entity31 partner @entity30 — he also consulted with another source , someone who knows his music intimately : @entity35			1
" if i 'm at a point where i go , ' i 'm not sure about this , ' i 'll throw it across the room to @entity35 , " @entity1 tells @entity36 " he 'll say , ' you ca n't go there , man			1
' and i 'll say , ' you 're quite right			2
how about this ? ' ' yeah , that 's better			2
' we 'll have a conversation			2
i do n't want to lose that			0
" see where your favorite tracks rank on @entity11 's @entity17 songs @entity1 also reveals that his long - bitter relationship with @entity35 's widow @entity55 has turned a corner			1
describing @entity55 as a " badass , " he says he 's moved on			1
" i thought , ' if @entity35 loved her , there 's got to be something			1
he 's not stupid , ' " @entity1 says			2
" it 's like , what are you going to do ? are you going to hold a grudge you never really had ? " in fact , another voice from the past — that of @entity67 — had encouraged him to forgive and forget			0
" @entity29 would say to me , ' you do n't want stuff like that hanging around in your life			0
' " but despite his spirit of reconciliation , @entity1 maintains there 's one person he will never forgive : @entity35 's murderer , @entity76			1
" i think i could pretty much forgive anyone else , " he explains			2
" but i do n't see why i 'd want to forgive him			0
this is a guy who did something so crazy and terminal			0
why should i bless him with forgiveness ? " @entity1 : the 1974 @entity11 interview though he 's willing to reflect on the past , @entity1 remains firmly focused on the future			1
part of his motivation to continue recording and playing marathon live shows comes from a fear of becoming complacent			0
" i 've always got the critic in my mind , " he tells @entity11			0
" he keeps me on my toes — ' do n't get too blasé about it			0
' i do n't want to become too smug , to think i 'm great			0
