-- @entity2 's remarkable nine - year unbeaten home league record came to an end on saturday as @entity4 suffered a shock 1 - 0 defeat by @entity7 which allowed @entity8 to take an eight - point lead in @entity11 's @entity10			1
the @entity13 coach had not lost a home match since february 2002 , a 150 - match streak taking in his trophy - laden stints with @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and now @entity4			1
his injury - hit team took to the field without top scorer @entity23 , in - form striker @entity24 , defender @entity25 and suspended key midfielder @entity26 , though @entity28 forward @entity27 made a welcome return as a second - half substitute after back surgery			2
former real star @entity23 was honored at the @entity32 before the match to farewell the club 's fans following the @entity38 legend 's recent retirement , but @entity7 -- placed a lowly 15th before kickoff -- ruined their hopes of an anticipated routine victory			1
those expectations rose when @entity43 had the ball in the net in the fourth minute , but the veteran @entity47 defender was ruled to be offside			0
@entity48 , formerly at @entity4 's local rivals @entity49 , scored the only goal with a low shot that went in off the post in the 78th minute as @entity4 were left to rue a series of missed chances			1
@entity2 must now decide whether to bring back @entity23 for tuesday 's @entity55 quarterfinal first leg at home to @entity59 club @entity58 , with @entity4 's hopes of a domestic crown all - but over with eight rounds to play after a similarly - depleted @entity8 side scraped a 1 - 0 win over @entity65 in saturday 's late match			1
" we will have chances to win against @entity58 if we play a solid game and do n't have problems in attack			0
it would n't be dramatic to draw against them at home , " @entity2 told @entity4 's website			1
" luck plays a role in this game and our opponent had all of it tonight			0
our only problem was the absence of creative players			0
@entity26 will play on tuesday and he 's the only one who can change our style a little			0
" we can earn a different result on tuesday with the same players			0
@entity23 will play if he and his coach decide to take a risk			0
the decision of risking it belongs only to him and to me			0
" @entity8 started the match at @entity65 with top scorer @entity92 on the bench after missing @entity28 's midweek friendly due to an injury worry , while captain @entity98 , key midfielder @entity97 , winger @entity96 were ruled out along with veteran @entity100 defender @entity99			1
stand - in skipper @entity101 kept his side in the match with some important first - half saves , but the match turned when coach @entity107 brought on @entity92 for midfielder @entity108 seven minutes after the interval			2
the winning goal came , however , from an unlikely source in the 67th minute as central defender @entity112 showed good skills to chest down @entity115 ' header from @entity117 ' corner and volley into the net despite suspicions of handball			0
@entity101 came to @entity8 's rescue with five minutes to play as he did well to block a goalbound shot from midfielder @entity123			1
@entity8 will return to the @entity124 on wednesday for the @entity55 quarterfinal tie at home to top @entity128 side @entity127			2
@entity65 lost third place after @entity130 won 4 - 2 at @entity131 earlier in the day , bouncing back from two successive defeats as @entity133 scored all four goals against his former club			1
the @entity4 side led after 12 minutes through @entity137 , but @entity133 leveled a minute after the break from @entity140 's pass			2
the striker made it 2 - 1 on 64 from a @entity144 assist and clinched his hat - trick soon after , while @entity140 was again his provider in the 77th minute			0
@entity147 scored a late consolation for @entity131 , who have slumped to 14th place -- five points above the relegation zone -- after winning just once in 14 games .			2

@entity8 's lead grows to eight points after @entity4 's defeat by @entity7
real coach @entity2 suffers his first home league reverse in nine years
@entity8 , also hit by injuries , edge a 1 - 0 victory at fourth - placed @entity65
@entity130 *reclaim* third as @entity133 scores four goals against former club @entity131
