three teenage @entity1 girls suspected of traveling from @entity2 to @entity3 with the goal of joining @entity5 are now believed to have made it to their target country -- war - torn @entity9 -- @entity2 's @entity11 said tuesday			1
police did n't elaborate , other than to say in a statement that they " now have reason to believe that ( the girls ) are no longer in @entity3 " and have crossed into neighboring @entity9 , parts of which have been taken over by the @entity20 terror group			1
if true , that would unsuccessfully end @entity1 and @entity3 authorities ' efforts to find the teens in @entity3 before they could cross the @entity3 - @entity9 border			1
@entity1 police announced last week that three east @entity2 classmates -- @entity28 , 15 ; @entity29 , 16 ; and @entity30 , 15 -- had flown aboard a @entity32 plane from @entity2 's @entity33 to @entity34 on february 17			1
the next day , police contacted foreign liaison officers at the @entity39 in @entity2 , a @entity36 spokesman said			0
a @entity1 counterterrorism officer said police had been " reaching out to the girls using the @entity3 media and social media " in an effort to persuade them to return home			2
the girls ' parents also publicly begged for them to come home			0
earlier tuesday , a top @entity3 official blamed @entity1 authorities for the girls ' disappearance			1
" it is condemnable and shameful on the part of @entity1 that three girls can just go from @entity62 to @entity34 , " deputy prime minister @entity53 told reporters in @entity55 on tuesday , naming a different airport of departure than @entity1 police			1
@entity53 accused @entity1 authorities of waiting three days before telling @entity3 counterparts that the missing girls had flown to @entity34			1
that would be two later than @entity1 police had said , though it 's not clear exactly when top officials in @entity3 -- not just at its embassy in @entity69 -- learned what was happening			2
" the search efforts are ongoing			0
if we can find them , great			0
if not , then it is the @entity1 authorities who are responsible , not @entity3 , " @entity53 added			0
in the days before they left for @entity3 , at least one of the three girls allegedly contacted a young woman , @entity78 , who left her home in @entity80 to travel to @entity9 in 2013 and is accused of seeking to recruit others via social media			1
@entity83 , an attorney for the @entity85 family , told @entity6 on tuesday that the family was " somewhat surprised , horrified " that that contact had not prompted police action , " because they understood that @entity91 's social media content was being closely monitored by the security services in this country			1
" " and the real concern that arises is that if a known member of @entity5 who 's now a poster girl for @entity5 , seen to be recruiting and spreading propaganda , is in touch with young people in our country -- that one would expect the courtesy of a knock on the door of these families , to advise them that their children may be on the cusp of radicalization or going off to @entity9			2
" the @entity85 family released a statement over the weekend in which they condemned their daughter 's actions , saying : " your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of @entity118			0
" but they also said the @entity1 security services " have serious questions to answer " over their failure to intervene after one or more of the missing girls was in touch with @entity91 via @entity125			1
" sadly despite all the government 's rhetoric on @entity5 , if they can not even take basic steps to stop children leaving to join @entity5 , what is the point of any new laws ? " the statement asked			0
@entity83 also queried how the three girls were able , as unaccompanied minors , to go through airport security controls and board a flight to @entity3 -- known to be a transit route to @entity9 -- without any questions being asked			1
despite their condemnation of her actions , @entity78 's parents still hope she will return safely one day			0
she remains in intermittent contact with them through social media but wo n't answer questions , @entity83 said			2
her messages are mostly " extremely religious " in nature and justifying what she 's doing			0
" they are just literally hanging on to her words , hoping that she 's alive when the contact comes through , that she has n't been killed by a drone or a bomb or whatever , " he said of her parents			0
@entity3 has become the most traveled route for volunteers trying to join @entity9 's many armed factions since an anti-government uprising erupted in @entity9 more than three years ago			1
initially , @entity55 maintained an " open door policy , " allowing hundreds of thousands of @entity9 refugees to flee to safety in @entity3			1
at the same time , @entity3 border guards looked the other way , taking few steps to stop activists , volunteers and journalists from crossing into @entity9			2
but with the rise of the ultra-violent @entity20 group @entity5 in @entity9 , the @entity3 government increasingly came under criticism at home and abroad for not doing enough to stop jihadists from going through @entity3 to get into @entity9			2
some critics have accused @entity55 of actively supporting @entity5 against rival @entity177 rebel groups , charges the @entity3 government has angrily denied			0
last year , the @entity3 government showed @entity6 new barricades , thermal cameras and fences aimed at better fortifying the border			0
historically , the @entity3 - @entity9 border , which runs more than 800 kilometers ( 500 miles ) , has been notoriously difficult for @entity3 security forces to control			1
before the @entity9 civil war , both smugglers and @entity177 separatist guerrillas were known to operate illegally between the two countries			0
@entity3 government officials have bristled in response to accusations that they are not stemming the flow of foreign fighters joining @entity5			0
millions of tourists visit @entity3 every year , where visas can be obtained upon arrival for citizens of many countries			0
in a report on border security released last year , the @entity3 prime minister 's office said , " it is easier to prevent people suspected of being members of radical groups from entering into @entity3 than it is to prevent them from exiting from the @entity9 border of @entity3			1
" a spokesman for the @entity3 president said @entity1 and @entity3 security forces and intelligence agents are now working together to try to find the three @entity1 girls			2
@entity6 's @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's @entity11 say they have reason to believe girls are n't in @entity3
family of woman who went to @entity9 in 2013 says security services have questions to answer
@entity3 official calls it " shameful " the teenage girls flew from @entity2 to @entity34 , @entity3
