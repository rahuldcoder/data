@entity0 , @entity1 -- soccer has long been a bloody business in @entity1 , but 2010 has proved particularly violent with five deaths linked to the so - called " beautiful game			1
" among the dead were two former bosses of hooligan gangs -- known locally as @entity10 -- associated with clubs in the northern city of @entity13 , but the most high - profile was policeman @entity15			0
@entity15 was shot in the head as he tried to separate fighting fans of @entity18 and @entity19 in the city of @entity21 , according to @entity22 , the official @entity1 government news agency			1
a solution has long been sought to end the bloodshed that for years has plagued @entity1 's terraces , but when news emerged of a scheme to offer up to 500 of the country 's most notorious hooligans free trips to the @entity32 in @entity33 , it was met with widespread criticism			1
when the government was implicated , that criticism turned to disbelief			2
the idea was the brainchild of a non-government organization called @entity39 ( @entity40 ) who claimed the scheme would reduce violence by bringing fans together			2
the link with the government was seemingly given credence when prominent hua figure @entity48 -- a man who previously campaigned for former @entity1 president @entity49 , the husband of current incumbent @entity50 -- claimed fans from the barra could become " tools at the government 's disposal " through their activity with the @entity54			1
despite the appearance of banners calling for the re-election of @entity62 at prominent matches , the government steadfastly denied involvement by telling @entity2 there is " no connection whatsoever			1
" however , prominent pressure group @entity67 ( @entity69 's @entity68 ) -- a fans organization committed to increasing transparency and reducing violence in the game -- is convinced the government and the @entity39 are entwined			1
@entity48 has been keeping a low profile after suggesting the @entity39 's offer of @entity32 trips had a political motivation			1
but @entity78 , a spokesman for @entity39 , and a member of the @entity82 barra told @entity2 : " at one point we wanted to get close to the @entity62 government , but they did n't want to have anything to do with us			2
politics does n't interest us			0
i 'm not looking to get elected			0
what interests us is stopping violence in football			1
" @entity48 is not involved in every aspect of our organization			0
he is not there in the stands with us at the stadiums every week			0
he helps us with the legal side of things ; he helped us secure our office			0
but the people who are in charge of @entity39 are us -- the fans like me			0
" @entity105 , undersecretary of the @entity106 of @entity107 , was unequivocal when he spoke to @entity2			0
" there is absolutely no connection whatsoever between the hooligans and the state , " he said			2
" the @entity1 government has never even considered the idea of sending members of the @entity40 ( @entity39 ) to the @entity32 in @entity33			1
" i consider it impossible that any group except the government be in charge of guaranteeing security at football matches here			1
" i really do n't see how this group [ @entity39 ] can claim to be working to stopping violence when we see some of their members causing problems at the stadiums every week			2
what they say they want to do is one thing , but what we see them doing every weekend is different			0
" @entity48 originally claimed that up to 500 football fans could benefit from the paid - for trips , but @entity39 now says between 80 and 100 fans are going and that " each is paying his own way			1
" the confusion is a familiar scenario according to @entity143 , president of @entity67			0
she told @entity2 that her group was " very concerned " about @entity39			0
" the @entity1 government has given them a place in their political structure			1
one of @entity39 's leaders has been quite clear about that			0
" the hooligans have always been involved in trouble at @entity153 in various host countries			0
why would we believe they 'll behave now ? they do n't even do that here -- despite the pact they signed to get the trip in the first place			0
" we are working with the relevant governmental organizations -- but unfortunately it does n't really seem that there is a strong political will to tackle violence in football			1
" @entity105 disagrees and says the government is now implementing " technology " that will allow it to better identify those who misbehave at football matches			1
he also pointed out that the government can not employ the same measures to prevent known hooligans from traveling abroad for matches as countries like the @entity178 can			2
he explained : " in @entity1 , the only way we can legally prevent a hooligan from traveling to @entity33 is if a judge orders him detained or if he is already involved in a legal proceeding			1
but we do n't have the authority to take away the passports of hooligans			0
" one person who has been enlisted by the government to help tackle the problem is behavioral scientist @entity189 , chair of public order management for the @entity192 police academy			0
he has been working in @entity1 for six years , but admits the complex nature of @entity1 football violence makes it a difficult beast to tame			1
he told @entity2 : " we have to look at all the links -- the links between politicians and clubs and fans			0
other interests are the money that is involved and the links that exist between different parties involved , which make the problem in @entity1 much more complex			2
@entity1 needs a tailor - made solution because it is a unique problem			2
" @entity189 did express his concerns over @entity39 's proposed @entity32 deal , though			1
" it does n't sound like a very good idea at all , " he said .			0

@entity1 hooligans are being offered free trips to the @entity32 in @entity33
the deal is through an *ngo* who want a reduction in football violence in return
@entity1 's government has been linked but *strenuously* denies any involvement
*pro-government* banners have been *visible* at *recent* games in @entity1
