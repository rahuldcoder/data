" we 're the biggest shoe - shine company in @entity21 , " he explains without sounding arrogant			1
" in @entity24 we shine about 350 pairs of shoes a day , and about 120 pairs in @entity28 and another 120 in @entity29			0
" in total , @entity22 's @entity31 business has 45 employees across the three major airports , and the boss is now eyeing partnerships in @entity37 and @entity38 , as well as expansion across @entity21			1
on this particularly day , @entity40 , 40 , is wearing @entity41 -- black slip - ons			1
with annual revenue nearing 2.5 million rand ( $ 227,000 ) , his demeanor resembles his feet -- comfortable			1
but things were n't always on such a sure footing for @entity22			0
the resourceful @entity21 had to go through a string of failures to get to where he is today -- a spectacular entrepreneurial journey of risk , belief and reward			1
airborne beginnings long before becoming @entity21 's shoe shining king , @entity40 started his professional career distributing boarding cards for @entity61			1

after a year , he was jobless again			0
failed attempts his mother 's brother took away his job , but @entity40 kept in contact with his farmer clients and soon embarked on his next project : selling the farmers ' eggs to the kitchen of the @entity21 parliament			1
making just $ 6 profit per egg box , this however was not a lucrative operation			0
" i fell behind with payments to farmers , " he remembers			0

" i got 35,000 @entity109 ( $ 3,100 ) in two days , " he says			0
" he took that money and invested it all in a tree - planting company which he then started working for			2
but six months later things went sour , and @entity40 was penniless again and back at square one			1
@entity40 had already experienced hard times , but the year to come was to test his resolve			1
" i needed a steady income , so i decided on a shoe - shining business at @entity28 airport			2
a hungry man ca n't think , and i was starving			0
" he got in touch with his contacts from his airline days and applied for the business space in november 2002			2
the authorities took until september 2003 to give him the go ahead			0
" in that year i sold my car ... i worked as a receptionist for three months			2
i begged and borrowed just to make ends meet			0
" business beginnings before he could start shining shoes , @entity40 pawned his fridge to buy business equipment			1
but on his first day @entity40 and his sole employee arrived to bad news			1
" the supplier i had paid to provide pedestals failed to deliver , " @entity40 remembers			1
" i polished shoes in my lap. " in the beginning , both staff members worked flat out 5am to 9pm every day of the week except sunday			1
" i left the house before my family woke up , and only got home after my young daughter had gone to sleep , " he recalls			2
" but customer numbers soon got a boost after a client suggested that the business name should highlight the personal , chatty aspect of the business			2
" @entity155 " became " @entity156 's @entity31 , " and people liked it -- after just four months			2
the team had grown to five and business was booming			2
big plans success in @entity28 did n't cool @entity22 's ambition , and after a year he got a chance to pitch to the person in charge of all @entity21 airports			1
she liked his idea , and expansion started soon after			0
at its height , the company had 60 employees in five airports across the country			0
today , @entity22 has scaled back to the three major ones : @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity24			0

" while he 's under way now , @entity40 shows no signs of stopping			1
he has his eyes on @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 for expansion , as well as partnerships in @entity38 and @entity37			0
