-- spotting a @entity2 's a few blocks from the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , was the last straw			2
the whole world , it seems , is turning into one homogenous , capitalist playground			2
oh , for the days when travel yielded experiences not available at home , things that inspired travelers to send postcards back home to report , " you will never believe what i just saw ! " to that end , i bring you this " only in ... " column with five exceptional , unexpected and singular things a traveler can find when they know where to look			1
look for future installments on @entity0			2
i 'll start with @entity27			1
this @entity29 city , known for honky - tonks and country music , also happens to have @entity34 's largest @entity33 community , an art gallery that shares its @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 with a @entity40 heiress and a mustard yellow @entity41 ( it 's called " @entity43 " ) that serves a wicked fine sunday brunch from the rear passenger window			2
just in time for the november 6 @entity48 , here are five more things you can only find in @entity27 : 1			1
a full - size reproduction of the @entity53 @entity52 before it became " @entity54 , " @entity27 was known as the @entity55			1
in 1897 for @entity29 's @entity57 , city fathers built a full - scale replica of the real @entity55 ' most famous landmark			2
originally made of plaster , wood and brick , @entity27 's @entity52 was n't meant to be permanent			1
but because it cost too much to demolish , @entity27 decided , " what the heck , let 's just rebuild it with real marble floors			1
" so while the @entity67 in @entity68 and the @entity53 government continue to duke it out over the @entity52 's original statues ( since 1817 , what 's known as the @entity72 , as in the @entity73 of @entity74 who got them from the @entity77 , have been on permanent public display at the @entity67 ) , @entity27 continues to give locals and visitors the chance to gawk at a replica of one of the world pinnacles of classical architecture			1
it 's such a perfect clone that during recent renovations , the 2,500 - year - old @entity53 @entity52 sent an architect to @entity27 's @entity89 to snap photos of its spawn			1
a cinnamon roll that makes international headlines in 1996 , an employee at @entity95 , a popular @entity27 coffee shop , noticed , right before he was about to bite into it , that one of its signature homemade buns bore an uncanny resemblance to @entity102			1
before he could so much as say three " @entity107 , " the @entity104 , @entity105 and even @entity106 ( @entity103 wrote a song about it ) made the bun famous			2
the real @entity102 got wind of the " @entity113 " and even though she reportedly laughed about it , her people sent a cease and desist order			0
although copyright law was probably on owner @entity121 's side , the power on @entity102 's side convinced him and his $ 250 - an - hour lawyer to change its name to " the @entity124			0
" the renamed cinnamon roll was quickly dispatched to a glass - enclosed case in the front of the store , but in 2005 , thieves broke in on @entity130 , making off with the famed confection			0
despite occasional sightings of the kidnapped bun , the $ 5,000 no - questions - asked - reward is still unclaimed			0
an art festival that revolves around the tomato you say tomato			1
i say @entity141 this costume - friendly art festival , an annual undertaking in historic @entity27 's @entity144 , has grown faster than a tomato vine on @entity146			1
hatched 10 years ago as " kind of an accident " by @entity154 and @entity155 , owners of the @entity149 , it has become one of @entity27 's premiere hipster events			1
it features 2,000 square feet of floor to ceiling art interpreting the tomato			1
not only are tomato royalty crowned ( both a @entity161 who march in the parade behind a brass band ) , but there are @entity166 taste - offs , tomato bobbing , tomato beauty pageants and wet burrito competitions			1
that 's where competitors eat burritos as fast as they can while being hosed down by a firetruck - like hose			0
" people come up with a tomato - related idea and we say , ' does it hurt anybody ? great , let 's do it , ' " @entity155 says			2
bushels of art flood in from around the world			0
this year 's winner for @entity186 of @entity187 was retired elementary school guidance counselor @entity188 , whose @entity189 featured columns fashioned from real tomatoes			0
there are also tomato haiku competitions and a tomato song writing contest			2
and yes , there 's a cd featuring , among other top hits , @entity200 's " please do n't throw tomatoes at me			0
songwriting doctors and insurance agents from the airport to the local @entity206 to the 10 a.m. opening of @entity209 's @entity208 on @entity210 , musicians of all stripes croon their lyric - writing hearts out			0
at @entity212 on @entity213 in a restored bungalow once owned by @entity215 , even the nonmusically inclined write songs at corporate team building events put on by @entity218			2
companies such as @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 send normally reserved execs to pen lyrics with songwriters who regularly produce songs for stars such as @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			1
" it 's a blast for these folks who normally wear suits , " says @entity231 , a performer who used to tour with @entity232 , who owns the @entity234 - producing @entity233 with her husband , @entity235			0
" we divide them into teams , each led by a hit songwriter , and then each team writes a song , which we then record			0
even if they ca n't sing , we get them out there singing and even line dancing			0
" after seven years of offering this " @entity251 for suits , " has @entity250 ever plucked out any potential talent ? " ah -- no , but it 's a really great fun bonding experience , " @entity250 says			0
a city tour in @entity257 pink bus the @entity260 -- aka @entity258 and @entity259 -- are the big - hair , blue eyeshadow and spandex behind the wackiest tour in @entity27			1
@entity264 , their 90 - minute comedy tour , rides past many of the city 's country music 's institutions			0
tickets sell out months in advance to people hankering to get one of 32 seats on the sisters ' trash - talking , dirt - dishing , yeehaw - yelling tours			0
lap - size coolers of beer and wine are allowed			0
needless to say , squeezy cheese hors d'oeuvres are also served .			0

@entity53 architecture and a @entity285 keep things *interesting* in @entity27
in @entity27 , a festival that revolves around the tomato is a hipster fave
even corporate execs can be songwriters for a short time
