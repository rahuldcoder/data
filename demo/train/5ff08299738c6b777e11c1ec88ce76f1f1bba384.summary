@entity76 put @entity1 ahead in the 12th minute against @entity77 with a superb volleyed effort and @entity79 doubled the advantage just before the break			2
it might have been an even wider margin of victory as the home side twice hit the woodwork before @entity86 scored the third shortly after coming on as a substitute			0
defender @entity88 added a fourth with 20 minutes to go and @entity89 rounded off the rout with a fifth			0
@entity24 's influence on @entity1 since taking over at the start of the season is also shining through			2
while in charge of @entity96 's he helped them perfect their " tiki taka " style of quick passing -- which was also adopted by the all - conquering @entity101 national team under the @entity102 -- whose death was announced saturday			0
@entity24 signed midfielder @entity104 from @entity96 to @entity1 on taking charge and the value of that acquisition was evidenced sunday as the @entity101 international set a new @entity2 record for touches of the ball against @entity77			1
