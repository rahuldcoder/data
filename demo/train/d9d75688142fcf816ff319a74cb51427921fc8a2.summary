-- @entity1 may have just become golf 's $ 11.4 million man , but the @entity4 insists it 's not all about the money			1
it is perhaps easier to say that after scooping the most lucrative prize in his sport , but the @entity4 insists " at this stage of my career , i 'm playing for trophies			1
" " i 'm not really out there for the money , " the newly - crowned @entity16 champion told @entity0			1
" the money is a nice bonus , but to be able to beat the best players in the world gives me more satisfaction than a nice pay check			1
" the new world no. 4 won the $ 1.4 million @entity23 in @entity24 to finish top of the @entity16 rankings , a position that comes with a cool $ 10 million check			1
@entity1 's three - stroke victory at the @entity30 is the highest peak -- so far -- of a barely believable ascent up the rankings			1
he won the @entity33 in 2009 to reach a then career high ranking of fifth , but an alarming plummet followed and by january 2012 he had dropped to 230th in the world			2
but a standout 2013 has seen @entity1 reestablish himself in golf 's upper echelons when a joint third - place finish in july 's @entity43 was followed by a runner 's up spot at the @entity46			1
@entity1 then finished third in august 's @entity47 -- the year 's final major -- before winning the @entity48 earlier in september			1
" it 's just been an amazing run of play , from the @entity43 through the @entity46 and all the way up until now , " explained the 37 - year - old @entity4			1
" it 's the best season of my career by far and i 've achieved some great things in the last couple of months			0
" i think it says that we do n't give up ... if i ever thought that i was n't going to get back i do n't think i would 've			0
i 'm hanging in there even when times are n't great			0
" i 've got a great support team around me as well , that support me in good times and bad times			0
" bad times arrived in february 2009 when @entity1 became embroiled in the @entity67 financial scandal , an episode which goes some way to explaining his philosophical view on his newly - acquired fortune			2
@entity1 invested a significant amount of his own money in the investment company run by @entity75 , who is now serving a 110 - year prison sentence for running a @entity78 scheme.where investors are offered high returns in a very short space of time			2
the scheme operates on paying off the early " investors " from the cash from new " investors			0
" " it was not a great scenario , " said @entity1			2
" i would n't say it had much effect on my golf			0
of course you 're not going to be happy when you 're involved in a thing like that , but there were a lot of other people who lost money too			0
" after successfully swelling his coffers at the weekend , @entity1 has set his sights on addressing a significant gap in his trophy case			1
" i want to win a major championship , " he added			0
" i 'm excited , looking ahead to next year			0
we 've still got a lot of golf to be played this side of @entity108 and i 've got a good chance to win the money title in @entity111			2
" @entity112 to @entity114 final series is coming up -- four big tournaments -- so i 'm going to try my hardest there to be no. 1			0

@entity1 wins the @entity16 to pick up $ *10m* winner 's check
the @entity4 wins *additional* $ 1.4m for winning the @entity23
@entity1 insists titles are more important than money
the new world no. 4 has set his sights on winning one of golf 's four major titles
