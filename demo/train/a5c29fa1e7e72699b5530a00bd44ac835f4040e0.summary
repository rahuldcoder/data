@entity0 -- the february 26 shooting of @entity3 , a black teenager , by @entity4 , who is @entity5 , has in less than a month gone from a local story to a huge national story			1
as we all now know , @entity3 got into a confrontation with @entity4 , a neighborhood watch captain patrolling a gated community in @entity11 , @entity12			1
their confrontation ended when @entity4 , who is licensed to carry a concealed weapon , shot the unarmed @entity3			1
when the police failed to arrest @entity4 partly because of the state 's strong self - defense " stand your ground " law , the case raised outcries of racial injustice			2
in early march , a few major news outlets began reporting the story			2
by the middle of the month , interest heightened when tapes of @entity4 's 911 call to the police revealed that he had been told by the dispatcher that he need not follow @entity3 , suggesting that he had been the aggressor			1
on march 23 , president @entity34 weighed in : " if i had a son , he 'd look like @entity3			1
" the most telling criticism of how the @entity3 case had been handled came from @entity39 rep. @entity38 , @entity40 , whose involvement in the civil rights movement goes back to the @entity43 of the early 1960s			1
@entity38 compared the killing of @entity3 with the infamous 1955 murder of @entity46 in @entity47			1
fourteen - year - old @entity46 was beaten and then shot for whistling at a white woman , or according to other accounts , saying " bye , baby " to her			2
no one was ever punished for killing @entity46			2
with the publication monday by the @entity54 of a leaked police report supporting @entity4 's version of events , the @entity3 case has , however , taken a new turn			1
in the report , @entity3 is the aggressor , punching @entity4 in the nose and then beating him as he lay on the ground			1
this version of events , questioned by some in the wake of a newly released video of a seemingly unhurt @entity4 in police custody , has been fodder for a counterattack on @entity3 's defenders			1
the @entity74 carried a front page headline , " @entity76 , " above a story titled , " tragedy hijacked by ' race hustlers			0
' " while the facts of the @entity3 and @entity46 cases differ and while what really happened in @entity11 is still unclear , there is a parallel worth keeping in mind -- the announcement that the @entity85 of the @entity86 will open an investigation into the @entity3 case			1
from now on in , it will not be necessary to depend solely on @entity12 and @entity11 authorities			0
the modern precedent for this kind of federal involvement in civil rights violence dates back to 1964			1
that year , the @entity86 took on the prosecution of the men accused of murdering @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , three civil rights workers participating in the @entity100 of 1964			2
it was a project , largely using college students from the @entity103 , that was designed to register black voters and begin freedom schools for @entity47 's black children			0
on the basis of a tip in august , the bodies of the three civil rights workers , who had disappeared in june , were found by the @entity112 buried in an earthen dam in @entity114 , @entity47			0
then in december , on the basis of information gathered from informants , the @entity86 charged 19 men , including a sheriff and deputy sheriff , for conspiring to violate the civil rights of the murdered men			0
the charge , based on laws that had been passed in 1870 in the wake of the @entity126 to protect black freedmen and @entity128 , was the best instrument the @entity86 could rely on at the time			0
the alternative to a federal conspiracy case was state prosecution for murder , but in the @entity47 of the 1960s , no one believed that the state could win such a case or had any real desire to pursue it			1
the week after the bodies of the three men were found , gov. @entity141 , speaking at the @entity140 , delivered a speech in which he declared , " integration is like @entity146			0
if people do n't want it , a whole army ca n't enforce it			0
" @entity141 spoke for the majority of white @entity47 , and in december 1964 when the @entity86 sought to bring its case before a grand jury , the @entity39 commissioner for the @entity151 dismissed the charges against the 19 men , saying that the confession the @entity86 had from one of those indicted was hearsay evidence because only an @entity112 agent had heard it			1
in january 1965 , the @entity86 managed , however , to win indictments from a federal grand jury in @entity164			2
then it ran into another setback when a @entity47 judge , @entity166 , threw out the most substantive parts of the grand jury indictments			0
it took a full year before the @entity170 overruled @entity166 and the @entity86 's case was back on track			0
finally , in october 1967 , the trial began in @entity174 , @entity47 , before the same judge @entity166 whom the @entity170 had overruled			0
the government team was headed by @entity176 , the assistant attorney general for civil rights , who through long experience had come to know how hard it was to win a civil rights case in the @entity181			2
@entity176 understood that he faced a particularly tough challenge , and he made a point of telling the jury he was personally taking the lead in trying the case not because he was experienced in criminal law but because he headed the @entity85 of the @entity86			1
for @entity176 , it was crucial for the jury to understand what was at stake , and he went out of his way to remind them that the defendants were being tried " in a @entity47 city , before a @entity47 federal judge , in a @entity47 courtroom , before 12 men and women from the state of @entity47			2
" in the end @entity176 and the @entity86 did not get the complete victory they wanted			0
but they did get a victory that few initially thought possible			0
thirteen days after the trial began , seven of the 19 defendants , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted			0
it had taken three years to reach this point , but what the @entity86 had established was its ability to win a civil rights case in the @entity181 even before hostile juries			0
the conviction of the seven men was upheld , and they began serving time after their appeal was turned down in 1970			0
today , @entity176 's role is remembered by few people who were not part of the civil rights movement of the 1960s			0
but the case he and the @entity86 won nearly a half century ago lives on , demonstrating that neither local nor state justice need be the last word in the shooting of @entity3			1
with the @entity3 case , the @entity85 has another opportunity to settle justice and if it acts with enough speed , defuse some of the tensions that the killing of @entity3 has raised throughout the country			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			0

state prosecutors have not brought charges in shooting death of @entity3
@entity244 says the news that the federal government will investigate is welcome
he says in 1964 , the @entity85 was able to obtain convictions in three killings
@entity252 : the *current* federal investigation could help establish facts , defuse tensions
