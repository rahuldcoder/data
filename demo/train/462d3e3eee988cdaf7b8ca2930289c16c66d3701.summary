@entity0 , @entity1 -- the hot wind swirls around the human bones and cracked skulls that litter the forsaken desert lands in @entity1			1
the entrance to the bunker complex where @entity10 terrorized enemies in @entity1			1
we are standing in the middle of what was an @entity10 execution site , just outside an intricate bunker complex that the organization used to torture and murder its victims , the bodies left to rot or be eaten by animals			1
from the back of the police truck the opening to the first bunker is barely discernible in the distance			2
" @entity10 came in as a massive force " one of the officers says as we bump along the harsh terrain			1
" they stole our cars , our personal cars			0
they kidnapped two of my brothers			0
they blew up the house over there			0
" in the distance we can see his village -- a set of sand colored homes surrounded by parched farmlands			0
as we approach grubby children chase the truck and then stand to the side , despondent , as the officer points to their home			0
" their father was killed by @entity10 , " he says			1
in 2007 the @entity52 military launched a series of airstrikes that drove out @entity10			1
as we enter the first bunker captain @entity56 tells us they found the floor littered with bodies			1
a gaping hole is evidence of the @entity52 firepower			1
insurgents used the layered and intricate labyrinth of passageways and hatches to carry out summary trials and executions			0
the police show us clothing and shoes , saying they are leaving them in place in case the families of the victims decide to come back			0
the stench of decay still lingers			2
@entity10 has been on the defensive in recent years , notwithstanding spectacular attacks attributed to the group like last week 's blasts in the capital , including suicide truck bomb attacks on the ministries of foreign affairs and finance			1
at least 100 people were killed and more than 500 wounded			2
but the concerted security campaign against the group has forced it to change its structure and strategy			0
according to one man who has close connections to @entity10 in @entity1 and asked not to be identified , the group lost support because it lost the protection of the people			1
" there is an old saying about the basics of war			0
whoever wins the people wins the war			0
so when @entity10 did n't win the people over , it lost its battles , " he explains			1
" @entity10 's strategy of taking control of areas has been abandoned for now			1
their method is propaganda , instilling fear , terrorizing			0
" he adds that the group stopped recruiting over the last six months because of a shortage in funding and increased infiltration			0
" @entity10 is moving towards selecting the elite and condensing its forces rather than expanding			2
the @entity52 nearly defeated @entity10 by cornering it and reducing its operations , " he says			1
but those operations are still deadly , and the war is by no means over			0
" no , the war is not over in @entity1 , a type of battle is over , but there are new battles cloaked in politics			2
now politicians try to pay militias , @entity10 , or armed factions ... in order to eliminate political foes , " the man with knowledge of @entity10 says			2
and @entity10 is still able to send a message to those who dare oppose them			2
the police officers show us blood stains in the desert near the bunkers and tell us how they found two beheaded bodies just a month ago			2
they were identified as being the brothers of two police officers from another city , @entity147			0
meanwhile , @entity10 's global war has sifted to a place it believes it can still win -- @entity150			1
" @entity10 in @entity150 is made up of true believers , those who believe in jihad and fighting , and that 's why they joined , " the man with connections says			1
" as for most of @entity10 in @entity1 's members , they are just looking to benefit themselves , or they join out of resentment for a certain sect or to avenge their families			1
" as for @entity1 's longterm stability , that very much still hangs in the balance			1
he says : " peace will not be achieved by a magic wand or the rhetoric of a politician			0
peace will be accomplished through the will of the @entity176 youth			0
we have to wait for this generation to change ... so that a generation that hates ( the violence ) will emerge			0
" @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report			0

abandoned @entity10 in @entity1 bunker base littered with bones of its enemies
