-- a popular antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections can cause abnormal -- and possibly fatal -- heart rhythms in some patients , according to a new warning from the @entity6			1
the drug , azithromycin , sells under the name @entity10 or @entity10 and is commonly sold in what 's called a @entity10			1
the @entity6 warning comes after the agency reviewed a study on the drug that was published last may in the @entity16 , as well as another study by a manufacturer of the antibiotic			2
the warning is " not the result of adverse event reports related to azithromycin , " according to an @entity6 spokeswoman			0
researchers at @entity24 looked at the records of thousands of @entity27 patients over a period of 14 years			2
they found a 2.5 times higher risk of death from heart disease in the first five days of using a @entity10 when compared to another common antibiotic or no antibiotics at all			1
the drug may cause changes in the electrical activity of the heart , according to the @entity6			2
people with underlying heart problems seem to be especially vulnerable to developing this condition , said @entity40 , professor of preventive medicine at @entity24 and the study 's lead researcher			0
the @entity6 said patients who have low blood levels of potassium or magnesium are at a higher risk			1
patients who have a slower than normal heart rate or are already taking drugs to treat arrhythmias should also be cautious			0
@entity40 told @entity0 it 's unclear why azithromycin can cause heart issues			0
he pointed out that similar antibiotics , such as amoxicillin , have also been found to cause heart arrhythmia			0
@entity58 , which produces the drug , released a statement tuesday , saying : " the majority of patients treated with @entity10 ( azithromycin ) are not affected by this label update			1
" so should people with heart problems stop taking the drug ? not necessarily			0
" this just adds another ' con , ' " said @entity40			0
he said it 's important to ask your doctor the follow questions : how serious is the infection ? if i use a @entity10 could it aggravate any underlying health issues ? are there any other antibiotics that could work just as well ? @entity40 said doctors often prescribe @entity80 because the drug only needs to be taken for five days , versus the 10 - day periods that are typical with other antibiotics			1
drug labels for azithromycin have been updated to include warnings about this risk , the @entity6 said .			2
