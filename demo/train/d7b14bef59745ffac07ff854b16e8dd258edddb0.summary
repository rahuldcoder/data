@entity0 , @entity1 -- a battle over @entity4 launched last week between the top two @entity6 presidential contenders does n't show any signs of quieting down as candidates prepare for round two at the first - ever @entity2 / @entity11 @entity6 debate on monday night			1
the debate , being held at the @entity13 in @entity0 , will also give the six other candidates on the stage a chance to change what many are portraying as a two - person race between @entity20 gov. @entity19 and former @entity22 gov. @entity21			1
it all started wednesday night at a debate at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			0
@entity19 , the new guy in the race and the current front - runner in the national polls , and @entity21 , the previous front - runner in the @entity6 battle , sparred over jobs and @entity4			1
@entity19 stood by earlier comments that @entity4 is a " @entity39 " and that it was a " monstrous lie " to tell young workers that the 74 - year - old pension system would be there when they retire			1
@entity21 fired back , saying that " under no circumstances would i ever say by any measure it 's a failure			2
it is working for millions of @entity44 , and i 'll keep it working for millions of @entity44			0
" angry electorate sustains tea party movement since then , both candidates have swung at each other through e-mail and social media			0
in a radio interview , @entity21 went a step further			2
" if we nominate someone who the @entity57 can correctly characterize as being opposed to @entity4 , we would be obliterated as a party , " he said			2
@entity19 's team fired back , noting that in @entity21 's policy book " no apology , " the former @entity22 governor compared the management of @entity4 to a felony			1
then , the @entity19 campaign started highlighting comments @entity21 made august 24 in @entity67 , @entity68 , 11 days after @entity19 jumped into the race			1
" republicans , like myself , are not gon na cut @entity4 or @entity73 for people who are retired or near retirement , " @entity21 said at a campaign stop			1
" and for the people who say we are , they are demagoguing an issue very much that harms @entity44			0
" as for @entity21 's charge that @entity19 would possibly abolish the popular government program , @entity19 's team says that the @entity20 governor believes that @entity4 must be protected for current beneficiaries and those nearing retirement age			1
the two candidates will once again be standing side - by - side at monday night 's @entity2 / @entity11 @entity88			1
@entity2 and the @entity98 , a leading national tea party organization , are teaming up to put on the event , with questions coming from the moderator , @entity2 anchor @entity96 , as well as from tea party activists , supporters in the audience and voters at locations in @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
" you do n't usually start a campaign by setting grandma 's hair on fire , " says @entity6 strategist and @entity2 contributor @entity104			1
timeline : @entity11 movement " @entity19 needs to make it clear in this debate that he stands by his @entity115 of @entity4			1
he ca n't back off that , " said @entity104 , who was a top media adviser to the 2004 @entity119 - @entity118 re-election campaign and to @entity21 's 2008 bid but is not taking sides this time cycle			1
" but @entity19 also needs to make this clear : the ' @entity39 ' is what he would fix			1
@entity19 needs to reiterate that he has the same position as everyone else on stage : no changes for anyone at or near retirement , but we must save @entity4 for those in the ' @entity39 ' now			1
" monday night 's debate could give @entity19 a second chance to make that point			1
" @entity19 has to continue the momentum largely by showing a bit more polish than he did at the @entity25 debate			2
he had energy and proved he belonged on the stage , but needs to help independents feel comfortable with him , " says @entity140 , a @entity6 strategist who advised @entity141 during his 2008 @entity6 presidential bid			2
he is the author of @entity146 , an online column			0
as for @entity21 , who 's making his second run for the @entity149 , @entity140 says he should " try and continue to plant seeds of doubt in the minds of anyone to the left of the evangelical right that @entity19 can be trusted to be president			1
" @entity104 thinks that @entity21 " has to continue to do what he 's done in previous debates : be steady , presidential and remain unswervingly focused on economics : growth , deficit reduction and jobs			2
" and @entity104 has this prediction : " this debate will be a battle between ' @entity167 ' and ' @entity168 '			0
@entity19 imposed a mandate on 12 - year - old girls , requiring them to get the @entity172 ' sex vaccine ' whether their parents liked it or not			2
a lot of @entity6 will think that is worse than @entity21 's health care mandate in @entity22			1
" any showdowns over @entity4 and the economy will also draw in the other six candidates sharing the stage : @entity44 rep. @entity181 of @entity182 , @entity44 rep. @entity183 of @entity20 , former house speaker @entity184 , former @entity186 ceo and radio talk show host @entity185 , former sen. @entity188 of @entity189 and former @entity190 and former @entity44 ambassador to @entity193 @entity192			2
@entity181 interjected herself into the @entity4 discussion			2
" @entity44 needs to keep its promise to senior citizens , i talk to them all the time			0
my mom is 80 years old , and my dad is 87 , " the congresswoman said in an interview friday on @entity2 's " @entity202			2
" she believes that @entity4 needs to be reformed , but " we have to keep our promises with senior citizens			0
" the debate is crucial to @entity181 , who has dropped in national polling since @entity19 launched his campaign on august 13 , the very same day that she won a crucial straw poll in @entity212 , @entity213			1
she had strong debate performances at presidential debates in @entity68 in june and @entity213 in august , but she did n't shine to the same degree last week			0
" @entity181 must get back into the game , " says @entity140			0
" this may be her last chance to stay in the game			0
" the debate may not be as crucial for @entity183 , who 's making his third bid for the @entity149			0
he has energetic and enthusiastic supporters and has little problem when it comes to raising campaign funds , but for some of the other candidates , a strong performance on monday night could be crucial to driving their fundraising			2
" they need to score some debating points so they can generate enough donations to make it to the next debate and , ultimately , to the point where they qualify for matching funds to pay off debts , " adds @entity140			0
but what makes this debate different is its connection to the tea party , a 2 1/2 - year - old grassroots movement that calls for lower taxes and less government spending and regulations			0
the movement was extremely influential in last year 's @entity6 primaries in the midterm elections , and strong support from tea party activists helped the @entity6 win back control of the @entity253			0
it 's expected that the tea party movement will be just as influential in the battle for the @entity6 presidential nomination			0
" the tea party movement has become a powerful movement in @entity44 politics			0
over the past two years , we have changed the political landscape of @entity264 not only have we had an impact in elections , but we have also affected legislation on a level that no one expected , " says @entity98 chair @entity261			0
" because of these successes , it only makes sense that the tea party would engage in presidential politics			0
we are not going to just accept what the @entity6 wants to give to us			0
the people across @entity44 are tired of party politics , so it will be the people of this movement that will determine the next @entity6 nominee			0
