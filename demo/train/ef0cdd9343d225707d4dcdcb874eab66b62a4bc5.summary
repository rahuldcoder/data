@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 airline will fly a bit over half of its normal flight schedule tuesday , a day after pilots suspended their strike			1
" it will obviously take a few days until we are back to normal , " spokeswoman @entity10 said			1
the airline is planning to fly about 1,000 of its normal complement of 1,800 flights , " plus , where we can , single , additional flights , " she said			1
the airline is hoping to return to its full flight schedule by friday			2
the announcement came shortly after both sides in a pilots strike against @entity1 - based @entity4 , one of of the world 's largest airlines , agreed to suspend the standoff beginning at midnight ( 6 p.m. et ) monday			1
the suspension will expire march 8 , barring an agreement before then , both sides said in a @entity0 labor court			2
" the judge was very clear , " @entity4 spokesman @entity30 said			1
" he recommended the union to stop the strike action and to return to the negotiation table			2
" @entity30 predicted the two sides would reach a final agreement " pretty fast			2
" the pilots ' union previously had said resuming a normal schedule would take time , because the union had to inform striking pilots of the agreement before they could return to work			1
in addition , passengers whose flights have been canceled will have to be rebooked			0
hundreds of flights were canceled monday			0
the walkout by more than 4,000 members of @entity51 , the pilots ' union , began at midnight sunday after a last - ditch effort at negotiations over pay and job security failed , the company said			1
the strike threatened to disrupt travel on more than two dozen partner airlines , including @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
in 2008 , @entity4 was the no. 2 international carrier , with 42.2 million passengers , according to the @entity64			1
the industrial action was the largest in @entity1 aviation history , @entity4 said , and it signaled growing labor unrest across @entity68			1
hours after it started , the union representing most of @entity71 cabin staff voted to strike , but did not set a date			0
on wednesday in @entity74 , a mass public and private sector strike is planned to protest the government 's austerity plan			1
@entity78 @entity61 cabin crews vote to strike in addition , @entity80 civil aircraft staff , including air traffic controllers , said monday they plan to strike tuesday through saturday			1
four unions called for the strike , denouncing a government project to merge air traffic control operations with those of five other @entity68 countries -- @entity1 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , according to @entity94 , spokesman for @entity80 's civil aviation authority , @entity97 , or @entity97			2
the unions are afraid of dismantling @entity97 , @entity94 said			0
under the new proposal , " nothing will change geographically , " he said			0
" the control towers will stay where they are			0
" only the " map of the sky " will change , or the sphere of the controllers ' concern , @entity94 said			0
half of tuesday 's flights at @entity110 , @entity80 's , @entity111 were to be canceled because of the action , he said			1
twenty - five percent of the flights at @entity114 were to be canceled			0
the labor unrest comes as the airline industry is digging out of the worst one - year drop - off in business , according to @entity64			0
" it is the kind of death throes , i guess , of the very strong legacy airline unions , " said @entity119 , a travel expert			0
" now , all the old airlines like @entity71 , like @entity4 , are struggling " to cut costs , he said			2
in 2009 , air carrier revenues dropped nearly 15 percent worldwide after a record $ 535 billion the previous year			0
passenger travel fell a record 3.5 percent and freight fell more than 10 percent , according to @entity64 figures			0
many of @entity4 's pilots have been working without a contract since march and more than 90 percent of the union 's members had voted to strike , a union representative said			1
the union , which is seeking a 6.4 percent pay increase , is also concerned with the airline 's recent buying spree of small regional carriers , such as @entity142 and @entity143 , a practice that it said cannibalizes flights from union - flown routes			1
@entity4 is one of the largest carriers on the @entity149 , a network of 26 airlines that share ticketing and routes for international travel			2
other @entity149 member airlines are : @entity174 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity143 , @entity161 1 , @entity142 , @entity162 , @entity62 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity93 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
