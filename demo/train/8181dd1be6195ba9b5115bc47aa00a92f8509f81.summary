@entity0 -- secretary of defense @entity2 , a career civil servant who has advised eight presidents over four decades , turned to his wife at the @entity9 's official farewell ceremony thursday and said " @entity11 , we 're really going home this time			1
" @entity14 ' promise to his wife was a not - so - subtle reference to his track record of leaving @entity0 and then reluctantly coming back or staying longer than planned			1
now he 's really leaving -- for his retirement home across the country in @entity19			2
most recently , as the president @entity21 's second term was ending , @entity2 made several comments about having a clock in his office counting down the days until he could leave @entity0 when @entity21 left office			1
but after president @entity26 persuaded him to stay , he said he threw the clock away			2
he became the first secretary of defense to serve presidents of both parties , and @entity26 said thursday , " it 's clear you have been one of the best			1
" the @entity9 displayed a surplus of pomp and circumstance for the ceremony on the parade ground just outside the secretary 's office windows			1
on the day before , crews were busy pressure - washing the stone stairs that @entity2 and company would use to come and go from the ceremony			1
and the various military honor guard units were busy rehearsing the precise marching and drills for the ceremony			2
each of the armed services sent an honor guard unit and flag bearers to the event			0
the @entity55 sent its " @entity58 " band as well as its @entity57 in their colonial - era uniforms , compete with white wigs and three - corner hats			0
of course , some things are out of the @entity65 military 's control			0
the heat of a blazing sun was mitigated only by a frequent breeze and unseasonably low humidity			0
still , one member of the @entity71 , apparently feeling the effects of the sun as she stood there in her blue wool tunic , calmly stepped out of formation , walked to the one corner of the parade ground with any shade and sat down			0
by the end of the event she was back on her feet and appeared fine			0
( note to the @entity82 , today is perfect example of why your tradition of wearing lightweight , all - white , cotton / polyester blend uniforms on hot days is very smart move			0
) then there were the planes -- passenger jets taking off every minute or so from @entity91 and flying right over the parade ground			0
while the 19 - gun salute could be heard over the noise , the roar of the engines frequently drowned out the president , @entity2 and even the officer who read the official citation for the @entity100 that president @entity26 awarded @entity2 -- the one surprise event of the day			1
@entity2 purposely tried keep from becoming emotional , choosing to send the troops in the field a heartfelt farewell wednesday by e-mail			1
but he still took time to remember them as he left office			0
" i will think of these young warriors -- the ones who fought , the ones who keep on fighting , the ones who never made it back -- till the end of my days , " @entity2 said			2
perhaps the feelings of the people who have worked under @entity2 for 4 1/2 years was best summed up by a civilian @entity9 bureaucrat sitting in the heat at thursday 's ceremony : " i 'm gon na miss this guy , " the worker said			1
his friend seemed to agree .			0

" we 're really going home , " @entity2 *whispered* to his wife at his farewell ceremony

thursday 's event was marked by blistering heat and *relentless* jet noise
