-- the 1992 @entity1 mark the first games in which @entity3 included @entity5 athletes			1
it was called the " @entity7			2
" the @entity7 comprised a coterie of @entity5 legends , including @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , and of course , " @entity15 " @entity15			2
its claim to the title of best basketball team ever has remained virtually unchallenged for two decades			1
that is , until last week , when @entity21 guard @entity20 suggested this year 's @entity23 team , featuring himself along with @entity5 superstars @entity24 and @entity26 , could beat the heralded @entity7			1
suffice it to say , @entity20 's assertion shook up the sports world			1
the vigorous responses on @entity30 , talk radio and in cyberspace are fierce rebukes directed at the five - time champion for declaring what many commentators , bloggers and pundits deem blasphemous			2
@entity15 laughed when recalling @entity20 's statement , telling reporters that his dream team was too smart and too good to lose to this current contingent of @entity5 youngsters			1
similarly , @entity12 chided @entity20 , arguing that @entity26 , @entity24 and @entity20 are the only @entity3 players good enough to have made the 1992 @entity7 roster			1
the general consensus appears to side with @entity15 and @entity12			0
in informal online polls , an overwhelming majority of the public favored the @entity7 over our current @entity49 in a hypothetical matchup			2
judging by the polls , pundits and prognostications on the issue , few seem to be taking @entity20 's sacrilege seriously			1
in fact , i believe @entity20 's team would not only win , but also win comfortably			1
what makes this social scientist so sure ? there is a general principle within elite performance systems , including everything from @entity66 to world - class modern dance companies , scientific research communities and professional sports			1
in competitive systems that offer participants great incentives , peak levels of performance progressively elevate			2
@entity75 : @entity20 's right : @entity77 ... ' 92 or ' 12 ? simply put , spelling bee finalists , elite dancers , noted scientists , and superstar athletes get better and better over time			1
for example , @entity82 , the founder of the prestigious @entity84 , and @entity85 , the dancing legend who elevated the company to world - class status , would not have been strong and athletic enough to secure spots in the same company if transported a few decades into the future while still in their primes			0
as decades passed , the physicality of the dancers in their company progressed far beyond @entity82 's and @entity85 's capabilities			0
the sports world is no different from the elite world of modern dance in that a whole lot can happen in just a few decades			0
sports science advances , training regiments improve , coaching schemes gain sophistication , conditioning capabilities increase and practice procedures progress			0
as a result of these cumulative advances , athletes become bigger , stronger , faster and better			0
in 1972 , @entity113 was the greatest swimmer in the world , winning seven gold medals in the @entity116			0
but 20 years later , all of @entity113 's record times were not just broken , but shattered			2
in fact , 1992 medalist @entity120 's best time in the 100 - meters freestyle ( long course ) was almost three seconds faster than @entity113 's 1972 mark of 51.2 seconds , a world of difference in the event			1
@entity120 's record was broken by @entity128 from @entity129 , who holds the long - course record with a time of 46.91 seconds			1
in figure skating , a quadruple jump , or toe loop , was inconceivable in the 1970s			0
by the 1988 @entity138 , @entity137 's @entity136 landed the first valid quad toe loop			0
twenty years after @entity136 's pioneer landing , the difficult move is part of the repertoires of most male @entity23 figure skaters			2
today 's swimmers , sprinters , pole vaulters , shot putters , divers and long - jumpers are considerably better than their 1992 predecessors			1
few , if any , athletic records last more than a decade before better athletes break them , and then in the next decade shatter them as a new breed of competitor emerges			2
some records appear unbreakable in certain sports , but the progression in ability can explain why			0
transport @entity161 from the 1990s into today 's tennis circuit			1
could her startling feat of maintaining @entity165 ranking for 377 weeks happen today , when many more women detonate blistering service games , discharge powerful forehands and display dazzling speed and footwork ? to put this into perspective , @entity161 's fastest serve was 112 mph			2
@entity172 ' fastest serve is 127 mph			0
similarly , transport @entity174 a few decades into the future and his record 56 - game hitting streak would have to be accomplished pitted against better defenses , fresh relief pitchers at the end of games , harder fastballs , slicker sliders and increased baseball knowledge			2
the possibility that @entity161 and @entity174 's records may never be broken only speaks to how much competition in tennis and baseball has strengthened			2
although swimmers and sprinters face no resistance beyond water and air , peak - performance feats in other sports must face strong defenses , which only improve as each sport gains sophistication			0
@entity199 scoring 100 points in the era of @entity202 is different from @entity203 having a 100 - point game in the era of @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
today 's @entity210 safeties , linebackers and defensive ends are undoubtedly faster and stronger than their 1992 counterparts			1
football 's all - time leading wide - receiver @entity215 would struggle to get open for a pass when running routes against today 's speedy cornerbacks , just as few @entity210 teams would draft @entity220 and @entity221 if the two @entity223 quarterbacks were transported into the 1990s while in their primes			1
transport any @entity5 legend 20 years into the future and he would have to compete against a new breed of athlete			0
which means we can presume that : @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 , players on the 1973 @entity234 championship team , would be too slow in their positions to help any @entity5 team win a championship in 1993			0
@entity241 would not steal the ball in game 7 of the 1985 @entity244 like he did in 1965 because he is comfortably seated on the bench			0
@entity246 in the 1960s is an indomitable force ; the same @entity246 in the 1980s would be a serviceable journeyman			0
@entity10 in his prime would be too slow to play point guard in today 's locomotive landscape , just as @entity11 would be too slow to guard any of today 's elite small forwards			1
can you imagine @entity254 chasing after @entity3 's speedy guard @entity255 , or @entity11 trying to contain @entity256 ? it would n't be pretty			0
so there you have it			0
the new breed trumps the old			0
today 's @entity66 winner would crush the 1992 winner in a spell - off			1
today 's @entity82 dancers dance like superhumans compared with 1992 @entity82			1
even today 's competitive eaters vaporize hot dogs far faster than yesteryear 's carnivores			1
this year , @entity271 downed 68 hot dogs in 10 minutes , crushing @entity274 's 2002 mark by almost 20 dogs , and two minutes faster at that			0
transport this year 's @entity3 back to 1992 and the heralded @entity7 loses to @entity20 's kinetic crew by a wide margin			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity282 .			0

@entity20 suggests the 2012 @entity23 basketball team would beat 1992 's @entity7
@entity282 : it might be blasphemous , but @entity7 would n't beat today 's players
in elite performance systems , @entity282 says , players break records and get better each year
@entity282 : past record - setting athletes would be hard - pressed to recreate accomplishments today
