a @entity1 woman battling cancer is prepared to battle the state of @entity5 in court for what she says is her right to die on her own terms			1
" i am suing the state of @entity5 to help me achieve a peaceful and dignified death at the place and time of my choosing , " @entity10 said wednesday at a news conference			1
@entity10 has had either leukemia or lymphoma since 2007 , undergoing rounds of radiation , chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant			1
though she 's in partial remission now , @entity10 has seen other friends with terminal illnesses suffer and would like " to have the option of aid in dying in @entity5 , " the lawsuit says			1
@entity10 was joined by physicians , also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit , who want the right to administer aid - in - dying treatments to patients without penalty			1
two of those physicians have been diagnosed with terminal illnesses , offering personal and professional perspectives on the issue			2
" i have a lust for life			0
i may want to stick around for the duration , but i should have a choice , " said dr. @entity42 , a retired obstetrician who is in remission from stage @entity44			0
liner brought up the case of @entity49 , whose decision to " die with dignity , " as she called it , went viral in a video she made of her story and an op - ed she wrote for @entity3			1
her case reignited the debate over patients ' right to decide when and how they die			2
@entity59 's desire to die when she wanted meant she and her husband had to move from @entity1 to @entity62 , one of three states that have " death with dignity " laws that allow terminally ill , mentally competent residents to voluntarily request and receive prescription drugs to hasten their death			1
@entity71 and @entity72 are the others			0
judicial decisions in @entity75 and @entity76 authorize doctors to prescribe fatal drug doses in such circumstances , although the rulings have n't become state law			1
having to move to another state compounded the emotions the family was already facing , said @entity59 's mom , @entity85			1
" moving added so many layers of stress and sadness that i can understand why people who are ill feel they would need to file a lawsuit , " @entity85 said			2
@entity59 , who had brain cancer , died in november 2014			0
the lawsuit , filed by @entity10 , @entity42 and others wednesday , would update the text of @entity95 of the @entity96 adopted by the @entity97 in 1874			1
the @entity98 says , " every person who deliberately aids , or advises , or encourages another to commit suicide is guilty of a felony			0
" the plaintiffs , which include @entity10 and the five physicians , are seeking a declaration that would allow doctors to administer dying aid to mentally competent , terminally ill adults without criminal liability			1
" such choice is at utmost importance for all of us , " said dr. @entity110 , another plaintiff			0
@entity110 has suffered from pancreatic cancer and metastatic disease to the liver			0
@entity118 is the executive director of @entity119 and also represents @entity10 and the physicians			1
@entity121 has spent 20 years working for " end of life advocacy " and has seen many ballot initiatives fail			0
this lawsuit provides a " faster and viable avenue " than traditional legislation that she has seen fail numerous times			2
@entity59 's husband , @entity130 , said the lawsuit is evidence that " so many people are in favor " of giving patients the control when it comes to their end - of - life plan			2
" how people die does n't belong in the hands of a lawmaker or a politician , " @entity130 said			1
his wife 's commitment to the issue , he said , has been the catalyst for last month 's proposed legislation in @entity5 and for wednesday 's lawsuit filing			1
even after her death , @entity130 said he is " amazed and so proud " of his wife			0
@entity151 is the president of @entity152 , the organization that made the video about @entity59			0
she called news of the lawsuit " a wonderful development			2
" " giving people the choice of aid in dying is enormously important for their peace of mind , " @entity158 said			2
dr. @entity164 is a psychiatrist and chairman of the medical ethics committee at the @entity167			0
he said organizations and lawmakers have tried and failed four times in @entity5 to pass legislation regarding " end - of - life options , " usually calling the concept a variety of palatable names such as " death with dignity " or " aid in dying " to distract voters from what the issue really is : " assisted suicide			1
" @entity164 said that most people who consider suicide do n't want to die but are looking to " escape intolerable suffering , " or in the case of those facing terminal illnesses , " anticipated suffering			1
" " modern medicine has other options to help with suffering at the end of life , " @entity164 said			0
@entity164 finds the concept of " suicide as a rational or reasonable option " to be worrisome , as it brings acceptance to what he calls a " public health crisis			0
" he said allowing physicians to legally assist suicide opens the door for insurance companies to potentially prey on the most vulnerable patients			2
@entity130 said that he understands the concern , but that if his experience in @entity62 with his wife was any indication , these aid - in - dying treatments are administered only in very specific cases and only after immense scrutiny of the patient			2
he added : " i do n't think we should base policy in fear			0
" @entity121 said that " in order for a patient to obtain aid in dying , there are many safeguards in place			0
" " these treatments are limited to a small group of patients , " she said			0
@entity5 attorney general @entity222 is listed as the defendant on the lawsuit , as she 's the only one who can overturn a previous law			1
a representative from her office responded with " no comment " to the lawsuit			0
@entity3 's @entity230 contributed to this report .			0

a woman and her physicians sue @entity5 for the right to " die with dignity "
@entity10 does n't want to have to move to another state
the lawsuit would allow doctors " assisting in dying " to do so without *violating* law
