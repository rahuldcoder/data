-- growing up in a small @entity3 fishing town , cricket changed @entity5 's life			1
but his association with the game and humanitarian work has also helped transform the lives of many others			0
@entity5 's stature and shot - making led to comparisons with @entity15 's @entity14			2
" without cricket i would have a small job in my home town			2
my mother is happy to say my name , " he told @entity0 in @entity19			0
his mother 's pride in his success has an extra poignancy as @entity5 's fame in some part helped his mother survive the south @entity30 tsunami on december 26 , 2004			2
she was swept away by the first wave and only by calling out to get attention , saying she was @entity5 's mother , did a rescuer manage to spot her among the debris and destruction and pull her to safety			2
thousands of others , including many of @entity5 's friends and neighbors , were not so fortunate , and the impact that the disaster had on @entity5 's hometown of @entity43 and many other parts of @entity45 is still felt today			1
" even now when many people hear the word ( tsunami ) , they are still scared			0
when my mother hears it , she still ca n't run , " he said			2
after nearly 20 years of international cricket , the 39 - year - old is now just as happy to put bowling attacks to the sword as well as working as a @entity58 goodwill ambassador			1
" coming from @entity45 you need to do a lot of charity work and help in anyway you can			2
people love cricket and they look to cricketers , so as a team @entity45 also does a lot for charity			1
it 's a personal commitment , " he told @entity0			0
on the pitch he has always been just as committed to helping his team			0
making his international test match debut in 1991 , he captained the @entity3 team for four years until 2003 and hit memorable centuries against every other test side , bar the @entity76 and @entity77			1
he retired from the five - day version of the game in 2007			1
however it was in the one day game that the all - rounder has really made his mark			2
as part of the @entity3 team that won the @entity85 in 1996 , he played an explosive innings of aggressive shot - making that has been credited with revolutionizing the way in which batsman play the game			1
in 2005 he became only the fourth batsman to reach 10,000 runs in one - day matches and his current stats stand at 12785 runs from 421 one - day internationals			1
having made his name in the 50 - over version of the game he 's still involved in cricket 's latest revolution ; the even shorter @entity103 game that is being touted as the future of popularizing the sport			1
" @entity106 has changed all over the world			0
for the public to watch this game we need for it to change			0
you can now enjoy all that in around 3 hours ( with @entity103 )			0
the @entity114 ( @entity114 ) is good for cricket and good for cricketers			0
the one - day game will be phased down			1
" throughout his career he 's shown his own resilience adapting to changing circumstances on the cricket pitch as well as off it			1
before the 2003 @entity85 he took the decision not to sign a contract with the @entity3 cricket board , citing the loss of potential earnings it would mean for him and fellow players			1
despite not being a confrontational personality , the tension between himself and the @entity3 cricket board led to his resignation from the captaincy in 2003			2
with no test cricket to play this year , @entity5 found himself omitted from the @entity45 squad for 2008 series one - day series against the @entity76			1
however his fine form while playing in the @entity114 -- he ended its inaugural season as the third highest run scorer with 514 runs and hitting 31 sixes -- convinced the selectors to pick him for the upcoming one - day series between @entity45 , @entity146 and @entity147			1
" looking back i could never have thought i would have come this far			0
@entity149 helped me a lot			0
it says that you should take the middle path and you will never go wrong , " he said			0
" but i 've done a lot of hard work and everyone , my family and coaches , have given me support			0
without that i would n't have got here			0
" when he does finally retire you can expect @entity5 to keep giving all he can to the game and causes he loves so much .			0
