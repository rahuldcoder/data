-- what the heck has happened to @entity3 ? first he flip - flopped on immigration reform			1
in 2006 , sen. @entity3 was a primary co-sponsor of and worked closely with sen. @entity6 to craft immigration reform legislation that included a path to citizenship for @entity11 's undocumented immigrants			1
but faced with a primary challenge from a tea party @entity13 in 2010 , @entity3 denied that he had ever supported a path to citizenship			1
@entity3 subsequently threw his support behind @entity18 state legislation that ostensibly allows for racial profiling of @entity20 and is considered one of the harshest anti-immigration laws in the nation			2
then he flip - flopped on legislation meant to address the dangers of climate change			1
in 2003 , @entity3 was a key supporter of so - called " cap and trade " legislation that would create a market - based solution to limit pollution			1
during his 2008 presidential run , @entity3 boasted of his support for cap - and - trade measures			1
" we stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great , " said @entity3			2
" the most relevant question now is whether our own government is equal to the challenge			0
" @entity3 , it appears , was not			2
by 2009 , @entity3 was calling such measures " cap and tax			2
" by 2014 , @entity3 was blasting secretary of state @entity45 for even talking about climate change			0
and now we have @entity48			0
recently , the @entity50 column of the @entity51 found that @entity3 had flip - flopped on his support for a prisoner swap in exchange for the release of sergeant @entity48			1
the @entity51 awarding @entity3 a rare upside - down @entity56 for his switch in positions			1
in february 2014 , @entity3 told @entity0 's @entity59 , " now this idea is for an exchange of prisoners for our @entity11 fighting man			1
i would be inclined to support such a thing depending on a lot of the details			0
" that was before @entity69 actually made the exchange			0
then @entity3 said he was against it			0
@entity3 claims his objection was based on the details of the five @entity75 prisoners swapped for @entity48 but as the @entity78 pointed out , the details around those five specific prisoners were widely known in february when @entity3 originally commented			1
in fact , the @entity51 ran a front - page story with details about the prisoners			0
@entity3 's flip - flop , like all his others , was nothing more than political opportunism , plain and simple			1
moreover , these are not the only times @entity3 has wildly switched positions on fundamental issues			0
@entity90 , then of @entity92 magazine , produced a thorough list including other flip - flops as of august 2010			1
but it 's somehow especially stunning to hear @entity3 flip - flop on the issue of @entity48 in particular			1
after all , @entity3 is without question a true @entity11 hero			0
and he has been , from his earliest days , a man of principle			0
in 1968 , a year into his imprisonment and torture as a prisoner of war during the @entity104 , @entity3 was offered early release â € ” the @entity106 seeking to gain publicity points after @entity3 's admiral father was put in command of all @entity11 forces in the region			1
he would only agree to be released if every @entity11 taken prisoner before him was released as well			0
it was only then that @entity3 was subject to heinous and severe torture , including beatings every two hours			0
five - and - a - half years later , the principled pow and his fellow soldiers were released and came home			0
they received a heroes ' welcome			0
the @entity122 put a picture of @entity3 's homecoming on its front page			1
it 's important to remember that @entity3 was ultimately released by the @entity106 as part of winding down of the war			2
that 's what happens when you end a war ; you exchange prisoners â € ” even the dangerous ones			0
in the case of the five @entity75 prisoners swapped for @entity48 , even a legal adviser from the @entity140 administration has argued there would be no grounds to continue holding them after the war in @entity143 officially ended later this year			0
and by then , they would n't even be useful as leverage for @entity48 's return			2
certainly @entity3 knows the immense suffering and brutality of being a prisoner of war			2
he also knows what happens when wars end			0
in fact , i like to imagine that @entity3 knows a lot of things including how ridiculous his repeated backtracking seems in light of his own self - proclaimed principled " maverick " identity			2
but these radical shifts in position say less about @entity3 as a person and more about the political party to which he belongs , a party that was for immigration reform and for cap - and - trade regulations and for doing whatever it took to bring @entity169 home up until the moment that president @entity69 took the same side			1
the modern @entity13 is desperately opportunistic and reactionary , trading whatever thin principles it may have once held to simply stand against whatever the other side is for			2
and @entity3 , whether willingly or unwittingly , is at best an illustrative canary in the coal mine or at worst , yet again held hostage -- this time by an increasingly reckless and irrational @entity13			1
update : an earlier version incorrectly listed @entity3 as being awarded the @entity181 .			0

@entity183 wonders why sen. @entity3 gets away with his *constant* flip - flops
he was first in favor of prisoner swap for @entity48 , she says , then was against it
she says @entity3 's flip - flops are nothing more than political opportunism , plain and simple
but the real reasons may be an desperate and reactionary @entity13 party
