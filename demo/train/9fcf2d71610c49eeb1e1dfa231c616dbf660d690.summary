editor 's note : @entity2 is professor of history at @entity4 and the author of " for all these rights : business , @entity8 , and the @entity11 's public - private @entity9			1
" her forthcoming book , " @entity14 , " co-authored with @entity13 , will be published by @entity15 next year			0
@entity2 says government has played a key role in gaining health care security for workers			1
@entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity22 ) -- " we worked hard to get it and we 're going to keep it , " said @entity26 , one of the protesters attending this summer 's health care town meetings			1
@entity26 and her husband @entity32 , retirees from @entity30 , @entity31 , showed up at a town hall held by sen. @entity34 , in @entity35 , @entity31 , with signs condemning socialist takeover of their health care , and she was interviewed by @entity39 on @entity41 's " @entity40			1
" when asked how she had insurance coverage , @entity26 explained that because her husband was a retired coal miner , they received insurance and care through the @entity46			1
she attended the town hall because she said she had " had enough of the government interfering with our lives , after working hard all of our lives , especially to get the health care			1
" the historical reality , however , is that there would be no @entity46 health and retirement plan without the federal government			1
our inability to acknowledge the real role of government plays right into the hands of private companies that have never solved the challenges of health security			1
in april 1946 , @entity68 , leader of the @entity46 , led the coal miners out on strike around a pioneering demand : employer contributions to a union health and welfare fund			2
miners had long suffered debilitating health problems and notorious medical neglect in camps and towns run by authoritarian mine companies			2
for @entity68 , changing the balance of power between workers and owners necessitated independent and guaranteed health security , but the mine owners had no intention of settling			1
facing a strike that could choke the economy , president @entity87 intervened through the @entity90			0
with the mines officially under federal jurisdiction , @entity87 was ready to make a deal			0
the mine owners however were not as eager			0
@entity87 pressured mine owners into signing a contract in which they would pay for a union welfare and @entity98 -- hospital , medical , and retirement plans -- all financed by a royalty assessed on the amount of coal extracted by union workers			2
the @entity105 provided technical assistance in designing the union - run welfare program			0
the settlement was industry - wide , regardless of company , thus equalizing the sharing of risk and the benefits of " social " insurance			2
the @entity105 and the @entity115 recruited staff for the @entity46 program			0
physicians , public health experts , and industrial health experts came from the @entity115 and the @entity121			2
the @entity121 had successfully run rural medical programs during the 1930s and @entity124 through the fund , @entity46 built a network of well equipped , modern hospitals , bringing about a major improvement in living standards			0
over the next two decades , federal subsidy became more direct			0
@entity105 disability benefits and federal rehabilitation programs aided thousands of disabled miners , many of whom had been bedridden for years			2
by picking up the tab for rehabilitation and disability support , the federal government also kept the @entity46 program financially sustainable			2
as employment declined and mining families struggled in the 1960s , mineworkers launched widespread protest demonstrations and traveled to @entity145 to lobby for federal support of @entity46 hospitals			0
presidents @entity148 and @entity149 responded with the @entity150 , the 1964 @entity151 , the @entity152 , and of course , @entity154			0
@entity155 stabilized and expanded the miners ' health system			1
miners were proud beneficiaries of @entity149 's @entity160 -- today so much maligned by the conservative talk show hosts			0
miners continued their pressure , leading to the @entity163 , marshalling public force to protect their health in the private workplace			2
if @entity26 " did not pay one penny " for her husband 's cancer treatment or her surgeries , it 's because government subsidized that care since @entity32 's early days as a miner			1
while she and her husband undoubtedly worked hard for what they have , these were by no means individual or private achievements			0
they represent shared social projects that were fought for and won collectively			0
the entire system of employee health insurance emerged because of direct federal support for unions and collective bargaining during the formative decades of the 1940s , 50s , and 60s			1
the thousands of people who poured into the @entity192 emergency clinic on one august weekend in @entity193 have no health insurance			0
they are suffering like the miners of 80 years ago			0
who will tip the balance of power again in their favor ? health care reform will derail once more if we ca n't learn to talk honestly about public benefits and public goods -- how they protect us from the insecurities and inequities of the market and promote genuine economic security in the face of real imbalances of economic power and resources			1
the only moments when health security has been achieved in @entity215 are those founded on a partnership between empowered citizens and the federal government			1
it 's been the @entity215 way all along			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : town hall protesters opposed changes to health care system
she says some argued against government role in health care
she says history shows government helped secure benefits for workers
@entity238 : government role *crucial* to providing workers with health security
