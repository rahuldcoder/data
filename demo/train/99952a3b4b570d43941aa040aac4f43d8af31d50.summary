@entity0 , vindicated in the murder of a @entity3 newspaper editor , said wednesday he holds few grudges against an old pal whose bogus testimony landed him in prison for a decade			1
in fact , he said , @entity8 should be a free man , too			2
the 29 - year - old conceded he has some hard feelings toward @entity8 -- after all , his 20s were taken from him -- but when asked whether he bore ill will toward the former classmate with whom he was drinking the night of the murder , he flatly called for @entity8 's release			1
" he 's not a murderer			2
he 's been taken advantage of by those in the justice system , " @entity0 said			1
having served roughly a quarter of his 40 - year sentence , @entity0 refused to speculate on whether prosecutors acted maliciously -- despite that two of the prosecution 's key witnesses later recanted their damning testimony and an appeals court judge ruled that prosecutors withheld evidence at trial			1
" they 've taken my 20s , and i 'll never have that back			0
... those are amazing years , obviously , " he said			0
" i 've never really lived as an adult in the free world			0
" the @entity38 released @entity0 on tuesday after @entity3 attorney general @entity39 said he would n't retry @entity0			1
@entity0 and @entity8 , both 17 at the time , were drinking illegally at a college bar early on november 1 , 2001			2
about five blocks away , @entity42 sports editor @entity41 turned off his computer after a late night and walked out to the newspaper parking lot shortly after 2 a.m. , according to court documents			0
@entity41 was struck from behind and strangled with his own belt , according to the documents			0
police found hair , blood and fingerprints at the scene , and a police dog tracked a scent to a @entity57 dorm , according to a website devoted to @entity0 's defense			1
police questioned a janitor , @entity62 , who said he could not identify the individuals involved in the crime , court documents say			0
more than two years later , @entity8 told police he had " dream - like " memories of committing the crime , resulting in his and @entity0 's march 2004 arrest			1
@entity0 told police that he recalled driving @entity8 home that night before going home himself , according to the documents			2
@entity8 implicated @entity0 at trial , as did @entity62 , who had gone to prison himself on a parole violation the month after the murder			1
@entity62 testified that a newspaper article his wife sent him in prison in early 2004 jogged his memory about what he saw that night , court documents say			2
that testimony was key to @entity0 's release , because prosecutors had interviewed @entity62 's wife , who denied sending him the article			1
prosecutors failed to disclose that interview , and judge @entity91 , in a summary of last week 's decision , wrote , " the undisclosed interview was material , resulting in a verdict that was not worthy of confidence			1
" @entity0 found out he would be released when his lawyer came to the prison , holding up a piece of paper behind the protective glass that separates visitors from inmates			1
on it , she had quickly scrawled two words : " it 's over			2
" " i feel like @entity111 or something , " @entity0 said to supporters after his release			2
he said his first stop as a free man might be at a @entity115 , and the profile photo on the @entity118 site was later updated to show a grinning @entity0 in a gray v - neck sweater , sitting at a bar with a beer and a steak			1
now that he 's out , @entity0 said he and his legal team will be looking into the prosecution 's conduct in the case			1
he also said it was " incredibly important " to him that @entity41 's killer be found			1
" i believe we know who did it			0
it 's a matter of proving it and getting help from authorities at this point , " he said , declining to name names			2
" i think the facts show clearly who did it			0
" it 's unclear if @entity0 is entitled to any compensation for his incarceration			1
@entity3 law says wrongly incarcerated people are entitled to restitution , but only if they 're determined to be " actually innocent " as a result of dna analysis			0
though court documents say none of the dna at the crime scene matched @entity0 or @entity8 , the judge cited only the witness 's wife 's interview in overturning @entity0 's conviction			1
" the individual may receive an amount of fifty dollars per day for each day of post-conviction incarceration for the crime for which the individual is determined to be actually innocent , " the statute says			0
@entity0 attributed his grace in this difficult time to his upbringing			2
while in prison , he read , studied and took care of himself while " preparing for my life " and never allowing himself to " look too far into the future , " he said previously			0
he added wednesday that his confidence in his own innocence also helped him survived his decade in prison			0
" i believe in myself			0
i know what i 've done in my life			0
i know what 's right and wrong			0
... i knew someday i would prove my innocence , " he said			0
" i just kept moving forward			0

@entity0 , 29 , released after serving quarter of 40 - year sentence for murder , *robbery*
judge in case ruled that prosecution withheld " material " interview with witness 's wife
@entity0 says of man who helped land him behind bars , " he 's not a murderer "
he says it 's " incredibly important " to find the real killer , to whom evidence points
