@entity1 , @entity0 -- in @entity0 , television is a big deal			1
this is especially true during @entity6 , when networks spend an estimated $ 140 million on tv programming -- a sum nearly matched by what 's spent on advertising			1
" @entity6 is still the biggest tv season			1
it 's the @entity14 of @entity15 , except that it goes for an entire month , " explains @entity12 , a prominent , @entity1 - based film critic			2
it used to be that the plotlines for the myriad soaps and commercials that aired during @entity6 adhered to similar @entity21 © s : family , unity , community , charity			1
lately , with the region in upheaval , @entity6 television has acquired a distinct edge			1
actor @entity30 is a tv and film actor whose @entity6 dramas have helped him shoot to national fame			1
halfway through the @entity34 , he was filming " @entity35 " , or " countdown " , in which he plays a university professor who is tortured in prison and ultimately driven to a life of terrorism			0
" there 's definitely been a radical improvement in ( television ) quality -- aesthetically , narratively , conceptually and especially acting-wise , " says @entity12			0
@entity45 , a former soap star who has since broken into the film industry , found himself playing a similarly meaty role in last year 's movie , " @entity54 " , in which he played a convict who escaped prison during the 2011 revolution			0
though the unrest from that period forms the backdrop of a lot of film and tv coming out of @entity0 , particularly during @entity6 , @entity45 notes that people , not politics , are the main themes			1
" ( my movie ) has a very subliminal message			0
( it 's about ) the people who went to the revolution , and those who did n't go			0
it 's about the conditions of poverty and illiteracy			0
definitely it was n't about revolution , " he says			0
many are taking advantage of @entity0 's more experimental approach to subject matter during the holy month			1
two years ago , @entity87 's @entity86 division ( @entity85 ) ran a series of humorous commercials for @entity90 featuring the country 's most famous soap actors			2
in one , one of the actors gets hit by a @entity90 sign , and is left buried under the ruble			0
@entity97 , the company 's ceo , noted that @entity0 makes it easier to try out new formats			2
" in the @entity102 , you still do n't really have the freedom to explore new ideas when it comes to @entity6 because it 's still a bit more conservative			2
in cultures such as @entity0 , you find a lot more engaging content than anywhere else in the world , " he says			1
as the subject matter matures , many actors are taking @entity6 as an opportunity to prove themselves , and ultimately further their career			2
" it 's a lot of pressure , definitely , " says @entity30			0
" you are competing with superstars and with very professional people , and all this is happening in 30 days , " he says .			0
