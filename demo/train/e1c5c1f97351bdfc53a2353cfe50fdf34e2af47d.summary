-- during the recent @entity6 presidential debate , the issue of vaccinating girls against human papillomavirus , or @entity4 , came up several times , and some statements have been made that may concern parents of children scheduled to receive the vaccine			1
the statements questioned the safety of @entity4 vaccines and the rationale for the recommendations for their use from the @entity18 of the @entity19 , the @entity20 and the @entity21			1
hpv vaccines have the promise of improving the lives of both women and men			0
the recommendations for use of the vaccine are based on scientific data , including safety studies , which indicate that the benefits of hpv vaccines far outweigh any of the known risks			2
the safety record of these vaccines is excellent			0
after five years and more than 35 million doses of hpv vaccines given , all of the available scientific evidence shows that @entity4 vaccines are safe and effective , and that the current recommendations will result in the best opportunity to prevent hpv infection and its consequences			1
@entity4 is the most common sexually transmitted infection			2
studies show that 50 % to 70 % of women will develop an hpv infection during their sexually active lives and that infection occurs soon after they become sexually active			0
although most infections resolve over six to 24 months , some persist and can lead to cancer			0
certain types of @entity4 are responsible for almost all cases of cervical cancer , other cancers of the anal and genital areas and a significant percentage of oropharyngeal cancers in men and women			2
other hpv types cause genital warts			0
in the @entity64 , each year about 12,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed , and nearly 4,000 women die of complications of cervical cancer			0
hpv vaccines are an important scientific breakthrough			0
they prevent infection with the hpv types most commonly associated with the development of cancer and therefore are expected to reduce significantly the number of cases of @entity4 - related cancer in women and men			1
two hpv vaccines are available in the @entity64			0
the first , @entity80 , was licensed by the @entity81 in 2006 for girls 9 through 26 years of age to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts			0
in 2009 , the license was extended to include boys 9 through 26			0
more recent data show @entity80 also prevents other genital cancers in women and anal cancer in both women and men			2
the second hpv vaccine , @entity93 , licensed in 2009 for women 10 through 25 years of age , targets the prevention of cervical and related genital cancers			1
both vaccines were studied extensively before the @entity81 licensed them			0
the rationale for the recommendation to immunize at 11 through 12 is that the vaccine will be most effective if given before a person becomes sexually active			0
protection is expected to last for many years			0
" catch - up " vaccinations to age 26 are also important			0
even though some persons in this age group already will have been infected with one or more of the hpv types in the vaccine , the vaccine will protect them against the hpv types in the vaccine to which they remain susceptible			2
by the time the @entity81 licenses a vaccine , common side effects are known ; evaluation for adverse health effects is an important requirement of the clinical trials that lead to licensure			1
no serious safety concerns were detected during the clinical trials of either of the two hpv vaccines			2
after a vaccine is licensed , a number of systems are in place in the @entity64 to monitor vaccine safety			1
these include the @entity129 , a passive reporting system that can detect early - warning signals about possible new vaccine adverse effects , and the @entity19 's @entity134 project , which provides a database for planned immunization safety studies of possible adverse effects arising from review of those reporting system reports and medical literature			1
but investigation of reports to @entity129 since both hpv vaccines were licensed has suggested that rare serious allergic reactions ( including anaphylaxis ) and fainting spells , which can occur after any immunization , can also occur after hpv vaccine			1
vaccine providers , particularly when vaccinating adolescents , should consider observing patients ( with patients seated or lying down ) for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for injury should they faint			0
a recent study was conducted in @entity19 's @entity134 among females 9 - 26 years of age who received hpv vaccine ( @entity80 )			1
the study found no statistically significant increased risk for any of outcomes studied after vaccination			0
studies on hpv vaccine safety will continue and reports of any rare event occurring after receipt of hpv vaccine will be reviewed			1
) and the @entity170 , part of the @entity172 , recently reviewed reported vaccine - related , adverse events and did not find that data supported a causal relationship of hpv vaccine to any neurologic condition			1
parents have a great opportunity today to reduce the risk of @entity4 - related cancers in their children			2
parents who have concerns about hpv vaccine and some of the statements made about safety should ask their children 's doctors for information			1
the @entity19 has a website that provides accurate , up - to - date information about the safety and effectiveness of hpv vaccines			1
parents would do well to use trusted and reliable resources when making the important decision to protect their children from hpv infection and @entity4 - related cancers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 notes issue of hpv vaccine safety coming up in recent @entity6 debates
he says @entity19 , others say vaccine helps prevent @entity4 , which can lead to cancers
he says vaccine has been *widely* tested and is safe with side effects rare
@entity201 : parents should *listen* to reliable information in deciding to vaccinate their kids
