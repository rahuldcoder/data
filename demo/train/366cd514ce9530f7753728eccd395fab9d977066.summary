-- pope @entity1 sent shock waves around the globe last july when in addressing the issue of gays in the church , he opted not to remind his 1.6 billion followers about the fiery pits of hell but instead posed a question : " who am i to judge ? " not exactly a ringing endorsement for equality , but the rhetorical question was light years away from what we have grown accustomed to hearing from his predecessors			1
and because of that , we felt a glimmer of hope that maybe the needle within the larger @entity25 community had moved from hostile rhetoric to civil engagement			0
in their nearly one - hour meeting this week , @entity1 and president @entity29 reportedly spent the bulk of their time discussing empathy			1
" it 's the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars , " the president said afterwards			1
presumably he was referring to military wars , though that sentiment is obviously applicable to the culture war as well			0
for only a lack of empathy could prompt officials at a @entity25 school in @entity48 to suggest an 8 - year - old girl attend a different school because she was n't behaving in a feminine enough way to stay at theirs			1
( the school says it ca n't provide details because of confidentiality , but " this matter is far beyond a simple ' hairstyle and tomboy issue ' as inaccurately portrayed			1
" ) only a lack of empathy could lead catholic school officials to fire a beloved teacher for planning to marry the love of his life			2
lack of empathy explains how " the " @entity67 's " @entity66 can be flippant about stoning gay people to death in the days of @entity70 , or how @entity71 -- @entity73 's son -- can suggest that @entity75 people might adopt children in order to " recruit			1
" all of these incidents occurred after @entity1 asked " who am i to judge ? " as if ostracizing an elementary school tomboy was the best answer some of the @entity25 faith had to that question			1
on the day the story of the little girl made national headlines , @entity88 , lead singer for the @entity25 band @entity89 , tweeted , " why do i find myself regularly shaking my head , or rolling my eyes at supposed @entity25 leaders			0
" he followed with , " i am learning that love 's most potent manifestation happens when we make room at the table for everyone			0
" @entity88 's remarks were refreshing , because many @entity100 in his position prefer silent disapproval in response to over-the - top quotes and head - scratching stories like the one involving the little girl			0
if you 're curious why more and more people are leaving the church , maybe it 's because they hear " love the sinner but hate the sin " from the pulpit -- and then see so many followers go about their day as if simply saying the word " love " excused them from actually having to show any			2
many followers of @entity117 may find silence on this topic easier , not noticing silence is being interpreted as endorsement -- whether they agree with the anti-gay rhetoric or not			2
for each time " who am i to judge ? " is asked , an anti-gay quote from the @entity125 's @entity124 is there to answer			1
to move pope @entity1 ' question from a global headline to global change , @entity100 must stop allowing silence to be the @entity133 weapon of choice against the senseless persecution of gay people			1
forty percent of the country 's homeless youth identify as @entity75 , with nearly half kicked out of their homes by those who are supposed to love and care for them			0
there 's a sermon topic we do n't hear every week -- but we should			2
slave owners used to start and end each service on the plantation with @entity148 -- " servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto @entity117			0
" " who am i to judge ? " was not enough to change that			2
women were once compelled to stay with abusive husbands with the words " wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the @entity166			0
" " who am i to judge ? " was not enough to empower women and get the legal system to prosecute their assailants			2
it was in such silence that laws in @entity174 were originally drafted to make being gay punishable by death			1
laws that found validation from the ties some @entity174 politicians had to well - known @entity180 evangelicals who regularly visited the country			0
the evangelicals have since distanced themselves from the anti-gay politics of @entity174			0
not because of some moral stirring within their soul but because they were called out on it			0
cardinal @entity187 -- when asked about @entity190 prospect @entity188 coming out of the closet -- said on @entity193 's " @entity192 , " " the same bible that tells us -- that teaches us well about the virtues of chastity and the virtue of fidelity and marriage also tells us not to judge people			1
" it 's a truism ignored way too often by anti-gay @entity25 leaders			0
a truism that is n't reiterated enough by those who follow them .			1

pope @entity1 and president @entity29 discussed the *importance* of empathy
@entity211 says the @entity1 was right last year when he said : who am i to judge ?
sadly , he says , many others do n't follow that teaching
@entity211 : do n't answer the persecution of gay people with silence
