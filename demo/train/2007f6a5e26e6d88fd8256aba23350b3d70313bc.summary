-- with the @entity2 military having effectively taken control of @entity4 , a permanent division of @entity6 is becoming increasingly likely			1
@entity2 president @entity8 's request to the @entity9 to approve military intervention in @entity6 in order to " protect citizens of @entity2 " highlights how once seemingly innocuous " compatriot policies " are being used by @entity13 to justify military efforts to regain @entity4 for @entity2			1
@entity2 's compatriot policies are officially meant to protect ethnic @entity2 living in nearby countries , but have served @entity2 's territorial expansionism in the past			1
in fact these compatriot policies can be viewed as part of @entity8 's new military doctrine that seeks territorial gains in the former @entity26 republics , particularly where there is a receptive population of @entity2 speakers			1
the compatriot policies , outlined in @entity2 's " @entity31 to 2020 , " were introduced in 2000 during @entity8 's first presidential term			1
they call for the political , economic and , potentially , military protection of the rights and interests of @entity2 citizens and ethnic @entity2 living abroad			2
an effective tactic associated with the policies is to give @entity2 citizenship to ethnic @entity2 in foreign states so as to better protect their interests			2
tellingly , @entity2 's national security strategy emphasizes that compatriots are an important tool for achieving @entity2 's foreign policy aims			1
map : a divided @entity6 looking at @entity2 's neighborhood , one can already see how compatriot policy has assisted @entity2 's foreign policy and territorial expansion			1
prior to the @entity52 - @entity2 war in 2008 , @entity52 was seeking closer relations with the @entity55 and distancing itself from @entity2 ( in a very similar vein to @entity6 today )			0
meanwhile @entity13 was handing out citizenship to the inhabitants of the separatist @entity52 territories of @entity62 and @entity63			0
thus the " protection of @entity2 citizens " became one of @entity2 's main motives for going to war with @entity52 in 2008 and securing @entity62 and @entity63 as @entity2 protectorates			2
but @entity6 does not have to look to the @entity70 to see compatriot policy in action			2
on @entity6 's southwestern border , @entity73 is a separatist territory of @entity75 which has also become effectively a @entity2 military - controlled territory as the @entity78 sought to " protect " the @entity2 speakers and eventually @entity2 citizens			1
opinion : the two @entity81 farther afield , @entity2 has also taken great pains to cultivate the loyalty of its compatriots in the @entity85 , particularly in @entity86 and @entity87			0
well aware of @entity2 's compatriot tactics , @entity89 , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the @entity91 , called an urgent meeting and also invoked the @entity94 treaty on @entity6			2
for @entity13 , @entity4 is much more important than @entity62 , @entity63 or @entity73			0
first , @entity4 became @entity96 territory only in 1954 when the @entity26 's leader @entity97 gave it to @entity98 under the overall authority of the @entity26			2
its loss after the disintegration of the @entity26 was a major blow to leaders in @entity13			0
second , @entity104 , one of @entity4 's major cities , serves as the naval base for @entity2 's @entity107			1
it is a prized territory that allows the @entity2 navy direct access to the @entity110			0
@entity4 is a particularly soft target for @entity2 's compatriot policies			1
unlike @entity6 , where people speak @entity96 , or even @entity114 , which is @entity2 speaking , @entity4 is predominantly ethnically @entity2			0
opinion : @entity8 's @entity118 endgame with @entity4 's @entity2 protesting the turn of events in @entity98 's @entity122 and expressing their solidarity with @entity13 , a secessionist movement is almost inevitable			1
already , the @entity4 parliament announced that it would hold a referendum to increase the peninsula 's autonomy from @entity6 and installed a @entity129 prime minister			0
while @entity4 's fate seems almost certain to follow those of @entity62 , @entity63 or @entity73 , other states near @entity2 that also have significant populations of @entity2 speakers should be vigilant			1
@entity8 's compatriot doctrine is here to stay			0
thus it is no wonder @entity52 will likely be urgently seeking integration with @entity94 and the @entity139			0
@entity6 should stabilize its government and consider following suit			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			0

@entity144 : @entity8 has made effective use of his " compatriot " policy
it enables @entity2 to gain territory in areas where ethnic @entity2 and @entity2 speakers live
she says @entity4 is a place where @entity2 can claim it was acting for " compatriots "
@entity144 : other nations in @entity2 's neighborhood should pay attention
