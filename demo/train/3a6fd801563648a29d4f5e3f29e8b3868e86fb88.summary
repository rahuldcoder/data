@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is 58 years old			1
he could be 78 , his beard gray , body frail and his face a leathery road map that traces the unimaginable horrors his family has endured			2
it is a face that reflects a visceral human portrait of the grinding violence in @entity1 and the toll it has taken on ordinary civilians			0
the @entity15 family are not politicians , nor insurgents , nor religious radicals			2
they are -- or used to be -- a family of humble watermelon sellers , plying their trade with plump fruit from @entity25 in their stall , barely 50 meters from their home in @entity0			1
their descent into hell began on july 23 , 2007			1
their son @entity3 -- 19 and a week away from his wedding -- was working on the family stall when one of @entity0 's ubiquitous car bombs targeted the market area			1
" i was a week away from marrying him off , " @entity3 sobs			1
" instead i buried him			2
" @entity3 does n't stop crying the entire time we are with the family			1
eight thousand @entity1 died last year , according to the @entity44 lists 640 civilian deaths so far in january			2
but numbers are anonymous and cold : to visit the @entity15 family is to see and feel and be suffocated by the human reality of those statistics			2
as the politicians play politics , and the insurgents deal in death , it is people like this who suffer the fallout , as they always do in war			0
@entity3 's devastated fiance @entity59 later married @entity3 's brother @entity60			1
together they had three children : a son , also called @entity3 , now aged three , and daughters @entity65 , four , and @entity66 , eight months			1
in july last year the family was preparing for their annual pilgrimage to the holy city of @entity71 , where @entity3 is buried , to honor his memory			1
it was july 20 , a saturday , and @entity60 and brother @entity74 were on duty at the water melon stand			2
everyone heard the bomb inside the family home			1
it rocked the walls and shook the ground			0
@entity60 , 23 , and @entity74 , 17 , were blown to pieces , along with several other people			2
today , the walls by the old watermelon stand are scarred by shrapnel			0
@entity3 has now lost all three sons			1
" no one will call me dad anymore , " he wails			0
the funeral was well attended : hundreds of neighbors and friends turned out , disbelieving what had happened to this family			2
chanting and wailing mourners carried the coffins aloft to begin @entity60 and @entity74 's journey to @entity71 to lie alongside @entity3			1
the children asked daily where their father was			0
@entity3 and his wife , @entity101 , at first could n't face telling them the truth , instead saying he 'd gone to @entity25 for more watermelons			1
eventually , of course , they had to explain that he , and their uncle , were dead			0
" we tell them he has gone to paradise and is watching over them , but @entity3 especially can not comprehend , " says @entity3			1
" when we say his father is in paradise , he just cries			0
" @entity3 is clearly a traumatized boy			1
his sister seems happy enough , playing on a sofa with her cousin and a tattered doll			0
@entity60 's other child , the baby daughter @entity66 , was just a few weeks old when her father died			2
she smiles at me and touches my watch , enthralled by the shiny wristband and oblivious to her forlorn circumstances			0
then @entity65 surprises us by suddenly counting to 10 in @entity127			0
we applaud her and her face lights up with pride			0
she counts again , and then once more			0
the smiles her performance brings are a rare event in this home			0
@entity3 sits nearby , his head dipping and swaying , as it 's done ever since his father died			1
the family has a fourth son , @entity137 , but after the second explosion he fell apart emotionally and was certain that one day he too would die			1
and then he vanished , simply disappeared			0
the family has n't seen or heard from him since			1
@entity60 's widow , @entity59 , still lives with the family , or what remains of it			1
she hides in the kitchen during our visit , unwilling to speak about what the two car bombs took from her			0
@entity3 continues to weep and lament the family 's bleak future			1
the watermelon stand was the family 's only income			1
they are seven months behind on the rent for their tiny three - room house on a muddy side street			0
six people are crammed into the home , @entity3 and @entity101 , and @entity60 's widow and three children			1
" it 's like we are living in a dark place , " says the grieving mother , @entity101			0
" what does one do when you lose your children ? we do n't go out , we keep our door closed			0
we want to leave and not stay in this country , but we ca n't afford it			0
" " they were our bread winners , " says @entity3			1
" they supported us , now i have no income , i have to now sell belongings			0
i have n't paid the rent for seven months			0
i think of committing suicide , but what would happen to the children ? if an official loses a son , all the media covers it and the family is looked after			1
i have lost three sons and the fourth fled and no one cares about us			2
" we leave @entity3 and @entity101 and the grandchildren they now raise and they thank us for telling their story to the world			2
we have no words , nothing that could possibly comfort or offer promise			0
just gratitude for their courage in trying to get others outside this place to maybe understand the human cost of what goes on here			0
tomorrow , or the next day , there are sure to be more bombs or bullets sending more families down the tortuous road being navigated by @entity3			2
