the long investigation surrounding a mysterious battery fire that made so much trouble for @entity4 's @entity3 is closed			1
the @entity7 report -- released december 1 -- comes nearly two years after burning and smoking batteries grounded all 50 of the world 's most advanced airliners flying at the time			1
when you pick apart the 110 - page document , it reveals how any new piece of equipment can pose dangerous problems , even a noncritical piece of equipment like batteries			2
in this situation , the battery created one of the worst threats possible : an onboard fire			2
from a broader perspective , the investigation reminds us of the heavy responsibilities shared by the world 's aviation regulators and aircraft makers			0
the battery problems struck @entity4 shortly after it had rolled out what was then a new model aircraft , with some of the most sophisticated technology available			1
it all started in january 2013 , when an empty @entity38 787 caught fire while parked at @entity41 's @entity40			2
a second battery incident nine days later in @entity43 prompted the @entity44 to ground the entire @entity3 fleet while the problem was fixed			1
read more about the battery now , with more than @entity48 in service , the @entity44 says safer battery systems have been installed in the planes			2
the @entity7 basically blamed the battery problem on two things : -- overheating from an electrical short circuit that may have been caused by manufacturing defects -- allegedly unsatisfactory oversight of the manufacturing process by both the @entity44 and @entity4 read the full @entity7 report ( @entity59 ) on the battery fire to bring the investigation into sharper focus , here are eight questions and answers associated with the report : 1			1
what was the root cause of the short circuit ? it 's remarkable : the investigation was unable to pinpoint the root cause of the battery cell short - circuit			1
neither could @entity43 investigators , although they had a theory			0
how closely does the @entity44 monitor the development of aviation technology ? the @entity44 allows @entity4 and other qualified manufacturers to use their own employees to confirm that new aircraft components meet safety regulations			1
they follow specific @entity44 guidelines and submit to regular checks by @entity44 officials			2
experts say more and more of that self - checking oversight is moving further down the supply chain to subcontractors			2
@entity7 investigators recommended that both the @entity44 and @entity4 " develop or revise processes to establish more effective oversight " of suppliers			1
the report also called on the @entity3 's @entity43 - based battery maker , @entity95 , to " review its cell manufacturing processes and ensure its employees are properly trained			1
" @entity98 , a @entity99 - based attorney who represents the battery maker , said this week that " @entity95 had respectfully disagreed with a number of the observations @entity7 made regarding manufacturing defects			1
" he said the company is studying the report and is " eager to implement continuous quality improvements with the suggestions of the @entity7 , @entity44 " and @entity43 's aviation regulators			1
how did all this get started ? the battery , like those aboard all @entity48 , was a lithium - ion battery , a technology that airline manufacturers like as a way to save fuel costs because of its low weight			1
lithium - ion batteries also power cell phones and laptops			1
it 's a developing technology that has a history of overheating issues			0

passenger safety and billions of dollars in @entity4 aircraft orders were at risk			2
officials needed to know what went wrong			0
that 's why the @entity44 did something next that it had n't done in more than 30 years : it grounded an entire type of airliner , nationwide			0
for about four months @entity140 sat idle			0
to fix the problem , each battery was put inside a fireproof steel box to prevent the battery from catching fire			0
just in case , the box includes vents that would force any smoke outside the plane			0
more insulation against heat was also added , and the batteries were redesigned to charge at lower levels			0
in the 19 months since the @entity3 fix , there have been no reports of batteries catching fire , although a 787 battery cell did overheat while on the ground earlier this year			1
" the improvements made to the 787 battery system last year appear to have worked as designed , " @entity4 told @entity162 in a statement at the time			2
related : @entity166 blamed for @entity168 fire 4			0
could it happen again ? @entity4 and the battery maker say no. theoretically , if another @entity174 short - circuits and overheats , the system will remain safe because there wo n't be enough oxygen in the containment box for a fire to be possible , a @entity4 spokeswoman said			1
does that make the battery maker comfortable with the fact that the root cause of the short - circuit remains a mystery ? " @entity95 is very comfortable in knowing that the quality of the manufacturing processes and the redesign of the battery will prevent a situation from occurring as it did in the @entity41 and @entity43 incidents , " said @entity98			1
how important are these batteries , anyway ? they 're necessary , but they have backups in case they fail			0
the batteries are used only before take - off to power up the cockpit computer and to start the plane 's auxiliary power unit			0
( that 's the thing that fires up the @entity3 's two jet engines			0
) after takeoff -- unless there 's a power failure -- these batteries are not in use because electricity to run onboard equipment is generated by the engines			0
even if there is a power failure -- which is highly unlikely -- there are other ways pilots can create electrical power to run the 787 's steering and other systems			0
for example , small wind turbines -- called ram air turbines , or @entity222 -- that pop out of the aircraft to generate juice via wind power			0
will @entity4 and the @entity44 develop a more effective process to oversee suppliers ? @entity4 says it did that already , before the @entity7 report			1
the company said it now has a " more formal flow of requirements and increased interaction between @entity4 , its suppliers and sub-tier suppliers as compared to the processes in place earlier			0
" the @entity44 said it also has " effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after certification " of the 787			0
but it also said it 's still evaluating the @entity7 recommendations " and will provide a timely response to the board			0
do airliner manufactures plan to use lithium - ion batteries on new aircraft models ? they do			1
immediately after the @entity3 's troubles , @entity4 competitor @entity251 announced it was pulling lithium - ion batteries from early production models of its new @entity257 aircraft and going with traditional -- and heavier -- nickel cadmium batteries			1
but in september @entity251 did a 180			0
it said it planned to switch back to lithium - ion batteries on @entity260 set to be delivered in 2016			1
@entity251 ' chief designer told @entity262 the company can " mitigate any risks to zero			0
" @entity4 said this week it would decide whether to use lithium - ion batteries in new planes " on a case - by - case basis			1
were there any surprises in the report ? yes : a random , unrelated problem with a new type of cockpit voice recorder			0
the report revealed that a new recorder on the @entity276 did n't record voices very well , a situation that " could impede future aircraft investigations , " the @entity7 said			2
almost all crew conversations recorded by the cockpit voice recorder were " completely obscured " by ambient cockpit noise , according to the report			0
the @entity44 should require @entity4 to improve the quality of the audio on the recording device , the @entity7 said			1
@entity4 said it 's still examining the @entity7 recommendations			2
overall , for aviation enthusiasts and fans of the @entity3 , the report offered a mountain of insider data about the popular aircraft			2
as @entity98 , the @entity95 attorney , put it , " i think we can all rest assured that this is the most investigated battery incident , ever			0

investigation ends into 2013 lithium - ion battery fire on @entity3
@entity7 report blames short circuit and allegedly unsatisfactory @entity44 / @entity4 oversight
@entity44 , @entity4 and battery maker are *confident* the problems have been fixed
@entity4 and @entity251 considering using lithium - ion batteries on future airliners
