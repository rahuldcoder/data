@entity0 -- an education advocacy group has filed a lawsuit against @entity4 and state education officials challenging teacher - tenure laws , on the heels of a watershed case in which a @entity10 judge ruled that state 's tenure laws unconstitutional			1
the lawsuit filed thursday in @entity14 on behalf of 11 @entity4 public school students claims that tenure laws can prevent students from receiving a " sound basic education , " according to a statement from the @entity4 @entity20 , of which parents of the plaintiffs are members			1
" teachers in @entity4 are more likely to die on the job than be replaced because of poor performance , " the lawsuit said			0
the lawsuit is framed similarly to a case brought in @entity10 , in which a judge in june deemed teacher tenure unconstitutional , saying it kept bad teachers in the classroom and forced out promising good ones			1
that landmark ruling was hailed by the nation 's top education chief as opening opportunities across the nation to " build a new framework for the teaching profession			0
" the decision represented " a mandate " to fix a broken teaching system , @entity42 education secretary @entity41 said			0
in @entity0 , the lawsuit claims that under city law an educator who obtains tenure is shielded from dismissal , no matter how incompetent they are or how poorly their students perform			2
" the state requires a quality - blind approach to layoffs that considers only years of service -- and completely ignores job performance and the ability to deliver a sound quality education , " the lawsuit said			2
but the @entity60 union said tenure laws are " wildly misunderstood " and claimed teacher tenure does not ensure a job for life , as is commonly believed			1
" earning tenure in @entity0 simply means that , if a teacher is accused of incompetence or wrongdoing , she is entitled to a fair hearing before she can be fired , " @entity60 president @entity65 said in a statement last week			1
@entity1 was unable to reach the union for comment friday about the lawsuit			0
@entity75 called the process for removing teachers " due process of law			2
" the @entity20 , however , called the process rare			2
the lawsuit said only 12 teachers between 1997 and 2007 in the @entity4 school system were formally replaced because of poor performance			0
the @entity4 @entity85 has 75,000 teachers in any given year , working in the largest school system in the country			0
@entity89 and @entity90 -- the parents union 's president and vice president -- said in a statement that the legal action was not an attack on teachers or unions , but rather an attempt to give their children a voice and establish a system that " rewards and retains excellent teachers " while providing appropriate resources to struggling teachers			0
reforming teacher tenure and firing laws is a hotly debated issue in @entity42 education , with the @entity10 case widely seen as setting the stage for similar action nationally			1
reformers say tenure laws and union protections make firing a bad teacher almost impossible , but teachers and their unions argue that school boards and their firing criteria have unfair , overtly political standards			1
the @entity121 is the largest system of public schools in the @entity42 , serving about 1.1 million students in more than 1,700 schools .			0

@entity0 student plaintiffs claim teacher - tenure laws are *flawed*
@entity20 : tenure laws are " wildly misunderstood , " teachers are entitled to due process
in a similar @entity10 case , a judge threw out state teacher - tenure laws
