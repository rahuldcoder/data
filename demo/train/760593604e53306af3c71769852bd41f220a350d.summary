@entity0 , @entity1 -- only last week @entity1 police sources say officers investigating the @entity6 massacre were called to a meeting to explain why @entity8 , the so - called " @entity8 , " continues to elude them			1
the pressure is on , and they almost caught her two years ago in a series of raids in the coastal city of @entity14			2
she slipped through their fingers but left tantalizing clues to her life on the run on her lap top			2
it 's been cat and mouse since			0
@entity8 first hit notoriety in the @entity26 eight years ago when her husband and the father of two of her children blew himself up on a crowded @entity32 commuter tube train , killing 26 people early on july 7 , 2005			1
she claimed to be appalled by his suicide bombing but has since disappeared , her name resurfacing connected to the @entity37 - allied terror group @entity36			1
in june this year a @entity1 cabinet briefing paper delivered to officials named @entity8 as a suspect in a 2011 @entity1 terror plot sanctioned by @entity37 leaders in @entity43 targeting government buildings , @entity46 offices and top politicians			1
but she seems to keep one step ahead of the law			0
when security services arrived at the upmarket @entity52 apartments in the capital @entity0 two years ago she was gone			0
she had fled the $ 1,000 - a - month property in tears just a week earlier according to the building manager , who does not want to be identified by name			2
she was fleeing , no notice given , breaking the terms of her tenancy			0
as he was squaring it with the landlord as she was trying to drive away , she let rip at him , he says			2
" she opened the window and she says , ' this man i can kill you and people will forget you from today			0
' " when i asked @entity71 , @entity1 's inspector general of police , about @entity8 's seven - month stay in the affluent middle class neighborhood , he told me : " he was not aware " she had been there , adding " it 's all rumors			1
" @entity52 's manager would disagree			0
@entity8 and the man he believed to be her husband had him doing all sorts of odd jobs , from fixing water pipes to fetching groceries , he says			1
they were the sorts of odd jobs he used to do for all his tenants , but the woman he now knows as the " @entity8 " was anything but ordinary			1
the building manager told me she would change her phone number several times a day			1
" she can give me a number in the morning at 8			2
at 9 if i call her she has changed to another line ... at 10 or 11 another line , at 4 [ p.m. ] another line			2
" she did other things that were odd too			0
her apartment overlooked @entity101 mall , one of the city 's more upmarket destinations for shopping			0
@entity107 department store there sells everything from freezers to frozen peas , and is popular with expats and rich @entity1			1
he says she would spend a lot of time there just watching people			0
but it 's what her " husband , " whom he knew as @entity124 , did that now he says he finds chilling			0
he asked him to watch the mall and figure out if many @entity127 used it			0
" he is asking me : can you monitor the people who are coming in this @entity107 ? are they @entity127 ? can you tell me which people are coming there in number ? " junction mall is much like the @entity6 that was attacked by terrorist gunmen last month , leaving 67 people dead			1
the gunmen spared those who could show they were @entity127			0
and these days no corner of @entity1 is spared the speculation that @entity8 may have played a role in that attack			1
it never occurred to the building manager that @entity8 might be anything other than the employee of a @entity148 " intercom " company that she claimed to be			1
she had explained to the building manager that even though she was a @entity127 , her mother was @entity153 and that 's why she had given @entity153 names to her children			0
of course now he knows it 's all lies , her eldest son whom he knew as @entity162 was tough , he says , and ready to protect his mother			0
" this boy is bad			0
' i will kill you , ' he said			0
' i will kill you , ' he was tough - talking , like a big person "			2
what names @entity8 and her family go by today is anyone 's guess			1
at @entity52 she had signed the tenancy agreement using a fake @entity174 passport in the name of @entity176 , a @entity26 nurse from @entity177			1
police seized that passport in the raid in @entity14 that netted her computer a few months later			2
on the heels of the westgate mall attack @entity1 authorities asked @entity184 to help track her down , and they promptly issued a red notice demanding she be detained at any border she tries to cross			1
if she is still in @entity1 , and that certainly seems to be the working assumption of the police here , finding a place she can hide now will not be easy			1
a white woman with four children in tow , whose ages are all well documented , would seem easy to spot			0
but when i asked the harassed - sounding police inspector - general how the search for @entity8 was going , he hung the phone up on me			1
the answer , i inferred , is not well .			0

@entity26 - born terror suspect @entity8 , or " @entity8 , " has eluded @entity1 police
landlord of " @entity8 " says @entity8 " changed her phone number " several times a day
@entity8 was married to one of the bombers who attacked @entity32 in 2005
authorities say @entity8 became part of a terror cell linked to the @entity213 group @entity36
