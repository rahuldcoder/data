@entity0 -- it was somewhere in the middle of @entity6 ' @entity5 roller coaster that my eye started to short - circuit , nearly going black			1
the towering roller coaster pressed my fellow riders and me deep into our seats as we rounded a set of sharp curves			1
many find the ride thrilling ; for me it was unnerving			2
i spent much of my time in line for the next ride of the day , the @entity22 roller coaster , reading about the potential for roller coaster deaths and accidents			1
this was friday in @entity27 , the same day a woman died after falling from her seat on a @entity6 coaster in @entity31			1
pecking through roller coaster news on my phone that day , before the death in @entity31 had been reported , i learned , among other things , that it was reported that a 45 - year - old died after passing out and having an apparent heart attack on @entity5 , the ride that made my eye briefly malfunction			1
i get that this seems paranoid , and i knew reading this information while waiting in line for a roller coaster was an unnecessary form of self - torture			1
but i could n't help it			2
there 's something about a roller coaster death that is uniquely terrifying in a screenplay kind of way			1
it 's summer fun gone horribly wrong			2
i think this is partly why so many are shocked and saddened by the death of @entity59 , who fell , according to a witness who spoke with @entity1 affiliate @entity61 , from the @entity63 roller coaster at @entity6 in @entity64 , @entity31			1
the exact cause remains unknown , but authorities say there was no sign of " foul play or criminality			0
" six flags said in a statement that safety is paramount			0
" since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority , the ride has been closed pending further investigation , " the park said			0
a park spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on its safety inspection policies and the calls for federal oversight			2
still , it 's a reluctant thrill seeker 's greatest fear			0
it 's almost impossible to imagine how terrifying the experience would be -- and how family members and fellow riders could process such an accident			0
after @entity102 's death , sen. @entity96 , the @entity97 from @entity98 who recently took the seat vacated by @entity100 , has reportedly renewed his call for federal oversight of roller coaster inspection			1
" no federal agency has legal authority to enforce safety standards , " @entity106 wrote in a post about the safety issues			2
" and @entity31 is one of at least 17 states that have no agency responsible for inspecting amusement park rides , according to @entity117 ' survey of state codes in all 50 states			1
" @entity96 wants a federal agency to oversee safety enforcement			2
the @entity122 regulates mobile amusement park rides , like those found at fairs , but does not have jurisdiction over " fixed " rides like those at @entity6 , said @entity128 , a spokesman for the federal agency			1
the difference makes little sense , and @entity96 is n't alone in his call for more oversight			2
@entity134 , from the @entity135 at @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138 , said that relatively little is known about the prevalence of roller coaster injuries and deaths because the federal government does n't enforce safety inspections and investigations			1
a patchwork of state laws govern the process , she said			0
would - be roller coaster regulators have been criticized as needlessly scaring people about the dangers of roller coasters			1
and it 's true that the statistics are n't quite as terrifying as the rides			2
as the @entity158 put it this year , " @entity155 are 5,000 times more likely to be legally executed by their own government than to die on a roller coaster			1
" the writer , @entity160 , puts the odds of roller coaster death at 1 in 1.5 billion in a given year , compared with a 1 in 10 million chance of being killed " because the aircraft he is traveling on falls apart			1
" but that framing is misleading , given how little is known about national roller coaster injuries			1
one of the best sources of information comes from a @entity172 study of child injuries in the @entity155			0
after looking at injuries that were treated in hospitals from 1990 to 2010 , the group found that a child is hospitalized from an injury related to an amusement park , carnival , fair or arcade - type ride once every three days in the summer , @entity134 said			0
these are serious injuries : fractures , neck injuries and traumatic brain injuries			0
including less serious injuries like bruises and sprains , about 4,440 child injuries are reported to hospitals each year on the rides , including those at fairs and other attractions , she said			2
the rate is 20 injuries per day during the summer months			0
" we would really like to see a national database or a national system put in place so we can get a picture of what 's happening , " she said			0
the group was unable to compile info on deaths , for example			0
regardless of the stats , however , it 's the joy - gone - wrong factor that makes roller coaster deaths particularly horrifying			1
are those fears slightly irrational and disproportionate ? maybe			0
but safety seems far from assured these days			0
improvements , of course , must be weighed against deadlier public safety concerns			0
more should be done , for instance , to prevent road - traffic deaths , which kill about 1.3 million people globally each year			0
many of those deaths could be prevented with simple changes to traffic laws and other rules , according to a fascinating report from @entity225 ( @entity226 ) ; and self - driving cars could lead to greater reductions , still			0
but the existence of more - pressing and deadlier threats does not justify lax oversight of amusement park rides that are meant to entertain			2
roller coaster fans should support a review of safety requirements			1
otherwise , at the very least , they risk having a joyous experience soured by fear			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity240 .			0
