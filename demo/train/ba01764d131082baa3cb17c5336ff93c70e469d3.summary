@entity0 -- pope @entity3 has appointed a group of eight cardinals from around the world to look into ways of reforming the @entity8 , the @entity2 said saturday			1
the group , which includes @entity11 cardinal @entity10 from @entity12 , will examine ways to revise the @entity2 constitution , @entity15 , which sets the rules for running the @entity17 , or church hierarchy			1
the cardinals -- who come from @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 -- will first meet in october , the @entity2 said			1
the move follows on from suggestions made during the @entity27 , a series of meetings that brought together all the cardinals last month before they elected @entity3 as pope , the @entity2 said			1
the other seven cardinals are : @entity33 , president of the @entity35 governorate ; @entity36 from @entity37 ; @entity38 from @entity39 ; @entity40 from @entity41 ; @entity42 from the @entity43 ; @entity44 from @entity45 ; and @entity46 from @entity47			2
an @entity49 bishop , monsignor @entity48 , will act as secretary for the group			0
pope @entity3 has already been in touch with the chosen cardinals , the @entity2 said			1
the @entity8 has faced calls for reform in the wake of scandals involving the sexual abuse of children by priests and allegations of corruption			2
the rev. @entity63 , issuing guidance on behalf of the @entity2 , said the group of cardinals was just that -- " not a commission , committee or council			1
" it " has no legislative power and its main function is to ' advise ' the pope , " he said			0
" the group will not in any way interfere in the normal functions of the @entity17 , which helps the @entity3 in the daily governance of the @entity8			1
" the group 's formation , exactly a month after @entity3 was elected , shows that the pope " listens attentively " to what the cardinals say , @entity63 said			1
the document the cardinals are studying is the @entity83 of @entity84 , known as the @entity15 , which was published in 1988			0
@entity1 @entity2 analyst @entity86 , who 's also a correspondent for the @entity87 , wrote that the news was " a signal that major reform may be on the horizon			2
" " strikingly , there was only one member of the @entity17 among the eight cardinals tapped to assist the pope			2
the rest come from various parts of the world , with at least one representing each continent , " he said			0
the group will be coordinated by @entity101 , from @entity102 , who speaks several languages and was himself seen as possible contender for the papacy			0
in @entity47 , " @entity101 has long led the pack in terms of moral authority and social influence , " @entity86 wrote in a profile ahead of the papal election , or conclave			0
@entity1 's @entity114 reported from @entity0 and @entity115 wrote in @entity116			0
