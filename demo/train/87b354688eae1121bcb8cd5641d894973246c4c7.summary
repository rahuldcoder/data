-- the @entity1 is dialing up the pressure on @entity3 , saying monday it will cut off oil imports and freeze assets in an effort to starve the country 's nuclear program of funding			1
" today 's action demonstrates the @entity1 's growing concern about @entity3 's nuclear programme , and our determination to increase peaceful , legitimate pressure on @entity3 to return to negotiations , " @entity14 foreign secretary @entity13 said in a statement from @entity16 , @entity17			1
the sanctions freeze the assets of @entity3 's central bank in @entity1 nations and ban the importation of @entity3 oil to those countries			1
the measures also block @entity1 countries from exporting petrochemical equipment and technology to @entity3 , or trading diamonds and precious metals with the @entity36 state			2
the sanctions are necessary because @entity3 continues to defy @entity39 resolutions regarding its nuclear program , @entity13 said			1
" @entity3 has it in its power to end sanctions by changing course and addressing the concerns of the international community , " he said			2
@entity48 prince : why @entity3 wo n't close @entity49 @entity51 officials welcomed the sanctions , with treasury secretary @entity53 and secretary of state @entity54 saying in a joint statement monday that the new measures will " sharpen the choice for @entity3 's leaders			1
" but @entity3 's deputy foreign minister , @entity59 , said the measures will only harm the fragile economies of the @entity1 , according to the official @entity61			1
" sanctions have proved ineffective in the past and will prove futile in the future , too , " @entity61 quoted @entity59 as saying			0
the @entity51 government took its own punitive action regarding @entity3 on monday , with the @entity67 targeting the nation 's third - largest bank , the state - owned @entity68 , for allegedly working with other @entity3 banks and firms subject to sanctions tied to @entity3 's nuclear program			1

@entity83 , the @entity67 undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence , called @entity68 -- which has nearly 2,000 branches in @entity3 , plus branches in @entity88 and @entity89 -- " one of @entity3 's few remaining access points to the international financial system			1
" today 's sanction against @entity68 will deepen @entity3 's financial isolation , make its access to hard currency even more tenuous , and further impair @entity3 's ability to finance its illicit nuclear program , " said @entity83			1
the @entity99 said shortly after the fresh oil sanctions were announced that officials from the @entity39 nuclear watchdog agency will visit @entity3 january 29 to 31 " to resolve all outstanding substantive issues			1

@entity48 oil minister @entity140 told @entity0 last week that his country could make up the difference if @entity3 was banned from exporting oil			2
@entity140 said the country has a spare capacity " to respond to emergencies worldwide , to respond to our customer demand , and that is really the focus			0
our focus is not on who drops out from production , but who wants more			0
" @entity155 has threatened to close the @entity49 , the only outlet to and from the @entity157 , as it faces possible sanctions			0
the @entity51 has made clear it will not let that happen			0
@entity3 : stuck between @entity51 and a hard place seventeen million barrels of oil per day passed through the critical shipping lane in 2011 , according to the @entity133			2
the @entity3 government gets about half its revenue from oil exports , according to the agency			2
analysts have said that while the new sanctions are the toughest ever imposed , they still contain many loopholes			0
@entity3 is expected to still be able to sell its oil to places like @entity173 , @entity174 or other @entity176 countries , but perhaps at a discount of 10 % to 15 %			0
about 35 % of @entity3 's oil exports currently go to @entity173 and @entity174			1
@entity180 leaders have been walking a fine line with @entity3 , working to come up with a plan that squeezes the country 's finances yet does n't result in a loss of @entity3 oil exports , which could send crude and gasoline prices skyrocketing			1
the @entity51 and @entity14 have already put new measures in place against @entity3 , and @entity191 has been pressing allies , including @entity193 and @entity194 , to stop buying @entity3 oil			1
@entity51 carrier defies @entity49 threat on friday , @entity1 foreign policy chief @entity198 challenged @entity3 to respond to an offer she made in a letter last october			1

her office released the letter on friday			0
@entity201 's spokesperson pointedly noted , " we are waiting for the @entity3 reaction			0
" @entity201 wrote that the @entity211 wants to " engage in a confidence - building exercise " that would lead to a " constructive dialogue " and a " step by step approach " in which @entity3 would assure the international community that its nuclear program is peaceful			1
@entity216 told reporters in @entity191 that " we stand by that letter			0
" " they have to give up their nuclear weapons program ... and they have to be willing to come to the table with a plan to do that , " she said			0
@entity216 made the comments friday after a meeting at the @entity228 with @entity230 foreign minister @entity229			2
the @entity230 minister was blunt in his assessment of @entity3 's actions : " @entity155 keeps violating its international obligations on the transparency of its nuclear program			1
we have no choice but to pass tough new sanctions that address the financial sources of the nuclear program			2
" @entity3 says its nuclear program is not military , but the @entity51 and many of its allies suspect @entity3 intends to produce a bomb			1
the @entity99 has expressed similar concerns			0
" one thing is clear , " @entity229 added			0
" the door for serious dialogue remains open , but the option of nuclear weapons in @entity3 is not acceptable to both of us			0
