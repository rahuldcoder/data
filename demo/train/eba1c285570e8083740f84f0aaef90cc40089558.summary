is it an extreme case of helicopter parenting or a smart move to keep kids safe ? that 's what parents are asking after hearing about a @entity10 middle school 's decision to ban most balls during recess and also require supervision of tag , even cartwheels , due to safety concerns			1
no longer allowed at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 : footballs , baseballs , soccer balls , lacrosse balls and any other hardballs that could injure a child			2
also off limits : rough games of tag and cartwheels unless an adult supervisor is on hand			1
" we want to make sure our children have fun but are also protected , " @entity31 , superintendent of @entity32 , said in a local television interview , noting how playground injuries can " unintentionally " become very serious			1
whatever happened to ' go outside and play ? ' the school district , in a press release , said that due to construction going on at the school , there is " limited space " for the children to play during their 20 - minute recess period			1
" with children in close proximity to each other , it is not safe for them to be engaged in unstructured play with hardballs , " said the district			2
it 's not clear when the construction project will come to an end at the school and if kids will be able to resume normal ball - playing after it wraps up			2
a call to the superintendent 's office for confirmation has not yet been returned			0
soft nerf balls will be provided during recess , and kids can play with hardballs during gym and intramural athletics			1
not suprisingly , when we asked what people thought about this school 's policy on @entity75 's @entity74 page , we got a ton of comments , the majority outraged by the school 's decision			2
" there are rational precautions ( helmets for bikers ) and then there is ridiculous			0
this is over the top , " said @entity86 on @entity74			0
ways to help your children stay in the game injury - free " this is n't smart			0
it 's actually counter-productive , " said @entity94 in an e-mail to @entity75			0
" it saddens me to think that children no longer experience the joy of kickball , tag , dodgeball and simple outdoor games i remember so fondly when i reflect on my childhood			1
our kids do n't experience physical activity unless it involves downloading an app. " " without opportunities to learn how to navigate space with their bodies , and to negotiate rules , risks , and experimentation of cooperative play , how are children going to ever be able to handle themselves in any society as adults ? " said @entity109 , an associate director at a @entity111 nursery school			0
on the other side , there were some people who thought the school 's actions were warranted			1
" freedom is great until the parents sue the school district , " said @entity127 on @entity74			1
" i do n't think kids should have their fun pasttimes discontinued , but head trauma can be serious , " said @entity131 on @entity74			1
" helmets can lessen that			0
even pro sports issues protection			0
they are now much more enlightened about wearing helmets while skateboarding and riding a bike , as well			0
" what do you think -- wise move or going too far ? tell us in the comments below .			0
