@entity0 , @entity1 -- at first the @entity1 doctors thought they were dealing with an outbreak of food poisoning			1
the patients that arrived for treatment in mid-june at hospitals in @entity0 had all gone to the same birthday party held at a house in the hilly countryside on the perimeter of the eastern @entity1 city			1
the sick had eaten shrimp at the party and doctors thought that meal might be the cause for the patients ' heavy vomiting and diarrhea			1
then more people began walking into hospitals with similar symptoms			0
but they had not attended the party			0
" they started coming in a few at a time , " said @entity28 , the director of the @entity29 , the largest in the region			0
" the first day five came , and then eight			0
that 's not normal , that five people would come with the same symptoms			1
the most critical days were when there were 30 to 32 patients who arrived in a single day			1
" a sudden spike in cases of diarrhea is not unusual for @entity0 's hospitals that treat the surrounding rural communities			1
there residents often live without indoor plumbing and in the summer months endure the scorching heat and heavy rains			0
illness kills three in eastern @entity1 this summer had already been particularly hot with heavy rains that caused outhouses to flood into several drinking wells			1
still , doctors suspected they were dealing with something they had n't seen before			0
" we became alarmed with the number of cases arriving			1
we usually see one or two cases of diarrhea each day , " said dr. @entity56 , who oversees a clinic on the edge of the city that attends to rural residents			1
the symptoms some patients exhibited -- the rapid onset of watery diarrhea and dehydration â € ” had also not been seen in generations			2
" the way that the outbreak developed and the appearance of other similar cases in the region , we realized this was a problem of a different magnitude , " said dr. @entity69 ± a , @entity1 's national director of epidemiology			1
the " problem " was cholera			2
@entity1 's last cholera outbreak occurred over a century ago			1
although eradicated in many countries , the disease , according to the @entity86 , still infects between 3 million and 5 million people each year , killing between 100,000 and 120,000			0
in @entity0 the outbreak has taken on a name of its own			2
there it 's simply referred to by residents as " el evento			2
" so far " @entity97 " has taken three lives and infected at least 110 people , said @entity98			0
he said doctors were waiting on test results for tens of other possible cases but said so far fewer than 30 % percent of suspected cases had been shown to be cholera			1
how cholera began in @entity105 he denied reports that the @entity1 government has underreported the death toll or that the outbreak is spreading to other provinces			1
he said a handful of suspected cases had been identified elsewhere in the country			2
but he said those cases had come from the same region where the original outbreak took place and are believed to have been infected there			1
" we can categorically say that there is no other outbreak in any other province , " @entity98 told @entity2 , outside the entrance to the @entity29 , where three more people had arrived suffering from severe diarrhea			2
@entity1 health officials allowed a @entity2 crew to be the first media to film in the hospital and speak with doctors there about the ongoing effort to control the cholera outbreak			1
to combat the outbreak , the local government has closed 12 contaminated wells around @entity0 , @entity98 said			2
clean water is being trucked in for residents until a different source of water can be found			0
at the entrances to hospitals and government buildings in the city stand buckets for people to wash their hands and soles of their shoes with chlorine bleach			0
cholera kills nearly 500 in @entity150 kiosks throughout @entity0 that sell milkshakes , iced drinks or other foods that come into contact with water have been shuttered			2
a temporary ban has also been issued for fishing and bathing in waters off the coast that may be contaminated			0
while in the rest of the country little has been said in the official press about the cholera , in @entity170 province , the site of the outbreak , residents are now shown a nightly program on how to prevent infection			1
@entity98 told @entity2 those efforts appear to be working and that doctors are seeing a decline in the rate of infection			0
the perception that the outbreak was increasing , he said , came from the seven to 10 days it takes for @entity1 's labs to return results of tests on the infected			1
" the number of cases is dropping , " he said			2
" that does n't make us confident so much as make us work to intensify all our preventive measures so that in the next few weeks we can stop the outbreak			0
" @entity190 has seen up close what cholera can do			0
the @entity0 schoolteacher was hospitalized for a week with cholera and only recently was allowed return home to finish her recovery			0
she winced as she recounted the agony that the infection caused her			0
" you 're very nervous because we had never seen this before here , " @entity190 said			0
" you 're feeling bad with diarrhea , vomiting and you lose weight very quickly			0
" lessons from deadly cholera outbreak			1
