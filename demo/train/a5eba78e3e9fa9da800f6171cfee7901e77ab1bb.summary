@entity0 -- it is a lesson from the ages : lawmakers like to talk			0
even in this advanced age when thoughtlets , capped at 140 characters , are tweeted as discourse , politicians still tend to prattle on			0
so here 's a cue from @entity12 : cut it short			1
when @entity12 took the stage , 150 years ago november 19 , to offer a dedication at a cemetery for war dead in @entity19 , @entity20 , the story goes that he was n't very popular			1
he did n't even have top billing at the event			1
@entity12 had been asked to " please offer a few appropriate remarks			1
" he settled on about 200 words			0
@entity26 's no - show at @entity19 event : snub or smart ? the keynote address was given by @entity31 , the @entity29 statesman hailed at the time as one of the nation 's greatest orators			1
ever hear of him today ? @entity31 spoke for more than two hours			1
@entity12 spoke for a little more than two minutes			1
" the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , " @entity12 said , ironically ; the @entity36 is now regarded as one of the most elegant , thoughtful and well - crafted speeches in @entity40 history			1
the words are etched in stone next to his statue at the @entity49			0
150 years later , newspaper retracts editorial panning @entity36 that 's a strong case for brevity			0
and it 's a case @entity12 seems to have learned during the course of his very difficult presidency			1
his first inaugural address , at 3,670 words , was delivered as he tried to keep the nation together			0
it was far longer than either of president @entity26 's			1
but @entity12 's second inaugural address , at 700 words , delivered after years of war , is considered by many to be the best inaugural speech in @entity40 history , and is also one of the shortest			1
it included one of the most important one - liners in history , with the @entity73 beaten but not yet surrendered , and as the nation started a very long and difficult healing process			0
" with malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as @entity81 gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations			0
" the shortest inaugural address in history was delivered by @entity97 as he entered his second term			0
this one perhaps goes too far			0
it was just 135 words and did n't include any talk of policy , just a promise to adhere to the oath of office			2
but the longest is a cautionary tale against over-speechifying			0
@entity107 spoke 8,460 words , caught pneumonia and died a month later			2
fast - forward 150 years from @entity12 's 200 words in @entity19			1
when @entity26 took to the podium in the @entity115 briefing room thursday and took a question from @entity118 ' @entity117 -- granted , it was a two - parter -- he went on for a full six minutes before @entity117 asked a follow - up			1
the news conference went on for about 50 minutes			1
love the president or hate him , you 've got to admit he can talk			0
it is hard to imagine a modern - day speech gaining the historical importance of something like the @entity36			2
@entity127 is a @entity12 scholar who has paid particular attention to @entity12 's speeches			1
he 's author of " @entity130 , " a biography of the 16th president			0
@entity12 's great short speeches , he argued , were different from modern - day addresses in a number of ways , not the least of which is the teleprompter			1
" speeches are meant to be said , not read , " @entity127 said			2
he feels @entity26 does better when he engages with an audience , speaking from the heart like when he 's campaigning rather than reading from a teleprompter			1
" when he does that , i do n't think he 's nearly as effective as when he does n't , " @entity127 said of @entity26			1
" he 's more engaged			0
" presidents ' best phrases are tweetable he said @entity12 wrote the @entity36 and had it memorized , although he took text out of his breast pocket before delivering it			1
another problem today , according to @entity127 : speechwriters			0
" it 's almost like a committee where everyone involved in the writing process wants to get their points in			2
" speeches today also feel too crowded , he said			2
" in the second inaugural , everybody expected @entity12 to talk about the policy of the government ... he did n't offer any policies			1
he gave a speech that offered the moral imperative			0
the policy would follow later			0
" we know @entity26 takes great care in editing the speeches drafted by his speechwriters			1
there is a remarkable photo of all the revisions in his own hand on one sheet of a 2010 address to a joint session of @entity178			0
see it here the @entity180 has posted drafts of the speech , written in @entity12 's hand , on its website			2
see it here @entity127 wishes today that speeches were printed in the newspaper so that people could actually read them and get at what the lawmaker is saying			2
after he watches a speech on tv , he said , the first thing he does is turn off the tv			0
" we do n't read speeches anymore , " complained @entity127 , who is of the mind that instant analysis on tv keeps people from really digesting what was said			2
but the largest problem for lawmakers giving speeches is n't a shortening collective attention span or political pundits or teleprompters			2
it 's the lack of trust in politicians and the institutions of government			0
" we 're cynical , " @entity127 said			0
" we 're cynical about speeches and about words			0
" @entity212 : learn @entity12 's words by heart			2

@entity12 did n't even get top billing at @entity217 *honoring* @entity218 dead
keynoter @entity31 spoke for two hours at @entity19 , @entity12 for about two minutes
@entity26 answered a question at a thursday news conference for six full minutes
modern speeches done by committee show how all writers want to get their points across
