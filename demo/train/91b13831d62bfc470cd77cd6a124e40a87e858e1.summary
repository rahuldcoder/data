-- if you really want to strike a blow for the environment during @entity4 on tuesday , do yourself and everybody else a favor and stop driving your car in town			1
really -- who needs it ? this is not a message for you if you 're a farmer or live in a rural area , where it 's 20 miles to the grocery store and 100 miles to the nearest hospital			2
you can keep your car ; it 's a safety thing			2
but for the rest of you -- those of you living , working and going to school in @entity22 's cities and big towns -- it 's time to work toward something better			1
this year 's @entity4 theme is green cities , and green cities should have no cars			1
what does driving get you anyway ? expense : want to give yourself a 17 % raise ? stop driving			2
the average @entity22 spends more money on transportation than food each year			1
they spend twice as much money on transportation as on health care			1
gas ai n't cheap , nor are tires , tolls , taxes , insurance , car payments , speeding tickets and parking to keep your car			0
traffic : you 're late to work , in a foul mood , tired of staring at someone else 's bumper			2
this is the modern @entity22 condition in and around cities			1
and it 's getting worse every year			2
in 1982 , the average @entity22 spent 16 hours each year stalled in traffic ; in 2011 traffic contributed an average of 38 hours of misery per year , costing the nation an estimated $ 120 billion in lost time and wasted fuel			1
the grumble of a river of motorcars pouring down the boulevard			0
excessive environmental noise is linked to insomnia , stress and deafness			0
can you hear me ? an estimated 104 million @entity22 per year are exposed to harmful clamor , most of it derived from traffic			1
no parking : studies show that on average 30 % of the traffic in cities is the result of people just cruising to find parking			2
what is a car without a place to park ? a two - ton albatross around the neck			0
@entity93 death : cars are killers -- of pedestrians , cyclists and other drivers			2
in @entity22 , the lifetime odds of dying by car are 1 in 112 ; only cancer , heart and respiratory diseases , and suicide kill more @entity22			1
slow death : cars also contribute to cancer and heart and respiratory diseases by spewing pollution , adding heat to the summer - hot city and preventing exercise			2
you 'd feel better and be more productive if you walked or biked your way to work , at least during the nice weather			0
wasted time : on the whole , cars are a lousy way to get people around			1
a busy city street can move about 4,400 people in cars in an hour			0
the same street could move 52,000 ( ! ) people by bus , streetcar or subway in the same time and use less energy in the process			0
opinion : as nuclear power dies , solar rises and i have n't even mentioned the global effects of getting cars out of cities , among them : reducing carbon pollution would slow climate change and habitat destruction			1
so how would this work ? it would require vision , leadership and collective will			0
just imagine how a green city might work without cars			1
if folks were n't spending their paychecks on the beast , then they might be more willing to support the construction of frequent , clean , attractive , more extensive and cheaper public transportation , a boon for all , especially the elderly and disabled			0
people might also ride their bikes , or even walk , to work , once the places formerly used to house cars ( that is , parking lots and garages ) have been replaced with green housing , parks and open spaces for people			1
streetcars , buses and light rail could move people around above ground			1
subways could be retrofitted to transport freight rather than people by night			0
smaller deliveries can go by bike or clean - fuel , golf - cart - like vehicles			0
how about emergencies ? fire engines , ambulances and other emergency vehicles could still use city streets and would get there all the sooner for having less traffic to wade through			0
and what about weekends in the country ? no problem			0
take the trolley up to a city line garage , claim your car and away you go			0
just park it there again when you get back .			0

@entity195 : @entity4 's theme is green cities . how to get there ? get cars out of town
he says @entity22 would save substantial money and time by not driving in cities
he says cars pollute and harm the health of *humans* and the environment
@entity195 : biking , walking and light rail would *obviate* need for cars
