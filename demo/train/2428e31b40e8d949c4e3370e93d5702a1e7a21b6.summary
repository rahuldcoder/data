@entity0 -- @entity2 was raised in a tight - knit world of @entity5 families in a community that protected its own			1
there were three boys in one room , six girls in another			2
as he grew up , authorities say , it was n't long before he became one of @entity0 's most notorious gangsters			2
he learned to fight and survive on the mean streets of @entity0 -- " @entity0 " to residents -- and to local kids who wanted to emulate him , he was iconic			2
" the guy was legendary , " said @entity20 , a former drug runner for @entity2 who served 12 years in prison for cocaine trafficking			1
" he was legendary of being the guy that controlled everything that ever happened in @entity0 and for the @entity27			2
he made tough guys shake			2
" but for the past 15 years , authorities said the man feared across @entity0 lived a quiet , reclusive life in a small @entity33 apartment			2
before his arrest in june , @entity2 and longtime girlfriend @entity34 passed themselves off as " @entity37 and @entity38 " to their neighbors in the @entity42 suburb of @entity43			1
during that time , the fugitive @entity2 became " the @entity44 of gangsters , " as one former @entity47 official put it , even as his escape from a pending indictment led to a scandal that tarnished the bureau			1
@entity2 's life on the lam @entity2 has pleaded not guilty to 19 counts of murder , while @entity57 is charged with harboring a fugitive			1
by the time the two met , @entity2 had served 10 years for bank robbery in federal prisons -- first in @entity61 , then @entity62			1
after getting out , he vowed he would never go back to jail			0
when @entity66 reporters @entity67 and @entity68 began their groundbreaking reporting on @entity2 in the 1980s , they discovered a single , compelling fact			1
" he had n't gotten so much as a parking ticket since he was released , " @entity67 said			0
@entity2 's lack of a record after 1965 was all the more startling , since @entity67 and @entity68 found he was being investigated by @entity0 police and the @entity75 after a series of killings he was suspected of carrying out himself or ordering others to commit			1
there was a reason @entity2 was able to remain untouched : he was a confidential informant for the @entity47 , a federal judge later concluded in a 600 - plus - page report in 1999			1
more than that , the agent closest to @entity2 , @entity85 , routinely informed @entity2 about ongoing investigations , federal documents later showed			1
@entity67 said @entity85 " did everything , including breaking all kinds of laws over the years to keep that alive			1
" beyond the @entity2 lore : ten victims @entity85 , now serving a 40 - year prison term , did @entity2 one final favor in the mid- 1990s			1
he told him of pending indictments for drug and racketeering charges brought by agencies outside the @entity47 , and @entity2 fled			1
he was on the @entity47 's @entity100 for more than 15 years , second only to @entity102 leader @entity101 as the bureau 's priority			1
former @entity47 agent @entity105 , now a @entity1 consultant , says the bureau received more than 12,000 tips over the years about @entity2 and where he might have been seen			1
in one case , @entity105 said , agents received a tip that @entity2 would be on flight to an unknown city in @entity115			1
" there were thousands of police officers involved in that round - the - clock operation , " @entity105 said " everyone went full bore to follow up on those leads and try to find him			0
in a way , he became the @entity44 of gangsters			0
" but all along , it seems , @entity2 and @entity57 were in @entity43 , in a small apartment four blocks from the @entity128 beaches , according to their building manager			1
@entity2 's ' relatively comfortable ' lifestyle one neighbor , 88 - year - old @entity132 , told @entity1 she saw the couple she knew as the @entity134 regularly			2
they were friendly , she says , but cautious about giving away too much information			0
" we were good neighbors , and we met mostly in the lobby picking up the mail , " @entity132 said			0
in one encounter , " i said , ' i do n't see your husband coming and going with you			0
' ' no , ' she said , ' he has depression			0
he does n't sleep at night and starts sleeping at five in the morning			0
' and then it seemed he was better			0
" on one occasion , she asked the couple to be a point of contact in the case of emergency			0
the couple did not have a car , paid for everything in cash and had a phone number that went directly to an answering service , @entity132 said			0
" i asked her , ' can you give me your phone so i can call you ? ' so she gave me a number , but that number goes to an answering service , " she said			0
" they take the message and they relay it to mr. @entity170			0
and if they wanted , they would answer			0
if they did n't , you would n't get an answer			0
" ultimately , the @entity47 began airing a public service announcement with an emphasis on @entity57			2
less than two days later , a tip generated because of that television campaign led to the couple 's arrest in @entity43			0
how they caught him inside , prosecutors said they found more than $ 800,000 in cash and 30 weapons , including handguns , an automatic rifle and a hand grenade .			0
