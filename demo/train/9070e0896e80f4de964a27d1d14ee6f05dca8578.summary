@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 said sunday that the @entity3 was considering a federal lawsuit against @entity6 's new immigration law			1
" we are considering all of our options			0
one possibility is filing a lawsuit , " @entity2 told @entity12 's " meet the press			2
" possible grounds for the lawsuit would be whether the @entity6 law could lead to civil rights violations , he said			1
the recently enacted @entity6 law initially allowed police to ask anyone for proof of legal @entity22 residency , based solely on a police officer 's suspicion that the person might be in the country illegally			1
@entity6 lawmakers soon amended the law so that officers could check a person 's status only if the person had been stopped or arrested for another reason			0
critics say the law will lead to racial profiling , while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants			0
in @entity6 , the city councils of @entity41 and @entity42 have decided to challenge the new immigration law in court			1
@entity2 told @entity46 's " @entity47 " program that one concern about the @entity6 law is that " you 'll end up in a situation where people are racially profiled , and that could lead to a wedge drawn between certain communities and law enforcement , which leads to the problem of people in those communities not willing to interact with people in law enforcement , not willing to share information , not willing to be witnesses where law enforcement needs them			1
" " i think we could potentially get on a slippery slope where people will be picked on because of how they look as opposed to what they have done , and that is , i think , something that we have to try to avoid at all costs , " @entity2 added			0
@entity2 said comprehensive federal immigration reform is the best approach for the problem of illegal immigrants crossing @entity22 borders			2
his stance echoed the approach favored by president @entity79 , who last week criticized the @entity6 law and said he wants @entity80 to work on the issue this year			2
@entity83 immigration reform would include continuing government efforts to secure borders from illegal immigrants , as well as steps to crack down on businesses that employ them , @entity79 said at a @entity90 celebration at the @entity91			0
in addition , he said , those living illegally in the @entity22 would have to pay a penalty and any taxes they owe , learn @entity97 and " make themselves right with the law " before starting the process of gaining @entity22 citizenship .			0
