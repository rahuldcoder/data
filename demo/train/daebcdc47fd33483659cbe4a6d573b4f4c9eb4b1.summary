-- it may be more important to tell you what is not motivating my trip to see @entity6			1
i am not looking to spar about his " friend , " the much - maligned ruler of @entity10 , or to debate the merits of basketball diplomacy in that country when i sit down to talk with him live friday morning			1
@entity6 can speak to an issue that is a bigger threat to our country than @entity17 : addiction			1
@entity6 may be in the fight of and for his life , and it is a battle all too familiar these days			1
i want to talk to him about that , his recent bottom , what has kept him from sobriety			2
and hopefully he is willing to talk about the challenges and the benefits of rehab , as readily as he discusses the virtues of his despot " friend			2
" maybe that friendship has metaphoric value for @entity6 : keeping cozy with his own demons , abusing drugs to hide from himself -- just as he hid from the reality of that country and its ruler ? too far ? probably , but he is face - to - face with a battle that too many are fighting and losing			2
i want to see how much fight the hardwood warrior has in him to get sober and treat his illness			0
i hope he is as fired up about his future as he was in our last interview about defending his friend			0
@entity6 defiant in odd @entity10 defense @entity6 to @entity52 : i do n't give a s * * * the last time we talked it was earlier this month while he was in @entity56 for a basketball game on @entity17 's birthday			1
i did n't intend to get into a joust with the former @entity61 star , but believe it or not , @entity6 is the @entity63 citizen with the most direct line to a dictator with nuclear weapons , and i needed to ask him some questions about the political nature of his trip			1
so i asked him about the plight of prisoner @entity71 , and his antics made headlines			0
he said later he was drunk during the interview and when he got back to the @entity63 , he checked into a rehab center			0
this time we 're going to talk in person			0
i want to know , i want to see for myself , how he 's doing in the biggest battle of his life			0
what do you think i should ask him ? reach out to me on @entity82 or @entity83			0
watch @entity84 weekdays at 6am - 9am et. for the latest on @entity84 click here			2
