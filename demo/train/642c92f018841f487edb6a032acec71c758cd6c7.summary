@entity0 , @entity1 a proud laborer from @entity4 , @entity5 picked fruit in the orchards of @entity8 , but when his most valuable tools -- his hands -- became injured last year			1
he fell into deep despair			0
he could n't work or send money to family in @entity4 , two routines that shaped his life			1
it was this misfortune that distressed @entity5 in the days before he and police in the town of @entity0 clashed in february , in a confrontation that ended with officers firing a total of 17 bullets , hitting @entity5 several times and killing him			1
he was unarmed but was accused of pelting police with rocks			1
his killing is now cited by family and @entity29 activists as another national example of officers using excessive lethal force against unarmed men , often minority men			1
the police shooting of @entity5 , 35 , now haunts his family , due in no small measure to how the hail of police bullets was captured on videos and posted on @entity42 by bystanders			1
" @entity50 , " as loved ones called him , was one of 16 children , and he migrated to the @entity46 about 10 years ago to join other relatives and harvest food on farms , said his mother , @entity52			1
that police fired 17 bullets at one of her 16 children leaves the mother aghast , she said			1
" my son was a happy person , a hard worker and he got along with his siblings , " the mother said last week in an interview with @entity2 en @entity60 shortly after a funeral service for her son at @entity0 's @entity63			1
" i had not seen him in 10 years , but i would talk to him over the phone , " said the mother , who traveled to @entity0 from her rural home in the central @entity4 state of @entity70 for her son 's funeral			1
" i felt good that he was here			0
he was happy , and as a mother that was good for me , " she said			0
it was at a funeral home where the 60 - year - old @entity5 saw her son for the first time in a decade			0
more precisely , what she saw was his body			0
" imagine so many years without seeing him and to come and see him in this situation			1
for a mother , it 's heartbreaking , something you never hope for or want to happen to your children , " @entity5 said			1
the video of officers gunning down @entity5 keeps playing over and over in the minds of the family			1
the tape shows @entity5 running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot			2
police have said that @entity5 was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by police			2
he then allegedly stoned two officers , and police resorted to deadly force , authorities said			2
officers had used a taser on him , but it was n't effective , police said			2
from what the mother has seen of the video , she noticed her son is n't shown throwing rocks			0
" i do n't see him throwing rocks			0
the only thing i can see is that he 's running , he raises his hands and they still shoot him			1
why ? i ask myself			0
why ? " @entity5 said			0
" and when he falls , they still handcuff him , and that is what hurts me the most			0
" @entity5 ' family said his limited @entity126 left him unable to understand the officers ' commands , shouted in @entity126			2
more than half of @entity0 's 68,000 residents are @entity29			2
of the 71 sworn officers in the police department , 12 are certified as fluent in @entity60 , a spokesman said			2
@entity5 now wants justice for her son			2
" i ask for justice to be done because it 's not right what they did to my son , " @entity5 said			1
@entity140 , an aunt of @entity5 , also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events , she said			2
" we are living with profound pain from how he died , and it 's something very bad and terrible , " the aunt said			1
" i look at the videos now and i can not sleep because it 's too hard			2
" the police killing of @entity5 has left the family grief - stricken and torn apart			1
in fact , a rift has developed between his mother 's family and his former wife , @entity157 , 32 , who 's also mother to his two young daughters			1
each side commissioned a separate autopsy on @entity5 ' body			0
the mother and the former wife have n't spoken to one another for years			2
in fact , @entity5 and the former wife had been separated for many years , according to the mother and the former wife 's attorney			1
in all , the case involves three autopsies , including the one conducted by authorities			0
in a surprising revelation this past week , one of the autopsies appeared to conflict with the official account			0
the autopsy commissioned by @entity157 and her attorney appeared to show that @entity5 had bullet wounds to the buttocks and the back of the arm			0
that is at odds with what authorities said a day earlier , when @entity189 sgt. @entity188 told reporters , " we do know this from the preliminary autopsy report , there were no shots in the back			0
" @entity195 police belong to a team of local law agencies , called the @entity198 , that is conducting an independent investigation of the police shooting of @entity5 in @entity0			1
@entity204 prosecuting attorney @entity203 declined to comment this week on how the conflict between the two autopsies			0
@entity203 was shown a copy of a body diagram in the second autopsy , conducted by the former wife 's side , he said			2
" our office is waiting for complete reports from both pathologists before making any conclusions , " @entity203 said in a statement			0
" there are several questions that will be answered in the final pathology reports including number of gunshot wounds , number of bullets recovered , bullet trajectories , etc. , " @entity203 said			0
ultimately , an inquest jury will " decide what information is significant to the cause and manner of death and whether anyone is criminally liable for mr. @entity5 's death , " @entity203 said			2
@entity5 's mother said her son married @entity157 in a church ceremony in @entity4 more than 10 years ago , but the marriage was n't officially registered with civil records			1
@entity157 could n't be reached for comment , but her attorney , @entity239 , acknowledged his client 's church marriage in @entity4 and asserted that @entity157 is the legal wife and widow of @entity5			1
the couple had been separated for " quite some time , " and @entity157 and the couple 's two daughters now live in @entity247 , @entity243 said			2
meanwhile , @entity157 and her two children this week withdrew a $ 25 million claim against the city of @entity0 alleging that officers killed @entity5 " execution style , " @entity243 said			0
@entity243 said his client wants to do more research and investigation into the shooting			2
the former wife plans to file a renewed claim at a later date , @entity243 said			0
for her part , @entity5 - @entity5 ' mother has hired attorney @entity262 , who has represented the families of @entity264 and @entity265 , both young @entity267 - @entity46 men whose deaths caused national protests			1
@entity264 , 19 , was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer in @entity271 , @entity272 ; the officer was cleared of criminal wrongdoing			1
@entity265 , 17 , was also unarmed when he was fatally shot in a physical confrontation in @entity276 with former neighborhood watch captain @entity277 , who was later acquitted of a murder charge by a jury			0
meanwhile , the @entity4 consul in @entity281 , @entity282 , has written a letter to @entity0 police chief @entity284 expressing " deep concern over the unwarranted use of lethal force against an unarmed @entity4 national by police officers			1
" @entity5 ' mother and family have asked @entity46 attorney general @entity292 to conduct " a full , fair and complete investigation " into the killing , according to a friday letter provided by the mother 's attorney			1
the @entity300 office in @entity281 is monitoring the case , a spokesman said			0
also , the @entity303 in @entity281 " is monitoring the investigation of this use of force , conducted by the @entity198 , " @entity303 spokeswoman @entity302 in @entity281 said			0
meanwhile , @entity29 community leaders in @entity0 met wednesday with the @entity46 attorney for @entity1 , @entity309 , and assistant u.s. attorney a. @entity310 , according to the group @entity29			1
the meeting lasted two and a half hours , the group said			0
that organization is advancing a community demand for a @entity46 @entity300 inquiry into @entity5 ' killing because of " widely - held community beliefs that the local police investigation of the police shooting was perceived as a conflict of interest and was lacking in credibility and impartiality , " @entity29 said			1
according to the group , the federal prosecutor 's office will provide remedies and suggestions to @entity0 police on their practices and procedures			1
for now , @entity5 - @entity5 ' mother has taken control over her son 's body , which she plans to send to @entity4 for burial on a little ranch called @entity336 in the @entity70 municipality of @entity338 , she said			1
the former wife is n't contesting the mother 's control over @entity5 ' body , said @entity243 , attorney for the former wife			0
the plot is near where the mother and her family live , in the mountains far from people			0
in fact , they must walk a good distance just to go shopping , @entity5 said			0
his burial has been delayed because the mother commissioned an autopsy on her son in @entity276 , conducted this past week , and she has ordered more tests on his remains			0
his grave will mark the end to a long journey			0
he came to the @entity46 looking for his own @entity46 dream , @entity5 's family said			1
but he left the world through what his family says is a continuing nightmare			0
