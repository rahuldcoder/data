-- more than 11 years after the start of the war in @entity4 , there is some cause to celebrate and some reason to worry			1
but more than anything , maybe , there are questions			0
those questions were on display friday as presidents @entity12 and @entity13 met in @entity14 to discuss the future of @entity4 and the @entity17 ' role there			1
@entity20 in @entity4 is gasping for air			1
before the @entity17 invaded in 2001 , the @entity22 forbade women to even come out of their homes			1
now women have more freedom -- more than 2 million girls are going to school			0
more than 300,000 @entity4 children who live in the country are on @entity30			1
but it 's not all good news			0
military and civilian deaths continue			0
contributing on the military side is the phenomenon dubbed " green - on - blue " or " insider " attacks			0
of the more than 2,000 @entity17 deaths since the 2001 invasion , an increasing number have come at the hands of the @entity4 they trusted and trained			1
it 's worse for @entity4			2
@entity45 are victims of a greater number of these insider attacks , a @entity44 spokesman told @entity0 friday			0
and consider some of the events of 2012 : the year began with a video showing @entity51 urinating on dead @entity4			2
published photos showed @entity17 troops posing with corpses and @entity17 soldiers burned @entity56 at @entity57 , apparently an act committed out of ignorance that it offended @entity60			1
presidents agree to speed transition then there 's @entity66 staff sgt. @entity65 , accused of rampaging through an @entity4 village , murdering 17 @entity4 civilians , including women and children			1
on friday , the two presidents agreed to accelerate the military transition in @entity4			1
@entity4 forces will take the lead in combat missions throughout the country starting in spring , instead of midyear as was previously expected			2
even though @entity12 and @entity13 agreed on some issues , others remain			2
who 's in control ? first , @entity13 is n't eligible to run for reelection in 2014			1
because the country has a constitution and a working government , it 's likely that at least some of the points he and @entity12 agree to could be carried out when he 's out of power			0
but no one can say for sure , analysts note			0
so far , who would run for president after @entity13 is unclear , though some intriguing names have been bandied around			2
on the ground , @entity17 officials have said anywhere between zero to 9,000 @entity17 forces could remain in @entity4 past 2014			1
not only will they perhaps have to operate in the tense green - on - blue environment , @entity17 trainers who are teaching @entity4 military enlistees how to fight say they are under enormous pressure to meet numbers at the sacrifice of quality , experts say			1
@entity106 , an @entity17 journalist who has spent years off and on in @entity4 , most recently in december 2011 , said a @entity17 contractor who is training @entity4 recruits complained to her that he does n't have to thoroughly do his job			1
" there has been a huge amount of pressure to put as many bodies in @entity4 uniform as possible to meet 2013 deadlines , " she said			2
" he thought he had ok people but he did n't have time to pick out who was best and train the ones who needed extra help			0
" the " overwhelming majority " of them are coming from " ordinary @entity4 signing up for the military , " experienced war correspondent @entity125 has reported			1
what 's the tab ? this week , @entity13 gave the @entity44 a wish list of hardware such as drones and helicopters that he said would help him continue to fight terrorists			2
no dollar amount has been decided			0
estimates range from $ 1 billion to $ 10 billion a year -- and that includes military expenses , hardware and training , the whole deal that @entity4 could n't afford on its own			1
" these are really funny numbers because no one knows the extent of what the @entity17 is willing to offer , " @entity106 notes			2
whatever amount @entity12 administration floats will have to win approval from @entity148			0
former @entity17 ambassador to @entity4 @entity150 told @entity0 friday that he thinks the total bill is going to depend on military presence			1
at a minimum , he figures , the @entity17 will spend $ 5 billion in aid and military , not counting what would be spent for embassy costs			1
those numbers can not be calculated in a vacuum , either			0
as a discussion at the @entity161 involving the former @entity17 ambassador to @entity4 noted , @entity4 is facing a major economic downturn after 2014			1
a lot of money that has gone into @entity4 has been wasted , numerous reports have shown			2
in 2011 , one nonpartisan group told @entity148 that the @entity17 was wasting $ 12 million a day among contracts issued to support @entity17 efforts in @entity170 and @entity4 , @entity0 reported			1
even @entity13 , prompted by a question from a reporter , said friday " we have corruption			2
" opinion : abandon @entity4 ? a dumb idea who is the @entity17 talking with and why ? last may , @entity12 made a surprise visit to @entity4 , where he gave a speech about the end of the war			1
he said , " we 're pursuing a negotiated peace " with the @entity22			0
to be clear , @entity20 and the @entity22 are two different entities , though there are ties			0
@entity20 is a terrorist group created by @entity19			0
the @entity22 has provided shelter and support to @entity20			0
in its newest incarnation , the @entity22 has new , and some younger - generation , members who say they want to find peace with the @entity17			2
in short , this is a complicated topic , as @entity192 detailed in december			0
former ambassador @entity150 said it 's wrong to call it a negotiation			0
instead , he said , it 's " a group of multiple players we are only talking to			0
we are trying to see if there 's negotiating room			0
" on the @entity4 side , a november poll by the independent @entity203 - based group @entity202 found that more than half of @entity4 felt that their country was moving in the right direction			2
that includes agreeing with the negotiation of government officials and those trying to work toward peace to talk with and find common ground with militants			0
will the @entity17 public stay interested ? there were complaints during the @entity17 presidential election that @entity12 and @entity220 challenger @entity219 did not talk enough about @entity4			1
but polls have shown that most @entity17 are tired of the war			1
a @entity0 / @entity224 poll in september showed that only 3 % named @entity4 as one of the most important issues facing the @entity17			1
earlier in 2012 , @entity0 polling indicated that only 25 % of @entity17 favored the war , and 55 % said the @entity17 should remove all of its troops before 2014			1
defense secretary @entity230 pushed back against that figure at the time , saying polls do n't fight wars			0
and this week he reiterated his opposition to taking the number of troops in @entity4 down to a paltry sum , and said zero is out of the question for him			1
if the @entity17 military does n't have a strong presence there , the chances of talking -- or negotiating -- with the @entity22 is diminished , he argued			1
@entity150 said he thinks the @entity17 public is disinterested in a war that has dragged on for so many years			1
that 's a hurtful thing to hear for military families who have endured so much			0
@entity247 , a journalist and longtime military culture blogger , is disheartened by such talk			0
her husband has done multiple tours in @entity4 and is preparing to go back			2
" it 's offensive to me to hear that from people who have n't had skin in the game , that they are weary , " she said			0
" we still have troops fighting , sacrificing time with their families			0
all of that is much harder when you do n't feel like your country is behind you			0
" opinion : @entity12 should be honest with @entity13 read more : defense officials to press @entity13 on what he needs read more : karzai visit a time for tough talk on security , corruption @entity0 's @entity272 contributed to this report .			0

new : the two presidents agree to accelerate the military transition
the @entity278 has floated the idea of leaving no troops in @entity4 after 2014
questions include who will follow @entity13 and how much it will cost
polls show a low level of interest in the war among @entity17
