-- ah , springtime ! when a young single person 's fancy turns to quiet desperation			0
the darling buds of april have shaken off their veils of snow , and you , dear reader , have done likewise with your veils of fleece and @entity13 - induced despair			1
months of picnics , outdoor shows and wine - sodden nights in summertime finery ( or , at the very least , jean shorts and well - worn wife beaters -- however it is you roll ) stretch out before you			2
now all you need is someone to share them with , right ? might we suggest spending those last few weeks of mixed - bag weather doing what any red - blooded human does when they 're looking for answers : stay inside and troll the @entity30			2
" i 've tried looking online for love ! " you may cry -- quite literally			1
" @entity34 was too arty ( and unemployed ) for my tastes , @entity33 was replete with pleats and @entity37 ! and @entity38 , well ... i need a shower			0
sometimes you do n't really want to wade through suite after suite of suitors to find the perfect co-picnicker -- i mean , we live in a society where we want everything from our coffee to our movies to be instant			0
so why not narrow down the search a bit via a superspecific online dating site ? seriously , guys , there 's someone out there for everyone , and apparently some enterprising developers ( just the folks you should trust for love advice ) have gone and cataloged them all			1
read on for three extremely calculating sites for satiating that aforementioned quiet desperation			2
( @entity66 : shared interests do n't always equate to true love -- we know this			1
mostly we just find these sites amusing			2
) if you like to sweat on a date ( in a nonsexy way ) ... from the running track to the weight room to the yoga studio you roam , counting the multiplying packs of your abs , marinating in your own sweat and hoping against hope that that dude -- the one who always parks his yoga mat unnecessarily close to yours , making for optimal ass - viewing -- will ask you to go for a smoothie after the last " @entity86			2
" usually you 're so bold -- you with your hot pink spandex and ability to bench - press your twin bed			2
but in his presence , all you can do to contain your ardor is assume a child 's pose and weep salty , sweat - mingled tears			0
well , muscle - bound dear , dry your eyes ( and perhaps take a shower , too )			0
there 's a dating site out there specifically designed for you : @entity102			1
this free ( for the time being ) @entity104 - based matchmaking machine allows folks who like to work out to find other folks who like to work out to ... you know , work out / make out with			1
the site even organizes events where singles can mingle and run around and stuff			0
yup , on this site , a red face is more likely to connote the blush of love , rather than an abrupt cessation of physical exertion			1
if ' our song ' is likely to be super obscure ... in recent years , you have taken to going to shows alone , parking yourself in the corner with a brimming glass of whiskey and a brimming heart -- and no one to share them with			0
yes , in the past , suitors have attempted to share your love -- nay , indefatigable passion -- for music			0
but many , obviously intimidated by your vast breadth of knowledge , have left mix tapes half composed ( @entity136 ? seriously ? ) , attempted to talk to you while your third - favorite @entity138 band took the stage , and -- perhaps most unsettlingly -- just put their ipods on shuffle while y'all were making out			1
luckily for you , there 's a free resource on the market that will help you avoid anyone out there who " likes everything but rap and country " : @entity152			1
the site allows you to easily port over your musical interests from @entity156 or @entity157 so as to weed out anyone not familiar with that most important holiday in the world , @entity161			1
the site even has a feature whereby you can search for events in your area and people to attend them with , so perhaps you can share that whiskey ( and heart ) with someone special , or at least sort of special , next time around			0
you 're a social media ' ninja ' ... you have so many friends			0
seriously , like 10,000 @entity175 followers , a million stalkers on @entity173 , and @entity156 -- well , let 's just say you had to create a fan page for yourself after you hit the friend limit			0
if a potential date wants to get on your radar , they 'll have to send you a tweet			0
you 're just so superbusy at - replying , posting interesting articles to your friends ' walls and checking into the bodega around the corner each night when you pick up your frozen pizza for one ( got ta maintain that @entity190 ! )			0
still , sometimes -- amidst the pings , love - red notifications and badges -- you feel a deep , dark force sucking at your heart			1
an emptiness even @entity197 for @entity198 failed to fill			0
somewhere out there , however , there 's another soul aching and tweeting and pinging right along with you , and a little site called @entity204 aims to act as your guide through the morass of online social interactions			1
for about $ 15 a pop , @entity204 matches up potential soulmates based on their @entity210 scores ( a service that measures your social influence online ) as well as other factors , and sets up phone dates so they can get to know each other the only way they know how -- from the comfort of their own cave - like homes .			1

here are three niche sites for those who want to narrow the vast online - dating pool
@entity102 is a dating site specifically for those who love to work out
@entity152 allows you to easily port over your musical interests
for about $ 15 a pop , @entity204 matches potential soulmates based on their @entity210 scores
