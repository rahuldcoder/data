-- my oh my @entity1 ! @entity1 did an in - your - face , look at me now , pornographic performance at the record industry 's most public coming out party , the @entity8 video music awards			1
she did every porn star move in the book , and the only thing different was that there was n't actual genital connection , and her seemingly sprayed on rubber undies and bra did cover her private parts			0
what was @entity1 thinking ? you do n't have to guess			2
she was probably thinking : " i 'm not that @entity1 anymore and this ought to prove it			2
" it 's shocking all right			0
but let 's face it			1
a 20 - year - old these days is unlikely to be a virgin and if she 's in the fast lane ( read : @entity31 , @entity32 and other big cities ) she is not going to look innocent			0
shocked at @entity1 ? have you noticed your average 15 - year - old girl lately ? she has her midriff bared , she 's wearing her underwear for the world to see and her skirt may or may not cover her butt and crotch			1
outraged parents : what was @entity1 thinking ? it 's hard to take it as parents			1
we know how young 15 really is			0
hell , we know how young 20 is			0
my guess is after @entity1 has finished with her personally satisfying pr moment from this , she 's going to tone it down eventually			1
but right now , this is her battle cry : i am a fully sexual , bad - assed vixen and live with it			0
how should we integrate this new human being with the little girl @entity56 promoted as wholesome and childlike ? maybe a better use of our time is to think about the models of sexuality that are in most rock groups and how we talk to our kids about them			2
the metaphors in the lyrics and bump and grind moves in the videos have been around for quite a while			0
so how do we tell our children that they can be young men and women without looking and acting , like rock performers ? well , this is a well - beaten drum i 'm going to pound , but we have to talk to them about how that is show business , and that in real life , a little bit of subtlety goes a long way			1
that ultimately , in this turtle and hare story , the more discriminating , less crudely sexual person wins the girl or guy 's love , and a lot of other good things in life			2
@entity1 upholds @entity92 tradition we can give the talk without having to link this performance to abstinence before marriage , or that sexuality per se is wrong or bad for you			1
the statistics will tell you that approach is , for most parents , a losing game			0
but research does tell us that parent 's opinions and values really do matter on quite a number of sexual issues			0
we can take a middle road			0
take this performance ( and others ) as a teachable moment and do what all reputable sex education courses tell us to do -- talk about your own values and why you have them and why they matter			0
while sexuality can be expressed in our dress and behavior , there are far better ways for young women to be attractive and appealing			1
it can not be said that @entity1 made a wrong career choice : look at the press coverage ! but modeling porn - star appearance and performance is a dangerous choice for our young people			1
i do n't think we are ever going to get our teenagers and young adults back in saddle shoes ( except as a sly joke ) but i do think we can show them that @entity1 ' act is a sexual cartoon and that they can put themselves together and act in a way that will make them far more popular and desirable in the long run than what they see in a @entity8 award show			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			2

@entity1 's performance at the @entity8 video music awards show stunned *viewers*
@entity149 : let 's face it , young women today are *flaunting* their sexuality
she says we need to tell kids that in real life , a little bit of subtlety goes a long way
@entity149 : there are far better ways for young women to be attractive and appealing
