discipline is a key ingredient in the package required to succeed in the world of professional golf			2
@entity5 has not been found wanting in that department on her journey from military kid to major champion			1
the 2010 @entity11 winner and darling of the @entity13 is the daughter of a @entity15 officer			1
the 25 - year - old has racked up earnings of $ 9 million in her career so far and has decided the time has come to contribute to the military cause			1
through her charitable foundation @entity5 already helps to fund promising young golfers in the @entity23 and @entity24 -- now she wants to dedicate a large chunk of her time assisting people whose lives pivot around service to their country			1
with @entity23 still engaged in combat operations in @entity31 and some of its military personnel still in @entity33 , @entity5 is offering support to wives and families of soldiers , veterans and reserves as well as those in active service			1
giving it back : @entity44 's ' @entity43 ' invests in future stars " i would n't be where i 'm at today if it was n't for the soldiers and everybody that fights for us , " she told @entity47			1
" i wanted something that i could truly relate to and i could really feel that all my hard work , my time and everything i do is going to go to , and that 's the military			2
" family service @entity5 's father @entity59 flew for the @entity15 for 22 years before retiring in 1997			1
her uncle and her cousin are @entity62 -- the latter went to @entity33 for eight months , and he is currently stationed at the @entity64			0
growing up in a military family , @entity5 was expected to display the same kind of discipline that was such a vital component of her father 's job			1
" i did n't understand why i had to do all my homework before i could go out and have fun , " she explains			0
" i said , ' @entity73 you ca n't have these rules , i 'm not in the military			0
' " but now , @entity5 says : " i 'm grateful for it , i do n't know any different ; there are no excuses when you are in the military , you live and fight till the death -- that 's kind of how he has looked at everything			1
" she is hoping to supplement a system in which the @entity86 offers pensions and compensations to the soldiers ' widows , taking into consideration the spouse 's military experience and the income of the widow			1
helping those left behind @entity5 knows firsthand the strain that can be put on the families of those that serve -- a common scenario being that wives run the family home while their husbands are locked in combat on the front line			1
" my cousin has four sons , and his wife had to take care of four kids from the ages of one to six while he was gone			0
i 've seen what these wives had to go through because their husbands are taking care of us			2
i think that 's remarkable			2
" the soldiers should get all the credit , but the wives are definitively up there with them , they 're the ones that make them want to come home and stay strong and fight			1
" of the many memories @entity5 retains from her childhood , one of the fondest is when her father dressed up in his military whites for a wedding			1
@entity5 's mother @entity136 recalls : " her cousin got married , he had a military wedding at @entity133 and everybody wore whites			1
@entity5 saw them going through the swords and she was young , wiggly , but she enjoyed that			2
" during his time in the @entity15 , @entity5 's father was primed for action twice -- in @entity144 and during the first @entity145 -- but never deployed			1
@entity147 's call - up @entity5 was 10 when her father retired , but he continued his role as a commercial pilot for @entity150			1
still , the family 's army links went on			2
when @entity5 graduated from high school and became a fulltime @entity13 member in 2005 , her cousin was on a tour of duty in @entity33			2
" i wore an up - pin on my lapel that was his company and battalion insignia , " she explains			0
" i wore it every round of golf i played starting the day they deployed to show support of @entity165 and all the brave men and women under his command during their entire deployment to @entity33			2
" i did not take it off until the final member of his command returned to @entity23 soil			0
" now that she has decided to lend her support to army families , @entity5 has picked the perfect person to help her vision become a reality -- her dad			1
" to me he 's the best person for it , as he has a lot of ties within the military and he 's going to want to make it as big as we possibly can			0
i think he is a perfect person to take ownership in that sense			0
" finding funding born in @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity5 now lives in @entity191 , @entity192			2
she is hoping to spread her project across the country			0
" it is hard to say no to people who fight for all of us and our country , i have a big soft spot for them ; it was the way i grew up , to respect that , " she says			0
" appreciating others ' sacrifices , even simple chivalry -- how a man treats a woman , and also how you conduct yourself in front of people -- those are all rules that i 've always lived by and i feel it is important that i give back			0
" her ultimate goal is to hold a tournament to raise money for the cause , and have both male and female stars along for the ride			0
" i want to have a professional event , that would be my dream , we 've talked a lot about it , " she says			0
" logistics-wise i 'd love to have it with the men , that would be a lot of fun to do and it 'd bring a lot of interest			0
these days a lot of the guys have foundations that not necessarily are for the military but they are tying back to military things			0
" it can be daunting for someone so young to set such an organization , so @entity5 has enlisted the help of friend and tennis pro @entity241 , who runs the @entity242 , founded in memory of his father			1
she has also been to the @entity246 , which treats injured service personnel -- a visit she describes as inspirational			0
" it was probably one of the most eye - opening experiences i 've had in my life			0
getting to know people that just had their leg amputated , there are no words to describe how i felt			0
it puts everything into perspective			0
