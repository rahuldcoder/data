-- the @entity2 epidemic in @entity3 is playing out before the world 's eyes			1
each new update about the disease 's spread is breathless ; each new detail is related with dramatic flourish			2
" @entity12 " reads one headline ; " @entity2 outbreak is ' out of control , ' " says another			1
meanwhile , on tuesday , workers in hazmat suits carefully transported a second @entity18 patient with the disease to an @entity21 hospital for treatment			2
it is no wonder people are frightened of @entity2 despite the fact that an outbreak has never happened in a developed country			1
" what if @entity2 just wipes us out ? " one @entity29 user asked			1
our fears are reflections of an infectious disease narrative fed to the public for years -- by health officials , by the media and through a potent story delivered in books and movies about the " @entity42 , " experts say			1
the drama of infection , and the horrible death wrought by @entity2 , only adds to our morbid attention			1
" we 're fascinated by epidemics , " said @entity47 , director of the public health program at the @entity49			2
" what we see on this side of the ocean is poor people dying , and doctors and health aides in space suits			0
9 questions about this new @entity2 drug " it looks like the movies , and we 've been prepped for a cinematic response , " he said -- for the plot to unfold much like it does in a film			1
" people perceive this as a very dramatic disease , " said @entity66 , a science writer and the author of " spillover : @entity72 and the @entity73			2
" " there is almost hysterical fear about @entity2 on behalf of distant people in developed countries who think , ' this is going to come and get us			1
' " hysteria tends to take hold , experts say , the moment that health officials label an outbreak of disease an epidemic or pandemic			1
@entity89 , author of " contagious : cultures , carriers , and the @entity96 " and an @entity98 professor at @entity99 , says those pronouncements are often the beginning of an " outbreak narrative			2
" " a terrifying disease , easily transmitted , spreads from a developing country and threatens to become apocalyptic , " she says , roughly summarizing the plot of movies such as " outbreak " and books such as " @entity105			1
" " that story has been told so many times , even when people hear one piece of that story , that one element may invoke the entire narrative , " she says			2
conflating movie images with reality , and seeing those same images cycled through newscasts , may explain the roots of our fears about infectious diseases generally , but there is a deeper quality to our consternation about @entity2			1
" @entity2 has been the disease people around the world love to fear , " says @entity66 , adding that the @entity127 outbreak in 2003 infected thousands more people than the current @entity2 outbreak yet caused significantly less worry			1
" @entity127 was n't as dramatic in terms of symptoms , " he said			0
" it was n't as vividly gruesome as this disease sometimes is			0
" an @entity2 infection can cause profuse internal bleeding			1
one online commenter interpreted it as " ... your internal organs rot into a bloody pulp and you 're living through it			0
" @entity47 says , " sometimes we 're morbidly fascinated with diseases that are disfiguring			0
" @entity47 , author of " dread : how @entity153 and @entity152 from the @entity154 to @entity155 , " compares current attitudes about @entity2 with how people decades ago feared leprosy , another disease that is not highly contagious			1
our anxiety tends to overshadow facts about the disease that could temper our unease , he says			0
ebola outbreaks have occurred only sporadically since strains of the virus were first identified in the mid- 1970s			0
the outbreaks have tended to appear , affect a few hundred people and eventually fizzle out			0
( considering that history , the current outbreak that 's killed more than 900 people might be cast as an unsettling anomaly			0
) what you need to know about @entity2 when an @entity2 outbreak is investigated , the source of an infection usually points back to an animal			1
the virus infects , say , a chimp or gorilla , and a human who has close contact with that animal becomes infected			0
coming into contact with , or eating , the types of animals that become infected with @entity2 would be a highly unusual scenario in the @entity18 -- as unusual as mass human - to - human infection			1
still , ambivalence is not the attitude we should have when it comes to diseases such as @entity2 , says @entity89 , the " @entity192 " author			1
we should have some level of deference to @entity2 's virulence ; it kills between 60 % to 90 % of the people it infects			1
at the same time , it must be acknowledged that becoming infected is difficult			0
" should you be scared ? yes and no , " @entity89 says			0
" you should n't be impervious to the situation			0
you should experience an appropriate level of concern without allowing it to spiral into unrealistic panic			0
" @entity66 says , " ( @entity205 ) should be scared in a rational way			0
but to be simply scared that this is the boogeyman that 's going to come and get us is ignorant and wrong			0
" @entity2 is horrible , he adds , " but it has killed far fewer people than things we think of as mundane diseases like measles , influenza and malaria			1
" in other words , @entity66 says not to buy into the cultural myth , the sort of drama that has suffused the conversation about @entity2			2
for some , that may be easier said than done			0
what is the risk of catching @entity2 on a plane ? the difficulty with corralling our fears is that at the root of our despair is potentially something basic , even natural			2
perhaps @entity2 fears are a proxy for heavier questions we may be subconsciously pondering about our collective demise			2
" we humans dread death , " @entity47 says in his book			0
" it is only natural that the mass mortality brought by great plague makes us afraid			0
" @entity66 , who has written extensively about fears of " @entity244 " -- the virus that could wipe us out -- says that @entity2 is not it			2
in a recent @entity249 editorial , he said @entity2 is not " ... an incipient pandemic destined to circle the world , as some anxious observers might imagine			2
it 's a very grim and local misery , visited upon a small group of unfortunate @entity254 , toward whom we should bow in sympathy and continue sending help			0
" it 's not about our fears and dreads			0
" @entity2 is here : 5 reasons not to panic experimental drug likely saved @entity2 patients economic ' scare factor ' adds to misery			1

an infectious disease narrative has been fed to public for years , experts say
the horrible death wrought by @entity2 adds to our morbid fascination , they say
expert : " it looks like the movies , and we 've been prepped for a cinematic response "
