-- most people do n't go through life without hitting a few bumps along the way			2
for @entity6 , that 's putting it mildly			1
@entity6 , 28 , is sitting on top of the boxing world right now			1
in december , he won the light welterweight championship of the world , an achievement that was 18 years in the making			1
" i feel blessed just to be here in this spot , " he said			0
" it could have been many other places i could 've been			0
@entity6 is one of 12 siblings			1
growing up in @entity20 , things were going well until their father went to prison on a drug offense			0
they lost their home , and shortly thereafter their mother abandoned them , leaving the kids to fend for themselves			0
@entity6 was 10 years old at the time			1
some of the siblings latched on with friends			0
but @entity6 and his younger brother , @entity31 , were on their own			1
at times they had no place to stay and were forced to sleep on park benches , in abandoned cars and at a local @entity39 bus station			0
sometimes they just walked the streets , waiting for the sun to come up			2
" you 'd play with your friends and you 'd have fun all day , and then you knew at the end of the day , once it got to a certain time , your friends were going to go home			0
they 'd be in their beds , warm , and you knew that you was n't , " said @entity6			1
and @entity6 had to look after @entity31 , who was two years his junior			1
that situation became even more stressful when other city kids challenged them			0
" he 'd have to fight for me because i was so small , " said the younger @entity6			1
" i guess that 's how he got his fighting skills going and protecting me			0
" a few months later , the @entity6 boys met boxing trainer @entity61 , and it changed their lives			1
" they were just coming out of the shelter , " said @entity61			1
" i met @entity6 and brought him to the gym , and i brought @entity31 the next time			1
we 've been together ever since			0
" that was 18 years ago			0
@entity61 took them in and gave the boys more than just boxing lessons ; he gave them life lessons			1
" those are my boys , man , i ca n't say nothing bad about them			1
i 'm totally proud of ' em , " said @entity61			2
last december , the discipline and work ethic @entity61 instilled in the boys resulted in @entity6 winning the light welterweight world championship			1
" it 's something i 've been working for a long time , " said @entity6			2
" eighteen years now ... all the hard work paying off is just a great feeling			0
" it was a hard - fought bout with then - champion @entity85 of the @entity86 , a close match that some think could have gone either way			2
a rematch is in the works			0
but for now @entity6 holds the title -- which also means a seven - figure payday			2
that kind of money is especially meaningful for a person who once slept on the streets , and is now the father of a 3 - year - old girl			2
" it 's a great feeling to know that ... my daughter ... she 'll be ok , said @entity6			2
" as long as i do right by , you know , the money that i earn , that she 'll be ok			0
she 'll never have to see those days			0
" despite his success , @entity6 said , he 'll never forget what happened when he was a child			2
he 's proof that it 's never over unless you give up			0
" just because you 're dealt a bad hand do n't mean you 're going to lose			1
you can always change it around , " he said .			0
