-- remember being a kid , stuck home from school because you were sick , and " @entity4 " would come on ? i was that kid , and @entity6 was that kid , too			2
the difference between us is that when i was choosing college classes by their attendance policy , @entity6 graduated from @entity11 with a degree in applied math -- and then used what he learned to figure out how to win at " @entity4			2
" when @entity6 , a staff writer at @entity16 , discovered that there were collections of data based on the outcomes of the over 70 pricing games from the show , the mathematician inside leaped at the chance to look for patterns , and he found a few places where a person could not only do better than chance , but even win 100 % of the time ! now , a couple caveats : this is just based on a few years of data ( @entity6 says each game is played about 10 times a year ) so the samples are n't perfect , and you ca n't use math to win every game ( so , sadly , @entity38 perfection remains painfully out of reach )			1
however , he outlines a couple tips that could help you up your game at home -- or even , should you get the chance , on set			2
bet better the game -- @entity49 's row : the first stop for anyone on the show is " @entity49 's row , " where four players chosen from the audience bet on a featured prize , and the person closest to the correct price without going over wins			1
@entity6 went through show transcripts for five years and compiled the data to figure out what is best to do			2
the tip : bet $ 1 higher than the highest bid			1
according to @entity6 's data , the last person to bid wins 35 % of the time , but if they guessed $ 1 higher than the highest bid , they would win 53.8 % of the time			1
why it works : people are afraid to overbid , because you definitely lose if you bid too high , so they typically bid a bit lower than what they think the actual price is			0
betting $ 1 more takes advantage of this			1
clean their clock the game -- clock game : guess the exact price of two prizes in less than 30 seconds			0
on a wrong guess , the host will tell you if you need to guess higher or lower			0
the tip : assume both prizes are worth between $ 500 and $ 1,000 then cut the difference in half and repeat			0
according to @entity6 's analysis based on more than 75 games , this strategy works 100 % of the time			1
why it works : splitting the difference each time is the fastest way to home in on the correct price ( it 's technically called a ' binary search ' ) and should keep the times you have to guess on each prize below 10			0
since you get unlimited guesses , you just need to be quick about each guess and victory is yours ! stop the yodeling the game -- @entity112 : known to most of us as " the yodeling game , " players guess the two - digit price of three items			1
a mountain climbing figure clad in lederhosen makes his way one step closer to the top of a mountain for every dollar your guess is from the actual price			0
if he travels over 25 steps ( if your guesses total more than $ 25 off ) then he falls and you lose			0
the tip : guess $ 19 the first time , and then guess $ 11 more than the price of the previous item on your second and third guesses			2
why it works : @entity6 's research found that each prize is slightly more expensive than the prize before it , so the step up of $ 11 is in the sweet spot to compensate for the increase			1
based on over 50 games , this strategy worked 100 % of the time			0
the @entity150 the game -- magic number : the contestant is shown two prizes and has to guess a number that is between the prices of the two prizes			0
the tip : guess $ 2,250			0
why it works : because of math. @entity6 crunched all the numbers from over 50 plays of @entity163 , and found that guessing $ 2,250 would win 79 % of the time			1
the average contestant only won 44 % of the time			0
@entity6 's article outlines some more strategies ( including another game where he found a strategy that works 100 % of the time ) and includes a " @entity175 " cheat sheet that 's so complete , it even earned a retweet from @entity173 , the show 's host			1
@entity176 will celebrate 90th birthday on ' @entity175 '			2

@entity16 staff writer @entity6 crunched the numbers to find ways to win on " @entity175 "
on @entity49 's row , use the $ 1 higher strategy , he says
on @entity112 , also known to most of us as " the yodeling game , " go with 19 and add 11
