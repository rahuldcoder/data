-- in less than a month , pastor @entity1 of the @entity2 in @entity3 plans to host " @entity6 " to mark the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks			1
the pastor , author of the book " @entity15 is of the @entity16 , " is using the burning to urge @entity11 @entity10 to " stand up " to what he describes as a monolithic @entity14 threat			1
a facebook page for the event has accrued thousands of " likes " and @entity1 has said people have been mailing him @entity21 to burn			0
as a @entity14 scholar , an adherent of one of the @entity26 faiths -- @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity15 -- and as someone committed to interfaith understanding , i urge @entity1 to cancel this event			1
not only are the actions of @entity1 contrary to the life and teachings of @entity35 , but they are also against the ideals of the @entity37			0
the planned burning has already caused alarm in the @entity14 world , with the pre-eminent @entity42 university , @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , condemning it as " stirring up hate and discrimination			1
" at a recent dinner in @entity50 , a host for one of @entity48 's top tv channels confided in me that he " did n't dare " report the story because if he did , " not a single @entity11 would be safe in @entity48			2
" he and the cameraman were quivering with anger as they asked me to explain why @entity11 hated @entity15			2
i tried my best to explain this was not the case , but @entity1 ' burning will have great symbolic significance to a @entity14 world already feeling under attack by the @entity11			1
it will cause undue harm to @entity11 relations with the @entity14 world and particularly the war effort			1
gen. @entity72 , the head of @entity11 forces in @entity75 , has repeatedly expressed the need for winning the " hearts and minds " of local people by treating them with dignity and respect			2
when @entity75 see that their holy book is being burned , it will cause riots and attacks that will put @entity11 troops further at risk			1
there will be similar riots and attacks in neighboring @entity48 and @entity91			0
it will inflame the entire @entity14 world and fuel acts of terrorism			1
it could also inflame anti-muslim sentiment in the @entity11 , especially in the context of the anger over the proposed @entity15 center near ground zero in @entity102			1
many @entity11 @entity14 will feel as if they are second - class citizens and it could push some angry young men toward violence			1
on my recent fieldwork trip to 100 mosques in 75 @entity11 cities with a team of @entity11 researchers for the book " @entity113 : the @entity116 , " we documented that many mosques had been attacked , sometimes bombed			2
in may , not far from @entity1 ' church in @entity119 , a pipe bomb exploded in a mosque in @entity121			0
as objectionable as the prospect of @entity1 ' quran burning is , it may not cease with the holy book of the @entity14			1
i have always maintained that this kind of vitriolic hatred of one religion is a descent on a slippery slope , as no one can say who will be next			0
i was not surprised , therefore , when i heard @entity1 recently agree , when asked to do so in an internet podcast interview , to burn " a couple of copies of the @entity136 " too			0
not only does the burning of holy texts reflect the darkest days of medieval @entity139 and @entity140 , but it is hard to think of anything more un-american , by the definition of the @entity144 themselves			1
@entity146 welcomed the @entity147 to @entity11 as the " stock of @entity149 " while @entity150 showed the utmost respect for @entity15 , naming the @entity152 as one of the greatest truth seekers in history			2
@entity156 called him a model of compassion			0
the @entity144 read and honored the same @entity159 that @entity1 is now seeking to burn			2
@entity160 kept the same @entity159 in his personal collection and it informed his decision to host the first presidential iftaar during @entity164			0
the @entity144 were also inspired by @entity10 thinkers like @entity166 , who declared that the true @entity10 's duty was to " practice charity , meekness , and good - will in general toward all mankind , even to those that are not @entity10			0
" i consulted many distinguished @entity26 friends for this article , all concerned with the drift toward intolerance exemplified by @entity1 ' threat , who were happy to endorse this article 's content and language			0
they include the @entity184 bishop of @entity50 , the right rev. @entity185 ; senior rabbi @entity186 of the @entity187 ; @entity188 , executive director of the @entity189 in @entity190 ; pastor dr. @entity191 of @entity192 , @entity3 's , @entity193 and member of the @entity195 ; the rev. @entity196 of the @entity197 , the rev. dr. @entity198 of the @entity199 ; sister @entity200 , sister of @entity202 and host of @entity204 , and too many others to name			0
at the core of the @entity26 faiths , these esteemed figures represent the need to show compassion and understanding of others			0
by threatening to burn the holy books of two of these faiths , the @entity159 and the @entity136 , @entity1 is violating the basic tenants of all the @entity26 faiths and doing something that is unacceptable by any standard of religion			0
as an adherent of one of these faiths , @entity15 , and one who respects the other faiths , i implore @entity1 as a @entity10 and an @entity11 to cancel his burning event , follow the true teachings of @entity35 by loving his neighbor , and engage in respectful dialogue instead			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			0
