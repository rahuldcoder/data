@entity3 ' resignation was not linked to the september attack that killed four @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , and he never passed classified information to the woman he was having an affair with , the former @entity1 director told an @entity12 journalist			1
" in our first conversation , " @entity13 , from @entity14 's sister network @entity12 , said thursday , @entity3 " had told me he had engaged in something dishonorable			2
he sought to do the honorable thing in response -- and that was to come forward			0
he was very clear that he screwed up terribly ... even felt fortunate to have a wife who is far better than he deserves			0
" @entity13 , who has interviewed @entity3 in war zones , initially reached out to him to express shock at the news of the affair that derailed a highly decorated career in the military and @entity1			1
among other things , @entity3 said he has not talked with @entity30 , his biographer and the woman with whom he had an affair , since the scandal broke			1
what the @entity3 scandal says about digital spying and your e-mail " he insisted to me that he has never passed classified information to @entity30 , " @entity13 said			2
" he said this has nothing to do with @entity6 , and he wants to testify			0
" @entity3 is expected to appear friday before the @entity44 and @entity45 intelligence committees , aiming to clear up " a lot of misrepresentations of what he told @entity50 initially " about who was behind the attack , a source who has spoken with him said			1
meanwhile , the " general conduct " of @entity3 is the focus of a new investigation launched by the @entity1 's inspector general , said @entity1 spokesman @entity55 said			1
among other aspects , this inquiry will explore whether @entity3 used @entity1 resources in carrying out his affair with @entity30 , a @entity5 official said			1
in his first public comments on the matter , attorney general @entity65 said thursday that @entity69 officials did not tell the @entity44 about related @entity71 investigations -- including looking into possible breaches of top - secret information -- because it was determined national security was never at risk			1
" had we made the determination that a threat to national security existed , we would of course have made that known to the president and appropriate members on ( @entity85 ) @entity84 , " @entity65 told reporters in @entity81			1
" but as we went through the investigation ... we felt very secure in the knowledge that a national security threat did not exist			1
" the former @entity1 chief did n't try to persuade his bosses to let him keep his job once he admitted the affair , and " has maintained to me all along this was a personal failing , " @entity13 said			1
the extramarital relationship ended months ago			0
but it continues to make waves in @entity98 , as suspicions ripple through the capital about the timing of its revelation and @entity3 ' scheduled testimony into the @entity6 attack			2
top @entity5 general caught up in scandal in addition , the chain of fiery e-mails that led the @entity71 to discover the sexual indiscretion has caused collateral damage , putting the imminent nomination of gen. @entity114 as @entity116 commander on hold , until the nature of his e-mail exchange and relationship with a military " socialite " have been clarified			1
the @entity71 investigation was triggered by @entity124 , a veteran agent for the @entity126 @entity71 field office , who is a friend of @entity127 , said @entity128 , general counsel for the @entity129			2
the tricky nature of investigating gen. @entity114 's e-mails @entity127 , who was a volunteer at @entity133 in @entity134 , contacted @entity124 about anonymous e-mails that questioned her character , a @entity5 official and a source close to @entity127 said			1
@entity124 took the information on the e-mails to the " appropriate components , " @entity139 said			0
" he reported it to the proper channels and had no further part in the case			0
" asked about reports that @entity124 pestered the agents assigned to the case for information , @entity139 said that was n't true			0
" i do n't accept that			0
he followed proper protocols , " he said			0
however , the @entity71 is reviewing @entity124 ' actions , a law enforcement official said			2
the agency will look at whether @entity124 followed proper procedures in speaking to some members of @entity50 about his concerns about how the @entity71 was handling @entity127 's case			2
the review will include a look at whether the agent went through the proper chain of command at the @entity71 to raise his concerns , the official said			2
@entity124 is still on duty in the @entity126 office			0
reports by officials familiar with the e-mail messages between @entity127 and @entity114 give conflicting impressions about their potentially inappropriate nature -- with one @entity5 official saying " @entity114 would be very embarrassed by them " and a senior official close to the general saying they do n't point to a sexual or romantic relationship			1
that @entity114 remains in command in @entity183 suggests that there is no criminal issue , a @entity5 official told @entity14			1
but the official said the @entity187 's inspector general could still find evidence of criminal conduct			2
the investigation into the e-mails connected to @entity114 and @entity127 led to the discovery of the affair between @entity3 , 60 , and @entity30 , 40			1
the fallout has been widespread , but there are signs that the @entity71 investigation is winding down , said @entity14 contributor @entity198 , a former @entity71 assistant director			2
there is no indication of criminal activity on the part of @entity3 or that he disclosed classified information , senior federal law enforcement officials told @entity198			2
@entity207 ' financial troubles @entity127 hosted top military brass at her home , but it 's unclear if @entity114 or @entity3 were aware that her family was experiencing financial difficulties or of the unusual background of a charity they founded			1
public records show that in april 2010 , about six years after the @entity207 bought their $ 1.5 million home , @entity218 filed to foreclose on the property , saying the couple had n't made a mortgage payment since september 2009			0
@entity134 records show there are at least nine lawsuits involving money and the @entity127 family , including unpaid credit card bills of more than $ 320,000			0
public records also show the @entity207 founded a cancer research charity in 2005 called the doctor @entity230			0
in a 2008 federal tax return , the @entity207 ' charity reported it spent the exact amount of money it raised : $ 157,000			0
the charity 's money paid for parties , transportation , legal bills and other administrative costs			0
there is no evidence any of the money was used for cancer research or caring for cancer patients			0
asked for the @entity207 ' side of the story , a source close to the family told @entity14 the source did n't have enough information to respond			2
@entity30 's security clearance it appears unlikely that @entity30 would face prosecution in the case , a senior law enforcement official said			1
officials continued to review materials taken from her home , and the @entity71 needed a presumption that there were classified materials there when they obtained a search warrant			0
but it appears that any violations of releasing classified information appear not to be egregious			0
before the warrant was issued , @entity71 agents approached high - level @entity187 officials to ask them if material they had tied to @entity30 could be considered classified , two @entity5 officials with direct knowledge of the case said			1
@entity187 officials said they were classified			0
as a military reservist , @entity30 had security clearance but presumably would have no clear reason to have classified information in her home , the officials said			1
the military has many safeguards in place , including not allowing data to be saved on hard drives and restricting what can be sent out by e-mail , to prevent secret info from getting out			0
@entity30 's security clearance with the government has since been suspended , pending the outcome of the investigation , said the officials			1
the relevance of @entity30 's security clearance @entity3 reportedly has not been following the media firestorm over the extramarital affair that led to his resignation			1
" he wants to maintain a distance and focus on his family at this time , " his aide , retired col. @entity301 , has said			0
the affair with @entity30 ended about four months ago , @entity301 said , though the two remained in contact afterward , as she needed his help to finish her dissertation			0
