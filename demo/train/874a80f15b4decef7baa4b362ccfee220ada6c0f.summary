join the @entity0 @entity33 @entity13 's career flowed through the pencil of @entity36 , whose vibrant illustrations captivated a generation of youngsters			2
the @entity41 star was known by different names across @entity43 -- @entity44 in the @entity45 , @entity46 in @entity47 -- but he was always brought to life by the hand of @entity36 , who died in april 1999			2
@entity36 , while also working on other make - believe sporting heroes , spent time working on @entity51 's favorite young adventurer @entity3 during the 1950s			0
" with @entity52 , @entity36 created this character in 1973 with a football player named @entity55 , " football agent and @entity59 enthusiast @entity57 told @entity0			1
" he played in a company football team , not as a professional , in @entity61 , @entity47			2
" the @entity45 comic magazine @entity63 ordered @entity36 to create a comic about football to be published in 1974 , the same year @entity47 hosted the @entity66			1
" characters such as @entity13 have always been a staple for football fans throughout the years			2
@entity71 youngsters were held in thrall by the trials and tribulations of @entity75 , the eponymous hero of the " @entity80 " series who dazzled during decades with the fictional @entity79 club			0
@entity13 's career began in 1979 , the year the real @entity6 team lifted the @entity83 , and his story was told across 15 albums running until 1992 -- the year the @entity86 became champions of @entity43 for the first time			1
" nothing sounds better for a younger @entity6 supporter than a comic hero who wears the shirt of his team and lives so many adventures , " says filmmaker @entity89 , who is hoping to produce a documentary about @entity91			1
" on the other hand , as seen in the comics , the drawing style of @entity36 is very realistic and is very well documented			0

for me , as well as for many fans of @entity104 , it was very exciting and special to see your city and your football club drawn as well in a comic			0
" while his exploits on the pitch excited readers , it was @entity13 's friendship with a group of young boys which was central to his appeal			2

" @entity91 trains with the guys in the middle of the street but they do n't know that he is the new star of @entity6			2
" @entity36 's portrayal of the relationship between @entity13 and @entity128 and his friends , the " @entity134 " , allowed every young child to imagine what it would be like to befriend a soccer superstar			2

a child can dream to live events like the ' @entity143 ' did			0
" true cule as with all good stories , @entity13 's career took a sudden twist in 1984 when the goalscorer signed for @entity7			1
" as a @entity41 citizen , i was happy to see him at a @entity41 club , " says @entity57			0
" that was a big success for the @entity41 championship and also the possibility to see @entity41 stadiums and teams			0
" on the other hand , this move was a little disappointing			0
everybody wondered , could his relationship with the ' @entity134 ' continue ? " @entity13 's transfer came back to haunt the fictional @entity6 team in edition eight after he powered @entity7 to victory in the @entity163 , a made up @entity9 competition , beating the @entity86 club in the final			1
the character had never won the @entity163 with @entity6 and now he had extinguished his former club 's hopes			0
" the whole affair led to outrage among followers of the series , who were devastated by @entity36 and @entity177 ' decision to transfer @entity13 to @entity7 , " said @entity6 's official website			1
" not only that , but to also have him participate in the defeat of @entity6 in the most important club competition in @entity43			0
" having spent issues eight and nine in the @entity41 capital , and after @entity6 lowered their financial demands , @entity13 made an emotional return to the @entity86 club			1
his comeback was the stuff of dreams for young @entity6 and @entity91 fans			0
in 1988 , four years after leaving the @entity11 , @entity13 finally fired the club to @entity163 success			0
" i liked so much the moment when @entity6 wins the final of @entity163 with a penalty from @entity13 in the 12th album 12 , " says @entity89			1
" in the 1980s @entity6 had never won the @entity25			1
it was a great time to be a @entity6 supporter			0

" @entity13 quickly became an idol for many young readers in the ' 80s , all over the world			0
" in reality @entity6 and @entity7 are both attempting to conquer @entity43 , with wednesday 's second leg tie in @entity6 delicately poised after the first leg in @entity212 finished 2 - 2			1
