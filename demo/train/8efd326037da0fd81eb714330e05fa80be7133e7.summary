@entity0 -- allegations that @entity5 hackers infiltrated the computers of two leading @entity8 newspapers add to a growing number of cyber attacks on @entity12 companies , governments and foreign - based dissidents that are believed to originate in @entity5 , experts say			1
according to one recent report , one in every three observed computer attacks in the third quarter of 2012 emanated from @entity5			1
@entity5 officials have denied that @entity20 has supported any cyber attacks , stressing that hacking is illegal in the country			1
the @entity24 reported wednesday it had been the target of four months of cyber assaults , which started during an investigation by the newspaper into the wealth reportedly accumulated by relatives of the @entity5 premier , @entity32			1
the @entity33 said thursday that its computer systems also had been infiltrated by @entity5 hackers			1
cyber security experts say the alleged attack on the @entity24 appeared to be similar to previously reported attacks that were linked to @entity5			1
" to do a spear - phishing attack of this kind is a well - established move in attacks against @entity46 and various @entity8 defense contractors from @entity5 , " said @entity38 , a former employee of the @entity39 who now advises foreign firms in @entity5 on computer security			1
@entity24 attack a wake - up call , security experts say " you could say the tools are sort of stock - in - trade " for @entity5 hackers , he said			1
" @entity64 " is a technique of disguising an email so that it appears to be from a trusted source , luring the victim to open an attachment or link that unleashes malicious software on the computer			0
investigators for the @entity24 say they suspect the technique was used by the hackers to break into the newspaper 's system where they were able collect passwords of every @entity24 employee and gain access to the personal computers of 53 employees			2
security experts who helped the newspaper to counter the attacks accumulated evidence that the hackers used methods " associated with the @entity5 military in the past " to breach the network , the @entity24 said			1
@entity5 denials asked about the @entity24 's allegations on thursday , a spokesman for the @entity84 said that " all such alleged attacks are groundless , irresponsible accusations lacking solid proof or reliable research results			1
" @entity5 has been the victim of cyberattacks and " has laws and regulations prohibiting such actions , " the spokesman , @entity92 , said at a regular news briefing			2
a separate statement from the @entity98 said the country 's military " has never supported any hacker activities			0
" but data reported by @entity12 companies suggest that even though @entity5 authorities say they prohibit hacking , they are struggling to keep it under control			1
one - third of all observed computer attacks from july through september last year came from @entity5 , according to a report last month from @entity110 , an internet services company			1
the @entity8 was a distant second , originating 13 % of observed attacks , followed by @entity113 with 4.7 %			2
" @entity5 has been consistently responsible for the largest percentage of observed attacks since ( the fourth quarter of ) 2011 , " the report said			1
the most recent report shows a dramatic upswing in incidents from the @entity122 country			2
in the second quarter , 16 % of observed cyber attacks came from @entity5 , the company said			1
the executive summary of the report did n't specify from which groups or individuals in @entity5 the attacks might have come			2
@entity46 had a very public spat with the @entity5 government in 2010 after it claimed @entity5 had led a hacking attack against @entity46 , other technology companies , defense corporations and @entity5 dissidents			2
" in the past they 've been pretty much focused on either intellectual properties , such as the hacking of defense companies , or dissidents they want to get at , like the @entity142 attacks , " @entity38 said			2
" in this case , it appears they were trying to be able to get to people who talked to the @entity24 -- they could make their lives miserable and send the message : do n't do this			0
" they love to instill fear so people self censor or limit what they would say or do with the media , " he added			0
compromised computers @entity159 , the security firm that led the investigation at the @entity24 , says there is good reason for concern in the @entity8			0
" there are thousands of computers compromising the @entity8 at universities , at @entity170 shops -- small organizations without a big cyber security program -- and those computers serve as the beachhead to hack blue - chip @entity8 companies , " @entity165 , the chief executive of @entity159 , told @entity1			0
" the majority of victims , well over 90 % of the victims we have responded to , really do n't disclose that these attacks occur " for fear of losing customer trust , @entity165 said			0
" the folks that perpetrated this intrusion have done it to hundreds of other organizations and usually they are very successful , " @entity165 said			0
" what 's really unique here is the fact that the victim organization , the @entity24 , has decided to share this information with the public , so people can be more aware of the problem -- because it 's a very pervasive problem			0
" @entity198 , chief information officer of @entity199 , told @entity1 that the newspaper believed it had prevented this attack from revealing confidential sources			0
in the case of the investigation into @entity32 's family 's finances , much of the information came from public records			0
but @entity198 said @entity199 is n't letting its guard down after expelling the hackers			0
" i think we 're over this phase of the attack and obviously the types of things they tried to do previously they 'll have a more difficult time doing , but this is n't over , " he said			0
" as long as there are computers and networks we 're going to be faced with cyber espionage threats			0
" @entity1 's @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity1 's @entity20 bureau contributed to this report			0

report : one in every three observed computer attacks in @entity230 came from @entity5
the @entity24 and the @entity33 claim to be victims of @entity5 attacks
@entity5 officials say there are no state - sponsored hacking attacks on @entity12 companies
experts say the number of attacks coming out of @entity5 has risen in recent years
