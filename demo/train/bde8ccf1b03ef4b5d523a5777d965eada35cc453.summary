-- just as the politics of oil shaped the 20th century industrial economy , so the politics of data will shape the 21st century digital economy			1
at this week 's @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , a prestigious technology conference held annually in @entity12 , the fault lines of the political debate about data were exposed by the event 's two keynote speakers : the @entity16 's vice president for justice , @entity18 , and @entity20 's chief operating officer , @entity21			1
reding and @entity21 were in agreement about one thing : personal data is the new oil , the vital fuel of our digital economy			1
but that 's about all they agreed on at @entity10			2
in every other respect , their priorities and agendas represent the bookends of an increasingly fractious debate that is pitting @entity38 politicians like @entity18 against @entity40 social media networks such as @entity21 's @entity20			1
@entity18 's focus is on the consumer 's control of their own data			1
" personal data is the currency of today 's digital market			1
and like any currency , it needs stability and trust , " @entity18 argued in the opening keynote of the conference			2
that " stability " and " trust " , she believes , can only be won by legislating in favor of consumers ' ability to protect their personal data			2
the great threat to individual liberty in the digital age , @entity18 argued at @entity10 , comes from companies that use our data to enrich themselves -- buying and selling our most intimate details for their own corporate benefit			1
individual privacy in today 's networked age , she argued , can only be protected by tighter legislation on what companies can do with our data and by more aggressive data - protection officers and agencies			1
to this end , @entity18 is introducing legislation which will give consumers the right to be forgotten on online social networks like @entity20 and @entity81			1
" the journey has only just begun " , @entity21 told the @entity10 audience in the final speech of the event			0
but this is a journey -- of a data revolution driven by powerful social networks like @entity20 -- that @entity21 , in contrast with @entity18 , relishes			1
what we do online is increasingly who we are , she said			0
" we are our real identities online			0
" rather than wanting to be forgotten , @entity21 believes that we all want to be remembered			0
all this personal data empowers us , @entity20 's second most powerful executive insisted			1
it represents a shift to what she called " authentic identity , " from the wisdom of the crowd to " wisdom of our friends			0
" above all , she said , it turns all of us from being passive receivers of other people 's information into active broadcasters of our own lives			2
the digital data revolution is " a really big deal , " @entity21 insisted at @entity10			1
it represents a profound shift in the balance of power between institutions and individuals			0
the sharing of information reshapes our lives ; it brings us together and empowers us			0
and it makes us richer too , she argued , suggesting that @entity20 alone had created 230,000 jobs and is even committed to giving 50,000 @entity38 small businesses â ‚ ¬ 100 euros ( $ 130 ) apiece to develop their social identities			1
@entity18 and @entity21 's presentations represented the first and last speeches of the three day event			2
but their speeches were separated by more than just 72 hours			0
there 's a gulf , perhaps even an inseparable chasm , between the two women 's assumptions about both the value and role of personal data in our increasingly digital society			1
i 'm not sure if @entity21 is correct to argue that the digital journey of the 21st century is only just beginning			0
but i am pretty certain that this debate about the politics of data will run and run in a world in which personal data is increasingly the oil powering our digitally connected economy			2
internet : an engine of progress or hate ? there was much talk at @entity10 about the internet representing a historic shift of power -- from the nation - state to the 21st century empowered individual			1
from @entity172 , @entity40 secretary of state @entity165 's special advisor on innovation , to @entity167 , @entity81 's head of global innovation , and to @entity171 co-founder @entity170 , the @entity10 core message was that the internet represented a vehicle of democratic progress and global toleration			1
the @entity10 message of openness and toleration was also reflected in the event itself			0
hosted by the @entity12 - based publishing mogul @entity181 and the legendary @entity183 networker @entity182 , @entity10 brought together peoples from all over the world and included speakers from @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity190 as well as from @entity38 and the @entity40			2
the speakers ' dinner was even held in the @entity193 of @entity12 's @entity194 , a building distinguished by both its spacious architecture and its wonderful acoustics			0
so it was particularly ironic that the @entity200 parliament released a report earlier this week showing that @entity202 remained " deeply rooted " in @entity200 society and that the @entity153 is playing a central role in spreading the unspeakable lie of @entity207 denial			1
blaming the internet for @entity202 is , of course , like blaming printing press inventor @entity210 for @entity213 's @entity212			2
and yet it 's hard to avoid concluding that the @entity153 is n't quite the engine of progress that @entity21 , @entity172 or @entity217 believe it is			1
nor is it the den of pure iniquity that critics like myself have sometimes argued			0
turn on , log on , drop out neither @entity223 nor fellow @entity20 founder @entity224 were at @entity10 , so it was left to @entity227 's ceo @entity226 to wow of this year 's conference with his youthful exuberance			1
his speech , with its acknowledgment that @entity227 was " an accidental social network " whose remarkable success has been built on what he calls the network 's " curators , " was one of the most admired of the event			0
i had dinner with @entity226 and found him to be a disarmingly impressive young man			0
a @entity242 high school dropout who never attended college , lived for a while in @entity189 , and started his first company in his teens , @entity226 has that entrepreneurial quality of being both refreshingly humble and yet uncannily poised			0
with @entity81 creator @entity248 , he is a good bet to inherit @entity223 's mantle of the world 's most charismatic young start - up entrepreneur			0
@entity226 also joins that pantheon of start - up entrepreneurs -- from @entity255 and @entity256 to @entity223 -- who have dropped out of school to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams			0
traditional education is failing to stimulate remarkably innovative young men like @entity226			0
perhaps @entity264 co-founder @entity263 is right			0
we really should be paying unusually talented kids like @entity226 to drop out of college			0
