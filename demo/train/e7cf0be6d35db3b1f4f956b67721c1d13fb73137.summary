-- there 's a coming showdown between @entity3 and @entity4 on the issue of income inequality			1
president @entity7 has called it the " defining issue of our time			2
" progressives recognize that sustaining unemployment benefits , increasing the minimum wage and ensuring equal pay are key weapons			2
republicans , who recently voted to leave 1.3 million @entity17 in the cold by not extending unemployment benefits , frame the inequality debate as yet another attempt to implement liberal , anti-free market , big - government giveaways			1
in a speech last week , @entity4 presidential hopeful @entity24 said federal money should be given to the states to figure out how to deal with poverty			1
he called for replacing the @entity29 with a subsidy to encourage people to take low - wage jobs , and for the federal government to encourage marriage			0
he called president @entity35 's @entity36 a failure			1
but there is no question that without the @entity36 , millions more would be in it today			1
attempts to paint it any other way will backfire , as majorities of @entity17 support its policies			1
@entity4 have a chance to show they are on the side of the @entity17 people in addressing poverty and inequality			1
@entity17 's women and children , in particular , are depending on them			1
in fact , 50 years after @entity35 declared war on poverty , an astonishing new report by @entity56 paints a bleak picture of today 's barren economic landscape for 42 million women and 28 million children			1
@entity56 's father , @entity61 , helped lead the @entity35 administration 's all - out campaign on behalf of the elderly , the hungry and vulnerable families and children			1
while facts show that without this effort many more @entity17 would be in poverty today , @entity56 's report , " a woman 's @entity72 , " describes a much - changed nation in which poverty wears a different face			1
on the one hand , it is indisputable that women have made much progress			2
a majority of women are now family breadwinners , and they hold more college degrees than men			2
women have also made gains in reaching the highest levels in business and politics			2
but these benchmarks mask a disturbing reality : too many women are one missed paycheck , one illness , one hospital visit or car breakdown away from economic disaster			2
a recent best - seller urged career women to " lean in " to succeed in the workplace			1
the @entity56 report underscores how many women lie awake at night worrying that they could fall out of the middle or working class and into the ranks of the poor			2
while many of us are pondering how to have it all , these strong women are doing it all , without having much			0
shamefully , the richest country in the world does not invest enough to allow women to keep fueling @entity17 's economic growth while securing their own economic futures and those of their children			1
the report lists many reasons for this predicament -- the lack of well - paying jobs that offer upward mobility ; the change in the family structure where majorities of low - income women , many of them single , are heads of households ; and most importantly , the lack of good education			0
those are the overarching realities , but there are many more subtle , hidden aspects of the economic landscape for women in @entity17			1
one - third live in or on the brink of poverty			0
they struggle to get their children to school at 7 for breakfast , so they can take their mothers to medical appointments and still make it to work by 9			0
forty - two million women represent two - thirds of minimum - wage workers in the country , and women still make just 77 % of what men make			0
so what can be done ? for starters , we can fix the wage discrepancy between men and women			0
this could cut the poverty rate in half for struggling working women and it would represent an economic stimulus of half a trillion dollars			0
the @entity56 report also outlines a set of other public policy solutions , including raising the minimum wage for all and helping women access better paying jobs through job training			0
it describes how government support structures could allow for better and more affordable child care , enabling women to balance the roles of caregiver and breadwinner			1
and in a surprising revelation , it uncovers the regret many of these low - income women express about marrying early -- and also , in many cases , their satisfaction at having gotten divorced			0
@entity4 lectures about marriage and family values will not work to solve poverty			1
but making education and child care accessible , closing the wage gap and leveling the playing field will			0
republicans should note that one of the studies in the @entity56 report shows that women of color -- a key demographic with whom the party desperately needs to make inroads -- overwhelmingly believe government has a role to play in providing adaptive workplace structures and policies that support today 's contemporary families			1
no , this is not a plea for a handout			0
these women , while in a more financially precarious position than their white counterparts , are also more optimistic about their futures			0
as in : i want to work hard and know there are better economic opportunities out there for me to succeed			0
these policy solutions the report offers are not new ; progressives have been fighting for them for a very long time			0
but it also outlines what we can do as individuals , communities and corporations			0
we can , for example , help young girls make smarter choices , promote a " college before kids " mentality , and help businesses identify best practice policies that can better support low - wage women workers			1
so let 's forgo the showdown			0
these are common - sense proposals that uphold mainstream principles of taking care of our families and children			0
they are not liberal , progressive or @entity3 values			0
they are @entity17 values that will protect and secure the @entity17 dream for everyone once and for all			2
@entity17 expect our leaders from both parties to uphold them			1
let 's get to work			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			2

@entity259 : in parties ' inequality debate , @entity4 has chance to show it gets it
she says economy 's failure to help @entity17 seen clearly in the lot of women , children
she says women need equal wages , workplace policies that support women
@entity259 : @entity24 , @entity4 slam @entity36 policies ; issue needs attention , not partisanship
