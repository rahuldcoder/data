-- @entity2 's first - half double saw @entity3 through to the final of @entity5 as they stunned @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity7 were hot favorites going into this semifinal but @entity2 struck twice before halftime and @entity7 were unable to claw their way back			1
@entity14 pulled a goal back from the penalty spot in injury time , but @entity3 deservedly held on to set up a final against @entity19 on sunday			1
the win continues @entity3 's remarkable record in major tournaments against @entity7 , who have failed to beat the @entity24 in eight attempts			1
this emerging young @entity27 side were tipped by many to go all the way at this tournament , but their burgeoning progress was checked by a clinical @entity3 team			0
@entity7 started the match as expected and the @entity24 were lucky to survive a couple of early wobbles by their goalkeeper @entity36			0
the @entity3 captain was caught in no - man 's land early on , allowing @entity39 to poke goalwards only to see @entity40 scramble the ball off the line			2
minutes later , @entity36 pushed out a @entity44 cross and was relieved to see the loose ball bounce off his own defender , @entity46 , and behind for a corner			0
but midway through the first half it was @entity3 who made the breakthrough with a quite brilliantly worked goal			0
@entity7 stood off @entity40 , allowing the @entity3 playmaker to sweep a pass out to @entity55 who fed @entity56			1
@entity56 superbly spun away from two defenders and swept in an inviting cross that allowed @entity2 to drift away from @entity59 and head home from close range			0
sixteen minutes later , the @entity24 remarkably doubled their lead with a sweeping counterattack following a @entity7 corner			0
@entity3 left two strikers forward and the tactic paid off as @entity67 swept a long ball over the head of @entity70 , allowing @entity2 to chest the ball down and run clear before smashing an unstoppable shot beyond a stunned @entity73			2
the first - half double saw the young @entity76 striker double his international goal tally -- having scored just once coming in to @entity5 @entity2 is now the tournament 's joint leading goalscorer on three			1
@entity7 needed a response in the second half and they got it in effort , but not in goals			2
a smart one - two on the edge of the area between @entity70 and @entity86 ended with @entity70 sidefooting over when he should have hit the target			0
a goal then would have ensured a fascinating second half , but @entity3 looked just as likely to score again as @entity7 increasingly gambled at the back			1
@entity2 curled a shot across the face of goal before limping off with cramp and @entity95 twice drilled wide from inviting positions as @entity3 failed to kill off the @entity27 threat			2
substitute @entity98 wasted another golden chance eight minutes from time when he ran clear but fired into the side netting , but at the other end @entity3 's defending was outstanding			0
that resilience was emphatically underlined by @entity104 's goalsaving tackle to keep out substitute @entity106 late on , although @entity104 's handball in stoppage time did give @entity14 the chance to score from the spot			0
that came too late to save @entity7 though and @entity3 now face a @entity19 side who they held 1 - 1 in the group stages earlier in this tournament .			1

@entity2 scores both goals as @entity3 beat @entity7 2 - 1
@entity2 scores twice in first - half to set - up sunday final with @entity19
@entity76 striker now joint leading goalscorer at @entity5
@entity14 scores late penalty for @entity7
