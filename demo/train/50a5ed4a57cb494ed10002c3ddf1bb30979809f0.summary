-- three more @entity2 based airlines have announced plans to ban shark 's fin cargo from their flights			1
@entity8 's national carrier and @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity11 are the latest to promise to halt shipments of shark fin and shark - related products from unsustainable and unverified sources			1
acting ceo of @entity18 -- soon to rebrand as @entity18 -- says the move is the result of a month - long review of its freight policies relating to shark products			1
" we believe a ban on the shipment of unsustainably sourced shark fins is the right thing to do , and have implemented this policy effective immediately , " @entity25 said in a statement released monday			2
" we will now work with conservation partners and the fishing industry to prepare and implement policies and processes that will ensure future shipments are sustainably sourced			0
" shark finning thrives on @entity40 rooftops @entity11 made its announcement of the change in policy last week			1
" previously , @entity11 carried shark fin only under the condition that a valid @entity48 ( convention on @entity50 and @entity51 ) permit was fully obtained by the customer from the related national management authority , " the airline said in a statement			1
" however , recently there has been a series of global movements calling to ban the carriage of shark fins			2
in view of these movements and in order to support the global call of protecting endangered shark species , @entity11 has recently reviewed its policy to stop the carriage of shark fins			2
" @entity65 , a spokesman from @entity11 rival @entity9 , told @entity0 the airline has already banned shark fins from its flights as well			1
success for anti-shark fin campaigns the announcement by @entity18 -- which in two days will officially relaunch as @entity18 -- comes in the wake of criticism of its earlier shark fin shipments to @entity40 , the world 's biggest market for the controversial product			1
campaigns highlighting the cruelty and devastation stemming from the practice continue to gather pace in the region			0
approximately 72 million sharks are killed each year and 10,000 tons of fins are traded through @entity40			1
@entity86 bans shark 's fin cargo flights " bans such as the ones taken by the airlines are an important step in the right direction , " @entity89 , director of @entity40 - based @entity90 , told @entity0			1
" the supply chain of shark products involves many players and the chances are good that traders will move to other carriers			0
but each disruption adds inefficiency and added cost to the transport , hopefully adding strong pressure to end the trade			0
" prominent hotels and restaurants in the city have been publicly striking shark fin from their menus , while @entity40 's main carrier @entity86 also announced a ban on shark 's fin cargo last september			1
@entity90 's @entity89 says the impact of these large companies stepping up to ban shark fin is huge			1
" when hotels like the @entity122 or airlines like @entity86 take a stand to do what 's right , it sends a message that being socially responsible is good business , " he says			0
" it also means these organizations who reach millions of customers every year can be major contributors for doing good			0
moreover , it validates what the grassroots groups have been saying all along			0
" last month , @entity135 also agreed to stop flying shipments of shark fin to @entity40			1
the decision came about after the @entity139 revealed the airline 's shipments in local media			0
" @entity135 has taken the decision to suspend the carriage of shark fins while we undertake a review of the issue , " @entity135 spokesperson @entity143 told @entity0 last month			2
though such bans prove that the issue is taking root not just at the dinner table but also in boardrooms , more governments in @entity2 need to follow suit says @entity157 , director and co-founder of the @entity159			0
" @entity161 ' attitudes are shifting against consuming shark products and many states have banned it including @entity164 , " he tells @entity0			0
" @entity2 's governments need to step up and echo the attitudes of their populace			0
@entity40 plays a crucial role in this , as it accounts for a little over 50 % of the global trade			2
but so far @entity40 has n't even followed @entity172 in banning it at government banquets			2
" @entity175 group bans shark 's fin from menus @entity0 's @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
