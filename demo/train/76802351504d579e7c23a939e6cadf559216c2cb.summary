@entity0 -- imagine a world where computing becomes invisible , like your thoughts			1
a world where the interface between our senses , our minds and brains , and a digital device that emulates human traits or which augments our own capabilities becomes seamless , and the border between " it " and " us " becomes opaque			1
imagine instant access to the world 's data and content , without typing or without even searching -- think @entity22 x100 , projected onto your iris			1
the power of @entity27 's @entity26 at the disposal of every doctor , with a blink of an eye or a simple voice command			0
anticipatory services that know what you need before you do			0
@entity36 reads of my body 's status via my wristwatch			0
vast progress and vast curses " nothing vast enters the lives of mortals without a curse " @entity44 tragedian sophocles once said			0
and plenty of curses are sure to emerge when it 's about wearables , which are powered by big data , the cloud , artificial intelligence , not to forget good old - fashioned capitalism			0
it is the danger of exponential unintended consequences we must start to consider , because we probably do n't have the choice to " just say no " -- wearable computing is as certain as mobile phones			1
in his 1964 book " @entity64 , " @entity62 famously called media " the extensions of man			0
" if we can define wearables as " media " then , following mobile devices , wearables are the next logical step in this rapid evolution			1
beyond this , wearables are very likely to be followed by some kind of direct connectivity of our brains and neural systems with computers ( think brain computer interfaces ) and implants			0
we can see so much more -- and we are seen even more one of the key challenges with wearables may be similar to what we are already facing in digital media and entertainment			1
powerful , smart , internet - connected tvs are ushering in an era when we can see pretty much anything we want on enormous @entity95 screens , be it tv programs , movies and videos , photos , @entity102 conversations , tweets , games or telepresence events			2
but few of us realize that in return our " tvs " ( think : visual super-computers ) can now also " sense , " see and hear us using their built - in video cameras , microphones , data - sucking software and face - recognition apps			2
indeed , these @entity111 will truly know who we are and what we do -- and naturally , therein lies their tremendous value to those that can reach us through them			0
this is about data not just about content -- we are the ones being watched while we are watching content at ever lower cost			0
similar ( yet much more wicked ) issues are certain to arise with the boom in wearable devices			2
on the one hand , yes , we can be infinitely better and faster in gauging and understanding ourselves and the world around us using smart watches , fitness bands or smart meters			1
a nicely designed smart - watch that reminds me of my next appointment , alerts me of urgent developments in my stock portfolio , tells me that i should start exercising more or even predicts how likely me and my date are to hit it off ... all of this may seem quite useful , at least to some of us			2
at the same time , the flip side of this amazing new -- and seemingly free -- convenience is that my smart devices , virtual agents and active @entity148 apps will also get to know me better than any human ever could as far as my raw data is concerned			1
and these will be technologies that are also self - learning			0
data flows in both directions , and increasingly a faustian bargain is struck than would scare the wits out of @entity157 : trade your privacy for convenience ; jump into that amazing data and information worm - hole ; achieve super-powers ! watch the first episode of @entity166 with @entity167 on ' @entity168 ' here @entity169 and the nude beach problem to me , wearable computing devices such as @entity169 are facing what i call " the nude beach problem			1
" if everyone around me is using @entity169 i may feel like an odd - ball by not " being naked " as well			0
conversely , if i am the only that 's nude ( i.e. wearing @entity169 ) and everyone else is fully dressed , i would probably not be very welcome			0
this may help to explain the chilly reception that @entity169 users have received			0
we urgently need some new social contracts here -- but unfortunately @entity183 has rarely paid much attention to those thorny side - effects of their amazing inventions			2
this is why i believe the key opportunities for most wearable computing devices is in business or professional situations where it does n't really matter if only a few people use it , such as with doctors , firefighters or the check - in staff at the airline counter			1
in all these cases the clear purpose of technology is to better serve us , rather than for us to better serve the technology and those that dish it up			2
this will emerge as a key distinction because making humans as readable as usb drives , exploiting massive privacy failure -- whether by design or by unintended consequence -- or proposing the complete eradication of anonymity can not possibly be in the interest of any business or government except for those that seek totalitarian dominance			1
this is why those that work on wearables need to ask that all - important question : will these devices and services add real , lasting , human value to their users , or will they just be fancy digital mouse traps , addiction - generators or extensions - of - man that seek to eventually " be man " ? read more : key trends for your future read more : ten ways mobile tech will save your life read more : where are the women in tech ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			1

a world where computing becomes invisible , like your thoughts , is not very far away
one of the key challenges in this new world will be *protecting* our information and privacy
smart devices , virtual agents and @entity148 apps will know you better than your friends
as technology *undergoes* rapid *expansion* , we need to consider the social impact
