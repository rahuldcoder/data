@entity0 -- less than two weeks after @entity3 won his re-election campaign , protesters gathered sunday to call on the president and his administration to reject the proposed @entity8 tar sands pipeline , and to act on climate change			1
while @entity11 candidate @entity10 said he would support construction of the 1,700 - mile pipeline , for the jobs he said the pipeline would create , @entity3 in the past has rejected rapid approval , citing what he called the " arbitrary nature " of the deadline @entity11 proposed for passage and the need for sufficient time for the @entity24 to gather information necessary for a project that crosses into the @entity28 border			1
nearly a year ago , the @entity24 announced the decision to delay until after the 2012 election consideration of the controversial project that would originate in @entity32 , @entity33 , 's tar sands and would extend to the @entity35			1
@entity8 pipeline protesters arrested in @entity37 on sunday , protestors flooded @entity0 's @entity39 , before laying down their signs and picking up a 500 - foot plastic " oil pipe , " which they carried a few blocks to the @entity43			1
one of the event 's main organizers , founder of @entity47 , @entity46 , said that activists may have been silent but have n't forgotten about the project and now they 've organized to remind the administration of their commitment to preventing fossil fuel based projects that they say are causing increased climate change			2
" they said a year ago they would study it further , now that year is up , and in the meantime we 've had the hottest year in @entity28 history , we 've had an epic drought , we 've had the @entity64 melting and we 've had @entity65 flooding the subways of @entity67 , " said @entity56			0
" the pipeline has come to symbolize something much , much bigger than just one energy project , it 's come to symbolize what is our energy future , and what president @entity3 is going to do on climate change , " said activist @entity68 of the anti-pipeline organization @entity69 , in a state where the @entity8 project would cut through predominantly agricultural areas			2
at issue is the potential for water and soil contamination from the 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of crude oil that would traverse the pipeline each day			0
film director @entity87 , whose documentary " @entity88 " examined the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing , also known as " fracking , " was among protesters with camera in hand			0
" i 'm here doing a film on ( @entity46 's @entity96 , " and the math tells us that we have more fossil fuels in the ground than is supportable by the atmosphere without total catastrophe and calamity , " said @entity87 .			0
