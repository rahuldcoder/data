-- over the centuries , @entity2 monarchs have listed their preferred tradesmen and brands , stamping them with a seal of approval known as the @entity7			1
the warrant -- covering products such as cereals , soaps , sauces , chocolates , cars and clothing -- can only be granted by three members of the family : @entity18 , the @entity19 and the @entity20			1
it is now held by 850 brands , and allows the businesses to advertise that they supply goods or services to the royal household			1
new research from @entity28 estimates the system injects an extra @entity30 £ 4 billion to the @entity2 economy			1
further , those companies which hold the warrant together enjoy a reputational boost worth around Â £ 400 million , according to the @entity28 research			1
well - established brands like @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , or @entity40 may reap largely reputational benefits , while smaller brands can enjoy a significant financial boost from the recognition			2
" it certainly helps people have confidence in the company without a doubt , especially with our traditional markets , state insignias and stuff like that , " said @entity45 , ceo of @entity46 , a family business which has been making military trimmings for more than 300 years , and was given the warrant in 1956			0
she added : " they look at the @entity7 and say ' yes , what is good enough for the queen is good enough for us			2
' " i think there is enormous respect for the @entity2 crown and queen all over the world and some of that rubs off on those companies that have the mark of approval from the crown			2
it 's a worldwide mark of quality			0
" @entity76 & @entity77 is making around 200,000 medals for the @entity79 , a huge order which has boosted the company even as it struggles with a 30 % decline in core business over the last decade			0
the company has suffered as traditional clients such as defence ministries tighten their budgets , while societies and clubs face declining memberships			0
@entity76 & @entity77 has responded by diversifying into fashion and expanding overseas , using its @entity7 as a calling card			1
they have found that their royal endorsement has helped them build a big export book , and develop a lucrative market in the @entity97			0
such customers demand the very highest of quality but they are also willing to pay the price for the bespoke craftsmanship , @entity98 , master weaver at @entity46 , said .			0
