@entity1 gov. @entity0 says he feels no pressure to run for president at 47 because a certain political rival of his is toying with the idea well into her 60s			1
" i could run 20 years from now and still be about the same age as the former secretary of state ( @entity14 ) is right now , " the @entity9 governor said in an interview sunday with @entity12 affiliate @entity11			1
@entity0 , who was recently re-elected for a second term , says he believes that the closer you get to running for president , the more you realize how crazy you have to be to actually do it			1
" the closer you get to something like that the more you realize -- and i say this only half jokingly -- that you have to be crazy to want to be president , " he said			2
" and anyone who has seen pictures of this president or any of the former presidents can see the before and after			0
no matter how fit , no matter how young they are , they age pretty rapidly			0
" noting the toll a presidency takes on one 's health , @entity0 opened up about his bald spot becoming an issue on the campaign trail			2
" one of the frustrations for my campaign staff is they felt -- for whatever reason -- my opponent largely faced little or no scrutiny about anything , so it was an interesting contrast when i talked about the bald spot on the back of my head , which has admittedly grown beyond just being the focal point of a story or two , " @entity0 said			2
" it was just one of those things where you raise your eyebrows and say , ' really ? ' but , you know , it is what it is			0
" but despite his national presence and ongoing speculation about a 2016 presidential run , @entity0 says that he still feels compelled to serve out his term as governor			1
" the only thing i think someone ... should run for president not because they want to be or yearn to be , but because they feel called to , " he said			0
" right now , i still feel called to be the governor of the state of @entity1 , and i 'm going to do the best job i can over the next four years			1
" this is not the first time the potential 2016 candidate has taken a dig at @entity72 's age			1
shortly after the latest midterm elections , @entity0 told @entity74 that @entity72 , who recently turned 67 , embodies " old " politics			0
" i think the biggest loser ( in the midterms ) was @entity14 , " @entity0 said			2
she embodies that old , tired top - down approach from the government			0
i think in the states as governors , we offer a much better alternative , and i think there 's a number of us who would be good prospects out there			0
