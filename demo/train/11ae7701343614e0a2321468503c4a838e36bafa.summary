@entity0 -- the news that @entity3 is stepping down as @entity5 manager after 26 trophy - laden seasons will be reverberating far beyond @entity9 shores wednesday , and no more so than in @entity10 where the club has a huge following			1
to put this in perspective , a study recently commissioned by the newly - crowned @entity15 champions showed that the team 's global fan base had doubled to 659 million people between 2007 and 2012 -- with 325 million fans from @entity10 alone			1
the figures are staggering , though the number of @entity5 shirts -- official merchandise or not -- that can be seen around the streets of any major city in the region , from @entity29 to @entity30 , goes some way towards illustrating this phenomenal interest			2
@entity34 interest and the interest goes beyond simply wearing a replica shirt			0
within minutes of the shock announcement , football fans in @entity39 flocked to @entity40 , the country 's version of @entity42 , to lament @entity3 's departure			1
" @entity46 , " posted one netizen , known as @ @entity45			0
" sir @entity47 ! " declared @ @entity48			0
another , known as @ @entity50 , said : " although i do n't really like @entity51 and their red polo shirts , i have to say @entity3 is one of the most respected coaches			2
now that he 's going to retire soon , i felt really sad			0
i want to thank him for bringing all the splendidness to the team ! " wednesday 's news also found its way into the mainstream media in @entity39 , including 163.com , one of the country 's most popular news platforms			0
lucrative @entity5 has not been slow to recognize the benefits of this global appeal , regularly taking part in lucrative pre-season tours at packed venues across @entity10 to connect with local fans			1
in july , the team will visit @entity0 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
the club has also signed a number of sponsorship deals with " @entity10 partners , " including banks in @entity80 and a @entity73 social gaming company -- though this @entity10 " sweet spot " has also been clear in the minds of sponsors beyond the region			2
" we 've gone from no brand awareness in countries like @entity73 and @entity98 to incredible brand awareness , " @entity86 , chief marketing officer at @entity87 , told the @entity88 when explaining the @entity91 insurance giant 's decision to put pen to paper on a $ 23 million sponsorship deal earlier this year			0
@entity5 even explored the idea of an @entity10 stock market floatation in either @entity0 or @entity102 last year , as it eyed investors -- though market volatility at the time put these plans on hold			1
winning habit so why is the club so popular in @entity10 ? the reason is fairly straightforward , according to @entity111 , a sports journalist at the @entity112 in @entity0			1
" the one thing @entity10 football fans value above anything else is winning , and under @entity3 , @entity5 have simply been one of the most successful clubs in the world			1
@entity119 have a big following in @entity10 because of their great history , but that 's taken a dent given their recent trophy - starved years			1
" while newer champions such as @entity126 and @entity127 have been on the rise , @entity5 have had a consistent record of success under @entity3 , gaining new fans in @entity10 with every trophy won over the last two decades			1
" @entity5 's history also gives them great glamor and prestige , from the great names of the 1960s and the tragedy of the @entity140 , and that is also attractive to fans in the region			1
but most of their popularity is down to their triumphs in the last 20 years under @entity3			2
title after title , the @entity153 twice , global megastars such as @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 ... all these ingredients have made @entity5 's football brand @entity10 's best - loved			1
" @entity5 has also invested wisely in talented @entity10 players , most recently signing @entity73 's brightest talent , @entity159			1
the attacking midfielder follows in the footsteps of @entity98 star @entity162 , who spent seven hugely successful years at the club			0
the result is @entity5 's appeal borders on the fanatical at times			2
when the club announced plans to play in @entity0 this year , its first visit to the city since 2005 , tickets for the friendly against a local club sold out almost instantly			0
@entity111 said former @entity5 goalkeeper @entity172 was mobbed by fans when he arrived at @entity0 airport to promote the game , and again by local journalists at a press conference -- despite leaving the club in 1999			2
" the reception i 've had in only a couple of hours is incredible , " @entity172 told journalists at the time			0
" no doubt the club 's vast marketing arm will have many plans to maintain this popularity in @entity10 , " said @entity111			0
" but the key factor is simple : whoever the new manager is , he 'll have to keep winning trophies			0
