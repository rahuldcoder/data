obesity rates in children 2 to 5 years old have decreased significantly over the past decade , according to a new study published tuesday			1
while there were no significant changes in obesity rates for most ages between 2003 - 2004 and 2011 - 2012 , researchers saw a 43 % decline in this group 's rates -- from 13.9 % to 8.4 % , according to the study published in @entity12 , the journal of the @entity14			1
a big part of a child 's obesity risk is already established by age 5 , according to a study published in january			1
the study findings were announced the same day as first lady @entity21 proposed new rules to limit the types of foods and beverages that can be advertised in schools and marked the fourth anniversary of her let 's move ! initiative to combat child obesity			1
under the suggested federal regulations , companies would no longer be permitted to use logos of high - calorie products such as regular sodas on cups , vending machines or posters			1
the move is part of the first lady 's ongoing efforts to combat childhood obesity in @entity45			1
according to the new @entity12 study , close to 17 % of children aged 2 to 19 were obese in 2011 - 2012			1
that number has remained fairly constant since 2003 - 2004 , dropping just 0.2 %			2
more than a third of adults over 20 were obese that same year , a number that held steady over the study 's time period			1
the prevalence is often higher in women and in @entity57 and @entity58 black populations			0
four years ago this month , @entity21 announced that she was taking on childhood obesity with a new initiative called let 's move ! the comprehensive program was part parental education , part government reform -- with a bit of celebrity encouragement thrown in			1
" about one - third of our children are overweight or obese			2
none of us want that for our country , " @entity21 said at the time			1
" it 's time to get moving			2
" let 's move ! had several objectives under its broader ambition of " solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation			1
" @entity21 wanted to increase physical activity and improve nutrition in schools , overhaul nutrition labels to make healthy choices easier for families , decrease the number of calories in restaurant meals and eliminate food deserts -- areas without access to fresh , healthy foods -- in cities across @entity45			1
first lady : childhood obesity is about fitness , not looks in december 2010 , president @entity96 signed the @entity98 , @entity97 into law , which was designed to encourage better eating habits in schools by giving the federal government more authority to set standard for food sold on school grounds			1
the $ 4.5 billion act provided more money to subsidize free meals and help administrators offset the higher costs of including more fruits and vegetables in school lunches			0
then in june 2011 , the @entity115 dismantled the traditional food pyramid and replaced it with a new icon called @entity118			2
the plate emphasizes fruits and vegetables , telling @entity45 to fill half of every plate they eat with produce			0
another quarter of the plate should be lean protein ; the last quarter should be whole grains			0
a small portion of dairy -- perhaps a glass of low - fat milk -- can be added on the side			2
the first lady also tackled nutrition and physical education in childcare facilities around the country			0
let 's move ! offers guidelines for childcare providers : one to two hours of physical activity a day ; limited screen time ; more fruits and vegetables at meals served family - style when possible ; no fried foods and no sugary drinks			1
and that 's not all			2
" food manufacturers have pledged to cut 1.5 trillion calories from the products they sell			2
local grocers and national chains such as @entity161 and @entity162 are building new supermarkets and expanding existing stores to sell fresh food in 1,500 underserved communities , " @entity21 wrote in an op - ed for @entity158 in 2012			1
" restaurants are transforming their kids ' menus , packing them with healthier options			2
mayors are planting gardens and refurbishing parks			0
congregations are sponsoring summer nutrition programs for kids and exercise ministries for families			2
" even @entity179 and the @entity180 are jumping on board			0
in january 2012 , the @entity115 issued its new rules for school meals , which are being phased in over a three - year period			2
cafeterias must offer fruits and vegetables at every meal , reduce sodium and some types of fat and keep to calorie minimums and maximums			0
the government agency followed up six months later with new rules for snack foods			0
the regulations set limits for fat , salt and sugar sold in school vending machines and snack bars			0
the @entity115 has faced opposition over the new rules -- from student athletes who say they 're not getting enough calories to administrators who say kids just are n't buying the healthier options			0
which raises the question : with all these new guidelines and regulations , are kids really getting any healthier ? it 's a difficult question to answer , as the most comprehensive data collections about obesity are still a few years behind			1
but there have been signs of progress			0
@entity222 , a elementary physical education teacher in the @entity224 suburbs , says he 's noticed a change in his students -- and their parents -- over the past five years			0
overall , the kids are in better shape , he says			0
parents are asking @entity231 more questions as well , about how to keep their kids moving at home			0
and he 's received strong support from administrators in his quest to find new ways to interest students in fitness			0
recently , his first - graders were given pedometers for the first time			0
related : not your mama 's gym class " from our top level down , the initiative to keep kids moving and active has definitely been a big part of the district , " @entity222 says			1
" it 's made us all a little more aware of how active we are			0
" another study published in august 2013 that analyzed data from preschool children in low - income families showed a small but significant decline in the group 's obesity rates between 2008 and 2011			1
" it 's a bright spot for our nation 's young kids , but the fight is very far from over , " @entity262 director dr. @entity261 said at the time			1
" while childhood obesity rates are beginning to fall , we still have a long way to go before we solve this problem once and for all , " the first lady said tuesday			1
" we ca n't slow down and we ca n't turn back now			0
" let 's move ! recommends children engage in physical activity for a total of 60 minutes every day , and adults should move for 30 minutes daily			0
