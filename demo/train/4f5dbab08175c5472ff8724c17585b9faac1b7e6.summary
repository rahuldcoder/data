@entity0 -- foreign fighters inside @entity3 and @entity4 have become a massive concern for authorities worldwide			1
many are alarmed at the quick rise in the number of @entity10 who have joined militant groups trying to establish an @entity14 caliphate , with several investigations launched following the gruesome beheading of @entity18 journalist @entity17 last week			1
we have been tracking foreign fighters going into @entity3 for more than a year			1
during this time , we came across two young men willing to speak to us through @entity22 from inside the country , where they are helping battle president @entity25 's forces			1
we first spoke to them couple of months ago and have been in touch since			2
after much back and forth -- and a lot of convincing -- they agreed to an interview with us from northern @entity3 , using @entity22 in what looked like a hidden internet cafe			1
as expected , the connection was not great and it took several attempts to finally talk to them			2
despite having spoken to the pair before , it was not easy to identify which masked militant was which			2
as they sat down to begin the interview they were careful to adjust their scarves to cover most of their faces			0
an @entity49 was positioned deliberately and carefully between them			0
with unintended humour and in a serious fashion they reintroduced themselves by their jihadi aliases : @entity56 and @entity57			0
@entity56 was open to talking with us and he gradually agreed to bring other fighters along for an on - camera interview , a process made tougher as both @entity56 and @entity57 change locations every couple of months			1
@entity56 would n't tell us where he is from but @entity57 is @entity63			0
" i 'm from the south of @entity65 , " he explained			1
" i grew up in a middle - class family			1
life was easy back home			1
but the thing is : you can not practice @entity14 back home			1
" we see all around us evil			0
and we ca n't do anything about it because we are obeying [ by ] the laws of the kuffar			0
" initially , both fighters came to @entity3 to join the rebel alliance against the regime of @entity25 -- but they now believe that establishing an @entity14 caliphate is more important			1
when we asked @entity57 what message he had for friends back home , it was a call to join the fight			1
" leave the lands of infidelity and leave for the lands of @entity14 , " he said			1
" we have an @entity14 state in @entity96			1
@entity97 [ " all praise and thanks to @entity100 " ] now in @entity4			0
and i ask all my @entity103 friends to make hijrah [ " holy journey " ] to these @entity14 states			1
" in all our conversations , both men proved unfailingly polite			0
they patiently answered our questions , determined for us to see their point of view : for them , @entity18 is an immoral country at war with @entity103 our talk was dominated by discussions of what they see as @entity18 injustices , from @entity118 to @entity119			1
they also called for the release of @entity122 , a female @entity18 trained scientist convicted in 2010 of shooting at @entity18 officers while in custody in @entity125			1
@entity56 became agitated as he mentioned he has heard word that there are other @entity103 female prisoners , held in @entity18 custody , who are given the same treatment as men			1
both @entity56 and @entity57 agreed that this was a complete injustice			0
in our most recent interview we asked them about the videotaped killing of @entity18 journalist @entity17			1
" when the video was released we watched it in our base and one of the brothers downloaded it and my initial response was that this was a direct response to the crimes of the @entity18 against the @entity143 , " said @entity57			1
@entity144 added : " we thought the @entity14 state has no other choice really			1
the @entity18 has the technology but it does n't mean they can call any country and bomb anybody they want and not stop on anything			1
@entity154 tried to negotiate for a @entity103 prisoner , tried to negotiate with them for ransom but then they are too arrogant you see			0
we thought it was very justified and we thought what @entity17 said himself ... that his real killers were actually the @entity18 " their interpretation of @entity14 is radical and extreme : their sense of justice is medieval and they call the @entity166 , the @entity63 's largest @entity103 organization , " apostates			1
" we asked them if they would consider carrying out an execution by beheading			2
" this is the @entity14 way of execution and we will do only that which please @entity174 , " replied @entity57			2
" it means cutting off the necks of the enemies of @entity14 then we are more than happy to do it			2
i would like to meet the @entity174 and tell him what i did for his religion			0
i hope @entity100 gives me the chance to do what the brother did with @entity17			2
whether it 's @entity17 , or a soldier of @entity18 or @entity25 ... my hands are ready to do this blessed act			1
" but when we asked why they continue to support @entity154 -- when even @entity190 has condemned the group 's brutality -- they initially struggled to answer and their commitment wavered			0
" it 's a tactical difference , " explained @entity56			0
" @entity195 does n't say they are very brutal			0
they have operational differences with them			0
and they disagree with them			0
but whatever is islamically allowed , we do it			0
it does n't matter which group it is and what it is called , @entity154 or @entity190			0
" we had asked for more details ; on the battles they fought , on where they are positioned			0
but the men were cautious not to give too much away			0
they have sent us pictures of their basic training in a militant camp : in one photo , @entity56 is positioned in a foxhole holding a @entity49			0
the only time they seemed to pause in their @entity218 rhetoric was when discussing their families			0
when we first asked @entity57 what his mother would say , he was silent , refusing to talk about them			0
it 's clear that both expect to die in @entity3 , either in battle or in what they call a " martyrdom mission , " a suicide attack against enemy forces			2
@entity57 said that his family has given up hope of trying to bring him back			2
" no. they do n't ask me to come back any more			2
because they did at the beginning but they know now that i am not coming back			2
so , there is no point in wasting their breath			0
we pray a lot that @entity174 give you success and @entity174 accepts this jihad from you			0
they understand that i am not coming back and they know that they will not see me again in this life			2

@entity1 speaks exclusively to foreign jihadist fighters based in @entity3
one jihadist says he grew up in a middle - class family in southern @entity65
message to friends back home is to " leave for the lands of @entity14 "
pair say beheading justified , be it " @entity17 , or a soldier of @entity18 or @entity25 "
