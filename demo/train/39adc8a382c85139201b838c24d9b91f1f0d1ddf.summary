@entity0 -- in president @entity5 's two presidential campaigns , his predecessor loomed large ; @entity5 and @entity6 regularly laid the blame for the downtrodden economy at @entity10 's feet			1
when pressed on their pledge to turn the faltering economy around , @entity5 and @entity6 often pointed out that they had inherited the product of the @entity10 administration 's policies			1
@entity10 , however , in his limited public appearances has stayed mute about his successor , maintaining a custom among former presidents that dates back decades			1
while not all presidents have adhered to the practice , it has created a mostly amicable brotherhood of former presidents			1
" @entity10 is a traditionalist , " @entity1 senior political analyst @entity26 said			1
" i think he holds to an old - fashioned standard that the presidency is one of the world 's greatest fraternities and its members do n't criticize each other			1
" after leaving the @entity35 , @entity10 made it clear that he was finished with the public stage			1
although he has been more public since his presidential library opened in april , @entity10 has maintained that he will not criticize @entity5			1
" i do n't think it does any good , " @entity10 said monday in an exclusive interview with @entity1 's @entity41 in @entity42 , where he was helping to renovate a women 's clinic			1
" it 's a hard job			0
he 's got plenty on his agenda			0
a former president does n't need to make it any harder			0
other presidents have taken different decisions ; that 's mine			0
" @entity10 's new mission : helping those with the least in " @entity61 , " a book by @entity58 and @entity59 about the fraternity , a @entity10 adviser says the most the former president will say about @entity5 's decisions is , " well , i might have done it differently			1
" in public , though , @entity10 has refused to comment on @entity5			1
" he deserves my silence , " @entity10 said in a march 2009 speech			1
" there 's plenty of critics in the arena			0
i think it 's time for the ex-president to tap dance off the stage and let the current president have a go at solving the world 's problems			0
" @entity81 : @entity10 interview unexpected friendships @entity26 said he feels @entity10 's silence about @entity5 stems from how @entity10 was treated in his last few years in office			1
" there was a sense among the @entity10 people that a lot of this criticism was gratuitous and ill - informed and painful , " @entity26 said			1
that could be " part of his staying away from issues with @entity5			1
" when you are president , there are literally only a handful of people in the world who can relate to the pressure , the commitment , the arduous decision making			0
this unique understanding has led many presidents to rely on one another after leaving office			0
former , current presidents on @entity10 some of these relationships have led to unexpected political friendships			1
despite the fact they faced off in the 1992 presidential election , the relationship of @entity111 and @entity112 has been described as father - and - son - like			0
they are so close that @entity111 joked at the opening of @entity10 's library that he " had become the black sheep son " of the @entity10 family			1
5 presidents on hand for @entity125 opening he even jokingly referred to former first lady @entity126 as his " mother			0
" @entity111 praises @entity10 at library opening other presidential relationships have been similarly close			2
presidents @entity132 and @entity134 , opponents in the 1976 election , grew close in their retirement and worked together on a number of international issues			1
president @entity138 also befriended a predecessor , @entity139			0
after working together to restructure the executive branch , @entity138 called @entity139 " the best man that i know of " and an appreciative @entity139 wrote @entity138 to say , " for all of this and your friendship , i am deeply grateful			0
" most former presidents look better through history 's eyes @entity26 , who served in the @entity35 in four administrations , said that once in the @entity151 you appreciate the " continuity of the office			0
" " you form part of a chain and each link is important			0
you almost have a sacred responsibility to keep the office strong , " he said			0
breaking the club 's rules not all former presidents have held their tongue			2
@entity6 president @entity132 , who served one term in office , has a history of biting criticism of those who followed him in the @entity35			1
in 2007 , @entity132 delivered a blistering critique of the @entity10 administration , telling the @entity172 " as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world , this administration has been the worst in history			1
" @entity132 has n't directed his criticism only at @entity179 , though			1
in a february 2013 speech , he faulted the @entity5 administration for its dealings with @entity183 and @entity184			2
" our country is now looked upon as the foremost warlike nation on @entity188 , and there is almost a complete dearth now of commitment of @entity192 to negotiate differences with others , " @entity132 said			2
and throughout much of @entity111 's presidency , @entity132 was a @entity6 agitator			1
he embarked on his own foreign policy projects , at times at direct odds with the @entity35 , and after @entity111 's affair with @entity200 became public , @entity132 questioned @entity111 's morals			2
even after @entity111 left office , @entity132 continued to criticize			2
in february 2001 , a month after the @entity111 presidency had ended , @entity132 said @entity111 's last - minute pardon of @entity205 was a " most serious mistake " and even alleged that the reason @entity205 was pardoned was donations that @entity205 had made			2
" i do n't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts , " @entity132 said			1
" in my opinion , that was disgraceful			0
" but @entity132 has been the exception , not the rule			1
while some presidents have stepped out and criticized during the heat of a political campaign , it is a rare occurrence			0
" @entity132 puts issues ahead of fraternity and will often speak out about things , " @entity26 said			2
" i think it is part of his nature			0
maybe being a one - term president changes your view			0
" ' @entity230 ' and the @entity231 @entity232 is by most accounts the gold standard for how to deal with other presidents			1
@entity232 chewed out his successor , @entity236 , in private for the botched @entity237 , but publicly offered him a level of support			1
@entity236 had been in office for just three months when he called for a meeting with @entity232 in april 1961 after the attempt to topple the young @entity245 regime in @entity246 was a massive failure			2
the operation had originated before @entity232 left office and @entity236 's administration had carried it out			2
the @entity252 relationship had been frosty			0
@entity232 had long viewed @entity236 as naive and young -- he referred to @entity236 as " @entity230 " in private -- and @entity236 had disparaged the @entity232 administration in his 1960 presidential campaign			2
the two put their chilly relationship aside , however , and @entity236 invited the former general to @entity258 to review the mistakes in @entity246			0
according to @entity232 's notes from the meeting and a number of media reports , the conversation between the new and former president previewed the pitfalls of foreign policy campaign promises : @entity236 : " no one knows how tough this job is until he 's been in it a few months			2
" @entity232 : " mr. president			2
if you will forgive me , i think i mentioned that to you three months ago			0
" after the meeting , @entity232 stood in front of television cameras and said , " i am all in favor of the @entity192 supporting the man who has to carry the responsibility for our foreign affairs			0
" in " @entity61 , " @entity58 and @entity59 write that despite the fact that all of these men have risen to the highest level of their profession , they not only work better together , but they need one another			0
" there is no fraternity like it anywhere , and not just because of the barriers to entry of the privilege of membership , " they write			0
" for all of the club 's self - serving habits and instincts , when it is functioning at its best , it can serve the president , help solve his problems and the nation 's , and even save lives			0

former presidents regularly hold their tongue when asked about their successors
" i do n't think it does any good , " @entity10 said when asked about @entity5
@entity132 has n't adhered to the rule and regularly critiques @entity6 and @entity179
@entity232 is considered the gold standard for working with a successor
