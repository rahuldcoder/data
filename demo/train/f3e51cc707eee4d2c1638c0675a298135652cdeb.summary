@entity0 , @entity1 -- the violin she uses is cheap by most standards : made in @entity7 , it costs about $ 150			1
but that 's an absolute fortune for @entity9			1
on the day we visited her , the 15 - year - old aspiring musician could n't even afford breakfast			0
@entity9 shares a one - bedroom shack with eight relatives in a sprawling shantytown on the outskirts of @entity0 called @entity18 , or @entity19			0
the narrow path leading to their door is lined with the bottles and cans they collect to supplement their income			0
" the guy who recycles these bottles did n't pick them up and pay us , " @entity9 said			0
" so we did n't have money to buy bread			0
" @entity9 rarely sees her father , who is in and out of jail , or her mother , a live - in maid who she says is working hard so her kids can get out of the slums			1
but @entity9 thinks she has finally discovered her own way out : music			1
less than a year ago , she joined a new classical music project at the @entity18 cultural center			1
each student is given a violin and offered free -- yet very intensive -- classes once a week			1
" music has changed my life , " she said			2
" i study eight hours a day all of the instruments i have at home : violin , guitar and keyboard			0
" the program was dreamed up by @entity52 , an acclaimed classical pianist whose career was cut short by injury			1
he reinvented himself as a successful composer , and seven years ago he went to one of @entity1 's notorious favelas , or slums , in search of raw talent			1
" i discovered so many naturally talented children that i decided to build a project , " he said			2
" in 10 years , i intend to build 1,000 string orchestras in underprivileged areas across our country			0
" according to the latest census , more than 11 million @entity1 are living in favelas , many of them without access to running water or sewage systems			1
and there are more than a billion people living in slums worldwide , according to @entity76			1
across all continents , there are hundreds of millions of children who lack access to electricity , clean water and education despite living in cities with modern facilities and technology			1
" one in three urban dwellers lives in slum conditions ; in @entity95 , the proportion is a staggering six in 10 , " said @entity88 executive director @entity87 in a report this year called " @entity90 " ( @entity91 )			2
" the impact on children living in such conditions is significant			1
" from @entity101 and @entity102 to @entity103 and @entity104 , children living in slums are among the least likely to attend school			1
and disparities in nutrition separating rich and poor children within the cities and towns of @entity95 are often greater than those between urban and rural children			2
" @entity113 is all too familiar with that			0
@entity113 , one of this year 's top 10 @entity115 , grew up in a @entity117 slum where he and his siblings felt like they had no control over their future			1
his older siblings dropped out of school because of financial pressure , and he had to wash cars and work as a stock boy just so he could stay in school			0
@entity113 eventually became the first person in his family to graduate from high school			0
now he 's giving back to the youth in @entity132 , the slum where he was raised			1
he helped start the @entity133 , which provides academic support , meals and after - school activities to 400 disadvantaged children			2
" we did n't want to see other young people going through what we 'd gone through : no uniforms ... feeling hungry in class , " @entity113 said			0
" we know the problems of this community , but we also know the solutions			0
" by giving children education and encouragement , the idea is that the children will feel empowered and go on to become successful , productive members of society -- instead of becoming disillusioned and falling into gangs or a life of crime			1
" we want them to realize there 's something they can contribute to this world			2
... we 're trying to give them the sense that everything is possible , " @entity113 said			0
photos : making charcoal in a @entity167 slum in @entity1 , @entity52 says his music classes help fight crime , not only by getting youth off the streets , but by giving them the tools that could lead to jobs -- and salaries -- their parents never dreamed of			1
" for some , ( music ) gives them a hobby , " he said			2
" for others , it gives them a profession , like a wedding performer			0
and finally , there are the diamonds " who go on to be professional musicians			0
but @entity52 says he has had to overcome sometimes unexpected difficulties			0
" when one child took his violin to his house , his father sold his violin , " he said			0
nonetheless , many of the first students @entity52 took under his wing are already working as musicians and music teachers			2
and the @entity18 students who gather every thursday are enthusiastic about their future			2
@entity9 has a modest dream to become a music teacher for other slum children like herself			1
" i play with all my heart , " she says , breaking down in tears			0
" if it were n't for music , i 'd be a drug addict or a prostitute or out robbing			0
because that 's the reality here			0
" more from @entity115 : @entity215 girls take brave first step young caregivers put life on hold what really sways teens not to drink , drive ? @entity222 living in fear ' under the tent ' @entity2 's @entity225 and @entity226 contributed to this report .			1
