-- three days after @entity3 crash landed at @entity4 with the loss of two lives , there is still no official explanation for what caused the incident			1
officials have said the @entity11 , which had flown from @entity12 in @entity13 , was traveling slower than recommended on its final approach , though it could be months before a definite cause for this is determined			1
before that an expert team of air crash investigators must complete a thorough analysis of the events leading up to the crash			1
@entity0 looks at how such an investigation works			2
interactive : what happened with @entity3 ? who 's in charge of the investigation ? according to international protocol , air crash investigations are handled by the country in which a crash occurs			1
in the @entity33 , the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) is the government agency that investigates all major aviation accidents			1
its purpose is to explain accidents and provide safety recommendations			2
since it was formed in 1967 , the @entity32 has completed more than 132,000 aviation accident investigations , with most taking weeks or even months to complete			1
did passengers ignore safety messages ? what happens after a crash ? in the first hours after a major accident occurs , the @entity32 deploys a " go - team " of technical experts , who are on call 24/7 with their bags packed			1
" once they arrive , it 's like police arriving on a crime scene , " explained @entity47 , a journalist and aviation expert			2
the area must be secured , and all evidence must be documented , mapped , and collected			2
two of the most important pieces to recover are the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder -- more commonly known as the " black box			0
" both devices are designed to survive extreme impacts			0
in the exhaustive investigation that follows , all factors -- mechanical , operational , and human performance -- are taken into account			1
here , the @entity32 relies largely on other parties , including the airline involved , the aircraft 's manufacturer , and in the case of international flights , investigators from the airline 's home country , to help examine evidence			1
in the case of @entity3 , @entity76 will be expected to provide " whatever information is demanded of it , " according to @entity47			1
@entity11 will provide technical expertise during the examination of the aircraft , while @entity13 investigators will offer insight from the @entity13 perspective , as well as assistance with translation -- especially when questioning passengers and crew			2
" the @entity32 essentially acts as a coordinating body for other parties , " explained @entity90 , a former @entity11 air safety engineer			1
" everyone else is playing a support role			0
" because of the large amount of evidence , the @entity32 never speculates prematurely			1
" first guesses are often wrong , " said retired pilot @entity97 , who successfully ditched a @entity99 flight in @entity101 's @entity100 in 2009 after the aircraft was disabled when flying through a flock of geese			0
" there are so many factors that could potentially impinge on this -- we do n't even know what they are yet , " he cautioned			2
what happens to the pilots after a crash ? although air crash investigations can seem a lot like the tv show " csi , " though in the @entity33 a crash is not legally considered a crime scene unless terrorism or sabotage is suspected early on			1
" the pilot is free to go to his hotel after the crash , " said @entity47			2
" he will receive assistance from his airline and his pilot 's union			0
" but shortly after an incident , the @entity32 interviews the pilots and then compares their stories with data from the plane 's voice and data recorders to construct a picture of the plane 's last moments			1
@entity47 said investigators are " certainly prioritizing what happened in the cockpit , " as they seek to explain why @entity3 crash landed			1
@entity97 said investigators will be looking at human factors , such as fatigue â € ” though he stressed it is far too early in the investigation to rule this in or out			1
" when they landed in @entity4 at 11.30 in the morning , it was 3.30 am on their body clocks -- a low point of alertness			0
" how do passenger and eyewitness accounts help ? the @entity32 works quickly to interview survivors and eyewitnesses after a crash			1
" these statements can corroborate flight data , and even fill in gaps , " said @entity90			0
" remember , a black box does n't get you photographic data			0
sometimes the only visual recording device that we have is people 's eyeballs , " he said			0
" one interesting question for investigators to ask people might be : ' when did you start seeing smoke and flames inside the cabin ? ' that would be helpful with the sequencing of events			1
" additionally , the @entity32 tries to collect as much photo and video of the crash as possible			1
" nowadays when people are filming with cell phones and @entity186 , all that footage becomes a crucial part of the investigation , " said @entity47			0
flight attendants hailed as heroes how long until we find out what happened with flight 214 ? the investigation will likely take many months			0
" we have n't even figured out how big the puzzle is going to be , much less how many pieces there are and how they will fit , " said @entity97			0
" this is a painstaking , methodical , analytical process			0
" one way of describing this whole investigatory process is that these investigators are in charge of writing a non-fiction detective story that may take a year to complete			2
it may eventually have 1,000 pages			0
" but @entity97 said investigators have " a huge advantage " in this case			2
" the plane and most of its components have landed on an airport and are immediately accessible			0
it 's not on the floor of the south @entity216 like @entity217 447			0
they have the crew members who survived and are able to be interviewed ... it makes it much more likely that we will eventually find out exactly what happened , how it happened , and why it happened			0
" @entity90 said he is also confident about the process			0
" the @entity33 has a habit of spending whatever it takes to finish an air crash investigation			1
when @entity231 crashed into the @entity216 in 1996 , we had thousands of government agents , a little army of people taking wreckage off of the ocean floor			0
" so in this case , i 'm certain we 'll find everything we need for a definitive conclusion			0
they will have plenty of everything they need to get this thing done			0
" shock and survival : plane crash through the eyes of children			2
