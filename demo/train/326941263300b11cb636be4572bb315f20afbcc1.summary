@entity0 , @entity1 -- a day after conflicting accounts over the death of a protester sparked clashes between security forces and demonstrators in several @entity1 cities , @entity1 's interior minister insisted police played no role in the man 's fatal injuries			1
" what happened in @entity16 is a saddening event			0
i wish peace from @entity21 for our deceased citizen , " @entity18 told journalists			0
he was referring to @entity24 , 22 , who died as a result of his injuries amid a predawn battle between demonstrators and riot police in the @entity1 border province of @entity16 on tuesday			1
" the investigation into the event was started immediately			0
however , as you also watched yesterday , footage emerged that shows there was no police intervention and that ( he ) fell from a high place			1
this is what the autopsy report says as well , " @entity40 said			2
@entity1 authorities in the province of @entity16 have not responded to @entity2 requests to share @entity48 's official autopsy report			1
meanwhile , eyewitnesses and family members of the dead protester have insisted that @entity48 did not fall from a building			0
rather , they told @entity2 , he was shot in the head at close range by a tear gas canister fired by a passing police armored personnel carrier			0
since a wave of protests erupted over government plans to replace a park in @entity65 with a shopping mall last may , human rights groups have documented cases of a number of activists who were blinded , suffered brain damage , or remain in medically induced comas a result of tear gas canisters fired at their heads			0
but @entity1 government officials have pointed to two videos to bolster the case that @entity48 fell to his death tuesday morning			2
one video from a camera aboard a police vehicle showed debris apparently being hurled from rooftops at the vehicle as it drove up @entity16 's @entity86			0
for months , the area has been the site of nearly weekly clashes between demonstrators from @entity1 's @entity92 religious minority and @entity1 security forces			2
at one moment in the video , the body of a man tumbles off of a dark curb onto the street , apparently forcing the police vehicle to swerve			0
later tuesday , a second grainy video emerged on @entity1 television that showed something that could have been a human body falling down the side of a building as police armored vehicles navigated @entity86			0
it is not clear whether the interior minister 's statements or the two videos will persuade many critics of the @entity1 government			1
at a funeral in @entity16 on tuesday , angry relatives , friends and neighbors chanted " murderer police " as they carried @entity48 's casket to a freshly dug grave			2
" @entity123 's dogs killed my son , " screamed @entity48 's mother @entity120 , in an interview with @entity2			0
she was referring to @entity123 , @entity1 's prime minister			1
@entity48 is the second man from his neighborhood -- and from the city of @entity16 's @entity92 community -- to have died amid clashes with police			1
" how he died does n't concern me , it 's just a detail , " said @entity131 , a member of parliament from the opposition @entity132 in @entity16			0
" the big picture is he died during a police intervention , " he added in an interview with @entity2			2
" how many more young kids are going to be killed by this kind of stuff ? " at least four other anti-government demonstrators -- all from @entity1 's @entity92 and @entity145 religious minorities -- have also died as a result of injuries received amid the anti-government unrest that has ebbed and waned across @entity1 throughout the summer			1
" no matter what happened , we know that there are ethnic - based provocations in @entity16 , " interior minister @entity40 told journalists wednesday			2
tear gas wafted through downtown @entity16 late tuesday night , after angry residents emerged from @entity24 's funeral to again clash with @entity1 riot police on @entity86			1
and on tuesday night , @entity1 riot police fired water cannons , plastic pellets and tear gas in @entity16 -- and in the cities of @entity0 , @entity162 and @entity65 -- to disperse angry protests that erupted in response to @entity24 's death .			1
