-- as a father , my heart breaks			0
the starting five of the @entity8 basketball team â € ” the 2012 @entity5 champions â € ” announced earlier this month that they 're leaving college to go pro. it happens every year in the wake of @entity13 , but as an @entity15 father , i feel my heart crack a little			1
yes these young champions will make money , lots of it , and will have access to instant fame			2
i understand why they made the choice , but their collective decision says something about the options in front of all young @entity15 - @entity15 men			1
the @entity30 that saw my elders move from the farm to the factory has shifted ; these days , too many men of promise move from college to pro sports			1
i 've been researching the lives of black men for much of my entire career , as a social worker for 15 years in @entity42 and since 1998 as a college professor and scholar in @entity45			1
i 've interviewed them , written about them and filmed them , capturing their lives and hopes ; i 've spent most of my time with men who had little to no incomes and limited academic and employment skills			1
they are often frustrated , homeless , unemployed and debt - ridden			0
so i know what could be ahead for young men who put all their hopes into basketball			1
according to @entity63 , author of " more than @entity64 , " for the past four decades , low - skilled @entity15 - @entity15 men have experienced more difficulty getting jobs than any other racial groups			2
in @entity45 , @entity68 of the @entity70 's @entity69 published a report in 2012 that reports when it comes to black men in their prime working years ( 25 - 54 ) only 44.7 % were employed			1
the recession has hurt people of all races , but black men have been hit the hardest when it comes to jobs			1
the starting five at @entity81 might think they 're a world away from these statistics , but how long will they actually have a career ? according to the @entity90 website , only 51 players , or 11.9 % of the players on the 2011 - 12 @entity88 opening day roster have more than 10 years of @entity88 experience			2
the average length of playing time is approximately five years and the median salary is $ 2.33 million			0
that 's a big salary for one year , but not if it has to last you far beyond your playing years			0
when my son was a child , like many boys he dreamed of being a basketball player where he grew up			2
my wife and i did n't tell him otherwise ; we told him he 'd need to have options			0
but not every child hears that and not every child has that chance			0
too many young black men are encouraged to perfect their " balling '' skills but not their academic skills			1
i know , because i was there			0
as a college athlete at the @entity114 in the late 1970s , i was a runner			0
but i also worked as the statistician for the basketball team , the @entity116 , led by the legendary @entity117			1
the players were my peers and my friends			0
and some of them did quite well , playing for the @entity121 in @entity122 , the 76ers in @entity124 and the @entity125 in @entity126			0
but not everyone left a winning @entity128			0
some of my friends did n't make it to the big leagues and because of their emphasis on basketball , they did n't graduate with a degree , either , unlike those of us in the other sports			2
some of them ended up with drug habits or homeless			0
others became fathers to children they could n't support			0
so , my heart breaks when i think of these young men from @entity81			1
but it 's not breaking at the choice they made			2
the sad truth is , i understand it			0
if you look out on a landscape where so many black men are unemployed , rolling the dice on the pros can feel like a rational choice -- the only choice , maybe , when there are so few options , despite the terrible odds			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			1

the starting five of the champion @entity165 basketball team are going pro
@entity161 says he understands their choice but *wonders* about larger *message*
he says black men , hit hard by recession , need to focus on *education*
@entity161 : too many young men encouraged to perfect athletic skills , not academic ones
