-- amid all the talk about storm clouds gathering over the @entity5 economy , it 's easy to forget there are other places in the world where the sun is still shining			1
a shortage of housing is contributing to an inflation rate of almost 14 percent in @entity13 take @entity13 , for example ; a small emirate in the @entity18 whose economy is booming			1
when the final figures come in , @entity13 's economy is expected to have grown 17.8 percent in 2007			1
@entity21 predicts growth to slow in 2008 , but at 16.5 percent who could complain ? well , consumers for one			0
while growth has steamed ahead , so has inflation			0
at the end of 2007 , @entity13 's official inflation rate was nearing 14 percent -- the highest in the region			1
three major factors are contributing to @entity13 's soaring inflation rate : high levels of government spending ; growing demand for housing , which is pushing up house prices and rent , and the riyal 's peg with the dollar , which is pushing down interest rates			1
the @entity42 exacerbated the latter problem by slashing @entity5 interest rates twice in the past eight days to three percent			1
@entity18 with currencies linked to the @entity5 dollar were under pressure to follow suit			1
@entity13 reduced its deposit rate to 3.5 percent , but left its lending rate at 5.5 percent			2
@entity52 , @entity53 , @entity51 says @entity13 is facing a serious problem			2
" you 've huge a amount of monetary easing and if you think that that 's not even going to feed through properly for six to nine months then , you 've got a really dangerous inflationary outlook , " she says			2
" the only policy option really that they have is to revalue the exchange rate			0
" @entity67 did just that in may , ditching the dollar - peg for a basket of currencies , and speculation is growing that other @entity69 ( @entity69 ) countries will do the same			1
@entity70 , vice president and senior analyst at @entity74 's @entity73 , says the argument for revaluation is becoming more convincing			0
" the economic justification for revaluation is growing stronger as inflation multiplies and the government increases expenditure			2
" he says any move by @entity18 governments to curb public spending would not be welcomed by locals facing higher living costs			2
in @entity13 's instance , new housing stock is expected to come onto the market to help ease inflation in the rental market			1
" there is some hope that prices will begin to slow as that supply comes onto the market , but that 's not guaranteed , " @entity70 says			0
so that leaves a currency revaluation			0
" the easier policy option would presumably be to revalue , but that also has political difficulties			0
it involves to some extent coordinating with @entity69 members			2
" in the past , @entity107 has ruled out any change to its dollar - peg			1
@entity13 has made it clear that it prefers any move to be made with a @entity69 consensus			1
in an interview with @entity115 , @entity13 prime minister @entity113 said that the emirate is " studying all options " in relation to the dollar - peg			1
" every country has to see its way out of this , but only after a consultation with the @entity69 , " he said			2
" for us , our wish is that it 's a policy to be taken by the whole @entity69 , to either basket or revalue our currency			2
i can not see a decision			0
even in @entity13 , we have no decision up to now			0
" this week , one of @entity13 's leading economic advisors was quoted as saying any policy change would have to be substantial			1
in an interview with @entity136 news agency , @entity133 said , " change should be major ; minor change wo n't solve the problem			0
" he ruled out any potential moves to float the @entity13 riyal			0
" as a small country we can not float our currency ... it has to be tied , " he said			0
one of the main reasons @entity69 members are reluctant to abandon their dollar link is because they 're working towards their own monetary union			1
a policy diversion now may make it more difficult to unite again under a common currency by the nominated deadline of 2010			0
there 's widespread skepticism that that deadline can be reached			0
" the timeframe of 2010 is rather unlikely now , and the project itself seems to be facing increasing difficulties given the pressure on individual states to go their own way and revalue , " @entity70 says			0

@entity13 's economy is booming , but emirate has the highest inflation rate in @entity18
two *recent* cuts in @entity5 interest rates putting pressure on @entity18 currencies
@entity13 @entity174 says " studying all options " on dollar - peg , @entity69 consensus ideal
members reluctant to drop the dollar - peg despite growing inflationary pressure
