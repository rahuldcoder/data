-- @entity3 press secretary @entity2 's outburst in @entity4 , @entity5 , on tuesday , during which he told a reporter to " shove it , " is of a piece with the @entity9 spectacle of his candidate 's world tour			1
but to this veteran of many campaign tours , the incident raises a provocative question about modern campaign history : when and how did the @entity17 become the championship party of whining ? @entity20 brought it up earlier this month with his bracing instruction to @entity3 to quit complaining about @entity25 ' negative campaign ads. such ads , deployed against @entity27 et al , were after all the instrument that brought @entity3 the @entity17 nomination			1
any short history of the whining sweepstakes should start by noting that a tectonic shift is taking place when the candidates and handlers of one side begin asking , in some form , this question : why are they being allowed to do to us what we 've happily been doing to them since -- to choose a recent precedent to this partisan shift -- the swift boating of @entity46 ? you see what 's that led to ? why , these @entity50 want to turn @entity3 's brilliant business career into an unpatriotic defect ! news : @entity3 trip an ' embarrassing disaster , ' @entity55 team says the current situation is noteworthy because the @entity25 seemed to have the exclusive franchise on piteous bleating dating back to @entity61 's victory in 1968 and throughout the @entity62 and @entity63 years			1
truth be told , the @entity25 managed to keep whining throughout most of the triumphant @entity65 years			2
the game changer clearly has been @entity55 , whose surprising taste for bloodying the noses of domestic critics and foreign adversaries seems to hark back to the last time the @entity25 were unashamed political warriors			2
that would be 1960 , when @entity79 and his snarling little brother @entity80 made political " ruthlessness , " unrestrained campaign spending , @entity75 support and mayor @entity77 's vote - counting techniques into virtues			0
the era of bullying @entity25 pretty well ended with @entity84 's cardigan sweater and " malaise speech			2
" video : @entity3 aide to media : ' show respect ! ' then , with the victory of @entity62 in 1980 , the @entity25 ' claimed the whining trophy outright			1
@entity92 sealed the @entity25 ascendancy with his high - pitched complaints about @entity62 's " compassion gap			2
" and it has taken @entity3 to mount a full - scale effort to take back the title			0
( pioneering credit , however , must be given to sen. @entity100 with his plaintive cries of " where 's the outrage ? " in response to voters ' apparently bottomless forgiveness for @entity65 's shenanigans			0
) to find the wellsprings of 2012 @entity17 whining , i think one has to look at the party 's setters of tone and themes			1
start with @entity3 and his cries of foul over the @entity55 campaign 's use of " @entity120 - style " politics			1
the vibe of this complaint is that of a suburban prep schooler who has wandered into a playground where the mean city boys took his football and then twisted his arm really hard			0
news : @entity3 trip may not matter much to voters in november the signature moment in this year 's use of the @entity135 word came in early july when an @entity55 staffer said that @entity3 was either a " felon " or was " misrepresenting " in his federal filing about the length of his tenure as head of @entity141			2
like much of today 's campaign talk , the accusation was hyperbolic , verging on the demagogic			0
in other words , it was well within the strike zone the @entity17 institutionalized in 1988 when they turned the @entity17 's amiable hitman @entity149 loose with his " @entity152 " ad against @entity151			2
but when the @entity153 dared escalate the rhetorical arms race , @entity3 feigned outrage			0
now he wanted an apology even though he had defended his own blistering attacks last spring on his primary rivals as a standard part of grown - up politics			0
@entity3 's campaign even piled one whine upon another by running a commercial showing a plaintive @entity164 saying " shame on you , @entity55 " during the savage 2002 @entity25 primaries			1
" stop whining ! " @entity120 mayor @entity20 , @entity55 's former chief of staff , demanded on the @entity168 sunday show recently			0
" " if you want to claim @entity141 as your calling card to the @entity153 , then defend what happened at @entity141			0
" there 's something inescapably petulant about @entity3 's preference for critiquing all aspects of the economyâ € ” but not his role at @entity141			0
the democrats should turn a deaf ear to his pleas for mercy on his record as a businessman and tax shelterer			0
the new @entity188 poll figures showing @entity55 ahead in @entity189 , @entity185 and @entity186 demonstrate that @entity17 - style attack politics work for anyone with the gumption to use them , including this year 's pugnacious @entity25			1
for the rest of this election season , if @entity25 are smart , they 'll keep reaching into the @entity149 bad - boy trick bag and let the season 's reigning choir of complaint blend its many voices : the charismatic duo of @entity203 and @entity204 , the tea party , the anchors and panelists of @entity208 and now the hapless @entity2			1
they all seem to know the same tunes : why do n't voters believe what we do ? why is n't @entity55 the milquetoast he looks like ? why ca n't we change the photo - op rules for @entity3 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1
