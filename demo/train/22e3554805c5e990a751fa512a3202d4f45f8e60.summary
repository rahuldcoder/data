-- there 's a great story about @entity4 icon @entity3			1
when he was first running to succeed his brother @entity5 in the @entity6 , he was attacked for being a child of privilege			0
@entity3 had nannies and nursemaids and private schools			2
he 'd hobnobbed with ambassadors and princes and popes			0
so the story -- perhaps not even true , but what the heck -- is that young @entity3 was campaigning outside a factory in the predawn chill			2
as he shook hands with the working men , one stopped him and said , " so you 're young @entity3 ? they say you have n't worked a day in your life			1
" to which @entity3 shrugged and answered , " i suppose that 's true			1
" and the man replied , " you ai n't missed a thing			0
" @entity4 have a tradition of electing aristocratic populists			1
@entity36 and @entity37 were patricians			2
and one of the senior democrats in the @entity6 today is as rich as a @entity41			0
since 1977 , first as governor of @entity45 , then senator , he has been elected and re-elected by the coal miners and farm families of @entity45			0
so the current hyperventilation over @entity50 's comments about her relative wealth and her lucrative book and speaking deals misses the point			1
voters want to know what 's in her heart and what 's on her mind , not what 's in her wallet			1
@entity63 was already wealthy when she ran for president in 2008			2
yet in the primary in @entity67 -- a bastion of blue - collar voters -- she bested @entity71 by 12 points among voters earning between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 a year , according to @entity0 exit polls			2
@entity36 , @entity37 , @entity41 and all the other wealthy @entity4 were seen as champions of working people			1
all her life , she has been a tireless advocate for the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle class			1
from her days at the @entity82 to her advocacy for the rights of women and girls around the world , @entity63 has a consistent record of fighting for middle - class economics and middle - class values			1
as an adviser to the super pac that hammered @entity94 's business record , let me explain why @entity63 's case is different			1
the issue was never how much money @entity94 had ; it was how he made that money			2
when you amass a megafortune in part by taking over companies , loading them with debt , plunging them into bankruptcy while paying yourself millions -- well , folks do n't like that			0
and when @entity94 combined that @entity110 image with an agenda that included cutting taxes for the rich and making @entity114 a voucher program , voters got the sense that he was not on their side			2
there is a dichotomy of elitism			0
@entity121 ' downfall is economic elitism			0
for generations they 've been seen as the party of the rich			0
democrats do n't have that problem			0
their achilles ' heel is cultural elitism : the sense that they value highfalutin ' @entity133 degrees more than practical experience ; that they look down their noses at folks who go to church , hunt and fish , and salute the flag			0
both are caricatures , to be sure			0
but as a @entity4 strategist i am always more worried about cultural elitism than a @entity148 's wealth			1
and remember : @entity149 had degrees from both @entity151 and @entity152 but was seen as a down - home guy you could have a beer with			0
there 's no doubt that this is a populist moment			0
@entity158 worry about the collapse of the @entity160 and the shrinking of the middle class			1
if @entity63 runs on an agenda of empowering working people -- with an increase in the minimum wage , equal pay for women , student debt relief , increased availability of child care , prekindergarten , and an end to tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas -- few voters will care how fat her bank account is .			1

@entity181 : @entity4 have tradition of electing aristocratic populists like @entity3 , @entity36
why is @entity50 taking heat for relative wealth ? voters know what 's in her heart , he says
he says @entity4 like @entity36 long seen as champions of working people ; same with @entity63
@entity194 : @entity63 is no @entity94 ; she 's long been tireless advocate for middle class
