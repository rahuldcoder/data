a small percentage of @entity2 users in @entity9 are impacted , " the network said in a statement			2
" we do not know who is responsible , nor can we confirm where it came from , " the statement continued			0
a @entity2 spokesman said the web site began to notice problems around midday thursday and took measures to isolate the trouble by limiting the number of users who could access it from specific geographic areas			1
as a result , he said , some users in those areas experienced temporary slowdowns or problems accessing the site			2
the spokesman could not offer an estimate of how many users were affected			0
however , he said that the impact on daily usage was " imperceptible " and that the site " at no time " went down			0
service had returned to normal by mid-morning friday , he said			0
