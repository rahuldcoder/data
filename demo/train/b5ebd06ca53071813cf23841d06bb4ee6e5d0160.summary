-- a refugee and mother of three young boys who is being held in indefinite detention in @entity5 has two days to convince the country 's highest court why she should be freed			1
it 's her last shot at overturning a government policy which was recently condemned by a @entity12 @entity11 report as " cruel , inhuman and degrading			2
" failure will mean that @entity14 , a 34 - year - old @entity15 refugee , will continue to be held without trial for the foreseeable future , for reasons that remain a national secret			1
and she 's not the only one			0
" the core issues in @entity14 's case are common to more than 50 other refugees deemed a security risk and has serious implications for their liberty too , " said her lawyer @entity21 , who as the executive director of @entity5 's @entity23 , is representing most of the refugees involved			1
@entity14 is seeking to be released into the community to live with her family , the two young boys she fled with who are now aged seven and nine , her new husband and their eight - month - old child			1
" it has caused @entity14 , her boys and her husband profound distress and harm , " @entity21 said			2
" every day of detention is another day of damage			0
" @entity0 is unable to verify details of @entity14 's story with the @entity5 @entity46 ( @entity46 ) because it will not comment on individual cases			1
@entity14 's supporters say they suspect her detention has something to do with her former husband , a @entity51 who was killed during fighting in @entity15 , though that is unable to be confirmed			1
fleeing @entity15 @entity14 fled @entity15 in 2008 with her two sons @entity54 and @entity55 -- then aged four and two -- two years after her husband and their father was killed in the civil war			2
they 're from the @entity61 , where the @entity12 has alleged both the government and the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) targeted civilians , according to a report released in march 2011			0
they first went to @entity67 , but @entity14 struggled to care for her family so paid a people smuggler to board a boat to @entity5			1
during what she has described as a " painful " journey , the boat ran out of fuel and was eventually intercepted by the @entity74 who took the bedraggled and by now desperate asylum seekers to @entity77 for processing			0
@entity14 and her sons were moved to the @entity5 cities of @entity81 , then @entity82 before being released to community detention in @entity84 in 2011			1
in september of the same year , @entity14 and the boys were granted refugee status			1
their three - year quest for safety and freedom was over			0
opinion : @entity5 parties in race to bottom on asylum issue back in detention in december 2011 , @entity14 met a man , @entity97 , who is also from @entity15 but was living in @entity5 as a permanent resident , working as an @entity100 consultant in @entity101			1
the @entity102 gave them permission to marry , and in april 2012 they exchanged vows in a traditional @entity51 ceremony witnessed by 200 guests			0
however , within one month , @entity14 was back in custody			2
immigration officials summoned the family to a meeting to inform them that she had failed a security test and would be detained indefinitely			1
she and the boys were flown to the @entity114 in @entity115			0
the next day she found out she was pregnant with @entity97 's child			0
born into custody @entity118 was born in january , 2013 , and lives with his mother in detention			0
" i ca n't take the baby out , because if i take him out he 'll cry , " @entity97 told @entity0			0
" once i tried but i could n't keep him calm			0
after 10 minutes he started crying so i took him back			0
" he has taken @entity118 into the car park for photos ; cameras are n't allowed within the detention center			0
and last month , @entity14 was allowed to visit @entity97 's home for four hours for a @entity129 ceremony called @entity130 , which marks the arrival of their baby 's first teeth			1
as an @entity5 citizen , @entity118 is not being detained			1
nor are his brothers who were granted permanent residency in june			0
the elder boys choose to live with their mother during the week , but leave the secure facility every friday to spend weekends with @entity97			0
@entity97 says over the past 16 months the boys have come to realize that other detainees only stay for a month or two while their claims are processed			0
" they see people come and go but only their mother ca n't get out			0
it makes them very sad			0
they 're starting to realize that their mother is in a difficult situation -- it 's very hard for them , " he said			2
detained as national security risk the security test that @entity14 failed was conducted by the @entity155 ( @entity155 )			1
according to its website , @entity155 says part of its protective security work is " to assess whether people applying for entry or permanent residence visas have the potential for espionage , have links with a terrorist organization , or may in other ways be a threat to national security			1
" refugees who fail the assessment are not told why and they have no right to legal appeal			0
because they 're refugees , the country is obliged to offer them protection under international law			0
but under @entity5 law , they ca n't be freed			1
on wednesday , the @entity177 will be asked to assess whether it 's legal under @entity5 law and the constitution to detain refugees indefinitely and " whether @entity5 law puts a different value on liberty for non-citizens , one where liberty is more easily put in jeopardy , " @entity21 said			1
it 's not known when the court will release its findings , nor the extent of the potential implications for more than 50 other refugees in the same situation			1
' serious psychological harm ' @entity5 's policy of indefinite detention has been harshly criticized in the past , most recently by a special committee of 18 human rights experts assembled by the @entity12			1
in a report released on august 22 , the committee said the policy was inflicting " serious psychological harm " on the 46 detainees who brought their complaints , the largest ever against @entity5 , to the @entity12 @entity204			2
" the combination of the arbitrary character of ( their ) detention , its protracted and / or indefinite duration , the refusal to provide information and procedural rights to ( them ) and the difficult conditions of detention are cumulatively inflicting serious psychological harm upon them , " the @entity11 said			2
the report claimed the policy represented 143 violations of international law and urged @entity5 to free , compensate and rehabilitate the refugees involved			2
@entity14 was not one of the detainees who took their complaints to the @entity12 , though she is among those being held			1
the independent reviews almost one year ago , the @entity5 government , then led by @entity229 , appointed an independent reviewer to examine evidence used by @entity155 to determine whether a refugee was a national security risk			1
it followed an @entity5 @entity236 report into the country 's @entity237 which found that cases of indefinite detention should be subject to review			1
of the 10 reviews completed so far by retired @entity244 judge @entity243 , eight of the negative assessments were found to be " appropriate			0
" @entity14 's was one of them			1
she still does n't know exactly why			0
" we did n't expect that outcome , " @entity97 said			0
" we were expecting that ( the judge ) would give a positive indication to release @entity14			2
that was very sad for myself and my family			0
" political parties vie for asylum votes @entity5 's asylum policy has been one of the key issues of the upcoming @entity5 election to be held on september 7			1
both leading political parties have announced plans that include sending asylum seekers offshore for processing			0
under a @entity265 government , led by @entity266 , asylum seekers found to be refugees would be settled in @entity268 or the island of @entity270			0
none would be allowed to remain in @entity5			2
the opposition 's policy , led by @entity274 , goes a step further and proposes refusing permanent visas to some 32,000 people already in @entity5 who are waiting for their claims to be processed			1
both parties have defended their policies as necessary to discourage the thousands of people who are paying people smugglers to board often unseaworthy boats for the dangerous trip to @entity5			2
" what we 're seeking to do through these arrangements at the moment is to send a message to people smugglers around the world that the business model is basically undermined , '' @entity266 said during the policy launch			0
" it says if you jump on a boat you 're going to end up in @entity5			2
that does n't apply any more			0
'' @entity274 -- who is currently leading pre-election opinion polls -- went one step further over the weekend in announcing that , if he came to power , asylum seekers would be denied government - funded legal assistance , a move the @entity306 of @entity5 has slammed as " disastrous " for people seeking refuge			1
@entity274 would also scrap independent reviews for people like @entity14 , denying them the one opportunity they have for their cases to be re-examined			2
@entity14 's court hearing -- hope neither @entity14 nor her husband will be in court for the hearing in @entity318 on wednesday and thursday , but they 're both eager for her ordeal to be over			1
" we are looking forward to the outcome because she 's been in detention since 2010 -- one way or another she 's been in detention , " he said			2
despite the setbacks -- including the independent reviewer 's confirmation of the negative @entity155 security assessment -- @entity97 is daring to hope that the @entity177 will rule in @entity14 's favor			1
" there were two boys , now there are three boys ... i trust the system so at least they will think that because of her family -- myself and the boys are here -- i 'm expecting a positive outcome , " he said .			0
