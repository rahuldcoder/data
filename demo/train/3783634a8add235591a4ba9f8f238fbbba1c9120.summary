-- @entity1 and @entity2 attempted to shoot a street scene in @entity4 for the indie film " @entity6 " when they realized that the area they were using was right across from an elementary school			1
tons of little kids eager for a boy - wizard sighting started lining up across the fence and yelling at @entity1			1
the actor formerly known as @entity17 obliged			1
" he said something like , ' hey , it 's really good to meet you guys , but we 're making a movie over here and we 're playing pretend , so i need you all to be quiet for a second so we can do this , ' " @entity2 told @entity0			2
" and they all hushed down , and we got to do the take			2
it was just kind of a magical moment with all these kids , ' ok , we 'll be quiet during our recess so you can do this			0
' " it 's moments like this where @entity1 weighs the pluses and minuses of his @entity17 fame			1
" not enough people recognize that there are really good ways which it hangs over you , " the actor said			2
" people want to see @entity17 as a bad thing , and actually , it 's not			1
" if you manage it in the wrong way , i 'm sure it could turn into a hindrance			0
but if you take the right attitude , then it could be the most amazing platform for a career that anybody could ever wish for , so i 'm just going to try to capitalize on that if i can			0
" the eighth and final film of the series , " @entity17 and the @entity63 , " came out over two years ago , but even before then , @entity1 started taking roles that he called " slightly off the beaten path			1
" he played the lead in " @entity67 " in the @entity68 and on @entity69 -- with full - frontal nudity			0
he returned to @entity69 in " @entity71 " -- singing and dancing			0
he did a horror film , " @entity74 , " where he portrayed an older man			2
and at the @entity76 , he was hard at work promoting three new films , including " @entity6 , " about the early days of the beat poets and a murder case that united them			1
in all three of those films , @entity1 had nude scenes , which served notice of his maturity , sparking stories about how he 's all grown up now			1
a brief history of young adult literature this , he noted , is something that keeps recurring whenever he , @entity90 or @entity91 do anything adult			0
" i see photos in ' the @entity94 , ' photos of @entity90 in a photo shoot , and it says , ' she 's a far cry from @entity99 as she shows she 's all grown up now ! ' she 's a 24 - year - old woman ! you wonder how long people can legitimately write that			0
basically , we all just have to look old and haggard , but then they 'll just write , ' oh , what happened to @entity17 ? where did he go ? ' you ca n't win			1
" as for his own " growing up " stories , " i 'm aware that it 's something people talk about a lot , " @entity1 said			1
" i was having this conversation with @entity113 ( his co-star in the forthcoming " @entity114 " ) , because you do a couple of these nude scenes , and you get labeled an exhibitionist , which is n't really fair , because you 're just doing what 's in the script			2
i 've done it three times now ( on film ) , so it 's not like it 's really a big deal anymore			2
" just to curb the enthusiasm over his nude scenes , @entity1 nixed one for the second season of his tv show , " @entity129 , " in which he plays the younger version of @entity132 's character			1
" i 'd already done nude scenes in the first season , in the bath and a couple of other moments , " @entity1 said , " but there was this one scene in the second season where somebody breaks into my bedroom at night and starts intimidating me			1
at one point , they were trying to make the young doctor more vulnerable , and they said , ' would you do it naked ? ' " initially , @entity1 said yes , because he likes to give writers and directors what they want , but then he had second thoughts , since the nudity was n't in the script			1
" i said , ' guys , if it 's not key to the scene , i do n't think i should , ' " he said			2
" it was one of those moments where i felt i could say that			0
' is it absolutely key for the young doctor in this scene ? ' " in that case , no. but for a later gay sex scene with another partner in " @entity6 , " yes			1
a little more innocent is his kissing scene with @entity2 in that film , which they hope wins @entity168 at the @entity168			1
" it 's a pretty great kiss , " @entity2 said			0
" it 's about a person who 's really in love with another person , and they are n't allowed to			0
they do n't feel comfortable expressing how they feel about each other			0
this is the one moment where they let their guards down and finally get to embrace their love for the other person			0
" at the crux of the film , @entity183 ( played by @entity1 ) falls for @entity186 ( played by @entity2 ) , who is attempting to discard past lover -- or stalker , depending on your interpretation -- @entity186 ( played by @entity193 's @entity192 )			1
when @entity186 eventually kills @entity186 ( " i got to kill @entity193 ! " @entity2 laughed ) , his defense is that he was n't gay			2
" @entity195 was criminalized at the time , " @entity2 said , " and it was almost like , if you felt you were being pursued in a way you did n't want to be pursued , and if you killed him in self - defense , then you could pretty much get away with murder			0
" before the killing , @entity186 had enlisted @entity183 to create a sort of manifesto , and it 's out of this relationship that the writer in him is born			1
" i think most creative people like @entity183 basically veer between ambition and anxiety , between self - doubt and confidence , " @entity1 said			1
" i definitely can relate to that , even if i do n't have the extremes of confidence he has			0
he was calling himself a genius in his diary , at the age 14 ! i would never have said that about myself , even to myself			0
but we all go through that , ' am i doing the right thing ? is this what i meant to be doing ? ' hopefully in less extreme ways and not under the magnifying glass of a murder investigation			0
" @entity1 's own crisis of conscience came when he wondered if he 'd be able to continue to grow as an actor			1
" i felt like i had been learning a lot through ' @entity17 , ' and then it sort of plateaued at the end , " he said			1
but now he feels he 's proving to himself and everyone else that he 's right where he belongs , making the kinds of " weird , quirky " projects that he enjoys , learns from and perhaps could n't have been made without his participation			0
on top of all that , he actually gets to make new friends			0
( he 'd like to set up a competitive @entity243 game between @entity244 and @entity2 , " which would be pretty awesome " )			0
" there 's no pressure to do a big franchise or a big blockbuster , " @entity1 said			2
" but if i said to you now that i do n't want to do any action movies , tomorrow i 'll get the best action script i 've ever read			0
but i 'm not going to be jumping into any young adult fantasy series anytime soon , obviously ! " " @entity6 " opens in @entity254 and @entity255 on wednesday .			2
