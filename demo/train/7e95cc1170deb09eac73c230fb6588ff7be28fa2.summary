@entity0 , @entity1 -- when president @entity4 took the stage thursday night , he was n't just competing with the ghosts of conventions present , but with @entity10 's performance last week , @entity8 's wednesday , and the first lady 's on tuesday			1
he had to take on the ghosts of conventions past : comparisons with his stadium acceptance speech four years ago , and the 2004 speech that launched him into the national spotlight			1
those would be tough performances to match in any year -- near - impossible under current circumstances			2
so he did n't even try : a good deal of the speech came across a bit like a @entity22 address with fewer republicans and better lighting			1
but there were a few marks he had to hit -- and did			0
he had to acknowledge that things are n't rosy : " the first time i addressed this convention in 2004 , i was a younger man ; a @entity31 candidate from @entity32 who spoke about hope -- not blind optimism or wishful thinking , but hope in the face of difficulty ; hope in the face of uncertainty ; that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward , even when the odds are great ; even when the road is long ... " four years later : are you better off ? if you 're keeping score , that 's at least four references to struggle -- difficulty , uncertainty , great odds , a long road -- in a single sentence			1
" eight years later , that hope has been tested -- by the cost of war ; by one of the worst economic crises in history ; and by political gridlock that 's left us wondering whether it 's still possible to tackle the challenges of our time			0
" ... i recognize that times have changed since i first spoke to this convention			1
the times have changed -- and so have i. " opinion : how did president @entity4 do ? but he had to paint a plausible picture of rosier times down the road -- offer a concrete path forward , and give skeptical voters the feeling that the next four years could be different than the first : " but know this , @entity81 : our problems can be solved			1
our challenges can be met			0
the path we offer may be harder , but it leads to a better place			2
and i 'm asking you to choose that future			0
... " " ( a ) s i stand here tonight , i have never been more hopeful about @entity81 ...			0
" " i 'm hopeful because of you			0
" and there were roughly a dozen more references to hope scattered through the speech			2
hitting the right notes : he had to hit the bipartisan notes that the incredibly vanishing swing voters still tell pollsters they 're looking for			0
opinion : we 're in for a heck of a ride " last summer , i worked with @entity103 in @entity104 to cut $ 1 trillion in spending " now , i 'm still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission			0
no party has a monopoly on wisdom			0
no democracy works without compromise			0
" absent were direct references to the stimulus or @entity4 's health care plan -- both partisan flashpoints that still get mixed reviews from voters in most opinion polls			1
drawing contrasts : but he had to draw a sharp contrast with republicans on issues where he 's got public opinion on his side , like tax cuts for the wealthy			0
opinion : @entity4 speaks to @entity81 as adults " but when governor @entity10 and his allies in @entity104 tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy -- well , you do the math. i refuse to go along with that			1
and as long as i 'm president , i never will			2
" of course , there may be a pretty short shelf life on the political impact of anything he had to say thursday			0
when president @entity4 spoke , he was probably the only person in the arena who knew what the job numbers coming out first thing the next morning would be : a healthy showing that could turbo - charge any convention bounce - or a disappointing showing that could short - circuit it			1
" @entity81 , i never said this journey would be easy , and i wo n't promise that now , " he said , at the tail end of a speech that put a spotlight on struggle			1
" yes , our path is harder -- but it leads to a better place			2
" @entity4 urges voters to secure the change he started			1

president @entity4 had a high *bar* after recent *dramatic* speeches
convention speech acknowledges things are n't rosy in the country
he points to better times ahead and *suggests* a path to get there
