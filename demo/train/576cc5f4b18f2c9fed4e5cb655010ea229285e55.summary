maybe she meant to , maybe she did n't , but @entity1 reached straight for the encyclopedia of things losing candidates say			1
the @entity6 senator — an 18 - year @entity7 veteran and outgoing chairwoman of the @entity9 , blessed with one of the most recognizable last names in southern politics — stepped away from a modest crowd of supporters at a campaign event here for an interview about her difficult runoff race against @entity20 @entity19			1
" it 's not over until it 's over , " @entity1 said of the campaign , which has been left for dead by national @entity22			1
" the only poll that counts is @entity26			2
" a few of the reporters and political types standing nearby exchanged knowing glances			2
@entity1 's defeat gives @entity20 ninth seat this cycle as defined by political analyst @entity35 , who curated the definitive list of " things losing candidates say " for @entity39 last year , the luckless phrase is a pretty good indicator that " you are losing the race at the time and have no empirical evidence to the contrary			1
" the evidence was stacked against @entity1 , who advanced to the runoff after losing a strategic bet that she would win @entity6 's non-partisan primary outright four weeks ago			1
instead , she got 42 percent , far short of the 50.1 % needed to win , and voters are now consolidating around @entity19			1
if @entity1 had pulled it out saturday , it would be have been an epic fourth quarter miracle that would put @entity52 to shame			1
she would have had to keep @entity55 - @entity54 turnout on par with the november primary , and somehow find a way to increase her support among white voters from the dreadful 18 percent she received last month , all in the middle of the holiday season			2
it was a near - impossible lift			2
there has n't been a gold standard poll of the race , but she was losing by 15 or 20 points depending on the survey			1
the actions of national @entity22 were an even better tell			2
the @entity71 canceled its ad reservations for the runoff after @entity1 failed to win the nov. 4 jungle primary outright , effectively ceding the airwaves to @entity19 and @entity20 , who are outspending her 7 - 1 on television			1
supporters put on a brave face			1
" @entity1 has always had close races and she always pulled them out , " said @entity80 , a state representative and funeral director from @entity82			1
" a lot of us are counting on that happening one more time			2
" politically speaking , @entity6 is a weird place			0
they have elections in odd years and run " jungle primaries			0
" politicians , state and local , genuflect before the gods of the oil and gas industry			0
it 's a state that 's twice voted an @entity94 into the governor 's office ( @entity97 ) and seems primed to succeed him with a @entity20 who reportedly liked to wear diapers while soliciting a prostitute in the @entity102 ( @entity103 )			1
there 's a proud populist streak , a fraught racial history and a healthy dash of corruption			2
" @entity6 politics is of an intensity and complexity that are matched , in my experience , only in the @entity114 , " @entity109 once wrote about the state			0
he was referring to the strange gumbo coalitions — white , black , cajun , redneck , uptown , downtown — that candidates assembled to win statewide elections			0
but @entity121 was scribbling those thoughts for @entity123 in 1960			0
these days , elections are nationalized , waged on television and online , and not even the most @entity127 of @entity128 can safely count on surviving at the ballot box — no matter how much clout one has built up in @entity7 or how many @entity132 tailgates one attends			0
@entity20 have clobbered @entity1 with television ads tying her to president @entity134 , whose approval rating in @entity6 , according to midterm exit polls , is 39 percent			1
" the @entity20 and her opponent @entity19 have done a very effective job at creating an emotional target for voters to direct their frustration towards , and that would be president @entity134 , " said @entity138 - based @entity71 pollster @entity137			1
@entity1 , first elected in 1996 , compared herself to @entity147 quarterback @entity146 and @entity19 to an unknown rookie			1
voting her out of office , she argues , would be akin to benching the star quarterback when the team needs it most			0
the argument , though , had lost its resonance with @entity134 's waning popularity and the newly - in - charge @entity20 @entity9 majority , depriving @entity1 of her coveted position as chairwoman of the @entity9			1
" seniority is based on how many years you have served , " she said			0
i will have served 18 years			0
i have served with @entity22 in charge , i have served with republicans in charge			0
nothing can take my seniority away			0
i will still be one of the highest ranking members of the @entity9			0
i wo n't be chair			0
but i will be ranking member of the @entity9 , and in that i will convene meetings of @entity22 on @entity9 , so @entity128 will still be at forefront , at the leadership table			0
i will still be part of the leadership team			0
that 's much better than sitting on the back bench or sitting on the rookie bench			2
" @entity1 spent the final week flogging @entity19 , a congressman and @entity132 physician , over a late - breaking news story about questionable paychecks he received for part - time medical teaching work he may or may not have done at the university in @entity182			1
" this story has legs , " @entity1 said			1
" this story is breaking			0
you know , i wish it had broken a couple of weeks ago , but you know what ? it broke now			0
@entity19 can not say , ' i am a doctor , i am higher than the law			1
' " the argument felt like a @entity1 , the last gasp of a zombie campaign that many democrats are waiting for to die in a canebrake			1
and even the senator admits how difficult it is to run a campaign when no one , in @entity6 or elsewhere , seems to be listening anymore			0
" nothing seems to be breaking through these days , " she said with a sigh , deviating slightly from her message			0
" it 's a very strange situation , all over the country			2
it 's like people are just so mad , these commercials have really gotten people 's emotions up			2
so getting people to focus on what really matters , leadership , honesty , integrity , hard work ... " @entity1 trailed off			1
" i am not going to give up , " she said			0
" these last few days are really important			0

sen. @entity1 lost her runoff race to @entity20 *challenger* @entity19 on saturday
@entity1 's supporters put on a brave face until the end
