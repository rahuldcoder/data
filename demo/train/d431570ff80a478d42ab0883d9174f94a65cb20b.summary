seriously people , is there something about snow storms that makes us want to eat @entity7 toast and sit on the toilet ? with every predicted blizzard , there 's a mad dash to load up on milk , bread , eggs and toilet paper			1
but why those particular items ? sure , there are some variations including booze , snack foods and even ice cream			1
yet these items are the first to disappear from store shelves when the dreaded " snow " word is mentioned			1
are you in the storm 's path ? please share your images if you can do so safely			1
according to @entity32 , we might be able to thank a particular region for at least some of it			1
" it appears that @entity37 can take credit for the purchasing of milk and bread prior to the storm , " the site reported on its site			1
" it was the monumental blizzard in 1978 that trapped many in homes for weeks that gets at least some credit for the current tradition			0
in november 2014 , writer @entity49 set out to unravel the mystery for @entity51			1
what she found was that during one of that city 's worst snowstorms , which began on november 24 , 1950 , an article in a local newspapers referenced milk as " the one shortage that has hit all sections " and bread as being " doled out in some stores " because of a storm that ultimately brought almost 3 feet of snow			2
as for the toilet paper ? @entity49 had a theory that a line in the story referring to folks being advised to make sure they cooperated by " buying what they need			0
" " i do n't know about you , but when i 'm listing the things we need , if we 're going to be snowed in for the next few days , toilet paper is damn sure going to be one of them , " she wrote			2
it does n't appear to make much sense given that one of the major problems in many storms is the loss of power			0
and that 's a bad thing when it comes to keeping milk and eggs fresh , though @entity89 could lend a hand if said items are simply placed in the snow			2
eat this list : 5 things to cook up when it 's cold out the need to stock up on perishables has led to some creativity			0
there 's the @entity100 which according to its site " has been developed in consultation with local and federal emergency officials to help you determine when to panic and rush to the store to buy milk , eggs and bread			2
" the site rates storms from low to severe and on sunday their @entity112 account sounded the alarm for its followers			0
in 2013 comedian @entity115 released a @entity116 of his song " @entity120 " in which he poked fun at the tradition			0
on monday social media was filled with evidence that people were staying true to form in their buying habits			0
just know that in a few months it will be hurricane season in some parts of the country and folks will once again be scrambling for -- you guessed it -- milk , bread , and toilet paper .			0

there are some items people rush for prior to a storm
@entity32 says @entity37 may be to blame
