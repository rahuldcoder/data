-- it was obvious that @entity3 owner @entity2 did n't like his organization 's integrity being questioned			1
on monday , he sat down ( did n't use a lectern ) to talk with sports reporters about last week 's @entity9 report that implied the @entity3 ' top brass knew early on how bad the @entity12 domestic violence case was and the team tried to influence @entity14 to give the running back a light penalty			1
while denying that was the case , @entity2 did admit again that he and the team should have done more to get the video that led to @entity12 being axed by his @entity3 and suspended by the @entity19			1
@entity2 spoke for 47 minutes , at one point telling a media relations person who wanted to end the news conference that it was ok to keep going			0
here are five key points we learned from the owner 's candid discussion and the letter to fans that the @entity3 issued tackling 15 points from the @entity9 report that it disputed			1
who were the sources for the story ? @entity2 told reporters that he believed @entity12 's people were most of the unnamed sources for the story as part of their attempt to get his indefinite suspension overturned			1
" almost everything in ( the article ) is anonymous but it 's clear from the subject matter it 's @entity12 's attorney , @entity12 's agent and @entity12 's friends			2
they are building a case for reinstatement and the best way to build a case for reinstatement is to make everyone else look like they 're lying			0
" the @entity3 owner said he wished the reporters for @entity9 -- which issued a statement : " we stand by our reporting " -- had acknowledged to readers how big a role @entity12 's camp played in the story			1
in its report it said : " ' @entity67 ' interviewed more than 20 sources ... team officials , current and former league officials , @entity72 representatives and associates , advisers and friends of @entity12			1
" @entity2 claimed some of those friends " started making things up			0
" @entity9 investigative reporter @entity79 appeared on " @entity67 " after @entity2 made his claims and said they were false			2
" it 's an assumption he 's making ... but it 's unfortunately just not true , " he said			0
when did the @entity3 know what was on the in - elevator video ? it 's the damning piece of evidence that got @entity12 fired and suspended indefinitely			1
he is appealing through the players ' union			0
the video from inside the elevator at a @entity94 casino shows @entity12 in the early morning hours of february 15 knocking out his future wife with a vicious punch to the head			1
@entity98 posted what it says was a cleaned up version of the recording			0
@entity9 reported that @entity3 director of security @entity102 knew within hours of the incident what was on the video , through a report given to him by a police officer in @entity108			1
this conflicts with what the @entity3 have said about when they knew what was on the video			2
through the team 's statement , @entity102 said it was 10 days later when a police official described the video			1
" the officer could not tell from the video whether @entity12 slapped or punched her , but @entity12 told me very clearly that he did not punch her , " @entity102 said , without elaborating when @entity12 described the incident to him			2
the @entity3 stopped pursuing the video when the charge against @entity12 was elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony			1
@entity2 said it was a mistake to defer to prosecutors investigating the case and that at some point the @entity3 should have demanded the video from @entity12 's attorney			1
what did @entity12 say happened ? it 's a key point of contention			2
@entity9 cited sources in this report and another that @entity12 told the @entity3 and @entity19 officials that he punched @entity134 , his fiancee whom he married a month after the incident			1
@entity19 commissioner @entity14 has said his original two - game suspension of @entity12 was in part based on the player 's misleading testimony during a june meeting			2
the @entity3 also said @entity12 was n't forthcoming			2
" it was our understanding based on @entity12 's account that in the course of a physical altercation between the two of them he slapped @entity134 with an open hand , and that she hit her head against the elevator rail or wall as she fell to the ground , " @entity2 said in the team statement			1
@entity102 said @entity12 denied punching his fiancee			0
@entity3 general manager @entity155 was quoted in the @entity156 that the video showed that @entity12 did n't lie to him			1
he said monday that he had only asked @entity158 if he had hit @entity134 and @entity12 said he had			0
" i later said @entity12 did n't lie to me because he told me he hit her , and that is what the video later showed -- although the video was much more violent than what i had pictured , " he said in the @entity3 ' release			1
did the @entity3 ask prosecutors and the @entity19 to go easy ? team president @entity167 said that @entity102 was the only person from the team to make contact with anyone in the @entity94 judicial or law enforcement investigations			0
the only thing anyone from the team did outside of requesting the video was to write a letter in support of @entity12 that was included in his application for a pretrial intervention program			2
@entity2 was upset by the implication that he and @entity14 are buddies who share a love for golf and that the owner used a connection to ask for a favor			0
" i know and like @entity14 , but it is inaccurate to call us ' good friends , ' " he said in the statement			0
the owner said his communication with the commissioner consisted of a brief conversation at an owners ' meeting			0
" one time i saw @entity14 at the @entity19 meetings , and i said , ' where are we with this ? ' and he said , ' nowhere until the police investigation is concluded			0
' that 's the extent of what i did at that time , " @entity2 said			0
could @entity12 rejoin the @entity3 ? yes , but not on the field , @entity2 told reporters			1
he talked about text messages he sent to @entity158 on the day the @entity3 let him go : hey @entity12 , just want to let you know , we loved you as a player , it was great having you here			2
hopefully all these things are going to die down			0
i wish the best for you and @entity134			0
when you 're done with football , i 'd like you to know you have a job waiting for you with the @entity3 helping young guys getting acclimated to the league			0
the @entity9 report indicated @entity12 thought the job offer was a bid to have @entity12 go along with the @entity3 ' version of events			1
@entity2 said it was an honest attempt to bring back a player he thought would have a retribution story to share with young players			0
" people that redeem themselves are the best ones to lead others , " he said			0
" i believed that this was @entity12 's one terrible moment			0
" @entity2 said he believed that @entity12 would be a " great asset " counseling with rookies and telling his story of personal redemption .			2

@entity3 owner thinks its obvious most unnamed sources were sympathetic to @entity12
@entity9 denies his *allegation* , says it stands by its reporting
team 's director of security denies knowing within hours what was on in - elevator video
@entity2 feels @entity12 could return to team after playing *career* ends
