-- fifteen years ago , representatives from every nation came together to voice one common goal : to advance the global status of women in the spirit of equality			1
we were there in @entity10 , @entity11 , when women broke their silence and a resounding message burst forth from the walls of the @entity16 : no longer would it be acceptable to separate women 's rights from human rights			1
today , we are seeing a powerful momentum materialize as women in diverse regions raise their voices to claim their rights and inspire change while leading neighborhoods , villages , parliaments and nations forward			1
as the world navigates through an unprecedented financial crisis , economists and leaders are increasingly turning their attention to the greatest untapped reserve of innovation and resilience -- women			0
progress on women 's equality is reaching different regions at different paces , but we can see improvement in girls ' education , workforce participation and political representation			1
the global net rate of primary school enrollment for girls is up to 89 percent ; the number of women holding nonagricultural , paid jobs continues to increase worldwide ; and women 's global share of parliamentary seats is rising , now at 18.4 percent			2
something much harder to measure , but maybe the most significant of all indicators , is a widespread shift over the past 15 years in the global conversation about women			1
our campaign for equality has come out from the darkness of the periphery			0
we are moving into an age that enables progress and an environment that sustains it			0
for @entity73 , the light of change is an unsteady flicker			0
in her home in rural @entity78 , @entity79 , women who are abused or raped are cast out of their homes ; the concept of women 's rights is as novel as it is dangerous			1
she was beaten for raising her voice in dissent , kicked to the ground for promoting a woman 's right to live free of violence			1
out of injustice that sought to tear her down , she emerged as a courageous voice of change			0
@entity73 formed @entity94 , a cooperative where once - forsaken survivors of violence find healing and independence as artisans who produce vibrant jewelry			0
@entity102 is one voice among the millions threatened by a global increase in violence against women -- one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime			2
we are confronted with a pandemic of violence , and must address it with commensurate force and urgency			0
@entity73 carries the weight of unrealized human rights on her shoulders			0
it is our duty to help lessen her load			0
we must support women like her as equal partners in economic , social and political development , and recognize their ability to practice collaborative leadership and carry their communities forward with each step they take			0
recently we honored @entity73 at the 2010 @entity132 , recognizing her strength and vision as she empowers women and shapes a future free of violence against women			2
if we want to promote peace and prosperity , we must begin with women			1
we have seen that in societies where women 's rights are respected , economies are stronger , civil societies thrive and political institutions are more open and free			2
our progress in the past 15 years is tenuous if it 's not shared , reinforced and expanded in all spheres			1
we must recommit ourselves to women 's equality worldwide			2
now is the time to build on the momentum and advance positive change			0
