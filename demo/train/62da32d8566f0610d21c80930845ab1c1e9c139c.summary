-- @entity1 , an @entity3 plus - size model , is getting a cyber-standing ovation for posting unretouched and makeup - free photos of herself on @entity6 in protest against the pathological airbrushing we 've grown accustomed to in professional photography			1
it 's a bold move for the 25 - year - old , who was also a vocal critic of the recent sports illustrated swimsuit issue			1
her message to women everywhere is clear : beauty comes in many sizes			1
the problem is , @entity1 is not what average people would call plus - size			1
in fact , when i initially saw her unretouched photos , i kept scrolling through the gallery looking for her unretouched photos			2
her natural beauty is undeniable , but if her body is what the fashion industry is calling plus size , that world is more screwed up than we know			2
like , seriously , what kind of hallucinogen do you have to take in order to look at @entity1 and think she 's on the heavier side ? at worst she looks like a fitness instructor at one of those gyms where the women show up in full makeup			1
i 've been to @entity3			0
there are plus - size women there			1
@entity1 , for all of her bravery , should not be considered among them			2
it 's the body image distortion that crammed her into that category , which , for actual plus - size women , ca n't be a good thing			1
if a size 6 , or even 8 , 9 , or 10 , is the industry 's idea of a plus - size woman , then how should the average @entity55 woman -- who weighs roughly 165 pounds and wears size 12 or 14 -- describe herself ? morbidly obese ? of course not , which is why size designations have been massaged over time			1
many women apparently do n't want to know their true size , so what was a size 14 or 16 in the 1950s is an 8 today			2
@entity68 , they call it			0
this ridiculous shell game is how @entity1 , who is a size 12 , can be both a plus - size role model and on the thin side of average at the same time			1
and while this sickeningly unrealistic idea of what we should look like is something mainly inflicted on women , men are not immune			2
the receding hairline of @entity82 's prince @entity81 was infamously resurrected as an issue on a 2010 cover of @entity85			0
tennis great @entity87 's arm grew by 10 inches for his 2007 @entity90 cover			0
@entity91 compiled a hilarious gallery of photoshopped male celebrities like @entity94 next to pictures of how they actually look			0
earlier this year male model @entity98 , talking about photo enhancement , said , " why would you watch a movie without special effects ? you understand that this is n't real			0
there 's @entity104 in magazines and special effects in movies			0
i mean , it happens			0
so accept it and know that this is actually a real person underneath all of the computerized effects that they 're adding in			0
" are we really ready to take a look at ' real women ' ? fair enough			0
but then recall the fat - shaming of prince @entity118 after he posed nude in @entity120 's @entity119			2
or notice such things as the increase in steroid use among young men ; global sales of male toiletries other than shaving products surpassing purchase of shaving products for the first time ; and popularity of the painful sounding " @entity133 " waxes			0
that 's when you see it 's not just women who are spending money and risking their health to try to look like a picture in a magazine			0
so , while it 's puzzling that @entity1 is considered plus - size , i guess we can say good for her for putting herself out there a bit			1
in an industry with such crazy ideas about what 's fat , it 's brave , i suppose , to put on a bikini and publish an unedited photo			1
hopefully the attention she draws will shed light on how stupid it is to listen an industry that labeled her plus - size / fat in the first place .			1

@entity163 : " plus - size " model gets *cyberapplause* for posting unretouched *pix*
@entity167 : if she 's " plus - size , " it 's *bad* news for average women , who run about 165 pounds
he says @entity55 's distorted views of beauty , appearance affect women and men
@entity167 : maybe @entity1 's brave photos will raise awareness of how crazy our beauty image is
