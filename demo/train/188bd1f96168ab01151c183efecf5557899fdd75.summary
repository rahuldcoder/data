@entity0 -- @entity2 , a 46 - year - old father , is still afraid to tell his mother about the woman nearly 25 years his senior who used to sneak into his room at night and crawl into his bed			1
he does n't want her to feel guilty			1
she was his mom 's best friend			1
" she would get into my bed naked			1
make me take off my clothes and make me touch her			1
then , she 'd touch me			1
we would masturbate and ... do stuff , " says @entity2 , pausing to recall what happened so long ago			1
" it went on for a long time			1
she said it was our secret			2
that 's how i learned about sex			2
" he was 10 years old when the abuse began			1
" after her , i got my girlfriend pregnant a few years later			2
i do n't know ... maybe that 's why i 'm so messed up now			2
i have problems with relationships			2
" until the @entity30 child rape case took over our national conversation , @entity2 ( all names have been changed at the request of the interview subjects ) had never told his story			1
he was n't even sure he 'd been abused			1
no doubt he 'd feel very differently if he were talking about his 10 - year - old daughter lying in bed with a 35 - year - old man			2
according to national studies , one in every six boys are sexually abused before the age of 16			1
and yes , the majority of pedophiles are men , but as much as 40 % of sexual abuse is perpetrated by women			1
@entity2 's story is not unusual			2
it is unusual that he 's talking about it			2
for many reasons , experts say , men face different feelings of shame and guilt than women experience when reporting childhood sexual abuse			1
men do n't want to be viewed as weaklings for allowing the abuse			1
they worry that their sexuality will be questioned if the abuser was another man			2
and in cases like @entity2 's where the pedophile was a woman , men may even feel societal pressure to brag about the early unwanted sexual activity			1
either way , the long - term mental effects can be devastating			2
@entity76 : no matter the gender , rape is rape boys who are sexually exploited can have problems later with anger , self - loathing and drinking			1
they often live recklessly and have intimacy problems , among other serious long - term issues , says @entity86 , a psychotherapist with more than 25 years ' experience			2
as a mother of a teenage son and @entity30 alum , i am struggling to grasp the horrific details surrounding the @entity30 case			1
@entity94 , 67 , a former @entity30 assistant coach , faces 40 criminal charges in the alleged rape and sexual abuse of eight boys over a 15 - year period			1
but as the disturbing story unfolds , i have begun to notice the beginning of something very positive			2
grown men are talking openly about abuse they experienced as boys			1
men are beginning to heal			1
across my neighborhood , friends and families are sharing their painful secrets over kitchen tables -- and often a glass of wine -- without the fear of ridicule or shame men often face around this topic			1
sports have always been a safe conversation			2
abuse experts say that men under - report these childhood incidents when they are called " abuse , " but when they are asked about " unwanted sexual experiences , " the numbers may be higher than one in six			1
not surprising in a world where men are not supposed to be victims , even as little boys			1
for @entity133 , it was his priest			2
a huge football fan and happily married father of three , @entity133 says the @entity30 story hurts			1
he grew up in the @entity137 and was an altar boy			0
he was 9 years old , he says , when his priest began being nice to him , giving him special assignments around the church and making him feel special			0
" i would stay after and help clean up the church , " he says , nearly tearing as he remembers			0
but then , the touching started , he says , the wrestling , the horseplay -- words consistently used by @entity94 's alleged victims			0
" one night , we were wrestling and the priest pinned me underneath him			0
he grabbed my genitals and started rubbing me there			0
i did n't know what to do , " @entity133 says			0
" but somehow , i got out of his grip			0
i think i may have hit him and i ran home crying			0
" but when @entity133 got home and told his mother what the priest had done , she did n't believe him			0
the priest was beloved in their community			0
@entity133 got into trouble for telling lies			0
it 's not uncommon for parents to be in denial , and feel guilt or anger at a child , when first hearing of abuse , experts say			1
one of the most upsetting things about the @entity30 story is it appears that so many adults knew about the abuse allegations , as far back as 1998 , but kept silent , in order to save the reputation of the university 's football program			1
those people should all go to prison			0
i 'm hopeful that these are different days from when @entity2 and @entity133 grew up			0
and at least one boy i know thinks so			0
his family is planning a big party , he says , a reward for getting @entity196 's in school this year			0
it 's taken a lot of hard work and counseling to get @entity192 to this happy place			0
@entity192 was 7 when his father introduced him to hardcore pornography			0
" i did n't know what it was , but i knew it was bad			0
@entity209 said not to tell @entity210 , " he told me the other day			0
his father said he would beat him if he told anyone			0
as @entity192 started to have trouble in school and became moody at home , his mother worried			0
she did n't know what was wrong			0
" it took him years to tell me about what was going on with his father , " she says			0
when i asked @entity192 how he found the courage to tell , he says easily : " @entity210 always said not to lie			0
i was scared @entity209 would be mad , but i was more scared of keeping a secret			0
" after @entity192 told about the porn sessions , his father left the family and never came back			0
" i miss him , " @entity192 says quietly			0
but he knows he made the right decision and has a message for boys who feel they have been violated in any way : " if something bad happens to you and the person tells you not to tell , you should definitely tell right away			1
tell a parent or the cops			0
" i 'm wishing @entity192 a very happy birthday			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1
