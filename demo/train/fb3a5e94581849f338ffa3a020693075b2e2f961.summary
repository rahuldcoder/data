the all - time high for @entity2 gas prices was $ 4.11 on july 11 , 2008 , she said			1
the drop " comes from the crude oil price slump earlier this month , " @entity6 said , " and it looks like there 's perhaps another dime drop at the pump in the next few days			2
" however , whether the drop is more or less than a dime depends on several factors , including what crude oil prices do next and whether flooding in the @entity31 , which has caused transport delays , does not worsen , she said			0
asked whether crude oil prices may rise again , @entity6 said , " it certainly is possible at any time			0
