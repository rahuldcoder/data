-- ok , i admit it : @entity3 was my first dream crush			1
mind you , i did n't fall in love right away			2
because , after all , when " the @entity7 " premiered in 1955 , i was barely out of diapers			1
( and as @entity11 reminded us in " @entity13 , " " even @entity9 speaks of a latency period ! " ) but when the five - day - a - week series went into syndicated reruns in the early ' 60s , i was a goner the first time i tuned in			1
like millions of other guys my age at the time , i fell in love with that vivacious young beauty with the bright , beaming smile			1
and , as the show continued , the conspicuously blossoming , ahem , womanliness			0
of course , there were other attractive ladies on the airwaves			0
there was @entity29 flitting about in capri pants throughout various episodes of " the @entity32			0
" and while some of us could n't understand quite why @entity35 ( @entity36 ) was so attentive to @entity37 ( @entity38 ) on " @entity39 " -- we could n't help paying attention to her , too			0
but those and other prime - time persons of interest were women			2
( like -- yikes ! -- our moms			0
she was our age , or close enough			0
and we could n't get enough of her			0
unfortunately , there never was enough			0
@entity48 novelist and critic @entity49 was right : the past really is a foreign country -- and , man , we did things very differently there			0
in the early to mid- 1960s , an era before cable , videocassettes , dvds and the @entity58 , if you wanted to follow a star , well , you had just so many opportunities for star sightings			2
you missed " the @entity7 " -- and @entity3 -- on friday ? sorry , bud : you had to wait until monday for another glimpse			1
and even later , when @entity3 branched out into movies -- you actually had to leave home and go to a movie theater to see her			1
if you are a guy of a certain age , you kinda grew up with @entity3			1
you started paying attention to her on " the @entity7 " at roughly the same time you started paying attention to girls your own age			1
and when she starred in " @entity72 " -- which begat " @entity73 , " then " @entity77 " and " @entity78 " and " @entity79 " and on and on -- the time was just right for you to respond to a silly popcorn comedy filled with bubblegum pop tunes and bikini - clad cuties every bit as avidly as moviegoers of a later generation might respond to movies about hunky werewolves and sparkly vampires			2
of course , if you were a guy of a certain age at a certain time -- hey , you had to hide your love away			0
if your buddies wanted to know why you needed to cut short a baseball game or wanted to change the channel from " @entity93 " to watch " the @entity7 , " you could n't very well tell them the truth			1
you had to say : " oh , i 'm following that ' @entity97 ' serial			0
" or , " man , have n't you been keeping up with ' @entity98 ' ? " you never had to make a similar excuse to any girl you might be dating			0
and the beauty part was : girls were never jealous of @entity3			1
why ? because most of them would admit that they wanted to be @entity3			1
they had 45s of all her hit singles -- " @entity109 , " " @entity110 , " etc. -- and they really appreciated that you never complained when they played them over and over again			0
@entity3 represented an all - american ideal of perky , spunky , mid- ' 60s sexuality -- nonthreatening , effervescent , even wholesome			1
( she may be the only actress in the history of showbiz to look demurely @entity118 - rated even while wearing a bikini			2
compared to her , even @entity120 in " @entity121 " looked hot to trot			0
) and while i normally detest the cliche of referring to this or that fallen star as emblematic of " a more innocent age , " @entity3 serves as a reminder that , sometimes , " cliche " can be shorthand for " undeniable truth			1
" @entity3 's career fell into decline , alas , as relatively innocent trifles such as " @entity79 " were edged out of theaters by the likes of " @entity136 " and " @entity137 , " as the much - sought " youth audience " started demanding less homogenized and more realistic depictions of teen and twenty - something life in feature films			1
and as kid - skewing shows such as " the @entity7 " were supplanted in late - afternoon tv schedules by syndicated chat - shows featuring @entity146 and @entity147			1
to her credit , @entity3 retained her dignity and remained relatively active long after her heyday passed			1
in fact , her post- ' 60s career path might serve as a game plan for contemporary teen phenoms , including a few who got their first break on @entity158 series			2
and even as her visibility was limited to a tv guest spot here or a nostalgia - drenched spoof there ( she and @entity160 reteamed in 1987 for " @entity167 , " a box - office underachiever ) , her fans continued to hold a soft place in their hearts for her			2
we were saddened and sympathetic when we learned of her battle with multiple sclerosis			0
and monday , as reports of her passing circulate , we mourn her passing			2
and yes : quite a few of us bid a fond farewell to a first sweetheart			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181			0

@entity183 : @entity3 , who died monday , was the first crush of millions of boys
they pretty much grew up with her , through @entity7 and " @entity190 " flicks , he says
he says boys had to feign *disinterest* in " @entity7 " with buddies
@entity3 embodied an all - american ideal of wholesome , perky , spunky mid- ' 60s sexuality
