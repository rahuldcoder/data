-- " the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice			1
" -- @entity4 why so long ? as i watched the announcement by attorney general @entity7 this past week in @entity8 -- that federal prosecutors would no longer invoke mandatory minimum sentencing laws for certain low - level , nonviolent drug offenders -- i kept asking myself : " why so long ? " pardon me if i am underwhelmed by the sudden turnaround , especially in light of the evidence having been overwhelming for the past 40 years that we have been on the wrong path			1
these mandatory minimums were a bad idea when they were first proposed			1
not because i say so , but because the evidence leads to almost no other conclusion			0
i came of age during @entity26 's crack epidemic and i have seen the results of this scourge on our society in my own family , where family members have suffered , their lives affected and dreams shattered			1
but putting them on lockdown because a judge had no discretion whatsoever was never the answer to any prayer			0
not for my family , not for the millions whose " lives have been wasted due to the drug war and the types of police tactics that have been deployed in the get - tough - on - crime movement , " as author and law professor @entity48 noted			1
as reported last week , amid the crack epidemic a generation ago , state and federal lawmakers had enacted a wave of tough crime measures that resulted in a nearly 800 % increase in the number of prisoners in the @entity26 , even as the population grew by only a third			1
the result ? an increase in the number of @entity64 and @entity65 men convicted of drug crimes , with black men about six times as likely as white men to be incarcerated			0
or in the vernacular we used back in the day when fighting against these discriminatory laws , " crack is used in the streets , cocaine in the suites			2
" and yet , one had to get caught with 100 times more powder cocaine than crack to get the same sentence			0
even in the @entity86 era , although president @entity86 initially campaigned on a one - to - one ratio in this area of sentencing , what he signed into law in 2010 was 18 - to - 1			2
better , but not nearly good enough			0
the attorney general chose the right place to make his announcement			0
in @entity98 the impact these draconian laws have had on prison overcrowding and related issues is front page news almost daily			2
the once " @entity107 " has been ordered to release nearly 10,000 inmates from its overcrowded prisons by the end of the year to resolve a problem of " cruel and unusual punishment " that 's been brewing for years due to , what else ? you guessed it , an overly aggressive increase in sentencing			2
so , with all of this data , why so long for this major shift on crime ? the answers are plentiful but the motive may be singular			1
i would like to believe that it 's about a shift in our morals ; that our nation has finally come to the conclusion that being the world 's leader on lockdowns is neither socially sustainable nor a just way to treat fellow citizens			1
but , alas , i 'm not that naive			2
as a nation , we have a habit every bit as addictive as the habits of many of the folk we 've locked away			0
we 've been addicted to the drug of incarceration , and now we can no longer afford our expensive habit			1
things are " breaking bad " for us too			0
of course , like most addictions , this habit wo n't be easy to break			0
but let 's hope this time around we get the help we need and come to our senses about how to better spend our dollars			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			1

@entity153 : i 'm underwhelmed at @entity7 's decision to avert mandatory minimum sentences
what took so long ? such sentences have been a *disaster* from the beginning , he says
he says tough - on - crime laws made incarceration jump 800 % ; blacks , @entity167 bore brunt
@entity153 : why is @entity26 no longer willing to do this ? not morals , sadly -- it just got too expensive
