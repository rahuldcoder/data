-- @entity1 is not a driver to get unduly excited			1
so it is no surprise that @entity12 's " iceman " is playing down the significance of his @entity6 leading the timesheets in practice ahead of sunday 's @entity10			1
it continues what has been a promising start to the season for the @entity17 , who took the checkered flag at last weekend 's season opener in @entity20			1
the circuit : @entity0 's look at the @entity24 gp " look at this place : it is hot , it is humid and the track is completely different , " the 2007 world champion told @entity12 's official website as he downplayed his achievements in practice			1
" on top of this we could see rain at any point of the race , so how should i know what is happening on sunday afternoon ? " the only thing that i can say right here , right now is that the car is good , that the team is working fantastically and that i want to keep the lead in the drivers ' standings			0
let 's see where these factors will bring us in the race			2
" at the moment i would say that it is trial and error for all of us , and the more you are able to try , the more you have the chance to eliminate any errors			0
it looked good for us this afternoon , but it is friday so it does n't mean much			0
" close behind @entity1 was reigning triple world champion @entity56 , on a day which saw dry conditions in the morning and rain in the afternoon			1
the @entity61 driver recently spoke of his respect for @entity1 , who denied that his new found pace would affect their off - track relationship			1
" @entity66 is for me an honest guy -- and , yes , we get along very well , " explained @entity1			2
" what happens on the track and life outside the cockpit are two completely different pairs of shoes			0
" we are both professionals who can separate one from the other			0
i always wonder what people are expecting us to do ? that we are running with a knife through the paddock seeking revenge after a race incident , or what ? " @entity86 degradation @entity56 , who finished third in the first race of the season , admitted improvements are needed for the @entity61 car ahead of qualifying on saturday			1
" this afternoon we could n't do so much due to the weather , but this morning it looked ok , although the tyres do n't last very long ! " the 25 - year - old @entity92 said			0
" we need to try a couple of things now overnight to improve and take a step forward			0
" double world champion @entity99 was fourth fastest , edged out by his @entity101 teammate @entity100 who went third fastest at the @entity102			1
@entity103 's @entity99 won this race last year and he will be looking for the fourth victory of his career in @entity24			1
" today , the car worked well in all conditions and that is very good news for us , " explained @entity99			2
" now we must see how tomorrow goes , when it could rain at any moment and on a track where tyre degradation is much higher than in @entity116			0
" @entity117 was ninth fastest as he continues his integration into the @entity120 team following his switch from @entity122			1
" we made some positive steps with the set - up over the two sessions today , " explained the 2008 drivers ' champion			2
" i had a good long run in the dry which has given us a lot of information to look at tonight			0
" we did n't learn too much in the wet this afternoon however as the conditions were quite mixed when i went out			0
we focused mainly on longer runs today so i have n't done a quick lap yet on either set of tyres ; that will come tomorrow			0
