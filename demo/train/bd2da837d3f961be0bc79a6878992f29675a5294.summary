@entity0 did not feature in the contenders for the best player of the @entity3 despite scoring @entity5 's winning goal in the final , but the midfielder has been recognized for his country 's historic triumph at @entity10			1
the 28 - year - old @entity12 star is one of 10 @entity14 players in @entity16 's 23 - man squad , which features four from losing finalists @entity18			1
@entity0 , clubmates @entity19 and @entity20 plus @entity22 's @entity21 were included in a nine - strong midfield contingent , while @entity24 and @entity25 were named among five forwards despite playing in @entity5 's so - called " no striker " formation			1
the @entity14 completely nullified @entity18 's midfield general @entity29 in sunday 's final , winning 4 - 0 in @entity31 to clinch a third successive major title			1
@entity0 did not score and had just one assist , but was rewarded for his overall contribution to the merciless @entity14 passing machine			2
at the @entity3 , @entity35 was @entity5 's only entry in the top three as @entity39 's @entity38 was named best player			1
" @entity29 was magnificent and obviously circumstances did n't help him in the final , " @entity16 technical director @entity41 said			2
" @entity21 , @entity19 and @entity0 were all superb			0
in the case of @entity19 , he won the award last time , and he could easily have won the award again , but we felt that @entity0 deserved it			0
is this @entity5 team the best in football history ? " in many ways , he symbolized the tournament -- the creative , incisive runner , with and without the ball			2
we felt that he epitomized a lot of what we saw			0
" the squad included only two players not present in the semifinal matches : @entity62 captain @entity61 and @entity64 striker @entity63			0
" the players in the squad are those who have contributed in a significant way over the entire tournament , " said @entity41 , a former coach of @entity66 's national team			1
" inevitably , the squad is dominated by players from the teams who had the most success -- first of all the team which won the title , @entity5 , then those players who were in the other top three teams			1
" there are other players who could easily have been in the squad , but we restricted ourselves to a set number			0
the line was drawn at 23 because this was the squad size for the tournament			2
" @entity16 president @entity85 hailed the tournament in @entity87 and @entity88 as a big success , despite earlier fears of problems with racism which -- despite several incidents inside stadiums -- did not escalate as predicted			1
" this @entity97 , the first in the @entity99 , has been a resounding success , a real triumph , " the @entity95 said on @entity16 's website			1
" @entity87 and @entity88 showed the whole world that they can organize this type of event and that they need n't have any concerns			1
they can be proud of the work they 've done , their enthusiasm and the final results			0
i 'm proud of them , anyway			0
" @entity85 said the biggest on - pitch success of the tournament was the use of extra match officials behind the goal lines			2
" that was the principal innovation on the pitch compared to previous @entity97 editions , and the system of five referees was a real plus in terms of the football that got played : it helped get rid of simulation in the area and also helped significantly reduce shirt - pulling during set pieces , " he said			0
" in the end , there were more goals and , even more significantly , more headed goals in this @entity97 than in other big international competitions			0
the system of five referees acts as a deterrent and the quality of football benefits from that			0
" @entity16 also raised € 228,000 ( $ 285,000 ) for the charity center for @entity142 to @entity16 ( @entity143 ) after pledging € 3,000 for each of the 76 goals scored			0
off the field of play , @entity147 users set a new record for a sporting event on @entity152 during sunday 's final			1
the social networking site said its total global traffic peaked at 15,358 tweets per second when @entity156 scored @entity5 's fourth goal			1
