-- the " @entity1 " franchise is a perennial blockbuster , with more than 65 million units sold so far in the @entity5 and hordes of fans lining up each fall to buy the latest installment of the war - simulation video game			1
now , @entity10 will find out whether fans who are accustomed to dropping $ 60 on a new " @entity1 " game each year will also cough up an extra $ 50 to keep their game content fresh			1
the much - hyped " @entity1 : @entity15 " is set to arrive in stores on tuesday			1
as usual , players get inside the helmets of soldiers -- in this case , fighting a near - futuristic global war against @entity22 forces who have invaded multiple countries , including the @entity5			2
the storyline , with battles in @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , is a continuation of its 2009 predecessor			0
but " @entity15 " will be the first game in the series to launch with a new member service called " @entity35			1
" players will be able to sign up for a free social network that encapsulates the new game , last year 's " @entity39 " and future " @entity1 " games			1
they 'll be able to create a profile that extensively tracks gameplay statistics for multiple " @entity1 " games across the various console platforms for which they 're available			2
stat systems are typically maintained by console developers , like @entity48 and @entity49 , which means @entity51 gamers can not rank themselves against @entity53 players			2
the @entity35 service bridges that gap , although gamers still will not be able to play against someone using a different type of console			1
elite users will also be able to share videos or screen shots captured within the game and download " @entity1 " stat - tracking applications to their smartphones or tablets			1
@entity48 and @entity66 maintain a similar dedicated service for " @entity68			2
" despite competition this fall from fellow first - person shooter game " @entity70 , " which sold 5 million units in its first week , @entity10 is confident the " @entity1 " franchise has enough muscle to persuade customers to spend the $ 50 per year for premium services			1
" ' @entity1 ' is a franchise that 's grown every year of its existence , " @entity10 ceo @entity77 said in a recent interview			1
" i think that we are finding that people have a very healthy appetite for content			0
" subscribers will be served a new piece of content they can download each month and use to participate in competitions			0
the content will include new maps and gameplay modes			0
" the things that we 're charging for are things that we really would n't be able to provide if we did n't , " @entity77 said			0
" it 's not modeled after anything			0
it 's kind of a new entry into the model here			0
" @entity10 has been working on the @entity35 service , which was previously called @entity97 , for two years , @entity77 has said			1
the company formed a division called @entity100 to maintain its development			0
" @entity39 " players were able to beta test elite until mid-october , when @entity10 shut down parts of the service in advance of " @entity15 's " debut			1
subscription gaming has proliferated in a genre called massively multiplayer online role - playing games ( @entity111 , or @entity111 ) , the most prominent being " @entity112			2
" that game happens to be owned by @entity10 's @entity115 arm , allowing the beachhead team to learn from the pros			0
" there are a lot of big brains that we picked down at @entity115 , " @entity77 said			0
" they 've done this kind of relationship with consumers , with gamers , very well , probably better than anybody			0
" @entity49 has tried to marry the first - person shooter genre with vast online worlds in a game called " @entity131			2
" it was n't a hit , but the company announced a sequel this summer			0
@entity10 believes it has found a sweet spot that wo n't muck with the " @entity1 " formula but will still spur gamers to open their wallets			2
" @entity1 : @entity15 " will be available tuesday for pcs and the @entity53 , @entity51 and @entity141 consoles			1
the game retails for $ 60 and is rated @entity143 , meaning it contains content suitable for people ages 17 and older .			0
