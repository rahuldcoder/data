the @entity0 will defend against efforts to remove a giant cross atop a war memorial in @entity4 over claims it violates the constitutional separation of church and state , according to a petition filed this week with the @entity0 @entity9			1
it 's the latest legal salvo in the decades - long battle over the cross on the memorial at @entity14 in @entity15			1
the legal battle has pitted veterans and caretakers of the memorial against the city and those who say it violates the @entity23			2
the court filing by the @entity25 on wednesday comes after the @entity26 petitioned the @entity9 to settle , once and for all , the constitutional question about the cross			0
" ... the @entity0 remains fully committed to preserving the @entity14 cross as an appropriate memorial to our nation 's veterans , " the @entity25 petition said			1
long legal battle the legal wrangling follows a ruling by a @entity0 district judge in december that ordered the cross be taken down from the memorial			1
but the judge stayed his ruling while the case was appealed			0
in the petition filed this week , lawyers for the @entity46 administration warned if the district court reinstated the order that the cross be removed , they would take the issue to the highest court in the nation			1
the cross was erected in 1954 in honor of @entity57 veterans and has been the subject of near constant judicial back - and - forth since 1989 , when two @entity60 veterans filed suit saying it violated the @entity64 's " no preference " clause			1
since that first lawsuit , the city of @entity15 twice tried selling the property beneath the cross to the @entity26 , only to be stopped by the courts			2
in 2004 , the parties involved reached an agreement that would have moved the cross to a nearby church , but two congressmen intervened and inserted a rider into the 2005 omnibus budget bill that designated the property a national veterans ' memorial and authorized the federal government to accept the donation of the property			2
this led to more fights and more court filings			0
@entity86 intervenes the fight became so contentious that @entity86 attempted in 2006 to solve the problem by taking control of the land and designating it a national memorial			0
three congressmen pushed through a bill calling for the government to seize the property by eminent domain -- calling it " a historically significant war memorial			1
" the federal government took possession in august of that year			0
but that was followed by more lawsuits , including one filed by @entity60 veterans @entity104 and now - deceased @entity105 and another filed by the @entity106 on behalf of the @entity107			0
the suits sought to stop the transfer of property to the government , saying the @entity113 cross atop the memorial violated the @entity23 that prohibits the government from taking a position on one religion over another			0
the district court has since consolidated the cases .			0
