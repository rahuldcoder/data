-- after many years of euphoria over @entity2 's rapid growth and the country 's apparently inevitable rise to global economic dominance , the @entity2 story has taken a serious turn for the worse			1
@entity2 , it now seems , is about to collapse , and along the way it may well bring the world economy down with it			1
fortunately , the new story may be as muddled as the old one			0
@entity2 's economic model has relied heavily on investment and debt			1
it should n't be a surprise that after many years of tremendous growth driven at first by badly needed investments , @entity2 spending on infrastructure and manufacturing capacity is slowing down			1
during the same period , debt levels surged as borrowed money poured into more highways , airports , steel mills , shipyards , high - speed railways , and apartment and office buildings than the country could productively use			0
a few economists predicted as far back as 2006 that @entity2 would face a serious debt problem			2
by 2010 , it became obvious even to the most excited of @entity2 bulls that this was indeed happening			2
to protect itself from the risk of a debt crisis , @entity2 must bring spending to a halt			2
@entity44 now wants to rebalance the economy away from its excessive reliance on investment and debt , and to increase the role of consumption as a driver of growth			1
but this can not happen except at lower growth rates			0
so what happens next -- will @entity2 collapse ? probably not			2
a financial collapse is effectively a kind of bank run , and as long as government credibility remains high , banks are guaranteed and capital controls are maintained , it is unlikely that @entity2 will experience anything like a bank run			2
what is far more likely is that in the coming years , @entity2 's gross domestic product growth rate will continue to decline as the country focuses on stimulating consumption			1
growth rates during the administration of president @entity73 are unlikely to exceed 3 % to 4 % on average if the economic rebalancing is managed well			0
will the slower growth rate be a disaster for @entity2 ? certainly , it would be huge departure from the growth rate of roughly 10 % a year for nearly three decades			1
would much lower growth rates create high unemployment and huge dislocations for the economy ? some are worried about such scenarios			0
but the @entity2 economy has so far shown a lot of resilience despite passing storms such as the global financial crisis			1
@entity44 has huge challenges ahead			0
@entity2 's growth has been a boon to large businesses , the state , the powerful and the wealthy elite			1
what the @entity2 government needs to do is recalibrate growth so that average household incomes can rise and consumers have more money to spend			1
this will not be easy to pull off , but there are positive signs			0
@entity73 's government seems determined to make the necessary changes , even at the expense of much slower growth			0
even if gdp growth declines but average @entity2 household income grows at 5 % to 6 % a year , it would put @entity2 in the right direction			2
as for the rest of the world , there 's no reason to panic over @entity2 's economic slowdown			1
contrary to popular beliefs , @entity2 is not the global engine of growth ; it is merely the largest arithmetic component of global growth			2
what drives global growth is demand			0
@entity2 , with a large trade surplus , is not a net provider of demand to the world			0
what matters to the world , in other words , is not how fast @entity2 grows but rather , how its trade with foreign partners evolves			0
if @entity2 rebalances in an orderly way , its imports of manufactured goods and services should rise faster than its exports			0
this will be good for the world			0
what 's more , manufacturing industries around the world that lost out to @entity2 in the export business will benefit			1
when wages rise for @entity2 workers -- so that they have more money to buy goods and services at home -- it means other developing countries will have a chance to compete for exports if they offer lower labor wages			0
there is no doubt that @entity44 has a long road ahead in terms of managing a huge economy , but as of now there should be nothing surprising or unexpected about the slowing growth of @entity2			1
it will probably benefit the @entity2 people and the global economy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			0

@entity174 : some experts think that @entity2 's economy is in big trouble

he says the country needs to shift from investment to consumption model
@entity174 : if @entity2 recalibrates its economy in the right way , everyone will benefit
