@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 gov. @entity3 and former gov. @entity4 face off for the third and final time tuesday night in a debate hosted by @entity2 and @entity0 affiliate @entity7			1
the showdown comes just two weeks before @entity9 and marks a final point in what 's become the most expensive 2014 midterm race in the country , more than any @entity15 or @entity16 campaign			2
@entity3 , an unpopular @entity17 governor , is trying to fend off a challenge from his predecessor , a @entity17 - turned - independent - turned - @entity19 whose likability numbers are also underwater			2
while @entity4 entered the race last november with a sizable polling advantage over @entity3 , the race has tightened up and the two men now find themselves neck - and - neck toward the finish line			1
a @entity2 / @entity28 poll last week indicated the race was tied at 44 %			1
the contest also takes place in the largest presidential swing state , meaning both parties are paying close attention to who will be in the governor 's office come 2016			0
and last week the race became the setting for perhaps the most unusual moment in recent political debate history , when the candidates spent the first seven minutes in a stand - off over @entity4 's use of a personal fan on stage , a blow - up that 's since become known as " fangate			1
" " it 's the perfect storm			0
you ca n't script a better race than this , " said @entity50 , professor of american studies at @entity52 in @entity53			0
the backdrop of the 2016 presidential race — and now fangate			0
" despite the political circus , @entity50 added , the two men have stark differences on policy , and tuesday night gives them a final opportunity to hash out their disagreements			1
here are seven things to watch for in the debate : 1			0
elephant in the room : while @entity4 appeared to break the rules in last week 's debate by having a fan underneath his podium , @entity3 might have fared worse in the optics of the scuffle			1
he maintains he did n't know the debate had started , but by not coming out on stage for seven minutes , @entity77 quickly seized on the episode to paint @entity3 as petty and uninterested in debating the issues			1
fans of @entity4 can now buy their own fan the moment quickly became fodder for late - night tv , and it sparked renewed interest in a race that had extremely low voter turnout in the primaries			1
@entity2 has stated that no fans will be allowed , so it will be interesting to see how @entity4 handles the lack of circulation tuesday night and how @entity3 addresses the mini-drama that put a national spotlight on the race			1
will @entity3 try to add some personality ? @entity1 has a history of popular governors — from @entity100 to @entity101 to @entity102			2
but the back - slapping retail politicking of @entity3 's predecessors has n't come easy for the current governor , a former health care ceo			1
" he comes off as a cold fish ; one that does n't connect well with the average @entity1 , " said @entity108 , political science professor at @entity109 in the @entity111 area			0
" contrast that with a very personable , polished and telegenic @entity4			2
" opinion : when the @entity3 hits the fan experts say @entity3 needs to use the final debate to leave a lasting impression with voters , one that show he has a sense of humor and is capable of exuding warmth			1
one easy way @entity3 could display some humor would be to go after @entity4 over fangate			1
closing debates offer candidates a chance to deliver a line or zinger that can help solidify the storyline for themselves or their opponent in the final stretch of the campaign			2
" it 's their last chance to really make that final impression , both of them would love to come away with a zinger that really resonates , " @entity138 said			2
" i think they 're going to stay pretty close to their talking points , but i think they may want to take a risk at trying to produce a gotcha moment or real memorable moment			0
" college @entity17 : ' @entity153 ' to @entity3 's dress 4			2
expect @entity3 to link @entity4 to @entity155			1
@entity3 's campaign released a new ad monday that features @entity4 praising president @entity155			1
with @entity155 's approval rating at dismal levels — 39 % in @entity1 -- it 's a strategy employed by many @entity17 against their @entity163 opponents this fall			0
unlike a lot of @entity77 , however , @entity4 has n't entirely sought to distance himself from the president , which gives @entity3 more room to sharpen his attack			1
" the drinking game is going to be how many times @entity3 mentions @entity155 , " @entity50 said			2
@entity3 will also attempt to pin @entity4 as untrustworthy because of the former governor 's party switch			1
while @entity4 agrees that same - sex marriage should be legal now , for example , @entity3 argues it 's hard to know how @entity4 truly feels about the issue , given that he opposed it in 2008 when he helped get the state 's same - sex marriage ban on the ballot			1
expect @entity3 to pounce on this flip - flopping angle as much as possible			2
the three numbers you 'll hear ( again and again )			0
the candidates are almost sure to use three numbers over and over again			0
one of @entity3 's most frequent talking points is an attack against @entity4 for overseeing the loss of 832,000 jobs while he was governor from 2007 to 2011			1
meanwhile , @entity3 will be sure to highlight the 640,000 + jobs created under his administration since then			2
by this point , however , @entity4 is well versed in how to respond to @entity3 's attack on the economy			1
" people in @entity1 know i did n't cause the global economic meltdown any more than @entity3 caused the national economic recovery , " he said last week in the debate			1
for his part , @entity4 will focus on the $ 1.3 billion in education cuts during @entity3 's first year as governor			1
while the cuts were caused by the expiration of stimulus funds and while some of them were restored , education is nonetheless a big issue in @entity1 and @entity4 will attempt to hammer home the statistic as much as possible			2
according to @entity2 's poll last week , @entity211 candidate @entity211 pulled a significant share of the vote at 9 % , enough to make a huge difference in a tied race			1
experts say @entity211 could pull votes away from both candidates but perhaps slightly more votes from @entity3 , given his shared views with libertarians on small government , taxes and stand your ground laws			0
and an amendment to legalize medical marijuana is on the ballot this fall , which could boost @entity163 turnout and swing some of the libertarian vote toward @entity4 , who fully endorses the measure			0
@entity3 opposes the initiative , but he has already signed into law a bill that approves certain strains of marijuana for patients with epilepsy , muscle spasms and cancer			0
opinion : the truth about the midterms @entity245 , a public policy professor at @entity246 , said @entity3 could try to attract @entity211 supporters by arguing for less government , but he 'll " have to overcome his association with big business			0
" @entity4 , meanwhile , might find more favor with libertarians on social issues			0
" i will be watching for comments bemoaning big government , big business , and big labor , " said @entity245			0
" but of course this is not an easy sell for either candidate , because @entity3 is supported by big business and @entity4 by big labor			1
@entity265 added that neither candidate has done much to reach out to the rural , white @entity268 voters in the panhandle and central part of the state			2
while most are registered as @entity77 , @entity3 appears to think they will vote @entity17 as they tend to do in statewide races , @entity245 said			0
" but @entity274 might be up for grabs if @entity4 stressed his @entity1 roots			0
he is a native @entity1			0
@entity3 had lived in @entity1 for only four years before running for governor , " he said			0
" without the @entity274 , @entity4 needs a very large turnout to win			0
" surveys say @entity155 and @entity77 hit lowest marks so how would @entity4 try to make such an appeal tuesday night ? @entity265 said to watch for how the @entity19 talks about environmental issues			1
blue dogs live in rural areas and like to fish and hunt , so they want to protect the environment for recreation and sporting purposes			0
" this means they support public lands acquisition , water quality protection , high water levels in fishes and streams , " he said			0
" @entity274 and traditional white @entity268 have been ridiculed for being preoccupied by ' guns , gays , and @entity299 , ' but they are actually more complicated than that			0
they love @entity1 's forests , swamps , rivers , and streams			0

@entity3 and @entity4 take part in a debate tuesday night hosted by @entity2 and @entity7 .
the biggest elephant in the room is @entity4 's use of a fan last week that led to @entity3 *protesting* the debate .
the final debate could come down to whether a candidate makes a zinger that sticks with voters .
