-- for the first time in decades , the hunting of the gray wolf is legal again in the @entity4			2
and that 's a good thing for ranchers like @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , whose sheep are threatened every day by wolves			1
gray wolves were taken off the endangered species list after their population rebounded			1
" we have worked very hard to protect what we have , and it 's not very successful , " she said			0
" it is devastating for us to put all of the money and the time and the genetics and work to produce a great product and then just have it half - eaten and left to die			0
" but wolf hunting is n't popular with everybody			0
it has become a controversy in @entity9 , where the hunt began tuesday , and in @entity29 , where it is scheduled to start september 15			1
environmental and animal rights groups are upset by a federal decision this year to remove gray wolves in the northern @entity34 from the endangered species list , a move that opened the door to permitting the hunts			1
they are seeking an injunction in @entity41 in @entity29 to stop the hunts			1
judge @entity43 is reviewing the case , and it 's unclear when he will rule			1
after their population dwindled in the @entity34 last century , in part because of practices like trapping , gray wolves were put on the endangered species list			1
but the population has rebounded , and the @entity53 delisted the animals and determined that the populations would be healthy enough for hunts to be permitted in @entity9 and @entity29 , which manage the wolf populations			1
there are also gray wolves in @entity59 , but hunts are not permitted there because of the state 's weak wildlife management , the @entity53 said			1
opponents of the hunt say the population is not large and healthy enough to allow hunting			0
@entity66 , a @entity67 spokeswoman , said that the wolf populations " are just on the cusp of recovery and that we are almost there			0
" but she says the hunts represent " a step backward and away from recovery " of the wolf populations			0
@entity77 , one of several groups urging the court to stop the hunt , detailed the ecological role of the wolves on its web site			1
" in what is known as the cascade effect , wolves are exerting influence over a multitude of species within the park 's ecosystem			1
@entity93 , wary of the reintroduced top predator , have altered their grazing behavior			0
" with less grazing pressure from elk , streambed vegetation such as willow and aspen is regenerating after decades of overbrowsing			0
as the trees are restored , they create better habitat for native birds and fish , beaver and other species			0
" @entity7 does n't think the hunt will make much of a difference right now because it is hard to kill the animals			0
but the wolf attacks take their toll			0
for example , the wolves will kill @entity119 guard dogs used to protect the herds			2
when that happens , " then we 're open to prey from bears and everything else , " @entity7 said			0
" we know that it 's a problem , and we want to make sure ranchers can continue on with their livelihood , " @entity66 said			2
" but there has to be some co-existence between wolves and other species			2
" currently , ranchers and farmers can legally shoot a wolf they see attacking their livestock , said @entity136 , wolf recovery coordinator with the @entity53			2
there are also tools used to counter wolf attacks without hunting , he said			0
they include scare tactics , like shooting firecrackers out of a shotgun , or proper fencing			0
" all that stuff works for a little while in some instances for a short period of time and in some situations can be helpful			0
but it is n't the silver bullet for wolf depredation , " he said			0
he said these techniques work " in conjunction with killing wolves			2
" there are state and private programs compensating ranchers who lose livestock because of attacks , but the money represents only part of what the livestock and the time dealing with the problem is worth			2
" the ranchers got the short end of the stick , " @entity136 said			2
officials say that up to 330 wolves in the states of @entity9 and @entity29 may be killed during this public hunt			1
in @entity9 , the limit is 220 wolves , and in @entity29 , it would be 75			1
members of the @entity183 tribe in @entity9 can kill up to 35 wolves			1
@entity185 , spokesman for the @entity186 , said three wolves have been taken in @entity9 since the hunting season began			1
there are more than 1,600 gray wolves in @entity29 , @entity9 and @entity59			1
but @entity7 says " there will never be enough " for environmental groups to agree to the hunts			2
@entity0 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
