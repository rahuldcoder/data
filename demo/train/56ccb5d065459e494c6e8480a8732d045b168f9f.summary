@entity3 every year , @entity2 's @entity1 parade showcases the country 's military might and the diversity of its states			1
this year it went a step further , turning into an occasion that emphasized the warmer relationship between the world 's two biggest democracies , @entity2 and the @entity15			2
@entity15 president @entity16 became the first @entity15 chief guest at the parade			1
not only did he have to endure two hours of a cold @entity3 morning drizzle -- albeit in a glass box -- he also may have noticed how much of @entity2 's military hardware was of @entity22 -- and not @entity15 -- vintage			1
but most @entity2 will focus on the fact that @entity16 is the first sitting @entity15 president to visit @entity2 twice			1
they will remember the many images of @entity16 and prime minister @entity28 shaking hands and exchanging a warm embrace on the airport tarmac and at their first joint press conference in the world 's glare			2
the @entity2 media has dubbed it a " bromance , " evidence of the chemistry that aides on both sides have been at pains to point out for months			0
it seems like an eternity since the former leader of the @entity2 state of @entity46 was persona non grata in the @entity15 and so the biggest takeaway from @entity16 's three days in @entity2 was the symbolism of the leaders of the world 's two biggest democracies cozying up			1
but others would have seen greater geopolitical implications			0
as @entity16 watched the @entity1 parade , @entity56 welcomed @entity59 's army chief @entity58 for talks			2
unlike @entity16 's previous @entity2 visit in 2010 , @entity59 was not a focus -- at least in public statements			1
instead , @entity2 seems to be positioning itself for a more global role , playing a part in issues that go beyond its borders			0
there were some other tangible takeaways from the summit too -- though the exact details were a little fuzzy			0
@entity28 announced progress had been made on negotiations over a civil nuclear deal -- a new 10 - year defense cooperation agreement between the two countries was announced -- which may have far - reaching consequences for both sides on sharing intelligence and military education , and there was much talk about boosting bilateral trade from its current level of around $ 100 billion a year to $ 500 billion by 2025			0
as with most summits between world leaders , what goes on behind the scenes before and after is probably more important -- at least in terms of detail			0
but let 's give symbolism its moment and its due			0
for millions of @entity2 who watched the events of the last three days -- and given the intense media coverage in @entity2 it would have been impossible to miss -- they will now slowly reassess their sense of @entity2 's place in the world			2
as @entity16 departs @entity2 , a push for reform maybe that will help broaden @entity2 's historically insular foreign policy thinking			1
maybe it will make @entity2 a more prominent player in global issues , over time			0
and maybe , just maybe , @entity2 and the @entity15 may move a little closer to forming the " defining partnership " that @entity16 first promised in 2010 .			1

@entity16 's three - day trip showed warm relations between the @entity15 and @entity2
@entity15 president is the first to visit @entity2 twice , a fact likely to be noted by the @entity2 public
could tour help change @entity2 's insular thinking when it comes to foreign policy ?
