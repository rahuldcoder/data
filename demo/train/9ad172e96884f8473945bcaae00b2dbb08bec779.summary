-- endangered cultural sites are the stars of the annual @entity3 -- more commonly known as @entity4 -- on april 18			1
some of these wonders are part of the @entity8 's first annual list of five endangered cultural sites , issued to mark the day and draw attention to the fund 's work			1
the day was first adopted as a concept in 1983 to draw attention to the cultural heritage of communities around the world			0
sites include a natural @entity19 wonderland larger than @entity20 , @entity22 's @entity21 and medieval villages in the @entity24			2
the fund , which works to protect significant and endangered cultural heritage sites in the developing world , named sites they 're working to save from the impact of uncontrolled modern development , tourism and looting			1
" many cultural sites are endangered , especially those in the developing world ( regions where per capita income is less than $ 2 per day ) , and they languish without any international attention , " wrote @entity33 , the fund 's executive director , via e-mail			1
" it 's our hope that @entity4 and our list will inspire community involvement in preserving the legacy of these sites			2
" travelers ' choice : @entity51 's top 25 destinations why focus on these five sites ? some locations were chosen for their historical significance			0
" @entity21 ( in @entity22 ) was once a thriving center of political , social and economic power , and @entity57 ( in @entity58 ) is the oldest man - made place of worship discovered to date			1
as awareness of these two sites has grown , threats such as unregulated tourism and looting could harm the sites , " @entity33 wrote			0
the @entity68 of @entity69 ( in @entity70 ) and the @entity71 ( in @entity72 ) were included because of their important cultural heritage and traditional practices , " which are being eroded by modern development and industrialization , " @entity33 said			0
" finally , we included @entity78 , @entity19 , because it is facing critical environmental threats -- ranching and logging have destroyed 70 percent of its forests in the last decade			0
" do you agree with the fund 's choices ? what would you add ?			0
