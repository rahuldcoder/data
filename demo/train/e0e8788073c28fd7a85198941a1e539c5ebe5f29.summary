@entity0 , @entity1 -- for hundreds of millions of years it has dominated the coastal skyline of southern @entity5 , imposing a dramatic and domineering backdrop to an idyllic location			1
@entity0 , recently voted one of the " @entity9 " by a global audience , now joins the ranks of the @entity13 rainforest of @entity14 and other exotic sites throughout @entity16			1
my task for ' @entity19 ' is to meet the most interesting people living in its shadow , connected to its spirit			2
the first people to live near this majestic mountain were the @entity27 , migrating here some 2,000 years ago			1
as i hike through its rugged terrain near a feature called @entity31 , i approach an unassuming man standing amid the rich biodiversity of flora and fauna			0
his name is @entity37 , a direct descendant of the @entity27 , and he wants to show me a sacred place he visits regularly , but first he hands me something			1
see also : a journey through @entity5 's stunning wine region " this is wild sage , " he tells me as i raise it to my nose , " anytime we journey to the shrine , we bring this to burn			1
it releases all negative energy			0
" i clutch it tightly as we make the 30 - minute trek , off the hiking trail , up the steep terrain walking where few people venture			2
@entity37 stops along the way telling me every plant growing around us was used in some way by his ancestors			0
he snaps in half a stiff aloe vera leaf revealing a green goo and begins to apply it to his hair - i do the same			0
@entity37 says among medicinal uses , aloe keeps hair shiny and wavy			0
when we arrive at the shrine all i see are large rocks grouped together overlooking the coastline and @entity74 - it was simply beautiful			0
in the center just an open space to sit ; no pictures , no idols , no markings whatsoever			0
this is a place to be alone with one 's thoughts			1
as wind whistles through the rock formations @entity37 whispers to me , describing how hard it is to be one of the few remaining @entity27 people here			1
their philosophy was one of use only what you need , and respect all forms of life on the mountain			2
a mantra almost lost with time as the modern world crept in , colonized the area , violently pushing out the @entity27			1
i sit silently allowing him to gather his next thought			0
he says my energy is positive , so we do n't need to burn the sage			0
he sends me off with a heartfelt wish that visitors to @entity1 respect the hallowed ground and remember the first people to call this place home			1
adding that while his " people " may be broken they are not defeated			2
in many ways @entity115 ' request is being carried out by mother of two , @entity118			0
she 's the founder of the " @entity120 " project			2
the @entity27 first called @entity1 " @entity120 " meaning " the place of sweet waters " because of its natural and clean streams stemming from the mountainside			1
the @entity126 colonized it because of the abundant fresh water between the mountain range and the coast			1
but as the city grew , the waterways were gradually closed off ( to limit pollution ) and now all of it gets dumped into the @entity74			0
blog : discovering the real @entity136 i meet @entity118 at the foot of @entity0 with her 10 - year - old son			1
with a master 's degree in @entity142 and @entity143 , @entity118 explains her research requires she map each and every stream , step by step , turn by turn			2
her son likes to join the adventure			0
we pull back branches , jump over puddles and discover pristine waterways rushing down the porous sandstone of the mountain and over the solid granite of the ground			2
later , @entity118 unlocks an old fence , walking me to a mysterious underground housing			0
behind the four - foot - high @entity126 style door is a pitch - black room			0
inside , crystal clear water on its way to the ocean			2
her calculations tell her there is enough fresh water in this system for all residents living in the immediate surroundings			2
@entity118 explains that efforts to lobby officials to reopen these water sources are falling on deaf ears - but still she charges on			0
beyond the challenges of local bureaucracy she feels a deep - rooted commitment to the project and her @entity1 neighbors			1
of course , the views atop @entity0 are breathtaking , watching from 1,000 meters in the sky as white clouds roll over the cliff 's edge , explaining why locals call this the " tablecloth			1
" this is also one of the most photographed places in the world , but i wonder how many people truly see the beauty			0
i purposely did n't want to write about the sights , the awe inspiring views this week because of that			0
instead i want people going to @entity1 to remember @entity37 and @entity118 ; look closer , dig deeper and reflect on what the people of @entity0 represent			1
my journey of discovery ' @entity19 ' has taken me through @entity207 in @entity136 and all around @entity1 , @entity5 and now i 'm setting my compass to @entity209 and the sights of @entity211 ... stay tuned .			1

@entity2 's @entity213 visited the @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity5
a descendant of @entity27 , the first people to live near the mountain showed @entity213 a sacred place
@entity213 also met an *environmentalist* to learn about water *protection* in the region
the journey ended with a breathtaking view as @entity213 reached the top of the mountain
