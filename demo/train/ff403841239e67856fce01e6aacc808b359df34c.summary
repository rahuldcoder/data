@entity0 -- the white house counsel refused friday to comply with a subpoena as issued by a @entity5 panel regarding the failed solar energy company @entity7 , saying that the initiative " was driven more by partisan politics than a legitimate effort to conduct a responsible investigation			1
" @entity12 expressed her views in a letter to @entity15			0
@entity16 and @entity17 , members of the @entity19			0
a day earlier , one of its subcommittees requested internal documents regarding the government 's decision to issue more than half a billion dollars in federal loan guarantees in 2010 to @entity7 , which later filed for bankruptcy			0
the @entity5 counsel on friday did not rule out disclosing additional information related to @entity7 , saying that " we remain willing to work with the committee to accommodate its legitimate oversight interests in a balanced manner			1
" at the same time , @entity12 said unequivocally that the subpoena , as written , was unacceptable			1
" the committee 's extremely broad request for documents -- now a subpoena -- is a significant intrusion on executive branch interests , " @entity12 wrote			2
@entity16 , the @entity42 @entity41 who heads the broader @entity36 , issued a statement friday saying that the " @entity5 could have avoided the need for subpoena authorizations if they had simply chosen to cooperate			1
" " we have been reasonable every step of the way in this investigation , and it is a shame that the @entity53 administration and @entity5 @entity54 continue to put up partisan roadblocks to hide the truth from taxpayers , " @entity16 said after @entity12 's announcement			1
" @entity7 was a jobs program gone bad , and we must learn the lessons of @entity7 as we work to turn our economy around and put folks back to work			0
... what is the @entity64 trying to hide ? we owe it to @entity67 taxpayers to find out			0
" a government official said the @entity5 favors a narrower request			2
a letter from a group of @entity54 , sent to the committee before it issued the subpoena , said the @entity5 would be willing to share documents related to campaign contributors ' influence on the decision to grant or restructure the @entity7 loan guarantee , plus the @entity5 's involvement in deciding whether to make such a conditional commitment or close the loan guarantee			1
@entity83 and @entity84 wrote then that issuing the subpoena -- as it was written -- was unnecessary , given what they called " substantial progress " in recent talks between committee members and the @entity5 about disclosing more information on @entity7			1
the oversight and investigations subcommittee , part of the larger @entity19 , voted 14 - 9 along party lines in favor of issuing the subpoena			1
that followed a contentious debate among its members , with republicans accusing the @entity53 administration of stonewalling and some democrats calling the subpoena resolution politically motivated			1
" we need to learn the circumstances of the original deal as the restructuring			0
we need all the facts , all the witnesses , all the documents , " @entity84 , a @entity113 @entity112 , said at this week 's hearing , describing the subpoena as " an act of irresponsible partisanship			2
" " sadly , after seeing ( @entity41 ' ) conduct of this investigation , i do not believe they share this goal			2
" in her letter friday , @entity12 called the subpoena " unprecedented and unnecessary			0
" she said that the @entity5 had made a " good - faith offer , " which the subcommittee rejected " without explaining how it fell short of your legitimate oversight purposes			1
" among other issues , @entity12 said that the panel 's request for producing copies of all communications related to @entity7 -- including , she claimed , " thousands of pages of news clips " -- within days was unrealistic and would require substantial resources			0
defending the @entity53 administration , the counsel said , " none of the more than 85,000 pages of documents produced to date evidence any favoritism to political supporters or wrongdoing by the @entity5			1
" @entity17 , the subcommittee 's chairman , earlier said the @entity154 " repeatedly failed to cooperate with our investigation , and we agreed to put off a vote on that subpoena " in hopes that engaging the @entity5 could avoid the need for subpoenas			1
" only after repeated failed attempts to engage the @entity5 did the committee notify the @entity5 " that it intended to discuss possible subpoenas , the @entity155 @entity41 said			1
" this finally got the attention of the @entity5 counsel , " who then met with lawmakers wednesday , he said			1
" unfortunately , the @entity5 was unable or unwilling to answer even the most basic questions			2
" @entity54 slammed the subcommittee 's move , though some acknowledged that the @entity5 could be more forthcoming with information in the case			1
veteran rep. @entity171 , @entity172 , said after the vote , " i 've never seen a procedure quite like this			0
" we are protesting here a sweeping subpoena , " he said			0
since @entity41 have " been able to find nothing " wrong in what they 've looked at , they have " increased the size of the net and reduced the size of the holes in the net as they go about this fishing expedition			2
" federal analysts looking at the proposed @entity7 loan in 2009 warned then of possible problems , as well as pressure from the @entity5 to speed up a decision , according to a memorandum released last month by congressional investigators			2
approved in may 2010 , the @entity196 's loan allowed @entity7 to build a factory in @entity198 , @entity199 , to produce state - of - the - art solar panels			2
@entity7 filed for bankruptcy in late august and closed its doors , putting more than 1,000 people out of work after it had received $ 535 million in loan guarantees			0
the bankruptcy leaves the federal government unlikely to get the loan money back			0
president @entity53 had touted the company in a widely publicized visit last year			0
@entity5 chief of staff @entity212 announced last week that he is ordering a 60 - day independent review of the state of the @entity196 's loan portfolio			1
the review will include recommendations about how to improve the loan monitoring process			0
the review will be headed by @entity220 , a veteran of both the @entity53 and last @entity222 administrations who oversaw the @entity224 , among other efforts			0
@entity1 's @entity226 contributed to this report .			0
