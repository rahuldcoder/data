-- when researchers present what the media perceive as " big " findings -- as my colleagues and i did last week in reporting a plume of oil from the @entity11 oil well in the @entity12 -- it is incumbent on scientists and journalists to keep the results in perspective and refrain from veering into misleading waters			1
unfortunately , in this case , both parties failed			0
reporters and editors , in their quest for the biggest story possible , injected their reports with implications unintended by scientists			0
for their part , scientists from various corners of government and academia -- including our group at the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) -- let it happen			0
in some cases , they may have even encouraged it			0
instead of being able to consider our results on the basis of the information alone ( '' just the facts , ma'am '' ) , readers , viewers and listeners around the world were exposed to newspaper , tv and radio reports clouded with politically charged agendas that were premature at the least and outright wrong at the most			1
i must have spoken with at least 25 journalists last week , and despite my every effort to explain our findings , the media were more interested in using the new information to portray a duel between competing scientists			1
the story turned into an us - versus - them scenario in which some scientists are right and others are wrong			1
seeking to elucidate , i felt caught in a crossfire			0
on august 4 , the @entity66 released a report giving its best initial estimates accounting for where the oil spilled in the @entity12 went			1
two weeks later , scientists at the @entity72 and the @entity73 countered with their own inventory , arguing @entity66 underestimated the amount of oil remaining in the ocean			1
our research confirmed the existence of a subsurface oil plume in june that did not come from a natural sea floor oil seep and that was not substantially degraded by deep - sea microbes			1
the research added new information to an unfolding investigation , but the media seemed more interested in whether our work decided whether @entity66 or the @entity91 group was right			0
even though my colleagues and i repeatedly avoided contrasting our results with previous @entity66 estimates that some 75 percent of the spilled oil was already gone from the @entity12 , much of last week 's coverage of our work made that a prominent part of the story			1
for example , the @entity98 reported , " academic scientists are challenging the @entity103 administration 's assertion that most of @entity105 's oil in the @entity12 is either gone or rapidly disappearing -- with one group thursday announcing the discovery of a 22 - mile ' plume ' of oil that shows little sign of vanishing			1
" in doing so , it cast our results as evidence of sorts that the @entity66 estimates were wrong , and at the same time had the effect of giving the @entity91 work our imprimatur			1
neither of these conclusions was ever meant to be drawn from our research on the oil plume			1
this reasoning implicit in the media coverage was not only premature , but it might turn out to be wrong			1
science does not work that way			1
it is not a house of cards where one dissenting view leads to a complete collapse			0
rather , science is more like a jigsaw puzzle			1
occasionally a wrong piece may be placed , but eventually science will correct it			1
both the corrections and the completion of any scientific puzzle take time			2
scientific peers regulate the process of presenting hypotheses , acquiring data and assessing them			0
in this process , questions are asked , gaps get filled , inconsistencies are hammered out , discoveries are made , problems get solved and knowledge is obtained			2
@entity124 's regulatory systems have a very solid record of accomplishment			2
unfortunately , the process takes months or years , but in this case , it has been compressed into days with dueling reports and news conferences on the fantails of boats			2
news organizations have n't the luxury of time to distill scientific findings and put them into context , which increases the risk of oversimplifying scientific findings			1
some of these problems are scientists ' fault			0
in our world in the peer - review process , we liberally , passionately , sometimes harshly interrogate each other , where we argue over details and interpretations of research results to ensure that they are bulletproof			2
out of the academic world , reporters can magnify negative comments by scientists about research results			2
as the number of science journalists gets smaller , this problem will grow			2
one solution is for scientists to gain skills needed to bridge the communication gaps between the academic world and the lay public , media and policymakers			0
in addition , scientists need to learn how to say " no " to reporters			0
for many of us , we desperately want to please a reporter , who for the first time cares about what you do			2
and scientists , including me , have egos , so we want our thoughts and work recognized			0
but scientists have a better chance of getting the story straight if they listen carefully to the questions asked by reporters and understand the reporters ' goals			0
in 1994 , 11 scientists published a study , " the fate of the oil spilled from the @entity218 : the mass balance is the most complete and accurate of any major oil spill			1
" of these 11 authors , six were @entity66 scientists , one was from academia and four from four different consulting firms			0
the @entity225 happened in 1989			0
if it took five years to " balance the books " on how much oil was spilled and where it went for the @entity218 spill , how are we getting estimates of the @entity11 spill only weeks afterward ? it 's not trivial to decipher something as vast , fluid , complex and inaccessible as the ocean			1
so given that it is so early in this investigation of the @entity234 , i would consider both the @entity66 and @entity91 studies as first passes			0
neither is absolutely right or wrong			2
they are certainly not the definitive findings , but should be thought of as a foundation from which to work , road maps to use in assigning future research assets in examining the transport and fate of oil in the @entity12			1
those road maps will be refined into robust values as more information becomes available			0
eventually , teams of scientists will be able to " balance the books " for the @entity11 spill , too			0
over the next few months , many scientific studies on the spill will be published and reported on			0
@entity262 , the first draft of history , is incremental , too			2
consider each scientific report like a chapter in an epic novel , and not necessarily in order			0
let the dust settle and read the book in a few years			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity273 .			1

@entity273 's team confirmed subsurface oil plume in @entity12 in june
he says results were wrongly portrayed as a challenge to @entity103 administration findings
@entity273 says his study adds to body of knowledge but does n't prove other findings wrong
science is incremental , takes a long time to reach definitive conclusions , he says
