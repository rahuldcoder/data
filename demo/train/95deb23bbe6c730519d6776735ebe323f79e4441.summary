@entity0 , @entity1 -- for three days , they had been waiting , waiting , waiting			1
they were high , dry and alive , but their patience , energy and water supplies were running low			0
up to 200 people knew they could n't venture out on their own , marooned in the @entity0 office building after the remnants of a massive tsunami swamped the town , as it did many others in northeast @entity1			1
when @entity1 military personnel arrived , to whisk them away in boat after boat after boat -- over scores of trips , two to six people at a time -- they finally knew that survival was at hand			1
still , many of their hopes and prayers remained unanswered			0
" i have no words " to describe how difficult it has been since last friday 's 9.0 - magnitude earthquake , @entity30 said			2
" i 'm so scared			1
" prime minister @entity34 said monday about 15,000 people have been rescued , according to @entity1 's @entity36			1
yet such success stories -- like what happened monday in @entity0 , a city of about 160,000 northeast of the hard - hit city of @entity41 -- are becoming increasingly rare , as time , food and water runs out for those stuck in buildings , covered in rubble or otherwise clinging for life			1
@entity1 tv network @entity48 showed video of one man canvassing the streets on his bicycle , attached to which he 'd written a sign with his wife 's name			1
he carried photos of her , showing them to everyone he met in a desperate attempt to find her			0
a business owner in @entity63 choked back tears monday , as he came upon a worker who had survived the tsunami that had consumed his town			2
he told @entity48 that he 'd located half of his 25 employees by monday , but could n't account for the rest			0
@entity30 , the woman in @entity0 , knew that most of her co-workers were safe			1
she had been working alongside them , inside of the office building , when the quake struck friday afternoon			2
but having no cell phone service or other means of communication , she did not know what had happened to her parents			0
in addition to those working inside , more people had trudged through floodwaters or otherwise sought refuge in @entity86 's building -- one of the highest in the northeast @entity1 town though , despite its locations several miles from the shoreline , still within the tsunami 's reach			1
@entity1 authorities knew for some time that people were trapped inside , but could not dispatch rescue crews there due to difficulty in reaching the disaster - ravaged area and the scores of other crises competing for help			1
by monday , the military began criss - crossing @entity0 's streets in dozens of small rowboats and inflatable rafts , the only way to get around given the omnipresent water			1
one soldier told @entity2 that the mission of searching for signs of life in his homeland was emotionally challenging , if undoubtedly important			0
en route , the troops spotted one woman waving a white towel from a second - floor window			2
she told them she needed water , but did n't want to leave her home			0
the soldiers yelled to her , " we 'll come and get you later on			0
" some evacuated from the office building , like @entity86 , ended up going to hospitals to check their health after three days of subsisting on dwindling amounts of food and water			2
others said they had no desire to go home , right away -- with one man telling @entity2 he just wanted to go to a " safe place			2
" many survivors in @entity0 and other quake - and tsunami - ravaged communities like it around @entity1 did n't have a choice to go home : more than 450,000 people whose homes were lost or are inaccessible are now in shelters , according to @entity48			1
still , heading home was a problem for tomorrow			0
for now , the challenge of making sense of the tragedy and coming to grips with their grief was more than daunting enough			0
after arriving at a @entity150 shelter , weakened survivors rescued from @entity0 were gently placed on stretchers and carried away			1
@entity48 showed a civil defense soldier carrying a woman into a room at the shelter			2
after he gingerly set her down , the woman rose to her feet with some difficulty and bowed to the soldier , telling him that she was all right			2
she bowed again and then collected herself to briefly tell her story , paraphrased by an @entity48 interpreter : " she had been waiting for help all night , outside			0
she had been washed away by the wave			0
... the moment she opened the door of the house , the water flooded in			0
... she grabbed hold of a tree and hung on , hung on for dear life with the water all around her			0
a ... floor mat floated by , and she grabbed it and held on to that			0
" as the woman spoke in @entity1 , the interpreter 's voice trembled in @entity180 : " her daughter was washed away			1
she was washed away , and she has not found her			0
" @entity2 's @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			1

a woman rescued from a @entity0 building says , " i 'm so scared -- i am panicked "
she , like many others , have not been able to locate loved ones after the tsunami
rescue teams in rowboats have brought in *hundreds* of survivors in that city alone
@entity1 's prime minister has said at least 15,000 have been rescued , a report says
