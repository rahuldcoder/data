to paraphrase " @entity1 , " if @entity2 had invented @entity3 , he would have invented @entity3			1
but in a tall tale that would have made the @entity2 proud , a blog post saying that he did just that was making the rounds wednesday			1
and some online media outlets were quick to take the bait			2
blogger @entity11 , a consultant who works with blogs and other web businesses to help grow their sites , posted a fantastic yarn tuesday about stumbling upon a tombstone in @entity19 that ultimately led him to the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
there , he discovered an 1845 patent filed by @entity2 for a sort of personalized newspaper in which " every man may have his own page , where he might discuss his family , his work , and his @entity31			1
" each page would feature a profile picture at the top left			2
the user 's name , address and profession would appear at the top			2
on a sample page , @entity2 shared two poems he " liked , " a short story about the @entity43 and details about what he did that day ( went to the circus )			1
" put all that together on one page and tell me what it looks like to you , " @entity48 wrote			2
looks like something we see every day , does n't it ? " in short : @entity2 envisioned a paper version of @entity3 , 160 years before @entity64			1
except for the fact that none of it is true			2
" i just wanted to have fun with it , " @entity48 said wednesday			0
" i 've done this before			0
every couple of years , i do a hoax			0
i knew this would go big but did n't expect those dozens of outlets to just run with it without 30 seconds of fact - checking			2
" for careful readers , @entity48 's post is sprinkled with what should have been plenty of red flags			2
for one , he writes that his search began after he discovered an apparent friendship between @entity87 and legendary huckster @entity88			0
you know , the guy widely believed to have said , " there 's a sucker born every minute " and " you can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time			0
" ( both of those quotes , by the way , may not have actually been said by @entity88			0
) he even quotes @entity102 's entry calling @entity88 " an @entity104 showman , businessman , scam artist and entertainer , remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes			0
" the tombstone in question supposedly belonged to a carny who brags on it about how he " bluffed " @entity2 and @entity88 in a poker game			1
and photos like the one shown on the page @entity2 supposedly created would n't appear in newspapers for several more decades			1
" i just did it for fun : an homage to @entity88 and his hoaxes ... and @entity2 's tall tales , " @entity48 said			1
" just something fun like that for the modern day			0
" but he also wanted to make a bigger point : " that the @entity127 would fall over itself to be first and share without checking			0
" in the first 24 hours after he posted , the article was shared on @entity3 more than 10,000 times , @entity48 said , adding that his personal blog got more than 50,000 visitors			1
@entity134 posted a story under the headline " @entity2 filed a @entity137 for a @entity138 in 1845			1
" by wednesday morning , that story had been pulled			0
" a @entity134 contributor took @entity11 's story at face value , " a spokeswoman said in an e-mail			1
" once @entity134 realized it was a prank , the article was pulled from the site			0
" @entity149 blog @entity148 did the same			2
as of wednesday afternoon , the story was still online , with a note saying that it 's a hoax and with some , but not all , of the fake information crossed out			1
( hey , a page view is a page view , right ? ) at tech blog @entity155 , a story was followed by another pointing out that the too - good - to - be - true story was , in fact , too good to be true			1
the first line of the original story ? " you ca n't make this stuff up , folks			0
" next web writer @entity165 said the story was popping up elsewhere online when he posted it under the site 's " @entity168 , " section , which features mostly fun , light - hearted stories			2
" while it probably should have been marked as fiction by the author , who is obviously extremely imaginative , these things do happen , " he said in an e-mail			0
" i 'm sure it got him the attention he was seeking			0
" for his part , @entity48 said , he enjoyed watching tech bloggers on @entity182 first share the story but then argue amongst themselves about who got fooled first			0
" @entity187 , you both got punked , " he said with a laugh			0
and while @entity48 's story was made up , he may have gotten a little closer to the 16th president 's true nature than he realized			0
@entity2 never envisioned creating a way for his contemporaries to share cute pictures of their cats , much less play @entity196 ( which no doubt would have seemed less exotic in rural 19th - century @entity104 )			1
but he did become the only @entity104 president in history to hold a patent for an invention			0
according to the @entity202 , @entity2 filed in 1849 for a patent on a tool designed to lift ships off of sandbars			1
that tool , much like @entity2 's proto - web startup , never became a reality .			1

blog post about @entity2 and @entity3 fools the web
blogger @entity11 wrote that @entity2 patented a personal newspaper
the fake paper would feature personal information and " status updates "
he meant it to be a joke , but several news sites reported it as fact
