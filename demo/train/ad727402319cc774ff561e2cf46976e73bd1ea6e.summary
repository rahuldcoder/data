it is like many of the images of aftermath in @entity5 's chaotic war -- a man being pulled from the rubble of the building			1
but this one is different			0
the panic is muted , the men dig not slowly , but leisurely			0
this is because they know he is a regime fighter			1
" where are your friends ? " they ask , perhaps taunting him			0
" are you from @entity20 ? " but no , this is something different			0
as they pull his terrified , tired frame from the dust , the blood seeping from a head wound and pitted against the white coat of silt from the rubble , it becomes clear this regime fighter is @entity33			1
video obtained by @entity35 from @entity5 rebels , which we can not verify , shows this scene and the attempts by the rebels , who are engaged in a pitched battle to prevent the regime encircling the main @entity5 city of @entity45 , to interrogate their new prisoner			1
that 's the first indication there 's something new here : he does n't speak @entity52 , but mutters in @entity53			1
facially , he appears @entity54 or @entity55 , and is terrified			2
their video shows him bandaged up , and on an iv drip			2
he is locked in a basement and fed , then questioned further			0
a comparatively generous fate for a regime prisoner in this savage war			0
it is unclear what happened to him , but he told his interrogators : " my name is @entity68			0
the @entity69 pay people like me to come here and fight			2
i am from @entity33 and i am an immigrant in @entity69			1
the @entity69 brought us to @entity5 to fight to defend the @entity74 shrine			1
i do n't want to fight anymore			0
" he says he wants to go home , and that he was paid about $ 500 a month to fight			2
there are many @entity33 immigrants in @entity69 , trying to find some shelter from the decades of war that have torn apart their land			1
he says he was trained and then sent to assist the regime			0
it is potentially a serious development in the @entity5 war , and explains in some ways how the @entity5 regime has gained ground in some areas after months of appearing exhausted			2
in the fight for @entity45 , they are fiercely contesting a hill settlement called @entity93 , which is itself tiny , but vitally overlooks the main supply road into rebel held areas of @entity45			0
if the regime hold @entity99 , they can cut off rebel @entity45 from resupply , effectively besieging it			0
seasoned @entity33 fighters could assist the regime - so far letting the @entity104 and moderate @entity5 rebels take on @entity106 -- in other battles too			1
@entity35 sent a photojournalist to eastern @entity33 to follow up reports of recruitment by @entity69 agents of mercenaries to fight for the regime			1
inside @entity33 in one village , four men who did not want their identity or location revealed , said they had just returned from training in @entity69			1
there , they were taken to a police station , blindfolded , and taken to a training camp where they were shown tactics and light to medium weapons			0
the men spoke in great detail about their experiences and were able to show the @entity69 bank cards through which they will be paid their $ 500 to $ 1000 salaries a month			1
other villagers ratified their stories			0
most said they sought money - a likely motivation as the @entity138 drawdown in @entity33 is changing the @entity140 's dynamics and reducing the amount of money sloshing around in the country			2
they also wanted to fight @entity145 -- saying that fighting the moderate @entity5 rebels the regime is targeting most heavily and who receive @entity145 assistance - was one way of continuing this fight from @entity33			1
" we want to go there for two reasons one is to fight against those who are being assisted by @entity145 in @entity5 and secondly @entity69 pays us to fight in @entity5 , " said one man			1
" those who fight against @entity160 regime are @entity145 's slaves			1
that is why we want to fight them and kill them			0
" they said they were former @entity140 who had left for @entity69 after disagreements in the militant group , known for its fractious and sprawling membership			0
" before this we used to be part of the @entity140 in @entity33 , but after our disagreements caused tensions among us , we left the @entity140 and went to @entity69			1
we are going there to fight			0
either we will be killed or will be back with the monthly salary that the @entity69 have promised to give us			0
" @entity106 yet their limited knowledge of the @entity5 conflict exposed a complex issue over which their loyalties to their paymasters , @entity69 , may be tested			1
asked about @entity106 , a predominantly @entity184 group like the @entity140 , the men said they knew little about them , but " if we see them in @entity5 , we will definitely sit with them , talk to them and if our thoughts were similar , we would become friends with them			2
" that would be one unexpected outcome for the @entity69 agents accused of assisting these men			2
@entity5 's war has local regime militia , joined by @entity197 from @entity198 , @entity200 militia , on one side			2
@entity106 and its array of global radicals on another			0
and @entity5 rebels , spanning the width of @entity206 , to moderates with foreign backing			1
@entity5 's chaotic , intractable , and hopelessly unnegotiable war , just got another complex and battle - hardened actor .			0

*unverified* video from @entity5 rebels shows them pulling an @entity160 regime fighter from rubble
the man appears terrified and is unable to speak @entity52 , it becomes clear that he is @entity33
the man tells interrogators that he is an immigrant to @entity69 , which has paid him to fight in @entity5
@entity35 went to @entity33 and met other men recruited by @entity69 who had returned from @entity5
