-- a @entity2 court hearing concluded friday with the family of @entity4 -- a 13 - year - old girl on a ventilator who has been declared dead by doctors -- and a hospital agreeing on a protocol for the release of the girl to another facility			1
the specifics of any such release -- how she 'd be transferred , by and to whom , and at what time -- continue to be discussed			0
so while friday 's @entity19 hearing did signal apparent progress in the hot - button case , it does not represent a final agreement			2
earlier in this hearing , the judge asked attorneys for the @entity4 family and @entity27 to confer to attempt to settle the issue of what will happen with @entity4			1
after this hearing broke , representatives for both the family and hospital headed to federal court			2
there , a magistrate will oversee mandatory talks between representatives of the hospital and the family , @entity0 affiliate @entity34 reported			0
both hearings occurred on the same day that the coroner for @entity41 issued a death certificate for @entity4			1
this action is not directly connected to friday 's pair of legal proceedings			0
the coroner 's office said that the death certificate -- which still needs to be accepted by the health department to become official -- has a date of death of december 12 , 2013			1
twenty - six days from that day could be another milestone in this ordeal : a judge has ruled that @entity4 can be removed from a ventilator at 5 p.m. tuesday			1
bleeding profusely last month , @entity4 had surgery to remove her tonsils , adenoids and extra sinus tissue			2
doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea , a condition that made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems			0
before the surgery , @entity4 was worried that she would never wake up , according to her uncle			2
she seemed fine after the surgery and asked for a popsicle because her throat hurt			0
opinion : let the parents decide it was n't long before something went terribly wrong			0
in the intensive care unit , the girl began bleeding profusely -- an image that her mother said would be forever seared in her mind			0
according to family members , @entity4 went into cardiac arrest			1
days later , she was declared brain dead			2
hospital officials have said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case			0
more support the family of @entity89 has joined the battle recently			0
" together with our team of experts , @entity93 believes @entity4 's case is representative of a very deep problem within the @entity100 healthcare system -- particularly those issues surrounding the deaths of patients within the confines of hospital corporations , which have a vested financial interest in discontinuing life , " the @entity91 said in a statement			1
@entity89 was a brain - damaged woman who died in 2005 after living on a feeding tube for more than a decade			0
she was the subject of a lengthy legal battle between her parents and her husband , @entity89 , who maintained that she would n't have wanted to live in a " persistent vegetative state			0
" the organization said it has been overseeing the efforts of several groups to help get @entity4 transferred out of @entity27 and brought " to a safe place			1
" @entity4 's family said tuesday that it had found a facility in @entity121 willing to take her			1
the @entity126 hospital " refused to agree to allow us to proceed in that matter , " @entity4 's uncle @entity122 said			1
the hospital denied the accusation			0
" we have done everything to assist the family of @entity4 in their quest to take the deceased body of their daughter to another medical facility , " hospital spokesman @entity128 said			1
" to date , they have been unwilling or unable to provide a physician to perform the procedures necessary , transportation , or a facility that would accept a dead person on a ventilator			1
our hearts and thoughts go out to them in this tragic situation , but the statements being made by their attorney and some family members are misleading and untrue			0
" family attorney @entity152 had accused the hospital of being " hell - bent " on ending @entity4 's life			1
in addition to the coroner , a judge has declared @entity4 brain dead as well			1
doctors say there 's no chance she will come back to life			2
@entity122 said wednesday that the family still hopes to move her to another facility			2
he accused the hospital of starving his niece by not using a feeding tube to provide her with nutrients			0
@entity128 said a judge had dismissed the family 's request for additional medical procedures tuesday , including a feeding tube			2
@entity0 's @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			0
