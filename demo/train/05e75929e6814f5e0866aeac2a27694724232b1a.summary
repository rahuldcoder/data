-- after president @entity1 made his tepid endorsement of same - sex marriage last week , the pundits , from @entity5 all the way to the @entity7 , quickly pivoted from asking why to whether it will hurt him politically			2
but there is a more interesting question : how , in less than a decade , did @entity11 go from being a country in which some states punished gay sex with criminal penalties to one in which the highest elected official in the land now champions the right of same - sex couples to marry ? the answer can be found in the interaction between supporters of marriage equality and the @entity27 conservative movement over the past few decades			1
as late as the 1980s , same - sex marriage was on virtually no one 's radar screen			2
in 1972 , the @entity11 @entity31 found the idea of a legal right of same - sex couples to marry so outlandish that it dismissed a @entity37 case presenting the issue without bothering to write an opinion			0
at the time , the gay rights movement was understandably focused on combating private violence and public discrimination			2
no single factor explains the movement 's shift to the goal of marriage equality , but much of the credit must go to the very religious conservatives who assiduously campaigned against same - sex marriage , thus forcing the issue onto the front burner of @entity11 politics			1
it happened like this : in 1993 , in the case of @entity58 , the @entity56 decided that the state 's prohibition on same - sex marriage was discriminatory			0
in 1998 , @entity62 's voters passed a referendum giving the legislature the right to declare same - sex marriage illegal , but in the meantime , social conservatives had taken the issue to the national stage , where it promised to pay handsome dividends			1
same - sex marriage was still so unpopular that in 1996 , tremulous @entity72 joined @entity73 in overwhelmingly passing the @entity74 , or @entity74 , signed by president @entity75			0
that act defined marriage at the federal level to mean only heterosexual marriage and authorized states to deny recognition to same - sex marriages performed in other states -- even though , at the time , no state had authorized the practice			0
@entity74 was thus a preemptive strike by the opponents of marriage equality			1
but the act helped to call into being the very marriage equality movement it aimed to combat			1
encouraged by their surprising , if temporary , success in @entity62 , and outraged by the blatantly homophobic arguments that had been made in favor of @entity74 , the lesbian / gay / bisexual / transgender movement reluctantly began to turn its energy and resources toward the goal of marriage equality			1
this was a fundamental shift , not made without controversy within the movement , where many worried that calling for marriage equality would unleash the fury of the @entity105			1
whereas many activists had given higher priority to such issues as employment discrimination , hiv / aids education and protection against hate crimes , the denial of marriage equality now came to be seen as a broad symbol of second - class citizenship for @entity116			1
@entity1 's declaration of his support for marriage equality the day after @entity120 residents banned both same - sex marriage and civil unions in a referendum is only the latest encapsulation of the dialectical interaction of movement and countermovement : each effort to limit marriage equality has led to a countereffort on behalf of equal rights			1
as the first @entity132 - @entity11 president , @entity1 could not be seen to stand on the wrong side of the most prominent civil rights struggle of our time			0
@entity116 increasingly see laws that deny a person the right to marry someone of the same sex as reminiscent of the ugly laws that once forbade interracial marriage			0
the rest is , if not yet history , at least a well - known story			0
although same - sex marriage remains illegal in most of the @entity11 , and the issue may yet play to @entity151 's advantage in november , time is on the side of equality			2
those of us who favor same - sex marriage are rightly grateful to @entity1 for having come off the fence			0
but we should also thank religious conservatives for having put the president on the fence in the first place			0
were it not for their opposition to same - sex marriage , it might have taken much longer for @entity116 to take up the cause			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 and @entity168 .			0

@entity170 and @entity168 : how did gay marriage issue move to *forefront* so quickly ?
they say @entity176 *people* had been quiet on it ; issue came up when @entity62 court ruled for it
they say conservatives pushed back hard , and the marriage equality movement started
writers : if right had *n't* brought national opposition , issue would have remained under the radar
