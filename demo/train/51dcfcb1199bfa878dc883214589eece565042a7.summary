-- the @entity1 has been rudely reminded that @entity2 is a major power with different values , ambitions and goals than @entity1 's			1
@entity8 's brazen move to assert @entity2 interests , in @entity10 in particular and @entity11 in general , seems to have come as a shock to many leaders in the @entity15 administration and to most of the @entity1 news media			1
president @entity15 had after all ridiculed sen. @entity17 in 2008 and gov. @entity18 in 2012 for suggesting that @entity2 policy could become a major problem			2
then secretary of state @entity21 dramatically pushed a reset button to demonstrate the @entity15 team 's commitment to working with @entity2			2
president @entity15 , not realizing he was on an open microphone , promised then - @entity2 president @entity27 that once he was past the election he could be more flexible in accommodating @entity2 concerns			2
all this naive fantasy of a " good @entity2 " has been shattered in the last week			2
the earlier overly positive statements have been replaced with a tendency to demonize president @entity8			2
for example , @entity33 has moved from her reset button to comparing @entity8 to @entity37 ( a comparison she ca n't possibly have meant but which is a perfect case study in the hysteria to which symbolic liberalism is prone )			2
strong words mask a position of weakness			0
as former secretary of state @entity46 has observed , calling @entity8 names is not a substitute for a strategy			2
the @entity1 has virtually no tactical cards it can play in the @entity10			1
we are not going to confront the @entity2 militarily			2
the local population of @entity10 is at least 60 % @entity2 - speakers			1
association with @entity2 might win a popular referendum ( thus putting the democracies in a real dilemma )			2
on the other hand , @entity8 may reconsider the idea of independence for @entity10 because the @entity62 voters are needed to win in @entity11 overall			1
if the heavily pro-russian @entity10 were no longer in @entity11 , the pro-western forces would be substantially stronger in @entity64			0
whatever happens in the next few weeks in @entity10 , the @entity1 has a very limited tactical ability to affect it			1
the @entity1 and our allies can do a fair amount to help the rest of @entity11 stay independent and we should commit to that project			0
however , in the long run there is a much greater threat that the @entity1 has to confront			0
the very principles that led @entity8 to use force in @entity10 could be applied to the @entity76 of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
there are a lot of ethnic @entity2 in all three countries ( and especially in @entity79 )			0
they are much closer to @entity2 than is @entity10 -- it is 228 miles from @entity85 , the capital of @entity79 , to @entity86			1
the great difference is that the three @entity76 states are members of @entity90			1
any @entity2 adventurism in this area could force the enormous choice of either directly confronting @entity2 in its own neighborhood or allowing @entity90 to collapse because we are unwilling to meet our treaty obligations			0
convincing @entity8 that we take seriously his toughness and his determination , and we are prepared to meet it , could be a vital step toward avoiding a future disaster			0
there are some key steps we can take toward achieving that goal : -- first , move to increase the production of oil and gas , thus dramatically lowering the price of oil , thereby cutting into @entity8 's ability to earn hard currency			1
-- second , wean the @entity112 off their dependence on @entity2 natural gas as one of their biggest suppliers , thus lowering @entity8 's ability to exercise influence over the @entity112 community			1
-- third , strengthen the ability of @entity11 to produce its own energy so it has both a healthier economy and no longer relies on @entity8 and @entity2 as its main source of energy			1
-- fourth , strengthen @entity1 military capabilities to show that we recognize that @entity8 is more dangerous than we thought and that we are prepared to strengthen our ability to deal with any threat he might bring to bear , particularly on our @entity90 allies in the @entity130			1
the @entity131 should call on the president to immediately issue an executive order to approve the @entity134 , which will reduce the price of oil worldwide by getting more oil to market faster			0
each drop in the dollars that @entity8 can get weakens his ability to undertake foreign adventures			0
the president should also sign an executive order lifting the ban on selling natural gas to @entity112			0
after all , since the executive order the president issued on thursday indicates this is " a national emergency , " then there are serious things we can do in a national emergency			0
this president has already proven a willingness to use executive orders widely			0
this would be one that would weaken and undermine @entity8 , while also beginning to liberate the @entity112 from dependence on @entity2			1
@entity15 should also immediately open closed offshore and federal land to drill for natural gas and oil			0
the more oil and gas the @entity1 produces , the further we can drive down costs , leaving the @entity2 weaker and with fewer resources			1
there are 24 liquid natural gas projects tied up in the federal bureaucracy			0
a presidential executive order could liberate them and send the clear signal the @entity1 is prepared to replace @entity2 as the natural gas supplier of last resort			1
this would clearly signal the @entity112 that in the next few years they will have an alternative to being blackmailed by @entity8			0
remember , it was president @entity180 's strategy to drive down the price of oil to $ 11 a barrel that eventually bankrupted the @entity184 and gave @entity184 leader @entity185 no choice but to sign a series of agreements that recognized the decline of the @entity184			0
if @entity33 was both sincere and serious in comparing @entity8 to @entity37 when she related the action in the @entity10 to the action that @entity37 took in @entity194 in 1938 , then she would be demanding that we dramatically strengthen rather than weaken @entity1 defense			1
the president should announce that he is directing the @entity198 to significantly re-evaluate the budget in order to be more than adequately prepared for any possible contingency			0
this would send a signal in the real world that the @entity2 would understand			0
what we have so far is symbolic liberalism offering words , symbolic liberalism flying around the world from capital to capital having meetings , and symbolic liberalism targeting narrowly a handful of people in a way that will have no impact on @entity8			2
what we could have is serious , robust action that would have a genuine and immediate impact and would weaken @entity2 's ability to act aggressively toward its neighbors			1
this is the time to determine , are we serious about confronting @entity8 over the long run ? or after a few symbolic games , is the administration going to accommodate the new reality that @entity8 is creating ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			0

@entity231 : @entity10 action reminds @entity1 that @entity2 has different values , goals , ambitions
he says much of the action taken by the @entity1 so far has involved symbolism , meetings
more effective strategy would involve *vastly* increasing energy production , he says
@entity231 : @entity8 's logic could threaten the independence of the @entity76 states
