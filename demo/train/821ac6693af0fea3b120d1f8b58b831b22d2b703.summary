-- an @entity2 - style theocratic regime in turbulent @entity3 would be a nightmare for @entity5 and a dream for @entity7 , but it 's a no - go scenario for some scholars of the @entity9			1
some analysts doubt this vision because the @entity12 -- the outlawed but popular militant @entity14 @entity13 opposition movement in @entity3 -- appears to lack the clout and widespread support to seize power at present			1
experts also say the movement is less extreme than the hardline clerics who rule @entity2			2
one analyst said the @entity3 military appears to be trying to reconsolidate its power and maintain what has been a " military dictatorship in civilian garb			2
" just friday , @entity2 supreme leader ayatollah @entity27 praised the @entity29 uprisings in @entity3 and @entity30 and said they echo his country 's revolution			1
there is an easy parallel between the 1979 @entity37 revolution in @entity2 that toppled the shah and the current uprising in @entity3 : both reflected popular discontent across the societies over hated and autocratic rule			1
but other political factors deflate this scenario , analysts say			0
@entity47 , visiting fellow at the @entity48 , said that first and foremost , there is no figure in the @entity12 who is equivalent to @entity52 , the @entity53 cleric who led the toppling of the @entity2 government			1
" the @entity12 is taking , so far , kind of a back seat , " he said of its role in @entity3 , which is predominantly @entity14			1
" they are late to the game			0
" @entity61 , a senior fellow for @entity63 foreign policy at the @entity64 , agrees that there is no " charismatic and identifiable leader " of an @entity37 opposition			0
@entity52 , she said , was " such a threat " that he had been exiled to @entity69			2
@entity47 said that when @entity52 was in @entity70 , he said he did n't want to establish an @entity37 republic , but that turned out to be a lie			1
@entity74 said the @entity2 regime led by @entity52 murderously repressed and sold down the river many in the opposition who supported the uprising in the 1970s			1
" the specter of that is very frightening to many @entity3 , " she said			0
" @entity3 are very nervous about repeating what happened in @entity2			1
" @entity84 , director of the security and defense studies at the @entity88 - based @entity87 , sees the @entity12 as a moderate force compared with a movement like @entity91			2
he points to @entity92 , where the new government has reached out to the @entity12 's political wing , and envisions the group having a public role to play in a new @entity3			1
at the same time , he doubts the @entity12 would have influence over the army , and thinks the military would not allow them to seize power			0
" i do n't think it 's a realistic assumption that they will seize power , " he said			0
@entity103 , deputy director of the @entity9 program at the @entity105 , wrote in a commentary friday that the " @entity3 military faces a range of challenges that defy easy resolution " and the " debate over the future role of the @entity12 is a prime example			1
" " no representative system can take root in @entity3 without the @entity12 's participation			1
but , after spending the last half century battling @entity13 political forces , the military leadership will have trouble overcoming its deep disdain for the @entity12 , " @entity117 said			0
@entity47 points out that there 's an impression among observers that the next @entity3 will probably have a more @entity126 government and that the opposition leaders who will find their way into government could be less hospitable to @entity63 interests			2
in contrast , he said , there 's not much fear of an @entity2 - style theocracy at the moment			2
he said @entity2 has n't succeeded in exporting its revolution			2
its neighbor @entity139 , which like @entity2 is majority @entity53 , has n't evolved into a theocracy			2
@entity74 said @entity3 are wary of extremism and fear succumbing to the violence that raged last decade in @entity139			0
also , the army plays a more moderating role			0
she said one big difference between @entity2 and @entity3 are their economies			1
@entity2 has a lot of oil , and it can afford to be " more reactionary and revolutionary			0
" @entity3 is dependent on tourism , shipping through the @entity154 and trade with neighboring countries			0
" these types of things bind it to more moderate policies , " @entity74 said			1
the calculation made by subsequently assassinated president @entity162 in the 1970s to forge peace with @entity164 reflects this moderation			0
@entity74 said it has been a " cold peace " between @entity164 and @entity3 , but leaders have concluded it serves @entity3 better than conflict , instability and failure			0
@entity47 says @entity162 's " bold and risky move " was made to stop the endless state of war that began in the 1940s and help create prosperity			0
because of @entity3 repression , there are uncertainties about the @entity12			1
@entity47 said it 's unclear to what extent and why people have supported the @entity12 in the past			2
is that because it opposed @entity186 ? @entity187 is that because people philosophically support the group			0
" i do n't think we know right now , " he said			0
could there be a future autocracy in @entity3 , even if it does n't resemble @entity2 's theocratic regime ? @entity0 's @entity194 , the foreign affairs expert who hosts an hour - long sunday show on world affairs , says the military seems to have made a decision to try to maintain and reconsolidate power and it will sacrifice anyone to do that , even @entity186			1
he said it could be a " very unsatisfactory outcome			0
" " what is clear over the last three days is that they caused chaos and are now going to step in to restore order , " he said of @entity3 's military			1
if that cycle plays out , he says , " the entire movement will have been in vain			0

the @entity2 *template* does n't apply to @entity3 , analysts say
there 's no charismatic figure in the @entity12 like @entity52
@entity3 's economic *environment* lends itself to moderate policies
