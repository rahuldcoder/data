-- two high school students -- managing editors at their school newspaper in @entity3 , @entity4 -- wrote a distressing op - ed that appeared recently in the @entity7			1
@entity8 , a junior , and @entity10 , a sophomore , had undertaken a herculean task			2
after bonding over the discovery that both were being treated for depression , they linked up with other journalism students and gathered highly personal stories about mental illness from teenagers in their school district			1
incredibly , all their subjects agreed to be identified			2
these were reporters who did their homework , and subjects who saw the merit of going public about their experiences with everything from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and drug abuse			0
the two student editors were gearing up to devote an entire edition of the paper to telling the mental health stories of their peers			1
and then , the head of their school put the kibosh on the project			2
the stories were not to be published lest they trigger bullying or further mental health problems for the afflicted students			1
i read the two girls ' story the morning after a remarkable night of witnessing just the opposite -- the progress that comes when school administrators encourage their students to speak and write openly about mental illness			1
high school students in the tiny @entity58 town of @entity59 , @entity60 , population 14,687 , for six years have been competing in an essay contest called " @entity63			1
" the project got started when two @entity59 high school health teachers teamed up with the leader of a local mental health support group to invite kids to compete for annual prizes of $ 250 , $ 150 and $ 100			1
the prize money comes from the local chapter of the @entity72			0
i was one of four judges , which has given me a ringside seat to this work in progress at changing attitudes			0
importantly , if you include our contest coordinator who oversees the project , three in our group of five are mental health professionals who can spot when an essayist has n't gotten the facts right , or displays red flags that should be brought to the attention of a parent			1
all of us have a connection to mental health issues , whether it is in a lifelong professional devotion , our own mental illness , or the care of a loved one			1
on wednesday night , we honored our latest crop of courageous teenage writers in a meeting room at a state mental health center in @entity103 , @entity60			1
@entity104 read his third - place essay , " @entity106 " and taught the audience a little something about the pain of feeling different			0
" imagine being called @entity113 in the hallway just because you have to work harder at school than someone else , " he said , referring to the derogatory slang that some students throw at special education kids			2
as far back as @entity104 can remember , kids thought he was weird because he was " a little bit different			2
" but he also thinks having adhd has made him " a very caring person when others have a problem or issue			0
" i mean , can you top that , or what ? @entity127 read her second - place winning essay , " @entity130			0
" " try to put yourself in their shoes , " she said of people struggling with a mental health condition			1
" imagine going through each day , each hour , fighting the voices screaming in your head , as if you have schizophrenia			0
" @entity139 , the first - prize winner , began to sob just a few paragraphs into reading her gripping essay about what she called the " alternate reality " of two weeks in a psychiatric hospital			0
i offered to read the rest , and @entity139 stood beside me as i shared her words about " going from @entity149 visit to @entity149 visit " in her struggle with a worsening depression			0
after her last line -- " i am living proof that things do get better ; all you need is guidance " -- @entity139 got a standing ovation from the audience of parents , siblings , friends and local residents			0
and then she posed for a picture with her $ 250 check , and took a seat next to her mom , who wrapped her arms around @entity139 and planted two big kisses on her right cheek			0
parents or guardians of our winners always show up for the big night			0
the contest drew 36 entries in 2008 , its launch year			0
that inched up to 40 in 2009 and then a record - breaking 92 by 2013 , just months after students in another @entity60 school got a crash course on mental illness in the @entity184 massacre			1
this year , 149 @entity59 students submitted essays -- another record			2
the wisdom , honesty and emotion of the entries compounds with each cycle			0
mental illness in children : where to turn what 's always striking is how wide a population is affected by mental illness in such a tiny community			2
the two student editors in @entity3 observed the same thing on a larger scale			0
@entity203 , an essay contest judge and executive director of the @entity205 , a division of @entity60 's @entity206 and @entity207 , said kids suffering with mental illness are craving information that can help them make sense of what they 're feeling			1
@entity3 , consider the great results of the open conversation about teenage mental health in @entity59			1
your high school editors are on to something .			2
