-- a book company said wednesday that it will release on september 11 a firsthand account of the raid that killed @entity5 leader @entity4			1
@entity6 , director of marketing and publicity for @entity8 , a subsidiary of @entity10 , said the book was written by a @entity12 under a pen name			1
although @entity0 has confirmed the name of the seal , the network agreed not to publish his identity at the request of @entity21 officials who said the information might lead to other seals on the raid being identified through social media links			1
after the @entity29 and @entity30 reported the seal 's name online thursday , many other websites , including the @entity27 and @entity28 , published his identity			1
the book is entitled " no easy day : the firsthand account of the mission that killed @entity4			1
" the former @entity12 seal was on the @entity4 raid , according to @entity21 officials			1
the 36 - year - old chief petty officer left the @entity12 as a highly - decorated commando in april , but he could be subject to criminal prosecution , they said			1
his military awards include five @entity39 with a special combat designation and a @entity41			0
he led others under fire at least seven times , @entity21 officials said			0
the book account includes the stealth helicopter crash that could have killed the author and his teammates , his publisher said			1
@entity52 @entity51 has not reviewed the book or approved it , a @entity21 official said			1
officials only recently became aware the former @entity12 was writing a book but were told it encompasses more than just the raid and includes vignettes from training and other missions			1
they would like to see a copy , the official said , to make sure no classified information is released or the book contains any information that might out one of the team members			1
officials have been told that some of the profits are going to charity			0
former @entity72 officers slam @entity73 over leaks on @entity4 killing about two dozen @entity52 special operations members and two helicopters were involved in the raid early may 2 , 2011 , in @entity78 , @entity79 , that killed @entity4			1
the raid occurred in a span of 38 minutes , after @entity84 reports of repeated sightings of a tall man doing " prison yard walks " around the yard of the housing compound in @entity78 , which was under constant surveillance , an official said on condition of anonymity a few days after the raid			1
@entity52 authorities did not definitively determine beforehand that the man was @entity4 , but they eventually concluded that there was enough evidence to go through with the operation			0
one helicopter made a hard landing when it apparently came too close to a wall			0
it landed inside the western side of the compound with its tail rotor over the southern wall			0
the first man killed in the mission -- which the @entity52 official said was code - named @entity110 -- was the @entity111 courier who had worked for @entity4			0
he was shot dead after a brief gunfight in a guest house			0
from that point on , it is believed no other shots were fired at the @entity52 forces , the official said -- which contrasts with early @entity52 government reports describing the operation as a " firefight			0
" the troops then moved into the compound 's three - story main building , where they shot and killed the courier 's brother			2
as they went upstairs and around barricades , one of @entity4 's sons rushed at them and was killed			2
neither of these men had weapons either on them or nearby , the official said			0
the @entity52 official said that the team then entered the third - floor room where @entity4 was , along with his @entity140 wife and several young children			0
the @entity5 leader was moving , possibly toward one of the weapons that were in the room , when he was shot , first in the chest and then in the head			0
he never had a gun in hand but posed an imminent threat , according to the @entity52 official			0
@entity4 's body was flown to the aircraft carrier @entity154 , then in the @entity155			2
after dna tests and further confirmations of his identity , he was buried at sea within 12 hours of his killing " in conformance with @entity165 precepts and practices , " @entity157 press secretary @entity156 said			2
president @entity73 met with some of the @entity12 , often referred to as @entity167 and officially as the @entity167 , at @entity168 , @entity169			1
opinion : are ' @entity172 ' attacks on @entity73 bogus ? the @entity52 raid , which was conducted without the knowledge of @entity79 , enraged the @entity79 public and embarrassed its military			2
three months later , 15 members of @entity167 were killed in a helicopter crash in @entity179			0
@entity181 - winning director @entity180 and screenwriter @entity182 are working on a movie about the raid			1
" @entity186 " is about the decade - long hunt for @entity4			0
@entity180 and @entity182 are the team behind the 2008 @entity181 - winning film " the @entity188			0
" the new movie was said to be set for release just before the election , but after @entity192 complained that it was a pro-obama ad , it was pushed back until december			1
there is some dispute over whether it was ever meant for release before december			2
the movie has been the focus of a @entity200 partisan fight since last summer			2
the @entity21 's inspector general began an inquiry after questions were raised by rep. @entity204 , @entity206 - @entity205			2
he demanded investigations by the @entity21 and @entity84 inspectors general into what , if any , classified information about @entity211 tactics , techniques and procedures were leaked to the filmmakers , calling the film a " potentially dangerous collaboration " between liberal filmmakers and the administration			0
some of what those investigations found did show collaboration between the administration and the filmmakers , but @entity21 and @entity157 officials have said it 's no different than what they give many filmmakers and news reporters on a regular basis			0
@entity84 ' overlooked ' @entity4 movie documents @entity0 's @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			1

new : although @entity0 has confirmed the seal 's name , the network agreed not to publish his identity
the book is **due** to come out september 11
the @entity12 author uses a pen name , the publisher says
*controversial* movie about the raid **due** out in december
