-- on june 17 and 18 , the political world 's focus will be on @entity3 , where the @entity4 will take place			1
although this is a region defined by its violent history , the summit is already proving to be one of the most complex and wide - ranging security operations @entity3 has ever seen			1
thousands of additional police officers are being brought in from @entity12 , @entity13 and the @entity14 to assist			2
during the 2005 event , which took place in @entity19 and was the last @entity6 in the @entity20 , four @entity16 - inspired men detonated bombs on the @entity23 transport network , killing 52 people and themselves			1
although any kind of incident at or around the summit venue itself remains unlikely , there is the risk of a terrorist attack timed to distract from the event			1
but this year , unlike the 2005 attack , the focus is on a very different kind of group			1
if you thought @entity3 's troubles were a thing of the past , you 'd be forgiven			1
a brutal terrorist campaign over 35 years that saw almost 4,000 deaths came to an end thanks to a hard - fought political process			2
what that took should not be underestimated			2
years of painstaking mediation and negotiation , risky moves by brave politicians on all sides and the crucial involvement of the @entity50 saw hope prevail , despite the occasional setback that threatened destabilization			2
communities on both sides of the social and political divide cautiously welcomed the peace process and its negotiated settlements			2
the " troubles " seemed finally to be over			0
former paramilitaries agreed to lay down their arms , and once - sworn enemies eventually learned to share power			2
yet , peace in @entity3 is still described by many as fragile			1
in recent times , riots , gunfire and petrol bombs have returned to the streets			0
the " flag protests , " which defined the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013 , have again highlighted the inherent divisions in @entity3 society			1
the @entity80 flag , flown proudly over @entity81 for so long , was lowered after a vote by the @entity83			0
some among @entity3 's @entity85 community were outraged			1
but it is not the rioters and flag protesters who pose the most persistent threat to this fragile peace			2
another group watches from the sidelines			0
they are the " dissident " @entity96 , splinter groups that have grown in size and impact since the peace process saw the end of the @entity102 as we once knew it			1
the dissidents are responsible for a growing wave of low - level bombings , shootings and threats across the region			2
they insist that only armed resistance can force @entity20 's withdrawal from @entity3 and lead to a united @entity3			1
while most people in @entity3 view the peace process as having brought stability , the dissidents reject it			1
though tactically proficient , the dissidents lack strategic acumen			0
on the surface , they are united by the idea of " brits out , " with aspirations to achieve a united @entity14 through violence and their disdain for the @entity123 leadership and the peace process that it has embraced			0
traditionally , dissidents have been split by local differences , ideological divergences , petty jealousies and competitive personalities			0
" @entity132 " came to describe a range of groups			2
one calls itself the @entity134			0
then there 's the @entity139 and @entity136 , @entity137 for @entity3 volunteers			1
there has been talk of a merger to unite the disparate factions			0
in july , the " new ira " was announced : a merger of the @entity134 , the @entity147 - based @entity146 and other previously non-aligned @entity96			2
but the @entity139 stayed aloof from the alliance			0
the new group 's members and supporters may number in the few hundreds , but it seems their ranks are growing			0
they have killed soldiers , police officers and most recently a prison officer			2
they continue to target @entity3 police stations , with weaponry of growing sophistication			1
they shoot suspected inner - city drug dealers north and south of the @entity3 border to help embed themselves in their communities while simultaneously undermining the police			1
these dissident factions are capable of causing sometimes extensive disruption with actual or hoax improvised explosive devices			0
just last year , police in @entity3 recovered an armor - piercing rocket that included the plastic explosive semtex in the city of @entity147			1
we have monitored the dissidents ' steady rise , logging thousands of events and documents in the process			0
what does it all add up to ? in short , the threat posed by dissident @entity132 groups is evolving , and probably for the worse			1
their recruitment efforts continue to expand			0
many of these new recruits belong to a different generation from their forerunners			0
they were n't even born at the time of the 1994 @entity102 cease - fire , and some of the older members are senior @entity195 members who bring much needed political acumen , as well as expertise in bomb - making , recruitment , training and targeting			1
their activities span the country , north and south , with mostly urban concentrations in @entity81 , @entity147 , @entity205 and @entity206			0
there is increasing evidence of training and recruitment in the @entity211 , with evidence for some logistical support appearing in @entity12			0
true , they do n't have the kind of support once enjoyed by the @entity102			1
but the dissidents do n't just acknowledge their lack of popular support			0
they revel in their " noble isolation			0
" terrorism analysts have come to associate this particularly dangerous kind of thinking with @entity226 terrorist groups , not @entity227			2
yet @entity3 's newest dissidents are a different breed and pose new threats			1
in responding to recent dissident activity , @entity3 's politicians have been vocal			1
we hear , time and again , " nobody wants a return to the old days , " " they have no mandate " and " they will never win			0
" those same @entity239 © d responses never deterred the @entity102			1
in defiance , and in an appeal for support , the dissidents claim the ability to bring their " struggle to a successful conclusion through military operations			0
" the 100th anniversary of the @entity249 , when the progenitors of @entity227 were executed by occupying @entity20 forces , is in 2016			0
just like their @entity102 predecessors , the dissidents draw their inspiration and legitimacy from an unyielding view of the past yet find a steady stream of eager recruits in the present			1
in the years leading up to 2016 , it is likely that the dissidents will try to strengthen their support and perceived legitimacy through a proliferation of attacks			0
they will promote themselves as the true heirs of the 1916 republicans , heirs who can finally bring about a united @entity14 through one last campaign of force			0
the @entity102 itself was once just a ragtag bunch of self - appointed guardians of an age - old mission that found relevance in contemporary events			1
a remorseless logic in what the dissidents say reveals why they are unpredictable , dangerous and ambitious			0
we have become dangerously complacent about the dissident @entity227			0
we hope we are wrong , and the @entity6 in @entity282 does not become a platform on which they can bring international attention to their campaign			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			2

writers : @entity6 in @entity3 presents a security *nightmare* as @entity102 rises again
@entity16 - inspired terrorists killed 52 people in @entity23 during 2005 summit in @entity19
writers say that this year , new energized @entity102 groups are an underestimated threat
this is not the @entity304 of old , they say ; these are *fanatical* splinter groups
