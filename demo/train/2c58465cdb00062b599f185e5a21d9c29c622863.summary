the boy 's stories are heartbreaking : " my dad drinks and hits me ... my mom chose drugs over me ... my home on the reservation is n't a safe place for me to be , " wrote @entity8			0
his request seems reasonable -- send a few dollars to help @entity10 to keep " kids like me safe ... so we do n't have to live this way anymore			1
" the story , begging for help , is part of massive national marketing campaign involving 30 million pieces of a mail a year			1
and it 's a successful one , raising more than $ 50 million last year			1
but @entity8 does n't exist			2
it 's not just a pseudonym to protect a child			0
the story is a fabrication , a compiling of events that may or may not have happened to paint a broad picture that @entity30 leaders say does not exist			1
officials at @entity10 -- a 200 - person boarding school in @entity32 , @entity33 , that 's affiliated with a @entity35 charity based in @entity36 -- say they send out waves of mailings three or four times a year			1
the latest , a @entity41 - oriented mailer , was sent in early november , according to the school 's director of communications			2
the packets include calendars , personalized return address stickers , notepads , elaborate stickers and a so - called " @entity49 , " a @entity30 handicraft that by tradition gives its owners good dreams			1
the @entity41 appeal introduced " @entity55			0
" a year ago when her family brought her to the school , the letter says , " ( y ) ou could see the hopelessness she felt in her dark brown eyes			1
" now , the letter goes on , " her big bright smile reveals how her life has changed			2
" but again , " @entity55 , " is more than a pseudonym			0
the girl whose life is described in the letter does not exist			1
according to its financial statements , @entity10 raised more than $ 51 million last year from millions of @entity71 who donated because of those mailings			1
@entity74 began receiving complaints about mailings like this more than two years ago			2
when asked about @entity8 's letter , @entity78 , the director of development , wrote us that there was no such student			2
" the name ' @entity83 ' is fictitious , " he wrote , " but unfortunately , his story is not			0
" the letter , he added , " is a true story of the very real and challenging situations that far too many children face not only in the @entity30 community , but in families found in every sphere of society			1
" he said it was n't the " intention to disparage in any way the @entity30 community			1
" but some @entity71 say there is deliberate disparagement and that it 's a marketing technique			0
a half - hour drive away from @entity10 's is the @entity101 reservation in central @entity33 , where its vice chairman , @entity102 , scoffed at the fundraising letter			1
" that 's how they get their money , " he told @entity74			0
" to me , they make the @entity109 look bad			0
" @entity110 , president of the @entity111 that aims to strengthen and support native communities , went further			0
he termed the fundraising letter and the admission that the child is nonexistent as " poverty porn			1
" " they are raising money in the name of @entity109 , using the worst of poverty porn of all @entity71 country to raise money on all our social ills , " said @entity110 , whose @entity118 - based group represents six @entity30 nonprofit organizations			1
it seems that the money being raised is being used for the right reasons , as far as @entity74 could see			0
we were given a tour of the school but were not allowed to film			0
the complex , on the banks of the @entity135 , looks like a nice place and the children seemed happy , well - fed and well - housed			0
we tried unsuccessfully to interview the leadership of @entity10 's			1
the communications director , @entity140 , first invited us to meet the school president at the small museum operated by the school			0
the president , @entity144 , acknowledged that the mailings " push the edge " of marketing and asking about them " is a legitimate question			0
" but @entity140 told us to stop			0
" you do n't have permission to record in any way , shape or form , " she said			0
according to its own financial statement for 2013 , @entity10 's has abundant assets			2
cash on hand was listed at more than $ 122 million in june 2013 , an increase of more than $ 18.5 million over the previous year .			2

@entity10 raises over $ 50 million annually from donations
it sends waves of mailings across the country asking for help
a @entity30 leader denounces the *tactics* , calling them " poverty porn "
the school admits that the *author* of a begging letter does not exist
