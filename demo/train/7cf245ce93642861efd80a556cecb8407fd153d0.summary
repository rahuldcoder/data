@entity0 , @entity1 -- the recent convictions of @entity1 cricketers @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 brings to an end this sad chapter on corruption , however , the full story will continue as names of other players were also mentioned during the trial ; they will be investigated and further action may also be taken			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 sold themselves for a relatively modest amount of money and in the process destroyed their careers and brought cricket and @entity1 into disrepute			2
the fact that three players , possibly more , were involved is worrying ; none of them considered that what they were doing was not only wrong but also dishonest and illegal			1
in @entity1 , where cricket provides a welcome distraction from the internal security threats and the terrible natural disasters the country has faced in recent years , there is a sense of outrage and anger at being let down by people who were role models for hundred of thousands of fans			2
i believe that the convictions for the players were correct			1
in addition to the jail sentences and fines they have all been banned for five years from any form of cricket			0
i do feel sorry for teenager @entity8 ; while i am not convinced that he was coerced or pressurized , he was naive and in all probability did not fully appreciate what he was doing or its consequences due to his background and education			0
@entity6 and @entity7 must never again play for @entity1 ; i would treat @entity8 's case with more sympathy but it will be very difficult for him to get back into international cricket in five years time			0
i am not happy with the sentence given to agent @entity59 ; it should have been much tougher			0
for me the important question is how did this happen ; what lessons did we learn and what should the game do going forward ? it was very clear that the three players did not understand the ethos of the game or what the spirit of cricket means			1
they also callously ignored the @entity73 on corruption and matching fixing			0
the @entity73 has an excellent program for awareness and prevention of corruption ; so where did the message fail to get through ? the @entity73 works in partnership with every cricket board to educate the players on corruption			1
in this case it is clear that the @entity85 did not do enough			1
this was a major failing and the @entity85 should not only accept responsibility for this but undertake to ensure that it does not happen again			1
the team management had concerns about the players ' agent but failed to do anything about it			1
there had been rumors about the team 's performance in @entity99 before the tour to @entity101 , yet no measures were taken to tighten the controls around the players and stop outside influences from having access to them			1
when the @entity108 broke the story , the @entity85 went into denial implying this was a conspiracy against the @entity1 team ; this forced the @entity73 to take action against the players something the @entity85 should itself have done			1
after the match fixing scandals in the late 1990s the @entity85 worked very hard to eradicate corruption from the game			1
certainly , until 2006 when my term as president of the @entity73 came to an end , i was confident that the @entity85 and specifically its chairmen during my time , made great efforts to prevent and monitor corrupt practices in @entity1 cricket			1
but things have gone dreadfully wrong in the past three to four years and @entity1 cricket has paid the price of a weak governance structure			0
the chairman is appointed by the president of the country without a consultation process with any of the key stakeholders in the game			0
the @entity85 chairman is not accountable to anyone ; some years ago the @entity85 chairman also assumed the position of chief executive and downgraded the role of the ceo to chief operating officer ; this destroyed whatever little checks and balances existed within the @entity85			1
without a sound governance structure and professional management , corruption will remain a huge risk for @entity1 cricket			0
i do not believe that corruption is endemic in cricket ; almost all of the @entity156 playing countries have a robust anti-corruption regime			0
during my time with the @entity73 i met with @entity158 , the then chairman of the @entity159 , for one to one briefings on corruption			0
he was confident that match fixing was not taking place but was not so confident about ' spot fixing ' where one or more players could be corrupted ; this was difficult if not impossible to monitor			2
these incidents can be avoided by the national cricket boards having a robust education program for the players ; appointing mentors from within the team to help and guide new players and having an effective anti-corruption units to monitor domestic as well as international cricket			2
most of the boards already do this ; unfortunately the @entity85 's anti-corruption program was not effective			1
the education program for the players should start when they first start playing domestic first class cricket			2
for its part , the @entity73 must engage with the governments of countries such as @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity1 where a very large unregulated betting industry exits			0
the epicenter of cricket betting is @entity186 ; hundreds of millions of dollars are bet on each match , particularly when @entity186 is playing			0
the @entity159 and @entity192 is not able to access the betting odds being offered or monitor suspicious bets being placed			0
unless betting is regulated in these countries it will remain very difficult to stop players being approached			2
i would also like to see the @entity73 have the powers to carry out an annual review of the anti-corruption processes of every @entity156 playing country ; testing the players and relevant officials through annual on - line questionnaires to assess how well they understand the @entity73 on corruption			2
where players get low scores the @entity73 should have the authority to require the player 's board to take remedial action and re-training of the board 's officials in - charge of educating the players			2
in case of extreme failure on the part of a board to demonstrate that it has a robust anti-corruption program , the country should be suspended from international cricket until the @entity224 is satisfied that the particular country has put a robust anti-corruption regime in place			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			0

the convictions of three @entity234 cricketers is not the end of the story
other players names were mentioned in the trial and they will also be investigated
the @entity85 should accept full responsibility for what has happened
