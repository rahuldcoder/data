-- on paper , @entity1 was a success story throughout her 20s			1
she had her own home , a new car , a large , beloved collection of vinyl records and a six - figure salary from her job in the pharmaceutical industry			1
but she did n't love what she was doing			2
" i bought my first house when i was 21 but i was n't happy			0
i kind of knew that all along but i did it because of financial stability , " @entity1 said			1
" i was afraid to think outside of the box because of money			0
" it took losing her job in 2010 for her to change her tune and launch a business doing something she enjoyed			1
since 2011 , @entity1 has been combining her enthusiasm for vintage records and bookbinding through her small business , @entity27			1
she finds old records , repurposes them into book covers and makes them into journals for music lovers			1
" everyone knows i was always making trinkets , " @entity1 says			1
" it was n't too hard of a transition for me since i had both the craft and business side			1
" to make it happen , she had to leave corporate @entity39 behind and downsize from her three - bedroom home to a one - bedroom apartment			0
now , she lives in a barn on her parents ' property in a small town in @entity46 , dividing her time between raising an infant and building a business			1
it 's worth the sacrifice to have control over her work and her life , said @entity1 , 34			1
besides , now she has an entire studio where she gives old records a second life			1
" i 'm such a different person now , " she said			0
@entity1 always has been interested in vintage items and antiques			1
as a teen , when her friends were buying cds and cassettes , she was sifting through boxes of 15 - cent records at yard sales and flea markets			2
when she left her parents ' home , she took her large collection with her			0
she pursued a bachelor 's degree from @entity70 in @entity71 and later earned her mba from @entity73 in @entity71			0
she continued to collect vinyl as her career took off			0
when the records became too scratched for listening , she did n't want to get rid of them , but how could she use them ? while she was looking for a journal to jot down ideas , " something clicked " and she was inspired to find a way to incorporate her languishing records into a notebook			2
" i got in my car , drove to @entity86 and sat in the aisle reading almost everything i found about bookbinding , " she said			0
she began crafting journals for friends and family and giving them as gifts to loved ones			0
after @entity1 was laid off , she decided to turn her journal - making hobby into a career			1
to fund start - up costs , she did temporary contract work and drew from her savings so she could eventually devote all her efforts to @entity27			1
she crops the album covers herself and contracts out the laser - cutting of the vinyl			0
she sews the journal pages together and attaches them to the cover using an acid - free adhesive			0
the average price of one of @entity1 's journals is $ 35 , depending on the price of the vinyl			1
custom designs requiring records that are hard to obtain cost a bit more			2
she used to think of them as simply journals , but over time she 's seen people use them for a variety of purposes			0
" people use them for wedding guest sign - in books , scrapbooks , drawing , books to store concert ticket stubs and photos -- stuff i never thought of , " @entity1 says			1
after being in business for six months , she realized she would have to scale back living expenses to get the business off the ground			1
she and her boyfriend ( now her husband ) moved into an apartment and she sold many of her belongings			2
after two years in the apartment , they moved into her parents ' barn to accommodate their growing family			2
her life is much simpler now than when she was a " corporate , hungry , heel - wearing person , " she said			0
she can work and focus on her daughter while tending to new passions , like gardening and beekeeping			0
running her business is a full - time job , even if it does n't provide enough income to support her family ; her husband has an outside job			1
there have been the typical ups and downs of being a small - business owner and entrepreneur , especially in learning how to market her products , she said			2
but " not a day goes by " when she regrets her decision			0
her vinyl journals are sold in stores across the @entity39 and @entity166			0
she used to attend craft shows to sell her product and find retailers , but as sales have grown through her website , she has been able to travel less			0
her success has led her to pursue new business ventures , too , including an apparel line , @entity175 , named for her daughter , that will launch next month			2
her dream now is to see her product on the shelves of larger retailers , like @entity179 and @entity180			0
" either way , " she says , " it 's exciting finally having my own business			2

through @entity27 , @entity1 *transforms* old records into notebooks
@entity1 launched her business after losing her job in the pharmaceutical industry
to get business off the ground , she moved to scale back on living expenses
