-- after a contentious year , an embattled president @entity1 and an unpopular @entity2 are each hoping for better things in 2014			1
both parties leave @entity5 with many big issues unresolved and many battles ahead			1
it 's time to consider what some of the big stories of 2014 may be			1
will immigration reform fly ? millions of immigrants are desperately waiting to see whether they will be able to obtain legal status in this country			1
immigration reform has stalled in the @entity16 after a sweeping bill finally passed in the @entity18 with bipartisan support			1
initially listening to the warnings of tea party republicans , speaker of the house @entity20 did n't move on the bill			2
at most , he argued that he would push for smaller versions of the bill that dealt with issues like border security			2
but as 2013 came to a close , the mood seemed to change on @entity30			2
the speaker spoke some tough words that suggested he might take a different direction in 2014			2
his decision to hire @entity35 , who had worked on immigration reform in 2006 and 2007 while on the staff of sen. @entity38 , also sent a strong message to conservative groups			1
passing immigration reform would be hugely consequential for millions of potential @entity43 citizens			1
and legislation could have big ramifications on the electoral map			0
without a bill , @entity2 will never win over @entity49 voters , a massive portion of the current and future electorate that is currently trending @entity52			1
if @entity2 shifted course and took this issue off the table , they could be much more competitive in key states of the @entity57			1
will @entity52 lose control of the @entity18 ? this will be the marquee political event of the year			2
over the past few months there has ongoing speculation about whether this will be a " wave " election that shows a voter mandate about the direction of politics			0
initially , during the height of the 2013 budget battles , some experts thought that @entity52 were going to seize the momentum from @entity2 , who were plummeting in the polls , to regain control of the @entity16 and work with the @entity16 to pass @entity1 's second - term agenda			1
a recent wave of retirements has also given @entity52 some hope they could pick up new seats			0
however , since the fiasco surrounding the introduction of the @entity84 website , the tide seemed to shift back toward @entity2			1
there are three questions surrounding the election			2
first , will majority power shift in either chamber ? second , even if control remains the same , will the election alter the vote count in the @entity16 and @entity18 in a way that makes conditions slightly easier for either party to move legislation ? finally , how will the parties spin the results , as they seek to create the perception that the election has bigger implications for one party or the other ? a rare chance to reform the @entity105 ? changing the way that our national security institutions work has proven to be a near impossibility			1
as president @entity113 said in his farewell address in 1959 , the military - industrial complex , with all the vested interests that line up behind existing military programs , makes it difficult to effect major change			1
but , in the wake of the @entity119 story , this year is different and a window for reform might have emerged			2
the revelations that flowed from the multiple leaks about the @entity105 surveillance programs have been extraordinarily damaging			0
the biggest blow has come from international allies who are furious that their leaders and citizens were under surveillance			0
many of the president 's most ardent supporters have expressed deep disappointment with the commander - in - chief and are insisting on new regulations			2
a federal judge struck a huge blow to the @entity105 by deeming much of the collection of meta - data unconstitutional , while the fallout among international allies from the news that their leaders were being monitored has threatened key relations			0
an advisory panel to @entity1 has recommended sweeping reforms that would create stronger safeguards on what the @entity105 can do			0
@entity1 ended the year strongly suggesting that he will support the reforms			0
most likely , the window for reform will close quickly as new threats to the @entity43 emerge			2
this would be the year @entity153 and the president could potentially restore some balance between the imperatives of national security and of civil liberties			1
who will win the @entity2 civil war ? perhaps the biggest battle that @entity2 face is among themselves			1
as the year ended , the internal party conflict intensified when @entity20 spoke out against the tea party @entity2 who had caused him so much trouble over the course of the year			1
right - wing organizations , the speaker said , had " lost all credibility			0
" he castigated this faction for the damage they had inflicted on their own party and warned that they were more concerned about scoring political points than doing what was best for the country			0
business groups have started to mobilize , as they did in a special election in @entity178 , to challenge right - wing republicans			0
tea party republicans are taking this lying down			0
the attacks have only seemed to energize them			0
the @entity184 reported that at a meeting of 150 tea party activists in @entity189 's @entity188 in @entity190 , a kickoff dinner funded by the @entity193 brothers , one attendee dismissed reports of their falling popularity : " i think it 's wishful thinking on the part of the leadership of the @entity2			1
" at this and other meetings , conservative activists have been vowing to double their campaign against @entity2 who have become too comfortable in @entity5			1
indeed , they have taken delight in the fact that @entity208 rep. @entity207 announced that he will challenge sen. @entity209 in a primary			0
in the @entity212 , one @entity163 activist , @entity211 , blasted the @entity2 leadership and called the recent budget deal a " betrayal of the conservatives who fueled the @entity2 ' 2010 midterm shellacking of @entity52			1
" will @entity84 flourish or fail ? the battles over the @entity84 are not over			1
as @entity219 recently argued in @entity220 , 2014 will be filled with all sorts of new attacks on the program			1
the announcement that the administration would temporarily exempt @entity43 whose health insurance is scheduled to be canceled from the individual mandate energized @entity2 calling for such an exemption for all @entity43			1
the decision , according to @entity184 writer @entity232 , " puts the first crack in the individual mandate			0
the question is whether it 's the last			0
" one of the challenges to the health care program is a new lawsuit by individuals living in states that do n't have state - run exchanges			0
the suit is based on the fact that the @entity84 legislation said individuals eligible for subsidies will be identified by state - run exchanges			1
the plaintiffs argue that in states in which the federal exchange is operational rather than a state exchange , subsidies should therefore not be available			0
if successful , this suit would have hugely detrimental effects on the program			0
in @entity190 , @entity254 , and @entity255 there are bills that would create disincentives for people to use the law			0
the fight will be fierce in 2014			0
after a tough start and long rollout , the @entity1 administration needs to get this program into strong shape soon and start having the benefits roll in to people to diminish interest in @entity2 efforts to damage @entity84			1
will @entity1 respond to the lure of @entity272 power ? although president @entity1 began his term as a politician deeply critical of overusing presidential power , a signature of @entity276 's time in the @entity16 , there is more and more evidence that he is moving in the same direction as his predecessor			0
his decision to bring in @entity284 , a former adviser of president @entity285 who championed a highly aggressive use of executive power to push for environmental legislation , suggests that @entity1 is thinking about using his authority more freely			0
over the past year , we have already learned through the @entity105 revelations that @entity1 is much more comfortable with expansive executive power than we previously thought			0
but in 2014 , it is likely that we will see the president use this muscle with domestic issues like climate change , which he has been unable to advance on @entity30			1
the risk of this strategy is that future presidents can easily roll back any gains			0
for the time being , however , @entity1 might just take this gamble , given it might be his last and best opportunity to effect change on the big issues that have eluded him			2
while surprises certainly lie ahead , we can predict that 2014 will pack a powerful punch politically as both parties dig in for the battles on the road leading to the next presidential election			0
we will also learn more about what the 2016 election may look like as some of the potential candidates , most importantly @entity314 and @entity315 , come closer to deciding whether to run			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity322 .			2

@entity322 says 2014 will begin with some major questions on @entity5 's agenda
will immigration reform fly ? will control of either house of @entity153 change ?
who will win the @entity2 civil war ? and how will @entity84 fare under continuing attacks ?
@entity335 : 2014 will also shed light on the issues and candidates likely to shape the 2016 race
