" we , @entity38 women , realize that our continent was torn about by conflict -- we realized that women was used as weapons of war , rape was used as weapon of war , the body of women was used in the battlefield and we said , ' we need to do something for this and nobody can do it for us but ourselves , " @entity6 explains to @entity0			1
having founded @entity34 in 1996 , @entity6 has also been striving for stronger policies for women and for an increase in the number of female politicians in governments			1

two days after i was back to @entity82 and i traveled to @entity83 for one day			0
i came in the morning , i left the next day in the evening			0

" @entity6 's three - prong strategy starts with mobilizing women from all different walks of life			1
" second , we mediate among the different political parties that was coming into conflict , through the women			2

" she adds : " that 's why @entity7 now have , almost 50 % of women in parliament to make a difference			1
