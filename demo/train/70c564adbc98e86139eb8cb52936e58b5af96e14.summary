here 's what you need to know to get caught up : where are the girls ? it 's anyone 's guess			0
@entity4 's leader , @entity23 , said in a video that he was going to sell them into slavery , but it 's unknown whether he has			1
@entity31 spokesman @entity29 rear adm. @entity28 and other officials have said they believe the girls may have been separated into smaller groups , making the task of finding them inordinately more difficult			0

" the search must be in @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , to see if we can find information , " he said			0
what 's being done to find them ? @entity8 has n't given a lot of information about its efforts other than to say that its soldiers have been out in the field , looking for the girls			1
@entity8 police offered a $ 310,000 reward , but there 's no evidence that has turned up any leads			1
the @entity62 and @entity37 have sent advisers to help the @entity8 government find the girls , stage rescue missions and help in the larger fight to defeat @entity4			1

@entity8 president @entity77 has been roundly criticized for waiting three weeks to speak to the nation on efforts to find and free the girls			1
and larger efforts to subdue @entity4 have had little success since @entity77 declared a state of emergency in @entity8 's north one year ago this month			1
what is @entity4 ? @entity8 and @entity62 officials call it a terrorist group dedicated to founding an @entity88 state in @entity8 , which is divided between a largely @entity90 north and a predominantly @entity92 south			1
it has roots , however , in deep - seated animosity in northern @entity8 over poor governance and anger over economic inequality			2
