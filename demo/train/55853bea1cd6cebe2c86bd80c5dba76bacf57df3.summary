-- nobody knows what caused @entity3 to fall out of her seat on a @entity6 roller coaster ride and plunge to her death			1
@entity6 has closed the @entity9 ride amid its investigation into @entity12 's death on friday at its park in @entity14 , @entity6			1
many questions remain unanswered : was her death a freak accident , or a sign of a larger problem ? how risky are roller coasters ? and who 's in charge of keeping theme parks safe ? on monday a medical examiner ruled that @entity12 was killed by multiple traumatic injuries from her fall			1
dramatic accounts of friday 's incident have emerged , with some witnesses describing family members shouting at the scene and others claiming that the woman had raised concerns with the ride operator about whether the lap bar holding her in her seat was secure			1
on sunday , son - in - law @entity39 told @entity0 that he did not hear his mother - in - law mention that her lap bar did not lock properly , contrary to witness accounts reported by @entity0 affiliates			0
opinion : death by ' amusement ' @entity39 and his wife were sitting in front of @entity12 , who was seated by herself on the @entity9 ride			1
details such as conversations between passengers and ride operators are among the things investigators will consider , experts say			2
" you 're going to look at the operations of it , and the human factor , the human part of the equation , " said @entity58 , an amusement ride and device safety consultant			1
" was there an error or omission made by an operator or someone in operations ? " maintenance and design would also be examined , he said , in addition to details such as the rider 's posture and size			0
" there 's no one answer sometimes , " said @entity81 , an accident reconstructionist			0
in @entity88 posts , her sons described the situation as a nightmare			0
there is no federal regulation of theme parks , and critics say @entity12 's death shows that the government needs to keep better tabs on amusement park deaths and injuries and ensure that someone is held responsible when they happen			1
the amusement park industry stresses that its rides are " one of the safest forms of recreation available			1
" the @entity107 , a trade group representing amusement parks , says visitors of fixed - site amusement parks have a 1 in 24 million chance of being seriously injured			2
that would mean it 's more likely you 'll be struck by lightning , die from a bee sting or drown at the beach			0
according to a @entity120 analysis of amusement park injuries , there were just over 1,200 ride - related injuries in 2011 , and about 4 % of those caused serious physical harm			1
roller coaster accidents accounted for about 28 % of the injuries , the council said			2
some industry observers say that amusement parks are loosely regulated , and rules vary from state to state			1
they note that @entity132 will be in charge of conducting its own investigation into @entity12 's death , not an outside independent agency			1
the company said it will be relying on internal and external experts in its investigation and can not speculate on what happened			0
" while the cause of this tragic accident is still unknown , one thing is clear : roller coasters that hurtle riders at extreme speeds along precipitous drops should not be exempt from federal safety oversight , " sen. @entity144 , @entity145 , said in statement monday			2
" a baby stroller is subject to tougher federal regulation than a roller coaster carrying a child in excess of 100 miles per hour			2
" @entity144 has called for greater regulation of amusement parks for more than a decade , arguing that it would help prevent injuries			1
but his measures asking for the @entity163 to step in have never passed			0
earlier this year , researchers from @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 , warned that thousands of children are injured yearly on amusement park rides and called for greater regulation			1
the amusement park industry says that state regulation is the best way to handle safety			1
they argue that there are already many layers that keep riders safe , including mechanical and design standards , state and local governments , insurance companies and private safety firms			0
as the investigation continues , legal analysts say the threat of a lawsuit against @entity132 is looming			1
" as of now , @entity132 is conducting this internal investigation themselves , and also the @entity192 manufacturer of the roller coaster has sent people in to investigate ... and see if there was any kind of defect in the roller coaster when this accident happened , " attorney and legal analyst @entity188 told @entity0			2
" obviously they 're concerned about accountability and liability in terms of someone bringing a civil lawsuit for negligence and perhaps product liability			0
" so , should riders be worried ? @entity58 , who founded a ride safety consulting firm and once headed up safety at several parks , said there are simple steps that visitors can follow			2
when it comes to securing safety restraints , @entity58 said , " as a general rule , it needs to fit snugly near your waistline , above the top of your thighs , so it can hold the passenger in regardless of what kind of forces are applied , and where they 're applied , on the human body			2
" do n't be afraid to ask operators questions , he said			0
and if you do n't like their answers , he said , " you have the right to say , ' i choose now not to ride			0
' " @entity132 chairman and ceo @entity235 hosted a quarterly earnings call monday from the @entity6 theme park , expressing sympathy to @entity12 's family			1
" we 've been here through the weekend to support our team as we work through this tragic event , " he said			0
six flags said it has not experienced a dip in attendance at any of its parks since friday 's incident , but that could change			0
" there is a lag in reaction time after an accident , and there could be a short - to medium - term attendance impact at the affected park , " @entity235 said during monday 's call			0
@entity235 told investors that the ride would remain closed until the investigation is complete			0
" you can rest assured that it will remain closed until we are certain it is safe to ride , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .			0
