-- there are years of shockers			1
there are years of groundbreakers			2
and then there are years of " meh			2
" 2012 was one big stream of meh			2
" @entity9 , " as defined by @entity10 ( which features a weekly " @entity11 " ) , describes " all those things in life that exist at the top of the fat middle of the bell curve of taste			2
" they do n't inspire wonder or excitement			2
they do n't arouse fury or contempt			0
as the @entity25 puts it , they 're " not hot			0
@entity27 allegedly drunk , in a car accident , arrested ? whatever			1
" @entity29 " and all of its @entity31 parodies ? next			0
" @entity32 " ? it was ok			0
2012 : highs and lows of women in @entity37 it was the kind of year in which buzz faded quickly -- if it ever started at all			1
not even @entity40 could shake things up			0
( see ? you yawned when i mentioned " @entity40			0
" ) pop culture is being made , remade , remixed , rebooted and churned up so fast that , sometimes , the only reaction is a slightly exasperated , seen - it - all - before sigh			1
there were exceptions , of course			0
@entity50 blossomed into a major star with her performances in " @entity53 " and " @entity54 " ; the fact that she describes herself as " just really boring " bodes well for her career ( as an actress , not a tabloid staple )			0
@entity60 's dynamic duo -- @entity61 and @entity62 -- seldom missed when skewering the hypocrisies of an over-the - top election campaign			1
moreover , a number of the year 's deaths caused us to catch our breath , including the tragic passings of such notables as @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
usually , though , events went by with the weight of a breeze			1
" @entity83 " was fun the first million or so times you saw it ; by the time its @entity31 counter passed 100 million , it was time to ask @entity81 , what more do you have ? one direction is packing them in , but so did the @entity86 , @entity87 and the @entity88			0
@entity89 may be a sign of the reality tv apocalypse , but there 's a new one of those every six months			1
sure , it 's the nature of pop culture			1
once @entity97 and @entity98 ruled the planet ; now they 're the subject of a much - mocked tv movie			0
still , it 's striking how little from the entertainment world 's 2012 will likely be remembered in a year or two			1
before long , the year will be the subject of one of those @entity108 specials , sandwiched between a @entity110 documentary and " @entity111			1
" and then we 'll glance up , grab the remote and say , " @entity9			0
what else is on ? "			0

year 's entertainment events seldom stood out
many seemed to *repeat* themselves : @entity27 's issues , new *boy* bands
@entity122 was *marked* by tragic deaths , including that of @entity71
but in *general* , pop culture *recycled* so fast the new quickly became old
