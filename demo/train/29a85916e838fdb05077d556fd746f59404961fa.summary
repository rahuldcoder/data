while state and national pageant officials publicly supported her initially , their opinions eventually changed after she continued to make public statements about same - sex marriage			0

she was dethroned in june by @entity38 pageant owner @entity50 amid growing complaints by state officials that she was uncooperative and not meeting her contractual obligations			0
@entity6 filed a lawsuit in @entity55 in august , claiming that her firing was religious discrimination because of her stand against same - sex marriage			2

after the @entity38 pageant , " with her new - found notoriety , an inflated sense of self , and the lure of financial gain available to her , ms. @entity6 turned even further against the @entity5 organization , abandoned her obligations as the @entity5 titleholder , and violated multiple provisions of the contract which governed her reign , " the pageant filing said .			0
