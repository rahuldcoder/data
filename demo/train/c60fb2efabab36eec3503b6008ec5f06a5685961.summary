" but i 'm sure he 's going to play well			0
he 's played well most every week this year			2
i still would n't be surprised if i have a little work to do next week			0

" what the heck ? wow			0
that 's as good as i can play			0
" i just said , ' well , if i 'm going to have a chance , i 'm going to have to birdie two of the last three holes			0
' " newsflash : if you do n't birdie the first one and you 're dormie with two holes to play and you 've got to make two birdies , it gets harder			0
i read it perfectly and the ball went right in the middle and i was just thrilled			0
" despite the win , his first since the @entity86 in january 2010 , @entity26 had little time to celebrate , with his wife @entity88 due to give birth to their third child on monday			2
