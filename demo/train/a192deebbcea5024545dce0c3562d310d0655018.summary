-- the search for a 3 - year - old @entity3 boy began just weeks ago , but police now say that no one had seen him since march -- around when , they believe , he was killed by one or two of his parents			1
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- the father , stepmother and 4 - year - old sister , respectively , of @entity12 -- continued to live in @entity9 's @entity20 apartments for months after the boy 's presumed death , @entity9 police officer @entity8 said monday			1
they did n't leave until the summer , after @entity15 was last spotted in june -- when police now think she was killed , according to @entity8			1
still , the search for the two children , whose bodies have n't been found , did n't begin until november 19			1
" it 's really terrible , as if nobody really cared , " @entity8 said of the time that transpired between the sightings and launch of the search			1
" that 's what we ca n't seem to understand at this point			2
" both @entity36 and @entity37 are now in custody , and blaming each other for the siblings ' deaths			2
the search for their bodies , meanwhile , continues			1
mobile police chief @entity45 told @entity47 's @entity46 on monday that the father " gave us an indication of where the two children buried , " leading to searches for their bodies at two locations over the weekend			1
" our hearts are broken , because these two beautiful children are missing and presumed to be dead , " @entity45 said			1
" we will continue our searches until we locate the bodies and they are properly buried			2
" this weekend , authorities started looking in a rural 12 - mile swath in southeastern @entity59 , about one hour 's drive from @entity9			1
" they think that somehow , maybe , one of the children may have been brought here and dumped , " said @entity61 , @entity59 , sheriff @entity62			2
" but we 're not really sure where to look			0
" @entity62 said that he believes that @entity36 wanted to bury one of the children with a shovel , but tossed the body instead because the ground was too hard			2
searchers , some with cadaver dogs , have looked on the sides of nearby roads and in a wooded area			0
police have also searched for the children 's bodies in @entity82 , about 33 miles north of @entity9 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity83			1
the investigation kicked off november 18 , when @entity37 told @entity85 , @entity86 , police that she needed protection from @entity12 , who she claimed was " holding ( her ) against my will			2
" according to the domestic violence petition , signed @entity94 , she said , " i feel he may have murdered his children , because he said they were non-responsive			0
he would not let me check on them			0
" she said @entity36 had told her " choices were made ... and he had to do what he had to do			0
" @entity37 herself was arrested last tuesday , charged with two counts of willful abuse and neglect of a child			0
three days later , @entity107 -- who for two days had been hosting his long - time friend , @entity36 -- called @entity109 , @entity110 , police after hearing news reports about the children 's disappearance , according to a report from the county sheriff 's department			1
when @entity107 asked @entity12 about it , the children 's father yelled , " i did n't do it " and left the home , the report said			1
police eventually tracked down @entity36 , who again asserted his innocence before his arrest friday			0
he faces two counts of aggravated child abuse and two counts of abuse of a corpse -- the latter because , @entity8 said , of his " disposing of the bodies in the woods			0
" on monday , @entity134 district court judge @entity133 set bail for @entity12 at $ 206,000 -- $ 100,000 each for the child abuse charges , and $ 3,000 apiece for the corpse abuse counts -- reported @entity0 affiliate @entity138			0
prosecutors had asked for no bail , given the severity of the crime and saying @entity12 was a flight risk given that he stayed in homeless shelters to avoid being caught			0
@entity36 and @entity37 had one infant daughter together , according to @entity37 's account in the @entity86 police report			1
police said one reason @entity37 claimed she needed protection from @entity12 was that she feared for the safety of the infant , who was with @entity37 in @entity86			0
@entity8 said the two slain children 's biological mother lives in @entity9 , but she did not have custody " because , at the time , she did n't have a place to live			1
" people in and around @entity9 , meanwhile , are mourning the loss of the two youngsters			2
" we 're just heartbroken , " said @entity163 , a family friend			0
we want to see their little faces ... we wanted them back around @entity168			0
" @entity0 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
