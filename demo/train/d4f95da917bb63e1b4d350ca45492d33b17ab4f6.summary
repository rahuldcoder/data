-- an @entity2 jury on monday began the sentencing phase for convicted serial killer @entity4 , ultimately deciding whether he should receive life in prison or the death penalty for killing 11 @entity9 - area women between 2007 and 2009			1
jurors on july 22 convicted @entity4 of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges , including abusing corpses and kidnapping			1
the sole not - guilty verdict came on an aggravated robbery charge			0
on monday , they heard from prosecutors asking for the death penalty and from defense attorneys trying to save @entity4 's life			1
" we believe that , at the end of the day ... at the end of all the evidence , that you will decide that death is not the appropriate penalty in this particular case , " said @entity23 , who is representing @entity4			1
during the sentencing phase , the defense could call up to 28 witnesses -- among them family members , acquaintances and five expert witnesses -- according to @entity40 court administrator @entity39			1

the prosecution expects to call two or three witnesses of its own , during the rebuttal phase , @entity39 said			0
@entity4 will be able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination from prosecutors , said @entity49 , a spokesman for the @entity40 prosecutor 's office			2
@entity4 has been classified as a " sexually violent predator , " meaning parole is not an option , @entity49 said			1
if jurors decide to recommend that @entity4 die for his crimes , the judge can overrule that recommendation and impose a life sentence			1
but if jurors decide to spare @entity4 's life , the judge can not impose a death sentence , @entity39 said			1
@entity4 's convictions ended a saga that began in october 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims ' remains inside @entity4 's home			1
he eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52			1
he grew up in @entity71 , joined the @entity72 at age 18 and traveled to @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , authorities said			0

" he was known locally for selling scrap metal			0
@entity4 's inconspicuous two - story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as @entity85			1
at one point , one in five homes there was in foreclosure and at least a third of the residents received food stamps , according to a 2010 study by @entity96 's @entity95 and @entity97			0
a stench hovered around the area , but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh , instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory			0
many of @entity4 's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point , and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits			2
the disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years , with only four women being reported missing			0
in late 2008 , a woman named @entity118 told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer , and when she declined he punched her in the face several times			0
@entity124 said he then tried to rape her , dragging her toward his home , and that she escaped after " gouging his face			0
" police investigated @entity124 's complaint , and one police report noted the presence of blood droplets on @entity4 's walls and steps			2
but officers told @entity0 affiliate @entity136 that the case was dropped after @entity124 declined to press charges			0
six more women disappeared after her complaint			0
the first bodies were discovered after a 36 - year - old @entity9 woman told police a story similar to @entity124 's			1
it was also similar to the story of the woman whose 1989 account led to @entity4 's attempted rape conviction			2
the @entity9 woman said he had invited her into his home for beer , punched her in the face and began performing oral sex on her -- letting her go only after she promised to return the next day			2
most of the women whose remains were found in and around @entity4 's home had been strangled by ligature , which can include a string , cord or wire , and at least one had been strangled by hand , officials said			1
seven women still had ligatures wrapped around their necks			0
a skull was all that remained of one victim ; it had been wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home 's basement			0
at @entity4 's trial , his defense rested without calling any witnesses or presenting any evidence , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity181			1
his defense attorneys have declined previous requests by @entity0 to explain their case .			0
