@entity7 airstrikes " are not going to save " the key @entity3 city of @entity4 from being overtaken by @entity5 , said @entity1 spokesman rear adm. @entity0			1
" i think we all should be steeling ourselves for that eventuality , " he told reporters in a daily briefing wednesday			0
" we are doing everything we can to halt " @entity5 ' progress against the town , but airstrikes alone can not stop the @entity17 militants , @entity0 added			1
" we 've been very honest about the limits of air power here			0
the ground forces that matter the most are indigenous ground forces , and we do n't have a willing , capable , effective partner on the ground inside @entity3 right now -- it 's just a fact , " he said			1
the greater @entity7 strategy , @entity0 said , is to degrade @entity5 ' ability to sustain itself			1
several senior @entity7 administration officials said @entity4 will soon fall to @entity5 , which calls itself the @entity27			1
they downplayed the importance of it , saying the city is not a major @entity7 concern			1
but a look at the city shows why it would mark an important strategic victory for the militants			0
@entity5 would control a complete swath of land between its self - declared capital of @entity39 , @entity3 , and @entity40 -- a stretch of more than 100 kilometers ( 62 miles )			1
as @entity52 put it , " if the @entity5 militants take control of @entity4 , they will have a huge strategic corridor along the @entity40 border , linking with the terrorist group 's positions in @entity49 to the west and @entity39 to the east			1
" @entity53 , @entity54 special envoy for @entity3 , warned of the horrors @entity5 could carry out against the people of @entity4 -- horrors it has carried out elsewhere			1
" the international community needs to defend them , " he said			0
" the international community can not sustain another city falling under @entity5			1
" the terrorist group claimed it had downed at @entity64 army helicopter in @entity65			1
photographs posted to an @entity5 website show smoke and fire around an aircraft , which is then seen completely charred on the ground			1
a truck bomb driven by @entity5 exploded near the center of @entity4			2
two civilians and a fighter inside the city described it as huge			0
the target was a security forces building , they said			0
however , @entity80 official @entity79 told @entity81 , the truck did not reach its intended target and detonated early			1
coalition batters @entity5 positions with airstrikes a @entity7 - led coalition has been pounding @entity5 positions in the region with airstrikes for a few weeks , conducting nine airstrikes in @entity3 and three in @entity64 on wednesday			1
in @entity3 , eight strikes near @entity4 destroyed five @entity5 armed vehicles , a supply depot , a command and control compound , a logistics compound , and eight occupied barracks , according to a statement from @entity99			1
" @entity99 continues to monitor the situation in @entity4 closely			0
indications are that @entity80 militia there continue to control most of the city and are holding out against @entity5 , " it read			2
overnight into thursday , the @entity106 @entity105 in the @entity107 attacked its first target in @entity64 : an @entity5 facility			1
a former head of the @entity111 doubted the wisdom of coalition airstrikes -- alone			2
" the rules of war are well - written on this , and well - established			0
i 've been saying it , others have been said it , " retired gen. @entity117 told @entity81 's @entity118			2
" wars are n't ever going to be won from the air alone			2
they 're a vital part of success , but do n't expect a guy in an airplane to be able to seize and hold terrain , " he said			0
at least 45 @entity5 fighters have been killed in the strikes , though the number may be much higher , according to the @entity135 - based @entity134 , which gets information from sources on the ground			1
the most recent strikes , late tuesday into wednesday , included nine in @entity3 , the @entity7 military said			1
six were in the @entity4 area and destroyed an @entity5 armored personnel carrier , four armed vehicles and two artillery pieces , @entity99 said			2
@entity7 and coalition forces also conducted five airstrikes against @entity5 in @entity64 , the military said			1
the primary goal of the aerial campaign is not to save @entity3 cities and towns , the @entity7 officials said			1
rather , the aim is to go after @entity5 ' senior leadership , oil refineries and other infrastructure that would curb the terror group 's ability to operate -- particularly in @entity64			1
saving @entity64 is a more strategic goal for several reasons , the officials said			1
first , the @entity7 has a relationship with the @entity64 government			1
by contrast , the @entity164 administration wants @entity3 president @entity166 to step down			2
another reason : the @entity7 has partners on the ground in @entity64 , including @entity64 forces and @entity80 fighters known as @entity172			1
according to a senior military official , @entity7 military advisers are now working with @entity64 troops at the brigade level , not just in the joint command centers in @entity178 and @entity179			1
the advisers are not in combat situations , but the move means they are less removed than before , said the source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity			0
" our strikes continue alongside our partners			0
it remains a difficult mission			0
as i 've indicated from the start , this is not something that is going to be solved overnight , " president @entity164 told reporters wednesday			0
" we 're confident that we will be able to continue to make progress in partnership with the @entity64 government , because ultimately it 's going to be important for them to be able to , with our help , secure their own country , and to find the kind of political accommodations that are necessary for long - term prosperity , " he said			1
local fighters apparently made some headway wednesday morning , when some @entity5 militants in @entity4 were pushed back to the city 's perimeter , @entity80 official @entity79 said			1
the battles have been bloody			0
more than 400 people have been killed in the fight for @entity4 since mid-september , the @entity134 said			0
the opposition group said it has documented the deaths of 219 isis jihadists , 163 members of the @entity80 militia and 20 civilians			0
@entity7 plan against @entity5 : @entity64 first , then @entity3 the @entity7 ' goal is to first beat back @entity5 in @entity64 , then eliminate some of its leadership and resources in @entity3 , the @entity7 administration officials said			1
if all goes as planned , by the time officials turn their attention to @entity3 , some of the @entity3 opposition will be trained well enough to tackle @entity5 in earnest			1
@entity229 has been making efforts to arm and train moderate @entity3 opposition forces who are locked in a fight against both isis and the @entity166 regime			2
training @entity3 rebels could take quite a long time			2
" it could take years , actually , " retired gen. @entity236 said last week			0
" expectations need to be managed			0
" the @entity7 also wants @entity40 to do more , the officials said			1
the administration is urging @entity40 to at least fire artillery at @entity5 targets across the border			2
but the @entity40 reluctance , the officials say , is wrapped up in the complex relationship with their own @entity247 and the idea that they do n't want to help any of the @entity247 in any way			2
@entity81 ireporter @entity250 sent photos , taken tuesday night in @entity253 , showing clashes between police and protesters in the predominately @entity80 neighborhood of @entity258			2
while outside the @entity261 building in @entity135 on wednesday , @entity80 activists protested for stronger action			0
" we want more airstrikes			0
we want a clear message			0
there is a humanity that 's threatened and the massacre is about to happen , and we have to act very immediately and prompt , and intensify our attacks on them , " said @entity265 , a protester , and member of the @entity268 ( @entity268 ) in @entity3			2
hundreds of strikes , millions of dollars the @entity7 and its allies have made at least 271 airstrikes in @entity64 and 116 in @entity3			1
the cost ? more than $ 62 million for just the munitions alone			0
the effect ? @entity281 , some say , particularly in @entity64			2
one by one , the cities have fallen to @entity5 like dominoes : hit , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287			1
and standing on the western outskirts of @entity179 , @entity5 is now within sight			2
" that 's @entity292 right over there , " said @entity290			0
gen. @entity293 , using the @entity295 acronym for @entity5			2
the militants ' proximity to the capital is cause for concern			0
if the terror group manages to infiltrate and launch attacks in @entity179 or its green zone , the results could be disastrous			0
@entity293 said @entity5 has not been able to move from eastern @entity305 province to @entity179			0
but another brigadier general said that 's not even the biggest threat			0
the real danger to the @entity64 capital , @entity290			0
gen. @entity311 said , is from @entity5 sympathizers in the city			0
" they are a gang , " he said			0
" they deploy among civilians			0
they disappear into the civilian population and camouflage themselves			0

a @entity7 - led coalition conducts nine airstrikes in @entity3 ; three in @entity64
@entity5 claims to down an @entity64 military helicopter
air campaign alone wo n't defeat @entity5 , former @entity327 official tells @entity81
@entity7 officials : @entity332 goal is to go after leadership and infrastructure , not save cities
