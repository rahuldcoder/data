-- does anyone know how to say " did that really just happen ? " in @entity3 ? who can predict how the women 's figure skating will turn out ? who just won his record - setting 13th medal ? it 's in the nyet what a strange day if you are a @entity3 @entity12 fan			1
the hockey team got knocked out ; amazing figure skater @entity14 tumbled during her short program ; and you saw a home - nation gold medal from a foreign - grown snowboarder			1
the country is in shock over the hockey team 's 3 - 1 loss to @entity24			1
remember the @entity3 ( or @entity25 ) used to own the gold medal , but they have n't won one in 12 years			1
more than one hour after the loss , a @entity29 bear mascot sat in the empty hockey arena stands , head in paw			1
the media ganged up on @entity3 coach @entity35 at the news conference			1
@entity37 of the @entity38 of @entity39 , @entity40 , said two of the best early questions were " how guilty are you feeling ? " and " is it a catastrophe ? " " i take full responsibility for our team 's performance , " the coach said , according to a translator			1
it 's hard to say the @entity52 have been ruined for a country that has won a second - best 22 medals , buuuuuuuuuut ... at least in the case of @entity14 , she did n't fall out of medal contention			1
she has the ability to lift the nation 's spirits if she can perform magnificently in thursday 's free program and get a bronze or silver			1
gold seems out of reach , but it is up to the judges			1
and there 's probably a little bit of pride in the husband - and - wife combination of @entity72 and @entity73			1
they competed 15 minutes apart in the parallel giant slalom with @entity76 , who became a @entity3 citizen two years ago , winning gold			1
his wife won bronze in the women 's event			1
" it was incredible to win with @entity73			1
we are together all the time			1
if one of us has success and the other does n't it 's great but it 's not that great , but for both of us to have success on the same day is a dream come true			1
maybe i will wake up soon , " he said			1
within reach @entity97 's @entity96 has a lot to think about			1
this is her last @entity12			2
she has skated only a few times in competition since winning a gold medal in @entity103 , leading to constant questions about her trying to repeat as champion			1
she 's also trying to inspire young figure skaters in the country that will host the next @entity12			2
and now she 's less than a point ahead of two other skaters after the short program in women 's figure skating			2
@entity115 of @entity3 and @entity116 of @entity117 are second and third , respectively			2
@entity96 , who has only skated in four international events since winning in 2010 , is retiring after these games			2
she will skate last on thursday			2
it 's not a position she likes			2
" but i have had this experience before			2
it wo n't be a big problem , " she said			2
@entity127 skaters @entity125 , who is six points behind and fourth , and @entity129 have outside chances at medals			2
" tonight was definitely nerve - racking , i 'll be honest about that			2
but i 'm set up well for the long program , " said @entity129 , who is in sixth and trails by nine points			2
hot diggity , @entity137 ! they call @entity137 " mr. @entity139			1
" it should be amended to " mr. @entity139			1
" the overwhelming favorite in the men 's giant slalom gave the opposition no chance at winning wednesday with a sizzling first run and a steady , self - assured second run that had the crowd congratulating him before he even reached the finish			0
" this is really awesome			0
this is the event i wanted the most			0
this is the event i have been putting so much pressure on myself to win , so to pull through is an awesome feeling , " he said			0
@entity137 became the first @entity127 man to win the event and joined @entity160 as the only two @entity127 skiers with two golds in alpine skiing			0
the 29 - year - old led by almost a full second after the first run , but was n't totally comfortable with such a huge margin			0
" if you blow out taking too much risk , you look stupid			0
if you go too easy and blow your lead , you look even more stupid			0
we would say you looked stupendous instead			0
hope you ski as well in the slalom			0
hope you mess up -- but not much @entity175 and @entity176 are friends			0
@entity178 even invited her @entity180 rival to her wedding in april			0
but as @entity175 stood with her teammate @entity182 at the bottom of the bobsled track wednesday , waiting for @entity178 to make her final run , she did hope for her pal to have a bobble here or hit there			0
" i never wish bad on people , but i was thinking , ' just make a few mistakes , please , ' " she told reporters			0
and in a sport where it takes four runs to crown an @entity200 champion , it was a tenth of a second that came between the winning @entity202 and @entity178			0
it was a hit at the top that @entity178 blamed for the loss			0
" i know i 'm going to get crap , and people will say it 's a disappointment , but i 'm not disappointed , " said @entity178 , who along with teammate @entity206 led after three runs			0
" i could n't be prouder			0
i 'm glad for silver , i did n't deserve the gold medal today			1
" @entity206 became the fifth olympian to medal in the @entity215 and @entity12			0
" this has been the most exciting experience of my life , " she said of her recent immersion into the sport			0
" i am so happy to have fallen into bobsled			0
who would have thought six months ago i would be bobsledding , let alone on the podium at the @entity12 ? " eight golds , four silvers , one bronze he won his first medal in 1998 in the biathlon sprint			1
four olympics later he is still adding to what is now a record - setting personal medal table			0
@entity233 won his 13th @entity200 medal wednesday , putting him alone atop the all - time individual medal table for the @entity12			0
his eight gold medals are also a record			1
he raced the third leg in the new mixed relay competition and put @entity240 far ahead , where it stayed , beating the @entity241 by 32 seconds			1
" i 'm really grateful for this victory , " he said , in typical understated fashion			0
" i 'm happy for my team			0
" is there one more podium in the bag ? the men 's relay is saturday .			0

husband : how was your day ? wife : great , i got a bronze . you ? husband : a gold
