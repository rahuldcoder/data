@entity0 -- work on the world 's largest solar bridge has started in central @entity0			1
the new solar roof spanning @entity6 above the @entity7 will cover more than 6,000 square meters when finished , according to developers			1
over 4,400 individual photovoltaic panels are expected to produce around 900,000 kilowatt hours of electricity every year , providing the station with half of its energy needs , according to @entity14 , the @entity15 company installing the solar roof			1
annual co2 emissions are also expected to be reduced by more than 500 tons			0
" it 's fantastic to see this project finally come to fruition			0
@entity22 is an ideal location for solar , " @entity20 , chief executive of @entity14 , said in a statement			0
" for people to see that solar power is working is a vital step towards a clean energy future , " he added			0
built in 1886 , the railway bridge is being transformed as part of an upgrade by @entity32 -- the owner and operator of rail infrastructure in the @entity15 -- to the existing @entity6 station			2
" the @entity38 rail bridge at @entity6 is part of our railway history			2
constructed in the age of steam , we 're bringing it bang up to date with 21st century solar technology to create an iconic station for the city , " @entity42 , @entity32 's project director for @entity6 said in a statement			1
in addition to the solar panels ( manufactured by the @entity53 ) , the station will also include rain - harvesting systems and sun pipes for natural lighting			0
the solar roof and the new station are due to be completed by the summer of 2012 .			2

new solar array will be largest on a bridge anywhere in the world , say developers
@entity6 in central @entity0 will carry 4,400 photovoltaic solar cells on roof
@entity69 panels will create 900,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year , *generating* 50 *%* of new station 's power
new station due for completion in 2012
