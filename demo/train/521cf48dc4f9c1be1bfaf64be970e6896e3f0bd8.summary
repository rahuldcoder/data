-- this year has provided something of a bumper crop of @entity4 candidates			1
@entity5 and @entity6 in the @entity8 primaries , @entity9 and @entity10 in the general election			1
given the endless cycle of sin and guilt that we have to live with , sometimes it feels like it 's easier for a @entity4 to get elected president than it is to get into heaven			1
but political strength does n't necessarily mean political unity			0
today 's @entity4 vote is divided by intensity of faith			1
according to @entity26 , the " very religious " lean toward @entity27 and the " nonreligious " prefer @entity28 , by significant margins			0
this reflects an internal story of conflict between liberal and conservative perspectives on what it means to be a @entity4			1
@entity9 and @entity10 stand on either side of that debate , and their selections as running mates signal vastly different approaches to winning the @entity4 vote			1
@entity9 is part of the @entity47 generation of @entity48 , reared on the lofty ambitions of the 1960s			1
after the @entity47 council , the church reformed its liturgy to encourage greater participation of the laity and make the @entity56 more accessible			0
for many @entity48 , evangelization and catechism became less important than charity and social activism			0
some , like @entity9 , have even accepted homosexuality and abortion as part of society 's slow evolution toward justice for all			1
" the animating principle of my faith , " he said in 2008 , " as taught to me by church and home , was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power			0
" this commitment to egalitarian democracy could even make him a critic of the hierarchy of the @entity48			0
although he carries his rosary everywhere and attends @entity56 on sunday , @entity9 struggles with the concept of obedience			1
" there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church , you are at odds with the church , " he told an interviewer			0
" i think the church is bigger than that			0
" on the campaign trail , @entity9 's @entity94 expresses itself in public attendance at ethnic @entity4 events like the @entity99 parade in @entity100			1
but he also recently took time out to eat ice cream with the nuns of @entity103			0
some interpreted this as a private " thank you " for the support many sisters have shown for @entity109 , contradicting the public position of their bishops			0
it 's also notable that @entity9 's @entity94 was invoked by many commentators after his embrace of same - sex marriage , as if he spoke for a generation of @entity48 who have come to terms with social change			1
when it comes to the culture war , @entity9 enjoys a certain amount of soft power			1
belief : @entity10 will provoke a debate on @entity4 politics by contrast , @entity10 's engagement with the @entity4 power is all hard power			1
his rhetoric is steeped in conservative historicism and theology			0
he explained his legislative philosophy to @entity135 this way , " as a congressman and @entity4 layman , i really feel that catholic social truths are in accord with the ' self - evident truths ' our founders bequeathed to us at our nation 's founding : independence , limited government and the dignity and freedom of every human person			1
" @entity151 , his budget proposals are n't just good bookkeeping , he says			0
they are both @entity155 and @entity156			0
when @entity10 was growing up , the charismatic , anti-communist @entity157 was @entity159			1
his traditionalist ethos has been continued and expanded under @entity161 , who has talked seriously of the church becoming smaller but purer			0
in this context , @entity163 and @entity94 find synergy -- and @entity10 is its embodiment			1
he has a large family , boasts a 100 % percent prolife voting record , and supported the constitutional ban on same - sex marriage			2
@entity10 also is happy to lend his catholic moral theology credentials to his new boss , who sometimes struggles to strike a chord with religious voters			2
belief : @entity8 's @entity176 ticket changes meaning of ' values ' during his @entity180 speech accepting @entity27 's nod , @entity10 got big applause for his promise to help " save the @entity155 dream			2
" but he got much bigger applause for this statement : " our rights come from nature and @entity191 , not government			0
" it 's a neat appropriation of the @entity4 belief that dignity is a gift from @entity191 , for the sake of rallying conservatives of all backgrounds			2
for those who like their state small , it suggests contempt for the civil rights - guaranteeing federal leviathan			0
for those who want it just large enough to outlaw same - sex marriage and abortion , it promises a @entity156 approach to governance			0
whereas @entity9 meets privately with nuns and emphasizes a private faithfulness , @entity10 puts his @entity94 right out in the open -- and he attracts some evangelical support for doing it			1
does any of this matter ? in a tight election , perhaps			0
in 2004 , @entity217 made a big play for churchgoing @entity48 , hitting themes of sexual and social conservatism			2
the result was that a ) the @entity4 vote was just as important in deciding the election as the evangelical vote and b ) catholic voting split along lines of church attendance			2
overall , @entity217 won the @entity4 vote 52 % to 47 % , a vital factor in a relatively close election			2
so @entity9 and @entity10 present opportunities and challenges for their tickets			1
@entity9 will appeal to those @entity48 ( some say , a silent majority ) who define themselves as faithful but who are also tolerant of cultural difference			2
but precisely because his appeal is n't strictly religious , it may fail to stir excitement on the campaign trail			0
for @entity10 , the visibility of his faith wo n't be a problem			1
but he will have to find a way of expanding its appeal beyond social conservatives			0
as former @entity217 strategist @entity249 writes , he still has to find a way of reconciling his fiscal conservatism to @entity94 's empathy for the powerless and poor			1
if he sticks to purely moral themes , while also pushing for budget cuts , his brand of @entity4 fervor may come across as all fire and brimstone and no heart			2
in an age of recession , that may not generate the votes that he and @entity27 need to win			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			2

@entity266 : the *vp* candidates reflect divide between liberal and conservative @entity94
he says @entity9 is a @entity4 aimed at social justice and accessible faith
he says @entity10 hews to traditional @entity94 ; record is *anti-abortion* , anti-gay marriage
@entity266 : @entity10 will have to show social *compassion* with fiscal conservatism
