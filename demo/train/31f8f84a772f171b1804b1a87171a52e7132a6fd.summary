-- a triumphant @entity1 called sunday 's @entity3 @entity2 the best race of 2012 but for many it was more important than that -- it was @entity6 being reborn in the @entity3			1
since the sport abandoned the @entity3 in 2007 it has been a long road back -- but a journey @entity6 desperately needed to make as a global sport , especially with the bizarre 2005 race still fresh in some minds			1
yet its first job of finding a new home was fraught with frustration			0
after the @entity16 lost its contract to host @entity6 , the @entity19 city of @entity20 successfully bid to stage the race on a purpose - built track			1
but less than a year ago , the chances of a race being held at all looked like they had bitten the nearby desert dust			1
workers at the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) had downed tools and the deal with @entity6 supremo @entity30 was off			0
" it came pretty close to being canceled , " @entity31 , co-founder with sister @entity34 website , told @entity0			0
" there were high stake negotiations between @entity27 and mr @entity30 -- who was going to pay and how much			2
they 'd already spent $ 100m on excavation and infrastructure			0
nobody could believe they 'd let this go			0
" ' dirt and nothing ' on december 6 , @entity30 eventually re-signed a contract with the circuit , which had secured extra funding through @entity19 businessmen @entity49 and @entity51			0
after 21 days of torpor , a frantic period of construction began to get the circuit ready in time for the grand prix			0
" it was n't long ago that it was dirt and nothing out there , " recalled @entity56 , an @entity20 sous chef who lives on a 150 - acre property just 30 yards from the circuit 's hairy uphill first turn			1
" it was just pasture			0
it might have been used for cattle			0
then there was a lot of construction but it 's been pretty cool to watch it grow			2
" the circuit received an official seal of approval in september but 12 miles away , pockets of downtown @entity20 remained unsure about @entity6			1
walking around the city a fortnight ago , there was a general feeling that the laid back state capital -- which prides itself on its live music -- was blithely unaware of what was about to roll into town			0
" i 've said for a long time that this city had no idea what was coming , " agreed @entity81 , the @entity6 correspondent for the @entity83 newspaper			0
" there 's also a part of this town whose criticism of @entity6 is based on a misunderstanding of it -- there 's an element that does n't think it 's very cool			2
" despite those reservations , @entity20 embraced @entity6 over the gp weekend with @entity19 bonhomie , barbeques and what amounted to a 24 - hour festival of live music in downtown 's throbbing hub			1
" @entity20 is already on the map , we 're the live music capital of the world , " enthused @entity109 from @entity20 's @entity111 area			1
" now we 're going to be the @entity3 @entity2 capital of the world			1
" the fans aside , the @entity115 - designed circuit has also satiated the drivers ' demands for on - track thrills with its elevation changes and high - speed curves			1
" the change of direction is faster than @entity127 and that 's saying something , " opined @entity124 's @entity123 , the 2009 world champion			2
" on sunday , the course staged an intense and intoxicating race , the result of which deliciously sent the 2012 title decider to the final grand prix in @entity137			2
the event also saw 117,500 fans -- just 2,500 shy of the circuit capacity -- turn out for a gp on @entity3 soil , with many attending for the first time			1
" i 've never experienced a race in my entire life , " said @entity143 from @entity144 , @entity145			0
" it was absolutely amazing			0
" how fast the cars go is so mind - boggling			0
they just put on such a spectacular show			0
we had no problems , it 's been very unstressful			0
" marketing opportunity for the teams and sponsors , the lure of the @entity3 market has also set pulses racing -- a five - year absence from the world 's second largest car market has been agony for those who are anxious to promote their brands in difficult financial times			1
" we 're delighted that , after five years , @entity6 is back in the @entity3 , " said @entity171 vice-president @entity170			2
" this is very , very important			0
" it is the biggest market for our premium cars and our colleagues over here will use this event over a long period of time to support our sales initiatives			0
" there are even opportunities for teams with non-motoring products to market , such as @entity186 who sell most of their energy drinks in the @entity3 but while the city , the circuit , the racing and the shop window it provides have all trumpeted @entity6 's return to the @entity3 , it must still do more if it is to conquer @entity3			1
many @entity3 still consider the sport , which trails behind domestic series @entity196 and @entity198 in audience share , to be elitist			1
" it 's been an odd relationship with @entity6 , " said @entity198 icon @entity200 , who was in @entity20 to watch his cousin @entity201 drive for the @entity203 team			1
" there 's a core of hardcore @entity6 fans in @entity3 but the mainstays are @entity196 and @entity198			1
generally nobody worried about it and @entity6 did n't really worry about @entity3			2
it needed a facility like this to bring it all together			0
" like others in the @entity20 paddock , the @entity215 also believes @entity6 should do more to embrace its fans			2
" @entity198 is more accessible , our paddock is more open , you buy a ticket and you can all get in , " @entity200 added			0
" off the track , the public are used to having more access so they want that [ in @entity6 ]			0
" many feel an @entity3 driver and race team are also essential to build and sustain @entity6 's presence in the @entity3 the country has produced two world champions in @entity233 ( 1961 ) and @entity234 ( 1978 ) but @entity236 @entity235 was the last @entity3 to compete in @entity6 and it 's been five years since he lost his @entity239 seat to reigning title - holder @entity240			1
an approved entry for a new @entity3 - based marque , when the grid was expanded in 2010 , ended ignominiously with the collapse of the @entity246 because of a lack of funding			1
" @entity3 are very patriotic and they want someone to support , " said @entity249 , @entity250 's @entity3 - born reserve driver who is targeting a race seat in 2014			1
" in order to entice more fans , and to allow @entity6 to compete with @entity196 and @entity198 , there needs to be an @entity3 driver			1
" the future @entity170 added to the theory : " i would like to see a step - by - step approach : first , one successful event ; then a second one ; and ultimately an @entity3 driver			1
" hopefully we will also see an @entity3 team , like @entity264 in the past or like @entity266 's @entity265 , which won the @entity267 @entity2 in 1967 with the all - american car of the @entity269			1
" when asked how he might promote the @entity6 brand further in the @entity3 , @entity30 replied : " have maybe 10 races like we have in @entity272			2
" a new gp in @entity273 , which lost its place on the 2013 calendar because of money troubles , is penciled in for 2014			0
broadcaster @entity277 , who are the new @entity3 rights holders to @entity6 from 2013 , also plan to build a bigger audience by expanding coverage on its mainstream sports channel			2
" it 's not like in @entity272 where the mass population understands what the sport is , " argued @entity123 , who spends time training in @entity284 and @entity236			2
" i was running in @entity290 recently and a couple of people were like ' @entity123 ' and i thought ' wow , that 's amazing			0
we 'll get more people into the sport			0
" having it in @entity20 , a young , vibrant city should help attract a young audience but also get @entity3 more involved , actually wanting to work within the sport because that 's the real way @entity6 is going to grow in @entity3			1

sunday 's @entity2 in @entity20 ended the sport 's five - year absence from the @entity3
a near capacity crowd of 117,500 turned out to witness @entity1 win the race
hopes are high that an @entity3 driver can fuel the sport 's limited popularity in the @entity3
