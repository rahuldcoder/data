-- now that the @entity2 has invalidated part of @entity5 's voter registration law , states should be thinking twice before introducing laws to make it harder to cast a ballot			1
monday 's decision is indeed a big victory for voters — but it is also a stark reminder that free , fair and accessible elections in the @entity15 are not as guaranteed as you might think			1
to fix this , we need to modernize our election system			2
the @entity2 took a critical step toward this , confirming @entity22 ' broad authority to regulate how we conduct federal elections , particularly as politicians in states across the country continue to push new laws that would make it harder for @entity15 to vote			1
dozens of restrictive measures passed in 19 states before the 2012 election			2
citizens , the courts , and the @entity35 blocked or weakened most of them , but the push has continued in 2013			0
the court 's decision gives federal lawmakers an even stronger basis to provide minimum national standards for voting and bring our election system into the 21st century			1
the court also made it clear that states may not undermine @entity22 ' effort to streamline the voter registration process for federal elections			1
in 1993 , @entity22 passed the @entity50 , also known as the " motor voter " law , to upgrade registration			1
at the time , it was a terrific advancement for voters			2
it increased access to registration by providing one simple , uniform application form that could be used to register for federal elections in any state			0
it entitled all @entity15 to register to vote by mail and encouraged voter registration drives			1
it also gave citizens the opportunity to register while applying for a driver 's license and other government services ( hence the nickname )			0
this law has worked remarkably well			0
voter registration rates surged after its passage ; almost 16 million @entity15 register each year using its procedures			1
but in 2004 , @entity5 passed a law that contradicted motor voter			1
it required voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering			0
if voters submitted a federal registration without these documents , @entity5 rejected their applications			1
this prevented tens of thousands of citizens from registering , made it difficult for many to register by mail , and dramatically cut back on community - based drives			0
the court 's decision stops that from happening			0
it resoundingly affirms what @entity22 tried to do with motor voter : create minimum national standards and streamline the registration process			1
but we should n't stop there			0
two decades ago , computers were still new to public institutions			0
now they 're everywhere and in the palm of our hands			0
motor voter was the solution for the 20th century , but it has relied on error - prone paper forms and the mail			1
it is still ramshackle — illegible handwriting leads to mistyped names and addresses , for one thing -- and a chief cause of long lines and @entity114 chaos			0
this can jeopardize a person 's right to vote and harm the integrity of our elections			2
there are better solutions for the 21st century			0
we need to change the way we think about voter registration and move our system into the digital age			1
if citizens take the responsibility to register to vote , the government has the responsibility to ensure they can			0
existing technology can give citizens the choice to be electronically registered to vote at the same time they do business with a government office , such as when they apply for a driver 's license or state veterans ' benefits			2
we can also enable citizens to register online and stay registered if they move or change their address			0
this would add 50 million eligible @entity15 to the rolls , cost less and curb the potential for fraud			2
fortunately , we 've seen movement across the country			0
already , most states -- including several this year -- have implemented key reforms			0
@entity151 passed a broad modernization bill , and @entity153 and @entity154 instituted online registration			2
in january , rep. @entity156 , @entity157 , and sen. @entity158 , @entity160 - @entity159 , introduced the @entity161 , which includes modernization at its core			0
judging by the long lines last november , we clearly need national voting standards that make voting speedy and efficient			1
motor voter does that — and we are thankful the court agreed — but it 's not enough			1
to ensure our elections remain open to all eligible @entity15 , registration must be brought into the 21st century — now			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173			2

@entity173 : @entity2 's @entity5 ruling points up need for voting modernization in @entity15
@entity2 said @entity22 , not states , regulates vote . motor voter act aimed to make it easier , she says
she says registration must move to digital age , *replacing* paper system , admitting more voters
@entity173 : some states already do this . we need national voting standard for election process
