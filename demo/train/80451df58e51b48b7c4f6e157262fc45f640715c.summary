@entity0 , @entity1 -- if there 's anything in which @entity1 takes pride -- aside from a massive construction boom -- it is providing its @entity1 minority and the hundreds of thousands of expatriates working and living here with plenty of shopping opportunities			1
@entity12 booked " @entity14 " artist @entity13 , from @entity15 , to help draw more crowds in @entity0 you can nary drive a kilometer in @entity0 -- few @entity1 actually walk the streets -- without passing a shopping mall			1
and few of those malls are lacking hordes of people strolling from store to store			0
from the pricey jewel - adorned head scarf fashions to budget - conscious it - could - be - rat - leather shoes , food courts to suit @entity30 and @entity31 tastes , to perfume shops selling essences for more per ounce than many people earn in a month -- shoppers in @entity0 are spoiled for choice			2
i 'm lucky to have a few @entity1 national friends in @entity0			1
each time i visit , i 'm treated to a familiar , and always entertaining , routine ... passing time at a succession of shopping centers			1
yes , many of you may think this pastime -- especially in @entity47 -- is for the kiddies			0
and yes , my friends and i are in our 30s			0
but there 's a more sophisticated , @entity53 cultural aspect to " hanging out " at a @entity54 at @entity55 or drinking mint tea at one of the restaurants in the renovated @entity59			0
for many " shoppers " -- male and female -- these centers are an opportunity catch up with friends , and discretely flirt and mingle ... even if only by exchanging messages via @entity63 on the cellphone			1
and unlike many teenyboppers cruising the malls of @entity47 , most of the adults here are a shop owner 's dream : high - end , impulse purchasing consumers with a lot of money to spend -- and a lot of time to kill			2
little surprise then , that shopping mall developers and management have taken to providing more entertainment options to pull in the crowds : the obligatory movie theater , for example			1
one mall 's basement is host to a skating rink			2
at a recent stop at @entity96 , thumping hip - hop beats had kids dropping their @entity100 's ice cream cones and running to the center atrium to see what all the fuss was about			0
turns out there 's this athlete literally center stage of the mall , kicking and balancing a soccer ball -- ok , football -- about his head , shoulders , legs and back with such skill he might put @entity115 to shame -- and doing this to the beat of hip - hop african tunes for what seemed more than just a few minutes			2
@entity15 native @entity13 's " freestyle soccer " routine mesmerized the crowd			0
ironically , it distracted them from shopping -- but kept shoppers in the @entity12 longer and gave people something new to talk about			0
apparently his athletic tricks have landed him television and live performances in @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and , increasingly , in the @entity53 world			0
@entity138 would seem a long way to book an act to attract more shoppers			0
but then again , the stakes are high in an increasingly competitive shopping mall - packed @entity1			1
as long as the mall remains an outlet to spend petro - dollars -- and @entity0 's main , all - access social networking scene -- mall developers will have to step up their game to keep consumers happy			1

@entity2 's @entity154 hangs out at a shopping mall in @entity0 , @entity1
spending time in shopping malls is a *popular* pastime for local *residents*
mall managers hire entertainers to attract *customers* and their *dirhams*
