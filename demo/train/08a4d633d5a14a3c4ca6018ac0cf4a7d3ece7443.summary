@entity0 -- @entity2 dropped its claim monday for a $ 17.5 million insurance policy for @entity5 , just days after e-mails revealed the concert promoter had doubts about @entity5 's health at the time they were applying for the insurance			1
@entity2 lawyer @entity11 told @entity1 later monday the move has been in the works for months and is not connected with the controversy over the e-mails			1
a @entity16 underwriter sued @entity2 and @entity5 after @entity5 's death , claiming they failed to disclose information about the pop star 's health and drug use			1
" in exchange for @entity2 withdrawing its insurance claim , underwriters agreed to dismiss @entity2 from the case and to waive any costs recoverable from @entity2 , " said @entity22 , attorney for the insurance underwriter			0
" the insurance case continues against the @entity30 for , among other things , rescission of the policy due to nondisclosures of @entity5 's prior drug use			1
" source of leaked @entity5 e-mails identified the @entity5 estate , which controls @entity30 , is still pursuing the insurance payout , its lawyer said monday			1
@entity5 died of an overdose of a surgical anesthesia in combination with sedatives on june 25 , 2009 , according the the @entity47 coroner			1
dr. @entity48 was found guilty last year of involuntary manslaughter in @entity5 's death			1
a controversy over the insurance claim erupted last week after the @entity52 published e-mails which the insurance lawyer said had not been provided to him despite a year of discovery in the case			2
@entity2 , the president of @entity2 -- the concert - promotion branch of @entity2 -- called @entity5 's death " a terrible tragedy " in one e-mail written weeks after he died , adding " but life must go on			1
" " @entity2 will make a fortune from merch sales , ticket retention , the touring exhibition and the film / dvd , " @entity2 wrote			0
in fact , @entity2 was allowed to sell @entity5 tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary " @entity73 , " produced from rehearsal video			2
the e-mails suggest @entity2 's president saw @entity5 's problems first - hand the day the pop star was to appear at the @entity78 to publicly announce the shows			1
" @entity5 is locked in his room drunk and despondent , " @entity2 wrote in a march 5 , 2009 , e-mail to @entity2 's parent company , the paper reported			1
" i ( am ) trying to sober him up			0
" " i screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking , " @entity2 wrote			0
" he is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self - loathing and doubt now that it is show time			0
" the promoter blamed @entity92 traffic when @entity5 was 90 minutes late for the announcement that day			2
" he 's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever , " @entity2 told @entity1 two months later to refute reports @entity5 's health was threatening the concerts			1
the @entity52 story , however , said the e-mails indicated major doubts about @entity5 's ability to perform			1
" we can not be forced into stopping this , which @entity5 will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants , " @entity2 executive @entity102 e-mailed to @entity2			2
@entity5 's missed rehearsals in june triggered concerns in e-mails that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to lip - sync on stage , the newspaper reported			1
" @entity5 is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time , " one e-mail from the show 's music director read , the paper reported			1
a production manager wrote : " he was a basket case			0
" a loud warning from show director @entity126 , who worked closely with @entity5 on previous tours , came in mid-june , just over a week before his death			2
@entity126 wrote to @entity2 that @entity5 had " strong signs of paranoia , anxiety and obsessive - like behavior " and suggesting they bring a " top psychiatrist in to evaluate him asap			2
" previously on @entity1 : @entity5 family drama " it is like there are two people there			0
one ( deep inside ) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him , the other in this weakened and troubled state , " @entity126 wrote			0
" i believe we need professional guidance in this matter			0
" @entity126 testified at @entity48 's trial about his concerns about @entity5 's frail condition and missed rehearsals			1
it resulted in a meeting six days before @entity5 's death in which @entity48 assured the promoters he would have @entity5 ready for rehearsals that next week			1
an e-mail from @entity2 after that meeting said he had confidence in @entity48 " who i am gaining immense respect for as i get to deal with him more			0
" " this doctor is extremely successful ( we check everyone out ) and does not need this gig , so he ( is ) totally unbiased and ethical , " @entity2 ' e-mail said			0
a wrongful - death lawsuit , filed by @entity5 's mother and his three children , contends that @entity2 contributed to the pop star 's death by pressuring him to prepare even though the promoters knew he was in a weak condition and by its hiring and supervision of dr. @entity48			1
" @entity177 did not hire dr. @entity48 nor were they responsible for the death of @entity5 , " @entity2 lawyer @entity11 told @entity1 last week			1
@entity2 's lawyer accused @entity181 , the children and their lawyers of leaking the e-mails to a reporter , in violation of a court order , despite a claim of responsibility by someone else			1
@entity191 , who partnered with @entity181 on a book about her family , acknowledged to @entity1 last week that he gave the documents to @entity52 reporter @entity195			0
@entity191 was involved in a bitter copyright dispute concerning that book with @entity5 's estate at the time he gave the reporter the documents , but the lawsuit was settled last week			1
@entity191 said he obtained the documents from various sources , but none of them came from the @entity205 or their lawyers			0
some of the documents were part of discovery in other cases , including the criminal trial of @entity48 , he said			0
@entity2 lawyer @entity11 , who said tuesday that he had " unequivocal evidence " showing that @entity5 's mother and her lawyers leaked the e-mails , has asked the judge in the wrongful - death suit to punish @entity181 with fines and exclude the e-mails as evidence in the case			1
" the documents released to the press were given to @entity181 and her attorneys -- and to no one else -- confidentially in discovery and subject to a court order , " @entity11 said tuesday			0
on thursday , he called it " convenient that @entity191 -- a longtime business partner of the @entity229 -- has come forward in this fashion			0
" @entity2 served a subpoena on @entity191 , ordering him to testify under oath about the source of the e-mails , on friday , @entity11 said			0
" whether these documents were leaked through an intermediary or directly by @entity181 and her counsel , this remains an egregious violation of the court 's order requiring immediate sanctions and an investigation , " the @entity2 lawyer said			2
@entity11 accused @entity5 and her lawyers of leaking the documents -- despite that their " publication hurts her son 's memory and her grandchildren more than anyone else " -- because they " know they can not win on the law and are losing control over the case			0
" " after months of discovery , plaintiffs now know what we have known all along -- there is nothing to support their claims , " the @entity2 lawyer said			0
@entity5 lawyer @entity264 said the admission by @entity191 that he was the source of the e-mails should settle the matter			0
" he ( @entity191 ) definitely never received any documents from @entity181 , @entity271 , @entity272 , or @entity273 , nor from their lawyers in the wrongful death suit against @entity2 , " said @entity5 lawyer @entity264			2
@entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 are @entity5 's children			2
@entity264 criticized @entity2 's lawyers for their haste in pointing the finger at the @entity205			2
" @entity2 made these accusations against the @entity229 and their lawyers apparently without doing even the most rudimentary investigation , " @entity264 said			0
" we are further disturbed that the motion for sanctions filed by @entity2 was given to the press before it was served on @entity181 or her counsel			0
