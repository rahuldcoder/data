-- take two video - game console cameras and one pair of horn - rimmed glasses and for around $ 30 you have a device that will allow you to control a computer or , potentially , even a wheelchair with your eyes			1
previously , if you wanted to buy similar eye - tracking equipment it would have cost you upwards of $ 8,000			1
now , scientists in @entity12 have pioneered a device , the @entity14 , using components anyone of us can buy from the shopping mall			1
watch make create innovate on @entity20 the breakthrough could help millions of people suffering from @entity23 , @entity24 's , muscular dystrophy and , potentially , opens the door to a new era of hands - free computers , allowing us to use them without a mouse , keyboard or touch screen			1
for the lead researcher dr @entity35 , a neuroscientist at @entity36 in @entity12 , the new device only came about because of his obsession with disassembling gadgets			1
" i like to play with gadgets and was playing with a popular video - game console , " he said			2
" i hacked it and discovered it was very fast and better than any webcam for movement			0
actually , it was so fast that i found we could record eye movement with it			0
" tracking eye movement is no mean feat. our eyes moves 10 to 20 times a second , so a standard webcam or even film camera will miss most eye movements and where we are looking			2
as such , it is perhaps no surprise commercial eye - tracking devices are so expensive			2
watch a demonstration of the technology luckily for @entity35 and his team of researchers , video game console makers have been willing to bulk buy the technology needed to make good enough cameras			1
they make a loss on the console cameras in the expectation of making it back on accompanying video game sales			0
" we originally created the device for £ 39.80 ( $ 64 ) but recent falls in the price of video game console cameras mean we could now actually make the same device for about £ 20 ( $ 32 ) , " says @entity35			1
the eye - tracking device works by first establishing where the eyes are looking , through a relatively straight - forward calibration process			1
the user puts on the glasses , with the two attached cameras , and stares at a computer screen full of dots			2
they are then told to look at different dots , with software developed by the researchers working out how the eye looks at each dot			0
opinion : ' teach young people to be more innovative ' once calibrated , the device can be used to control a mouse on the screen and is so accurate that if you were in a normal - sized room and wearing the device it would be able to locate where you were looking to within the size of a grapefruit , say its developers			1
existing commercially available devices such as the @entity105 and the @entity106 also allow users to control a computer with their eye instead of a mouse			1
like the @entity14 , they use two cameras and say they can be used to surf the web , send emails and do anything a handheld mouse can do -- but they are priced between around $ 5,000 and $ 7,000			0
and if you search online , you will find many amateur attempts to create eye - tracking devices just like the @entity14			2
but @entity35 says the difference with his is that it has been properly tested and proven to work -- a demonstration of his device has been published in the peer - reviewed journal @entity124			1
unsurprisingly , the interest in his technology has been huge , he says			0
several companies have already approached him to develop and mass - produce the device			0
however , @entity35 says , none have so far embraced his ambition for making it available at a low cost to millions			1
instead , they all preferred to undercut existing eye - tracking devices by 10 %			0
" my mission is that we forge technology with neurological science to find ways to help millions of people with disabilities , such as loss of limbs or muscular disorders , use technology in a cheap way , " said @entity35			1
" we want to make sure people can buy the device for no more than £ 80 ( $ 125 )			0
" quiz : accidental inventions if no commercial partner comes forward within the next year or two , @entity35 says they will publish all the information about their device and software online and make it freely available for anyone to replicate			2
for many disability campaigners , such a device can not come soon enough			0
" those with extreme muscle - wastage in their arms often rely on carers to work on a computer , can not position themselves comfortably at a keyboard and quickly suffer fatigue from typing , " says dr @entity162 , director of research at the @entity165 - based @entity164 , who calls it a " potentially life - changing innovation			1
" " it also offers us an exciting glimpse of future possibilities -- optical control of hoists , beds , blinds , kitchen and entertainment equipment			0
the impact of recovering the independence to do such things for disabled people , their carers -- and for family life -- would be vast , ' she adds			0
@entity35 says it would already be possible to control a wheelchair with their device			1
the main obstacle is how to differentiate between where someone is looking at where they actually want to move to in the wheelchair			0
he says this has been overcome by his researchers through the use of a wink as a command trigger			0
" we use a wink rather than a blink because you never wink by accident , " explained @entity35			2
however , while he can see its popularity for disabled or elderly people , @entity35 remains uncertain about whether cheap eye - tracking devices are ready to take over from the mouse and touch - screen computers			1
" perhaps it will bring in a new era of hands - free computers			0
but there is a problem in that the computer industry is moving towards touch systems with the @entity225 , so i 'm not sure the mass - market is going to embrace eye - movement just yet			2
also , i am not sure it is ready for use with complicated applications like , for example , @entity231			0
