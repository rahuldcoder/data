@entity0 -- handwritten messages pinned to a makeshift memorial board outside a @entity0 hospital describe the fear and resignation felt by many ordinary @entity7 that @entity8 may not be with them much longer			1
" you are and will always be a true legend and grandfather to us all , " reads one note tied around the neck of a little white bear			0
another , placed with a bunch of proteas , the country 's national flower , says " @entity8 you have touched our lives and blessed us in more ways than one			2
" many of the messages appear to be written by children , in colored glue and pen , including one which features the hand prints of children still far too young to understand the indelible mark the former president has left on their country			0
the touching and very personal tributes started appearing on the wall on june 8 , the day @entity8 was admitted to hospital for a recurring lung infection			2
however , what was hoped to be a short stint has stretched into its 19th day , the longest period of hospitalization ever for a man known not for his physical strength but personal fortitude			0
headlines in local newspapers leave little doubt about the challenges @entity8 , or @entity8 as he 's known here , faces after a life of struggle at the age of 94			1
against a predominantly black front page , the @entity59 's lead headline reads : " @entity63 , " with the sub headline " @entity62 for @entity8			2
" on sunday , president @entity64 announced that @entity8 's condition had slipped from stable to critical , prompting a private meeting of his closest family members tuesday			1
it 's not known what they discussed but the meeting added further worry as onlookers waited for an update from the presidential office on @entity8 's condition			1
since his condition worsened on sunday , media crews from around the world have made their way to the street outside the @entity81 in @entity0			1
late tuesday , in an ominous sign , large numbers of police officers descended on the area , setting up road blocks at either end of the @entity89 street , where the hospital is located			0
pedestrians are being allowed to move back and forth across the barriers , as are cars , but most media crews remain parked for fear of losing their space in what 's fast becoming a very crowded street			0
a number of satellite trucks have been moved into position , beaming live broadcasts around the world -- further evidence , if any is needed , of @entity8 's influence beyond the borders of his homeland			1
in between reports , journalists struggle to stay warm ; it 's winter in @entity7 and while the sun warms the air throughout the day , at night temperatures fall below freezing			2
no one knows how long the wait will last			0
if the darkening mood is anything to go by , it may not be long until @entity7 is forced to confront the reality that some hoped would never come .			0
