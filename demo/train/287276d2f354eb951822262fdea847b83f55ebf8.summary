-- just when i was ready to scream if i had to sit through another found - footage chunk of @entity3 out of the " @entity4 " / " @entity6 " playbook , along comes " @entity7 " to make me a believer			1
despite a gimmicky premise , " @entity7 " fuels its action with characters you can laugh with , understand and even take to heart			1
major props to screenwriter @entity17 and director @entity18 for this mesmerizing mind - bender			0
" @entity7 " starts with high school senior @entity21 ( @entity20 , looking like a young @entity23 ) setting up a camera in his bedroom to catch his abusive father ( @entity26 ) punching him out while @entity21 's mother lies dying downstairs			2
@entity28 & @entity29 to make live return at @entity31 @entity21 , the shy loner , finds that chronicling his life with a camcorder is opening his world			0
that 's especially true when @entity21 , his cousin @entity39 ( @entity40 ) and school icon @entity36 ( @entity37 of " @entity38 " ) discover a hole in the ground containing something alien			1
whatever it is gifts them with powers that start slow with magic tricks , messing with girls and shifting cars in a parking lot			0
@entity52 : ' @entity53 ' @entity20 , @entity40 and @entity54 excel in their roles , especially when the powers extend to flying and screwing with things dangerous and brutally destructive			0
" @entity7 " is too thrilling ( on a cheapie $ 15 million budget , yet ) to ruin with spoilers			2
the ending is overkill , but the potent and provocative journey never stops springing surprises			1
