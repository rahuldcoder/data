when president @entity1 took to the podium for thursday 's news conference / cum - mea culpa on the disastrous @entity5 roll out , the commander - in - chief said repairing his damaged credibility was on him and no one else			1
@entity8 : for @entity1 , a bad turn or a tipping point ? the bloodletting was a near - acknowledgment that his presidency is at a tenuous point			1
the @entity1 administration 's mismanagement of his signature legislative achievement threatens to sink the rest of his second - term agenda			1
with more than three years left in office , @entity1 teeters on the brink of lame - duckedness			1
but the problem of a tortured second term is not unique to the 44th president			1
many before @entity1 triumphantly won reelection only to be sunk by a scandal , a debacle or a mistake			1
obamacare : now what ? 3 hurdles @entity5 fix must overcome for @entity33 , public weariness over wars in @entity36 and @entity37 and the debacle over the government 's response to @entity41 , made his second term seem longer than four years			2
@entity44 's affair with @entity45 and his impeachment by the @entity47 marked his second term			2
those are n't the only instances			2
@entity50 had the @entity51 ; @entity52 's final years in office were dominated by the war in @entity55 and @entity56 resigned over @entity57			0
related : most former presidents look better through history 's eyes such woes have become so commonplace that they are summed up with this moniker : the second - term curse			1
gone is the energized a-team when a president first takes office , political and other pros are lining up for jobs			2
the president can pick from the best and the brightest to make the wheels turn			2
" when you come into the @entity47 , that is the moment of great promise , " said @entity72 , presidential scholar and associate professor at the @entity75 's @entity74			0
but ultimately the demands of working for a president take their toll and attrition sets in			2
" people get worn out , " and leave , @entity72 said			0
" over time , there tends to be some deterioration in the quality of the team that you are able to put together			0
" @entity88 : how could @entity1 not have known ? @entity1 : @entity89 needs more than technical fixes @entity72 points to the @entity50 administration as an example			1
when @entity50 was inaugurated in 1981 , he brought with him three confidants who became " @entity94			0
" @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 effectively ran the @entity47 staff and it paid off with reelection and a historic 525 electoral votes in 1984			2
but then the team began to fray			0
@entity95 became treasury secretary and @entity96 , attorney general , while @entity97 left the @entity47 for lobbying			0
under new leadership , @entity105 of the @entity106 did not hit on all cylinders			0
the @entity51 , in which the @entity50 administration was fingered for selling arms to @entity110 and circumventing a congressional ban by using the proceeds to send arms and money to anti-communist rebels in @entity116 , became a huge scandal			0
" it was disaster at the @entity47 , " @entity72 said			0
" that is not a mistake you make typically in a first term			2
it is case where you are trying to juggle the staffing apparatus later on			0
" digging for dirt and sensing a lame duck to @entity129 , a presidential historian and expert on president @entity131 , the reason for second - term woes is a combination of leverage and time			1
" their leverage on lawmakers in the @entity138 and with the voters is just inevitably diminished , " @entity136 said , pointing out that once @entity138 begins to smell presidential weakness , they seize on it as a way to speed up the " lame duck " process			1
" the longer presidents are around and when people get to know you well , they begin to know where your soft spots are and they know what you are good and what you are n't good at , " @entity136 said			1
" people eventually begin to figure out how to get to the presidents			2
that is just a function of the number of years			0
" to @entity136 , this could already be happening with @entity1			1
@entity159 talks about ' vindication ' @entity5 enrollment numbers give @entity163 second wind @entity163 in @entity138 have been attacking @entity1 since his 2009 inaugural			1
and while @entity1 has won some legislative victories , those have been hard fought			1
the health care law he championed and got with only @entity168 support in @entity138 is off to a rocky start with the public , and @entity163 are sensing weakness			1
poll : approval of @entity5 drops and with that , @entity136 said , comes @entity163 dreams of a larger majority in the @entity47 , control of the @entity179 and a pathway to the presidency in 2016			2
" for the opposition party , the more bad stuff they can dig up , the better they make it for themselves in the next election , " @entity136 said			0
" so tearing down the incumbent is a good way to prepare the way for a change and the @entity193 public tends to keep people for a while but quickly push them out			0
" @entity44 's experience is a good example			0
while accusations of infidelity plagued @entity44 since his time as governor of @entity204 , it was n't until years into his presidency that an accusation of impropriety was able to stick and severely damage him politically			1
the chickens come home to roost when @entity1 ran for office in 2008 , he made a number of promises : immigration reform , healthcare , ending wars in @entity36 and @entity37 , dealing with climate change			1
during his first term , he addressed some of those -- ending the war in @entity36 and slowly drawing down the conflict in @entity37			2
his administration also won on @entity5			0
6 things presidents wish they had n't said but the implications of those promises were not felt right away , @entity72 said			1
@entity228 on @entity5 promise : ' it was not honest ' " you make policy decisions in the first term and because it usually takes a while for these things to mature and to ripen and to get enacted , you can easily be in your fifth year before the full consequences of your first term become apparent , " @entity72 said			0
" when you get to the second term , the days of reckoning appear			0
" @entity72 's point is that when @entity1 promised to reform the health care system , he and his advisers had to know there was going to be pain involved with executing the law			1
but as with most administrations , @entity72 said , the @entity47 also knew those problems were n't going to come about for years			1
" presidents will always make decisions either to defer judgment on something or will make hard decisions , recognizing the consequences wo n't come down on them until after reelection , " @entity72 said			1
" i think it is just a general pattern			0
" the history of two terms although two terms is now the law , it was once just a tradition started by @entity262			0
after serving two terms , @entity263 declined to run again			0
" while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene , patriotism does not forbid it , " @entity262 said , acknowledging he could have run again had he wanted to			0
he did n't and the tradition was formed and stood until @entity270 ran and won four times , dying soon into his final term as @entity273 was drawing to a close			2
after @entity270 , the 22nd amendment to the @entity276 set a two - term limit			1
@entity278 : ' i lost my insurance under @entity5 '			0

@entity1 news conference was a near - acknowledgment his presidency is at pivot point
problems during a second term are n't unique to the 44th president
historian points to staff changes as one cause for second - term drama
two - term presidents are also considered " lame ducks " by @entity138
