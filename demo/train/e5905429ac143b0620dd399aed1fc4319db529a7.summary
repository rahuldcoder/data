-- former world number one @entity1 scored the winning point in the @entity3 for the second competition in a row to help the @entity6 retain their trophy against an international team in @entity10 on sunday			1
woods claimed a comfortable four and three success over @entity14 @entity13 in their singles match to send the @entity6 past the required 17 1/2 points total needed for victory			1

golfing presidents : putting for politics the @entity6 side held a healthy four - point lead going into the 12 singles matches , and those were eventually split 6 - 6 to ensure a 19 - 15 win for the visiting side -- their seventh success in nine @entity3 events so far			1
woods told reporters : " we did n't get off to a good start early on			0
we needed to get our point so we went out there and played really well -- putting a lot of heat on @entity39 ( @entity13 )			1
" the success completed a dominant @entity6 display over the four days , as they won both foursomes , split a fourball and narrowly lost the second fourballs sessions			1
on sunday , @entity1 ' victory was complimented by wins for @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- with @entity50 the only player to finish unbeaten in his five matches			2
in response to critics who believe the @entity6 fail to bond together in golfing team events , @entity50 told the official @entity59 website : " this stuff about how we are n't close and how we ca n't come together as a group , it 's just not accurate			2
" we will win some of these events like the @entity3 and the @entity64 , and we 'll lose some			2
but whatever we do , we 'll always do it as a team			0
" he continued : " since i 've started playing in these , i 've always loved them			0
but so do all the guys			0
look at @entity1 and @entity70 ( @entity71 ) in his room			0
do they look like they do n't care about what we just accomplished ? "			0
