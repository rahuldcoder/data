-- president @entity1 is set to deliver the first @entity2 of his new term			1
on tuesday evening , he will step before a joint session of @entity5 and a nation in difficult times			0
unemployment rose in january to 7.9 %			0
there are signs of economic progress , but millions of @entity12 are struggling to find a job while others are desperate to keep the one they have			1
other kinds of economic challenges face many people			2
the @entity18 recently released a study showing the growing number of adults who are struggling to support grown children and their parents , the " @entity24 " as they are called			0
the economy is just the tip of the iceberg			0
the issue of immigration needs to be resolved soon			0
too many immigrants live in a state of constant uncertainty about their future , or that of their children			0
the tensions in this debate are heightened by the fact that state and local governments are struggling to find enough revenue to pay for crucial services such as education			0
the climate also remains in peril , as the wild weather patterns of the past year have shown			0
at the same time , @entity12 are still reeling from the deadly shooting incidents that have caused horrible bloodshed in movie theaters and schools and waiting to see what @entity51 does , or does not do , about guns			1
then there are the countless foreign policy challenges we face			0
the @entity2 address gives president @entity1 a prime opportunity to lay out what he intends to do in the year ahead to guide the nation through these difficult challenges			1
although there are limits to how much these speeches can change public opinion , especially in an age of partisan polarization where large segments of the electorate are hard to move , it still is a vital moment where he can help shape the agenda for the coming year and outline some key themes for public discussion			0
@entity74 : speech may do little to change @entity51 it may be tempting to list a series of measures @entity1 wants @entity5 to pass , but the president should use this speech to do something more than provide a laundry list , and the historical record offers some guidance about how			1
the speech can offer a vision			1
in 1941 , president @entity87 gave one of the most historic @entity2 addresses when he outlined the @entity89			1
he delivered his speech on the brink of @entity12 becoming involved in @entity92 with @entity93 and @entity94 in the middle of a major military crisis , @entity87 defined the four freedoms that he believed should be the foundation of the international system : the freedom of speech and expression , the freedom to worship @entity103 , the freedom from want and , finally , the freedom from fear			1
" that is no vision of a distant millennium			2
it is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation , " @entity87 said			1
" that kind of world is the very antithesis of the so - called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb			0
" the speech was inspirational and offered a moral blueprint for the @entity12 , both in its efforts at home and abroad for decades to come			1
if president @entity1 wants to sketch a set of legislative goals , he might look to president @entity130			1
in 1965 , @entity130 was fresh off his landslide victory against @entity133 sen. @entity132 and he managed to outline a breathtaking agenda , offering proposals for government to expand its role in all walks of life , from education to health care to the environment			2
this was all part of the @entity146 , a vision that @entity130 had outlined a few months earlier at the @entity147 but which came to life during the @entity2 address			1
" @entity146 asks not how much , " @entity130 said , " but how good ; not only how to create wealth but how to use it ; not only how fast we are going , but where we are headed			2
" sometimes the @entity2 address can be an opportunity for a president to take a risk , to set out an objective for the nation that might be controversial or might look impossible at the time , but which challenges @entity5 and the citizens to repair broken parts of society			1
in 1862 , president @entity160 , with @entity12 in the @entity161 , insisted that the freedom of the slave was essential to the restoration of the union			1
" we — even we here — hold the power , and bear the responsibility			0
in giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free — honorable alike in what we give , and what we preserve			0
" the speech can also be a moment for honesty			2
one speech that often receives attention in top 10 lists is president @entity179 's @entity2 in 1975			1
@entity180 is an unlikely candidate for any historic list , as he took over from @entity183 after his resignation and would n't be re-elected in 1976			0
@entity179 governed in difficult economic times -- the nation was hit by the twin shock of inflation and unemployment , which came to be known as stagflation			0
when @entity180 went on the air , he was brutally honest			0
the state of the nation , he said , " is not good			0
" @entity180 proceeded to outline what @entity12 were facing			2
" millions of @entity12 are out of work			2
recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more			0
prices are too high , and sales are too slow			0
" while presidents usually like to use these speeches to make @entity12 feel good about where they are , president @entity1 might think about speaking straight to a nation frustrated with a new normal of stagnant growth , where politicians talk about economic improvement even as the workforce continually struggles with high rates of unemployment and economic insecurity			1
while @entity12 want a leader who can point a path forward , they also want to know that the person in the @entity215 truly understands the pain many are suffering			2
in his first @entity2 address , delivered in january 2010 , president @entity1 stressed his promise to help the middle class and to fix the broken political process in @entity51			1
" we face a deficit of trust , " he said			0
in his second address , delivered after the @entity225 had taken over the @entity215 and in the wake of the horrific shooting of rep. @entity228 , president @entity1 again appealed to the desire for unity			1
he also called on @entity5 to support a legislative package that would allow the @entity12 to regain its competitive edge			2
in january 2012 , @entity1 , highlighted the differences between the parties — the choice @entity12 would face in the upcoming election -- by calling on @entity5 to support investments in education , infrastructure and clean energy			1
he warned that growing economic inequality threatened the future of the middle class			0
" we can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well , " he said , " while a growing number of @entity12 barely get by or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot , everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules			2
" this time around , the president should think big , not necessarily about how much he wants to propose , but about the vision and ideas he wants to put forth to move the @entity12 forward			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity262			2

@entity262 : @entity1 delivers first @entity2 of second term
he says it 's an opportunity for president to sketch a broad vision for @entity12
speech comes at a time of continuing economic troubles in @entity12 , he says
@entity262 : @entity1 can follow in the footsteps of @entity87 and @entity130
