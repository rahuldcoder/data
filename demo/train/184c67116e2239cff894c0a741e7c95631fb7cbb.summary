-- to start with , @entity1 was hungry			2
he was 22 , the spring days were growing longer and the temperature in @entity4 had climbed to 80 degrees that tuesday in april 2012			2
it was not much cooler as the sun slipped behind the @entity8 mountains , so shortly before 8 pm , @entity1 drove with his pregnant @entity9 © toward a suburban intersection crowded with fast - food restaurants , a @entity12 , a @entity13 , drug stores and gas stations			1
not far off , another man was headed the same way			2
@entity18 was 29 , older than @entity1 , but mentally disabled			2
his family described him as more like a 12 - or 13 - year - old			1
@entity21 was walking his yellow labrador retriever named lady past a @entity24 in the gathering evening , when he stepped around a blind corner and was nearly hit by @entity1 's vehicle			2
police say the two men exchanged angry words , the dispute rapidly escalated , and it ended when @entity1 pulled out a .40 - caliber pistol and shot @entity21 dead			1
@entity1 , who was still in his car at the time of the shooting , told police it was self - defense , that @entity21 had lunged at him with a bat of some kind			1
but investigators found no such weapon , and even if they had county attorney @entity43 says , " the threshold that people believe needs to be crossed when they brandish a weapon , never mind actually use it ... is a lot higher than what it actually is			2
" @entity1 is now charged with murder in that killing last year , and because he is black and @entity21 was not , the case is drawing comparisons to the killing of @entity57 by @entity58			1
why the comparison ? if @entity1 is convicted , some would argue there 's racism in the justice system			0
in the @entity66 case , a black teen is killed and an @entity68 shooter is acquitted			1
in the other , a black man who claims self - defense faces prison time			1
unstable ground : the fine line between self - defense and murder the key questions being asked by many : if @entity58 was acquitted because he felt threatened , should n't @entity1 also walk ? and if he does n't , will his race and that of the victim have played a role ? the nation has a long history of self - defense laws			1
almost every state allows some version of the " castle " defense , as in " a man 's home is his castle			1
" these laws generally allow people to defend themselves , their family and their property against anyone who intrudes upon their living space , with deadly force if necessary			0
@entity0 legal analyst @entity99 says , " if you walk into my house uninvited , odds are you are n't going to be walking out			0
and most people support that			0
you 're going to protect your home and your family , and there 's very little argument about that			0
" it gets trickier when we start talking about so - called " stand your ground " laws which exist in more than 20 states			1
those laws extend the castle principle so that if you are legally in some place -- a parking lot , a mall , a football stadium -- it becomes like your home			0
accordingly , if someone attempts to attack you there , once again you are free to fight back and are under no compunction to attempt to avoid the conflict			0
@entity127 attorney general @entity126 finds such laws troubling , saying they " senselessly expand the concept of self - defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods			1
these laws try to fix something that was never broken			0
" but if self - defense laws have never been broken , many legal analysts have long noted that they can certainly be bent			1
rob a bank , steal a car , set fire to a house and authorities usually do n't much care how you feel about the crime			0
but self - defense cases are all about feelings			1
why did the person feel afraid ? was that fear justified ? was the response warranted ? @entity99 says that is where the slope gets slippery			0
" the standard is generally what a reasonable person would do under the circumstances and do you reasonably fear death or bodily injury ? that 's a very subjective standard			2
it 's not an objective standard			0
we 're all human beings			0
everyone is going to perceive something differently			0
" the @entity58 case illustrates his point perfectly			1
many @entity170 - @entity127 trial watchers had no trouble seeing @entity58 -- trailing after @entity57 with his cell phone on a rainy night -- as the aggressor			1
that interpretation makes sense if you frame it with a long history of black people feeling unfairly targeted by police , security guards and others			0
as president @entity188 put it friday , " i do n't want to exaggerate this , but those sets of experiences inform how the @entity170 - @entity127 community interprets what happened one night in @entity66			2
" many whites , however , have enjoyed a different relationship with the police and saw @entity57 as an architect of his own violent end			0
they asked : why did n't he call the police if he felt threatened ? why did n't he ask @entity58 if something was wrong and explain where he was going ? everyone who watched the trial saw the same facts and heard the same witnesses , but like characters in the old @entity205 film " @entity204 " they came away with different stories			1
grappling with such vagaries is the challenge in a great many self - defense cases			1
to be sure , sometimes cases in which people are purportedly protecting themselves or their property are easy to sort out			0
protesters stand up to ' stand your ground , ' but laws likely here to stay just this past week in @entity219 , 76 - year - old @entity218 , who is white , faced charges that he killed a 13 - year - old neighbor who was black			2
@entity218 accused @entity222 of burglarizing his home , and two days later accosted the young man as he retrieved his family 's trash cans from the curb			0
on a surveillance tape , @entity218 is seen emerging from his house with a pistol in hand , waving the weapon at @entity222 , and ultimately shooting him at a distance of five or six feet			2
the boy , who offered no visible signs of resistance during the entire confrontation , died on the street in his mother 's arms			0
@entity218 's lawyers argued that their client suffers from mental illness , saying " he did n't appreciate the wrongfulness of what he was doing " as he railed about his property			0
the court did not buy it , and @entity218 was convicted			0
but so many other matters of self or property defense involve difficult , complicated questions			1
was the defendant previously assaulted and thereby living in a state of heightened alarm ? was he or she a naturally excitable or nervous type ? did something else happen near the same time or in close proximity to the final incident that might have spurred an excessive reaction ? " we have to defend ourselves if someone is truly coming after us , " @entity99 says			0
" the last thing anyone wants to do is put themselves , their home or their family at risk			0
on the other hand , we need to make it so that we do n't have a trigger - happy society			1
" all of that means in the end , as much as people may want to find a perfect parallel to the @entity58 case ; a " gotcha " verdict from some other place in which a black man is convicted for doing just what @entity58 did , it is unlikely			1
because self - defense cases that look alike from a distance on a dark evening , may be substantially different when the details and defendants are dragged into the light of day .			1

@entity291 fatal shooting raises questions of self - defense
it has drawn parallels to @entity58 case
but varying circumstances can make comparisons difficult
