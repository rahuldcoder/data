if a teen carrying nothing but a comb can do it , who else could breach airport security and hop aboard the bottom of a plane ? that 's the question many are asking after a 15 - year - old boy sneaked into the wheel well of a @entity11 767 and flew from @entity12 , @entity13 , to @entity14 , @entity15			1
the city of @entity12 , which owns and operates @entity17 , is not planning to pursue criminal charges against the teen , said @entity19 , a city public information manager			1
immediately after the incident became known , many pointed the finger at the @entity24			1
while the @entity24 does play a part in an airport 's overall security , its role is largely limited to inside the airport building -- the checkpoint security			1
local and airport police handle the outside -- the perimeter security			1
" @entity38 security is a shared security , " @entity35 , a top @entity24 administrator , said at a congressional subcommittee hearing in 2011			1
the @entity24 depends on local police and airport personnel to play the lead role , he said			1
against this backdrop , sunday 's incident has one @entity13 state lawmaker calling for better safety			1
" i have long been concerned about security at our airport perimeters , " state rep. @entity46 tweeted			1
" @entity51 teen demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed			0
" ' no system is 100 % ' in the case of @entity17 , security responsibilities lie not just with the @entity24 , but also with airport and city police			1
six miles of chain link fence enclose the airport			2
much of it , according to @entity61 affiliate @entity60 , is only 6 feet high , topped with barbed wire			0
security cameras offer added surveillance , and " many eyes and ears " monitor the grounds , @entity19 said			0
the airport has surveillance video showing an unidentified person walking on the airport ramp in the dark and approaching a @entity73 @entity11 767			1
but " we do not know at this time if this is the teenage stowaway , " @entity19 said			0
federal investigators who interviewed the teen in @entity14 said he scaled the airport fence in @entity12 , @entity19 said			1
" no system is 100 % , " @entity19 said			0
" and it appears that this teenager scaled a section of our perimeter and was able to proceed onto our ramp under cover of darkness and into the wheel well of an aircraft			1
" @entity73 defended its inspection process			1
" before an aircraft is put into service , safety and security inspections are conducted by @entity73 vendor maintenance personnel to visually review any compartment accessible from the ground , including the wheel well			1
this is standard operating procedure			0
" cockpit crews also conduct exterior walk - arounds at the gate to perform system checks prior to departure			2
the wheel well is not included as part of this checklist			2
at this time , the wheel well doors are closed and the area is not visible			2
" our process meets or exceeds @entity24 requirements and industry standards , " the airline said			1
@entity61 aviation expert @entity115 said it was a " physical feat " that the boy got past all sorts of people , apparently unnoticed			1
" clearly there 's a big security breach here , which in the post- 9/11 world order is a concern			2
" reevaluating protocols the boy landed in @entity14 on sunday and told authorities he ran away from home in @entity128 , @entity13			2
he did n't have any @entity129 ; all he had was a comb			0
he told investigators he crawled into the wheel well and lost consciousness when the plane took off			1
an hour after the plane landed at @entity136 , the boy regained consciousness and was captured on security footage crawling out of the left main gear area of the plane			1
officials at @entity136 said they were re-examining their safety protocols to avoid a repeat			0
@entity14 airport district manager @entity145 told @entity61 affiliate @entity146 that people have scaled the barbed wire fence and gotten onto the tarmac before , but none of them ever got onto a plane			1
" we went out , we did our rounds , did our checks , and it did not appear at any one point that there was entrance onto the airfield , " he said			0
the airport has multiple levels of security , he said : more than 200 cameras , a private security firm , airport police and the @entity24			1
" what we ca n't catch with cameras , we do vehicle patrol			0
we do foot patrols , " he told reporters			0
not the first time plenty of people have hitched a ride on a plane by holing up in a wheel well			1
in february , crews at @entity177 in suburban @entity178 found the body of a man inside the wheel well of an @entity182 operated by @entity183			2
in 2010 , a 16 - year - old boy died after he fell out of the wheel well of a @entity187 flight bound for @entity188 from @entity189 , @entity190			1
a report detailing his death found there were not enough security officers at the @entity195 , one of the fastest - growing airports in the country			2
the most recent known case of someone surviving was on a short domestic flight in @entity202			2
a 15 - year - old boy sneaked into the wheel well of a flight from @entity205 to @entity206 , thinking it was a flight to the @entity208 , according to an @entity210 report			1
the ride lasted only 35 minutes			0
stowaway risk apparently , some airports have a greater risk of stowaways than others			0
many incidents involve people desperately trying to escape their countries			0
after speaking with some @entity11 captains , @entity220 said , " there are designated airfields around the world that various airlines have put a designation of stowaway risk			0
" " what that means is that when the aircraft lands -- @entity235 in @entity236 , for example , in @entity233 ... what the engineers will do is they will drop those doors , " @entity220 said			0
" so when the pilot or the first officer does their walk - around , they can actually look up and see the enormity of the undercarriage bay			2
" but those checks are n't mandated worldwide			0
physical feats it 's not difficult to climb inside a wheel well , said @entity247 , a ground operations coordinator at @entity249 's @entity248			1
" you can grab onto the struts and landing gear assembly kind of like a ladder , and you just jump on the tire and climb into the wheel well			2
" but after takeoff , many scenarios could kill a stowaway hiding in the landing gear wheel well			1
inside , there 's not much room -- even less than in the trunk of a car , @entity247 said			2
a stowaway would need to guess " where the tire is going to fold in when it closes after takeoff			0
there 's a high risk of getting crushed once the gear starts going in			2
" the boy 's survival is " dumb luck , mostly , " said dr. @entity274 , a trauma surgeon at @entity276 's @entity275			1
the temperature outside the airplane could have been as low as 75 or 80 degrees below zero , said @entity274 , who is also a pilot			0
" those are astronomically low temperatures to survive			0
" the boy was probably so cold that " he was essentially in a state of suspended animation , " he said			2
being young probably worked in his favor , too			0
" no adult would have survived that , " @entity274 added			0
the boy could face permanent brain damage from the experience -- in fact , it 's " more likely than not , " he said			1
he could face neurological issues , memory problems or a lower iq			0
the teen also could have frostbite or a kidney injury because when the body freezes , particles of muscle enter the bloodstream and damage the kidneys , @entity274 said			0
concerns about safety the @entity305 dropped out of the investigation once it was confident the teen did n't pose a threat			0
but the boy was n't the only lucky one on this journey ; so were the passengers and officials			0
" if someone can climb inside here , then someone can put something a little more sinister in there , " @entity220 said			0
" and that 's the connection that security officials need to make			0
" 5 stowaway attempts that did n't end tragically			0

" our process meets or exceeds @entity24 requirements , " @entity73 says
a 15 - year - old boy survives a five - hour flight hiding in a plane 's wheel well
the feat raises concerns about what else could slip through an airport 's perimeter
