-- do n't ask music super-producer @entity1 to whip up a no. 1 song for an artist because it ai n't gon na happen			1
sure , the man knows how to make hits : his work on @entity8 's " diamonds " and ke $ ha 's " @entity9 " landed both at the top of the billboard charts			1
but he 's the first to tell you that trying to compose a chart topper is almost always guaranteed to fail			2
" when you 're like , ' @entity17 , we got ta write a hit song , we need a hit song right now , " that never works , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" every time that happens , i never write a hit song			1
i write a s * * * * y song that sounds like someone trying to make a hit song			1
" @entity1 knows of what he speaks			1
two of the songs he helped produce are up for @entity34 this year : @entity36 's " payphone , " nominated for best pop duo or group performance , and @entity40 's " @entity39 , " which is competing for best r&b song			1
@entity1 said in an era where singles rule ( seriously , when was the last time you bought an entire album ? ) the pressure is on labels , artists and producers more than ever to produce a song that will head straight to the top of the charts			1
but what does that song look and sound like ? is it an earworm such as @entity59 's " @entity58 " ? an intensely personal tale such as @entity62 's " @entity61 " or a breezy " i can relate to that " poppy tune such as @entity66 's " @entity65			1
" the answer is yes			2
" everything needs to be a hook , " said @entity1 , who snagged the @entity68 at the @entity69 in 2012 along with @entity70 and @entity71			1
" everything needs to be catchy because a listener is either going to stay with the song or lose interest in the first five seconds			1
but people also like those songs they can relate to and say , ' yeah , i went through that			0
' " @entity82 , senior director of artist promotions at @entity84 , said artists looking for a no. 1 song have to prepare their fans for a release by using every social media tool available : @entity91 videos , tweets , @entity94 postings , etc. @entity84 distributes music for artists through partners such as @entity97 and @entity98 for a nominal fee			1
the company does not , he said , take a percentage of the revenue of the music distributed , and that business model has attracted such well - known acts as @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109 to use the service			2
but if an artist wants to have a true no. 1 smash across the country , he or she will have to resort to some old - fashioned methods , @entity111 said			0
" you really need radio play , and that 's not something everyone can do , " he said			0
" but i still think that 's key to having a no. 1 song			2
" that type of marketing to get airplay can be a pricey proposition			0
just ask @entity128 , an @entity129 executive and manager who works with singers @entity132 and @entity133 there are plenty of songs that are good tunes , @entity128 said , but " when you 've got a record that works , you need a record label that will then work that record			0
" but for a label to justify the expense of promoting an artist , the singer and song have to gel in a way that will connect with the audience , she said			2
" there are certain songs that just encapsulate all you need to know about an artist , " @entity128 said			0
" they are like personality records			0
for instance , ' @entity153 ' by @entity155			0
it was a hit , but it also told you a great deal about who @entity155 was as an artist			2
" @entity128 said the machine involved in promotion has to remain enthusiastic about the project			0
" everyone has to be about the message , " she said			0
" it 's about spreading the message			0
have you heard this song by ... ? " @entity170 , director of charts for @entity171 , said the conundrum the music industry faces is that while albums are n't selling nearly as well as before , the music is bigger than ever			1
" i think music is more popular and accessible today than it 's ever been , " he said			2
" it 's a major component of advertising campaigns , sporting events and anything multimedia			0
" that means the industry now has varying degrees of success , he said , from an artist such as @entity62 , whom he calls " lightning in the bottle " able to sell both singles and albums , to some such as @entity59 , who has sold millions of singles but not as many albums			2
@entity170 said any artist is one hit away from that big break or even a comeback			1
but today 's hit can easily come from performers such as @entity198 , who , @entity170 said , is one of the all - time , top - selling digital download artists despite a lack of recognition as a hitmaker			1
" they are catchy tracks , " @entity170 said of the rapper 's music			1
" i think the challenge with @entity198 has been to put a face with the hits			0
i 'm not sure if you locked 10 people in a room that half of them would realize that all the songs they love are @entity198			0
" producer @entity1 is also not easily recognizable , though he may increasingly be responsible for some of the most played music out these days			1
the process of putting it all together is as much fun as work , he said			0
it often starts with a roomful of friends and lots of food			0
he likes to write with friends , he said , since as soon as he writes anything he usually shares it with them anyway			0
and a hit could occur while he 's chilling in a hot tub or taking a walk : anything as long as the ideas keep flowing			2
" i let the song come to me , " he said			2
" then that thing comes to you , and you just know what that thing is			0
music is n't like a 9 - to - 5 job			1
it 's just the most unpredictable thing			0

a hit song could be a catchy earworm or a *heartfelt* ballad
