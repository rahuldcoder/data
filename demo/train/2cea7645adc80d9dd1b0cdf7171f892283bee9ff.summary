-- @entity1 maintained its unbeaten start to the @entity4 season but were made to sweat against a dogged @entity6 side saturday			1
@entity8 's men have been far and away the best team in @entity10 over recent months but were frustrated by their opponents who thoroughly deserved their point from this hard - fought 0 - 0 draw			1
the blank represents the first time @entity1 have failed to score this season -- but it was n't for the want of trying			1
@entity20 midfielder @entity19 struck a post midway through a first - half that saw @entity1 repeatedly press forward and @entity6 frantically try to keep them at bay			1
@entity26 's men were well drilled and composed , a far cry from the side that conceded eight to @entity29 just a few weeks ago			1
but it was n't all hustle and bustle from the @entity6 who also chances of their own			2
@entity35 came closest when he grazed the crossbar after swiveling to connect with a @entity38 cross			0
@entity6 rope - a - dope a @entity41 header and a stinging drive from @entity43 was the extent of opportunities until midway through the second half			2
@entity6 were quick to hit back with a thumping drive of their own through @entity49 that @entity1 keeper @entity50 did well to block			1
it appeared @entity6 had been applying the rope - a - dope strategy until this point , becoming stronger as the game wore on			0
and as the closing stages approached it looked more likely that they would be the ones to break the deadlock			0
@entity57 screwed wide when it looked easier to score after a shot from @entity60 fell at his feet 13 - yards out			0
the former @entity62 midfielder then fired inches wide from the edge of the box after bursting beyond the @entity1 midfield			0
that would be as close as either side would come to winning it			0
the tie means @entity1 are now seven points clear at the top of the @entity4 table , although that lead could be cut to four points if @entity29 triumph at home to @entity62 sunday			1
@entity78 in the day 's early kick - off , a solitary goal from @entity80 was enough to give @entity82 victory away to @entity84 and ease the pressure on manager @entity86 who has come in for criticism from sections of the @entity82 support in recent weeks			1
there have been no such job security worries for @entity92 despite a similarly sticky start to the @entity4 season			2
the @entity97 's @entity96 side have dug deep to pull together an impressive string of results in recent weeks			2
and their fine form continued saturday with a comfortable 3 - 0 victory at home to @entity103 thanks to goals from @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
elsewhere , @entity108 secured a late victory at home to @entity111 after @entity112 turned in a @entity114 header that had rebounded off the visitors crossbar			0
@entity117 's goal was enough to give @entity118 victory over in - form @entity121 while @entity122 beat @entity123 3 - 2			0
@entity124 were held at home 1 - 1 by @entity126 while @entity4 new boys @entity127 drew 1 - 1 with @entity129 .			2

@entity1 held away to @entity6 in @entity4
@entity8 's men fail to score for first time this season in @entity4
