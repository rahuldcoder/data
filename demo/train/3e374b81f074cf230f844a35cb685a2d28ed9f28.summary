-- president @entity1 has nominated former @entity3 sen. @entity2 as his next defense secretary and anti-terrorism chief @entity5 as @entity7 director			1
@entity9 's nomination could be the most contentious of those @entity1 is making because of positions the former lawmaker took on @entity13 and @entity14 and his opposition to the troop surges in @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity0 's @entity19 on tuesday spoke to @entity20 and @entity22 special correspondent @entity21 about " @entity23 , " the piece he wrote on @entity9 's nomination : @entity0 : @entity21 wrote what i think is ( one of the ) most ... interesting and compelling articles about the @entity9 nomination , explaining it perhaps better than anyone i 've seen , including the president			1
the first paragraph of the piece , you write , it may prove the most consequential foreign policy appointment of his presidency because the struggle over @entity9 is a struggle over whether @entity1 can change the terms of the foreign policy debate			1
@entity21 : i think so far , the debate about military action in @entity14 has been conducted by and large in @entity44 , as if @entity17 and @entity18 did n't happen			1
as if we have n't learned anything from the disaster ( of ) these two wars over the last 10 years			0
i think the real struggle between @entity9 and his foes is he wants to bring some of the lessons in to the @entity14 debate that we learned about ( @entity17 ) and @entity18			1
he talks very compellingly about the fact wars once launched ca n't be fully controlled			0
he is very cognizant of the enormous financial cost that these wars have imposed on the @entity59 , and i think the heart of the hostility is the fear that his recognition about what happened in @entity18 and @entity17 will make taking us to war in @entity14 harder			2
@entity9 vows to fight ' distortions ' @entity0 : you suggest there are no consequences for the @entity71 in terms of those who supported or imposed it			2
@entity21 : what i said if you listen to @entity3 foreign policy discourse , with the exception of a few people like @entity2 , you would think the @entity71 had been a great success			1
because all of the same people who said it was a great success are defining in large measure the debate over war on @entity14 , pushing the @entity59 closer , and i think @entity9 is a ( messenger for ) ... the president to say , " hold on a second here			1
" i am going to set the bar for war higher than @entity89 , and i do n't think this is a simple and easy thing			0
" @entity0 : why does @entity1 need that ? @entity1 opposed the war in @entity17 for longer than @entity2			1
@entity9 voted for the invasion			0
@entity21 : yes , that 's right			2
but ... ( he was ) one of the few @entity3 senators who , after the war started , he began to rethink his view of the world			2
it 's not only about @entity14			0
i think the other big thing about the @entity9 nomination is that @entity1 wants someone to bring the @entity104 back into balance with @entity59 's financial resources			1
@entity0 : is this a smaller foreign policy ? a smaller defense policy ? @entity21 : i think it is			1
the dominant @entity3 way to talk about the defense budget is to completely separate it , wall it off from all considerations about the national debt			0
@entity2 does n't see it that way			0
he 's a lot like @entity119 , who people forget drove the defense budget down quite dramatically because he believed @entity59 's real power was its fiscal health , its economic health			0
@entity125 officials reach out to @entity127 community to answer @entity9 concerns @entity0 : a lot of fire around @entity9 's nomination has to do with @entity13 and @entity9 's support and the lack of support as the case may be for @entity13			1
( here 's ) ... what sen. @entity137 of @entity138 said about @entity9 , " comments he 's made about the so - called @entity127 lobby , which seems to denigrate the efforts of @entity145 individuals , myself included , who view that relationship as a special relationship , one that 's important to our national security and stability in the region			2
" @entity9 suggests he misspoke or should n't have used those words			0
but is this a real problem for him ? @entity21 : no , i think this is really a smoke screen			1
if @entity2 had the same views on @entity14 and defense spending as @entity161 , no one would even be talking about these comments			2
i think it 's really a sideshow			0
one of the most important @entity127 leaders , @entity166 , used the same phrase -- " jewish lobby " -- just last december			0
yes , it would be more accurate to call it , i think , the kind of right - wing , @entity145 lobby			0
but the truth is many of the people in the @entity145 lobby are , in fact , @entity127 , as is myself			0
one of the groups is the @entity179			0
so to suggest this is in any way anti-semitic , when many , many @entity127 , including a rabbi from @entity183 , has testified to ( @entity9 's ) good relationship with ( the ) @entity127 community i think is character assassination , to be honest			1
opinion : @entity3 , do n't fight @entity189 nomination			2

@entity2 's nomination could be most contentious of president @entity1 's second term
*columnist* : @entity9 nomination is @entity1 's attempt to change terms of foreign policy debate
@entity3 @entity9 *initially* supported war in @entity17 but later became an opponent
@entity21 calls opposition over @entity9 's past comments about @entity13 a " smoke screen "
