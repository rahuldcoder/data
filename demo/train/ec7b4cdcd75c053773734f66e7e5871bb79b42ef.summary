-- there has been much speculation about whether the ads that president @entity5 's campaign and its supporters have been running that are critical of @entity9 's tenure at @entity10 will be effective			1
there is also lots of critiquing of the reasons and effectiveness of first lady @entity16 's appearances on talk shows and reality shows ( " @entity19 , " " @entity20 , " " @entity21 , " etc. )			2
but something i saw last night indicates the @entity10 ads are starting to have an effect , and that women view @entity16 as a positive -- a conduit to the president			1
i was invited to sit in remotely on two focus groups of so - called " @entity34 " moms in @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33			1
both groups -- 23 women , in all -- were screened to ensure the moms were not strong partisans on either side , and most identified themselves as independents and undecided			1
the @entity33 group was all @entity42			0
it was a fascinating exercise that confirmed just how tight the presidential campaign will be			0
but what struck me most was that while @entity9 is still largely an unknown with these women -- and as such still has room and opportunity to define himself -- many of them said they did not like what they had heard described from ads about his time as head of @entity10			1
they gave him kudos for being a businessman , saying that would be a good attribute for a president in creating jobs , but they also underscored what they had heard in the ads that had been running in their hometowns			2
they used phrases like " i heard that while he was the head of a company , many workers lost their jobs ... " " that scares me			0
" when asked to use one word or phrase to describe @entity9 , the words or phrases they used included " do n't know that much about him , " " selfish , " businessman who is concerned with making himself some money , " " concerned about the wealthy , " " ca n't be trusted , " " scares me , " and " lackluster " -- again , echoing some of what is being said in the @entity10 ads around the country			1
they did admire him for being a " good family man , " and some of the women appreciated his corporate success but others followed up with " the country is more than a business ... a country has to take care of its people			1
" sound familiar ? some also gave him credit for having passed a health care plan in @entity97 , one he is now running away from on the campaign trail			0
opinion : ' @entity101 ' label could hurt @entity5 's chances so while in the minds of many of these women , @entity9 is largely undefined , what they apparently do know and feel about him seems to echo those @entity10 ads -- and look to represent a beginning sketch of someone they can not trust			1
to be clear , these women were not in the tank for @entity5 -- but that was the whole point for the exercise to begin with			2
many have been disappointed with his " lack of keeping his promises , " and many said they have n't seen the change that he talked about so much in 2008			0
when asked to use a word or phrase to describe @entity5 , they used " false promises , " " not a lot of change , " " big government			2
" but by and large , the women in both of these groups would then follow up with phrases or explanations that would seem to indicate they understood just how difficult a situation he was handed when he came into office			1
many stated " he ca n't do it in three years , " or " he has been productive but he is hitting walls , " and " he came into a big mess and has made some improvements			0
" it seemed very fertile ground for the @entity5 campaign to make the @entity146 argument also used by president @entity147 2004 , the one about not changing horses midstream			0
based on their words , these women were most concerned about the economy , jobs and housing			0
and again , words associated with @entity9 , such as " concerned for the wealthy , " seemed to indicate a disconnect with what families were struggling with			1
interestingly , neither group had any idea what the " gender gap " was			0
but as they were led in a conversation about issues important to women -- which were inextricably linked to the economy and concern for the health and future of their children -- women in both groups volunteered that @entity16 was someone to further the interests of women and their families			1
the president " listens to @entity16 , " they said			0
some in the @entity179 mom group went further and said that @entity16 's interests are their interests because she is a woman and a minority			0
and because of this , the president would make sure their interests are represented			0
in their eyes , she was them			0
there is no doubt there are opportunities here for @entity9 to work on filling in the blanks , because there are many			2
but if the old adage is right , that in politics you need to define yourself before your opponent does , then the @entity9 campaign will need to more fully explain his time at @entity10 , including why he made millions even as he fired workers and closed companies , denying workers their health care and pensions			1
because right now , what has the potential to sink in is an image of @entity9 as head of @entity10			1
that , at least with this small sliver of moms in key battleground states , is one that scares them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219			2

@entity219 says she observed two focus groups of women asked about *candidates*
she says most still know little of @entity9 ; many thought he *put* business before people
she says ads tying him to job losses , *takeovers* while he was at @entity10 are working
@entity219 : the women think the first lady would represent their interests
