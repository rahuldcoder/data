-- it 's a fear that keeps cybersecurity experts up at night : an attack on an online election system			1
apparently , it 's now come to pass			2
according to a grand jury report about problems in an august 14 , 2012 , primary election in @entity9 , @entity15 , " someone created a computer program that automatically , systematically and rapidly submitted to the @entity9 's @entity8 numerous bogus on - line requests for absentee ballots			1
" it 's the first documented attack on a @entity18 election , said computer scientist @entity19 , who is on the board of the @entity21 and the @entity22 , in an interview with @entity0			1
the report notes that 2,500 fraudulent requests were submitted			1
( for perspective , @entity9 mailed out 139,047 absentee ballots last july and another 174,919 in october			1
) with voting by mail increasing , the fact that the system was challenged is worrisome for cybersecurity experts			0
" the computer scientists have been saying for many years now that this is going to be possible , and one of the counters to us has been , ' how come it has n't happened ? ' we always say , we do n't know if it 's happened , because it might happen without leaving any evidence , " said @entity32 , a @entity33 computer science professor who is an expert in cybersecurity			2
" and now we 're finally starting to see proof that it actually does happen			0
" @entity19 , who classified the attack as " weak , " nevertheless highlighted several reasons to be concerned			1
" it 's clear that the attackers knew what they were doing , did it deliberately ( and ) tried to cover their tracks -- they were deliberately hiding their actions , " he said			1
moreover , he added , " it is not at all clear what their motives were			2
" according to the report , @entity9 's online ballot request system had " very low " security , with no user - specific logins or passwords			2
a concerned election vendor noted the influx of requests and flagged them , said the report			1
" the vendor hired by @entity68 officials ... became suspicious when it appeared that an extraordinary number of absentee ballot requests 1 ) appeared to be submitted from the same group of computers ; and 2 ) were being submitted at a rate that was not humanly possible if the data on the screen was being entered by a person , " the report said			1
the requests came from @entity78 addresses primarily located overseas , the report added , " although there was at least one fraudulent request from inside the @entity18			1
" the grand jury report is dated december 19 , 2012			1
its findings were reported last month by the @entity84 , although they did not receive widespread national attention until now			0
@entity15 , of course , is no stranger to electoral snafus			2
in 2012 alone , the state endured long lines , chaotic polling places and disputes over legislative actions that shortened the number of days and hours for early voting			2
but @entity19 says that , in terms of online issues , the state is far from the worst			2
he said he and his colleagues in the cybersecurity community found two states that had " serious vulnerabilities " in their online registration systems : @entity105 and @entity106			0
" those dangers were so severe because it would not take a lot of skill to change the registrations of thousands of voters , online , while sitting in , say , @entity114 , " he said			0
with hackers getting increasingly sophisticated , @entity32 expects there will be more cyberattacks in the future			0
indeed , even putting elections aside , reports of denial - of - service attacks , stolen passwords and other cases of internet invasion are regular occurrences in the news -- and they 've affected major corporations , government agencies and even security companies , @entity19 observes			2
that does n't mean we have to revert back to dropping paper ballots in an old wooden box			0
@entity32 believes that election authorities " do a pretty good job at understanding their threats			0
" it 's just that voting is such a sensitive issue that they should have to plan for the worst -- and be prepared to handle it			0
" the first thing to do is have a realistic understanding of the threat , so that before you offer a service on the internet you know how you 're going to respond when you 're attacked -- and i say ' when ' and not ' if ' you 're attacked , " he said			0
indeed , @entity19 hopes that the @entity9 report serves as a wake - up call for authorities who have scoffed at computer scientists ' concerns			1
" for me , of course , this is no surprise			0
i 've seen this and much worse in many circumstances , " he said			0
" but because this is the first real documented attack in a @entity18 election , it has outsized importance			1
we can now say we do have an example in a @entity18 election of a bona fide cyberattack			1
you do n't have to believe us -- we did n't write that grand jury report			1
" cyberthreats getting worse , @entity171 intelligence officials warn @entity173 , senior managing director for @entity174 , is optimistic that the wake - up call will be received promptly			0
" if you look back , 20 , 25 years , ( legislators ) had no real understanding of computers			0
but over time , it 's kind of a rising tide " of comprehension , he says			0
" as you get more specialists in a field like this , i think the risks become more evident , and it becomes more urgent for them to do something about it			0
