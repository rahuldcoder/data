the whole world is a depressing gray color that just makes you want to lie on the couch and watch reruns of " @entity6			0
" you do n't have time to pack your gym bag , drop off the kids , drive to the fitness studio , shower and change , pick up the kids and get back home before dinner			1
plus , you 're really tired of floor mats that reek and that woman in the back row who always steps left instead of right , effectively knocking you down on your out - of - shape gluteus maximus			0
whatever your reason is for not wanting to hit the gym , @entity22 of @entity23 understands			1
" i do n't even want to go to my own studio when it 's raining , " she said with a laugh			0
that 's why late last year , she and her sister , @entity30 , launched @entity31 , a web service that streams three or four of their franchise 's group classes every day			1
subscribers can log in at home and participate in classes like " @entity38 " or " @entity39 " from their living room			1
the classes stay online for 24 hours and then are replaced with the next day 's workouts			1
unlimited subscription passes are $ 15 a month			0
online video streaming is just starting to blossom in the fitness industry , @entity45 editor @entity44 says			1
several sites offer similar programs , including @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
" it seems like the next natural progression to home fitness dvds , " @entity44 said			2
" it 's another way of making fitness more convenient for yourself			2
" knee was shocked by how quickly the live service caught on with her regular members			2
people were doing classes on their lunch break at work or logging in while on vacation			1
" you know you have a [ workout ] dvd , and it 's an awesome dvd , but the girl tells the same joke every day , " @entity22 said			2
" this is always live , always fresh , and you feel like you 're there			2
" @entity78 is one of the reasons @entity81 loves group fitness classes			1
but when @entity81 moved to the suburbs from @entity85 , she was disappointed with the caliber of local studios			2
the businesswoman remembered how much her colleagues at @entity90 had loved video conferencing during meetings			2
her subsequent research on online paid content revealed astonishing numbers : in 2010 , the @entity96 raked in $ 500 million in revenue from its streaming services ; @entity99 earned $ 450 million			1
@entity101 's digital revenue totaled more than $ 1.5 billion			0
so @entity81 launched @entity52 , an internet - based fitness studio that streams classes from instructors across the country			1
there 's no subscription for @entity81 ' site ; classes are bought for $ 5 apiece			2
in @entity81 ' opinion , the fitness industry is dragging its feet in making the transition online			1
the brick - and - mortar gyms are afraid of catalyzing their current market , she says			0
" it 's going to be like @entity101 was to @entity116			0
@entity116 refused to let go of that model , and look at what happened to them			0
" ( @entity116 filed for bankruptcy in september 2010 )			0
@entity81 ' target market is stay - at - home mothers and people who are obese			2
but online classes appeal to anyone who 's uncomfortable in a gym setting , @entity44 says			1
" you hear , ' i ca n't go to the gym until i get in shape , ' " @entity44 said			0
" this gives them privacy ... to experience it on their own without feeling self - conscious			0
this could go a long way to promoting compliance because it 's convenient and portable			0
" @entity44 says personal trainers also use online video libraries to encourage clients to keep up with their workouts			1
while on - demand fitness video libraries are nothing new , they 're becoming more elaborate			1
fitness company @entity143 recently introduced hd - quality , customized video workouts on @entity53			1
the workouts are led by the " @entity147 , " a team of six instructors who have a variety of areas of expertise			0
@entity53 asks new users questions about their ability levels and goals			1
it then uses the site 's " @entity159 " technology to analyze and stream a personalized workout			1
by adding the video service , ceo @entity161 and his producers have turned the site into one giant personal trainer			0
" it does n't put you in a certain bucket , " @entity161 said			0
" it learns about you as you go , constantly monitoring what workout you did yesterday , are you hitting a plateau			0
... people really want to stay motivated and be told what to do			0
" nearly 20 % of all tvs worldwide will be connected to the internet by 2016 , according to @entity176 , which will make it even easier for online fitness videos to infiltrate @entity179 's living rooms			1
put bluntly , there are no more excuses			0
" people are realizing more and more that there 's not a magic pill for [ weight loss ] , " @entity161 said			0
