@entity0 in @entity8 , it completes what has been a seemingly smooth transition of power in the world 's most populous nation			0
but who is he ? as with all @entity18 leaders , details of the @entity3 's life are tightly controlled , creating a gap that biographies -- some written under pseudonyms , given the political sensitivities -- have sought to fill			1
@entity24 watchers meanwhile try to discern how he would lead			0
" @entity18 leaders do n't rise to the top telegraphing what changes they 'll do , " said @entity26 , a political science professor at @entity28 's @entity27			1
" they rise to the top showing how loyal they are to the incumbent			0
what they 'll do when they rise to the top -- that 's the big question			0
" @entity3 was born in 1953 , four years after the @entity4 defeated the ruling @entity40 and established the @entity18			1
he is the son of the second marriage of @entity42 , a revolutionary hero whom then - paramount leader @entity43 would appoint minister of propaganda and education			1
@entity42 would later become vice premier under @entity47 and secretary general of the @entity49 , @entity24 's highest administrative body , before being purged in 1962			0
until then , @entity3 had grown up a " princeling " with other children of @entity24 's first generation of leaders in the enclave of power in @entity8 known as @entity57			1
one childhood peer was @entity59 , son of @entity60 , the first finance minister who was also purged during the @entity61			0
life was comfortable and far removed from the mass starvation during @entity43 's disastrous " @entity67 " campaign ( 1958 - 1962 ) , which was designed to transform the nation into an industrial society			2
however , a few years later , @entity3 -- his father by then deposed -- would be among 30 million " sent - down youth , " forced to leave cities for the countryside and mountains under another of @entity43 's policies			2
from 1969 - 1975 , or most of the @entity61 , @entity3 was an agricultural laborer in @entity76 , @entity77 , his ancestral province			2
" that generation went through a lot of difficulties , " said @entity78 , director of research at the @entity80 at the @entity81			0
" idealism and pragmatism in a very unique way combined in this generation			0
" the experience had a positive influence on @entity3 's view of @entity24 and the world , according to @entity91 , chairman of @entity92 , the publisher of " @entity24 's future : a biography of @entity3			1
" " even after he became a leader , he helped farmers , " @entity91 said			0
his favorite story was of the @entity98 - bound @entity3 in 1975 being accompanied by villagers who walked 60 li ( 30 km ) to send him off at a train station			2
when @entity43 died in 1976 , @entity3 's father was subsequently rehabilitated and became party secretary of @entity105 , where he oversaw @entity24 's first special economic zones near @entity0 -- reforms that would define then paramount leader @entity109 's economic legacy			1
the elder @entity3 's connections proved critical			1
after graduating from @entity98 with a chemical engineering degree in 1979 , @entity3 became the personal secretary to his father 's former comrade - in - arms , @entity115 , and became an active military service member			1
as vice premier , a member of the @entity4 's @entity122 and secretary general of the @entity124 , @entity115 " dominated @entity117 , government and the army , " according to " @entity125 , " affording @entity3 a rare vantage point			1
such military ties -- familial and professional -- give him what neither @entity5 nor his predecessor @entity128 had , said @entity130 , president of the @entity131			1
" the military takes him as one of the family members			0
" it was around this period that @entity3 was married to his first wife , @entity137 , the daughter of @entity139 , @entity24 's ambassador to @entity140 and a former underling of @entity42 , according to " @entity125			2
" not much is known about the marriage except that it ended in divorce within a few years			0
in 1987 , @entity3 would marry his current wife , @entity144 , a popular folk singer for the @entity145			0
read how @entity3 is considered a " mystery " in 1982 , when his father entered the ruling @entity122 and the @entity148 , @entity3 became county deputy secretary in @entity150 , @entity151 province , his first experience in rural politics			0
in this role , he took his first trip to the @entity156 -- as part of an agricultural delegation in 1985 to @entity151 's " sister state " of @entity160 -- and brought back knowledge of farming technology as well as tourism			1
this trip had a great impact on @entity3 , who stayed with a family in @entity168 , said @entity169 , chairman of @entity170 , which recently published a separate " biography of @entity3			2
" " vocally , he 's a nationalist			0
psychologically , he greatly hopes to keep good relations with the @entity181 , especially the @entity156 , " @entity169 said , noting that @entity3 's daughter , @entity175 , studies there -- at @entity177 -- under a pseudonym			1
in a major policy speech in @entity183 in february 2012 , @entity3 called for increasing strategic trust and reducing suspicions while respecting each other 's core interests , such as the " @entity24 policy " that opposes @entity189 and @entity191 independence			1
in an indirect reference to the @entity195 administration 's " rebalancing " strategy toward @entity196 , @entity3 said , " we hope the @entity156 will respect the interests and concerns of @entity24 and other countries in the region			1
" nonetheless , @entity3 got high marks for his desire to engage with the @entity156 , and his trip included meetings with president @entity195 , vice president @entity207 , then - secretary of state @entity208 and then - defense secretary @entity209			1
also not overlooked was the fact @entity3 chose to make a nostalgic stop in @entity160 , in addition to @entity213 , during his five - day @entity156 tour			1
" from my conversations with people in the @entity156 , the reigning understanding is , ' this is a guy we can work with , ' " said @entity215 , director of the @entity216 at @entity217			0
@entity130 of the @entity131 echoed the sentiments , calling @entity3 " relaxed , very at ease to talk with people " and a departure from @entity4 leaders who tend to be " very cautious " when talking			2
read about how @entity156 , @entity24 are worlds apart but joined meanwhile , " @entity3 's leadership experience [ after @entity150 ] in running @entity232 , @entity233 , and @entity234 , three economically - advanced regions , has prepared him well for pursuing policies to promote the development of the private sector , foreign investment and trade , and the liberalization of @entity24 's financial system , " wrote @entity78 of @entity81 for the @entity229 in its winter 2012 edition			1
the run - up to @entity3 's ascension as @entity24 's next leader has nonetheless been bumpy			1
in september , his nearly two - week " disappearance " -- and canceled meetings with @entity251 and other foreign officials -- fueled speculation over his health and factional infighting			0
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity255 , former @entity0 chief executive @entity253 said @entity3 had suffered a back injury while swimming			2
even so , the @entity18 media 's " default mode " of not speaking about its leaders , coupled with the lack of a constitutional basis for the regime 's transfer of power , left people wondering , " what 's the @entity266 if something were to happen ? " @entity215 said			1
also of note were two reports released by @entity270 on september 28 within three minutes of each other : the @entity7 ' november 8 opening date -- after much speculation it would fall in october -- and the expulsion of @entity59 from the @entity4			0
@entity60 now faces criminal prosecution in the wake of a scandal that saw his wife convicted of murder			0
the clean reputation of @entity3 -- who had become @entity234 's leader after his predecessor , @entity283 , was dismissed over a social security fund scandal -- took a hit last june when @entity286 reported on the wealth of his extended family			2
although no assets were traced to @entity3 , his wife or daughter , @entity286 found that his extended family had business interests in minerals , real estate and mobile - phone equipment , with assets in the hundreds of millions			0
in october the @entity297 gave a similar treatment to premier @entity299 , reporting on the staggering wealth of his relatives -- a review that found assets of at least $ 2.7 billion			0
@entity3 and the new leaders will have to demonstrate to the public how serious they are in fighting widespread corruption , @entity215 said , or face " huge problems			2

as with all @entity18 leaders , government tightly controls details of @entity3 's life
@entity3 is the son of a revolutionary hero , grew up a " princeling "
@entity3 has military ties that predecessors @entity5 , @entity128 do n't , one *observer* notes
@entity3 received high marks during @entity183 trip for desire to engage @entity156
