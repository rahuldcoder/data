-- the @entity2 's initial search is nearing its end			1
as the underwater sonar device plunged into the @entity6 , kicking off its 14th mission , authorities are focusing on what they will do if it comes up empty			2
that outcome would seem likely			0
the @entity2 has slowly scoured 95 % of the ocean floor that searchers had narrowed down for it			1
so far , it has found no trace of @entity15			2
anticipation is growing as this phase of the search nears its end , but experts say factors like the depth and terrain of the search area mean that the mission 's completion could be a day to weeks away			1
if nothing is found , the first step , @entity27 officials said , may be to expand the search area where the submersible was looking			1
the underwater search so far has focused on a circle with a 10 - kilometer ( 6.2 - mile ) radius around the location of a detected " ping , " the @entity31 said			1
if the @entity2 - 21 searches 100 % of the area with nothing to show for it , the underwater search may expand to outside that radius			1
" we are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to continue the search into the future , " the @entity27 - based center coordinating the search said in a statement			1
forty - nine days since the plane vanished , @entity52 and @entity27 authorities are mapping out a strategy for a long - term search that could expand to cover a massive area			1
a @entity57 source told @entity0 on friday that the current search area is expected to move slightly north if the @entity2 does n't find any wreckage			1
specifically , it might shift to encompass a 6 - mile radius around where another " ping " was detected			1
and it 's possible the search for the plane -- which disappeared march 8 after leaving @entity67 , @entity52 , for @entity68 -- could balloon			1
@entity6 search specialist @entity69 thinks it may end up including all 370 miles ( 595 kilometers ) of what authorities believe was the plane 's flight path			1
" if the idea is to go more strategic and investigate the entire aircraft flight path , maybe 15 miles or so either side , then you need a more strategic tool			0
and something like a deep - towed sonar that can provide a very large range indeed -- at the expense of resolution			2
" the use of a deep - towed submersible device called the @entity87 is overdue , said @entity88 , managing director of @entity89			1
" that should be brought in as quickly as possible , again , from the @entity91			0
" early into mission 13 , @entity2 - 21 encountered a software issue which required resetting			1
the problem was resolved , the @entity31 announced			0
@entity52 's report facing anger from families of flight 370 passengers , @entity52 's prime minister said thursday his government will release its preliminary report on the plane 's disappearance			1
in a tv exclusive with @entity0 aviation correspondent @entity106 , prime minister @entity104 told @entity0 the report will be available to the public next week			1
he also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week , his office said			2
@entity104 discussed why he is not yet officially declaring the flight -- and the 239 people on board -- lost			0
the report has been sent to the @entity116 , the @entity118 body for global aviation , but not yet made available to the public			1
the @entity118 organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by @entity52 that the aviation world needs to look at real - time tracking of commercial aircraft			1
it 's the same recommendation that was made after the @entity129 went down in the @entity130 in 2009			0
skeptical relatives the prime minister 's comments did n't convince @entity134 , whose partner , @entity135 , was a passenger on the plane			1
she accused @entity104 of " political maneuvering , " shirking responsibility and deflecting blame			0
" i spent most of the morning with my jaw basically scraping the floor , " @entity134 told @entity0 's " ac360Â °			0
" @entity52 authorities need to do a better job of communicating with the families and answering their questions during briefings , she said , rather than treating passengers ' loved ones " as if we are the enemy , as opposed to an interested party in helping to solve this mystery			1
" " actions speak louder than words , " she said			0
" the briefings are a joke			0
... the patience level of the families group is just gone			0
" the husband of passenger @entity159 said he appreciated that the prime minister is avoiding declaring the plane lost and admitted that mistakes were made			2
but he wants to see more from officials			0
" at least one can hope this is the beginning of the next few weeks where we can see a lot more transparency , a lot more directness , " @entity164 told @entity0 's " @entity171			0
" a committee representing some of the @entity174 families have posted 26 questions about the plane 's disappearance on the @entity174 social media site @entity178			2
@entity52 has insisted it has nothing to hide and is working to find answers			2
the country has not been known as a model of transparency			0
the same political party has ruled for 50 years , and the media are not completely free			0
the @entity186 has agreed to have an international team investigate the disappearance of flight 370 , acting transportation minister @entity190 said			0
he also said the team will not be looking into the criminal aspects of the investigation , which remain under the @entity195			0
turning to @entity196 ? angry families dissatisfied with responses from @entity52 authorities could turn their attention to the @entity202 's manufacturer			2
some of the questions the families have , including technical questions , " we will be bringing directly to @entity196 , " @entity134 said			0
" @entity196 is a publicly traded company in the @entity91 , and that puts them in a position of a little bit more fiduciary responsibility , " she said			0
asked for a response , @entity196 sent @entity0 a statement : " our thoughts and deepest sympathies continue to be with the families and loved ones of those aboard @entity15			0
@entity196 continues to serve as a technical adviser to the @entity91 national transportation ( safety ) board , and in that role we have been an active and engaged party to the investigation			0
" " @entity196 has a shareholders meeting next week , " @entity134 said , adding it might be worth trying to get some answers there			2
what if flight 370 is never found ? inside a black box investigation lab sad , angry relatives in agonizing limbo @entity0 's @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			2

@entity57 source : the search should shift slightly north if no wreckage is found
@entity2 - 21 may expand search area if it does n't make any findings in current search radius
submersible has combed 95 % of a search area with no *significant* results
@entity52 says it will make its report on the missing plane public next week
