-- the @entity2 diplomatic cables obtained and released by @entity3 frequently rely on unnamed sources for delicate information			1
but one such source -- a businessman in @entity8 -- has furiously denied making remarks about high - level corruption attributed to him by a @entity2 diplomat			1
a cable dated january 2010 sent by then @entity14 at the @entity2 @entity15 covered allegations about officials enabling drug trafficking by accepting bribes			1
they were based on a source who said he had " personally seen " one senior official [ who is named in the cable ] " receiving pay - offs quite openly			2
" but now that source insists such words never left his mouth			2
" i feel i have been used			2
this is all @entity14 's own agenda			2
he obviously imagined i would never read what he had written , " the source told the state - run @entity31 ( @entity31 )			1
several current and former officials came under attack in the cable in question			2
@entity14 wrote that his source had told him the country 's ruling party , @entity39 , " brazenly squeezes the business community for kickbacks			0
" the source also supposedly called the country 's president a " vicious scorpion who will sting you , " and said @entity39 and an alleged drug lord had their own clearing agent at a port			1
in an interview with @entity31 , @entity14 's source admits meeting him in 2009 but says he only told the diplomat of problems he was having with his business			0
when asked about other things , the source said , " i just told him i did n't know			0
i only knew what i read in the papers			0
" a similar case surfaced in a leaked cable from @entity63			1
in march 2009 , the @entity2 @entity15 in @entity64 sent a dispatch insinuating that a regional @entity67 commander , general @entity66 , was involved in drug trafficking			1
the source 's name was redacted , but he suggested the general was coordinating drug shipments with another man who was later arrested for smuggling drugs hidden in consignments of frozen fish			1
@entity76 , now the head of @entity63 's military , strongly denied the allegation and has threatened to bring legal action against the ambassador who wrote the cable			0
the wife of @entity84 's president has sued a @entity84 newspaper for $ 15 million following its publication of allegations contained in a leaked cable that she was linked to and profited from illegal diamond sales in the southern @entity93 country			1
the accusations in the @entity8 cable echo comments in several others from the country between july 2009 and january of this year			1
there are reports of officials routinely taking payoffs to turn a blind eye to drug shipments			1
one summary says bluntly : " @entity8 has been called the second most active narcotics transit point in @entity93			1
" the @entity106 would not comment on the leaked cables that were supposedly authored by @entity14			1
a profile on the networking website @entity110 lists @entity14 as now working at the @entity15 in @entity111			0
in a cable from november 2009 , @entity14 writes , " the decrease in drug - related arrests at @entity115 is not attributable to improved interdiction efforts but rather increased police and customs involvement in drug smuggling			2
a high level law enforcement official admits most police drug seizures are not reported to his office because traffickers and police make on - the - spot arrangements to allow the drugs to continue to flow			2
" several attempts by @entity0 seeking comment from @entity8 's government were unsuccessful , but the @entity129 released a statement denying the accusations			1
" this information does not have any support base and undermines the image , prestige and good name of the @entity139 state and its leaders , " said the statement reported by @entity8			1
@entity14 said one prominent businessman , @entity146 , was " described by multiple contacts as the largest narcotrafficker in @entity8 " with contacts at senior levels of the government			1
@entity146 is also a donor to the ruling party			0
earlier this year , president @entity149 identified @entity146 under the @entity150 , and the @entity151 subsequently sanctioned businesses he owned , calling him a " large - scale narcotics trafficker			0
" @entity146 strenuously denied the allegations in a news conference , saying he had never been involved with drugs			0
as for his relationship with @entity39 , he said : " i am a member of the party , and i gave financial support for the good of the country and the good of the party			0
" he denied receiving any favors from the ruling party and said all of his goods passed through port scanners			0
a cable from july 2009 said a source within @entity39 had described a customs official as " the @entity172			0
" six months later , @entity14 wrote that same official had purchased real estate " valued at well beyond what his government salary should be able to afford			0
" the official 's office told @entity0 he was on vacation and would n't be available for comment until later this month			2
@entity14 contended that of the more than ten drug seizures during 2009 , none had led to prosecutions as of january 2010			2
he said a senior law enforcement officer admitted most seizures are n't made public because officials ask for bribes and keep the drugs for resale			0
@entity14 also said police told @entity15 officers they were n't willing " to go after ' big fish ' narcotraffickers because of their ties to senior officials			0
" not every official is accused of living a double standard			0
" @entity8 's @entity200 ( at ) has garnered a reputation for honesty and transparency , " @entity14 wrote in july 2009			1
" @entity8 most certainly is not yet a thoroughly - corrupted narco - state , " he says			1
but , " money laundering , related government corruption ( possibly even official support ) , and ties to @entity209 mean that the problem has the potential to get much worse			0
" @entity212 , which monitors corruption worldwide , said in a 2009 report that " the end of hostilities provided increased corruption opportunities , through the development of a market economy in the context of a weak state			0
" @entity0 's @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
