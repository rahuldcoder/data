-- thirteen @entity2 deputy fire chiefs have signed a letter of " no confidence " in fire chief @entity5 regarding his handling of the @entity8 bombings , according to the letter , which @entity0 independently obtained from a deputy chief who signed it but requested anonymity			1
the deputy chiefs wrote of their displeasure to @entity2 mayor @entity15 on april 26 , according to the letter			1
" you can unequivocally consider this letter a vote of no confidence in @entity23 , " the deputy chiefs wrote in the letter			1
they said the chief failed to assume command responsibility or show any leadership at the scene			2
" despite the fact that the members of the @entity33 command staff have become accustomed to this ' ghost fire chief , ' nothing prepared us for his actions , actually inactions , on the day of the horrific terrorist attack at the @entity8 , " the letter reads			1
" at a time when the @entity42 of @entity2 needed every first responder to take decisive action , @entity23 failed to get involved in operational decision - making or show any leadership , " the letter continues			1
in the letter , the deputies describe an e-mail that @entity5 sent to all department members , saying that when he arrived at the scene , " it was clear that our command officer had the incident well in hand and that our department was fully active in a support role with our law enforcement partners			1
" the deputies call @entity5 's argument " illogical " and " mere rationalization to justify his behavior , " saying that when @entity5 arrived , the @entity61 was " still heavily involved in the incident " because of the possibility of " second explosions , " " additional suspicious packages " and " structural stability concern of buildings , " among other issues			1
but @entity5 defended his actions to @entity0			2
" in their estimation , they believe that if you do n't assume command , you do n't have responsibility there for what goes on , " he said			0
" i tried to explain to them , if i 'm on the scene , i 'm still responsible			0
but they do n't believe it			0
" @entity2 's top cop asked if bombing was preventable the chief told the @entity89 that he was comfortable with the way his commanders were handling the incident			1
" the nationally accepted practice is that you only take command ( as chief ) if there 's something going wrong or if you can strengthen the command position or if it 's overwhelming for the incident commander , and none of those things were in fact happening , " he told the paper			2
the president of the @entity107 , @entity108 , told @entity0 wednesday that he was at the finish line shortly after the bombings and " personally i did n't see anything but selfless heroic acts on the part of the fire , @entity115 and police personnel			1
" but @entity108 added , " if all 13 of our district chiefs are expressing no confidence then that concerns me			2
" he said if the mayor did not act in response to the letter that the @entity107 , which funds the fire department , would look into the functioning of fire department command during upcoming budget discussions			0
the twin blasts at the end of the @entity8 on april 15 killed three people and wounded more than 260 others			2
six people remained hospitalized wednesday , according to a @entity0 count			0
one of two bombing suspects , @entity134 , died after a gunfight with authorities four days later			0
after much secrecy and protest , he was buried in a rural @entity141 cemetery this month			0
