-- assassinations of high - profile government figures are not new to @entity3			1
some result from gruesome car bombs , ripping through people and buildings along bustling streets in cities like @entity10			0
for years , when such blasts occurred , @entity11 gen. @entity13 led the investigations			1
he was credited with overhauling his nation 's intelligence forces , finding those responsible for targeted killings and preventing fresh attacks			0
@entity19 and at least two others died in a massive explosion friday in the typically peaceful and cosmopolitan @entity23 district of @entity10 that he called home			0
@entity3 on edge after @entity27 intel official killed by @entity10 car bomb the attack -- in broad daylight , at one of the capital 's busiest intersections -- was just the kind of thing the intelligence official worked so diligently to prevent			1
but beyond its potential impact on @entity3 's security , @entity13 's life and death illustrates the deep political and religious fissures within @entity3 society -- fissures that could be widened amid spillover from @entity45 's bloody civil war			1
" the person who was the master of uncovering these kind of things ... is gone , " said @entity46 , a senior scholar at the @entity47 who , like @entity13 , is affiliated with @entity3 's " march 14 " movement			1
" so unfortunately , the @entity3 are bracing for more assassinations			1
" @entity19 was more than just @entity3 's top intelligence official			1
he was an icon among many fellow @entity54 , including those aligned with the opposition led by @entity57 , for his leadership and efforts in rooting out those responsible for targeted killings in @entity3			1
but as much as he was loved by some , others despised him -- especially those backing @entity45 president @entity65 and those affiliated with @entity67 , the @entity69 militant and political movement that has a prominent role in @entity3 's government			1
the @entity74 government labels it a terrorist organization			0
" this is a very polarizing figure , " said @entity76 , a fellow at the @entity77 think tank who teaches in @entity10			0
in his position with @entity3 's @entity82 , @entity13 tackled one of the nation 's bloodiest and politically volatile attacks , which occurred on february 14 , 2005 , in @entity10 's fashionable seaside @entity87 district			1
on that day , an explosive - laden truck detonated as the motorcade of former prime minister @entity91 -- @entity57 's father -- passed by , killing the dignitary and 22 others			0
as @entity57 's chief of protocol , @entity13 himself might have been among the dead had he not taken that day off to take a university exam			2
details from @entity13 's investigation were shared with @entity103 investigators , who concluded the assassination may have been linked to high - ranking @entity45 officials ( despite denials from @entity107 )			1
a @entity103 tribunal went on to indict four @entity67 members , and left the door open for more to be charged , though that group 's leader , @entity111 , blamed @entity113 for @entity57 's death			0
@entity19 spearheaded several other investigations into a series of killings that targeted major @entity27 political figures			2
and he is credited with uncovering an @entity113 spy network that involved @entity3 agents , including a top aide to @entity67 's powerful @entity123 ally , @entity122			1
his latest big break , occurring in late august , came with the arrest of a former @entity3 minister and current member of parliament , @entity128			2
@entity3 security forces claim a recording shows @entity131 -- who has close ties with @entity107 and is now in jail awaiting trial -- attempting to smuggle in explosives intended to be used in religious and political assassinations			2
two @entity45 security officers also were charged			0
" unfortunately , today , @entity13 paid the price for his success , " @entity57 said			2
twice in the years after @entity91 's death , @entity13 had skirted death			0
the second assassination attempt left one of his top aides , @entity147 , dead			0
with his absence , others within @entity3 's security apparatus will step into his place			0
photos : aftermath of the @entity10 blast but describing friday as " a grim day , " @entity46 said finding someone who can do the same thing as @entity13 -- whom she lauds for his " great achievements " in unraveling complex cases -- will be difficult			2
" i do n't think @entity13 -- somebody with his experience , with his background -- is going to be replaced very easily , " she said .			0

@entity11 . gen. @entity13 was a top intelligence official in @entity3
aligned with an @entity27 , @entity164 faction , he led many probes into assassinations
fellow @entity54 saw him as an icon , while he was despised by others
a scholar linked to the opposition calls @entity13 a " master " who will be difficult to replace
