the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , a group aimed at safeguarding intellectual property rights in @entity4 , sent an email to its 216 members late last month warning of the police visits , saying it " would cause serious concerns from our members			1
" the emailed alert , copies of which were provided to @entity1 , raise particular concerns for international businesses operating in @entity4 because many companies often use private networks that allow employees to skirt @entity4 's so - called " @entity30 " of censors			2
but , based on the @entity13 alert , it appears firms in some areas are being asked to install a device within their private systems to track all internet activity -- and that information must be made available to police , looking for " illegal activity			1
" " it has come to our attention that three of our @entity13 members reported that local police units in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 approached them , forcing two members to purchase internet security software from the police designated suppliers , " wrote @entity42 , chairman of the @entity13 membership services committee , in the email obtained by @entity1			1
" reportedly , if they failed to do so , the police threatened to cut off their internet connection and fine them			2
" another @entity13 member company received a questionnaire from the local police unit asking about its internet security measures , according to the @entity13 email			2
" given that if the local @entity66 ( public security bureau ) initiative were carried forward , it would cause serious concerns from our members , we are attempting to determine if any of our other 200 - plus member companies have faced this same situation or know other member companies who have , " @entity42 wrote			0
