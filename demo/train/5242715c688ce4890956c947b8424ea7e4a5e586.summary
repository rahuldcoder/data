-- @entity2 's professional wrestling career did n't end with a pink slip or a celebratory sendoff , but with a swift kick to his chin			1
@entity2 was a @entity7 wrestler when he suffered a concussion , but did n't realize how badly he was hurt			1
@entity2 played college football at @entity10 -- a defensive tackle			1
he was a promising newcomer to @entity7			0
at the time he suffered the injury -- the hit that would cut his career short -- he was performing in a summer 2003 tag - team match as his @entity7 character , @entity2 , a blonde , blue - eyed symbol of @entity18 elitism			1
@entity2 did n't know he had suffered a concussion			1
he did n't know that he should n't have been wrestling immediately afterward , and he did n't know that this was probably the sixth concussion of his athletic career			0
there was a lot @entity2 did n't know about concussions			1
hard hits were nothing new to @entity2 , 28 , a tree of a man who had played sports since childhood			1
blows to the head punctuated many of the games and matches in his career , he said			0
" the sky would change colors , or i would see stars , and get really dizzy , and i would just collect myself on the field or in the ring , and continue going , because that 's what i thought i was supposed to do , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			0
" i did n't realize that it was a serious brain injury			0
" @entity2 continued to wrestle , which aggravated the injury , he said			1
he developed post-concussion syndrome , a condition characterized by prolonged concussion symptoms			0
" after my last concussion ... i was stuck with four years of headaches and immediate memory problems and depression and sleep - walking , " @entity2 said			1
he said he still endures migraines and memory loss			0
" my head just feels differently all the time , " he said			0
concussions are common , particularly among athletes in heavy contact sports			1
the @entity59 estimates that at least 300,000 sports - related concussions occur annually in the @entity61			2
@entity2 waited a year and a half for his head to clear so he could return to the ring -- a day that never came			1
so , the fallen wrestler decided to change what he considers the sports world 's biggest liability			0
he 's now on a mission to eliminate the " damage " from head injuries in athletics			0
his task is two-fold : to educate coaches , parents and athletes about identifying and treating concussions and to help facilitate research to pin down the injury 's long - term effects			1
" i knew i had the information that could prevent suffering for a lot of people , a lot of people that i cared about , " said @entity2			1
" it would n't have been right for me to just go on with my life , make money , do whatever , while that information just sat in my head			0
" he wrote " head games : football 's @entity93 from the @entity95 to @entity96 , " published in 2006			1
he 's been speaking before youth leagues , sports conferences and other public events for more than three years			0
and he and a group of top neurologists have recently formed @entity102			0
part of that organization 's purpose will be to study the effects of multiple head injuries , investigating cases of a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity111 , @entity2 said			1
@entity111 is a dementia - like condition caused by repetitive blows to the head over an extended period of time , according to the @entity117			0
hoping to prove to the rest of the world that multiple concussions have permanent , sometimes ruinous consequences , @entity2 began to work with a @entity123 neuropathologist , dr. @entity122 , who found the condition in the brains of two deceased former @entity95 players , @entity127 and @entity128			1
with @entity2 's help in obtaining the brain tissue , @entity122 diagnosed the condition in two other former players who died , @entity133 and @entity134			1
both @entity127 and @entity133 committed suicide			0
in the case of @entity133 , @entity122 said , " major depression was the cause of his suicide ... and the underlying causation here was trauma			0
" but aside from the research and studies that garner headlines and national attention , a large part of @entity2 's task lies in his clear - spoken testimony			2
in smaller groups , in schools and other events , often away from the stare of the cameras , @entity2 tells people what he knows			2
despite the repeated occurrence of concussions amid practice , games or matches , @entity2 says many coaches and players -- from youth leagues to professionals - still do n't know how to properly treat concussions or even how to identify them			1
and what 's worse , he said , just like in his case , athletes often try to play while they are still injured			2
a second concussion suffered while a player is recovering from the first could result in death , according to the @entity173			0
furthermore , some studies show that there are cumulative long - term effects from multiple concussions			2
@entity178 says he 's had mixed reactions to his message			0
some , like @entity181 , president of the @entity184 , @entity185 - based @entity183 football program , say @entity2 's lecture is imperative for coaches			1
" bottom line , if they care about kids , they should listen to this lecture , " @entity188 said			0
others have shown more resistance			0
" i [ 'll ] go to schools to speak , and the football coach will refuse to show up to the talk , " @entity2 said			1
but the former wrestler says the biggest hurdle to better practice and treatment of concussions are the professional sports leagues			2
he is particularly critical of the @entity95			2
" they need their best players on the field to sell tickets , " @entity2 said			1
" and a lot of these problems from playing through concussions do n't show up until these guys are retired			2
so their incentive to protect them while they 're players is not where it should be			2
" @entity95 commissioner @entity220 says the league puts its players ' interests as first priority and the individual teams " do an excellent job in the care and management of concussions that affect @entity95 players			1
" dr. @entity231 , the neurosurgeon for the @entity232 and a member of the league 's committee on mild - traumatic brain injury , applauds the @entity95 's efforts to protect its players			1
asked about studies that suggest long - term damage from concussions , @entity239 said there are other factors that could affect the ability of a person 's brain to function normally			2
" it 's extremely difficult and quite impossible to ascribe problems that develop 20 or 30 years after someone played to a concussion that 's experienced 20 or 30 years before , " he said			2
@entity2 said players still do not understand the seriousness of concussions			1
they need to be educated , he said , and the " tough - it - out " culture inherent to football and other sports needs to change			0
" if within a few years , everybody does n't know that playing through concussions is a terrible idea , then i 'll be surprised and disappointed , " he said			0
" the idea is we make the change that needs to be made as quickly as possible , " @entity2 said			2
" and then i can do something else			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity2 played football at @entity10 , then wrestled professionally
still suffers effects of six concussions
@entity2 says athletes ignore *dangers* to get back in *contests*
@entity95 says it is taking steps to study effects on players
