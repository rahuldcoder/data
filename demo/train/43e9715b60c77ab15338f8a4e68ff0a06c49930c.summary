-- almost everyone knows that each @entity2 has its own flag			2
state flags , however , are just the most visible elements of an elaborate , esoteric system of legalized symbols that characterize and codify our united states			2
it 's time we were all exposed to the bizarre symbology of state identity - politics			1
@entity15 ' state flower , the bluebonnet , is celebrated in the @entity15 state song			2
to begin with , some of the most well - known state symbols allude to lesser - known meanings and histories			1
i grew up in @entity23 and only recently learned that the @entity23 title originally refers not to @entity25 , nor to the savage beast itself , but to lead miners in the 1820s and 30s			1
these miners moved from prospect to prospect in southwestern @entity23 , traveling light and often , with little money for luxury			1
when winter came and conditions worsened , those miners too far from home to migrate would dig themselves sheltering caves in the hills -- like badgers			1
these temporary dwellings could be abandoned if a prospect proved fruitless , without much regret ; and if the lead pickings were good , the lucky miner could fluff up his badger hole or upgrade to a more traditional @entity51 residence			0
for this practice @entity23 miners were dubbed " badgers " -- a jibe that was soon appropriated as a proud , statewide nickname			1
@entity25 did n't come along until 1949 ; the furry , quadruped badger , notoriously vicious when cornered , was n't declared @entity23 's state animal until 1957			1
other miners migrated south for the winter to the far end of @entity63 , much like the region 's sucker fish ; which earned them the nickname of @entity68 , and their state of @entity63 its unenviable nickname , @entity71			1
@entity0 : how 22 colleges got their nicknames ' rebel ' woodpecker the state bird of @entity76 has another tale behind it			1
they honor a little woodpecker they call the yellowhammer , which is known outside of @entity76 as the northern flicker , the common flicker , or simply @entity85			1
( it eats a lot of ants , and is not to be confused with the yellowhammer bunting of @entity90 and @entity91			0
) state birds are chosen for reasons many and varied , some meaningful and others frivolous -- from the pretty songs they sing to their proximity to extinction -- and i believe this is the only bird singled out for its resemblance to @entity102 uniforms			1
the story goes that a clean , trim , flashy bunch of new @entity102 recruits one day passed by a weary , bedraggled , dusty pod of veterans , and their fresh uniforms , grey tinged with brilliant yellow , reminded some jokester vet of the woodpecker , so he let out a mocking call : " @entity114 , yallerhammer , flicker , flicker ! " the jeer stuck , and the recruits were soon labeled the @entity118			1
later , as these things go , all @entity76 troops were known as @entity121 , the whole state as the @entity76 , and @entity102 veterans developed a habit of wearing yellow feathers in their caps and lapels to dress up for post-war reunions			1
but the real fun starts when these state symbols more shamelessly approach the ridiculous			2
let us consider some of the finest specimens : eat and drink to the honor of the state most states have at least one form of official food			2
in @entity139 , the official doughnut is the beignet			0
( i 'm unaware of any other state doughnuts -- and i 'm disappointed			1
) @entity144 's official muffin is made with apples ; @entity146 's with blueberries ; and none have yet found it fit to honor the vegan bran and raisin muffin , despite whatever strange wonders it works on the abdominal tubing			2
@entity153 is the only state with an official flavor : maple , as in maple syrup -- but because they 've designated the " flavor , " not the " syrup , " we can assume the appointment includes everything from maple - glaze for ham to autumnal maple lattes			1
shockingly , @entity166 has recognized a complete ( and daunting ) meal : fried okra , squash , cornbread , barbeque pork , biscuits , sausage and gravy , grits , corn , chicken friend steak , black - eyed peas , strawberries , and pecan pies			2
@entity0 : 6 food challenges for the super hungry as for state drinks , @entity182 has @entity184 , @entity185 has water ( hubris ! ) , and @entity76 , the standout , has @entity189 -- a re-creation of some well - regarded illegal moonshine made in the backwoods by a man named @entity194 may			1
silly , sentimental , and insulting songs all states have songs , too , except @entity198			0
most states have more than one			0
there are state ballads , state marches , state waltzes , and so on			2
@entity205 has a state cantata ( a narrative piece intermixed with solos and choruses ) ; @entity139 has a state environmental song ( " @entity211 " ) ; @entity212 a polka ( " @entity214 from @entity212 " ) ; a couple states have lullabies ; and @entity217 has an official rock song , " hang on sloopy			1
" two state anthems , @entity221 's and @entity222 's , are set to the familiar tune of " @entity224 ! " , or " @entity224 ! " ; but no states have designated official @entity227 songs			1
and despite @entity15 ' tough boy image ( their official footwear is the cowboy boot ) , it 's the only state with an official flower song -- in praise of its state flower , the bluebonnet			1
many of the traditional states songs are brazenly effusive			0
@entity239 's begins , " i love you , @entity239 , " and continues , rather romantically , " you 're the magic in me			0
" @entity241 's is similar , without the magic : " i love you , @entity241 , you 're the greatest state of all			1
" @entity245 use the superlative when singing to " the state we love the best			0
" usually they 're just hilarious , but a few of these songs bear some heinously outdated lyrics			0
with a nod to the old @entity255 , @entity253 praises its women as @entity257 , " so graceful , so constant , yet to gentlest breath trembling			0
" the real trouble comes , though , with old minstrel tunes that portray humble " darkies " praising " old @entity264 " in song and romanticizing their cotton - picking servitude			0
@entity266 changed the language for " @entity268 " in 1986 to glaze over such indiscretions			0
but @entity270 still seems to have trouble acknowledging its error , and simply demoted its song , " @entity274 , " to the status of " state song emeritus			0
" @entity270 still seeks an adequate replacement , preferably one that does n't idealize slavery			0
every state for itself besides these strange variations on common themes , many states have even more idiosyncratic symbols			0
since 1962 , the official sport of @entity221 has been jousting , and more recently , the state 's official " exercise " was declared to be walking			2
not even mall - walking or speed - walking -- just " walking			2
" @entity266 does n't have a " sport , " but it does have an official tug - of - war : the @entity290			0
@entity292 has a state toy , the teddy bear ; @entity212 a state bean , the navy bean ; and @entity166 proudly boasts the only state cartoon character , a gust of wind named @entity300 that was used to report weather and news , between 1954 and 1989			1
@entity0 : state nickname quiz while many designations seem absurd , most aim to represent some definite aspect of a state 's intended " character			2
" legislators want icons that mean something , that give you a sense of the land and its people -- something like the bolo tie			0
@entity239 named the bolo tie its official neckwear back in 1971			0
and more recently , in 2007 , @entity319 added the same to its list of emblems			0
apparently , it was an @entity239 silversmith who invented the string - and - buckle necktie when he took off his hatband to avoid losing the precious buckle during a high - wind horse ride , and hung it around his neck			0
this discovery occurred as late as 1940 , but the bolo 's become such an icon that it 's hard to imagine a @entity333 without it			0
