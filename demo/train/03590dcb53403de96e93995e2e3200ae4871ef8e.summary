-- president @entity1 knows we live in a two - tiered @entity3			1
in july , the president , who is himself an example of how anyone can or should be able make it in the @entity7 , went on the road to make the point over and over again that the nation 's widening gap between rich and poor is tearing at the very fabric of society			1
" even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits , " the president said in prepared remarks delivered in @entity15 , " nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 %			0
" " i will seize any opportunity i can find , " he told the @entity20 later that month , " to work with @entity22 to strengthen the middle class , improve their prospects , improve their security			0
" any opportunity ? ok , then			0
here 's one : how about paying your interns ? as @entity33 , a former unpaid @entity32 intern herself , reports for @entity35 , the @entity32 is coming under pressure from groups like the @entity38 to pay the college students who work 9 - to - 6 jobs ( at least ) for no money			1
@entity33 told me it cost her " a couple thousand dollars " to take a @entity32 internship in 2010			1
" think about it , " she said			0
" you 're there for three months			2
you 're relocating to a new city			2
you have to pay rent			0
you have to pay transportation costs to and from the @entity32			1
" plus : she had to buy a suit			0
ca n't afford an internship ? try asking for donations " you have to be able to afford to be a @entity32 intern			1
" maybe intern pay and the health of the middle class , on first glance , seem unrelated			0
i saw a few tweets saying it 's no big thing that the @entity32 does n't pay interns			1
" no. it 's called ' paying your dues , ' " one woman wrote			2
" give school credit or something ! " but internships are an important ( maybe essential ) part of the modern @entity74 ©			2
without one , it 's difficult to find some of the most desirable and high - paying jobs			1
@entity33 , for example , said her @entity32 internship has come up in pretty much every job interview she 's done			1
and she says it probably got her into graduate school			0
potential interns who ca n't cough up thousands of dollars in living expenses are left out of the mix , or have a much harder time making the situation livable , meaning the best internships and the best jobs are more likely to go to the upper middle class and rich			1
it 's just one of many ways middle - class and poor @entity3 are being left behind in the age of income inequality			1
the system seems rigged to ensure that wealthier @entity3 have a much better chance at success than their poorer counterparts			1
there are always great rags - to - riches examples that defy this trend			2
our pop culture eats that stuff up			0
but statistics paint a more sobering picture : only 9.5 % of kids born into the bottom income quintile in @entity109 will rise to the top fifth of earners , according to a recent study from @entity113 and the @entity114			0
the numbers are even worse in cities like @entity117 and @entity118			0
with college expenses skyrocketing and internships offering young workers little or no compensation , it 's no wonder it 's becoming more difficult to climb out of poverty and into the middle class			1
" when the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart , it undermines the very essence of @entity3			1
" yep , that 's @entity1 , again			2
the @entity32 is n't alone in offering an unpaid internship program -- and internships are far from being responsible for @entity3 's gap between rich and poor			1
opinion : you do n't have to be an unpaid intern ( @entity0 , for those who are wondering , does pay its interns )			2
but the executive branch could use this opportunity to make a statement about equality of opportunity in @entity3 by offering paid internships , as many others do			1
not everybody can be like @entity147 , which , according to the site @entity149 , pays some interns $ 6,800 per month			0
but look at the news site @entity152 , which made headlines when it started a @entity155 page to raise $ 22,000 to hire an intern to write stories about internships			0
there are ways to make this work financially			0
meanwhile , the @entity38 is right to point out the hypocrisy of the @entity163 lobbying for a higher minimum wage while paying some of its young workers nothing at all			0
the president can set an important example on this			0
hard work should be rewarded with fair pay			0
and the playing field for new workers should be as level as possible			0
otherwise , we 're just encouraging the rich - poor gap to grow			1
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity178 .			2

@entity35 reports interns at the @entity32 are unpaid
@entity182 : unpaid internships contribute @entity3 's rich - poor gap
he says the @entity32 should set a better example for other *employers*
@entity178 : " *...* we 're just encouraging the rich - poor gap to grow "
