-- the ability to share images and thoughts instantly is one of the marvels of the @entity6			1
most of us , thanks to @entity10 , have a relationship to a social network that involves a stream of conversation ( albeit often banal : " i 'm making chicken			1
... " really ? ) but more than conversation , our profiles usually include photos and sometimes @entity21 video sharing -- and not just ones of @entity22 sounding off , but also home movies of little @entity25 's ballet recital or @entity27 's first ski run			1
much has been publicized about how important it is for parents to monitor their kids ' use of technology , but what are the guidelines for parents of small children ? when children are not old enough to read , write , talk or press " upload , " is it inappropriate for us to post their photos on the @entity42 ? as usual , i am of two minds			1
i love staying connected to friends , and will occasionally post photos on @entity10 , but i rarely put my kids ' photos on the @entity42 or my blog			1
yet , i notice a lot of blogs seem to be nothing but family photos			1
also , i am not sure why i draw a distinction , especially when @entity10 has been under scrutiny about its privacy policies			0
then , i wondered , what about allowing your kids to be on tv ? or in print ? is there a difference ? is there an actual danger in having their images out there ? i decided to poll some parents to hear their views			1
a 42 - year - old mother of three , who wanted to preserve her family 's privacy , not surprisingly does not even have a @entity10 page			1
she said , " i feel like @entity10 is so voyeuristic and putting my children 's photos on there is me making a decision for them when it can affect them for the rest of their lives			1
i put my photos on @entity85 and send my family the link that way			1
" i asked her if she felt posting photos on @entity10 was a real danger to her kids , and she said she believed , " it could be , but to me , it is more of an ethical decision			1
" @entity96 , mother of two , has no issue having her kids ' photos on the @entity42			1
even her personal profile photo on @entity10 is a family shot			0
she also posts individual photos of them on her @entity10 page			1
when i asked her if she thinks this could pose a threat to her kids , she said , " no i do n't			2
maybe i am ignorant , but i do n't worry about it			0
" she also went on to say that she likes to think people are good			0
then she added , " then again , our house did get broken into two weeks ago			0
" ( she was not relating this to her @entity10 practices , but instead acknowledging she was an optimist when characterizing humanity			0
) she also did n't believe it was a big deal to have her kids posted on @entity21			2
@entity118 , on the other hand , father of two , is " creeped , " out by having his kids ' images on @entity10 or the @entity42 , yet his wife , @entity121 , does use @entity10 to keep in touch with their family miles away			1
she said , " as long as you use your privacy settings , and ( have ) location services shut off , i do n't have a huge problem with it			0
" i wondered what i would hear from people who were high profile or had a bit of celebrity standing			0
i talked to mom blogger @entity134 , who has a large @entity136 following			2
she never posts photos of her kids on the @entity42			1
she believes her " children are entitled to make their own first impression			2
" being their friend on @entity10 takes this opportunity away			0
she also said she feels , " @entity143 blogs are @entity144 for pedophiles			1
" a mid- 30s father of two is shooting a reality television show about his company and his family life			0
( he is not permitted to discuss specifics about the show until it airs			0
) when asked how he felt about having his kids be part of a tv show , he said , " at first we ( he and his wife ) were against it			2
" he noted there are some reality tv shows in which he feels the kids are exploited ; cameras follow kids around all day and the kids are used as trophies			2
he feels he and his wife are making a show that realistically portrays the juggle of balancing family and work , and will shed insights on that struggle			2
the show he is involved in is not about the kids , so he has let go of his misgivings about it			2
so , some parents think it is no big deal , some feel it is dangerous			2
how about the experts ? what 's their take ? i spoke with @entity184 , national safety director for the @entity185			2
she would like parents to be aware that posting their kids ' photos online does pose " a potential risk			1
" she added she does not want people to be unduly alarmed , but urges parents , " make sure only trusted people in their lives have access to your photos			1
" in a statement on the @entity185 's resource guide , the advice is : " there is no particular way to prevent your uploaded images from being copied , saved and used by other individuals online			1
the only way to ensure that no one is using and saving your images is to avoid uploading them to the @entity136			2
" i spoke with @entity210 , child advocate and founder of @entity212 , an organization in @entity214 , @entity215 , dedicated to children 's safety			1
i asked about @entity10 , specifically			0
she said , " i have not heard of any parents with young children being stalked because they saw pictures of kids on someone 's facebook page			1
" still , she urged caution , adding , " it is very easy for information to wind up in the wrong hands			0
" she said it is far more common " for tweens to create a @entity10 page , lie about their age , post provocative photos and profiles that are not private , tag their names and very easily become accessible			0
" we all have various degrees of comfort when it comes to privacy on the @entity136 , as we do in the other parts of our lives			0
we have different lenses through which we view the world , and styles from which we parent			0
some people are afraid of flying , others of terrorist attacks			0
some are able to , or chose to , live without fear			0
my friend @entity251 , who is afraid of many things , is not afraid of flying			0
his theory is , if the plane goes down , it 's not his fault			0
but , if our responsibility as parents is to protect our kids , then we need to be conscious of the fact that the @entity42 is a public forum			1
we need to remember that like innocence lost , once you post it , you can never get it back			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity269 .			0
