@entity0 -- @entity2 was rushed to the hospital as @entity4 was carving its way through @entity6 on august 25 , 2005			1
she could n't breathe and she was seven months pregnant			2
doctors told her she had an enlarged heart and needed an emergency cesarean section or @entity11 and her baby would die			1
@entity13 was born weighing 2 pounds , 11 ounces			2
but @entity14 slipped into a medically induced coma and was put on a ventilator inside @entity17 in east @entity18 , @entity19 , not far from the city 's @entity20			1
read about another mother 's separation story as she lay in the coma , @entity4 became a monster storm and the pleas for @entity18 residents to evacuate got louder			1
@entity28 decided he and his wife 's four other children would drive to @entity0 , @entity31 for a few days			1
" i left a picture of @entity13 on her chest and kissed her goodbye			2
i thought we 'd be back in a few days , " @entity28 said			2
three days later , @entity14 emerged from the coma , but she was alone			2
on august 28 , 2005 , then - @entity18 mayor @entity38 issued a mandatory evacuation of the city			1
nurses told @entity11 her premature newborn was taken to another hospital for better care			1
this was the beginning of @entity14 's @entity4 ordeal , a separation that would take months to overcome			1
" when i woke up they said the storm was coming , but it was sunny outside , " said @entity11			1
" i could n't imagine how serious it was			2
" the next part of the story is well documented			2
the storm came , the levees broke and @entity18 flooded			1
the bottom floors of @entity17 filled with water			2
there was no escape for @entity11 and hundreds of other patients			1
" it was horrific ; it was chaotic			2
it was something out of a horror movie , " she said			2
the scene inside @entity17 deteriorated with every passing hour			0
without power , patients on ventilators were dying			0
doctors and nurses were using their hands to keep the ventilator pumps going and patients alive			0
food and water was dwindling			0
" i thought i was going to die , " @entity11 said			1
" it was pitch dark and it was really scary			0
" and in the midst of all this , @entity11 could n't stop thinking about her baby boy			1
she had n't even had a chance to hold him or call him by his new name , @entity13			0
she 'd been told that @entity13 was taken to @entity88			0
but if her world was collapsing what was happening to @entity13 , she thought to herself			0
as more time passed she feared the worst			0
" i thought @entity13 was dead already , " @entity11 said			1
" i thought who in the world is going to keep up with a 2 - pound baby during times like this			0
" two days after the storm , helicopters started landing on the rooftop of @entity17 to evacuate patients			2
@entity11 says she was airlifted and dropped off on a bridge on the western edge of @entity18			1
she spent the next 18 hours sitting under a bridge , still recovering from the delivery , waiting for help			0
@entity2 says , " a nurse told me she did n't think i was going to make it			1
" @entity108 was taking its toll			0
on september 1 help arrived in the form of a bus ride to the @entity18 airport and a seat on an airplane out of town			1
when she arrived at the airport , i was there reporting on the evacuation efforts			0
@entity11 was in a line of female patients evacuated from the @entity17 maternity ward			1
all the other mothers had newborn babies in their arms , @entity14 was only holding @entity127 pictures of @entity13			0
she approached me and said , " i do n't know where my baby is			0
i 'm looking for my baby			0
" it was a rushed interview , the moment so chaotic that i only had time to get a few basic facts			0
but moments later we broadcast her story , and @entity11 and the picture of her baby boy were loaded onto a plane bound for @entity138			1
" all they told us is you need to get out of the city			0
i did n't want to leave the city without knowing where my baby was ; i just thought that was weird , " @entity11 said			1
a friend of @entity11 saw the interview and relayed word to her husband , who had now gone six days without hearing a word about his wife and baby			1
but when @entity28 finally tracked down his wife in a @entity153 shelter in @entity154 , @entity138 , the most important part of the story was n't passed along accurately			0
" i thought @entity13 was with her and when i first saw her she told me ' i do n't know where the baby is ' and that 's when my heart sank , " said @entity28			0
aid workers and caregivers heard @entity11 's story and started making an intense round of phone calls			1
in a september 14 , 2005 , posting on the website of @entity172 rep. @entity171 of @entity154 , the congressman 's staff detailed the efforts to track down @entity13			0
" @entity13 had traveled to three different hospitals during the hectic evacuation , " according to the congressman 's website			0
" after 24 hours of searching ... " @entity179 " had been located at @entity178			0
the moments that followed were priceless -- tears of joy followed by laughter			0
" the family tried to return to @entity18 , the city both @entity2 and @entity28 had always called home			1
they returned four months after @entity4 to find their home destroyed by the floodwaters			1
they moved into a @entity193 trailer but for a family of seven it proved too difficult			2
" going back to a city that needed to be rebuilt was just too much for the kids , leaving @entity18 was really hard , " said @entity2			1
in @entity0 , @entity31 , the @entity11 family is flourishing			1
@entity13 is healthy and 5 years old			0

@entity28 is a full - time pastor of @entity203 at @entity0			0
@entity14 also started a foundation helping @entity4 evacuees called " @entity206			1
" the organization helps @entity4 survivors find homes , rental assistance and offers financial planning			1
" life is better now , " says @entity2			2
" what @entity4 did for me was a wake - up call ; it made me start to live my life in a better way			2
