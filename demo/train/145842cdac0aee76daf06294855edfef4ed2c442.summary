@entity0 , @entity1 -- i stopped on a recent night in front of the palace of the @entity1 president			1
i had no choice : the crowd stood so thick that i could not move			0
we were hemmed between the buildings on one side of the sidewalk and a police barrier on the other			0
the wide pavement between was obstructed by gawkers watching a strange performance : a weird seemingly incomprehensible little passion play of stereotyped figures			0
what the hell is this ? i asked an onlooker wedged against me			0
he answered , but in @entity1 , leaving me no wiser			1
i had stumbled across the summer 's big political conflict in @entity1 : the site of a wooden cross placed to commemorate the accidental death of @entity27 , the former president of @entity1 killed in an air crash near @entity29 in april			1
admirers of the president had laid the cross at the gates of the presidential residence as a symbol of mourning			1
in the same spirit , admirers of princess @entity38 laid flowers at the gate of @entity42 in @entity43			2
but while flowers disintegrate after an interval , wooden crosses do not			2
the cross stayed in place for weeks			1
supporters lit candles , said prayers			0
you might expect the crowds to thin as time passed			0
feelings for -- and against -- have flared and intensified the battle over a cross that has come to symbolize the divisions in @entity1 society			1
@entity27 was not a universally admired figure			2
@entity62 , urban @entity63 , highly educated @entity63 tended to perceive @entity27 as rustic , embarrassing			2
older @entity63 , rural @entity1 , tradition - minded @entity63 were @entity27 's constituency			1
like them , @entity27 upheld traditional @entity67 beliefs and mistrusted free - market economic reforms			1
@entity27 's death confirmed both his supporters and his detractors ' views			1
supporters saw a @entity1 patriot flying to @entity29 to pay tribute to the 22,000 @entity1 officers murdered in the @entity77 in 1940 -- and to extract from @entity79 belated acknowledgement of its crime			1
detractors saw an egomaniac trying to upstage his own prime minister , who had made the same trip for the same purpose three days earlier			0
they quietly suspect @entity27 pressured his pilot to disregard air traffic control and proceed with a landing in unsafe conditions , resulting in the deaths of 95 others			2
supporters have increasingly represented @entity27 as a martyr , a victim of a mysterious conspiracy organized by the @entity79 , the @entity99 , who knows who ? detractors are disgusted by the conspiracy theories -- and increasingly impatient with accolades to a president they quietly regard as deeply third - rate			1
at the beginning of august , @entity1 's newly elected president , @entity108 , proposed a compromise			1
the cross would be removed from the presidential residence and displayed instead in nearby @entity113 , one of the capital 's most famous monuments			2
at the original site of the cross , a commemorative plaque would be placed in the pavement			0
on august 3 , more than 1,000 protesters forcibly prevented the removal of the cross			0
cross opponents have now begun to stage counter-protests			0
the opponents have begun to perceive in the cross agitation an attempt to impose a sectarian identity on a state that -- while overwhelmingly catholic in belief -- is secular in law			0
" crosses belong in church , not at the gate of the presidential palace , " one cross opponent told me			0
they see the crowds surrounding the cross as the embryo of a reactionary , xenophobic political movement : a repudiation of 20 years of effort to build a modern , dynamic , @entity147 @entity1			1
but @entity148 @entity63 see the dismissal of the cross as a dismissal of them			0
not all @entity63 speak @entity153 or @entity154 , not all @entity63 use a computer or work for international companies			0
many @entity63 were born slightly too early to benefit from post-communist opportunities : for them , the end of communism meant only the end of a job at a steel mill or a coal mine or a collective farm			0
they know that city sophisticates disparaged @entity27 as crude and ignorant			2
they darkly suspect that these upwardly mobile @entity63 hold an equally negative opinion of their less successful compatriots			0
as one @entity27 supporter told the @entity174 : the cross " is a reminder that there was a president here who suffered , who was made fun of			1
" if you catch echoes here of what @entity185 has meant to some of her supporters , it 's probably not a coincidence : a politician disdained by society 's smarty - pants - and who redeployed that disdain to gain the support of those who feel disdained themselves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

a wooden cross dedicated to late president @entity27 has prompted division in @entity1
@entity200 says supporters of keeping cross in place favor more traditional values
he says those in favor of moving cross support *dramatic* *improvements* in @entity1 economy
@entity27 's admirers think he was not valued by the elites , @entity200 says , much like @entity185
