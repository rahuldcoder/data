@entity0 -- gen. @entity2 on wednesday issued a new " tactical directive " for forces in @entity5 that emphasizes guidance for the use of force by troops operating in the country			1
" we must continue -- indeed , redouble -- our efforts to reduce the loss of innocent civilian life to an absolute minimum , " the directive states in part			1
" every @entity5 civilian death diminishes our cause			0
if we use excessive force or operate contrary to our counterinsurgency principles , tactical victories may prove to be strategic setbacks			2
" the directive states that before firing , the commander authorizing a strike must determine that there are no civilians present			2
if the status of civilians is unknown , firing is prohibited except when certain types of risk to troops exist			2
in another unclassified portion of the document , @entity2 states , " protecting the @entity5 people does require killing , capturing , or turning the insurgents			1
indeed , as i noted earlier , we must pursue the @entity38 tenaciously			0
but we must fight with great discipline and tactical patience			2
" according to the directive , some civilian casualties result from misunderstandings or ignorance of local customs or behaviors			2
to reduce that , @entity47 forces partner with @entity5 troops in their operations			2
@entity2 stressed the importance of these partnerships , saying that he expects every operation and patrol to be partnered			1
" ( @entity5 troop 's ) presence will ensure greater situational awareness			0
it will also serve to alleviate anxiety on the part of the local population and build confidence in @entity5 security forces , " the directive states			2
most of the directive is classified			2
@entity69 and coalition military officials told @entity1 that that @entity2 was not expected to reverse existing directives issued by the previous commander , gen. @entity71 , but instead characterized the new directive as a clarification of the rules he put into place emphasizing protection of civilians on the battlefield			1
the directive does that by spelling out more clearly under what circumstances units must get permission to launch attacks to defend themselves			1
troops were awaiting the directive with some anticipation			1
some troops on the ground complained about the @entity71 directives , saying they unduly hampered troops from defending themselves in favor of protecting civilian populations			1
those @entity71 directives limited the use of airstrikes , night raids and other firepower against civilians			0
in wednesday 's directive , @entity2 notes that this order , as with the previous directive , does not prevent use of force in self - defense			1
at his confirmation hearing last month to take command in @entity5 , @entity2 explained a tactical directive is " designed to guide the employment , in particular , of large casualty - producing devices , bombs , close air support , attack helicopters , and so forth			1
" the concern , however , is that implementation has been uneven , leading some units to be overly restrictive			0
" we have to be absolutely certain that the implementation of the tactical directive and the rules of engagement is even throughout the force , " @entity2 said , " that there are not leaders at certain levels that are perhaps making this more bureaucratic or more restrictive than necessary when our troops and our @entity5 partners are in a tough spot			1
and when they are in a tough spot , it 's a moral imperative that we use everything we have to ensure that they get out of it			0
" @entity2 made clear he is aware of the troop 's worries			1
" i am keenly aware of concerns by some of our troopers on the ground about the application of our rules of engagement and the tactical directive			1
they should know that i will look very hard at this issue			0
" on sunday , @entity2 issued a more general , public list of guidelines for counterinsurgency warfare in which he urged @entity69 troops and the @entity47 - led @entity151 to learn and adapt to the culture of @entity5 while battling the @entity38 insurgents and their allies			1
while @entity2 called on the troops to " pursue the enemy relentlessly " and " seek out and eliminate " insurgents who threaten @entity5 civilians , he also urged coalition forces to fight " with discipline " and be careful to avoid civilian casualties			1
@entity2 ' directive comes shortly after the @entity38 released its own directive late last month			1
that directive , from @entity165 , called for insurgents to avoid harming civilians			0
in a news release wednesday , the @entity151 said that despite @entity165 's call , 43 @entity5 civilians have been killed and 65 injured by insurgents since the directive came out			0
the casualties included five children who were killed in @entity173 on monday by a suicide bomber , @entity151 said			0
others were killed by improvised explosive devices			0
" @entity165 's new directive has done nothing to protect the @entity5 people from further harm , " said @entity177			0
gen. @entity182 , @entity151 spokesman			0
" this is either a smokescreen to repair the @entity38 's well - earned reputation for brutality , or insurgent groups are simply ignoring their leader			0
in either event , the @entity5 people will continue to suffer from oppression and indiscriminate violence until the insurgents are defeated			0
" @entity1 's @entity193 contributed to this report .			0
