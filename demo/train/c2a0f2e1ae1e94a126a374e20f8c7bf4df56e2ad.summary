@entity0 , @entity1 -- as political comebacks go , @entity3 's is among the more remarkable			1
he served two terms as @entity1 's prime minister in the 1990s before he was overthrown in a military coup and banished into the political hinterlands			1
after a @entity1 court sentenced him to life in prison for hijacking and terrorism , he managed to negotiate his way into exile in @entity16 , where he remained for seven years , waiting for the political tides to shift and allow his return			2
on wednesday , he completed his long journey back to power and became prime minister for an unprecedented third term			1
the @entity23 , where his political party secured control in elections last month , elected him prime minister with 244 votes			1
later wednesday , he took the oath of office from president @entity31 , one of his longtime political rivals whose term ends later this year			1
@entity31 's @entity34 ( @entity34 ) had been in government since 2008			0
this year , it became the first elected administration in the country 's history to successfully see out a full term in office and hand over power democratically			0
but that milestone did n't help the @entity34 at the ballot box last month			0
following a term plagued by corruption allegations , militant violence , economic torpor and power shortages , its support fell away in an election marred by extremist attacks on candidates			0
@entity3 's @entity55 , on the other hand , performed strongly , capitalizing on his image as a flag - bearer for private industry and entrepreneurship with promises to revive the country 's economic fortunes			1
@entity63 challenges now , as he takes the reins of government again , he will have to face up to @entity1 's raft of daunting challenges			2
his economic stewardship will be quickly put to the test			0
analysts say @entity3 , the scion of an industrial family and one of the country 's richest people , has typically favored large , showy infrastructure projects such as highways as a way to spur economic activity			1
but with @entity1 's public finances in a fragile state , finding the funds for big building plans could prove difficult , observers say			0
he also has the complex task of resolving the country 's energy crisis , which has resulted in prolonged power outages that hurt businesses and sometimes provoke street protests			0
the security situation in the country remains a severe problem , as the widespread attacks during the elections by the @entity1 @entity95 and other extremists showed			2
@entity3 has floated the idea of holding talks with the @entity95 , but some analysts say the country 's powerful military , with whom @entity3 has clashed in the past , will hold the final word on key security and foreign policy decisions			1
stance on drones ? until wednesday , when he called for an end to drone strikes , his stance on the @entity109 ' unpopular program in @entity1 's tribal areas that border @entity111 was unclear			0
" the campaign of drone strikes should be shut down , " @entity3 said in his acceptance speech			2
" we must work together to ensure @entity1 's sovereignty			0
" @entity119 , the former cricket star whose young party has become one of the main opposition groups in parliament , has called on @entity3 to bring an end to the @entity109 program			1
@entity3 has condemned drone strikes in the past , including the one last week that killed the @entity1 @entity95 's no. 2 leader			1
but analysts say he had good working relations with the @entity109 during his previous terms in office and is likely to take a similarly pragmatic approach once back in power			2
he has said he will pursue closer ties with @entity1 's neighbor and archrival , @entity138			0
during his second term as prime minister , in the late 1990s , @entity3 oversaw @entity1 's emergence as a nuclear power , for which many @entity1 still hold him in high regard			1
it remains to be seen what his third term will be remembered for			0
@entity2 's @entity147 reported from @entity0 , and @entity148 reported and wrote from @entity149 .			0

@entity3 is *sworn* in as prime minister wednesday
he held office twice in the 1990s , but was overthrown in a military coup
he returned from exile in 2007 and his party won elections last month
analysts say he faces a raft of *thorny* challenges , including security and the economy
