@entity0 -- americans can expect a roaring debate over social issues in the discussion of the next @entity8 nominee , but in the end , president @entity10 's choice to succeed justice @entity11 is likely to be confirmed , @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity2 says			1
@entity2 , author of " @entity13 : inside the @entity19 of the @entity8 , " said the large @entity15 majority in the @entity16 gives @entity10 a strong chance of getting his choice confirmed			1
he says , though , that the ideologically divided court has undergone a lot of turnover in the past five years , and it 's impossible to predict how it will evolve			2
@entity2 notes that one thing is fairly clear : @entity10 will probably begin his search for a new justice with the candidates he did not select when he picked @entity28 for the court last year			1
@entity2 spoke with @entity1 on friday			2
here is an edited transcript			0
@entity1 : what do you think is the most significant role that @entity11 played on the court ? @entity2 : as the senior associate justice on the court , he had the second most formal authority to assign the writing of opinions after the chief justice , and he was undoubtedly the leader of the liberal wing and a very successful one			2
@entity1 : now , who will assume that senior associate justice role ? @entity2 : the senior associate justice role would be @entity46 now , but he votes with chief justice [ @entity11 ] @entity48 most of the time			1
so the senior liberal on the court would now be @entity52 , who is a less outgoing person than @entity11			0
@entity1 : do you expect we 'll see a marked change in how the court operates ? @entity2 : the court does n't change dramatically in terms of its operations			1
but as justice @entity60 used to say , " you change one justice , you change the whole court , " and i expect that will be true			0
by @entity8 standards , the last five years have been a period of enormous turnover			0
it 's not at all clear which side will be ahead when it 's all over			2
@entity1 : do you expect that there 's any potential the president 's nomination could change the complexion of the court ? @entity2 : i am certain the president will nominate someone who is generally sympathetic with @entity11 and @entity10 's own politics , but history shows it 's folly to predict with precision exactly how a justice will evolve over decades			1
@entity1 : what do you think are the two or three things that are most important to @entity10 in making this decision ? @entity2 : i think the most important criterion is a justice of integrity and intelligence			1
the second is a justice who shares his general views about law and the @entity97 , and third is someone who can get confirmed			0
@entity1 : what kind of a justice does he need to nominate in order to get a confirmation that is relatively easy ? @entity2 : he has 59 @entity15 senators , so it 's overwhelmingly likely that anyone he nominates will get confirmed			1
it 's important to remember that			0
by historic standards , this is a very large majority			0
yes , it is possible there will be a filibuster , but there has never been a successful filibuster to stop a @entity8 nominee in the modern era			0
@entity1 : and how important is age as a factor in his decision ? @entity2 : i think age is a huge factor , because one of the big appeals of @entity8 nominations is that they serve for life , and a 49 - year - old nominee will likely serve 10 years more than a 59 - year - old nominee			2
@entity1 : of the recent issues that have been before the court and the issues that are coming up , which of them are likely to be raised in the course of the debate over the nomination ? @entity2 : there are certain evergreens of constitutional conflict that come up , though nominees rarely address them directly			1
one is abortion , another is affirmative action , but to be sure , there will be questions about gun rights , there will be questions about the constitutionality of health care reform , and there will always be issues that we ca n't even anticipate			2
@entity1 : and do you think this resonates beyond @entity157 this year ? @entity2 : i do			2
when you 're talking about the @entity8 , you 're talking about social issues , which many people care very deeply about , so i think this is not just a @entity163 issue			1
@entity1 : you 've said that you 're a law school classmate and friend of [ solicitor general ] @entity165			0
what 's your view of her ? @entity2 : i think she is a formidable possible nominee			1
she seems to meet many of the criteria that @entity10 has talked about : intelligence , integrity , a consensus - builder , and she was just confirmed by the @entity16 as solicitor general last year , which is not a guarantee that she would get confirmed but certainly ca n't hurt			1
@entity1 : in her role as a law school dean , she was noted for bringing on conservative scholars ? @entity2 : that 's correct			2
she was known as a real defender of ideological diversity on the faculty			0
@entity1 : who do you think are the two or three other leading candidates ? @entity2 : i think presidents generally do n't like to reinvent the wheel with their @entity8 candidates			1
the finalists before were @entity165 , [ judge ] @entity193 of the @entity194 and @entity195 , the secretary of @entity196			0
i expect the list will begin with them and may include others			0
one illustration of how much the country has changed is that @entity11 is the only protestant on the court			0
it is a court now of six catholic justices and two @entity207 justices , compared to a time when there used to be a @entity205 seat and a @entity207 seat			0
@entity1 : do you think @entity10 would be mindful of that in making a selection ? @entity2 : i think religion now is more of a curiosity than a criterion for nomination			1
so , yes , he would be aware of it , but i do n't think it would make a difference .			0

@entity10 will likely begin search for nominee with candidates he did n't pick last time
@entity2 says social issues will be front and center in debate over nominee
he says @entity10 's majority in @entity16 means he will likely get choice confirmed
