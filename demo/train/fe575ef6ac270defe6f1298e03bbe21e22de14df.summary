@entity0 -- @entity4 's scandal - tainted government has come under fresh attack from opposition parties after a leading newspaper ran a front - page report alleging that auditors had found that the awarding of coal fields to private companies had deprived the treasury of $ 211 billion			1
as lawmakers from across the spectrum of opposition parties criticized prime minister @entity20 's administration over the @entity22 story on thursday , his office issued excerpts of a letter to him from the federal auditor that described the news report as " exceedingly misleading			1
" one of the country 's most respected dailies , the @entity22 cited what it said were the @entity32 and @entity33 ( @entity34 ) 's draft estimates from the awarding of 155 coal blocks to some 100 firms without auction between 2004 and 2009			0
the newspaper said the government had allocated areas for coal production to commercial operators without putting them up for competitive auction			1
according to the @entity34 's calculations , the newspaper said , the authorities sold the rights to the mining areas for much less than they were worth , passing on " undue benefits " to the companies			0
the report claimed the loss to the government was six times the size of the amount lost by the allotment of telecommunications frequencies in 2008 at below market value			1
the telecommunications scandal , the result of a @entity34 report , put tremendous pressure on @entity20 's government , leading to the resignations of top officials and fueling a powerful grassroots protest movement against corruption			1
but the national auditor said the report on the coal blocks misrepresented its findings			1
" the details being brought out were observations which are under discussion at a very preliminary stage and do not even constitute our pre-final draft and hence are exceedingly misleading , " read a portion of the @entity34 's letter made public by the prime minister 's office			1
" the leak of the initial draft causes great embarrassment as the audit report is still under preparation			1
such leakage causes very deep anguish , " it read			0
the letter came after opposition leaders sought a discussion in parliament over what they claimed to be a huge scandal			2
" this is the worst scam , " said @entity98 , spokesman for the opposition @entity99			1
" this government has lost , forfeited its right to continue in power , " he said			2
left - wing politicians were equally scathing in their reaction			0
" it is a serious scam , a very big scam			0
in fact , all these scams are taking place because of the wrong policies pursued by the government , favoring all corporate houses , big business houses in the country , " said @entity107 , a leader in the @entity108 of @entity4			1
he asked why the government had not awarded the coalfields through an auction process			0
a lawmaker from the @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , @entity120 , called for a wide - ranging investigation			0
before releasing the letter from the @entity34 , the government issued cautious comments on the matter			0
" i can not comment on the basis of newspaper reports , until i have the actual report ( of the @entity34 ) , " said coal minister @entity128			1
he insisted that no coal blocks had been granted during the second term of @entity20 's government , which began in 2009			2
" if the @entity34 has raised any objections over any such allocations before that , we will be able to make a comment only after studying them , " @entity128 said			0
@entity20 's government has been hit by a series of corruption allegations , including a damning 2010 @entity34 report about the underselling of the cell phone permits			1
it put the cost to the government coffers of that affair at around $ 31 billion dollars in lost revenues			2
the telecommunications licenses issued under the sale have since been revoked by the @entity153			0
a number of politicians , bureaucrats and company executives are facing trial after the telecommunications scandal shook the government			2
all the defendants have denied any wrongdoing			0
@entity20 's @entity163 , headed by @entity165 born @entity164 , paid a political price this month when it suffered a heavy defeat in a key regional vote			0
seen as a litmus test for the popularity of the national coalition , the recent elections in @entity4 's most populous state , @entity171 , gave a decisive majority to a provincial grouping			2
that was despite a rigorous campaign by the @entity163 to try to revive its fortunes in the region .			0

an audit found billions in lost revenue from coal field allocations , says @entity4 paper
the auditor says the newspaper report is " exceedingly misleading "
the government has already been damaged by a cell phone license scandal
