-- boy with stutter stops talking for ten years before going on to become one of the most revered voices in cinema history			1
it is a script @entity7 would have been proud to pen			2
but there was no need as this is the story of @entity11 , arguably the most well - known voice in modern cinema			1
the voice behind @entity16 's mask in the " @entity18 " trilogy told @entity0 's @entity19 that from the ages of five to 14 he barely spoke a word			1
" i stuttered so badly i gave up talking , " @entity11 said			1
he remembers the misery his condition caused him and says he is indebted to an @entity25 teacher who helped give him the confidence to start speaking again			2
" we were reading great literature , and the idea of being able to say those words really inspired me			2
i never expected to be able to write things like that , but i did want to enjoy saying them			0
" although his father was an actor the idea of acting had not occurred to the teenage @entity11 he says			1
" but the @entity25 teacher encouraged me saying : ' if you like the words you 've got to be able to say them '			0
that 's what started it			0
" despite voicing one of the most famous villains in film history , @entity11 kept quiet about his contribution until @entity16 was killed in " @entity47 " -- the final installment of the original " @entity18 " trilogy			1
he says it was fun to keep everyone guessing			0
" it became a big mystery -- ' who was that inside the mask ? ' " he said			0
" they used to say it sounds like @entity58 [ the @entity59 actor who famously starred in the 1973 @entity61 film " @entity62 " ]			0
and i would say yes it does			0
@entity58 has a slight @entity59 accent			0
it was more fun denying it than it was admitting it until the episode where @entity16 dies			2
then i accepted credit for it			0
" @entity11 has starred or voiced in more than 100 films as well as being the voice of the @entity0 network but he is currently enjoying a highly successful return to the stage			1
the @entity76 - winning actor has been playing the role of @entity78 in @entity80 classic drama " @entity78 " since 2008			1
