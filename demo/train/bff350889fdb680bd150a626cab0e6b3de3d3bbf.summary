@entity0 -- it 's a beautiful august morning in @entity3 , @entity4			1
i have just finished my regular jog around @entity7			1
no matter how often i stand here at my favorite spot to stretch , i can only marvel that this is actually my neighborhood and my view			1
in front of me , the @entity11 lies at the feet of the @entity0 skyline			1
to my right , the @entity15 basks in the glory of a thousand gazes from the first tour boat of the day			2
i look over at the @entity20 where i work and , as always , what strikes me is n't what i see , but what i do n't see anymore			2
the ghosts of the @entity25 never seem to fade from the skyline in my mind			2
i am a @entity28 , born in @entity29 , raised in @entity30 , but every bit as @entity31 as any of my fellow joggers or co-workers across the river			1
somehow , though , people expect me to react differently			1
the same ghosts haunt me			2
as i stretch my muscles , my mind unreels a troubling movie			2
the planes hit the buildings in horrifying slow motion			2
mangled bodies and torture in @entity51			2
bombs hit mosques in @entity30			2
school girls killed in @entity56			2
even though it 's my movie , it always ends the same way			2
i feel helpless , powerless and lost			2
it 's a far cry from the way i felt 14 years ago when i first saw the view from @entity7			2
in my 20s then , i had come over from @entity63 to @entity0 on business			2
after a busy work week i left early on friday to spend the weekend with my cousin in @entity3			0
he parked the car on the waterfront			0
we got out , walked over the swell of a small hill and then it was like someone flipped a switch			0
there , suddenly , was the @entity0 skyline , more massive and impressive than i ever could have imagined			0
my cousin looked at me and said , " this is what keeps young men up at night in @entity30			0
" what he meant was that they lie awake at night dreaming of a better life in @entity31 and hoping , yearning that one day they would see this skyline with their very own eyes			1
that was the moment i decided i would live in @entity0			0
when i first moved here , i felt welcomed			0
i was truly impressed by the fact that @entity31 gave me as an immigrant the same opportunities it did to its own citizens			1
today , that is still largely the case , unless your name is @entity98 or if you choose to wear the hijab			0
since 9/11 , almost every muslim in this country has a story			0
and it 's no longer one of welcome			0
it 's 6 - month - old @entity28 babies on the " no fly " list			1
it 's searches and racial profiling at airport security			0
it 's suspicious looks from neighbors			0
it 's families being split apart by persecution during the immigration process			0
we experience this where we work and live			0
and then we turn on the nightly news and see more hatred			0
like the church in @entity127 that 's planning a quran burning event on the anniversary of 9/11			0
like the sad irony of the @entity131 ( a group actually formed to " secure justice and fair treatment for all against ... hatred , prejudice and bigotry " ) now speaking out against the @entity138 center to promote interfaith dialogue and education being proposed for near the former @entity141			0
some people have clearly decided that 9/11 gives them the right to persecute @entity28			1
and as a result , we are all collectively paying for the sins of terrorists -- a radical , crazy few who just happen to share the same religious background			0
this change of behavior does n't just hurt @entity28 , it attacks the very fabric of what made @entity31 great			1
the very reason people all over the world lie awake in their beds dreaming of coming here is that they knew they would be treated fairly in this mythical " land of opportunity			1
" @entity31 built that global brand with blood , sweat and sacrifices and it is being tarnished with every act of intolerance			1
president @entity166 and the secretary of state @entity167 have shown that they not only understand , but are also willing to address the core issues and move @entity31 foreign policy back toward balanced and fair ground			1
it wo n't be easy			0
it wo n't be quick to implement			0
but the basic truth is this : killing people will not fix this problem			1
building bridges of understanding , rebuilding shattered economies in @entity47 , @entity30 and @entity56 and educating citizens on both sides will			0
the day before the @entity141 bombings , @entity31 was my home			1
the next day , i woke up a stranger in a strange land			0
i wish every @entity31 could understand that i am not the enemy			1
we want to be part of the solution			1
we want to build international bridges and help tolerance grow in @entity31 and around the world			1
after all , how can @entity31 hope to have its global vision accepted by the 1.5 billion muslims around the world unless leaders can first sell it here at home to 6 million of their own citizens ? the first step in achieving this is to get back to basics			1
@entity31 grew into a beacon of liberty and freedom because it gave every citizen the unalienable right to " @entity207			1
" it 's time to give that back to everyone , regardless of religion			0
most @entity28 men do not have beards and most @entity28 women do not wear the hijab			1
but , if you see one on the street who does , please change your reaction from suspicion to openness , from judgment to acceptance			1
engage as human beings , not as stereotypes			1
simple acts of goodwill would change far more hearts and minds than any gun - fueled campaign or international policy			0
then someday , here at @entity7 , i might be able to stop running , admire the incredible view and rewrite the end of my movie			0
i very much want to replace " powerless and lost " with " hopeful and optimistic			0
" i want the @entity0 skyline to once more inspire dreams of the possible , not echoes of the past			1
i want to come home again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			1

@entity31 liberties are the dream of many in the @entity28 world , @entity248 writes
@entity254 : those dreams are marred by suspicion that greets @entity28 here
@entity246 : @entity259 are not the enemy , and can be part of the solution
he says people should engage with muslims as people , not as stereotypes
