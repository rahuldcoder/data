on sunday 's @entity2 " show , anchor @entity3 asked sen. @entity4 , a simple question : " are we safer now than we were a year ago , two years ago , in general ? " @entity4 's ' answer was unambiguous , " i do n't think so			1
i think terror is up worldwide			0
the fatalities are way up			0
... there are more groups than ever , and there is huge malevolence out there			0
" @entity3 seemed surprised by this response : " i have to say , that is not the answer i expected			0
i expected to hear , oh , we 're safer			2
" @entity10 backed up @entity4 's gloomy assessment , saying , " oh , i absolutely agree that we 're not safer today			1
" both @entity4 and @entity10 are able public servants who , as the heads of the two @entity31 intelligence oversight committees , are paid to worry about the collective safety of @entity31 , and they are two of the most prominent defenders of the @entity37 's controversial surveillance programs , which they defend as necessary for @entity31 security			1
but is there any real reason to think that @entity31 are no safer than was the case a couple of years back ? not according to a study by the @entity43 of every militant indicted in the @entity31 who is affiliated with @entity46 or with a like - minded group or is motivated by @entity46 's ideology			1
in fact , the total number of such indicted extremists has declined substantially from 33 in 2010 to nine in 2013			0
and the number of individuals indicted for plotting attacks within the @entity31 , as opposed to being indicted for traveling to join a terrorist group overseas or for sending money to a foreign terrorist group , also declined from 12 in 2011 to only three in 2013			1
of course , a declining number of indictments does n't mean that the militant threat has disappeared			0
one of the militants indicted in 2013 was @entity62 , who is one of the brothers alleged to be responsible for the @entity65 bombings in april			0
but a sharply declining number of indictments does suggest that fewer and fewer militants are targeting the @entity31			1
recent attack plots in the @entity31 also do not show signs of direction from foreign terrorist organizations such as @entity46 , but instead are conducted by individuals who are influenced by the ideology of violent jihad , usually because of what they read or watch on the @entity78			1
none of the 21 homegrown extremists known to have been involved in plots against the @entity31 between 2011 and 2013 received training abroad from a terrorist organization -- the kind of training that can turn an angry , young man into a deadly , well - trained , angry , young man			1
of these extremists , only @entity88 , one of the alleged @entity90 bombers , is known to have had any contact with militants overseas , but it is unclear to what extent , if any , these contacts played in the @entity65 bombings			2
in short , the data on @entity46 - linked or - influenced militants indicted in the @entity31 suggests that the threat of terrorism has actually markedly declined over the past couple of years			1
where @entity4 and @entity10 were on much firmer ground in their interview with @entity3 was when they pointed to the resurgence of a number of @entity46 groups in the @entity111			2
@entity46 's affiliates in @entity113 control much of the north of the country and are the most effective forces fighting the regime of @entity118			2
in neighboring @entity119 , @entity46 has enjoyed a renaissance of late , which partly accounts for the fact that the violence in @entity119 today is as bad as it was in 2008			0
the @entity113 war is certainly a magnet for militants from across the @entity127 world , including hundreds from @entity128 , and @entity128 governments are rightly concerned that returning veterans of the @entity113 conflict could foment terrorism in @entity128			0
but , at least for the moment , these @entity46 groups in @entity113 and @entity119 are completely focused on overthrowing the @entity118 regime or attacking what they regard as the @entity137 - dominated government of @entity119			0
and , at least so far , these groups have shown no ability to attack in @entity128 , let alone in the @entity31 .			2

heads of intelligence committees tell @entity2 @entity31 is no safer than in 2011
@entity144 : evidence suggests that fewer plots are being directed against the @entity31
there 's little sign of @entity31 being trained by jihadists overseas , he says
@entity153 : the committee chiefs are correct about *stepped* up jihadist activity in @entity111
