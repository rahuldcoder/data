-- is the world spinning out of control ? i get asked this question a lot these days , and for understandable reasons			1
look at what 's been in the news in just the last few weeks			0
the @entity9 and @entity11 's execution videos , @entity13 's bid for secession , @entity16 soldiers in @entity17			0
there is an unraveling taking place in parts of the world			1
in the @entity25 , the old order that stretched from @entity24 to @entity11 has collapsed			1
in @entity16 , the rise of oil prices has empowered and emboldened president @entity28 -- and he wants a makeover on the fall of the @entity31			0
@entity28 is testing the stability of the old international order built after @entity34 , and sees that it is weaker than most people might have guessed			1
but why is all this happening ? in the @entity25 , people were tired of the old dictatorships			1
they were n't prepared for what should follow them , but they wanted greater space and voice			1
the result has been chaos and violence , but perhaps that is the brutal , ugly phase that will force people there to find a way to make their peace with the modern world			1
after all , @entity52 went through its own religious wars , wars or nationalism , and world wars before it became the stable continent it is today			1
similarly , in @entity62 , the real driver of what has happened there is not the @entity63 or @entity16 , but the @entity17 people			1
they decided that they did n't want to be vassals of the @entity68			1
they look with longing at @entity70 , which in 1989 had a similar - sized economy to theirs and is now twice the size , and is a member in good standing of the @entity76			0
of course there are @entity17 who feel differently -- that 's what 's causing the turmoil -- but most , overwhelmingly , want to chart a future with the @entity63			1
whether they can remains an open question , given @entity28 's firm resolve to sabotage their plans			0
but again , this is a sign of people searching for greater connections with the civilized world			1
and look at the rest of the world			2
@entity90 and @entity91 have elected leaders who are friendly towards markets , the @entity63 , and @entity94 -- resolutely democratic and yet strong nationalists			0
@entity96 and @entity97 have reformers at the helm			0
in @entity101 , there are many governments from @entity103 to @entity104 , where you see real progress in health and living conditions			0
there are many pieces of bad news coming out of that continent -- from @entity113 to @entity114 -- but there is also good news , growing economies , a surging middle class			2
and look at the world 's two largest economies			2
the @entity94 remains economically vibrant , with a dynamic society , new technologies that dominate the world , and new sources of energy that will power it for a few generations			2
@entity129 , for all the noise , remains committed to economic development first , is embarking on anti-corruption and reform drives and has even begun to tackle pollution and climate change as an issue			0
i 'm not saying that all is well in the world -- i 'm really suggesting that we are in the midst of great global change			2
much of this change is driven by good news -- people 's desires for greater freedom and autonomy , new information technologies , etc. but all change is disruptive , and without the institutions of freedom and the civic culture of liberty , this period of transition can be dangerous			2
the forces of integration will not automatically triumph over the forces of disintegration			0
but there are many good forces out here that are also sweeping through the world these days			0
and , of course , @entity13 did not end up seceding			0
score one for integration .			0
