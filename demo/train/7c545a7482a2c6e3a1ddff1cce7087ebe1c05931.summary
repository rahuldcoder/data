-- in one of the clinics in @entity4 , a young fighter asks that we conceal his identity , going simply by the name @entity8			1
three years ago , when @entity11 's revolution had not yet morphed into the brutal war it is today , the 20 - year - old was still in high school			1
his ambition in life was to be a doctor , but a year - and - a - half ago that all changed			0
" we reached a point where if we do n't fight , we will get killed , it was the only option , " @entity8 tells us , one hand rubbing against the bandages swathed around his waist			0
" if i do n't fight for my country then who is going to ? " @entity8 was wounded during the fighting for the town of @entity27 , just across the border			2
" it 's a strategic area , it 's a main access route to get the wounded out and the medical and other aid in , " dr. @entity31 explains , as he checks @entity8 's wounds			0
pleas for mercy in pre-revolution @entity11 dr. @entity31 was a gastroenterologist , hardly equipped to deal with war wounds ranging from bullets to severed limbs			1
the doctor is a familiar face , known to us in the media and the world from countless @entity47 videos during the fighting for the town of @entity49			0
often overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of casualties dr. @entity31 would broadcast impassioned pleas for mercy , for help , but none came			0
he spent more than two years apart from this family			0
over the summer when @entity49 , due to an influx of hardened @entity59 fighters fell back to the regime , dr. @entity31 fled to @entity61			2
" it 's not just a war with weapons -- it 's a war on our soul , our psyche , " he says			2
" it 's all death , but at least here it is slightly more gentle			0
" increasing tensions @entity4 was once a sleepy border town tucked amidst the mountainous terrain of @entity61 's eastern frontier with @entity11			1
the flow of @entity11 refugees has seen the town 's population roughly triple , makeshift camps seeping into any open space or empty lot			1
@entity61 hit the one million registered @entity11 refugee mark last week			1
the number is on track to hit 1.5 million , according to the @entity85			1
this in a country whose own population is 4.4 million			2
aid agencies can offer little			0
the @entity85 ' refugee agency , the @entity90 , says it only has $ 242 million of the $ 1.89 billion needed just for the @entity11 refugee crisis in @entity61 alone			1
some towns house more @entity11 than @entity61 , and while many @entity61 sympathize with the plight of the @entity11 , the strain being put on this tiny nation is unsustainable and tensions are increasing			1
lives forever scarred @entity4 finds itself in the crosshairs of the @entity11 war , a @entity102 enclave in @entity61 's @entity104 valley -- @entity59 's stronghold			1
@entity59 dispatched its fighters to battle alongside the @entity108 regime , its hardened fighters allowing the @entity11 government to reclaim key towns and territory close to the @entity61 border , choking - off key supply lines for the rebels , and sending masses streaming into @entity61			1
lives lost , lives forever scarred , a population that hardly recognizes its homeland or in many cases even itself , thrown into the midst of unimaginable violence , adapting to survive			0
in one of the newest refugee camps on the outskirts of @entity4 , under a rusty @entity127 , the youngest residents dart through large chunks of limestone			2
the men gather around us , angry , desperate , frustrated			0
" is this a way to live ? " one man demands			0
" if we were animals the world would have more compassion			0

the @entity61 town of @entity4 lies just across the border from war - torn @entity11
since the @entity11 conflict broke out , the flow of refugees has roughly tripled @entity4 's population
a million @entity11 refugees are now registered with the @entity85 's refugee agency in @entity61
the @entity85 says it has just $ 242m of the $ 1.89b it needs for the crisis in @entity61 alone
