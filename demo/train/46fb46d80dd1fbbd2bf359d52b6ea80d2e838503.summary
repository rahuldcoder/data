-- the more i think about it the more i am convinced i need one of @entity5 's old guitars			1
@entity6 is hosting an auction of " @entity10 's " gear in @entity9			1
i really should be there and as a responsible parent make some investments for my children 's futures			1
now nobody should take financial advice from a washed - up , failed rock guitarist like me			0
but if you will just go with me on this , i do think i may be onto something			0
no doubt , vintage guitars made by the right company , at the right time , and played by the right people , are a serious investment opportunity			2
headlines were made in 2004 when @entity5 's @entity29 guitar sold for $ 959,000			1
actually that guitar broke one of the usual rules for collectors because it was not all original			2
he had swapped parts from other guitars , which usually kills the resale value			2
but what it did have was provenance			2
this was the guitar that @entity5 had used over two decades , both in the studio and on stage			1
it also had a lot of people who wanted to buy it -- baby boomers who grew up with @entity5 , the provider of soundtracks for their lives			1
and you can own the very guitar he played those tunes on ? if you had just under a million bucks burning a hole your pocket it would be crazy not to			2
there is nothing that iconic at these sales , but there is a range of very tasty @entity5 stuff			1
beyond guitars there are amplifiers ( also very collectable ) , stage clothes and other memorabilia			2
as an investment , provided you avoid bidding frenzy , these would be instruments of unquestioned authenticity , many of which have been used on record and in public performance by a star who has been making music and selling out concerts for nearly 40 years			1
the money @entity5 raised in these sales goes to the @entity86 , which he founded , which treats drug and alcohol addiction			1
so , it 's for a good cause , it 's a good investment , and you finish up with a really cool guitar			1
guitars can be a great investment			2
key vintage @entity96 guitars more than doubled in value in the last decade			1
if you have an original " @entity99 " from the 1950s or early 1960s in what as known as a custom color ( taken from popular auto colors of the period ) , you could be looking at a value of up to $ 50,000 -- not bad for something that would not have cost more than $ 100 when new			2
of course most people who bought them back then did not do so thinking they were long - term investments so parts were changed , the finishes were battered and repainted and value was subsequently diminished			0
i bought a 1961 @entity99 all original expect for having been stripped down to the wood			0
it cost between half and a third of what it would have done if the paint had still been on			0
now there is a thriving trade in so called " relic guitars " which are new but treated to give the impression of a battered old road warrior			0
worrying , there are also a lot of guitars being sold as original vintage pieces , which have had parts changed out			1
the money involved makes it worthwhile for the fakers who go to great lengths to disguise the changes			0
so the buyer beware , and always seek out what provenance and guarantees you can			0
there is one guitar that is the stradivarius for collectors			0
it is the @entity144 , made between 1958 and 1960			0
if you had bought one back then -- and you may well have got a discount because it was not a big seller at the time -- you would now be sitting on a guitar which can change hands for well in excess of $ 250,000			1
how does that happen ? well , it brings us back to @entity5			1
he played a @entity155 on an album by @entity157 and @entity158			0
the recording is legendary among guitar players			0
suddenly the discontinued @entity155 was in demand			0
its value rose , and then soared as it was adopted by one superstar after another			0
we are talking @entity167 , @entity169 's @entity168 , @entity171 's @entity170			0
music world honors @entity155 @entity5 's @entity155 is thought to have been stolen while he was in rehearsals with his band cream			1
now if that ever showed up , @entity29 might well end up being the second most valuable guitar sold in open auction			1
so if you want to buy a vintage guitar and have a partner who takes an alternative perspective , point out you are doing it for them , for their future			0
and if you find yourself bidding against some heavy set , balding guy , who looks like he knows he really should not be there , give him a break and let him win .			0
