-- in a dusty campsite in central @entity3 more than 30 years ago , a mother 's cries of " a dingo 's got my baby " set the stage for one of the country 's most intriguing murder mysteries			1
the final scenes are set to be played out in court on friday when a coroner will hear new evidence that her parents hope will once and for all confirm @entity17 's official cause of death			1
" we want a finding that @entity24 was taken by a dingo , " said @entity19 , the lawyer representing @entity20 and her former husband @entity21			1
" there is a lot of new evidence			0
the last inquest was in 1995 and since then there have been a number of significant dingo attacks , " @entity19 said			2
@entity17 was just two months old when she was snatched from a tent in august , 1980 during a family holiday to @entity35 , the sacred @entity37 site more commonly known then as @entity35			1
her body has never been found			0
@entity20 's claims that a dingo snatched her baby caused shock , then incredulity , before a suspicious public turned their gaze on the then 32 - year - old mother - of - three			1
the first inquest into @entity24 's death in 1981 found that the baby died as a result of being taken by a dingo , but a second the following year committed her mother to trial for murder			1
the 35 - day hearing created a media frenzy in @entity3 as commentators picked apart the intricacies of the case , while a fascinated public speculated wildly as to why and how @entity24 had died			1
" a lot of people just never believed a dingo was capable of doing it , " @entity19 said			2
the jury returned its verdict in 1982 ; @entity20 was found guilty of slitting her daughter 's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding the body and concocting a story about a dingo to cover her crime			1
she was sentenced to life in jail			0
her husband @entity21 was given a suspended sentence after being found guilty of being an accessory after the fact			2
the couple had two other children ; two boys aged six and four at the time of @entity24 's death			1
@entity20 served four years of her sentence before the @entity88 government ordered her release in 1986 after the discovery of new evidence ; a baby 's jacket , believed to be @entity24 's , found half - buried near a dingo lair at @entity35			1
in 1988 , a @entity95 set up to review the evidence formally quashed convictions for both husband and wife			2
despite the finding that the couple was not to blame , a third inquest into their daughter 's death returned an open verdict in 1995			1
it is that ruling that the @entity108 now want changed			0
" certainly , like any parent , they want closure and they 're not going to be able to get closure until the record 's correct , " @entity19 said			2
" at the moment an open finding is not a correct finding			2
" there 's certainly a personal part in the journey but they want to warn people and make sure the tragedy does n't occur again			2
" on friday , he 'll present the coroner with evidence of at least 12 " very significant " dingo attacks in @entity3 since the last inquest in 1995			2
in one of the worst cases , a nine - year - old boy was killed , and his friend mauled , by two dingoes on @entity133 , off the coast of @entity135 , in 2001			0
twenty - eight dingoes were culled in the public outcry that followed			0
the world 's largest sand island , @entity133 earned @entity141 status for its " exceptional beauty " and its rare combination of tall rainforests and towering sand dunes			0
it 's also home to the largest population of native @entity3 dingoes -- around 200 animals living in up to 30 packs -- and the site of most , if not all , dingo attacks			1
" on @entity133 the dingo has a particularly difficult role because tourists are as interested in the dingo as the dingo is interested in food , " said professor @entity154 , a dingo expert from the @entity155 in @entity156			0
" @entity163 , very often , is the only thing that stands between a dangerous animal and a human			0
once that fear is lost any predatory animal can become dangerous , " she said			0
@entity169 management strategies have been introduced in areas of the country where the mammals are prevalent			0
@entity133 's includes approval to cull specific animals considered to pose a threat to humans			0
" once a dingo has lost its fear of people and starts to use aggressive tactics to gain dominance over , or food from , people the habit can not be changed , " according to the @entity135 government 's campaign " be dingo - safe ! " it adds : " these dingoes display aggressive or dangerous behaviour such as nipping and biting , and in some cases this escalates very quickly to attacks and serious mauling			1
" @entity19 says that , if nothing else , the couple hope a change in the official cause of @entity24 's death makes " public authorities more aware of their responsibilties			1
" " this will make them fine tune , hopefully , those plans and make them current and keep updating them , " he said			0
where once many people -- including the jury that convicted @entity20 and @entity209 -- believed that it was unlikely that a dingo would kill a baby , evidence in recent years shows that it is indeed possible			1
however , @entity154 said public opinion had swung too far the other way , and that @entity3 's largest native predator had been " demonized			0
" " a dingo is a suitable animal to be demonized , is n't it ? in one way you can know it , and in the other way it 's mysterious , " she said			1
@entity154 warned that if more was n't done to protect the animals in their natural habitat , they would eventually die out			0
" this is a very rare and endangered @entity3 native animal , " she said			0
" if that goes extinct , there will be outcry in future that we 've allowed that to happen , because there are so many misconceptions about the animal			0
