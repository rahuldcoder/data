it 's a fact that all - inclusive resorts can be expensive , with the average nightly rate at some of the bigger chains running $ 450 -- per person			1
and when you find one in your price range there 's usually a caveat -- the beach is a 15 - minute drive away , or the " all " only includes non-alcoholic beverages ( those margaritas by the pool really add up )			1
@entity17 's editors love a challenge and -- though it was n't easy -- they found eight beachfront all - inclusive resorts in the @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 starting at around $ 100 per person , per night			1
and they really are all - inclusive : a double room , three meals a day , drinks ( from soda to cocktails ) , and lots of activities			1
and each one has an added bonus , too , from tennis lessons to scuba instructions			0
the only thing not included ? caveats			1
22 ca n't miss @entity39 beaches @entity40 , @entity41 set on 40 acres ( including a mile of white sand ) , the @entity42 is great for those who want to get out on the turquoise water			0
kayaks , windsurfers , and paddleboats are all at the ready and there are also two pools			0
would you rather just take in the view of the waves ? the 464 rooms all have at least partial ocean views			1
the resort also has five restaurants ranging from a casual beach take - out place to the @entity59			2
bonus : a proper afternoon tea with scones and cucumber sandwiches is also offered every day in the courtyard -- a nod to the island 's @entity67 roots			0
@entity69 , @entity41 , 866/905 - 6559 , jollybeachresort.com			2
from $ 221 per person , per night			1
@entity71 , @entity72 @entity74 out to the far western tip of @entity72 and you 'll find this lively beachfront resort in @entity71			0
it is right on the beach , but the place to be is by one of the umbrella - shaded loungers around the two gigantic pools ( both are well over 3,000 square feet )			2
there is a party atmosphere here -- the complimentary mini bars and liquor dispensers in the 420 guest rooms are regularly restocked			0
if you want to go all out , head to the @entity93 nightclub , where reggae is sure to be spinning			0
if you are looking for quiet , try the solarium terrace			0
bonus : you 'll score extra perks like complimentary entry and drinks at the posh @entity93 nightclub and a free introductory scuba diving lesson in the resort pool			0
@entity103 , @entity71 , @entity72 , 888/748 - 4990 , riu.com			2
from $ 98 per person , per night			1
@entity17 : see more photos of the all - inclusive resorts @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 operates six hotels in the @entity111 , but this resort 10 minutes from @entity108 gives you the most for your money			1
the 516 rooms ( which all have either a terrace or balcony ) are located in thatch - roof buildings painted cheerful shades of yellow and purple			2
the entire property underwent a full renovation in 2011 resulting in completely remodeled rooms , a new lobby , and a renovated kids ' club			0
there are three a la carte restaurants featuring @entity131 , @entity22 , and international cuisine , plus a buffet restaurant			1
if you are n't content to just sit on the beach or the massive pool , there are activities all around the resort , from archery and tennis to kayaking and diving			0
bonus : while some all - inclusive resorts only serve house - brand liquor , bartenders at @entity107 pour from imported names as well ( @entity148 , @entity149 , etc. )			1
@entity150 4 , @entity108 , @entity111 , 888/923 - 2722 , iberostar.com			2
from $ 69 per person , per night ( three - night minimum )			1
@entity17 : best new theme park rides @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 this 1,170 - room mega resort 90 minutes from @entity157 does things big from its spot on a mile of secluded beach			1
there are eight pools , 10 restaurants , and 11 bars ( including one swim - up ) , which means you 'll rarely do or see the same thing twice			2
play in the @entity168 with free paddleboards , kayaks , or windsurfers , or check out the local underwater residents with the provided snorkel gear			0
the nightlife is also big here and the party goes long after the sun sets ( which probably has something to do with the open bar )			0
bonus : though the base - rate is for a garden - view room , each one has a terrace or balcony overlooking the tropical foliage			1
@entity187 , km 115 , 011 - 507/993 - 2255 , decameron.com			2
from $ 111 per person , per night			1
@entity189 , @entity22 the @entity191 's budget - friendly price makes it a deal , but most people travel here for the location on a sandy beach on quiet @entity197			1
the resort re-opened in november of 2011 after a $ 10 million upgrade to all the rooms ( including new furniture , flat - screen tvs , and fully renovated bathrooms ) and restaurants as well as the addition of a new spa ( alas , massages are n't covered in the all - inclusive rate and start at $ 68 )			1
there are only 285 rooms , but you 'll find the choices typical of a much larger resort			0
there are four bars and eight restaurants ranging from seafood to @entity59 to @entity22 ( and the small size means no reservations are required )			1
bonus : embrace your inner @entity221 or @entity223 and perfect your serve at the free tennis clinics			0

@entity17 : 10 travel mistakes and how not to make them @entity232 , @entity22 this @entity234 resort makes the most of its location : the pool runs lengthwise along the sand , and there 's even a beachfront infinity whirlpool			1
the @entity241 , located in the heart of the @entity243 on @entity244 , has 453 rooms , and each one has a view of either the @entity248 or @entity249			0
the rooms were renovated in december of 2011 and now feature luxury updates like marble floors , flat - screen tvs , and rain showers -- perfect for washing off all that sand			2
bonus : one of the downsides of an all - inclusive resort is that you have to eat every meal on - site			2
@entity241 includes a @entity262 pass that covers one dinner at a local restaurant			0
@entity265 km 9.5 , @entity244 , 800/437 - 9605 , krystal - hotels.com			2
from $ 176 per person , per night			1
@entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 staying here affords travelers the best of both worlds : the resort is on a secluded beach surrounded by rainforests and a national park , but is less than a mile from the popular town of @entity268			0
this is a low - key resort , with just one buffet restaurant and one a la carte restaurant serving @entity283 cuisine ( there is an additional $ 36 - $ 42 fee for the a la carte restaurant ) and one bar , plus a small casino and an amphitheater with daily entertainment			1
but the 134 rooms have views of the @entity168 or the estuary of @entity294 , part of the national park			2
bonus : tipping for the staff is included in the rate , so no need to reach for your wallet every time you order another round			0
@entity306 , @entity268 , 800/227 - 2356 , barcelo.com			2
from $ 188 per person , per night			1
@entity17 : @entity23 's most beautiful lighthouses @entity309 , @entity310 at just 246 rooms , this family - friendly resort is a fraction of the size of the 4,000 - room @entity316 next door			1
but it 's also a fraction of the price for the all - inclusive option			0
@entity309 is on a private beach and has a large pool and three places to dine -- a pool - side grill , a buffet , and a steak and seafood a la carte restaurant			0
unwinding is the first order of business here , so you wo n't find the same 24/7 whirl of activity here as at the mega resorts			1
but that does n't mean anyone in your family will be bored			0
the kids ' camp keeps them busy with sand castle building and craft making , and offers fun , active sports like pool volleyball and beach bowling			0
bonus : if you 've ever wanted to learn how to dive , this is the place : the resort offers a complimentary scuba lesson in the pool			0
