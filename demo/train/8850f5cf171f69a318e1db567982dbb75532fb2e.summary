-- " goodbye , @entity0 , and thank you			1
" fifteen years after @entity4 , @entity5 's then - director of civil aviation , bid farewell and turned off the lights at @entity5 @entity0 , the old airport has been given a new life			1
with official ceremonies set for this week , it will be rechristened @entity12			1
the new facility will accommodate cruise ships and other large vessels			0
@entity17 's @entity16 will be the first ship to arrive at the cruise ship berth -- formerly runway 13 -- today at 8 p.m. before its closure in 1998 , @entity0 ( the first recorded flight from the site took place in 1925 ) was regarded as one of the most difficult airports in the world for pilots to fly into and out of			1
as it sat in the middle of @entity31 , with a runway protruding into the sea , landing in @entity0 was a hair - raising event even for experienced pilots			1
@entity37 ' general manager of operations and pilot @entity39 has 36 years of flying experience			1
" as a pilot , it was totally unique			2
it was the only major airport in the world that required a 45 - degree turn below 500 feet to line up with the runway , literally flying between the high - rise buildings , passing close to the famous orange and white checkerboard as you made that final turn toward the runway , " he said			1
@entity53 , a teacher and aviation photographer from @entity55 who has lived in @entity5 since 1987 , spent countless hours photographing the amazing scenes of large aircraft swooping in over the @entity5 skyline			2
( see a gallery of his work above			0
) " @entity0 was very different to most international airports because it was right in the city , " recalled @entity53			1
" @entity63 ( a prominent hill in @entity5 ) blocks the standard straight - in approach ; thus planes had to make that special turn over @entity31 while landing on runway 13			1
" " this was quite a challenge , especially in strong wind conditions , " @entity39 said			0
" as @entity37 pilots , we had plenty of practice and became very adept at flying the approach			1
" the approach was quite a challenge for pilots from other airlines , especially in more demanding flying conditions , as they might only come to @entity0 once a year			1
" @entity83 's most ' thrilling ' airports , where thrilling = terrifying scariest moment : ' we never saw the actual plane ! ' @entity53 recalls watching flights landing at @entity0 during those " demanding flying conditions			1
" " being at the @entity0 car park watching airplanes land in heavy rain could be very worrying , " he said			2
" the pilots could not see the runway , and landing over @entity31 , you had to be visual with the runway			2
" some ( pilots ) seemed to wait a little longer than others before they aborted the landing and went around for another go			2
some would appear out of the low clouds on the approach path , then power up and vanish back into the clouds			0
" the scariest memory for @entity53 was the landing of an @entity106 747 - 200 freighter contending with an extremely low ceiling			2
" we could hear it coming but saw no sign of the landing lights			0
it was dark , " he said			0
" it got louder and louder ; then you could see the glow of the red beacon under the plane			0
he overshot the turn and went right over the car park and control tower as he powered up and went around for another try			0
" " that was very loud and worrying , as we never saw the actual plane ! " fond memories of @entity0 although the much larger and more modern @entity127 ( which opened in july 1998 ) is considered one of the best airports in the world , @entity0 is still missed in some quarters			1
it served @entity5 for 73 years and was something of a city symbol , known to travelers worldwide			0
" i have very fond memories of @entity0 , " @entity39 said			0
" when i first joined @entity37 , i spent many happy hours walking around @entity31 every time i had a visitor in town , watching the aircraft fly low over the houses and shops			0
" the approach looked really amazing from the ground , and also as a passenger , especially if you were seated on the right - hand side of the aircraft			0
" @entity146 's favorite route was arriving from @entity147 or @entity148 , northeast of @entity5			2
" this allowed the pilot to fly the aircraft initially along the @entity153 shipping channel before turning around the end of @entity155 , past @entity156 , and heading toward the checkerboard to make the final approach , " he remembered			0
" passengers lucky enough to have a window seat had a fantastic view of the south side of @entity155 , then @entity163 and the harbor before landing over @entity31			0

@entity0 , @entity5 's former airport , set to *reopen* as @entity12
closed in 1998 , @entity0 was one of world 's most challenging airports for pilots
a @entity37 pilot recalls unique 45 - degree turn when landing at @entity0
many pilots aborted first landing during *bad* weather and swung around for another go
