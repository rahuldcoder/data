-- our democracy is endangered			1
not by the @entity3 , @entity4 , the @entity6 regime , or even terrorists			2
to quote @entity9 : " we have met the enemy and he is us			0
" inside the beltway , the fingers point and the media tuts and struts in glee , and we , the @entity16 public , respond by becoming more rigid and divided ourselves			1
no more " truth springing from argument amongst friends , " as @entity17 said			0
a recent nonpartisan @entity21 finds our knee - jerk partisanship has increased dramatically			1
this road we 're on will lead us step - by - step to an extreme : either an autocratic government that functions , or a dysfunctional anarchy			1
the petty squabbles , bilge in the name of party or principle , will dissolve our self - government			1
@entity34 felt no foreign power could ever defeat the @entity16			0
he said , " from whence shall we expect the approach of danger ? shall some trans - @entity40 military giant step the earth and crush us at a blow ? never ... no , if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher			1
as a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide			0
" we 're pointing a pistol at our heads			0
a government of , by , and for the people requires that people talk to people , that we can agree to disagree but do so in civility			1
if we let the politicians and those who report dictate our discourse , then our course will be dictated			1
why am i alarmed ? because two " scandals " -- the @entity66 tax - exempt inquiries and the @entity68 's tapping of reporters ' phones -- have become lynch parties			1
and the congressional investigation of @entity72 may become a scandal in itself			0
the @entity66 scandal has sparked bipartisan outrage that should require a bipartisan solution			1
the director who oversaw this was a @entity79 appointee who was confirmed by a @entity80			0
even @entity82 reporter @entity81 says he doubts very much that @entity83 was involved we , the people , need to stay focused on facts , causes and solutions			1
let 's begin with the findings of the @entity92 's inspector general who uncovered it : that it was bureaucratic mismanagement , but that there was no evidence of any political motivation or influence from outside the @entity66			1
and that , according to acting commissioner @entity100 , who just resigned , the problem started because the @entity103 's @entity102 decision created a surge of requests by political groups for tax - exempt status			1
democrats and @entity109 agree there 's a problem			0
maybe they should focus on solutions			2
let 's demand an end to partisan sideshows or media witch hunts : it turns out that the leaked @entity120 @entity72 e-mails which allegedly show a coverup of a terrorist attack were themselves altered			0
those e-mails are , in a word , bogus next up on the playbill : the @entity68 secretly obtained dozens of reporters ' phone records because of a serious security leak			1
the double contradictory shell game we 're supposed to believe : @entity83 is not in charge and he has his finger in every pot. this bamboozling of the @entity16 people obscures the main point : how do we safeguard @entity16 lives and respect our freedoms at the same time ? maybe working together -- republicans and @entity139 , conservatives and liberals -- the @entity142 , a solution to the problem , can be passed			2
both the @entity139 and @entity109 have run roughshod over our separation of powers			0
both parties have misused and abused their constitutional powers			2
@entity139 blocked , again and again , president @entity79 's nominees for federal judges			0
today , @entity109 are n't just blocking @entity83 's judicial nominees , they 're blocking the @entity152 from considering laws and blocking @entity155 appointees necessary for the federal government to run			0
why should we allow any political party or personality to render our government unable to govern ? on 9/11 terrorists attacked the @entity162 , the @entity163 , and tried to attack the @entity16 @entity165 building in order to destroy our institutions , our economic strength , our military and our democratic @entity80 where " the people rule			2
" but in our partisan self - righteousness , we 're destroying our foundations of government more effectively than @entity174 ever could			2
whether it 's the media or the politicians , the churning of partisan passion into anger , indeed hate , has an ulterior purpose : if @entity83 's administration is constantly engaged in fighting for its existence , the governing comes to a halt , and his agenda will go nowhere			0
aiming for that and little if nothing else weakens and harms our democratic institutions , both @entity80 and the presidency			0
remember , @entity83 was elected by a bigger margin than @entity79			0
he deserves to have his appointees , and he deserves to have votes on the issues , to have the government function , and to fight for the policies on which he was elected			0
by allowing problems to become scandals and scandals to become demagoguery , we 're shooting ourselves in the foot			2
if it keeps up , we will all be complicit in weakening our democracy			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			1

@entity205 : knee - jerk partisanship is worse than ever in politics and public discourse
@entity205 : democracy endangered without civil discussion among people who disagree
@entity66 and @entity68 " scandals " have become lynch parties , she says
@entity205 : both parties and the public must stay focused on facts , causes and solutions
