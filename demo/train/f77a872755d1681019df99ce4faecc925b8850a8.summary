-- @entity1 struck first in baseball 's @entity2 on wednesday , beating @entity4 3 - 2 in game one courtesy of a pinch - hit from substitute batter @entity8			1
the @entity1 , searching for their 11th success in @entity12 's seven - game championship series , owed much to five relief pitchers who yielded just one hit to the @entity4 in three innings after taking the lead			1
" i do n't know what everyone else has been thinking about our team , " @entity8 , who came in for starting pitcher @entity17 , told the @entity12 website			2
" but we know what we can do			0
we 've just got to come out and keep doing it			0
" @entity17 lasted six innings before being pulled for @entity8 , despite concerns over an elbow injury			2
third baseman @entity28 scored the decisive run on a cold night at @entity30 after outfielder @entity8 hit a single in the bottom of the sixth innings off @entity4 relief pitcher @entity34			1
" when you get in the postseason , you have to win games in so many ways , " @entity28 said after @entity35 's @entity1 secured a 31st win in 44 games			1
" not every game is going to be the same			2
teams that win 90 , 95 , 100 games , they win ballgames different ways the entire year			0
" @entity4 ' starting pitcher @entity47 was critical of his own form , after extending a run which has seen him lose the @entity50 , game one of the @entity53 division series and now the opener of the @entity2			1
it stinks , " the 30 - year - old said			0
" i 'm here to win			0
i 'm not here to lose			0
i 'm not here to give up runs			0
i do n't work all year to have these negative press conferences afterwards			0
" @entity1 broke the deadlock of the @entity2 ' 107th edition at the bottom of the fourth inning when @entity66 batted in @entity67 and @entity68			1
@entity69 leveled at the top of the fifth with a two - run homer from catcher @entity73 , but @entity28 came home for the victory when outfielder @entity76 could not gather @entity8 's slice			1
history is against the @entity4 , who are searching for their first @entity2 success , with the last 10 winning teams in game one going on to clinch baseball 's biggest prize			1
game two will take place in @entity1 on thursday , before the series moves to @entity88 in @entity89 on saturday .			2
