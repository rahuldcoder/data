-- six buses , 40 teams , 48 hours and one winning business idea : the @entity5 is as close to blood sport as @entity8 entrepreneurship gets			1
part road trip , part code jam , the annual competition plunges participants , known as " buspreneurs , " into two days of frantic business development on the open road to the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
once the geeks climb aboard the @entity5 , the clock begins ticking			2
" everyone needs to bring their absolute a-game for 48 hours straight , " says @entity21 , one of the winners who emerged from last year 's inaugural @entity5 contest			1
" this can potentially bring about incredible performance			2
much like a man may be able to run much faster and fight much stronger when in mortal danger			0
" most startups headed for @entity16 have developed their ideas for months if not years			1
they arrive with high hopes of becoming the next @entity35 or @entity36 , both of which took off during @entity17 's annual gathering of the geek elite			0
by compressing the time from concept to prototype , the @entity5 becomes a pedal - to - the - metal business incubator , a rolling microcosm of what participants will encounter when they hit @entity16 's packed panels and parties , march 11 to 20			1
in fact , the @entity5 itself could be considered a meta startup : organizers this year are developing an online game , the @entity55 , in which players become virtual angel investors and invest in the companies as they 're built on the buses			1
players can upgrade their firms and win badges for accomplishments , all while real - world actions by the startup teams affect their standing			1
from @entity67 to @entity17 this year 's race began at 8 a.m. tuesday , with two buses leaving from @entity67 's @entity71 neighborhood and headed toward @entity18			1
teams now have two sleepless days , undoubtedly punctuated by rushed roadside meals and bouts of car sickness , to create the best startup prototype they can			1
wired : @entity16 geeks defend their foursquare turf when the buses arrive in @entity17 , development stops			1
after the mental and physical brutality , teams present their hurried masterpieces to a panel of expert judges during the interactive portion of this year 's @entity16			1
because of the networking opportunities , the publicity from last year 's contest and the sheer challenge of the undertaking , @entity5 founder @entity88 was flooded with applications this year from prospective buspreneurs			0
in 2010 , 50 people applied and 25 were selected			0
this year , 1,200 expressed interest when the @entity5 site launched , 300 were invited to apply , and 160 are actually going			0
but the numbers are only one way the project has grown			0
" we 've had better applicants with more impressive pitches than the ones we 've seen in the job openings at the places we work , " says @entity88 , who is a financial manager at search engine @entity103 and a scout for the @entity107 group of investors			0
two teams won last year : @entity115 , a startup designed to rent colleges ' vacant dorm rooms to travelers during the summer , and @entity120 , a @entity121 for dating profiles the service pulled from several sites			2
neither actually became real businesses , but many people involved in the @entity5 ' virgin voyage claim the experience was integral to both their personal and professional development , whether from skills learned or from connections made			1
@entity133 from the @entity135 team was accepted into startup funding firm @entity136 and launched @entity137 , which tracks family members by their cellphones			0
wired : @entity16 keeps @entity17 weird , wired and wild " i 've made at least a few very close friends in the experience , " says @entity21 , now one of this year 's @entity67 bus conductors , who does double duty as an it worker during the beat - the - clock coding marathon			1
" i believe this is largely due to the incredible constraints			0
" over the last year , the competition has grown from one bus to six			0
buses also left tuesday morning from @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 , amid send - off party hangovers			2
( yes , even nerds love beer			0
) the @entity67 teams drained a keg of @entity160 monday night at the offices of startup networking site @entity162			2
the meet - and - greet gave the buspreneurs a chance to sniff out potential teammates and competitors			0
" you look like an @entity178 user , " said @entity171 founder and ceo @entity170 to ghost nest founder @entity173 , who is , in fact , an @entity175 user			0
for an actual athletic competition , drinking the night before might be bad form			0
but beer is an integral part of the startup lifestyle			2
it takes the edge off the pressure			0
when the buses arrive in @entity17 , the buspreneuers will be rewarded with a tour of the local tech culture during the @entity191 , which promises " hot tech [ and ] cold beer			2
" the exact prizes for this year 's @entity5 competition are still being decided ( @entity196 and incubator access have been mentioned ) , but perhaps the most important rewards for participants are the networking opportunities and the potential for publicity			2
wired : @entity16 is a band 's social network like no other several documentary filmmakers are capturing the event and @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 have reporters on board some buses			1
see some of this year 's @entity5 participants in the gallery above , and stay tuned for updates from the road , as @entity218 reports every glitch , bathroom stench and late - night code dump on this perilous journey into the dot - com cosmos			1
