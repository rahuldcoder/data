-- the fat lady did n't sing on " @entity2 , " but she delivered one hell of a speech -- it 's stirring debate			2
a recent episode of @entity8 's hit fx series involved the comedian grappling with the idea of dating an overweight woman , played by actress @entity12			1
at one point late in the episode , @entity12 's character delivers a seven - minute speech that @entity17 called " absolutely magnificent			1
" the character @entity18 both berates @entity20 and laments the difficulties of dating as a plus - size woman -- though she 's not one to use euphemisms			1
" on behalf of all the fat girls , i 'm making you represent all the guys , " she says			2
" why do you hate us so much ? what is it about the basics of human happiness , feeling attractive , feeling loved , having guys chase after us , that 's just not in the cards for us ? nope			0
" ( warning : the following video contains explicit language			0
) it 's the usual uncomfortable style for @entity8 , who writes for and stars in the show that bears his name			1
the comic is known for making audiences feel queasy even as he has them laughing			0
@entity45 called the scene " @entity48 's @entity47			0
" " as brilliant as the speech is , and as brilliant as @entity12 's performance is , what makes this work is @entity2 's willingness to just stand there and take it , " @entity45 contributor @entity49 writes			0
" he makes a few lame gestures in self - defense , but even if @entity18 largely refuses to judge him , we do n't			2
" @entity12 told @entity61 she thought the scene " was so beautifully written			0
" " my interpretation of it was that she 's ( telling @entity2 ) , ' you saying , " you 're not fat , " is like saying , ' the worst thing a woman can be is fat , so i 'm not gon na call you that , ' " @entity12 said			0
" whereas she 's kinda like , ' yeah , i 'm fat			0
you know , i 'm nice , i 'm funny , i 'm cute -- so who cares ? ' " writing for the @entity73 , @entity72 applauded @entity8 for starting the conversation			1
" no matter how sad it may be that the only way many will start to understand this maligned populace is if a white guy explains it to them , the fact remains that through the platform of his critically acclaimed show , @entity8 has given voice to the fat girl , " she writes			1
but not everyone is a fan			0
writer @entity86 explored the episode for @entity88 , noting that " there 's zero representation for actual @entity91 ( ' fat admirers , ' which is admittedly a voyeuristic term ; i prefer the classic ' chubby chaser ' ) on tv			1
" " what 's despicable about television is n't that it 's not depicting enough happily - ever - after fantasies showing underdogs hitting the jackpot -- it 's that real life is actually better than these depictions , " @entity86 writes			2
" @entity18 would have far less trouble getting someone to hold her hand in real life , and while this was every bit the excellent , conversation - starting @entity2 episode it 's being touted as , is its creator , or anyone else in the tv bubble , actually aware of that fact ? " what do you think ? is too big a deal being made over the " @entity120 " episode or not ?			1

one writer calls the episode " *brutally* *honest* "
