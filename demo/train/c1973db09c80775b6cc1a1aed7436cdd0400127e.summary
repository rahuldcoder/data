-- as the november 24 deadline for a deal over @entity5 's nuclear program approaches , @entity1 seems fixated on the technical details of what an agreement should look like : the types of centrifuges @entity5 might be able to keep , for example , or the level of low - enriched uranium it could stockpile			1
but as important as these discussions are , the focus on mechanics risks missing a bigger and arguably more important reality : that the negotiations are central to the future of @entity5 's political system			2
the failure to address this crucial question could come back to haunt us			0
if the @entity25 is serious not just about placing significant ( if imperfect ) limits on @entity5 's nuclear program , but also encouraging a political dynamic that strengthens reform - minded @entity5 leaders and fosters a more cooperative @entity5 foreign policy abroad , then @entity1 should make every reasonable effort to seal a comprehensive nuclear deal and secure @entity33 ' support for it			1
the alternative -- insisting on imposing onerous terms that would virtually assure @entity5 's quitting the negotiations -- would simply bolster @entity5 's hard - liners , while making it far easier for @entity38 to pursue a nuclear program largely free of international supervision			1
to turn the popular @entity1 refrain on its head , no agreement is far worse than a mutually agreeable if imperfect agreement			0
the reality is that ultra-hard - liners in @entity5 have always feared that the narrowest of openings could eventually create a flood of political change			2
from the outset they tried to stir up trouble for @entity5 president @entity53 and his allies , and have no doubt been preparing to escalate their efforts if and when supreme leader @entity57 should signal that negotiations are fruitless			0
indeed , @entity53 's opponents appear to want the talks to collapse in hopes of extinguishing hope the reformist movement will be able to make a comeback in the 2016 parliamentary elections			0
a consideration of such internal political struggles might surprise some commentators and lawmakers in @entity1 , where many have embraced the dubious notion that there is no fundamental difference of opinion between @entity38 's hard - liners and those @entity5 leaders now engaged in a potentially risky struggle to redefine the political and ideological leadership of the @entity79			1
should such calculations have any bearing on the positions of @entity25 negotiators ? of course , their chief mission is to concentrate on the intricate technical issues that must still be sorted through to reach a deal			2
but policy makers should also not ignore the wider political questions that are at stake here			2
to insist on positions that might pacify the most zealous @entity25 opponents of an agreement but which would discredit @entity53 and his domestic allies would do grave damage to long - term @entity25 interests			2
what we should do instead is reach for an agreement that narrows the parameters of @entity5 's nuclear program while helping to create conditions favorable to broader political debate in @entity5			1
striving for this sweet spot may be difficult , but it is better than the alternatives			0
a collapse of negotiations might not produce an immediate political calamity for @entity53			0
but in the medium and long term it will surely bolster @entity38 's hard - liners , who will argue that @entity5 's only choice is to circle the wagons by strengthening the " resistance " economy , by working with @entity119 , @entity120 and other small and large autocracies seeking to counter @entity25 " hegemony , " and by silencing any domestic voices that might oppose these hard - line policies			1
moreover , failed negotiations would anyway give hard - liners a victory by making it impossible for the @entity25 to secure long - term international monitoring of , and safeguards on , @entity5 's nuclear program -- @entity5 leaders could declare that @entity38 has permanently given up enriching 20 % uranium , while assuring the international community that it will limit low - enriched uranium purely for purposes of domestic energy " needs			1
" such a @entity138 could erode the international consensus over sanctions , leaving the @entity25 with no good options and @entity5 's hard - liners sitting pretty			1
and what of the other alternatives ? history clearly shows that sanctions can get @entity38 to the negotiating table , but will not compel @entity5 leaders to capitulate to demands they deem contrary to @entity5 interests			0
as for military action , the consensus among @entity25 military leaders and strategists seems to be that any effort to significantly damage or reverse @entity5 's nuclear program would require weeks or months of sustained bombing -- in effect another war , the outcome of which would be far from certain			1
and , with the @entity161 on the march , the last thing the @entity25 should be thinking about doing is adding to the regional chaos			0
given that the strategic and political price of failure has risen dramatically , what is most needed now from both @entity38 and @entity1 is a readiness to secure compromises that could ultimately have a positive impact on reshaping the course of @entity5 politics			0
if there was ever a time for bold and visionary leadership on both sides , that time is now .			0
