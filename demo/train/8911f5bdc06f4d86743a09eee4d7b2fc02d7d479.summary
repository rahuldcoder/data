@entity0 , @entity1 -- hundreds of runners braved their luck wednesday on the first day of the annual running of the bulls in @entity9 -- but just two men , an @entity11 and a @entity12 , were taken to hospital afterward with injuries , the @entity4 regional government said			1
it was considered a thrilling but safe start to the annual tradition in @entity9 , which has tallied 14 deaths since record - keeping began in 1924 , including the fatal goring of a @entity1 man last year , and thousands of injuries			0
the run in @entity9 started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author @entity23 wrote about it in the 1920s in his book " @entity27 , " also published under the title " @entity27			0
" it is now broadcast live across @entity1 by state television @entity30 , which estimated there were more than a thousand runners			0
an 18 - year - old @entity11 man from @entity34 was taken to hospital with various injuries sustained on the narrow street that descends into the bullring			0
and a @entity1 man , 20 , from @entity40 also went to hospital with an eye injury sustained on a street almost halfway through the run , the @entity4 regional government said on its website			1
both were initially listed in stable condition but under close observation , the website said			0
it took the six bulls and a pack of tame steers , which help guide the bulls , a full 17 seconds to emerge from the corrals after the opening rocket was fired to signal the start of the run			2
but the pack then moved swiftly through the cobblestone streets of old @entity9 along the 825 - meter ( 902 - yard ) course to the bullring , where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight			0
the run lasted just 2 minutes and 23 seconds and the bull and steer pack stayed mainly together , which long - time observers say usually means a safer run -- unlike when a bull or bulls get separated , frightened and may charge directly into the runners			1
television images showed mostly men dressed in the traditional white outfits with red handkerchiefs , but also a small number of women , and even one man with a football helmet , which is prohibited but was apparently not noticed by the hundreds of police officers who eject , before the run , people carrying cameras or who are drunk			2
the aim is safety , so that runners can focus on the run			2
television images showed numerous runners making hard falls to the pavement , tripping over other runners or colliding with the bulls			1
the daily run continues for eight days , through july 14 , at 8 a.m. ( 2 a.m. et ) , and is the highlight of the @entity99 in @entity9 that attracts hundreds of thousands to the non-stop fiesta .			1
