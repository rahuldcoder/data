-- federal terrorism charges against @entity5 bombings suspect @entity6 could be filed soon , even as he remains hospitalized , a @entity2 official told @entity0 on saturday			1
the 19 - year - old could also face murder charges at the state level			2
at the @entity11 , where @entity6 was in serious condition while being held in federal custody , federal prosecutors were formulating the charges			1
the development came amid questions as to what 's next for the suspect in the @entity5 bombings			2
president @entity19 said he 's keenly interested in answers			2
" there are still many unanswered questions , " @entity19 said friday night			0
" why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence ? how did they plan and carry out these attacks ? and did they receive any help ? the families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers			0
" @entity6 and his older brother , @entity36 , are accused of setting off bombs at the marathon monday , killing three people and wounding more than 170			1
on thursday night , they allegedly killed a @entity42 police officer before the older brother was killed during a shootout with police			0
@entity6 was captured friday night after he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in @entity48 , @entity49			1
when will the suspect be in court ? @entity6 could be in a courtroom for an arraignment soon			1
ordinarily at an arraignment , the suspect is provided a lawyer , and the defense and prosecution try to make a case for whether he should be released on bail			1
" he will not get bail obviously , " said senior legal analyst @entity61			0
" they will set a preliminary hearing that could happen in the next 30 days			0
he will be indicted with the grand jury			0
and that 's when the case will begin			0
" after the charges are filed , the @entity69 in @entity70 will be appointed to represent @entity6 , according to @entity72 , the federal public defender for the @entity49 district			1
should bomber suspect be questioned without a lawyer ? for now , the government is invoking the public safety exception , a designation that allows investigators to question @entity6 without reading him his @entity82 rights , a @entity2 official told @entity0 on condition of anonymity			1
in ordinary cases , a suspect is told by police he has the right to remain silent and he has the right to a lawyer			1
but this is not an ordinary case , say @entity93 sens. @entity93 and @entity94			0
they urged that @entity6 be held as an " enemy combatant , " a designation that allows a suspect to be questioned without a lawyer and without being informed of his @entity82 rights			1
" now that the suspect is in custody , the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent			2
it is absolutely vital the suspect be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes , " the senators said			1
" under the law of war we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to @entity82 warnings or the appointment of counsel			2
" but sen. @entity115 , @entity116 , chairman of the @entity117 , said saturday that the suspect should not be held as an enemy combatant			2
" i am not aware of any evidence so far that the @entity70 suspect is part of any organized group , let alone @entity124 , the @entity125 , or one of their affiliates -- the only organizations whose members are subject to detention under the @entity131 , as it has been consistently interpreted by all three branches of our government , " he said			1
" in the absence of such evidence i know of no legal basis for his detention as an enemy combatant			0
to hold the suspect as an enemy combatant under these circumstances would be contrary to our laws and may even jeopardize our efforts to prosecute him for his crimes			2
" @entity148 , a prominent defense attorney and @entity150 law professor , scoffed at the @entity153 senators ' statement			2
there 's no way an @entity159 citizen committing a domestic crime in the city of @entity70 could be tried as an enemy combatant , " he told @entity0 's @entity155			1
" it could never happen			0
and that shows absolute ignorance of the law			0
" @entity148 also said statements made by police in @entity70 seems to contradict the government 's reasons for invoking the public safety exception			1
" the police have said there 's no public safety issue ; it 's solved , it 's over , " @entity148 said			2
" there are no further threats			0
but the @entity177 is saying there 's enough further threats to justify an exception			0
" former @entity182 mayor @entity181 said the federal government may have known about international threats about which state officials were not aware			2
" you would have to know the internals of what they have before you can assess whether there is a sensible invocation or not , " @entity181 said			0
if the government had prior knowledge of @entity6 's activities , it has n't disclosed it			1
it did say that @entity36 had been on the @entity177 's radar in the past			0
@entity177 agents interviewed @entity36 two years ago and also looked at his travel history , checked databases for derogatory information and searched for web postings			0
the agency found no connection with terror groups , an @entity177 official told @entity0			0
two key republicans on the @entity209 -- rep. @entity210 of @entity211 , the panel 's chairman ; and rep. @entity214 -- will press the @entity19 administration for details about the @entity177 's questioning of @entity36 , according to a @entity153 congressional source			2
@entity36 , who was not a @entity159 citizen , traveled to @entity220 , @entity221 , in january 2012 , according to travel records provided by a @entity159 official			1
he returned six months later			0
federal or state trial ? @entity148 said there are many arguments that can be made to try the case in state court			1
it may be hard for a prosecutor to prove which crimes were committed by @entity6 or his older brother , @entity148 said			1
" if he says my intent was to please my brother , they could raise the question of federal jurisdiction , " @entity148 said			0
this fight over federal or state jurisdiction could mean life or death			0
@entity49 does not have the death penalty			0
there 's another big question : the @entity246 of 2012 requires temporary military custody of certain terrorist suspects , but @entity6 is a @entity159 citizen , and the act does n't apply to @entity159			1
what is the reaction in the suspects ' homeland ? @entity6 's family lives in the @entity221 republic of @entity256 , which is next to the suspects ' homeland of @entity259 , located in the @entity261 region of southern @entity221			1
@entity221 's investigative committee in @entity256 said it will not engage with the @entity6 family unless there is " an order from above " to do so , spokesman @entity266 told @entity221 state news agency @entity267 on saturday			1
a spokesman for @entity221 president @entity269 said saturday that @entity221 wants to get official information from the @entity159 about the bombing suspects , and he wants there to be contact between investigators in both countries			1
@entity0 's @entity275 and @entity276 contributed to this report .			0
