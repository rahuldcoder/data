-- @entity1 heads in to @entity3 's presidential primary this week with a handy win in @entity5 , pocketing the territory 's 20 @entity7 delegates in a bruising race that has become a numbers game for the @entity7 nomination			1
with about 83 % of total ballots accounted for early monday in @entity5 , @entity1 had garnered more than 98,000 votes -- or 83 % of the total -- based on unofficial results obtained from local party and election officials			1
@entity18 was a distant second , at 8 % with slightly more than 9,500 votes			2
the other two candidates , former house speaker @entity22 and @entity24 rep. @entity23 , were barely registered in the race with 2,431 votes , or 2 % of the vote , and 1,452 votes , or 1 % , respectively			2
even as the vote was being counted in @entity5 , @entity1 , @entity18 and the other candidates were already on the mainland vying for delegates in @entity3 and @entity33			1
@entity3 holds its primary on tuesday and @entity33 on saturday			1
@entity0 's latest delegate estimates show @entity1 with 518 delegates to @entity18 's 239			1
@entity37 has 139 delegates , and @entity23 , the libertarian champion , has 69 delegates			0
to secure the nomination , 1,144 delegates are needed			0
@entity18 , the former @entity42 senator , was in @entity33 late sunday , where he is expected to win the primary			1
@entity1 was in @entity3 where polls indicate he holds a small lead over @entity18 , with @entity37 and @entity23 well behind			1
@entity1 framed his win in @entity5 as the territory 's desire for a candidate that " most represents their feelings " -- and especially their desire to nominate some who can bring about a stronger economy and a smaller government			1
he also said his party can appeal to @entity58 , and win the presidency , with a low - tax , pro-business message			0
" those people who do n't think that @entity58 will vote for a @entity7 need to take a look in @entity5 , " said the former @entity62 governor , noting that the territory 's governor and its legislative leaders are conservative			2
" hispanic voters are going to vote for republicans if we stand for something -- conservative principles that bring growth and good jobs and rising home values			0
that 's how we 're going to win , and we 're going to get @entity78 voters to help us out			0
" @entity1 had entered the contest in @entity5 as the favorite			1
he was largely backed by the island government 's political establishment , including gov. @entity83 , who campaigned with @entity1 last week			2
@entity18 , the former @entity42 senator , created a small political firestorm on the island in the days leading up to the primary when he said @entity87 should be the principal language in @entity5 before it could gain statehood			1
@entity5 will vote on a statehood referendum in november			0
after arriving in @entity5 on friday , @entity1 said he would have " no preconditions " on language for @entity5 to gain statehood , though during a @entity0 debate in january he said @entity87 should be the nation 's official language			1
@entity18 immediately hit back , accusing @entity1 of flip - flopping			1
@entity1 fired back that @entity87 has been the official language of the government in @entity5 for more than 100 years			1
the heated , see - saw allegations between the two candidates have marked much of the race for the @entity7 nomination , which sen. @entity104 , @entity105 , called " the nastiest i 've ever seen " during an appearance sunday on @entity108 's " @entity107			0
" @entity5 's primary came two days before the showdown in @entity3 , where 54 delegates will be awarded proportionally and polls show a tight race between @entity1 and @entity18			1
asked over the weekend while campaigning in @entity114 about whether a win in @entity3 would mean he 'd win the nomination , @entity18 said : " we feel very , very good about it			2
let 's put it that way			0
" @entity18 also challenged @entity1 's assertion that his business experience is one of his strongest credentials , telling @entity0 's @entity127 on " @entity128 " on sunday that , " if gov. @entity1 thinks that he is the ceo of @entity130 and can run and manage the economy , he does n't understand what conservatives believe in			1
" @entity1 's campaign released an ad in @entity3 on friday , attacking @entity18 for having " never run a business or a state			1
" @entity18 on sunday said he had experience in the private sector as a lawyer , but argued that executive experience at a company is not necessary to be commander - in - chief			0
" running a business is not the same as being president of the @entity130 , " he said			0
@entity18 also gave no indication that he has plans to drop out of the race should his campaign reach a point where the delegate math does n't add up in his favor			0
" what i 'm hearing is that we want a conservative nominee , that the establishment is trying to push a moderate like they did in 1976 against @entity158 , like they did in 1996 with @entity160 and what they did with @entity104 , " @entity18 said			0
" i think conservatives would like an opportunity to nominate a conservative , and that 's an opportunity			0
" both @entity18 and @entity1 also focused their rhetoric at president @entity168 , particularly with regard to rising gas prices			2
@entity1 said @entity168 needed to fire secretary of energy @entity171 and interior secretary @entity173 for their role in driving up gas prices			0
" given the fact that ( @entity168 has ) changed his policies , wants lower gas prices , he needs to fire them and return to the energy policies we need , " @entity1 said during a town hall meeting in @entity178 , @entity3			2
@entity18 told a crowd in @entity186 , @entity3 , to remember @entity168 at the gas pumps			2
" when you see that zero come up , when it gets to the $ 100 range , when you see the zero , think of ' o ' for @entity168 because that 's why you are paying that extra amount of money , " @entity18 said			0
