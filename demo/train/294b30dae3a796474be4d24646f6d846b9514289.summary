-- pet owners know that their furry friends can add a little something extra to the spring cleaning chores			1
@entity0 spoke with " the @entity5 , " @entity6 , a @entity7 best - selling author and television personality			2
@entity6 , who owns three cats , knows a thing or two about getting the best of pet messes			1
@entity0 : what can pet owners do about pet hair ? @entity6 : you can use what 's called a soot and dirt removal sponge			1
you simply run it over a lampshade [ or the ] upholstery on your furniture , and it actually pulls the hair right off			1
you can also use a damp sponge			2
another good thing to use is rubber gloves			1
dip them into water -- keep a bucket of water near you -- shake off the excess water and rub that over the upholstery , and the hair will collect on the rubber gloves			1
it does a great , great job			2
the other thing you need is a really good vacuum cleaner			2
i have found that i prefer one that has a bag in it			2
if you 're using a canister vacuum , you have to take it out and then shake it into the trash , which puts all of that dust and that dander and that cat hair and everything else back up into the air			1
another good vacuum that is newer to the market is the @entity60 [ @entity61 ]			0
that 's the one with the ultraviolet light that kills germs and bacteria as you vacuum			0
now , you have to vacuum correctly and go back over the area of the carpet enough times , but that 's a very good vacuum too			0
if you have someone in the house that is sensitive to cats , has an allergy from them or something like that , there is a product called @entity80 that you can actually just spray on to your pet , and it neutralizes the enzymes in the saliva , which is what people are usually allergic to			1
this is something that even if the cat licks itself , it wo n't hurt it			1
@entity0 : what about pet accidents ? @entity6 : if you 've got a hairball , or spaghetti did n't agree with the dog , accident on the carpet , the first thing you do is scream and run to get the paper towels and start trying to pick it up , which drives it down into the carpet fibers			1
instead , reach for your baking soda			1
sprinkle on a really heavy coat , and i mean heavy , so that it 's completely covering it totally			0
the baking soda will pull the liquid , the bile , the acids from the accident up into it away from the carpet			1
once it 's dry , you take the suction hose from your vacuum and simply vacuum that up , and many times you ca n't even tell there was an accident there			0
for pet urine , the first thing you want to do is put a very heavy , heavy pile of paper towels on it , stand on it , draw all the urine you can away from the carpet			1
then pour on club soda and do the same thing			1
then you can go in to neutralize it with about a half a cup of water quarter cup of white vinegar			0
[ then ] blot that dry			0
if you have any odor , you want to use an odor eliminator to remove that			0
now , that 's not a spray that smells like lavender or oranges or flowers			1
an odor eliminator has no odor			0
a really , really fine one is @entity149			0
it 's all - natural , so it ca n't hurt the pet			1
the man who invented it powdered his grandson 's little butt with it when he changed his diaper , that 's how natural it is			1
if there 's a larger accident and you have a bowel movement on the floor , as long as it 's not diarrhea - like , you can pick that up with a paper towel			0
i recommend that you immediately treat that with @entity149 , because if your pets can smell what they 've done , they 'll go back to that area because they think it 's ok			1
@entity0 : what about the litter box ? @entity6 : cats like to be very , very clean , so to avoid having accidents in other areas because their litter 's dirty , you want to clean every day			1
if you 're using a regular litter box , there is a product called a @entity185 ; it 's a little sanitary container for the [ waste ] removal			0
it 's a fantastic product			0
i use it for my cats , and i just love it			2
now , if you 're using [ an automatic cleaner ] , every few days , you need to make sure that the catch basin is cleaned out			0
if it overfills and the cat smells that , they do n't want to go in , and then they 're going to start using corners of your house			2
and you know what ? that 's not their fault			0
that 's our fault if we do n't keep their litter clean			0
@entity0 : how do you keep your pets safe when you 're doing a big spring cleaning ? @entity6 : well , you look for natural products			1
do n't use harsh chemicals ; it 's not necessary			0
disinfectants have to stay wet on the surfaces for five to 10 minutes to work ; then they have to be rinsed off			2
they 're not safe for food surfaces			0
you know what that says ? they 're not safe for your pets to walk on , either			2
read when you go to the grocery store			0
if there 's a natural seal or if they have a green cross on it , they 're a natural , safe , organic product			2
i recommend so highly the @entity237 products from @entity238 , the cloths and the mops			2
because with nothing but water , they remove 99.9 percent of germs and bacteria and soiling from surfaces			0
you 're not getting any residue on surfaces , and you 're not spending any money on chemicals , and you 're saving the environment and your health too .			0
