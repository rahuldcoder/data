one year ago , @entity0 , the former @entity1 presidential contender and avatar of progressive sentiment , sat in a hotel lobby at the annual @entity6 conference in @entity7 and held forth on @entity10 's @entity9 chances in 2016			1
@entity18 " will not get a pass " in the 2016 @entity1 primaries if she decides to run again , @entity0 said , an early warning shot from the left against the party establishment 's anointed front - runner			1
@entity0 said he might make a repeat @entity9 bid of his own , promising to agitate " other politicians " in the race on issues precious to liberals			1
stepping up her game , @entity18 agrees to help in midterms how things have changed			1
today , @entity0 still thinks @entity18 will have a challenger in the @entity1 field -- maybe several			1
but he wo n't be one of them			0
and if @entity18 does run , @entity0 sounds like he 's ready to join the team			1
" i am a huge @entity10 fan , " @entity0 told @entity36 in an interview			1
not because i hope to get a job			0
i know her ; i 've known her for a long time			0
i think she has an enormous mental capacity to do analysis and let the chips fall where they may			0
" " if she is president , which i hope she is , i think she is going to be a terrific president , " added @entity0 , who stopped into @entity18 's book signing event in the @entity46 last weekend and posed for a picture with the former secretary of state			1
the kind words from @entity0 are n't quite an endorsement in the traditional campaign sense , but praise from one of the left 's most recognizable figures is sure to please @entity18 allies who are working to build up an aura of inevitability around her and blunt a serious primary challenge			1
the @entity64 has already secured pseudo-endorsements from @entity67 sen. @entity66 and @entity69 's two senators , @entity70 and @entity71			0
opinion : can @entity10 win over the left ? @entity18 's incremental politics do n't quite square with those of @entity0 , who rose to national prominence in 2004 as a fierce and noisy critic of the war in @entity79 , a military action supported by @entity18			1
while @entity18 is not the cold - blooded foreign policy hawk she 's often caricatured as -- she 's a devotee of so - called " smart power " and institution - building -- her @entity79 war vote in 2002 and her occasional splits with president @entity88 on @entity89 and @entity90 have not endeared her to her party 's anti-interventionist wing			1
her differences with @entity88 resurfaced last week in an interview with the @entity98 's @entity97			0
@entity18 drew a line between her own views and the president 's cautious foreign policy realism , expressing concern over the administration 's handling of the civil war in @entity89			2
she said , " great nations need organizing principles -- and ' do n't do stupid stuff ' is not an organizing principle			0
" the remark ricocheted around the @entity113 , and @entity18 called the president to make amends			2
@entity0 , though , aggressively took @entity18 's side			1
" how can she not triangulate ? she is running for @entity120 , " the former @entity119 governor said			1
" you think if she comes out as a clone of anybody she has any chance at winning ? people do n't want clones as president			0
so of course she is going to say stuff that 's different			0
so what ? this is news ? " his aggressive defense of @entity18 bloomed into a lengthy rant against the state of the political news media and the " amplification chamber " that @entity18 will have to navigate if she decides to run			2
@entity18 dances between loyalty and self - interest " i find all that to be worthless , " @entity0 said			1
" i do n't pay any attention to that crap			0
i was at a meeting in @entity146 the other day with two very high - ranking people who i wo n't mention , and one turned to the other and said , ' did you see that editorial in the @entity152 ? ' and without being cranky , and without saying anything , i said to myself , ' you 're a free man			0
' because why would anyone read the @entity152 , or certainly the editorial page of the @entity152 ? " i just do n't have any patience for this @entity158 that goes on in what passes for media these days			0
i really do n't read most of the stuff that 's written about inside the @entity163 kerfuffles like that because i think it 's silly			0
" @entity18 's biggest challenge will be generational , @entity0 said , echoing a previous observation he 's made about the putative @entity1 front - runner			1
@entity18 is 14 years older than @entity88 and would be 69 on @entity169 2017			2
" @entity10 , she has been on the scene since , what , 1992 ? " he said			2
" to elect @entity10 , the country would have to do something we 've only done once in my lifetime , with @entity177 over @entity178 , which is the country would have to go back a generation			2
usually , you do n't go back			0
" still , he said @entity18 " might be a great candidate because of that			2
" " it 's fairly likely the @entity186 are going to nominate somebody who is going to be considered pretty flawed , " he said , handicapping the @entity186 field			1
gap shrinks between @entity10 and @entity186 @entity0 called @entity190 and @entity192 " the wing - nut brothers			1
" @entity18 , he said , would be a " perfect foil " for @entity192 , who is , in his words , " a guy who wants to turn back the clock to the 1840s and all this other crap and pretend he is a libertarian but does n't want women to exercise any rights over their own lives			1
she is going to mop the floor with him			2
" " if it 's @entity208 , people are going to look at @entity209 and @entity210 and all that stuff and go , ' why not join with a safe person who is a proven commodity ? ' ' @entity206 ' is not a proven commodity			0
the only candidate that i would be concerned about is @entity215 , but then you get more of the same , and how is he going to denounce his brother 's presidency ? " he said			0
as for the potential @entity1 field , @entity0 said @entity18 will not be " an acclamation candidate " and predicted that " there 's going to be opposition , and it 's not going to be lightweight opposition			1
" he gushed over @entity225 sen. @entity224 , who professes to have no interest in running , and @entity228 gov. @entity227 , who increasingly seems likely to jump in the race			0
@entity230 , he said , is " new and refreshing " and " incredibly straightforward			0
" @entity0 said he is " a big fan " of @entity227 and said he would make a name for himself if he runs			1
" i have spoken to him about this , " @entity0 said			2
" he came to see me about it a year ago			0
he is a very solid guy who has done a terrific job as governor			0
i like the way he thinks , and i like the way he approaches problems and gets things done			0
but @entity10 has 100 % name recognition and huge favorability numbers			1
it 's a very uphill climb for somebody who wants to run against her			1
" @entity18 , he said , " is best prepared " though he wants to " see who her campaign team is " before deciding if he will formally endorse her			2
" i have not seen anything that alarms me about @entity10 at all , " he said			2
" i actually thought the @entity253 interview , minus the remark about ' we were broke when we left the @entity9 , ' was a great intro for her , because it showed her as her own person with the positives and the negatives			0
" she could get elected without being her own person , but if she wants to get elected with real mandate , she has to be herself			0

" i am a huge @entity10 fan , " former @entity119 governor and @entity266 chairman says
handicapping 2016 @entity186 field , @entity0 says @entity18 would " mop the floor " with @entity192
@entity0 says anyone who runs against @entity18 will have an " uphill climb "
