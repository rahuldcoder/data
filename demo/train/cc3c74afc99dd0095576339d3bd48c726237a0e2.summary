-- @entity2 - inspired suspenders may have faded from @entity3 and lunch is n't for wimps anymore , but if there 's one thing that has n't changed in the last two decades it 's this : greed is good			1
with his new film director @entity10 is back to exposing financial chicanery , this time showcasing how complex and unfettered the system has become since his 1987 hit film " @entity3			1
" what did he find when he returned to the scene after more than two decades ? after years of bank deregulation , @entity3 " got ridiculous , and i mean it 's insane			1
it became a financial casino , " he told @entity0			0
that outrageous environment serves as the backdrop for " @entity3 2 : @entity22 , " a follow - up film which , amid massive bank bailouts , sweeping financial reform in @entity25 and investigations into the practices of @entity3 's leading firms , could n't be more timely			1
in the movie , @entity30 reprises the role of corporate shark @entity2			1
fresh out of prison , he finds himself in a new financial era dominated by complex products and securities			0
" @entity22 , " which is slated for release in september , is a " bookend " rather than a sequel , to the 1987 film , @entity10 says			1
@entity10 , whose father worked on @entity3 as a broker , set out to tell a morality tale about excess in the original film , with @entity2 positioned as the bad guy			1
but judging by the recent financial crisis , not many @entity47 took @entity10 's message to heart			1
instead of being seen as a villain in the 1980s , @entity2 became a paragon of success for a generation of traders and business school graduates			2
@entity30 , who won a @entity57 for the first " @entity3 , " said he 's always surprised at the reaction @entity60 students have to @entity2 , the suspender - sporting character out to win at all costs			1
" they would come up to me and say , ' @entity67 , he 's the man , ' " he told @entity0 at @entity63 , where the film premiered earlier this month			2
" and probably a lot of those guys ... are heading up investing banking companies now , " he said			0
in the follow up film , @entity2 is looking to get back into the @entity3 game and finds a way through his estranged daughter 's boyfriend , a young investment banker played by @entity76			1
joining the cast , which includes @entity78 and @entity79 , was like " stepping into a cage of lions , " @entity76 said			2
" i felt like an underdog coming onto this set			0
i 'm the ' transformers , ' kid			0
it 's just like , it 's daunting			0
" @entity76 and @entity88 , who plays @entity2 's daughter , play a young couple with ideals			1
( the couple has also been linked together offscreen			0
) but their integrity is tested and " everybody has double motives , " @entity10 said			2
a director known for offering provocative viewpoints , particularly in political films like " @entity99 , " " @entity100 " and " @entity101 " -- his next film , " @entity103 , " is about @entity105 leader @entity104 -- @entity10 initially was n't interested in telling another story about @entity3			1
when the producer of the original film and @entity109 made a deal for a follow up film , @entity10 was n't on board			1
" i did n't event want to do a sequel and i turned them down , " he said			0
what changed ? the financial meltdown of 2008 , which unleashed the worst crisis since the @entity119 and caused the economy to suffer in @entity10 's words , a " triple bypass heart attack			1
" the financial crisis " was an event of monumental importance socially , economically , for the @entity125 , " he said			0
" it was n't a perfect storm , it was a systematic breakdown that was due because it 's the way the system is run			2
" while the director certainly harbors strong feelings about the financial system , he also had his fun with the film			0
he appears briefly , as does @entity135 , who played @entity2 's protégé @entity136 in the first film			2
" i was having fun , you have to have fun , " @entity10 said			0
just like the original " @entity3 , " " you have to take this with a grain of salt because it 's so depressing otherwise			2
" @entity88 says the film is first and foremost an entertaining story			0
" it 's really about people enjoying it as a movie , " she told @entity0			0
" because it 's not just a lesson in finance , it 's love stories and rivalries and a brilliant villain in the middle of it			0
