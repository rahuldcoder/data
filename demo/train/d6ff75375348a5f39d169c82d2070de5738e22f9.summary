-- @entity1 is @entity2 's most successful conductor , a maestro in a quintessentially @entity5 art form , and a die - hard @entity7 fan			1
but the affable 74 - year - old is used to crossing cultural boundaries			1
born in @entity11 during the @entity13 occupation - his father a @entity15 , his mother a @entity17 - he was raised in @entity18 , and greatly influenced by western culture and a @entity21 upbringing			1
his love of music was first explored through the church , but later he studied at the @entity25 in @entity18			1
a career as a pianist was curtailed when the 16 - year - old sports - loving @entity1 broke two fingers during a rugby match			1
from @entity25 he traveled to @entity31 and @entity32 to further his studies			2
it was a steep learning curve where he learnt how to deal first - hand with other cultures and prejudices			1
" i have many problem , beginning			2
. maybe now , i do n't know , but beginning especially			2
some people ask me , ' you came from @entity41 , you came from @entity13 , do you really understand @entity42 or do you really understand @entity43 ? ' " he told @entity0			2
after years abroad , his return to @entity13 in 1962 to conduct the @entity46 for six months was far from a happy homecoming ; the orchestra rebelled and refused to play for him			1
" i made mistake , and i think it was too soon [ for me ] to take a professional orchestra for six months and at the end i think they had enough			2
" i think i was a little bit stuck up ... i mean , i was conducting the best orchestra in @entity13 already i 'm still 26 or 27			0
and i think i 'm sure during rehearsal i say something not so nice			0
and in @entity13 very bad if conductor say something not so nice			0
but i learned , so i become more careful and i think i started more studying , so not make mistake			0
" but in a way , it may sound very strange , but really it did me good that boycott			0
" it meant @entity1 explored opportunities outside of @entity13 , directing festivals and orchestras across @entity31 , @entity67 and the @entity68 he became musical director of the @entity70 a post he held for 29 years until 2004			1
he left @entity72 for @entity73 to embrace a new challenge with the @entity75			0
as well as the challenge of a new city and repertory , @entity1 believes it was a move that rounded out his musical education , even if he was 68 - years - old at the time			1
when a young conductor his interest in opera had been fostered by his early tutor @entity85			0
" he said if you do n't study this , one half of @entity43 you 'll never touch and almost 99 percent of @entity89 , almost 100 percent of @entity90 and @entity91 , you know , half of @entity43 is gone			0
" while @entity1 will step down from his position at the @entity75 next summer , he will remain active in directing , conducting and educating the next generation in classical music			1
" i have big hope all @entity101 people and countries ... everybody love music basically , " he said			0
" teaching has become , i think , more and more important my life , really			0

@entity1 was musical director of @entity70 for 29 years
successful career has seen @entity1 conduct some of world 's greatest orchestras
