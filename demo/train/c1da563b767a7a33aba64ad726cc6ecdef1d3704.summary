the abduction of a @entity2 family , including four children , in a remote part of @entity5 has fueled fears that @entity8 civilians living and working in parts of @entity10 are becoming targets of @entity13 militant groups -- especially in the wake of @entity2 's military intervention in @entity16			1
the family spent monday at @entity18 -- a thickly - forested area popular with tourists close to the borders with @entity22 and @entity23			2
tuesday morning , they began the drive south when they were ambushed and abducted by several armed men on motorbikes , officials said			0
the children 's father is an employee of the @entity2 company @entity30 and is based in @entity31 , in the south of @entity5			1
@entity30 , which is developing a natural gas liquefaction project in @entity5 , expressed its concern and said it was working closely with the @entity35			2
@entity18 is in a remote part of the country where the borders are porous and criminal and terrorist groups are able to operate freely , according to regional analysts			2
@entity2 officials immediately pointed the finger at the @entity22 group @entity44 , which has waged a three - year terror campaign against @entity46 in northern @entity22 as well as attacking police stations and more moderate @entity48 in authority			1
it has also been able to take advantage of porous borders with @entity23 and @entity5			0
@entity2 president @entity53 said during a visit to @entity55 on tuesday : " i am aware of the presence of @entity44 in that part of @entity5 , and that 's worrying enough			1
" @entity53 said he does not believe that the kidnapping took place because of his country 's intervention in @entity16			0
" there is a great danger of terrorism in a big part of @entity10 , including as far as @entity5 , " said @entity53 , calling on @entity2 nationals to exercise caution in @entity10			1
@entity53 said it was likely the kidnappers planned to take the family of seven across the border into @entity22 and said @entity2 would do everything possible to prevent that			1
but , in this remote area , @entity2 options are limited			0
throughout @entity10 and the @entity77 , @entity8 have become targets for both militant groups and criminal gangs , which are sometimes indistinguishable			1
altogether , 15 @entity2 citizens are now being held by various groups in the region , six of them by groups aligned with @entity85			2
some 6,000 @entity2 citizens live in @entity5 , part of which was once a @entity2 colony			1
in december , @entity89 , a @entity2 engineer working in the northern @entity22 state of @entity91 , was kidnapped by a jihadist group calling itself @entity93			1
and on sunday , @entity94 , as it 's also known , launched a much more ambitious operation in @entity90 , kidnapping seven foreign contractors working on a construction project in response to the " transgression and atrocities done to the religion of @entity103 by @entity105 countries in places such as @entity107 and @entity16			0
" @entity44 has links with some of the @entity13 militant factions in @entity16 , and there have been persistent reports that fighters from the group had joined jihadist camps around the city of @entity116 , which until this month was under the control of a group associated with @entity85 ( @entity85 )			0
last year , @entity119 , who leads the @entity120			0
said " linkages between @entity85 and @entity44 are probably the most worrisome in terms of the indications we have that they are likely sharing funds , training and explosive materials			0
" more recently , @entity119 said the @entity128 had begun feeding intelligence about the group to the @entity22 military			0
@entity132 , a former @entity133 ambassador in @entity22 now with the @entity134 , said last month that if @entity44 really had developed links with @entity85 " it would seem likely that @entity44 will escalate their attacks in northern @entity22 in solidarity with their @entity139 brothers			1
if that happens , there will be yet more pressure on the already overstretched @entity22 forces			0
" @entity22 is leading a group of @entity10 countries supporting the @entity2 mission in @entity22 , further straining its ability to deal with @entity139 extremism at home			1
@entity132 told @entity151 on tuesday that until there was some claim of responsibility , it was difficult to be sure that the abduction in @entity5 had a political dimension			0
kidnapping has become a lucrative business in parts of @entity10			0
@entity132 also noted that while @entity94 has been quick to claim responsibility for its previous actions , @entity44 had been largely silent in recent months			2
the relationship between the two is unclear , according to analysts of jihadist groups in @entity10			0
both @entity44 and @entity94 first emerged in the northern @entity22 city of @entity168			1
@entity169 , who has followed the evolution of both groups , says @entity94 broke away from @entity44 a year ago and " has since become known for its similarities and suspected links to @entity85 and allied groups such as the @entity176 in @entity10 ( @entity177 )			1
" @entity94 has taken a more hostile attitude toward @entity2			2
it said the abduction of @entity181 was in response to the @entity2 government 's stance on @entity139 -- including the ban on the wearing of the veil in public and in @entity2 schools			0
@entity44 is more focused on what it sees as discrimination against @entity48 in @entity22			2
recently , like the @entity194 @entity193 , it has extended its attacks to target doctors and health workers involved in polio vaccinations			0
the emergence of two apparently resilient terror groups in northern @entity22 , and the surge in attacks on foreigners , pose growing challenges for a government and military already struggling to exert their authority across large areas of @entity10 's most populous nation .			1
