the @entity0 on tuesday will confront its biggest case of the term so far , another high - profile challenge to affirmative action in college admissions			1
the planned hour of oral arguments raises anew thorny , unresolved questions over race and remedies			1
the justices are being asked to decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in @entity14 banning race - and sex - based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions			1
the high court just 16 weeks ago affirmed the use of race at the @entity22 , but made it harder for institutions to justify such policies to achieve diversity			2
in that dispute , a white student said the college 's existing affirmative action policy violated her " equal protection " rights , while civil rights supporters of such programs claim @entity14 's ban also has the same effect			1
a federal appeals court last year concluded the affirmative action ban , which @entity14 voters passed in a 2006 referendum , violated the @entity43 @entity42 's equal protection guarantees			1
it was the latest step in a legal and political battle over whether state colleges can use race and gender as a factor in choosing which students to admit			2
" the question before the @entity0 is whether you can have a constitutional amendment enacted by the people of a state that prevents the legislature from adopting affirmative action , " said @entity51 , publisher of @entity52 and a prominent @entity54 attorney			1
" is that a form of discrimination against minorities , or is it actually an implementation of a colorblind @entity42 that itself ends discrimination ? " the law was passed seven years ago with support of 58 percent of voters			2
it was added to the state 's constitution , and bars publicly funded colleges from granting " preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity or national origin			1
" that prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from a coalition of civil rights groups and @entity93 faculty and students , who counter the law actually burdens state residents , denying them the opportunity to persuade state and college officials to apply affirmative action			0
" @entity104 unconstitutionally gerrymanders @entity14 's political process , " said @entity102 , president of the @entity103 , " and relegates the critical topics of racial diversity and access to educational opportunity to a separate , distant , and far more cumbersome playing field -- one that is unplayable for all practical purposes			1
" many of the prestigious institution 's faculty and student body say classroom diversity remains a necessary government role			0
@entity14 voters approved the ban after the @entity43 @entity0 ruled in 2003 that while state universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit , they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted			1
the current ban " embodies the fundamental premise of what @entity43 is all about : equal opportunity under the law , " said @entity127 , @entity14 's attorney general			1
" entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit			0
" the referendum effort was led by @entity138 , who was at the center of the decade - old high court case			1
as a white student , she was put on the waiting list for undergraduate admission to the state 's largest university			2
she eventually attended another school , and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent discrimination lawsuit			0
after the @entity0 's 2003 decision , she began a public campaign to end racial preferences in admissions			1
" this will be an important day in the fight for true equality , " said @entity138 , who is now ceo of the @entity155 , which advocates for " equal treatment			0
" " how the court rules in this case will have national importance , determining whether or not citizens have the right to choose equality over discrimination			2
" the @entity14 ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions			1
but the current high court case deals only with the college admissions portion			0
efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial			0
the @entity177 high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools , but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states that initially refused to integrate			0
in the 1978 @entity185 case , the justices ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity , and that allows for the use of affirmative action			0
that issue involved a discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to law school			2
the referendum issue has been around at least since 1996 , when @entity199 voters endorsed @entity104 209 , which bans use of race , sex , or ethnic background by state agencies in areas of education , and government hiring and contracts			1
the @entity43 @entity0 in 1997 refused to consider lawsuits challenging the law , also known as the @entity211			2
but the high court under chief justice @entity213 has made the issue a key part of its docket in recent years , and it could serve as a major legacy of the current conservative majority			0
a ruling in the @entity14 appeal however may be limited in scope			2
" the @entity14 case is n't an opportunity for the conservatives on the court , for example , to say that affirmative action 's unconstitutional , " said @entity51			1
" but the justices can send signals to state legislatures , and to the public more generally , that either affirmation action is something they think should be encouraged , or something for which they 're very suspicious			0
" two years into @entity213 ' tenure , the conservative majority in 2007 struck down public school choice plans in @entity238 and @entity239 , concluding race could not be a factor in the assignment of children to schools			0
those school districts had sought to use raced - based criteria to achieve diversity			0
the debate in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met			0
now - retired justice @entity252 -- who wrote the key ruling a decade ago in the initial @entity14 cases -- said , " the court expects that 25 years from now , the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today			2
" the justices are now being asked once again to decide whether @entity14 's current policy in this case meets that legal and social test			1
justice @entity263 will not hear this petition , leaving the possibility of a 4 - 4 high court tie and no important precedent being established			0
the case is @entity127 v. @entity269 to defend @entity270 , integration , and @entity272 ( 12 - 682 )			0
a written ruling could come as late as june .			0

@entity0 will hear oral arguments on tuesday in @entity14 case
