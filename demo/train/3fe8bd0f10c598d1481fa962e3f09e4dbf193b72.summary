transcript this is a @entity18			2
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity22 , @entity23 : i scream , you scream , we all scream for @entity0 ! reporting from the @entity27 in @entity28 , i 'm @entity29			0
first up : health care @entity31 : 14 for , 9 against			1
that 's how the votes stacked up yesterday when the @entity34 voted on a health care proposal , and that was enough for the proposal to pass			1
committee chairman @entity38 , a @entity39 who helped write the bill -- called the @entity41 -- he called it a balanced plan			1
but the committee 's top @entity43 says he 's concerned about the direction that the bill might take health care in @entity10			1
now one thing we want to point out , this vote is just part of the process			1
@entity53 looks at how we reached this point and where the debate is going from here			0
( @entity56 ) @entity53 , @entity57 : there have been at least 60 hearings , more than $ 124 million of tv ads , one presidential address , and an unknowable number of status updates			0
finally , it 's game day			1
off the blocks , chairman @entity38 was feeling strong			0
@entity67 : it 's going to pass today ? sen. @entity38 ( @entity69 ) , finance committee chairman : yep , yep , yep			1
@entity67 : but all eyes were on senator @entity73 , the one @entity43 who might vote yes			1
would she ? sen. @entity73 , ( r ) @entity75 : let 's say i 'm sorting through all the issues			1
@entity67 : all this attention , all this interest			0
@entity81 : the meeting will come to order			0
@entity67 : this must be the final decision on health care reform , right ? wrong			1
this is just the vote of one @entity6 committee			1
next , their bill has to be stitched together with another bill passed by a different @entity6 committee , and that new health care bill will go to a full vote of the @entity6			1
so , you think that 's it , one more vote and health care reform is done ? oh no. over here at the @entity102 , they are working on their own health care bill that would be paid for differently and include some type of public option			1
if that passes , then you have two health care bills , one from the @entity102 and one from the @entity6			1
here 's the home stretch			1
those two bills have to be merged before the full @entity111 can make the big vote on health care reform			1
simple , right ? so , why is everyone taking this vote so seriously ? it 's serious because this committee has been the biggest roadblock to passing health care reform			1
and @entity43 @entity73 announced she 's voting yes			2
@entity120 : they want us to continue working			0
@entity67 : at least for now , the @entity123 can claim a smidge of bipartisan support , and health care inches forward to the next step			1
( @entity128 ) @entity129 @entity130 , @entity23 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an @entity133 country that 's a little smaller than the state of @entity136			2
on an alphabetical list of the world 's countries , i come first ! most of my terrain is made up of rugged mountains			2
and in 1996 , the @entity144 took control of my capital city of @entity147			0
i 'm @entity12 , where the @entity144 was removed from power in 2001 by the @entity10 - led military forces			1
why 40,000 ? @entity31 : there are 68,000 @entity10 troops in @entity12 right now helping to fight the @entity144			1
the group that used to control the country has regained strength in recent years			0
a top @entity10 commander said 40,000 additional forces are needed to win that fight			1
that 's a recommendation that many lawmakers , both @entity160 and @entity43 , are urging president @entity161 to follow			2
how did the commander come up with that number though ? 40,000 , what 's that all about ? @entity164 has the answer			1
( begin video ) @entity167 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : one hundred thousand @entity10 and allied troops are already fighting in @entity12			1
to understand why it 's believed general @entity171 wants 40,000 more , you need to look at a map the way military strategists see it			1
@entity176 , adviser to gen. @entity171 : what 40,000 does is fill in the gaps around @entity179 , around @entity180 , in @entity181			0
it does not , however , cover the entire country			0
@entity184 : @entity185 is an adviser to @entity171			0
she says it 's the minimum number to root out the @entity144 and identify and protect potential @entity12 partners			1
but the military 's own counter-insurgency ratio dictates it would take well over half a million troops to secure @entity12 's 33 million people			1
but @entity171 is not applying this ratio to all of @entity12			1
he feels certain parts of the country are peaceful enough , like the north , or just not as important , like the west , that they do n't need the same number of counter-insurgency fighters as these areas do			0
@entity200 : and that 's what gets him from a figure of hundreds of thousands of troops down to a figure such as 40,000 or 60,000 troops			1
@entity184 : @entity185 says @entity171 would use those troops to turn the tide , so the @entity144 does n't control every other town			2
she says 10,000 or even 20,000 troops just are n't enough			2
@entity200 : it 's not as though we can simply plug half as many holes with half as many troops and somehow seize the initiative from the enemy			1
on the contrary , half as many troops will probably leave us pinned down as we are			2
@entity184 : the problem is roughly 25 million @entity12 live in thousands of small , rural villages scattered all over an area the size of @entity136			1
up to 80 percent of the population could still be out of reach for coalition troops			2
so , when 30,000 @entity10 troops surged into @entity229 , that 's where one out of every four @entity231 lived			1
even if you take the top 30 most populated areas of @entity12 , you 'd still only account for 20 percent of the population			1
that 's how rural and spread out it is			2
@entity164 , @entity0 , @entity238			0
( @entity239 ) @entity240 @entity31 : severe weather causing problems even when you think it would n't			0
rain in an area that just struggled through fire			0
that might sound like a good thing , but experts are afraid it could make the situation even worse in parts of @entity253			0
you remember the wildfires we told you about recently			0
well , there is a storm that forecasters are calling the first major one of the season and it is pounding the state with strong winds and heavy rains			0
officials are concerned that when those rains hit the land that 's already been scorched by the wildfires , it could trigger dangerous floods and landslides			2
a few states to the north , you see where that road ends ? that 's not intentional			2
it 's the result of a landslide in @entity276			2
one resident said the whole face of the mountain just came off			0
it was n't caused by an earthquake			0
it was n't severe weather			0
it 's what scientists refer to as a " natural land movement , " one that caused an estimated $ 20 million in damages			2
@entity289 @entity31 : delivering meals to the hungry			0
offering music education to keep kids off the streets			0
providing prosthetic limbs to young people in need			0
just some of the work being done by this year 's @entity289			2
you can vote for the hero of the year at @entity301			2
then tune in to a special program on @entity304 night to find out who won			0
before we go @entity31 : before we go , do you choose chocolate ? savor strawberry ? praise the virtues of vanilla ? no matter what your ice cream cravings are , chances are that @entity315 's @entity314 can meet them , just like it has been for more than half a century			1
we 're gon na give you fair warning on this next report though			0
if you 're not hungry before you watch this story , even if you just had lunch , you 're gon na be hungry again by the time it 's over			2

we 've always served humongous portions			0
we came up with the kitchen sink because people called their ice cream in kitchen sinks , which were actually in a punch bowl			1
@entity344 : definitely worth the drive			0

i 'm going to try to be here as long as i can			0
i hope another 50 years			0
@entity360 : oh my @entity374 ! ( @entity239 ) goodbye @entity31 : a kitchen sink full of ice cream ? that 's one way to make your troubles melt away			1
