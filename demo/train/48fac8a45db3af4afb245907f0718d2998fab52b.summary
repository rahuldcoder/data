-- welcome to the new cool			1
forget pumped up , chiseled athletes focused on nothing more than winning			1
if snowboarders were the @entity11 ' introduction to a younger , hipper , " slacker " generation of competitors , the next wave of adrenaline junkies has taken it back to the new old school			1
" it 's like playing , " @entity16 said after winning gold in inaugural women 's slopestyle snowboarding event in @entity20			1
" we 're pretty much snowboarding on a playground up there			2
" @entity25 , which also has a ski discipline , is one of 12 new categories at 2014 @entity11 -- eight of which have their origins in extreme sports			1
it 's part of the @entity35 's bid to attract younger audiences , a mission shared by its broadcast and advertising partners			1
short - track speed skating was added in 1992 , and snowboarding came six years later			2
but forget the idea of 10,000 hours of repetitive practice -- as @entity16 says , these new sports are all about playing			1
all playgrounds have their own vocabulary , and expressions like " stoked , " " corked " and " stalefish " are rapidly becoming part of the sporting lexicon			1
as is the idea of fun , which the winner of the men 's slopestyle skiing event , @entity16 's fellow @entity53 @entity53 , was keen to reference			2
" i did n't try to put any more pressure on myself , i just tried to ski a normal contest and just do my best and have fun with it			2
i thought it worked out , " said the 22 - year - old in trademark understatement			2
his comments underplayed the reality that the @entity67 team annihilated the competition , claiming all three men 's medals to end @entity72 's monopoly of freestyle golds at these games			2
@entity53 had never won a major competition , and only qualified for the @entity11 two weeks ago			2
" i am shocked , " he conceded			2
" i am stoked to be up here with my friends			2
@entity67 , we did it			0
" with @entity81 and @entity82 winning silver and bronze , it was a historic moment -- the @entity67 had previously achieved such a clean sweep of medals on just two occasions : the 2002 men 's halfpipe snowboard competition , and the 1956 men 's individual figure skating singles			0
but there was a serious undertone for @entity53 , who has been mourning the loss of his father last year			0
" i hope i made my father proud , " he said			0
" through all the injuries i 've had , he 's always supported me and never said stop			0
i hope he 's looking down and smiling			0
" as part of the slopestyle " playground " there is a " kiss and cry " area , where the competitors wait to see their results			1
not that there was any signs of tears at the @entity111 on thursday			0
all the competitors look relaxed as if they were hanging out with their friends on the slopes of their backyard ski resort -- which is not so far - fetched , given they train together and meet at events several times a month			1
the glory and seriousness of the @entity11 seems something of a culture shock to these new olympians			1
their main event , the @entity123 , is all about showing off new tricks in fairly relaxed , showbiz atmosphere			1
and it 's not just spectators and television viewers who have been impressed by their performances			0
" it looks very spectacular , " @entity35 president @entity130 told reporters after @entity53 's win			0
" i just met the three medalists and they are cool guys			0
" " they found it ( the competition ) cool and now they wait for the party			0
when you win you have the party			0
" perhaps the @entity11 ' new breed is best encapsulated by @entity141			0
the 22 - year - old @entity142 might not have made it up on the podium , but he definitely garnered plenty of attention with his very , very low - cut pants -- which , by the end of his run , revealed much of his colorful underwear			0
along with the incredible tricks , style is a big part of these competitions			1
" i do n't think skiing with my ski pants so low is an issue , " @entity141 insisted			0
" i have been skiing like this for 10 years now			0
it is my style and has been for a while			1
" not everyone has been impressed by the tricks and a more relaxed of sporting competition " i think the president of the @entity35 should be @entity167 , because basically , this stuff is just ' @entity169 ' stuff that they invented and called @entity171 sports , " commentator @entity164 said on @entity165 said before the @entity123 began , referring to the comedic daredevil who was known for crashing into things			1
that 's not a view shared by the @entity176 , which has specifically targeted invested in these new sports , primarily because they deliver medals for @entity67			1
" we 've been able to really customize and drill down where we can have the greatest impact , " @entity180 , the @entity176 's chief of sport performance , told the @entity182			0
" i 'd like to try to get as many athletes as possible opportunities to become @entity187 , then become successful olympians as well			1
" so behind the cool exterior , there is some bottom - line accounting going on .			0

eight of the 12 new events at the @entity195 have their origins in extreme sports
incredible tricks , style and a relaxed atmosphere are a big part of these competitions
but the seriousness of the @entity123 seems a culture shock to these new olympians
