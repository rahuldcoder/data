-- when most people think of " @entity2 , the phrase " devourer of worlds " usually does n't leap to mind			0
and yet , that 's exactly how @entity8 depicted him , and @entity2 says he got it right			1
" @entity8 's extremely talented			1
i think that he captured my inner essence as the devourer of worlds			0
he kind of brought that to light , which i 'm very thankful for , " @entity2 said			0
@entity8 , a graphic artist from @entity15 , @entity16 , is using his talent to complete the " @entity23 " project : a compilation of 52 online trading cards featuring successful geeks and nerds			1
he 's issuing one a week for an entire year ; they can be found on geekaweek.net			0
he contacts heroes of the geek and nerd community , interviews them and then designs the front and back of a trading card			1
( he gets help with the text from collaborators @entity34			0
) the geek celebrities who answer the @entity23 call get @entity8 's special treatment : he attributes superpowers or alter egos to the people he profiles , based on their interviews			1
" he did incorporate some food into the image , and i 've been trying to live down my food obsession ever since ' eat it , ' but i 'm very happy with the card , and i think he did a great job , " @entity2 said , referring to his famous parody of the @entity52 song " beat it			2
" the work is usually a collaboration			0
actor @entity55 wanted to experiment with duality on his @entity23 card , so @entity8 drew him as an evil twin , @entity8 said			1
some celebrities , like @entity60 ( of " @entity62 " fame ) , are n't completely comfortable with the first round of drawings			0
" i thought his first illustration of me was a little too harsh and a little too evil and did n't quite look like me			0
so i ended up with my laptop and my webcam , posing with the very mask that i 'm holding in the card , so that he could have a better drawing reference , " @entity60 said			2
the resulting trading cards are colorful , artistic and as informative as any @entity72 : the gathering , @entity74 , " @entity75 " or " @entity76 " trading card			1
" trading cards is a really good idea			2
there should be something like this for every industry , like @entity85 ... or @entity86 , " @entity80 said			0
@entity80 helped create " @entity90 " ( he also was the voice of @entity88 in the 1990s television show ) and is featured on @entity23 with his current wise - cracking movie critiquing troupe , @entity91			1
@entity80 and @entity8 were working together on another project , the recently published book " @entity95 for @entity96 , " when @entity8 mentioned his idea for @entity23			1
consequently , @entity80 played into @entity8 's quest for contacting celebrity nerds			1
@entity80 's mst3k mate @entity100 ( now with @entity101 , also profiled in @entity23 ) was able to introduce @entity8 to @entity103 - winning parody artist and accomplished accordionist @entity2 for the project			1
@entity2 loved the idea of @entity23 and was eager to help out a fellow nerd			1
he said the format of trading cards was a perfect platform for nerdy information			1
" collecting anything is really part of nerd dna			0
collecting and processing data , in and of itself , is nerd nirvana			0
' @entity121 , ' " said @entity2 , who considers himself to be generally a nerd but a geek about some things			2
" a project about geek heroes , i think , is one way that people from that subculture can feel validated			2
they realize that there are more people like them , and here are these successful ones , and perhaps that will inspire them to greater achievement			2
" being a geek is all about learning the inventories of things			2
whether it 's instantiations of @entity140 or esoteric algorithms for programming or characters from ' @entity76 , ' geek culture is really defined by esoteric inventories			2
" @entity8 got in touch with @entity60 through mutual friends @entity34			1
" it 's exactly the kind of innovative ambition that 's awesome when you see someone do it			0
@entity8 actually reached out to all the people that he 's ever admired in the geeksphere and has managed to spend time interviewing them all , " @entity60 said			1
" i love everything about [ @entity23 ]			1
the fact that the trading cards are a ' collect them all ' kind of deal and the number of trading cards add up to the number of cards in a deck , it 's all neat as you please , " he said			2
actress @entity170 , mastermind of " @entity171 " and known for her turn as @entity173 in 2008 's " dr. horrible 's @entity179 , " was approached to be part of @entity23 after her friends @entity175 and @entity55 re-tweeted their appearances in the deck			1
" when he asked me what i wanted to do , i was like , ' well , i really just want to be in space , or i want to be in a sci - fi setting			0
' the fact that he put me in one of the best video games of all time and as such an iconic figure -- i think he paired me with just the right thing to make me excited to see myself , " @entity190 said			0
@entity8 admits that day 's trading card is one of his favorites			1
on it he references the @entity198 game " portal			0
" thanks to his connections , @entity8 has other big names in his @entity23 stack , like @entity204 co-founder @entity203 and filmmaker @entity205 , but he also includes plenty of geeks whom the general public might not know about			1
" everybody on my list is doing some amazing things in their field , whether it be blogging , whether it be entertainment , whether it be music or tech , " @entity8 said			1
" it 's kind of this exploration			0
if you do n't know who a @entity219 is , then you should know			0
if you do n't know who @entity222 or @entity223 is , then figure out who that is , " he said			0
according to @entity2 , a man who has made a career out of creating entertainment that 's appreciated by nerds and geeks , @entity8 's devotion makes his product more compelling			1
" if a geek was n't behind @entity23 , i think you 'd know			1
when i did ' @entity235 , ' i think why it struck such a response with fans is that they knew i walk the walk			0
i was n't singing about a culture i was unfamiliar with , i was basically singing about my life , " @entity2 said , referring to another song parody			0
fans of @entity8 's project and the heroes he 's profiling are sure to stick with it for all 52 weeks			1
in addition to the cards , the @entity23 website includes podcasts of @entity8 's interviews that give fans further insight about their heroes			1
as for spoilers about whose cards fans can expect to see in the coming weeks , @entity8 was generally mum but very excited to share the fact that he recently interviewed author @entity259			2
the @entity23 alums have their own hopes for who might show up on the trading cards : " @entity2 ( @entity23 's " @entity264 of worlds " ) : if you 're talking about blue - skying it , i think probably @entity269 would be a natural choice			1
personally , i do n't think they would classify as nerds themselves , but i think icons to nerds of my generation [ are ] @entity276			2
that 's sort of a right of passage for a nerd is to be able to recite " @entity283 " word for word			0
@entity170 ( @entity23 's " new media actress / test subject " ) : @entity269			2
he 's pretty popular , right ? @entity60 ( @entity23 's " @entity62 / @entity286 " ) : i would love to see a @entity288 card			1
i think @entity289 is a dyed - in - the - wool geek			0
it just occurred to me , i know @entity289			0
i think i 'm going to try to hook him up with @entity8			2
@entity80 ( one of @entity23 's " master riffers / monster hunters " ) : i do n't know if @entity294 is a nerd or a geek			1
... he 's an enigma			0
and what about the possibility of @entity23 becoming honest to goodness , hard - copy trading cards ? " i get two or three requests a day to make hard copies			1
they lend themselves to it perfectly			0
now , it 's just a question of how we can make it happen			0
i 'd love to see them , just like everybody else , " @entity8 said			2
" they need to be packaged with really stale gum , " @entity80 added			0
" and i would eat the gum ! "			0

@entity316 has a *thriving* community of nerds , according to @entity8
the trading card format conveys a lot of information to the geek audience
@entity23 brings successful geeks to a more *mainstream* audience
