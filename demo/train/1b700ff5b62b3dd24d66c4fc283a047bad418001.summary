" " once mr. @entity9 arrives in @entity6 , his request will be formally processed , " @entity14 said in a statement on its website			1
@entity0 spotted a car with diplomatic plates and an @entity6 flag at @entity26 's airport on sunday			1
and the @entity28 news agency reported that @entity6 's ambassador to @entity30 said he would be meeting with @entity9 at a @entity26 airport hotel			1
as word spread that @entity9 had left his @entity36 hideout and was headed to @entity30 on sunday , the former @entity33 contractor became the center of a global guessing game			2
media reports speculated that he could be traveling to @entity6 , @entity40 or @entity41 -- all countries where leaders have sharply criticized what they call the @entity4 government 's imperialist approach			0
why would @entity6 win out ? is that country likely to grant @entity9 asylum ? @entity6 president @entity49 , a left - leaning economist , has railed against the @entity4 in concert with allies in @entity52			2
lawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as @entity9 lands in @entity30 and it 's been nearly a year since the @entity13 country approved a similar asylum request from @entity14 founder @entity59 , who is now holed up inside @entity6 's embassy in @entity61			1
he faces arrest in @entity64 and possible extradition to @entity66 if he leaves the embassy			0

a source familiar with the matter said the @entity4 government had revoked @entity9 's passport			0

@entity94 , @entity0 law enforcement analyst and a former assistant director of the @entity96 , pointed out that @entity6 has n't granted @entity9 asylum yet			1
@entity14 ' @entity59 urges support for @entity9 , slams @entity99 " right now who knows where he 's going to ultimately end up , or how long it 's going to take him or how many connecting flights , " @entity94 said on sunday			2
" and you know , he 's pushing the envelope of how many places he can try to go before he would fall into hands of being in custody and possibly extradited back to the @entity4 " or technically , because he does not have a valid @entity4 passport , and if he does not have another valid passport , then the next situation could be for those countries to say , ' you 're here illegally and we 'll deport you , ' " @entity94 said			1
wherever @entity9 goes next , @entity4 officials have said they plan to push to prosecute him			0
but @entity117 , a law professor at @entity118 , told @entity0 that extradition treaties " are read differently by countries in different circumstances			0
" the @entity4 has its share of critics who say it ignores international law regarding the treatment of prisoners or the use of drone attacks , and host countries are allowed to question " whether a charged crime was a political act			0
" " it does n't help to have all these senators and members of @entity138 calling for this guy 's head , " @entity117 said , referring to lawmakers who have accused @entity9 of treason			0

that is not going to help the @entity147 or the @entity148			0
" @entity59 : how notoriety has changed a trapped man @entity0 's @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 contributed to this report .			0
