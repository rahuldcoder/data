a silent , nimble , two - wheeled killing machine			2
that 's what @entity3 researchers envision , now that they 've greenlighted developing a hybrid motorcycle powered by two sources : an engine that burns several types of fuel and a stealthy , super-quiet electric motor			1
imagine an elite @entity12 fighting force deployed in a mountainous region of @entity14 , riding motorbikes that are nearly silent			1
the loudest sound is tires on dirt as they twist and turn down dried river beds and up narrow goat trails			2
when they launch their assault on a @entity26 stronghold , the enemy is taken by surprise			0
the @entity3 's @entity28 has tapped defense contractor @entity29 and motorcycle maker @entity31 to design the motorbike			1
as a platform for the project , @entity29 is talking about @entity31 's 250 - pound @entity35			0
although the @entity36 is totally electric , @entity29 wants to combine that with an engine that burns regular gasoline , as well as jet fuel and diesel			0
it 's expected to have a range of 100 miles and make very little noise , even when the conventional engine is running			0
" it looks like a nice bike , " said @entity45 , a former @entity46 special operations staff sergeant , after watching a @entity48 video of the @entity36			1
" i do n't know about that wheelie action though , " he laughed			0
" i ca n't see any of our guys doin ' that			0
" troops mounted on stealth bikes could deploy via helicopters or verticle - landing @entity60 @entity59 and later switch to silent mode for the final leg of their ground approach , @entity55 said			1
controlling engine noise would be an important weapon for bike - mounted forces , @entity45 said			2
but @entity45 said @entity3 motorcycle developers should keep this in mind : " the guys on the ground love to keep it simple			1
it has to be simple because as soon as you start making things complex , things break , fall apart , it 's less feasible			0
" @entity45 -- now a 30 - something @entity80 - based defense contractor and writer -- knows a thing or two about fighting @entity26 on wheels in the @entity14 mountains			1
he did it for about a year with the @entity86 after two deployments in @entity88			0
during his time in @entity14 with @entity86 , @entity45 and his teammates used small , four - wheeled , all - terrain vehicles to push quickly through rough topography during @entity94 missions			2
soon after he left the unit in 2010 , @entity45 said @entity46 special ops in @entity14 began improvising and bringing motorcycles into their weapons arsenal			1
they started acquiring cheap " @entity102 knockoff " motorbikes in @entity14 bazaars and customizing them			1
" they 'd weld racks on the back and repaint them , camouflage them down , " he said			0
" the bikes mainly became a way to overcome covering long distances over harsh terrain			2
" it was really a case of fighting fire with fire			0
@entity26 have been riding mopeds and motorcycles to attack @entity12 forces since the beginning of the war in 2001 , said @entity45			1
" they know the most practical , low stress , low impact way to get around the battlefield and maneuver			0
" soon the @entity46 developed tactics using the bikes			1
they announced a formal training program in 2012			0
troops rode the motorcycles regularly during @entity86 combat reconnaissance patrols , @entity45 said			2
" the bikes allowed @entity46 to patrol larger areas , to easily and quickly zip up hills			1
quick access to higher terrain allowed a tactical advantage which was often safer than , say , a low - lying village , where @entity46 might risk getting caught in an ambush			1
another advantage : by constantly moving on motorbikes , special ops forces keep enemies guessing about their location			1
@entity26 " do n't know where you 're going and they do n't know what your intent is , " @entity45 said			0
" the motorbike just amplifies that			0
" @entity12 forces can use the bikes to sneak up behind enemies or block their escape			1
" you can do a lot of damage , just having that mobility			0
" @entity12 special forces including @entity159 and @entity161 combat controllers have been using motorcycles for their operations for years			1
@entity55 says the widely used current @entity12 military motorcycle -- imaginatively dubbed the @entity165 -- is based on a platform that 's nearly 30 years old			1
@entity45 's forthcoming book on @entity86 operations in @entity14 , " @entity169 , " is set to drop in september			2
the book follows a 2012 article that grabbed attention on military blogs			0
its title : " @entity175 in @entity14			2
" " whenever you get a bunch of guys together on motorcycles with firepower , it 's basically a gang , " @entity45 said			0
" a very lethal gang			0

the @entity3 is developing a silent , *rugged* combat motorcycle
@entity12 @entity46 used dirt bikes in @entity14 special ops , says author
motorbikes offer tactical advantages to special forces
