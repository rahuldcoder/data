in the busy streets , shoppers and workers rush by the homeless little boy with a flute -- some dropping change , but most ignoring him			1
sitting on the sidewalk in @entity7 , @entity8 , his head is barely above knee height of the adults around him			1
but he plays on -- for hours , knowing that each coin or note can help his family survive another day			2
the flute is a cheap one , but it is key to their struggle			0
the money he makes -- usually about $ 10 a day -- will help feed his mom and four siblings			1
the family escaped the horrors of war in @entity29 , @entity30 , and he says they now live in a park			1
he does not say which park or if they have a tent for shelter at night			0
according to @entity39 figures , there are about 1 million registered refugees in @entity8 , but the country says the total is closer to 1.6 million			2
research from the @entity44 adds that in the last couple of months , there has been another spike as @entity30 flee the rise of @entity49			0
the boy says he has been in @entity8 for about a year			1
he plays falteringly and his young face looks innocent , but he knows the cruelty of war			0
he says his dad died in @entity29 , which has seen some of the fiercest fighting in @entity30 and is a rebel stronghold that president @entity59 's army has attacked			1
the boy , who says he is 6 , complains that his head hurts and talks of the guns back in @entity29			1
as he plays on , he is relying on the kindness of strangers and watching for police patrols , as begging on the streets is illegal			0
when police do see him -- this time as he walks back to his makeshift home -- an officer confiscates his flute			0
but he can not be kept down			0
a new flute is $ 5 -- half is daily profit -- but if he is to play on , if he is to help feed his family , if they are to have some hope , it 's a small expense			2
and tomorrow , he will play again .			0
