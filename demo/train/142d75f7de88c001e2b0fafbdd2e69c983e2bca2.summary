@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3			0
@entity4 pleaded guilty thursday to 10 of the 22 charges against him -- but not the most serious one , " aiding the enemy " -- in what the government says is the largest leak of classified documents in the nation 's history			1
and , for the first time , @entity4 offered his rationale for the crimes			1
in court , @entity4 detailed why and how he sent classified material to @entity18 , a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website			1
he said he passed on information that " upset " or " disturbed " him , but nothing he thought would harm the @entity24 if it became public			1
@entity4 said he thought the documents were old and the situations they referred to had changed or ended			1
reading a statement for more than an hour , @entity4 described his motivations , beginning with what he called " sigact tables , " documents describing significant actions in @entity34 and @entity35 that he said represented the " ground reality " of both conflicts			1
he said he 'd become " depressed about the situation there " and made copies of the sigact tables in his secure workstation in @entity34			0
then , he took them back to the @entity24 and pondered what to do with them			2
@entity4 said he first called the @entity46			2
he spoke to a woman who he believed was a reporter and told her the kind of material he had			0
after five minutes , he got the impression she was n't taking him seriously , he said			0
he said he then called the @entity53 and got nothing but answering machines , so he left a message and his phone number and e-mail address , but never heard back			0
@entity4 said he finally decided to send the documents to the @entity18 organization			2
" i believed if the public was aware of the data , it would start a public debate of the wars , " he told the court			0
@entity4 acknowledged to the court he was not authorized to receive the classified documents he leaked and said he knows that he had other avenues through which he could have expressed his dissatisfaction			1
exposing @entity71 cables , military video after he sent the documents to @entity18 in early 2010 , @entity4 said earlier , he became aware of an online debate about @entity76 's financial troubles and its relations with the @entity78			2
he decided to learn more about the issue , using his access to @entity71 cables			0
he said he sympathized with @entity76 in the dispute and believed that @entity76 was being " bullied " by the @entity78 , and that the @entity24 would n't help			1
so he decided to send related information to @entity18			0
it was published to the world within hours			0
at that same time , @entity4 said he learned about @entity87 ' battle with the @entity24 military over video of a helicopter gunship attack on a truck carrying a @entity87 news crew in @entity34			1
two @entity87 staffers were killed in the attack			0
he said the military told @entity87 that the video might not exist , but @entity4 had seen it			2
he made a copy of the video and planned to send it to @entity87 when his tour ended			0
@entity4 said the video and the behavior of the @entity24 involved was so disturbing , " it burdens me emotionally			1
" he was so upset , he decided to upload the video to @entity18 immediately			0
in that case , @entity4 said , @entity18 did not publish the video right away			2
later , while communicating through chat rooms with a person whom he believed to be a top @entity18 official , he was told that the video was about to be published , and that he would n't be hearing much from them for a while			0
" i 'd have nothing but work to distract me , " @entity4 said			2
apparently bored by his regular analyst duties and prodded what he described as a curiosity about geopolitics , he began reading the @entity71 cables			0
he decided the @entity24 public should know how its diplomats go about conducting foreign affairs			2
@entity4 took the most widely distributed diplomatic cables and made copies for @entity18			2
" i believed that the public release of these cables would not damage the @entity24 , but might be embarrassing , " he told the court			1
the court proceedings after @entity4 's guilty pleas , @entity128 judge col. @entity127 asked the defendant questions to establish that he understood what he was pleading guilty to			1
in addition , she reminded him that his lawyer had filed a motion to have the case dismissed on the grounds that he was denied his right to a speedy trial -- a motion that @entity127 denied tuesday			0
by entering guilty pleas , @entity4 loses his right to have an appellate court consider that ruling , if he chooses to appeal			1
a military lawyer who follows the case told @entity2 the tactic is known as a " naked plea , " or a guilty plea in the absence of a plea deal			0
the lawyer said that by using that strategy , the defense apparently hopes the government will feel victorious about the guilty pleas @entity4 has entered and wo n't go through the effort of a trial			1
but prosecutors reiterated that they will pursue the rest of the case against @entity4			2
the judge accepted the guilty pleas , but noted @entity4 could withdraw them at any time prior to sentencing			1
he could receive up to 20 years on those charges			0
@entity4 said deciding to make the material public was " beyond my pay grade			0
" @entity4 has asked for @entity127 , instead of the military equivalent of a jury , to decide his guilt or innocence on the 12 charges to which he pleaded not guilty			1
the most serious remaining charge , aiding the enemy , carries the potential for a life sentence			1
the @entity24 military initially detained @entity4 in may 2010 , shortly after @entity18 published the @entity71 cables			1
@entity4 was turned in by @entity179 , a former hacker , whom @entity4 allegedly told about leaking the classified records			0
in december 2011 , @entity4 's @entity181 , the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing to determine whether enough evidence existed to merit a court - martial , began			1
he was formally charged in february 2012			0
after a military judge denied @entity4 's lawyers ' motions to dismiss charges in april 2012 , the process proceeded , with @entity4 's court - martial scheduled to begin on june 3			1
@entity190 reported from @entity0 and @entity191 wrote this report in @entity193 .			0

@entity4 offers his rationale for the crimes , saying he did n't mean to harm the @entity24
he has pleaded guilty to 10 of 22 charges against him
@entity4 did not plead guilty to the most serious charge : aiding the enemy
his court - martial is scheduled for june 3
