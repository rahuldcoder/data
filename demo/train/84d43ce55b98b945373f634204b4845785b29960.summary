the source spoke on the condition of not being identified because the person is not permitted to discuss the matter publicly			0
the source also estimated that up to 150 @entity3 police are working on the case			2
@entity16 's prison escape raises a number of questions : how did an inmate get guns and explosives ? how did he manage to use those to force his way out ? and , after all that , why is he still at large ? the four guards who @entity16 allegedly held hostage " are safe and sound , " said @entity23 prosecutor @entity65			1
still , officials from the prison guards ' union pressed @entity32 to provide better safety measures inside prisons , including more thorough searches of those who enter , @entity29 reported			1
built in 2005 , the @entity23 - @entity76 penitentiary is not old , but it 's not well designed to keep watch of prisoners , said @entity79 , a former associate director there			0
