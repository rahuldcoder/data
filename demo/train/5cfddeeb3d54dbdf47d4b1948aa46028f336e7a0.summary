-- may we spend a few minutes discussing a major part of @entity4 life where there has been a shocking lack of diversity ? this has to do with presidential elections			1
and it 's not what you think			2
throughout @entity4 history , @entity14 colleges have had an outsized proportion of alumni who became president			1
if , as is widely expected , it 's @entity21 versus @entity22 in november , the @entity14 is the guaranteed winner again , because it will be @entity19 against @entity19			1
( @entity19 's @entity22 has even , in speeches , criticized @entity19 's @entity21 for spending too much time " at the faculty lounge at @entity19			1
" ) in fact , it has been 28 years since a @entity29 graduate has been elected president			1
@entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity21 all went to one ( or both ) of those universities			0
in four of those elections , the winning @entity36 ran against another @entity36 ( @entity38 , incumbent president @entity31 , @entity39 , @entity40 )			2
but that 's not the oddity we 're discussing today			2
we all know , and have known for a long time , that in presidential elections , as in much of @entity4 life , the @entity14 has a leg up			1
and many of our presidents , to their credit , have come from small , non-glitzy colleges			2
nine presidents either never went to college at all , or never received a degree			2
they were no slouches ; they include @entity61 and @entity62			0
here , though , is the strange , almost inexplicable , thing -- and it stands out for those of us who attended , and really liked , @entity68 schools : no graduate of a @entity68 university has ever been elected president			1
is n't that something ? heart of the country , large student populations , fine faculties , national renown -- yet in the history of the @entity4 , the voters have not even once seen fit to send a @entity68 graduate to the @entity81			1
it 's not that talent , leadership and creativity are lacking in @entity68 students			1
every member of the @entity68 ( there are 12 schools in the conference now , since the addition of @entity92 and @entity93 ) has had numerous graduates -- undergraduate and advanced - degree -- who have done remarkable things			1
@entity98 , of @entity99 , was the first human to set foot on the moon			0
@entity102 , of the @entity103 , led @entity104 during glorious years			2
@entity105 , of the @entity106 , founded the legendary public opinion poll			0
@entity108 , of @entity109 , is a widely acclaimed author			0
@entity110 , of @entity92 , went on to become a @entity4 secretary of commerce			1
@entity112 , of the @entity113 , became an esteemed actor			0
@entity115 , of @entity116 , was a justice of the @entity4 @entity118			1
@entity119 , of the @entity120 , was a women 's movement , labor and civil rights leader who was awarded the @entity124			2
@entity125 , of the @entity126 , was the co-founder of @entity127			0
@entity128 , of @entity129 , was a @entity130 for physiology / medicine			0
@entity133 , of @entity134 , left for a reporting job just before graduating , and went on to become perhaps the most admired newspaperman who ever lived ; the university brought him back to present him with an honorary degree			2
and @entity139 , of the @entity140 ... well , he was @entity139			0
which just may have been better than being president			2
the list of @entity68 achievers goes on and on			1
yet voters have sent no one from a @entity68 school to the @entity81			1
( if you 're thinking , what about @entity150 , the president from the @entity113 ? yes , he became president , but the voters never elected him on a presidential ticket , a fact that bothered him for the rest of his life			2
when he did run on his own , he was defeated by @entity158 , of @entity159 , @entity160 and the @entity161 )			0
you would think that being from the @entity68 would provide a campaign plus			1
@entity163 , breadbasket , center of the nation , the warm symbolism of all that			0
@entity14 graduates may take pride in their education , but they tend not to stress their @entity172 to voters in a presidential campaign : like being rich , being from the @entity14 is something that may be privately savored , but that , in national elections , is best not flaunted in front of those without the same advantages			0
being from the @entity68 , on the other hand , would seem to be a ticket to @entity182			1
@entity184 , professor of history and public affairs at @entity187 ( alma mater of presidents @entity189 and @entity190 ) , said that he , too , is puzzled by this			0
one reason for it , he said , may be that at universities that have a tradition of educating future presidents , " students often become part of networks of classmates who go on to do big things in @entity199			0
these networks are essential when potential candidates are identified to run for president			0
" still , said @entity184 , whose work regularly appears in the @entity209 section , " it is unclear why someone from the @entity68 would not be president , given the great quality of these institutions and impressive record , including in politics , of many of these graduates			1
" so what could it be ? is it simply a jinx ? you might be tempted to say that the @entity68 is the @entity223 of presidential politics -- except , even though it has been more than a century , the @entity223 did win a @entity226			1
you might be tempted to say that the @entity68 is the @entity228 of presidential politics -- except that the soap opera actress , after years of being passed over , finally was awarded an @entity231			1
the @entity68 has a @entity232 and @entity233			1
i asked some of its members what they make of this			0
not surprisingly -- speaking from the middle of the country -- they were optimistic and proud			0
@entity242 , president of @entity243 , said : " if you knew our current students and could witness their abilities as young leaders , you would be as confident as i am that we will see a @entity249 become the @entity250			0
" @entity109 president @entity251 expressed great contentment about his part of the nation : " as to no president coming from the @entity68 , i would say that many have come from @entity68 country -- we just have sent them off elsewhere			1
that is ending , by the way			0
" " we did offer , twice , " said @entity120 president @entity260 , pointing out that @entity120 graduates @entity261 and @entity262 were @entity264 nominees for president			0
they were defeated by @entity53 and @entity55			0
" you never say never , " @entity260 said			0
" of course it could happen			0
" and @entity270 , president of the @entity106 , summed it all up with a sure - handed sense of sunny @entity68 perseverance : " in the words of @entity276 and @entity277 , perhaps ' it 's @entity278			1
' " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity281 .			2

for 28 years , @entity4 's president has been either a @entity19 or @entity29 alumnus
@entity281 notes that @entity68 grads have never been voted president
he says even the @entity223 won a @entity226 , and @entity228 won an @entity231
@entity68 university presidents predict the *drought* will end one of these days
