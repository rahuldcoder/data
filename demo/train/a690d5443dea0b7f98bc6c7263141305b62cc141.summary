, but winter is the only season when you can jump around in snow like a little kid and not look like a drunken fool			1
turn off the " @entity13 " reruns , put on your marshmallowy - est puffy jacket , and go outside ! here are our six recommendations for snowy competitions to watch or compete in , if you 're brave enough to try			1
@entity18 , @entity19 ( january 22 - 25 ) shaping and carving snow is one thing , but actually dealing with the thick blankets covering the ground is an art in and of itself			1
at the fifth annual @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity19 , the event coordinators have cleverly made a competition that is actually exciting and entertaining out of just cleaning up snow			1
competitors -- often college students -- design , develop and build their own snowplows			1
and if that is n't impressive enough , the machines must be controlled electronically during the competition			1
each snowplow navigates a course and clears a designated path in the snow			1
visitors can watch in awe ( and maybe with just a teensy bit of jealousy ) as the teams are judged on their creations ' designs , presentations and performances			2
@entity49 , @entity50 ( january 24 - 25 ) the @entity51 are the perfect event for any snow lover or dog lover			1
if you prefer to keep the beasts at a safe distance , you can appreciate their power and agility while watching them speed through the snow			2
if giving plenty of cuddles and kisses is more your speed , head over to the petting zoo for a more personal experience			2
the @entity70 race is open to everyone : professional racers , kids and teams with mixed breed dogs			1
if this show of speed and control still does n't impress you , watch the skijoring races , where people must not only balance on skis but be simultaneously pulled across the snow by dogs			1
it 's very impressive to those of us who ca n't even manage to get the knack of " normal " skiing			1
@entity90 @entity89 , @entity91 ( january 26 - 31 ) if you see a blank sheet of snow as merely fodder for a massive snowball fight , the 2015 @entity90 @entity89 in @entity92 , @entity91 , will blow your mind			2
at this prestigious event , artists showcase their ability to tame blocks of snow into stunning masterpieces			2
they work with ladders and scaffolds to gently carve and smooth their blocks until the image within shines through			2
the single - block sculptures are larger than life , often standing even taller than the artist , but they must fit within a 12 - foot circle			2
these sculptors are the best of the best			0
the winners of each state competition come to @entity92 to vie for the winning title			0
the winner also receives an invitation to compete in the @entity120 sur @entity121 - sanctioned @entity89			0
@entity122 , @entity123 ( february 2 - 15 ) if you 're one of those @entity127 fans who has to catch each mogul and every exhilarating run down the slopes , just imagine how incredible it would be to watch it all in person			0
at the 2015 @entity122 , you will be able to admire every snowflake and gasp along with the crowd -- and every devastating wipeout -- as the world 's most talented skiers navigate the slopes			0
even if skiing is n't really your thing , the town of @entity140 will be the perfect winter wonderland during early february			1
musical phenoms @entity144 & @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity90 authors will all be performing during the championships			0
spend your free moments sampling @entity152 beers at the @entity153 or checking out the @entity154 , where each new day brings a whole new spread of international food and drinks			0
@entity158 , @entity159 ( february 6 - 8 ) at the @entity158 , the competitive tobogganing is a far cry from what most of us did sliding down our driveways on old cardboard boxes			1
here , the competition is fierce , and many of the sleek toboggans are handcrafted to ensure the fastest runs possible			0
although watching other people whiz down steep hills on small wooden planks is certainly entertainment enough , the town of @entity171 is offering a bevy of other kinds of entertainment during the weekend of the championship			0
test your culinary prowess at the @entity182 , show your creative talents during the @entity185 parade , and snuggle around the bonfire			0
for older guests , the 2nd @entity187 is the perfect way to mix the magic of snow and the magic of alcohol			0
taste a cornucopia of beers and wines , and vote for your favorite brewer as the alcohol keeps you from feeling the snow 's frosty bite			0
@entity201 , @entity202 ( february 6 - 13 ) perhaps you 've watched curling teams compete in the @entity127 and thought to yourself , " really ? that 's a sport ? " but just add a wheelchair into the equation , and the whole thing gets infinitely more impressive and more captivating			0
at the @entity209 in @entity202 , that 's just what you 'll see			0
only one new rule sets the wheelchair athletes apart from the traditional curling competitors : no sweeping			1
besides that , every skill and strategy is the same .			0

winter weather should n't keep you from competing out of doors
one @entity50 dog sled race is available to *novices* and experienced competitors alike
this tobogganing is more than sliding down your driveway on a cardboard box
