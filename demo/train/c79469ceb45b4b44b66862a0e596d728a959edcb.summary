talent , a 20 - 1 outsider , dominated rivals to capture the @entity3 , the premier fillies ' classic of the season			1
the @entity7 - trained filly made a brilliant last - to - first move in the home straight at @entity10 under jockey @entity11 to lead home a talented field including stablemate @entity14 in second and @entity16 in third			1
all the attention pre-race had been on @entity7 's other runner , the @entity19 - owned @entity14			1
@entity21 's @entity20 decided to buy a half - share in the filly just this week after her impressive 10 - length victory in the @entity3 trial			1
the endorsement of one of the most competitive owners in the business helped propel her to early favorite in the markets , leaving @entity0 relatively unexposed			2
but the chestnut daughter of @entity31 showed her true colors as she swept past her rivals to claim victory by 3¾ lengths			2
the @entity36 was a further ¾ length behind in third , with favorite @entity38 in fourth			1
after a somewhat fractious start in which several of the fillies appeared to become unsettled by the atmosphere on course , an early break - neck pace was set by @entity45 's @entity44 , who appeared to taking a keen hold with jockey @entity48			0
by contrast , @entity11 was content to settle talent towards the back of the field , choosing to make his move after rounding the famous @entity54 and gradually moving up through the field before letting @entity0 hit her stride inside the final furlong			1
at the start of the season , veteran jockey @entity11 had yet to capture an @entity60			1
he is now two for two in the fillies ' classics , having won the @entity63 on @entity64 last month			0
" it 's like buses is n't it ? " @entity11 said			2
" i thought that i would win five furlongs out , she was going that well			0
i would say that she would be even better on better ground			0
" @entity7 added : " i was n't watching her until she suddenly loomed up on the outside			0
he just put her in the race and she got keen and started tanking then			0
having the first two does n't happen , does it ? " @entity74 is @entity78 racing 's premier fillies ' race and was first run in 1779 , making it one year older than the @entity80 itself			0
it gives its name to , among other races , the @entity84 .			0

talent , not *expected* to win , makes a move in the home straight to claim the @entity3
for jockey @entity11 , it marks his second win in an @entity60 in two months
@entity14 finishes second , ahead of @entity16 and pre-race favorite @entity38
