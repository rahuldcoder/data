-- a federal judge ruled friday it is unconstitutional to force abortion clinics to become surgical centers in the state of @entity6 , effectively throwing out a key component of an anti-abortion law that would have forced the closure of a number of facilities			1
in making the ruling , @entity13 district court judge @entity12 wrote that forcing the clinics to meet the same standards as hospital - level surgical centers " imposes an undue burden on the right of women throughout @entity6 to seek a previability abortion			1
" that part of the @entity6 law was scheduled to take effect on monday ; critics of the law say it would have required the closing of a majority of 19 abortion clinics			1
the @entity31 and the @entity32 filed a notice of appeal			0
the controversial law , which was signed by gov. @entity36 last year , is considered one of the most restrictive in the country			0
the @entity39 brought the lawsuit on behalf of some of the clinics , and it called the federal judge 's ruling a victory			1
" the court has made clear that women 's well - being is not advanced by laws attacking access to essential health care , and that rights protected by the @entity13 @entity55 may not be denied through laws that make them impossible to exercise , " said @entity46 , president and chief executive officer of the @entity39			1
" @entity6 women still face serious threats to their rights , health , and ability to obtain safe , high - quality reproductive health care from reputable doctors in their communities			0
but at least for the moment , today 's victory is vital in preventing politicians ' scorched - earth assaults on women 's health care from causing even more harm than they already have			2
" the state law also banned abortions past 20 weeks of gestation , tightened usage guidelines for the drug @entity76 , and it requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing such services			2
last year , @entity12 overturned the requirement that doctors have admitting privileges , but a federal appeals court reversed the decision			0
the 20 - week ban provision took effect last year , while enforcement of the remainder of the law is slated to take effect in september			0
