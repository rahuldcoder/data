the @entity32 , in a report titled " @entity5 : no let - up in the @entity35 , " writes , " despite limited improvements in security in some areas , armed violence is still having a disastrous impact			1
civilians continue to be killed in the hostilities			0
" the injured often do not receive adequate medical care			0
millions of people have been forced to rely on insufficient supplies of poor - quality water as water and sewage systems suffer from a lack of maintenance and a shortage of engineers			0
" the @entity54 administration and many @entity56 lawmakers , including presidential candidate sen. @entity57 , have frequently praised successes in @entity5 in recent months , noting improvements in security in key areas			0
they attribute that in part to the buildup of @entity66 troops in @entity5 ordered by president @entity54 last year			2
vice president @entity67 described the five year @entity66 - led invasion of @entity5 in a news conference monday during a visit to @entity71			1
" this week marks the fifth anniversary , " said @entity67			1
" it has been a difficult , challenging , but none the less successful endeavor			0
" democrats , including presidential hopefuls @entity76 and @entity78 , have said the government failed to use the downturn in violence to achieve the steps it was supposed to make possible			0
sen. @entity57 met with @entity5 prime minister @entity85 on monday where he stressed the @entity66 ' commitment to @entity5			2
" we recognize that @entity89 is on the run , but they are not defeated			0
@entity89 continues to pose a great threat to the security and very existence of @entity5 as a democracy			0

" in its report , @entity18 says the @entity5 government " has failed to introduce practical measures to deal with the gross and serious human rights violations perpetrated by its security forces			1
there appears to be no serious willingness to investigate properly the many incidents of abuses , including killings of civilians , torture and rape , and to bring those responsible to justice			0
" the government has also been unable to reign in @entity139 militia groups , such as the @entity140 , or to rid the @entity141 of death squads			2
the fact that the government is divided along sectarian lines has serious repercussions on its effectiveness and bodes ill for the future			0
