-- the disappearance of @entity2 is arguably the greatest mystery in the history of commercial flight , with an extensive search failing to turn up a single piece of definitive evidence of its whereabouts			1
on sunday , the search vessel @entity12 is expected to arrive at its designated search area in the southern @entity14 to begin the next phase of the search			1
the ship , and two others which will arrive within the month , will conduct detailed sonar sweeps in an attempt to locate wreckage of the plane			2
here 's where we are with the search for @entity2			1
what happened initially ? around 1:30 a.m. on march 8 , air traffic controllers in @entity29 , outside @entity30 , lost contact with @entity2 , a @entity32 , over the sea between @entity34 and @entity35			1
the plane 's transponder , which identifies the aircraft and relays details like altitude and speed to controllers , stopped transmitting , and the passenger jet seemingly disappeared without a trace			1
planes and ships from 14 countries initially searched areas of the @entity49 , south of @entity35 and the @entity34 peninsula			0
the search was then widened and then shifted location as it was determined that the plane diverted south			2
since then resources have been focused on a swathe of the @entity14 , around 2000 km ( 1242 miles ) off the west coast of @entity57 , the so - called " seventh arc			1
" what has been done in the @entity14 so far ? after seven weeks of intense but fruitless searching , the international air effort to find the plane ended in late april , shifting the focus to an underwater search			1
hopes were raised in may as radio beacon signals -- " pings " -- were thought to have been detected , but the area where the pings were thought to originate from was discounted in may			2
since the active search was postponed , the @entity71 government has been creating an accurate survey of the sea floor in the search area			1
one ship , from @entity78 surveying company @entity77 , continues to map the underwater topography			2
to date , over 111,000 square kilometers of the wide search area have been analyzed and mapped by the @entity71 government and its contractors			1
the existing data for the sea floor in that area is at a very low resolution , says @entity87 , head of the @entity88 of @entity89 , the agency overseeing the mapping process			1
getting an accurate picture is crucial as the drones that will be conducting the underwater sonar search in the upcoming phase will need to be guided with precision to avoid damage			1
" in the second phase of the search , which involves towing devices close to the sea bed to get a very fine resolution picture of what 's down there it 's important to have that level of detail so we do n't run into objects , " he said			1
" it 's a long way from shore at very significant depths so it 's a logistical challenge			0
it 's unprecedented in terms of doing a survey of this size and in this remote location			0
" it has been an involved , long and difficult process			0
" the recently acquired ( underwater survey ) data has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time , " the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) , the agency leading the search , said in a statement			1
the survey also reveals finer features that were not visible in previous , low - resolution survey data			0
at the request of the @entity34 government , the @entity71 government -- in particular the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) -- has been tasked with leading the search			2
" the complexities surrounding the search can not be understated , " the @entity119 says			0
" it involves vast areas of the @entity14 with only limited known data and aircraft flight information			2
" what happens next ? the @entity71 government said in august that it has picked @entity140 , a @entity78 company for the mapping and the next phase of undersea search , along with a vessel , the @entity12 , supplied by the @entity34 government			1
the latter will , weather permitting , arrive at its assigned search zone late sunday and , will deploy towed sonar to begin the search on on monday and will conduct search activity for 12 days before going to @entity152 , in @entity57 , for resupply			1
the search vessel will be joined by the two @entity78 ships , the @entity156 and the @entity157 , later in the month			0
the @entity157 is currently finishing up detailed mapping of the search zones			2
" the current plan envisages that we will progressively cover our priority search areas over the course of about a year , " @entity160 , chief commissioner and ceo of the @entity119 , told @entity0 by phone			0
what we know is that the aircraft will be found close to the arc , the final attempt at communication between the aircraft systems and ground stations			0
we 've done progressively more refined and detailed analysis of the other satellite information that has enabled us to prioritise ( search areas ) along that arc			0
" we have a high probability that the aircraft will be found at the southern end of that long arc			2
we now know in considerable detail what almost all of the search area looks like , we 've mapped these in detail			2
we can tow our sonar equipment about 100 meters ( 329 ft ) from the ocean floor in confidence that we wo n't run into any unexpected obstacles			0
" what happens if / when the wreckage is found ? @entity160 says that it largely depends on where , and how , the plane is found			0
the @entity71 contingent , he says , is still discussing plans with their @entity34 colleagues on how to proceed in the event of a positive identification of plane wreckage			0
" if you have a debris field identified , to be able to know what to do with it requires careful mapping and photographing , which will take up to a month , " he says			0
" until we 've got that largely completed we wo n't understand the sequence of what we 're able to do in relation to wreckage and human remains			0
" what happens if they do n't find it within the current search timetable ? there is $ 60 million ( $ 52.8 mil ) earmarked by the @entity71 government for mapping and underwater search , and @entity71 expenditure is to be matched by @entity34 government			1
it is a significant resource upon which to draw , @entity160 says			0
however , " if at the end of that we have n't found the aircraft , then it 's really going to be a matter for governments to decide what 's next what resources they might wish to supply and i ca n't really preempt what that discussion might be			0

next phase of search operations set to begin , with underwater sonar *drogues* to be deployed
search follows intensive sonar mapping of a huge area of seabed in the southern @entity14
@entity2 disappeared without a trace over six months *ago*
even after an intensive search , nothing was found
