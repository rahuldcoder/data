an attack by snipers on a @entity3 power substation last year is prompting the former chairman of the @entity5 to launch a crusade to better secure and defend the nation 's electrical grid			1
the former chairman , @entity9 , now a @entity10 energy law attorney , called the little - publicized april 2013 attack on the substation a " very well planned , coordinated and executed attack on a major piece of our electric grid infrastructure			1
" while @entity9 has expressed concern that the attack may have been a test run for a bigger strike -- possibly terrorism -- the @entity22 has declared the incident was n't an act of terror and is still investigating the case , with no arrests made			1
the @entity22 considers the incident vandalism , said spokesman @entity29 in @entity10			1
" there is no nexus to terrorism at this time , " @entity29 said			0
nonetheless , @entity9 is urging @entity33 to fill a void in federal law that he says does n't empower any federal agency to demand better security around electrical substations , which he describes as barely protected with a chain - link fence and cameras			2
even those cameras do n't capture details outside the fence , because they are more focused inside it , he added			0
last year 's sabotage was carried out by at least one sniper at a good distance from the fence , outside the camera 's focus , @entity9 said			1
" we need to have a national coordinated plan , and we have to have a federal agency that is in charge , " @entity9 said			2
so far , @entity55 rep. @entity54 , @entity56 , has joined the call for improved security			2
the matter was addressed at a december hearing of the @entity55 @entity61 , of which @entity54 is the ranking member			0
" just this april , there was an actual attack on our electricity infrastructure , " @entity54 said , referring to the @entity3 shooting			1
" this was an unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military - style weapons			1
the attack inflicted substantial damage			0
it took weeks to replace the damaged parts			0
" the nation 's critical infrastructure and defense installations simply can not function without electricity			1
yet it is clear that the electric grid is not adequately protected from physical or cyberattacks , " @entity54 said in a statement			0
in all , 150 rounds from an assault rifle were fired over almost 20 minutes at a @entity86 substation south of @entity87 , @entity56 , knocking out 17 transformers in the post-midnight darkness of april 16 , according to @entity86 , @entity9 and @entity91 affiliate @entity90			1
to prevent a blackout to @entity3 , workers re-routed power , but it took almost a month to make repairs , the affiliate reported			1
authorities also found an @entity99 fiber optic cable was cut in an underground vault , causing a phone blackout , sgt. @entity102 with the @entity103 told @entity90			0
by the time police arrived , the shooters , also suspected of damaging the phone line , were gone			0
at the time , the incident was n't publicized , but since he stepped down as @entity5 chairman in november , @entity9 is raising public attention to the @entity56 sniper 's attack to demonstrate the vulnerability of the nation 's electricity system			1
@entity54 is apparently endorsing @entity9 's initiative			0
@entity54 is urging @entity33 to pass legislation that would " fix this gap in regulatory authority " and empower @entity5 to directly address threats to the nation 's power grid			1
in 2010 , the @entity122 passed such a measure , called the @entity124 , but the @entity125 did n't act on the proposal , @entity54 said			0
the federal government relies on an energy industry organization " to develop reliability standards for the electric grid through a protracted , consensus - based process , " @entity54 said			2
after the @entity56 vandalism , @entity132 also saw last year " multiple attacks on power lines and grid infrastructure that led to millions of dollars in damage and brief power outages , " @entity54 said			1
@entity86 officials said they have redundancies built into their electric grid " that enable us to reroute power around damaged equipment and help keep the lights on for our customers , " said spokesman @entity146			2
" since the incident occurred , @entity86 has worked aggressively with federal and local agencies to improve substation security throughout our system , " @entity146 said			1
" the utility industry and stakeholders like the @entity157 are meeting with policy makers , government officials and law enforcement at all levels to engage in constructive dialogue and share information on how we can work together to protect the grid across the country			0
" the institute , an association of shareholder - owned electric companies , says security and protection are " top priorities			0
" " electric companies are partnering closely with each other and with senior officials from all relevant federal and law enforcement agencies to protect the grid 's most critical assets , " said @entity170 , the institute 's senior director of national security policy			1
but he noted that " publicizing clearly sensitive information about critical infrastructure protection endangers the safety of the @entity55 people and the integrity of the grid			0
" in the meantime , @entity9 is urging utilities to enact low - cost improvements such as replacing chain - link fencing with an opaque barrier that would block a sniper 's vision of the substation			2
@entity9 is also recommending movable concrete jersey barriers as a perimeter around the substations -- to stop any sniper bullets			0
he 's also recommending utilities extend lighting beyond the fence yard , with more sophisticated cameras , so video can capture saboteurs outside the fence			0
the @entity56 sniper or snipers were 40 to 60 yards outside the substation fence , he said			2
" this is n't about this substation or this organized attack , " @entity9 said of the @entity56 incident			2
" this is more about the larger issue of physical security of these high - voltage substations nationwide and the need to ensure that some defensive measures start to be put in place			0
