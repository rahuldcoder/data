@entity0 -- @entity2 is boycotting , demonstrators are demanding and president @entity4 and a veteran @entity6 senator also are calling for changes in " stand your ground " self - defense laws in the aftermath of the @entity12 killing			1
despite such pressure tactics , neither @entity4 nor @entity13 have much say in the matter because the battleground for altering or eliminating the statutes is in state legislatures rather than @entity0			0
@entity19 , where @entity12 was shot to death last year by neighborhood watch volunteer @entity21 , is one of more than 20 states with a " stand your ground " law or some other form self - defense measure			1
last week , gov. @entity27 met with protesters seeking repeal of the law and told them it wo n't happen , citing the recommendation of a task force he appointed after @entity12 's killing			1
weekend " justice for @entity12 " vigils continued the push by civil rights leaders for repealing such laws , and @entity2 has said he refused to perform in @entity19 or any other state that has them			1
to former @entity45 chairman @entity44 , wonder 's boycott showed the difficulty facing those seeking repeal			0
" this is something that 's going to have to get worked out state - by - state , " @entity44 told @entity53 's " @entity52 " on sunday			2
" it 's not just @entity19			1
" the sliding scales of self - defense on the same program , @entity58 rep. @entity57 of @entity59 said leadership at the federal level can help , but the @entity64 chairman added that " you can not legislate against prejudice or bias or racism			1
" the @entity21 trial that concluded july 13 with an acquittal in a @entity19 court has sparked a fierce national debate involving race , justice and politics			1
@entity12 , a 17 - year - old unarmed @entity76 , was shot to death by @entity21 in a confrontation in a residential community			1
civil rights groups say @entity21 started the fight in what they label racial profiling , while his lawyers argued the shooting was in self defense after @entity12 attacked him			1
two new polls released monday showed a divided @entity89 public over the verdict , with equal numbers saying they approved or disapproved			1
a @entity94 / @entity93 survey found 41 % of respondents in favor and 41 % against the jury 's ruling , with a sharp difference between african - americans and whites			2
the poll showed that 86 % of african - americans opposed the verdict , while 51 % of whites agreed with it			0
that was similar to a @entity105 survey that showed that 86 % of african - americans disagreed with the verdict , while 49 % of whites were in favor			0
@entity4 issued a written statement after the verdict , then stayed silent until friday , when he sought to explain the anger among african - americans over @entity21 's acquittal while also indicating no federal charges would be filed against him			1
" once the jury 's spoken , that 's how our system works , " he said , adding that while attorney general @entity112 was looking further at the case , those calling for federal civil rights charges must " have some clear expectations here			0
" in @entity89 , law enforcement and the criminal code are " traditionally done at the state and local levels , not at the federal level , " @entity4 said			2
that also applies to " stand your ground " laws , which exist in nine states			0
in addition , 22 states including @entity19 have laws stating that residents have no " duty " to retreat from a would - be attacker , according to the @entity134			1
@entity2 says he 'll boycott ' stand your ground ' states the @entity19 version of the law states that " a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force , including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony			1
" though @entity21 's defense never cited " stand your ground " laws in its case , the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations			1
@entity21 was acquitted of all charges			0
the " stand your ground " laws came about with support from the @entity171 , which argues that self - defense is a fundamental human right			1
in his remarks friday , @entity4 called for reconsideration of those measures			0
" i think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the @entity19 case , rather than diffuse potential altercations , " @entity4 said			2
conservative @entity6 sen. @entity191 of @entity192 immediately slammed @entity4 's comment , warning it could bring an assault on the right of @entity89 to own guns			2
" it is not surprising that the president uses , it seems , every opportunity that he can to go after our second amendment right to bear arms , " @entity191 said			0
however , fellow @entity203 sen. @entity203 of @entity204 rejected @entity191 's conclusion and said he believes the @entity204 legislature would take another look at what he called the state 's " controversial " law			0
protestors stand up to ' stand your ground , ' but laws likely to stay what are the chances of repeal ? in @entity19 , @entity27 's office noted that the task force he appointed recommends the law stay in place , though with minor tweaks , including limiting neighborhood watches to observing and reporting			1
@entity225 , director of the @entity226 , said he doubted protests against " stand your ground " laws would change anything			2
overturning laws is n't very common , he said , and " stand your ground " laws have some popular appeal due to the " the very general notion that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you should n't have to , in essence , run from crime			0
" also , @entity225 noted , the laws are relatively new , with most enacted in the past eight years			0
therefore , it was unlikely the same legislators who passed them would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong , he said			0
" the more common response is , they 're going to dig their heels , " @entity225 added			0
doubts about ' stand your ground ' according to the @entity251 , " stand your ground " laws emerged due to " diminished sense of public safety " after 9/11 , a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system 's ability to protect victims , a perception that due process trumps victims ' rights and a decrease in gun legislation			0
a study by the group cited concerns from law enforcement officials about such laws , including doubts that they would deter criminals			2
@entity225 pointed to a @entity273 study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed some version of " stand your ground " laws from 2000 to 2010			2
researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery , burglary and aggravated assault , but there was an 8 % spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter			0
@entity1 's @entity289 and @entity290 contributed to this report .			0

new : polls show @entity89 is divided over the @entity21 verdict
despite protests and boycotts , states are unlikely to *quickly* change self - defense laws
calls for repealing @entity19 's law followed the acquittal in the @entity12 shooting
a study found self - defense laws do n't reduce assaults or murders
