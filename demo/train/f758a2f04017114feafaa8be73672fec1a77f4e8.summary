@entity0 wants to know what 's in your wallet			1
it also wants to know your address , so its representatives can come visit if you owe money			1
at least , those are the accusations leveled at the credit card giant this week			0
at first blush , it seems that @entity0 would be barred from this activity by federal law			1
specifically , the @entity15 outlaws even less - intrusive behavior			0
under the act , debt collectors are prohibited from making repeated phone calls , calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. , or even calling at times the collector should have known are inconvenient			0
certainly , the debt collection act would frown upon showing up at a debtor 's home			2
the problem is , the act protects debtors against abusive collection tactics by third - party debt collectors and debt buyers only			0
it does not apply to the original creditor			0
there 's nothing in the debt collection act that prevents @entity0 from showing up at your home : in fact , the law does n't prevent the original creditor from doing anything			1
as long as no other law bars this activity , the parties -- consumer and credit card company -- appear to be free to enter into a contract			1
@entity0 's rules said customers can be contacted by mail , phone , e-mail or " personal visit			1
" does that mean consumers can unwittingly agree to their credit card company showing up at their door because they missed a payment ? modern contract law is on a collision course with technology			2
historically , contracts have been paper , detailed in a reasonable number of pages			2
the expectation that a consumer would read an entire contract was not unreasonable			2
today , the price of existing in the modern world is hastily clicking our assent to an endless number of " clickwrap " agreements , often dozens of pages long , where you simply scroll through and check a box to complete your purchase			1
sure , you can read all the fine print , if you have an extra four hours a day			0
and if you do n't agree with @entity79 ( g ) ( 3 ) of some online purchase agreement , you can refuse to click -- but then again , who loses ? now , you ca n't order those commemorative plates or pair of shoes for delivery			1
none of these contract terms is negotiable			2
they are all " take it or leave it			0
" because we all depend on the internet to a large extent for goods and services , most of us grit our teeth and agree -- section 109 ( g ) ( 3 ) and all			0
contract law has been slow to acknowledge this reality			2
courts have upheld these online " agreements " based on the contract principles that consumers should read every page of an agreement before they sign it			1
that advice is still sound today -- but is it reasonable ? is the only other option to wander the @entity109 as the lone luddite , disconnected from progress and civilization ? perhaps contract law should intervene to prevent the mega-corporation from sneaking or forcing contract terms upon an unsuspecting public			0
the social implications of this suggestion are equally ominous : are we entering an era where citizens can not be expected to take responsibility for the contracts they enter into ? on one hand , it seems wrong that corporations , with their legal teams , should be permitted to impose 50 pages of one - sided terms upon the average @entity131			0
on the other hand , have we the people gotten to the point where we are n't competent enough to be responsible for the contracts we willingly sign ? we the people apparently are not alone			1
even @entity0 does n't understand its contracts			1
capital one was quick to release a statement saying that it does not visit cardholders , nor does it send debt collectors to homes or offices			0
@entity0 will maintain that the credit card rules sent to cardholders have the same language as those sent to anyone who buys a car or sports vehicle through a secured loan from the bank			2
if those buyers default , @entity0 has acknowledged that its representatives might actually visit those homes to repossess			1
that 's fine , but why did the cardholders receive the same contracts ? the bank is considering creating two separate agreements because this language does n't apply to the general cardholder base			1
that 's fine , but why did the change come only after bad press ? notice one common theme ? all the misunderstandings , the accidents and the oversights seem to accrue to the benefit of @entity0			1
coincidence ? accident ? i 'm sure it is			0
credit card companies always have their customers ' best interests at heart			0
and if you 're not convinced , just ask them ... when they ring your doorbell .			0

@entity0 cardholder contract said it can make a " personal visit " if you owe money
@entity186 : we check " yes " on long online contracts without really reading them
@entity186 : these contracts might be sneaky , but are n't we responsible if we sign them ?
@entity186 : @entity0 said it 's an oversight , just a *boilerplate* contract , and no one will visit
