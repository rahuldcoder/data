former president @entity0 is enjoying another bounce in the post-presidential polls			1
first , the opening of his presidential library produced a spate of positive coverage about his time in office			1
now , @entity10 has released a survey showing that for the first time since 2005 , more people approve than disapprove of @entity0			1
this kind of shift in public opinion is likely to continue , with more upswings as well as downturns ahead			0
this is the nature of presidential legacies			2
they are a bit like what @entity22 once said about the weather in @entity25 : if you do n't like it , just wait a second and it will change			0
presidential reputations are never fixed in stone			1
with the exception of a few of our leaders , such as @entity36 of @entity37 , people tend to remember presidents in different ways at different times			1
even some of the more unpopular presidents have seen their support rise in the post-presidency period			2
why is it the case ? the most obvious reason is that the passions for presidents -- both good and bad -- tend to go down after they leave office			1
@entity49 turn their attention to the new boss and to new issues , and the focus of their sentiment shifts elsewhere			0
this is particularly true in our heated political times when voters become so polarized on their feelings about a leader -- feelings that can become most intense as we approach the elections			0
another factor has to do with what the successor does in office			2
much of the controversy that surrounded @entity0 had to do with his national security policies			1
the war in @entity71 caused a huge controversy with many @entity49 feeling the president had gone into an unnecessary war based on false evidence			2
by the second term , many @entity49 were also upset with some of the tactics the administration had used to pursue terrorists , such as interrogation			0
but president @entity81 , who campaigned as a critic of these policies , ended up leaving many of the programs in place and actually becoming more aggressive on certain fronts , such as the use of drone strikes			1
@entity81 has given these controversial policies a certain bipartisan imprimatur that has dulled the anger that existed toward @entity0			1
the ways in which a president 's policies unfold over time is also essential			1
in some ways , @entity81 did @entity0 a favor			1
by bringing @entity71 and @entity99 to an end , he took these issues off the public radar			0
without any kind of mass chaos in those countries , as some critics had warned would occur , the issues that caused @entity0 so much problems faded from the public mind			1
the flip side is that some policies look better in perspective			2
although the @entity116 program still has many critics , the fact that it stabilized the financial markets and ended up not costing the federal government any money makes one of @entity0 's most controversial decisions look better in hindsight			2
presidential reputations also can be shaped , in the relative short term , by what a president does after leaving office			1
for example , former president @entity128 has been successful in rehabilitating his image through his extensive post-presidential activities on foreign policy			0
former president @entity133 has enjoyed strong approval for his work with his international foundation and , among @entity137 , through his decision to engage in partisan wars after his time was done			0
@entity0 might have helped himself by staying outside of the media spotlight			2
there is a certain amount of good will that emerges as the structural problems with politics become clear			0
when a president is in office , they tend to receive all the blame , or credit , for what happens in @entity153			1
when there are problems moving forward a policy , such as in reviving the economy , the public tends to blame the president			0
but when those problems continue long after a president is gone , as has been the case with the economy , the public tends to gain some perspective ( even as they attack the existing president ) about how the sources of discontent stem from the structural problems with the government and the economy rather than any individual person			0
we judge a president based on the political times we are living in -- not simply in the times that they governed			0
presidential reputations could improve if the polls are tallied at a moment when a president resonates with the politics of the moment			1
finally , and this is not relevant to @entity0 yet , the opening of archival records from the period a president is in office can dramatically change how we see him			1
president @entity189 , who was once treated as a popular yet bumbling president , was found to have had a firm grip on decision - making in the @entity193			0
discoveries from the @entity196 archives in @entity197 , @entity198 , revealed that he was much more than a former @entity200 actor who moved to the top through charisma and luck			0
@entity81 might want to take a close look at these kinds of swings			2
on the one hand , it might give him some solace that even with all the grief he has faced over issues such as health care and sluggish economic growth , it is easy to see how his record could look much stronger to @entity49 over time			0
on the other hand , he might want to be a bit cautious about taking too much comfort from positive approval ratings			0
after all , it 's all relative with respect to time .			0
