effects of cell phone radiation has been blocked by a federal judge			1
upon passage , @entity5 's ordinance was challenged by industry trade group @entity12 , which claimed the ordinance 's requirement that retailers post messages about cell phone safety violated the @entity18			1
@entity5 initially agreed to amend the ordinance after the @entity12 filed suit , and made some changes , but they were n't enough			2
judge @entity22 found that the ordinance failed the sniff test on both scientific and @entity18 grounds			1
" whether or not cell phones cause cancer is a debatable question and , at this point in history , is a matter of opinion , not fact			0
the industry has the opposite opinion , " wrote judge @entity22			1
the fact - sheet required by the ordinance is " misleading and must be corrected , " notes the judge			2
" although each factoid in isolation may have an anchor in some article somewhere , the overall message of the fact - sheet ( and the poster , for that matter ) is misleading by omission in two important ways			0
the overall impression left is that cell phones are dangerous and that they have somehow escaped the regulatory process			0
" the @entity53 issued a report that seemingly butressed @entity5 's position in may when it labeled cellphones " possibly carcinogenic , " meaning that there is " limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals			0
" but results of a massive , 15 - year - long study released earlier this month showed absolutely no link between cellphone use and cancer , echoing the findings of numerous other studies			1
the judge left the door open to the possibility that a revised " fact sheet " could pass muster and stayed the enforcement of the law until november 30 so that both sides can file appeals			0
@entity5 has already promised to do exactly that			0

@entity12 *contests* ordinance for consumers to be informed about cell phone radiation *hazards*
judge @entity22 finds the ordinance failed the sniff test on scientific grounds
a 15 - year - long study shows no link between cell phone use and cancer
