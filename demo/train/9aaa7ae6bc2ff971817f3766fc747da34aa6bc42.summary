-- very soon , you will be sick of slow - motion videos			1
they will fill up your @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 feeds			0
the amateur clips will show pets jumping and playing , objects falling and breaking , and people dancing about in glorious , high - quality slow motion			1
you can blame the @entity13			0
slow - motion video is the most addictive feature of the new @entity16 ( turns out fingerprint scans are useful but not really " fun " )			1
the camera can shoot 120 frames per second ( regular video is typically 30 frames per second ) and then slow down all or part of the video to show details that would usually have sped right by			1
this technique is so cool that the @entity28 had a whole series devoted to it			0
" @entity34 " employed extremely high - speed cameras and then slowed the footage way down to examine principles of physics			0
apparently , it 's also cute for weddings			0
the camera is always one of the primary reasons people choose to upgrade to a new @entity13 , right up there with overall speed			0
with each generation of phone , @entity43 has made incremental upgrades to the camera 's hardware and software , such as the ability to shoot video , to use a flash or to snap panoramic images			1
here 's a closer look at the key features of the @entity16 camera : low - light performance for the @entity16 , @entity43 improved overall image quality by expanding by 15 % the amount of sensor space the camera uses to capture pictures			1
@entity43 kept the camera at 8 megapixels but made the existing pixels larger , resulting in better low - light performance			1
shooting photos in low - light settings is an area where all smartphones can use a little improvement			2
nighttime photos are often grainy or murky because of slow shutter speeds , small sensors and shoddy flashes			0
the @entity16 has noticeably improved its low - light performance with the larger pixels and by adding auto - image stabilization , which corrects for shaky hands			1
it also replaces the @entity13 's old single flash with a new two - light system called true - @entity82			1
instead of washing out a scene with a single flood of light , the new system takes a pre-flash to decide what the color temperature should be and then chooses the appropriate settings for cool and warm light			0
there are 1,000 potential lighting combinations , and while it 's still a far cry from a professional flash , it 's a big improvement			0
@entity96 just as every camera is a little better , every @entity13 is a little faster			1
this round , there 's a powerful @entity101 chip inside			0
the camera feels faster as a result , especially when you switch over to a new feature called @entity96			1
pressing and holding the shutter button now takes a rapid series of shots -- 10 frames per second , up to 999 total images			0
if you 're taking a photo of a fast - moving subject or want to be sure you do n't miss a fleeting moment , @entity96 covers all the bases			1
it even helps you pick the best shots from the bunch by looking for things such as sharpness , smiles and whether a subject 's eyes are open			2
there 's a bit of an adjustment period with this new feature			2
on the old @entity126 , you would hold down the shutter button until you were ready to capture an image , then lift your finger to capture it			0
now you can accidentally end up with 45 photos of a sunset			0
other features the new camera also contains a handful of smaller improvements , including a feature that crops images into squares and adds filters , @entity5			1
in a final touch , the panorama feature -- available since the @entity13 -- can now subtly change the exposure as you pan across a scene			0
slow motion is still the most fun new feature , but it 's also the most frustrating when it comes to sharing			1
the files are large , so there are a few hurdles you must jump to upload the clips directly to @entity5 or some other platforms			0
for example , you first must run the image through one of the phone 's share - screen options , which include @entity4 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			2
the phone - camera battle the @entity16 is not the first smartphone to get these features			1
in fact , @entity165 's @entity164 has slow motion , a mode for shooting action and many other camera extras not included on the @entity13 , including the ability to speed up video clips and make animated gifs			1
owners of the @entity16 can add some of these missing features through third - party apps , however			1
the @entity16 does not even have the most powerful camera hardware			2
that honor goes to the @entity179 , which packs a much - hyped , powerful 41 - megapixel camera , great for zooming in on images taken from a distance			2
what @entity43 does have is a great alternative to a point - and - shoot in a popular operating system on coveted hardware			0
at this point , it 's pretty much a given that smartphones have severely wounded the market for point - and - shoot cameras			2
in the first half of 2013 , point - and - shoot sales shipments were down 42 % from the same period last year , according to the @entity195			0
that tumble follows years of declining camera sales as smartphone manufacturers compete against each other for the best new camera features			2
for the average consumer , the real camera battle will continue to be between smartphone manufacturers as they struggle to improve a feature that 's limited by space and technology			2
and @entity43 will continue making small camera improvements			0
maybe the @entity208 will include a @entity210 option			0
but for now , the slow - motion feature wins this round of @entity13 upgrades .			1

the new @entity16 has a much - improved camera
the camera has a larger light sensor and a @entity96 feature for action shots
it also shoots slow - motion video
it 's not the first phone to have these features , and others may be better
