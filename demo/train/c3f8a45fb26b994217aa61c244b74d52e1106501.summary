-- at 6 ' 3 " and 277 pounds , @entity1 had a body mass index of 34.6			1
anything over 30.0 on the @entity6 scale is considered obese , and his doctor warned him that his blood pressure was too high			1
so the doctor gave @entity1 some medication and told him to take the pills daily			1
side effects , she cautioned , could include erectile dysfunction			1
" ca n't i just exercise and eat healthier ? " he remembers asking			1
" think about it , " @entity1 says with a laugh			1
" a 40 - something year - old man on a race not to take pills that cause erectile dysfunction			2
every guy i tell that to goes , ' @entity22 , i can relate to that			2
' " the documentary filmmaker bought a bike and started adding salads to his diet			1
two months later he returned to the doctor and was pronounced perfectly healthy -- despite having lost only 6 pounds			2
it 's a journey that he chronicles in " @entity31 : the @entity32 , " a follow - up to his first award - winning film			1
the documentary focuses on the @entity39 ' unhealthy obsession with dieting and losing weight			1
" we have a health problem , not a weight problem , " @entity1 says matter - of - factly			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity1 about his film , why he believes the @entity6 system should be outlawed and the award he 's most proud of			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : why did you start filming the " @entity52 " documentary series ? what sparked your passion for the topic ? i always had this knack for attracting really awesome , quality women in my life			1
like i had a five - year [ relationship ] , a five - year and an eight - year relationship			2
[ but ] i used to travel around the country with these athletes and entertainers , running into these women that would hang out at the gate			2
after doing that for a while , i went , " wow , you know what ? i want a girlfriend that 's awesome like the one i have , but that looks like these [ groupies ]			2
" after being exposed to them for so long i could no longer appreciate the awesomeness of the woman that i was with			2
so that 's when i started thinking , " why did i do that ? " like when you have so much , why was beauty so important ? that gave me the idea to do a documentary			1
@entity0 : what did you learn from your first documentary ? i was sitting around watching my film one day and it occurred to me -- it just hit me -- all these three things : plastic surgery , cosmetics and eating disorders , are things that primarily affect women			2
and we still have an archaic appreciation for women in our country because if things primarily affect women , nobody does anything about it			2
but when it affects men , they do something about it right away			2
... it 's like we 're in 1910			2
everything looks really sophisticated because you have computers , you have @entity116 , you have smartphones and tablets , and everything you see looks so developed , but underneath it , i do n't believe we value women the way that we should in this country			2
@entity0 : why did you decide to focus on dieting in your second documentary , " the @entity32 ? " when i was traveling with the first film , i went to 287 universities			2
at each one ... somebody would stand up and say , " wow , we really like your film , but you did n't deal with the dieting industry			1
why not ? " so i go on the computer one night just researching dieting , and i come across this website that has the @entity6 , body mass index , of celebrities			2
so according to this website , the @entity6 of @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 -- all these celebrities -- make them either overweight or obese			0
and i 'm like , " this is the most ridiculous thing i ever heard			0
" so then i did some more research on @entity6			0
the government uses it , doctors use @entity6 , schools use @entity6 , and i 'm like , " this is how they get you			0
" in the first film , i show how we use beauty as a weapon against the @entity39 public -- now we 're using weight as a weapon against the @entity39 public			1
@entity0 : what is wrong exactly with the @entity6 system ? it was invented in like 1830 ... and it was invented to show sizes of populations			0
like , for instance , the entire population of the @entity39			0
it was never intended to be used for an individual diagnosis of someone 's health and how much they should weigh			1
that came in the 1970s with this guy @entity175 when he reformulated it to the current @entity6 thing			0
then in 1998 , some of the scientific advisers of @entity180 went to the government and said , " hey , you know what ? the number that 's used for the overweight category for @entity6 should be lowered			0
" and the government did it			0
and when they lowered it , literally 25 million people became overweight , overnight			0
but guess what : those are new customers now for the dieting industry			1
@entity0 : can you really say obesity is n't a big problem in this country ? why are you , in a way , fighting against that sentiment ? first off , because [ if ] you are defining [ obesity ] by @entity6 , then it 's erroneous			1
so what we may have as a problem in this country is a health problem			1
we show it in the film			0
we have a health problem			1
and what we also show in the film is that health problems come to people with or without weight			1
so the film is making the point that we should be focusing on the health of people and not their weight			1
where we have problems is lifestyle choices			0
we have too many people eating fast food			0
we have too many people not exercising			0
we have too many people not engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors			0
my point is if we have more people engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors , we will become a healthier nation , whether we lose weight or not			1
if you think about it -- it makes sense , right ? @entity0 : tell me about the third documentary in the " @entity52 " series			0
what will it be about ? so far i 've done the health and beauty series , so the next one will complete it and make it the health , beauty and sex series , which are the three biggest things affecting our youth			1
it will be about the sexualization of our youth			0
everyone says that 's going to be the whopper there			0
i 'm going to start it in january			0
i have no idea what i 'm going to find			0
i always start my documentaries with no preconceived notions , and i jump in interviewing people to see what i can find			1
@entity0 : what award for your documentaries have you won that you 're most proud of ? there 's a film festival that @entity140 and @entity271 are affiliated with -- the @entity272			1
it 's a film festival for kids			0
they never show documentaries , only feature films that appeal to kids , right ? but with [ " @entity52 " ] , the @entity272 made an exception to let a documentary in there			1
i went to the screening , and i was terrified that my film was going to put all these kids in a comatose state			0
we went to the awards presentation , and they announced the audience award and called our name			0
here are kids voting a documentary as their favorite film in this big film festival			0
that was literally my proudest moment			0
@entity0 : where can people see " @entity52 : the @entity300 " ? [ it 's ] actually touring around the country in theaters			1
we 've been to six cities so far ; we 'll go to 30 more			0
they can go to our website at @entity308 and go to the screening schedule and see when we 'll be coming to a city near them			0
it [ also ] comes out on @entity313 in march .			0

@entity1 says @entity31 has a health problem , not a weight problem
@entity1 is filming three documentaries on beauty , health and sex
" @entity323 : the @entity300 " focuses on the diet industry
