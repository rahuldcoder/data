@entity0 -- the front end of @entity3 is working better , but many problems identified in the days after its launch persist , according to a team of web engineers			1
@entity9 is a private web - hosting company that analyzed the public - facing side of the site days after its disastrous october 1 launch , and again this week for @entity1			2
" it 's getting better , but it looks like there 's still a lot to do , " @entity9 president and coo @entity14 said			1
" so whether that 's three weeks or three months , i ca n't tell			2
" a week after the site went live , a team of @entity14 's engineers found a slew of out - of - date web applications , poorly written code , testing code and unnecessary data transmitted to users at each login that should have been stored on local servers or computers for quicker access through a process called caching			1
@entity34 passes proposed @entity36 changes all of these mistakes broke with best practices for web coding			0
" they 're not following the proper protocol when you deal with a website that 's going to get a lot of traffic , " @entity14 said on october 8			2
more than a month later , many of these problems still exist			0
" so far , it does not look like much has changed on the front end , " one engineer wrote in his analysis			1
the site is still not properly routing data to servers closer to individual users , a practice that helps speed up response times , but is still sending information to too many unnecessary third - party web tools , although there appear to be fewer than in the early days , he continued			2
it is still loading far too much unnecessary code and there still appears to be needless testing code in the final front - end product			1
obamacare : what now ? @entity68 , the management expert brought in by the @entity34 to oversee the site 's repair , repeated the administration 's assurances that " most users " will be able to navigate from start to enrollment by the end of the month			1
" as we prioritize fixes on @entity3 , we focus on system performance and functionality , things like site stability , speed and usability that make a real difference to the consumer , " @entity78 told reporters on a conference call on friday			1
" but to be clear as you would experience with any major new site , new bugs and other glitches will surface in december and beyond and as they surface we will fix them , " he said			2
two of the engineers who participated in the second analysis wrote that things were getting better			0
the site looks " a lot cleaner , " one wrote , and another noted that there was less extra code than last time he looked			1
" you can tell from the website that there are people working it and making changes , " @entity14 said			0
" and those changes are good			0
there are still many changes they can still make			0
" @entity14 and his team had no special access to the back - end of @entity3 , where most of the functionality problems exist			1
all of these mistakes are visible from the end , @entity14 emphasized , which raises questions about the structure of rest of the site			2
@entity125 : i lost my insurance under @entity36 the @entity129 administration official in charge of overseeing the site , @entity133 director administrator @entity132 , testified at a congressional hearing earlier this month that @entity3 would be " fully functioning " by the end of the month			1
but @entity129 , himself , appeared to lower expectations on thursday when he discussed the issue with reporters			0
" the website will work much better on november 30th , december 1st , than it worked certainly on october 1st , " he said before quickly acknowledging , " that 's a pretty low bar			0
" " the majority of people who go to the website will see a website that is working the way it 's supposed to , " he continued			0
" i think it is not possible for me to guarantee that 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless , smooth experience			0
we 're going to have to continue to improve it even after november 30th , december 1st			0

" it 's getting better but it looks like there 's still a lot to do , " analyst says of @entity3
an engineer writes in his analysis : " it does not look like much has changed on the front end "
site is still loading too much unnecessary code , report says , which is *slowing* it down
