-- if you pressed @entity3 to log on before reading this , @entity1 says he 's sorry			1
the @entity6 founder says the triple - key login should have been made easier , Ãƒ la @entity9 's @entity8 , but that a designer insisted on the more complicated step			1
" we could have had a single button			0
but the guy who did the @entity19 keyboard design did n't want to give us our single button , " @entity1 said saturday during a question - and - answer session to launch a @entity16 fund - raising campaign			1
his comments have gained attention since a video of his @entity16 q&a was posted on @entity25 on tuesday			1
smiling , @entity1 tried to follow through on the thought , noting it was a basic security feature			1
but he eventually surrendered to common sense			0
" and so we had ... we programmed at a low level that you had to ... it was a mistake , " he said , throwing up his hands to laughter and applause from the crowd			2
@entity1 defended innovation on the earliest @entity6 software though			1
" we did some clever stuff , " he said			0
" we were able to experiment with a lot of stuff , but more on the software side than the hardware			0
" long the first interface step for pc users , @entity3 still exists in @entity46 as a way of either locking the computer or accessing the control panel			1
while the system defaults to a log - in screen , users may tweak their settings to return to the old way of logging on to @entity55			0
sometimes informally called the " three - fingered salute , " the login required users to use both hands and was intended to avoid accidental keystrokes from rebooting a computer			2
engineer @entity62 , a designer on early @entity19 computers , said he invented the combination as a shortcut during development			1
" i originally intended for it to be what we would now call an @entity71 -- just something we were using in development and it would n't be available elsewhere , " @entity62 said while appearing on a 2011 panel that included @entity1			2
" but then ( software publishers ) found out about it			0
they were trying to figure out how to tell somebody to start up one of their programs , and they had the answer			0
just put the diskette in , hit @entity3 , and by magic your program starts			2
" he then tried to deflect what he perhaps wryly called " credit " for its continued use			0
" it was like a five - minute job in doing it			0
i did n't realize that i was going to create a cultural icon when i did it , " he said " ... i may have invented it , but i think @entity1 made it famous			1
" a tight - lipped @entity1 appears to force a smile in a video of the panel but does not respond			1
@entity1 attended @entity16 until he left during his junior year to start @entity6 with @entity99 in 1975			1
while at @entity16 , he lived down the hall from current @entity6 ceo @entity101			2
@entity1 received an honorary degree in 2007			2
@entity1 remains @entity6 's chairman although he stopped full - time work at the company in 2008			1
during saturday 's session , @entity1 reflected on a variety of topics , from the philanthropy he 's made his life 's work since stepping back from an active role at @entity6 to his company 's relationship with @entity9 in the early days			1
that included helping keep what would become @entity6 's fiercest rival afloat in the 1990s when it was foundering			0
" in the @entity9 era , we were kind of friendly competitors , " he said			0
" we actually put more people on the @entity8 than @entity9 had			0
" when co-founder @entity125 returned to @entity9 in 1996 , " he sort of says , ' i want this , this and this and i 'll give you this , this and this			0
' ... we did the deal in three days , " @entity1 said			2
that included buying a 6 % share of @entity9 , which lawyers convinced @entity1 that @entity6 should n't keep for antitrust reasons			1
" it would have been nice if we had , " he said .			0
