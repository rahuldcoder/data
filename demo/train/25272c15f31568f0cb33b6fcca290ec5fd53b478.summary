-- it 's one of the greatest @entity3 scandals and 25 years on @entity4 return wednesday to the " crime scene " that resulted in the @entity7 country being banned from the 1994 @entity3			1
it 's a story of brazen deceit and shameless subterfuge and had it not been for the photographic skills of just one man , @entity14 's unimpeachable record of being the only side to have competed at every tournament would have been put into serious jeopardy			1
victory for either @entity14 or @entity4 in their final qualifier at the @entity20 would have taken them to the @entity22			1
with 20 minutes left , @entity14 were 1 - 0 up and looking good for qualification , especially since a draw would also take them through			1
then , their world suddenly fell apart			2
in the @entity4 penalty area , goalkeeper @entity28 was prostrate on the floor , seemingly hit by a flare that was still fizzing and pumping smoke into the sky just inches from him			1
as legendary @entity37 @entity36 , @entity38 and @entity39 looked on , @entity4 's players rushed towards @entity28 -- furiously beckoning the medical staff once they had reached him			1
with the blood leaking from his head turning his jersey crimson , @entity28 was soon carried off the pitch and , as booing filled a bewildered @entity20 , the match officials soon abandoned the game			1
with the flare having been thrown from a @entity37 section of the stadium , football 's greatest superpower -- @entity14 has won the @entity3 five times -- was facing an unprecedented elimination			1
" i was terrorized , " @entity54 , @entity14 captain on the day , told @entity0			1
" i thought immediately of losing the chance to go to the @entity3			2
it was something really bad			2
" now a football agent , @entity58 was working as a pitch - side photographer that day			1
" amazing as it may sound , no tv camera caught the moment the flare flew over and supposedly hit the goalkeeper , " he told @entity0			1
" we photographers were sitting along the side line and saw the flare come over			2
i was amazed to see @entity28 rolling over and bleeding from an eye , as the device had hit the ground about a meter from him			2
" with neither tv nor photographic evidence to prove otherwise , @entity14 were in deep trouble but , wholly unbeknown to them , they were on the wrong side of an enormous hoax			1
in a planned incident , @entity28 -- a highly - respected goalkeeper who was playing for @entity37 side @entity78 at the time -- had used a razor blade hidden in his gloves to cut his own head while lying on the floor			1
it was the most machiavellian play to ensure @entity14 's elimination , but no one in @entity14 had any hope of proving that			1
unless evidence could be found			2
" now of course -- with all the cameras on mobile phones around -- it would have been impossible , " said @entity54			2
" i missed the shot and so did most of the photographers , " recalled @entity58			0
" but there was one guy by me -- @entity100 , a good friend -- and i asked him : ' @entity54 , did you capture the flare ? ' he said : ' of course , about 4 - 5 shots			2
' " @entity58 immediately realized the huge significance of the shots but in an age when cameras recorded images onto slides , rather than digitally , obstacles remained			0
" @entity54 had a problem			0
he was on assignment for a @entity118 magazine and had to send the films to @entity120 -- unprocessed -- the next morning , and the @entity118 would only trust their laboratory , " recalled @entity113 of his fellow photographer , who now works for the @entity7 governing body @entity115			2
" i said to @entity54 : ' listen , you are the only one to have the evidence that @entity28 is lying and cheating			0
i wo n't let you out of my country with those films unprocessed			2
' " just after the game had been abandoned , @entity58 had watched aghast as a @entity4 pundit told a local radio station how he had seen the flare hit @entity28 , so turning the knife into @entity14 's unprotected back			1
" so i found the radio reporter and told him @entity54 had the shots			0
he put @entity134 live on air and the whole atmosphere changed , " @entity58 recalled			0
" ten minutes later , @entity37 football president @entity137 [ no relation ] walked into the dressing room where we were			0
he was livid -- his face white , black , red , yellow -- all colors			0
" ' who has the films ? ' he asked			0
i have them , i answered			0
i was the biggest asset on earth at that point and @entity58 was always asking if i was sure about the shots			0
but i knew i could rely on @entity100 's word , because he was the best			2
" so began a frantic -- and equally anxious -- scramble to see if the images really proved that @entity28 had cheated			0
" it took four hours to warm up and prepare the laboratory			0
the lab lady was furious -- having been dragged out of her sunday to work at night , " @entity58 said			0
while the lab was heating up , so were the deliberations over which agency would get the pictures			0
with one baulking at @entity58 's demand for five thousand dollars , the famous @entity164 network agreed to stump up the sum for the images			2
" when the pictures came out , there were four clear shots -- starting with the device flying and then landing one meter away from @entity28			0
( @entity172 president ) @entity58 was so relieved , " said the agent @entity58			0
on the monday evening , @entity164 ran the scoop -- showing pictures that proved @entity28 ' play - acting -- in a program called " @entity178 " , a copy of which @entity172 boss @entity58 showed to @entity180 after flying to their headquarters in @entity183			0
satisfied by the documentary evidence , football 's world governing body awarded @entity14 a 2 - 0 technical victory that duly took the nation to the 1990 finals			1
@entity180 ruled that @entity4 had broken the regulation of leaving the pitch before a game 's conclusion and then issued a final judgment , suspended @entity4 from the 1994 @entity3			1
the world governing body also issued a life ban to @entity28 from playing football , with @entity4 's coach and team doctor receiving a similar ban			1
then just 32 , @entity28 could continue to work in football however and as he licked his wounds back home in @entity4 , help came from an unexpected source -- @entity14 itself			1
" in 1993 , @entity78 coach @entity208 and the club president traveled to the @entity4 capital @entity211 to ask @entity28 to work at the club as the goalkeeping trainer , " @entity207 , his wife , told @entity0			1
@entity28 declined an interview request on the grounds of poor health			0
the 56 - year - old , whose @entity180 ban was lifted in 2001 , has been awaiting a liver transplant for three years now , after contracting @entity220 , and underwent a five - hour operation in march to relieve the accumulation of fluid in his lungs , according to @entity207			0
despite his elaborate attempts to deny @entity37 what they consider to be their sporting birth right ( i.e. playing at the @entity3 ) , @entity207 says @entity28 receives no animosity as they live their life in @entity78			0
" here in @entity14 , @entity28 has always been loved , " she said			1
" the most important thing for @entity37 is that he has , in his interviews , come across as a human being with a very distinct and good character			0
he has admitted his guilt and been forgiven			0
" he showed his strength of character through his work and after training ( @entity78 ) goalkeeper @entity240 to be one of the best , @entity28 also coached @entity78 for a brief spell from 2003 -- qualifying the team for the @entity244			2
" @entity207 's sentiments are backed up by former @entity14 captain @entity54 , who bears no malice towards a man who could have stolen his only chance of playing in the @entity3 finals			1
" i met @entity28 many years later and he admitted his mistakes			0
he is not naughty but that day , he had a lapse -- a really bad decision , " @entity54 said			0
" @entity4 had a plan which they had prepared and it was unbelievable , truly unbelievable			1
" the strangest thing is they had a good team			0
" on wednesday , @entity4 are back in the @entity20 as they continue their @entity263 campaign with their second group game against @entity265			1
given @entity265 lost their first game , while @entity4 won their opener it should be a cracker -- but hopefully without the fireworks of the 1989 game .			1
