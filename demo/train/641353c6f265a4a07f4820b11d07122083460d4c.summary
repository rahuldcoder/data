-- while @entity1 signed @entity2 in the summer 's highest - profile football transfer and added several other big names , @entity6 fans were left largely underwhelmed by the @entity9 champion 's moves in the off - season			1
they might be even more disappointed after learning how much @entity6 made in its last fiscal year -- and therefore had to spend			1
the record 20 - time league winner in @entity14 -- self described as " one of the most popular and successful sports teams in the world " -- announced record revenues of $ 580 million for the year ended june 30 , 2013 and said commercial revenues soared to a record $ 244 million			1
it left executive vice-chairman @entity21 , who replaced @entity22 in the @entity6 hierarchy , to declare on @entity6 's website : " it has been a little over a year since our ipo ( initial public offering ) and in that time we have delivered on our targets and objectives			2
" our commercial business continues to be a very powerful engine of growth enabling the team to continue to be successful			0
" but @entity6 , in its first season without legendary manager @entity36 , was largely quiet under new boss @entity37 and @entity38 as it defends its @entity9 title , signing just @entity40 and relatively unknown @entity42 @entity41			1
@entity6 was linked with @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 -- who all stayed put with their current clubs			1
" it 's been pretty disappointing , " said @entity50 , a @entity6 supporter who tweets about football finances			2
" i do n't think it 's @entity37 ' fault			0
he gives his targets to the club			0
i do n't think he should be held accountable at all			0
" meanwhile , city rival @entity57 bought four key players prior to august , @entity56 swooped for the likes of @entity60 and @entity61 and @entity62 smashed its transfer record by purchasing @entity64 from @entity1 for more than $ 65 million			1
@entity65 splashed out on more than half - a - dozen stars , attempting to make up for the loss of @entity2			0
" @entity6 's commercial acumen is n't of value because it does n't lead to a bigger stadium , lower ticket prices or better players , " said @entity50			1
" you have all these commercial deals but it 's no benefit to the football club			0
" @entity6 has made a lukewarm start to the league season , winning two of its four games , although it began its @entity82 campaign with a win tuesday against @entity84			0
@entity6 is " delighted to have @entity37 lead our football team into a new and exciting chapter , " @entity21 said			2
" we look forward to a successful 2013/14 , both on and off the pitch			0

@entity6 announces a club record annual revenue of $ 580 million
the @entity9 champion also says *sponsorship* revenue *increased* 44 *percent*
but most @entity6 fans are disappointed the team did n't *buy* more players in the summer
@entity6 was linked with @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45
