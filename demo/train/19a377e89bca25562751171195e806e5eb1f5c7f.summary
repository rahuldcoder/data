-- dear @entity1 , i was a 12 - year - old girl living in the center of @entity4 , @entity5 , in @entity6			1
music was all around us , with the traditional singers and their drums and with the radio blasting songs from the entire world			1
singing had always been my passion			1
my mom even told me i sung before i spoke			1
one day , i discovered an uplifting song that made everyone dance			1
it was called " @entity21			1
" the power and beauty of the voice singing it mesmerized me			1
i had to get the 45 rpm single right away			2
that 's when i first heard the name of @entity29 , the famous @entity30 singer			2
i also learned her struggle against apartheid and her success all over the planet			2
even though at home i could see the respect that my father had for my mom , i could feel the world was unbalanced and that it was so hard for girls and women to succeed			1
many of my girlfriends at school were dropping out at an early age as the social pressure was huge			2
most of them could not choose their own destiny			2
it was as if they would always be the daughter , the wife or the mother of someone			2
but looking at @entity29 's smile on the cover , her confidence and the respect she inspired , i started to dream			2
if an exiled @entity30 woman born from a poor family had been able to accomplish so much , there might be a little chance for me to follow her steps			0
lost in my thoughts , lying on my bed , listening to her music for hours , learning by heart the lyrics of all her songs -- in my imagination , i was already traveling with her , singing with her , meeting world leaders and advocating with her for the freedom of her people			1
that dream has never left me			0
i grew up and i experienced much rejection , many obstacles , but @entity29 's voice was always singing in my head			0
i started to have some success singing on the national radio			0
one day , on the way back from school , a group of teenagers recognized me and insulted me , calling me a whore because i was a singer			0
i came back home , crying , and wanted to give up singing for good			0
@entity92 , my maternal grandmother , happened to be home			0
she asked me why i was crying so much			0
once i explained , she gave me a piece of advice that i have never forgotten and that i want you to remember when you feel your dreams are shattered			0
she told me : " do you want to be a singer ? " " yes , @entity99 " " then , you ca n't let the opinion of other people discourage you			1
do n't give up on your dreams , do n't allow them to define who you are or they would have won ! " many years passed			1
i left my country like @entity29 had done			0
i worked hard , listening to constructive critics and ignoring the naysayers , keeping @entity29 's songs close to my heart			0
then , in a different decade , in a different country , the day finally came when i was asked to sing as the opening act of my beloved idol			0
i could not believe it			0
please remember girls : do n't let anyone define who you are ! -- @entity118 more : @entity0 's " @entity119 " read more open letters open letter from @entity122 : it 's time to power the world open letter from @entity127 @entity126 : more than tiaras and cupcakes how to help take action with 10x10			1
