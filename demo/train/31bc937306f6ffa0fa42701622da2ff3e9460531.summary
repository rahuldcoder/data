@entity0 -- three one - time insiders at the defunct @entity4 tabloid testified monday before a @entity7 government - backed panel investigating press ethics and behavior			1
former chief reporter @entity10 -- who has been arrested in connection with a police probe into phone hacking -- said he would not talk about illegal eavesdropping because of the arrest			1
he has not been charged			0
he appeared at the @entity17 after the paper 's most famous undercover reporter , @entity18 , known as the " fake sheikh " for the disguise he often adopted to get stories			2
he described doing stories on prostitution and drug dealing , but insisted repeatedly the tabloid " never engaged in entrapment			0
" he defended his methodology , saying criminals had gone to prison because of his work			0
" exposing criminality gives me great satisfaction , " said @entity18 , whose appearance was not televised in order to protect his identity			0
but he said he had never heard about phone hacking by the @entity4 until royal reporter @entity38 was arrested for it in 2006			1
the inquiry was prompted by widespread public outrage this summer at the revelation that the @entity44 - owned tabloid had hacked into the voice mail of a murdered 13 - year - old girl in 2002			1
@entity44 's son @entity47 , the chief executive of the @entity49 subsidiary that published the tabloid , has repeatedly denied knowing about the scale of illegal eavesdropping at his papers			2
@entity54 ordered the paper shut down over the scandal			0
former @entity4 deputy editor @entity57 also testified monday			0
like @entity10 , he has been arrested and released on bail in a police investigation into phone hacking			1
he argued that @entity7 's downmarket tabloids were the " ones that people out there want to read , " and far outsold so - called quality papers such as the @entity65 and the @entity66			1
a former @entity4 journalist testified last month that the editors of the tabloid knew that their reporters were hacking phones in search of stories			0
@entity77 named @entity78 , who went on to become an adviser to @entity7 prime minister @entity80 , and @entity81 , a @entity44 protege , as editors who were aware of the practice			2
@entity78 resigned as editor of the tabloid in 2007 when @entity38 went to prison for hacking the voice mails of prince @entity90 's staff , and he later became @entity80 's communications director			2
@entity78 has always denied knowing about phone hacking , saying he quit the paper because he was ultimately responsible for the actions of his staff			1
the @entity17 has been hearing from high - profile figures since last month , including celebrities such as " @entity99 " author @entity98 and actor @entity100 , both of whom complained about press intrusion into their lives			0
police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people , including celebrities , crime victims , politicians and members of the royal family , were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories			1
it involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a pin to access messages remotely .			0
