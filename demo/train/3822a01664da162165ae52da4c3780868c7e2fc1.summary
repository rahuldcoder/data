-- @entity2 's giant pandas are believed to be safe after monday 's earthquake , but concern is growing over how they will get their next meals			1
the giant pandas ' primary food source is bamboo			1
authorities confirmed tuesday that captive animals in two of @entity2 's major panda reserves were alive , according to @entity14 , @entity2 's official news agency			1
the @entity15 in southwest @entity17 province is home to about 86 giant pandas , who were reported safe tuesday			1
staff and critters at neighboring @entity23 and @entity24 were also reported safe , according to a spokesperson for the @entity26 , which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve			1
@entity30 arose in the international wildlife community over damage to the animals ' habitat , as authorities continued assessing the scope of damage in the @entity17 province			2
the mountainous , densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild , making it an obvious location for research bases like @entity45 and @entity46			1
giant pandas roam the forest in " open cages " that are meant to provide them with a safe , natural environment that will prepare them for release			1
with the safety of the pandas confirmed , the animals ' caregivers are left to determine how resources like food and medical supplies will reach the bases , which contain breeding facilities and triage centers			2
@entity64 , the pandas ' primary source of food , is a major agricultural product in the region , but whether it can be supplied to the pandas despite infrastructure damage is open to question			2
" @entity45 is hard to access under normal conditions , so the heavy road damage makes it even harder , " said @entity71 , spokesperson for the @entity72			0
@entity71 said @entity72 had confirmed the safety of staff based in @entity77 , but had not received word on the conditions in @entity45			0
she said the @entity72 was also concerned about members who had been touring the country when the earthquake struck			0
so far , the group has not been located			0
scientists in the @entity85 are hopeful that @entity2 researchers will adapt to the situation facing them			2
@entity88 with the @entity90 's @entity89 in @entity91 says that scientists in @entity45 have overcome threats to the giant panda population before			0
in the late 1990s , the captive giant panda population was in decline , with more animals dying than were born , @entity88 said			1
thanks to a collaborative effort with @entity85 scientists , the @entity45 staff was able to reverse the trend			0
" our @entity2 colleagues are very perceptive when it comes to addressing problems , " said @entity88 , who has visited wolong many times as part of the @entity90 's affiliation with the research base			2
" because of their efforts , the population is on the rise today			0
" @entity88 said that @entity2 scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources before			1
" artificial diets in the form of protein biscuits have been created for giant pandas			1
they 're not a complete substitute , but they meet the needs of a basic high - fiber diet , " said @entity88 , who has worked with two pandas that the @entity90 has on loan from @entity45			0
" right now , we 're mostly concerned about the staff			0
if the staff is fine , then the animals will be fine , " @entity88 said .			0

report : @entity2 authorities confirm that captive giant pandas are safe
concerns grow over road accessibility to the reserves
scientist : alternative foods exist in the event of depleted bamboo stocks
