@entity0 -- president @entity2 pledged to stamp out the gremlins plaguing his administration 's signature health - care overhaul monday , saying there was no " sugarcoating " the difficulties faced by @entity8 hoping to sign up for insurance coverage online			1
" nobody 's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should , which means it 's going to get fixed , " @entity2 said during an appearance at the @entity11			1
but he did n't specify exactly what went wrong or who was to blame for the problems , which include long waits to log onto the federally administered website and maddeningly long wait times once online			1
there 's " no excuse for the problems , " @entity2 said			1
but he said tech industry experts were being brought in to help workers going 24/7 to fix the site , @entity28 , which went live october 1			1
and he pointed out that the site is n't the only way to buy coverage			0
" you can bypass the website and apply by phone or in person , " he said			2
" so do n't let problems with the website deter you from signing up or signing your family up or showing your friends how to sign up , because it is worth it			2
it will save you money			0
" a standoff with congressional @entity45 over government spending and raising the federal borrowing limit -- triggered by @entity45 efforts to defund the program -- distracted public attention from the problems of the new health care system , popularly known as @entity53			1
but with that standoff over , the @entity45 has turned its fire back onto the problems faced by the website and onto @entity58 secretary @entity57 , calling for her to resign			1
@entity57 attended monday 's @entity11 remarks , and the @entity61 announced that she was expected to testify at an october 30 hearing on the cause of the problems			1
the committee is already scheduled to hold a hearing on thursday , with website and administrative contractors @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 set to testify on their roles in the situation			1
@entity57 had been invited to this week 's hearing but had a scheduling conflict , her office said			1
@entity78 spokesman @entity77 defended the program on @entity1 's " @entity80 , " saying that while @entity28 is struggling , the administration 's health care reform " is not failing			1
" people who are able to submit applications through whatever means are happy with the results , he said			0
" health insurance provides security that a lot of these families have n't had in the past , " @entity77 said			0
have you had trouble signing up ? let us know @entity2 said " the essence of the law " -- aimed at providing access to health insurance for the roughly 48 million @entity8 without it -- " is working just fine			2
" " in some cases , actually , it 's exceeding expectations			0
the prices are lower than expected , and the choice is greater than we expected , " he said			2
" but the problem has been that the website that 's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody , " he continued			2
" there 's no sugarcoating it			0
the website has been too slow			2
people are getting stuck during the application process			0
" and in a shot at the law 's critics , he said , " it 's time for folks to stop rooting for its failure , because hardworking middle class families are rooting for its success			0
" but rep. @entity128 , @entity129 , told @entity1 that his staffers were trying to sign up via @entity28 while @entity2 was speaking , " and the website did n't work			1
" " this is one of those areas where the president 's not going to be able to hide behind the rhetoric , " said @entity128 , who supported the failed @entity45 effort to halt the program			0
@entity28 : what works , what does n't other @entity45 kept up their attacks on the health care reforms on monday , with the office of senate minority leader @entity143 tweeting that when a visit to the @entity53 website made a trip to the @entity150 seem pleasant , " it 's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort			1
" a @entity153 / @entity152 poll released monday showed that 56 % of respondents consider the website difficulties a harbinger of broader problems with the @entity53 , a constant target of conservative critics who consider it the epitome of big government overreach			1
@entity2 administration officials have highlighted the fact that nearly 500,000 people have filled out applications for @entity53 , though the number who purchased coverage remains unknown			1
initial difficulties have started to ease for logging on to the website for the new exchanges , some of which are run by states and others by the federal government			2
but problems now are occurring further along the process , with insurance industry sources having said they are getting some applications with missing information			0
the application portion of the website was brought down this weekend for overnight maintenance , as it has been on previous weekends and some weeknights			0
" to ensure that we make swift progress , and that the consumer experience continues to improve , our team has called in additional help to solve some of the more complex technical issues we are encountering , " the @entity58 department said in a blog post sunday			0
" our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve @entity28			1
" logging in tough for some early registrants the administration is still not releasing the numbers on how many people have taken the next step of enrolling : choosing a specific health care plan			0
the administration has said it will do that monthly , so the first tally of enrollment numbers will come in november			0
the @entity205 has said it expects 7 million people to enroll by april 1			0
although march 31 is the deadline for people to get health insurance or face a fine , officials warn that failure to sign up by february 15 could be a problem because of the time needed for the coverage to take effect			0
@entity77 told reporters on monday afternoon that lingering problems in signing people up could result in relief , noting that the law makes clear that " if you do not have access to affordable health insurance , you will not have to pay a penalty for not having affordable health insurance			0
" hope for a smoother ride on @entity28 he also repeated the president 's assertion that high demand in the first weeks of the new exchanges contributed to the website problems , noting that the larger - than - expected response exposed existing " glitches and kinks			1
" although the administration tally of applications did not break down how many of the applications came through state - run exchanges , a @entity1 survey of officials with those exchanges found that at least 257,000 people had signed up for new insurance plans as of friday afternoon			0
not all of them had made a payment , and not every state responded to the @entity1 request			0
a @entity250 article last week offered tips for people trying to sign up , but had the following advice for those overwhelmed by the difficulties : " if all this is too much for you to absorb , follow our previous advice : stay away from @entity28 for at least another month if you can			1
hopefully that will be long enough for its software vendors to clean up the mess they 've made			0
" but in a statement issued monday night , the group said its criticism of the website does n't mean it now opposes the @entity53			1
critics of @entity53 are misrepresenting the nonprofit organization 's position , @entity268 said			2
5 things that have happened since @entity53 launched @entity1 's @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .			2

new : @entity53 " is not failing " despite website woes , @entity78 spokesman says
@entity2 says @entity28 problems are " going to get fixed "
@entity57 expected to testify at a congressional hearing next week
