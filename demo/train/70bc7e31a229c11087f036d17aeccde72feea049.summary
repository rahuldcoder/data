@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 launched its @entity5 rocket wednesday , after multiple delays over two days because of bad weather			1
the 327 - foot rocket -- which @entity3 considers the world 's largest -- took off at 11:30 a.m. et , 30 minutes before a noon deadline for the launch			1
it rose about 24 miles			0
about two minutes after liftoff , the first - stage , reusable rocket booster fell into the @entity15 , where it was to be picked up by a ship			1
it was the first flight test for the @entity19 , @entity3 's next - generation spacecraft and launch vehicle system			1
the rocket 's launch is part of @entity3 's mission to someday return astronauts to the moon and later travel to @entity28			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity29 , who was moderating the launch preparations for broadcasters , communicated the frustration as launches were repeatedly called off with just minutes to go			1
after 11 a.m. , it appeared there would be a narrow window for a liftoff , and a half - hour later the rocket roared skyward			1
" i ca n't tell you how proud i am of all of you , " @entity39 , @entity5 launch director , told engineers and others inside the center after the launch			1
" that was just one of the most beautiful rocket launches i 've ever seen			1
" " it shows what we can do when we have a common goal			2
" as the clock ticked toward noon , @entity3 officials nervously awaited all - clears for technical items and a weather clearance from weather officer @entity58 who , time and again , said conditions were " red , " meaning a no - go			1
a reconnaissance plane was giving her frequent weather reports			2
she kept looking for a break in the high - level clouds			2
" it 's a very dynamic situation , " @entity58 said			0
before the launch , the space agency had begun negotiating with the @entity69 to see if a thursday launch attempt was possible			1
failing that , @entity3 could n't have tried again until november 16			0
@entity3 's primary concern was the high - level , cold clouds that can cause triboelectrification , or the production of a kind of static electricity , similar to what happens when you walk across a carpet , then touch something			0
if static surrounds the rocket , it can interfere with radio signals sent by or to the rocket			0
the @entity19 has been developing new vehicles to replace space shuttles , which will be phased out in 2010			0
if the program moves forward , the @entity89 capsule atop the @entity91 rocket will not be ready to take astronauts into space until at least 2015 , leaving a gap of at least five years in which the only way the @entity97 would be able to put humans in orbit would be by hitching a ride with the @entity101			1
part of the test rocket mission is for scientists to try out three massive main parachutes , measuring 150 feet in diameter and weighing one ton each -- the largest rocket parachutes ever manufactured			0
the parachutes are a primary element of the rocket 's deceleration system , @entity3 says			0
after the rocket is successfully launched , the parachutes are to open at the same time , " providing the drag necessary to slow the descent of the huge solid rocket motor for a soft landing in the ocean , " the agency says on its web site			0
the two parts of the rocket are to separate at about 130,000 feet			0
the top of the rocket , known as the upper stage , includes a mock @entity89 crew capsule and a launch abort system			2
the upper stage will continue its ascent until gravity forces its return to @entity132 , after which it will fall into the @entity15			0
the launch comes at a critical time , when @entity3 is waiting for president @entity135 to decide future funding for the agency			0
an independent committee reviewing the future of space flight recently reported that the @entity97 space program appears to be pursuing goals that exceed current funding			2
the committee also recommended to the @entity145 that funding for @entity3 's under - construction international space station should be extended until 2020			2
@entity2 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0
