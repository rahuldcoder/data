@entity0 , @entity1 -- vacationers were the first to notice the bird fumbling in the water near this popular tourist beach last week			1
it bobbed and swayed differently than other birds , and did n't react when humans came dangerously close			2
once it was ashore , they could see why : a light sheen of oil covered its feathers			1
animal health technician @entity15 tried to rescue the @entity17 , but beach safety officers stopped her			2
her coworkers at the @entity20 already had stabilized birds and a sea turtle affected by the @entity24 oil disaster , but officials wanted to know : did she have a contract with @entity27 ? could she -- and the bird -- wait while they verified her organization 's status ? " they 're trying to do their job , " @entity15 said as she crouched over the motionless bird , wrapped in a white sheet and barely hidden from the stares of kids and parents			1
" they have to make sure protocol is followed			0
" when brown clumps of tar began to wash up on the snow - white beaches around @entity46 last week , the mood in this sunny beach community shifted from optimistic denial to furious worry			1
local ideas about how to protect the area clashed with plans from @entity27 , state and federal agencies			1
community volunteers struggling to cut through protocol cheered a decision by @entity57 to defy @entity27 and the feds			1
they 'd use their own plans			1
we 'll take the heat			0
we would do whatever it took to stop the oil , " said the county commission chairman , @entity64			1
after months of wrangling with agencies responding to the spill , @entity64 was n't willing to stake the county 's ecology and economy only on boom that captures or absorbs oil			1
the commission authorized emergency management teams to add skimmers , barges and extra boom , and an air wall they hope will push the oil away			1
they plan to layer prevention measures in the pass that connects the @entity24 to @entity86 , where fresh and salt water mix and dolphins play			0
@entity64 said the plan could cost up to $ 6 million per month , which he hopes will be covered by money from @entity27			0
the county developed its oil plan in the days after the disaster began to unfold , but it was plagued by miscommunications , disagreements and bureaucracy once it left local hands , @entity64 said			1
communities along the @entity100 have made similar complaints			0
mayors grilled a @entity27 official about the response during a press conference earlier this month			0
in @entity107 , @entity108 , locals went outside the federal plan and risked incarceration by adding boom and barges to protect @entity113			0
in @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity114 pitched in to string boom near an island where many of their ancestors are buried			0
@entity64 said some of his county 's efforts may work ; others may not			1
" doing something is better than doing nothing , " he said			0
on the @entity0 beach , local response to the oiled @entity128 was quicker , but the federal response had less red tape to work through			2
@entity134 @entity133 workers arrived before @entity15 's status was verified , so she left their bird in their care			0
" time is essential with these guys , " she said			0
" for the rest of @entity57 , more boom and barges were starting to appear in the water			1
the county commission vote was " smart , " and sped up the state and federal response , said public safety director @entity147 , who was quickly invited to an " olive branch " meeting in @entity149			1
most of the county 's preferred plans are moving forward , @entity147 said , and they 'll continue to adapt as the oil moves throughout their waters			1
@entity64 said the plans would have gone forward even without approval from @entity27 or other government agencies			1
" i 'm sure they 're cussing			0
i 'm sure they 're cussing us bad , " @entity64 said			0
" if we had waited , we 'd still be waiting			0
why did it take us giving an ultimatum ? " @entity164 , a @entity164 commander in @entity149 , said some communities decided to implement their own plans once they saw they did n't top the list of state and federal priorities , if they were on the list at all			2
some just wanted to act before the mess -- and response agencies ' attention -- began to move their way			0
now that oil is reaching @entity1 's shores , resources are shifting there , @entity164 said , and there 's a plan to meet with @entity0 commissioners this week			1
" now is the time to make sure these relationships are still working and strong and the lines of communication are open , " he said			0
the commission 's vote marked a turning point for @entity57 residents and vacationers			1
even as oil crippled fishing , tourism and ecology in @entity116 , @entity108 and @entity194 , wishful thinkers hoped for the best around @entity46 , which calls itself the " @entity197			2
" " i 'm guilty of it			0
every day something does n't happen , you walk down your beach and do n't see it , the feeling gets stronger -- until it arrives , " @entity57 's beach safety division chief @entity200 said as he picked gummy tar balls from the sand			1
it 's almost like grieving			0
this is the destination , white , sandy beaches			2
" june is typically a busy month along the area known as @entity1 's @entity218			1
beaches in @entity46 and @entity220 are usually packed with families freed from school and work , and the water is crammed with boats			2
but when traces of oil actually arrived last week , clean - up crews were on land and familiar local fishermen wore life jackets , a tell - tale sign they were called into service for @entity27			1
tourist rentals already were down as much as 50 percent , county officials said			2
shops were quiet , service jobs were cut back and only a few umbrellas and towels were scattered across the soft sand			0
no oil - related illnesses or injuries had been reported as of late last week , said @entity243 , a community health worker for @entity57			1
a health advisory warned beachgoers against swimming one day last week , but it was lifted hours later			2
the arrival of oil spooked residents , and made clear the conflicts between local action and @entity27 's response			1
on the boardwalk at @entity0 , volunteers cleaned up after a group of campers made oil - absorbing boom from hosiery and animal hair			2
boom makers yente @entity260 and @entity261 said they 'd prefer boom made with renewable resources in the water around @entity57 's beaches , and as oil came closer , more materials and volunteers had showed up to help their efforts			1
in a warehouse nearby , the pair stacked human and animal hair donations funneled through the non-profit matter of @entity274 and postmarked from @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279			0
volunteers packed dog and alpaca hair clippings into the legs of pantyhose , then tied them off and strung them into mesh casings with plastic pieces that float in the water			0
already , more than 5,000 boom were stacked inside the warehouse			0
county officials said they do n't want to discourage volunteers , but they are n't planning to use the animal hair boom , except as a last resort			2
@entity260 's phone was busy with calls from local business owners and real estate agents who wanted the boom to protect their businesses , but organizers ca n't give the boom away without county approval and a clear plan for its disposal			1
" we live in paradise and everybody wants to believe it 's not going to happen to us , " @entity261 said			0
" it 's turning into anger and frustration			0
@entity27 , local government , state government , everybody sitting around waiting for someone else to do something			0
we want to help , but we ca n't			0
" still , the women said they wo n't stop their boom - making effort , especially as more community members notice the empty beaches studded with tar balls and look for ways to get involved			1
" once we started , no way , " @entity260 said			0
" i 'm very proud to live in this county at this point in time			2
people of this county are going to do what they want to do			2

residents and vacationers in @entity57 in @entity1 are starting to spot tar balls and oiled *wildlife* on their beaches .
county commissioners voted to respond to the oil spill with their own plans , regardless of whether unified command approved .
unified command sped up approval of their plans and will meet with commissioners this week .
