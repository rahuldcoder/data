-- curious about how a disease gets started ? researchers may soon be able to " street view " the inner workings of the human body			1
an international group of researchers have successfully created the most comprehensive map of the human metabolism , called @entity11 , which details how the body 's converts food into energy , and assembles all of the hormones and proteins that contribute to a normal day 's work for cells and tissues			1
genes may form the foundation of the human condition , but it 's their activity , in the shape of the products they make â € ” from enzymes and hormones to nutrients and signaling factors â € ” that dictate how cells interact with each other , and how body systems , such as the way we breakdown food into energy , operate			2
" it 's like having the coordinates of all the cars in town , but no street map , " @entity41 , a professor of bioengineering at the @entity43 said in a statement			2
" without this tool , we do n't know why people are moving the way they are			2
" by putting together how genes and their products interact across entire networks , @entity41 and his colleagues are confident that @entity11 could help to expose some of the still mysterious causes of diseases like cancer and diabetes , as well as lead to better treatments			1
@entity0 : can you be fat and fit ? " ultimately , i envision it being used to personalize diagnosis and treatment to meet the needs of individual patients			0
in the future , this capability could enable doctors to develop virtual models of their patients ' individual metabolic networks and identify the most efficacious treatment for various diseases including diabetes , cancer and neurodegenerative diseases , " said @entity66 , a professor at the @entity67 in a statement describing the work			0
recon 2 resembles a " @entity92 map " since it consolidates all the details of human metabolism functions into one interactive tool and allows users to zoom in to view as much detail , at a cellular level , as they want , or to zoom out to get a broader perspective of all the different metabolic reactions that might be involved in a particular function			1
such analyses can reveal patterns in function that might not otherwise be obvious to scientists working on more limited projects			0
in a release describing the scope of the project , @entity43 officials wrote : " this is not unlike how you can get a street view of a single house or zoom out to see how the house fits into the whole neighborhood , city , state , country and globe			0
and just as @entity112 brings together a broad set of data -- such as images , addresses , streets and traffic flow -- into an easily navigated tool , @entity11 pulls together a vast compendium of data from published literature and existing models of metabolic processes			1
" @entity0 : how exercise can change your dna as the name suggests , there was also a recon 1 , which mapped 3,300 metabolic transformations occurring in tissue and cells			0
recon 2 more than doubles that number of metabolic activities by covering more than 7,400 different reactions			0
to develop @entity140 , the original group of researchers from @entity43 brought together research groups from around the world to contribute their findings and develop standards for the map			2
researchers are already excited by @entity11 2â € ²s potential in a number of medical applications , including the ability to trace gene expression patterns to specific metabolic pathways , which can lead to more useful targets for drugs that can intervene in these processes and alter the reactions that can lead to disease			2
" @entity11 allows biomedical researchers to study the human metabolic network with more precision than was ever previously possible			1
this is essential to understanding where and how specific metabolic pathways go off track to create disease , " said @entity41 in a statement			0
@entity0 : diet strategies may help in lowering diabetes risk although it is the most expansive map of the human metabolism available , it 's still not complete			1
according to the researchers , @entity11 includes only about 1,800 genes of the estimated 20,000 protein - coding genes in the human genome , so there is plenty more to map in coming years			1
the study was published in the journal @entity177			0

researchers have created the most comprehensive map of the human metabolism
they hope it will help expose some of the still mysterious causes of diseases
