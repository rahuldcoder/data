-- there are books -- and then there are books			2
and this one does n't come cheap			2
so if you love @entity8 and want to spend a year following the likes of @entity10 and @entity11 across the world , this is the only book for you -- if you have a spare million dollars			1
weighing 37 kilograms , this 852 - page book will come with the opportunity for its owner to hold four passes to every single day of each grand prix weekend during the 2014 season , access into the team paddocks and even tea with @entity8 supremo @entity21			1
up for auction in december , with three bids already secured , " the @entity27 " also comes with a signature sheet adorned with the original autographs of the 22 f1 world champions			1
" this book gives you the opportunity to experience @entity8 like never before , " @entity29 chief executive officer @entity28 told @entity0			1
" you can go to every single race across the world , take in all three days , go into the paddocks , have a drink and see the drivers			2
" you 'll get to spend time with mr @entity21 and have a sporting experience you could n't get anywhere else			2
" a former banker , @entity28 set up @entity29 in 2007 and has since crafted a number of other books which have focused on the likes of @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
but the @entity21 -- arriving in its carbon - fiber case , gleaming like a piece of treasure waiting to be plundered -- takes the concept to an altogether new level			1
" we 've already had three serious bids for the book , " @entity28 revealed			1
" we always thought that the bids would come from two areas -- wealthy individuals who are looking to have some fun and great experiences or from corporate businesses			1
" we 've had one bid from a banking entity , one from a hedge fund and another from a @entity69 investment company			2
" for a business , this is a great investment , especially if you have offices all over the world			0
you could take three different clients each day for three days on each weekend and you can do that 20 times a year			0
" that 's great for networking and business			0
it 's a huge opportunity			0
" whoever finally ends up winning the auction will also be able to sell individual races with @entity28 estimating that the lure of the @entity85 could go for as much as $ 100,000			1
the book has been nearly six years in the making with @entity28 working with @entity21 to produce arguably the most definitive look at @entity8			1
beginning at the start of the @entity91 in 1950 , the book charts the course of the sport , taking in those who are synonymous with the roaring engines of the sport			1
it takes in each and every circuit in detail , gives an insight into the colorful characters who entertained fans such as @entity104 and @entity105 before moving on to @entity106 , @entity107 and current four - time world champion @entity10			1
chasing the 22 different signatures of @entity8 champions did n't prove easy			0
@entity28 had two men flying across the world for two years to collect every autograph			0
they flew to @entity113 to obtain @entity115 's signature , secured @entity116 's in @entity117 and managed to catch @entity118 in @entity119			0
as well as the one - off edition , there are also 1500 copies of the silk - covered $ 3,200 " classic " which will be signed by @entity21 , with the $ 32,000 " champions " edition accompanied by autographs of every single @entity8 world champion			1
perhaps @entity21 's involvement in the book has proved a welcome distraction from his ongoing legal problems			2
he has denied making corrupt payments to a @entity134 banker to facilitate the sale @entity8 , testifying for four days in @entity137 's @entity136 before heading to this weekend 's @entity138 @entity85 in @entity139			0
" working with mr @entity21 is a combination of him being highly demanding , fun and challenging , " added @entity28			0
" you have to be on the ball because he always is			0
his attention to detail is phenomenal			0
" he really bought into what we were trying to do which was present the sport on scale where all the iconic images are seen how they were meant to be seen			0
" in 99.9 % of the books , pictures have been heavily cropped			0
we want to show them in the way the photographer wanted them to be shown			0
