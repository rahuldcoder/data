-- in case you 've avoided reading what may be the more depressing reports in the history of the natural world , the awful take - away is basically this : half the animals of planet earth have disappeared since 1970 , and much of it is the fault of humans			1
yep , you read that right			0
half of the world 's vertebrate animal populations are gone			1
and it happened in only the span of two generations , according the @entity20 , which was published on tuesday by the environmental group @entity21 , in collaboration with the @entity23 , @entity24 and the @entity25			1
" in other words , " the report says , " vertebrate species populations across the globe are , on average , about half the size they were 40 years ago			1
" ^ % & * ! that 's mind - blowingly infuriating			1
and it 's worse for some species and regions , in particular			1
the report overall considers 10,380 populations of 3,038 species of mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians and fish , and says populations have declined by 52 % between 1970 and 2010			1
but for freshwater fish and other species , the drop is 76 %			2
and for for species in the @entity50 , which includes @entity51 and @entity52 , the decline is 83 %			1
@entity53 , director general of @entity21 , writes that , " this has to make us stop and think			1
" he 's correct , of course			2
but we ca n't stop at the thinking			0
we need prompt , dramatic action			2
the report says that we need @entity59 in order to " meet the demands humanity currently makes on nature			2
" that means we need to consume less , waste less , farm more efficiently , use water in a much smarter way and reduce our overall footprint			0
we need to stop chopping down forests and work to repair those that are gone			0
the majority of people now lives in cities ( 54 % , according to the @entity75 ) , which is a fine enough trend , but those cities need to become drastically smarter			2
sprawl must be left in the rear - view mirror of our former suvs			0
all that , and we must take swift action to curb carbon pollution			2
the massive rallies around the recent @entity86 climate summit should make that clear			0
" climate change has already been linked to the population decline and possible extinction of a number of amphibian species in the @entity50 and in @entity92 , " the @entity20 says			2
" in the @entity95 , the effects of a rapidly warming climate have been suggested as likely causes of decline in body condition and numbers in many polar bear and caribou populations			1
" this stuff is depressing , but the report does offer signs of hope			2
it relays a case study from @entity108 , for example , which started estimating the financial value of protecting ecological resources , particularly those along the coast			0
" @entity108 's coastal and ocean ecosystems provide services worth up to $ 559 million per year -- equivalent to 43 % of @entity119 , " the report says			1
facts like that make it clear why there 's a financial as well as moral incentive to protect our remaining natural resources			1
the authors cite wind farms in @entity130 as another success			0
" december 2013 marked a significant milestone , when wind power provided an equivalent of 57.4 % of @entity130 's electricity consumption -- the first time ever that wind power supplied more than half of a country 's electricity needs for a whole month			1
december 21 set another record , with wind turbines generating the equivalent of 102 % of @entity130 electricity consumption , " the authors write			2
i 'm glad those positive notes are included -- because there 's a real risk of reading too much doom and gloom into this report			1
i called up @entity151 , @entity152 professor of conservation ecology at @entity154 , and found he shares that point of view			0
@entity151 is an author of a study , published earlier this year , that found species are disappearing at a rate " 1,000 times faster than they should be , " as he put it			0
but things are n't as bad as the @entity21 report makes it sound , he said			1
" overall , there is no question that the status of biodiversity is going down -- that things are not improving , " he told me			0
" that said , i 'm not a fan of this @entity170			0
the reason is it sort of mixes up apples and oranges and lots of other fruit , too , for that manner			0
it 's a little difficult to unpack exactly what it means			2
there are many people in the media who assumed it means 50 % of species have gone extinct in the last 40 years -- and that 's not true			1
" instead , the report claims 50 % of some vertebrate populations have disappeared			1
but a single species could still exist with a smaller population size			0
assessing individual ecosystems and species is more useful , he said			0
the risk of considering so many species -- and so many types of data -- in a single report , @entity151 said , is that it can make action seem impossible			1
and , for him and others , that 's not the case			2
there 's much to be done			0
we can set aside protected habitats , put firm caps on carbon emissions , break up gangs that trade in illegal wildlife parts and continue to fund scientific exploration to ensure their safety and continued viability			0
@entity151 highlighted a number of conservation success stories , including the fact that @entity217 has reduced deforestation drastically in recent years -- and that the world has made strides in protecting ecosystems			0
the world has set targets to protect 17 % for " terrestrial and inland water " ecosystems , and 10 % for " coastal and marine areas			1
" we should move urgently in that direction			0
the point is that we know which direction to move in			0
it 's bad out there , but it 's sure not hopeless			1
we need to celebrate the species that remain -- from the penguin to the pangolin ( especially the pangolin ) -- and commit to a path of global economic development that embraces the intrinsic and economic value of the natural world			1
this report -- and a host of others -- should n't be a total downer			0
they should be read as a clarion call for action .			0

@entity21 report : vertebrate populations decline by 52 % since 1970
@entity252 writes urgent action is needed to save the natural world
