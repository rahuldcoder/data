@entity0 -- when architect @entity4 looks in the mirror each morning his reflection is not all that greets him -- he can also see the weather report , e-mail messages and his heart rate			0
" the biggest game changer of the past 25 years has been the @entity16 , " said @entity4 , whose @entity9 is an offshoot of his @entity0 architectural firm 's focus on integrating technology in design			2
" in buildings , the @entity16 has become ubiquitous but it has n't caught up in the products that inhabit buildings -- chairs , doors , tables and mirrors			2
" law 's company -- and a raft of new government - funded projects in mainland @entity29 -- is looking to change that			1
@entity4 's $ 5,000 mirror began as product his firm designed for a high - tech residential building in @entity35			0
" @entity36 began to become more real for us as a project , " @entity4 said			0
" we started to take these things out of our building designs to make them independent products , and try to impregnate them with as much technology as we can			0
" if there 's a race to lead the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , @entity29 aims to set the pace			1
since @entity29 premier @entity49 identified @entity16 as an " emerging strategic industry " in an interview on state media , @entity48 has focused on developing technology by which devices can communicate via infrared sensor , @entity56 ( @entity56 ) and other machine - to - machine ( @entity58 ) technology			1
@entity48 plans to invest 5 billion yuan ( $ 800 million ) in the @entity16 industry by 2015			1
the @entity61 estimates @entity29 's @entity16 market will hit 500 billion yuan ( $ 80.3 billion ) by 2015 , then double to 1 trillion yuan ( $ 166 billion ) by 2020			1
the government has established state - owned enterprise zones such as the @entity65 in @entity67 province , which is developing a health care system in which rural villagers can step into a telephone booth - sized " health capsule " to get a diagnosis and prescription from a doctor in a distant hospital			1
" with the capsules and clinics , people do low - cost checkups and choose an online doctor for further diagnosis , then print prescription and purchase medicine from the capsule , " boasts the program 's web site			0
the larger goal of @entity29 's focus in @entity16 , analysts say , is to win a fight @entity48 has long been losing -- setting international standards for new technology			1
after leading losing fights to use @entity29 standards in 3g technology and wireless mobile standards , @entity29 is trying to get out front early on @entity16			1
" in technology @entity29 has come from a position of follower , adopting foreign standards on which it has to pay royalties , " said @entity97 , director of @entity98 , a technology consulting firm in @entity48			1
" @entity29 is very interested in turning that model around , and create the standards by which other countries are paying it royalties , " he said			2
" it 's a new area , and as such , a place where @entity29 can be at the starting line or ahead of the starting line			0
" law sees three other factors at play in @entity29 's @entity16 thrust			1
" @entity29 is in a position to invest more than other economies in the world at this period of time , " @entity4 said			0
" and @entity29 still has a internalized , walled internet because it 's trying to monitor , control and censor -- so it 's in its own interest to develop these kind of products			2
" but i think the third thing is @entity29 has matured to a point where it is no longer a low cost center of labor ... in cutting edge businesses , it wants to really develop its own brand and its own next generation of technology , to walk into the fight with your own swords by investing in the next @entity138 , the next @entity139 , " @entity4 said			0
" from a state perspective , there is everything to gain in nurturing their own brands ... the country wants to define the market rather than play catch - up , " @entity4 added			2
@entity4 's company has sold 500 of the @entity149 and is now developing a chair that recognizes the user and records individual health data			0
" i really feel that the next paradigm for product design will be changed by the @entity16 and the new range of materials we now have , " he said			0
" we should n't be building things in the same way as the past			0

the internet of things market in @entity29 is expected to hit $ 80.3 billion in 2015
@entity48 has *earmarked* $ 800 million for @entity16 investment by 2015
@entity29 has created state - funded zones like @entity65
@entity48 aims to become a global leader in setting @entity16 global standards
