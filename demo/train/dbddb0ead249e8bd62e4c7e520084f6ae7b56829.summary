in july , @entity0 lost one of its most acclaimed playwrights and directors when @entity4 passed away in @entity5 at the age of 62			1
scores of relatives , friends , and theater lovers attended his funeral ceremony that was adorned with pictures of @entity4 -- his trademark mustache and playful smile on display			0
some wept while embracing copies of his famous screenplays			0
among the mourners was @entity4 's daughter , @entity20 , who is convinced that @entity22 sanctions against @entity0 were partly to blame for his father 's passing			1
" this was the doctor 's testimony , " said @entity25			2
" this is based on my father 's medical tests			2
" through five decades , some of the most famous @entity0 plays were brought to life by @entity4			1
all were stories about the loves and losses of everyday @entity0			1
then in 2011 , came a diagnosis of late - stage liver cancer			2
@entity43 was not an option , but @entity4 's oncologist prescribed the cancer drug nexavar			2
according to his doctor and medical tests , the drug appeared to stop the cancer from spreading			0
" we were very hopeful that if he gets through this stage , he could get healthy and start living his life again , " said his daughter @entity20			2
but beginning last year -- soon after @entity56 and western powers imposed additional sanctions against @entity0 to rein in its nuclear program -- @entity0 doctors , pharmacists and patients say finding nexavar and several other drugs that treated deadly diseases became increasingly difficult			1
western powers have stepped up the pressure on @entity0 since 2006 , when the @entity68 voted unanimously to impose new sanctions for @entity5 's failure to suspend its nuclear program			1
the @entity71 imposed further sanctions last year			1
@entity74 officials have long said medical goods are exempt from the measures and that @entity22 sanctions are specifically designed to target the government , not ordinary @entity0			1
but @entity0 officials say with the @entity22 ban on @entity0 banks doing business with much of the outside world , even medical goods that are exempt from the sanctions are often impossible to import			1
" we have a serious shortage of drugs due to high prices or because they 're impossible to purchase , " says @entity5 - based pharmacist @entity86			1
@entity86 said everyday he gets as many as 30 calls a day from patients looking for hard - to - find drugs			1
" they 're obviously tired because they 've been searching for a while			0
" @entity20 was getting tired too			0
this year , finding @entity98 -- the drug that helped keep her father alive -- became harder than ever			0
" it was very unexpected , " said @entity20			0
" for 18 months we could easily get the drug but now we could n't			0
we did n't know what to do			0
" searching for the drug became @entity108 's daily mission			0
if pharmacies in @entity5 did n't have @entity98 , @entity108 would open her phone book and start dialing pharmacies in other @entity0 cities like @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
but last march finding @entity98 became virtually impossible , she says			0
medical tests then showed her father 's feto - protein level -- an indicator of cancer -- skyrocketed over the four months he went without @entity98			2
on july 25 , @entity4 lost his fight with cancer			0
@entity0 lost a beloved playwright			2
and a daughter lost a father who she believes was a victim of @entity22 sanctions and a political conflict that had nothing to do with him			1
" more than being angry , i think about how simple - minded politicians are , " she said			0
" sanctions are impacting the people , not the groups politicians say they 're impacting			0

@entity0 say access to life - saving drugs is difficult because of @entity22 sanctions
@entity139 has imposed harsh **economic** sanctions for @entity0 's failure to suspend nuclear program
**economic** sanctions targeting @entity0 banks and *energy* *sector* have crippled @entity0 's *economy*
@entity74 officials say @entity22 sanctions are designed to target government , not citizens
