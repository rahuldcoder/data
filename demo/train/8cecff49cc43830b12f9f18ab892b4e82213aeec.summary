@entity1 gov. @entity0 said gov. @entity3 's veto of a ban that would have prohibited the use of pig gestation crates in @entity7 was a " good decision			1
" according to the @entity9 , @entity0 said in his weekly press conference monday that he personally lobbied for @entity3 to not sign the measure , arguing that people in @entity7 do n't understand the issue			1
while animal rights activists and supporters of the ban say the crates are cruel -- pregnant sows ca n't turn around in the limited space -- advocates like @entity0 argue the crates help keep sows separated from smaller piglets that are at risk of being stepped on and killed			0
" this is an issue that most people in @entity7 have no clue , " @entity0 said			2
" they do n't raise hardly any pigs in @entity7 , they do n't have farrowing crates			0
but this is something we do have knowledge of in @entity1 , and i give him credit for listening to and understanding that this is something we 're very concerned about and that does impact consumers as well because if these baby pigs are crushed and die that means there are fewer pigs and that impacts the price of pork			0
" by comparison , @entity7 has far fewer pigs ( 9,000 ) compared to @entity1 , the county 's largest pork producer with 20.5 million , according to the @entity52			1
@entity1 is also a state that holds enormous influence in the 2016 presidential election given its status as the first - in - the - nation nominating state -- thus a politically important state for @entity3 should he decide to make a @entity60 bid			1
" i did share with gov. @entity3 my personal experience and my interest in this and that of @entity66 and the @entity67 , all of which are headquartered here in @entity1 , " @entity0 said			1
@entity3 said he vetoed the bill because it was a " solution in search of a problem " and a " political movement masquerading as substantive policy			0
" such decisions , he argued , should be made by the state 's @entity77 , which currently does n't outlaw the crates			0
in his comments monday , @entity0 appeared to be conflating gestation crates with farrowing gates , which keep pigs separated from piglets after giving birth but still allows access for nursing			1
it 's an argument that 's been pushed by other opponents of gestation bans			0
" it 's stunning that the governor of @entity1 is so unfamiliar with pig farming that he does n't know the difference between gestation crates and farrowing crates , " said @entity91 , vice president of @entity92 at the @entity93			1
" this bill applied only to gestation crates , meaning there are no piglets to be kept separate from their mothers , since they 're all in utero , " he told @entity100			2
the @entity106 , which helped push the @entity7 bill and advocates for group housing for sows , argue that pig farmers use the crates simply to cram as many pigs into one facility as possible			2
@entity115 , spokesman for the @entity116 , acknowledged that farrowing crates -- not gestation crates -- are used to prevent sows from stepping on piglets , and said someone who makes comments like @entity0 's are " just mixing them up			1
" he said group housing can result in aggression between pigs , and gestation crates help protect adult pigs from each other			2
he added it 's true that the crates help provide space for slightly more pigs in a facility but argued " there 's nothing inhumane about them			0
" because of the crates , he said , farmers and veterinarians have better access to provide daily monitoring and care for the pigs , making them healthier .			0
