@entity0 -- nine technicians responsible for monitoring operations at a @entity6 nuclear power plant spent on - duty time surfing the @entity7 -- visiting websites that included news , sports , fishing and retirement information -- jeopardizing the safety of the plant , federal regulators say			1
the @entity15 disclosed the web - surfing activities monday in a letter that proposes a $ 140,000 fine against the @entity20 nuclear power station , 24 miles northwest of @entity21			1
no pornography sites were accessed , the @entity15 said			0
and importantly , the @entity15 said , the computer use did not present an avenue for hackers to gain access to reactor control systems , a modern - day fear at industrial plants			2
but the @entity15 said the web - surfing control room operators were directly responsible for monitoring the reactor and other plant systems , and that their actions violated plant procedures requiring operators to remain attentive and focused on their work			1
according to an @entity15 investigation , nine operators " deliberately violated " the safety procedures by surfing the web between january and april of 2010			2
three of the nine did so with such frequency and duration that they are being issued " severity level three enforcement violations			0
" ( severity level one represents the greatest significant violation and severity level four is the lowest			0
) the remaining six operators will receive severity level four violations			0
the operators were not named by the @entity15			0
an @entity15 spokesman said the proposed fine for web surfing is the only such action for web surfing in memory , and may be the only such action in the history of the agency			2
in a notice to @entity66 , operators of the @entity64 , the @entity15 said that it appears that operators " remained attentive to reactor operations , indications , and alarms " while surfing the @entity7			1
" however , because most of the operators involved knew and understood " the prohibitions on internet access , they exhibited " deliberate misconduct " and engaged in " hundreds of instances " of accessing the internet from the " at - the - controls " area of the control room			0
" this violation is a serious concern to the @entity15 not only because accessing the @entity7 ... has the potential to distract the licensed operator , " the @entity15 said , but also because of the " large number of licensed reactor operators " who deliberately chose to ignore the ban			1
the @entity15 chastised the plant , saying that while @entity64 " had strong evidence that a safety culture problem existed , " comprehensive actions were not taken for " at least a year			0
" @entity15 regional administrator @entity91 said in the letter that @entity20 's " particularly poor performance " in responding to the problem merited doubling the base fine of $ 70,000 to $ 140,000			1
if @entity66 disagrees with the enforcement action and proposed fine , the company can request a neutral mediator to explore a resolution , according to the @entity15			2
@entity66 did not immediately respond to a call			1
