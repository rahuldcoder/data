-- the @entity3 's big , bold stroke encouraging all states to prohibit drivers from using cell phones faces a long , tortuous process in the nation 's statehouses , experts said wednesday			1
this political reality stands out : since states began legislating distracted driving or cell phone use in 2000 , none has gone so far as to impose a complete ban on mobile devices behind the wheel , and only one state -- @entity19 -- has considered such a blanket prohibition , just this year , said @entity21 , senior policy specialist with @entity22			1
@entity23 , executive director of the @entity24 , said opponents do n't like big government intrusions and savor their personal freedoms			0
" this is a controversial issue so you can assume it 's not going to pass right away , " @entity23 said			0
" it 's going to take a long time for legislatures to pass laws , and a long time for states to begin to enforce the laws , and then a long time for behavior to start to change			2
" the first seat - belt law was passed in the mid- ' 80s , and we 're now at 84 percent of drivers who are buckled up nationwide , " even though all states now have laws requiring drivers and passengers to wear seat belts , @entity23 said			1
" people like to be connected			0
they like to respond to e-mails and voice mail , " @entity23 said			0
states wo n't embrace such a blanket ban recommended by the @entity3 , said @entity50 , executive director and ceo of @entity52			1
lawmakers believe that constituents and trade groups alike view such a total ban as excessive , he said			1
" it 's just one of those things that would be the equivalent of the @entity61 today			0
it 's a prohibition that would not work , " @entity62 said			2
" i do n't believe most state lawmakers would say ( the @entity3 recommendation ) is viable , " @entity62 said			2
" to check to see what 's for dinner and who 's going to pick up the kids , those are so ingrained as conveniences in our daily lives , to say that we 're not going to allow you to connect , that seems so unrealistic			0
" still , @entity62 praised the @entity3 initiative as " boldly aspirational			2
" " if it gets people 's attention , it will do good , " he said			0
" i just hope they pursue their campaign through cooperation and collaboration rather than preemption or mandates on the states , in other words forcing it down the states ' throats			0
" @entity3 chairwoman @entity92 acknowledged that the recommended ban is " a challenge " that " will take some time			1
" another @entity3 board member said the proposal 's target -- distracted driving -- is " the new dui			2
" " i know how difficult this is because i used to talk on my phone , as well , until i understood the dangers of it , " @entity92 told @entity0 on wednesday			0
" and i 'll tell you , when i hung up my phone and stopped talking on the phone while i was driving , it was like becoming sober and seeing that everyone around you was drinking			0
you notice the people who are distracted			0
" in the past 10 years the @entity3 has increasingly sought to limit the use of portable electronic devices -- recommending bans for novice drivers , school bus drivers and commercial truckers			1
tuesday 's recommendation , if adopted by states , would outlaw nonemergency phone calls and texting by operators of every vehicle on the road			0
the initiative would apply to hands - free as well as hand - held devices , but devices installed in the vehicle by the manufacturer would be allowed , the @entity3 said			1
the recommendation would not affect passengers ' rights to use such devices the @entity24 , which represents state highway safety agencies in all 50 states , the @entity130 and @entity131 , has n't taken a position on the @entity3 recommendation because the association would like to see more research			1
" there 's conflicting evidence " on whether hands - free cell phone conversations would be as unsafe as those by hand - helds , @entity23 said , adding that more " definitive research " is needed			2
" if it shows both are unsafe , then a total ban may make the most sense , " she said			1
so far , nine states and the @entity130 prohibit hand - held cell phones while driving , @entity21 said			1
a 10th state , @entity151 , has deemed speaking on a hand - held phone as a careless driving offense if it is accompanied by another moving violation , @entity23 said			0
thirty states and the @entity130 prohibit novice drivers and teenagers from using cell phones while driving , but no state has imposed such a ban on all drivers , @entity21 said			1
one cell phone industry group supports states ' ban on texting while driving -- a law enacted in 35 states and the @entity130 , according to the @entity167			1
but the @entity168 did n't take a position on the @entity3 's recommended ban on cell phone conversations behind the wheel			1
" manual texting while driving is clearly incompatible with safety , which is why we have historically supported a ban on texting while driving			0
as far as talking on wireless devices while driving , we defer to state and local lawmakers and their constituents as to what they believe are the most appropriate laws where they live , " @entity177 , president and ceo of the industry group , said in a statement			0
in @entity19 , state rep. @entity191 , a @entity192 , this year proposed legislation that would ban using a cell phone when driving , but the measure died , he said			1
" i 'm very happy to see that the @entity3 has taken notice of what is clearly a problem that basically anyone who is on the road can recognize themselves			2
it 's important that a national organization is getting involved			0
otherwise , it 's a state - by - state slog , and that slog has n't been going so well , including in @entity19 , " @entity191 said			2
the federal government last month banned interstate truck and bus drivers from using cell phones while driving			1
a violation carries a federal fine of $ 2,750 .			0

@entity3 has encouraged all states to prohibit drivers from using cell phones
states will be *reluctant* to impose a total ban on cell phones behind the wheel , experts say
experts : seat - belt laws met with *resistance* , and cell phones ' convenience is " ingrained "
only in @entity19 has a blanket prohibition been considered , and it went nowhere
