a pharmacy tech who makes $ 12 an hour but drives a @entity2			0
a rumor that a pharmacist may be trading sex for drugs			0
a prescription note with handwriting that 's a little too easy to read			2
the @entity9 in @entity10 says all of these scenarios should leave pharmacy workers suspicious of illegal activity at their store			1
and they hope pharmacy employees -- or anyone , for that matter -- will report such activity to its new prescription drug abuse tip line			1
the agency launched an initiative , @entity24 , this week to allow the public to quickly and anonymously report suspicious activity			0
tipsters can text @entity28 , or 847 - 411 , and then use the keyword @entity29			0
the message will be forwarded to a @entity9 agent who will investigate			1
@entity33 is one of the first states in the country to try the texting effort			1
the city of @entity39 is also experimenting with the program			0
agents hope it will become a successful weapon to fight the war on prescription drug abuse , a war they feel they are losing			1
" it really is out of control here , " said @entity48 , director of the @entity49 and @entity50			0
prescription drug abuse is a national epidemic , according to the @entity54			1
overdose rates in the @entity56 have more than tripled since 1990 , and prescription drugs are to blame for a number of those deaths			2
the rise in overdoses parallels a 300 % increase in the sale of strong opioid painkillers since 1999			0
in 2008 , prescription pain pills actually killed more people than all those who died from taking cocaine or heroin			1
the pain pills , unlike cocaine or heroin , are often bought legally -- at least at first			2
very few come from someone robbing a pharmacy			0
most abusers get the pills from a friend or family member who had the initial prescription			2
only 2.3 % say they bought them from a drug dealer or stranger , according to the @entity84 on @entity85 and @entity86 , which used 2010 data			0
" the illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse , " said @entity88 , special agent in charge of the @entity9 's @entity10 division			1
the issue can become an even bigger problem when the friend or family member runs out of the pills , according to @entity88			0
then , often , people will either forge prescriptions from doctors or -- if they ca n't get access to legal drugs -- turn to another opioid like heroin , which is sometimes even easier to get			2
with the announcement of the tip line , the @entity9 said it is sending education materials to 1,200 pharmacies in the @entity10 metropolitan area			1
the packet includes tip line information and a guide that points out suspicious signs to monitor			1
the guide , a pamphlet , suggests that people get these drugs illegally by stealing doctors ' prescription pads or altering a legitimate prescription with a different callback number that can ring to an accomplice that would verify the prescription			2
other tricks include people calling the pharmacy masquerading as doctors			0
the pamphlet warns pharmacists to watch for customers who come back a little too regularly or people who come in with a prescription for a stimulant and a depressant at the same time			2
often , abusers will seek both " uppers " and " downers " when they are addicted to prescription painkillers			0
a prescription with all the words spelled out or with perfect handwriting is also suspicious , according to the @entity9			1
most doctors are in such a hurry , they will use abbreviations , and doctors are not typically known for neat handwriting			0
the @entity54 suggests that pharmacists talk with patients about safely using , storing and disposing of prescription painkillers			0
it also recommends that health professionals consult their state 's prescription drug monitoring programs			1
@entity88 said he does n't think his agency will get a ton of tips through the new tip line , but he believes the tips it does get will yield good results .			1

@entity9 creates a tip line to fight prescription drug abuse
painkiller abuse killed more people in 2008 than cocaine and heroin *combined*
@entity33 @entity9 hopes the tip line will be a model for the rest of the country
