@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the eve of a two - day summit with @entity7 president @entity6 , @entity1 president @entity3 says both countries are " moderately optimistic " about " resetting " their relations			1
@entity1 president @entity3 spoke to @entity11 media about conflicting views on @entity7 missile defense			1
in an interview with @entity11 media @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity3 said relations " have begun to revive " after a period of significant deterioration during the administration of president @entity21			2
the top issue on the agenda for the two leaders , @entity3 said , is working out a new treaty on limiting strategic offensive nuclear weapons to replace the 1991 @entity28 agreement , which expires december 5			1
the @entity1 leader stakes out the position @entity1 has held for some time : that the issue of reducing those weapons is linked to the issue of a missile defense system , and he repeated his opposition to the missile defense shield the @entity7 has proposed to be installed in @entity38 and the @entity39			1
the @entity21 administration raised the idea ; the @entity6 administration is reviewing the plan and has not decided whether to proceed			1
but , significantly , @entity3 said he thinks " we are fully able to find a reasonable solution " to the standoff			0
" in order to resolve this issue , we do not necessarily have to cancel out all the previous decisions that have been made , " he said			0
" it is enough to show restraint , to show an ability to compromise			0
and then we can agree on the basic foundations of a new start treaty and agree at the same time on how we will approach missile defense			2
" the president 's remarks are the clearest expression yet of @entity1 's position on linkage , and they appear to indicate that @entity1 will not torpedo ongoing negotiations to replace the @entity28 treaty just because @entity0 opposes the @entity7 missile defense proposal			1
" the @entity1 is not against the development of such a means of defense , " @entity3 said , " but we believe that it should not be unilateral nor , in essence , directed against one of the participants in this dialogue , a major nuclear country such as @entity1			2
we believe that the decisions that were taken on this topic have put us in a difficult position			0
" a missile defense system , he said , " must refer to global action to protect ourselves from countries which actually pose a threat today			2
and we are ready for such a dialogue with the @entity7			0
" @entity7 officials insist that the @entity6 administration wants to work with @entity1 on missile defense as part of a network of interconnected systems that might include sites in @entity1			1
but final proposals on this are on the back burner as the administration carries out a major review of its defense policy in a " nuclear posture review , " scheduled to be completed by this fall			0
the @entity1 president , however , rejects the @entity7 explanation that the missile defense system is aimed at threats from @entity99			1
" they are too far apart geographically			0
i do not understand how people can say that missile defense is linked to the problems of the @entity106 , " he told the @entity11 media			0
" therefore , it seems to me that all these arguments have been developed simply to justify the decisions taken by the previous administration of the @entity7			0

relations have " begun to revive " after @entity21 administration , he says
treaty on strategic nuclear weapons tops his agenda for @entity6 summit
he says @entity1 " is not against the development " of @entity7 missile defense plan
