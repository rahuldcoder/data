@entity0 -- the makers of @entity3 , the glass that 's used in touchscreen gadgets such as @entity6 , @entity7 and more than 500 other models of electronic gadgets , has officially unveiled a thinner and more touch - sensitive version of their product			1
when it comes to innovation in electronic gadgets , a new kind of glass is not especially sexy			2
but when that glass is built into millions of touchscreen devices , and could potentially make them thinner , lighter and more responsive to your finger , consumers may take notice			1
@entity23 says @entity3 is thinner and more touch - sensitive without sacrificing toughness or resistance to scratches			1
the company showed off the glass monday at a gadget - showcase event at the @entity30 here and is showing live demos of its enhanced qualities at the @entity23 booth throughout the four - day show			1
the new glass is not any less resistant to breakage than the current @entity3 , which may be disappointing news to anyone who has had to put up with a cracked screen after dropping a phone			1
" it 's not scratch - proof			0
and if they drop it on granite , it can be broken , " said @entity23 general manager @entity43			2
but he added that @entity23 has managed to make the glass 20 % thinner but just as strong -- a key advancement at a time when smartphone and tablet makers are trying to produce ever - thinner devices			1
the second generation of @entity3 will debut in @entity57 - based pcs this year			0
other manufacturers also are weighing how and when to add the glass to their upcoming devices , @entity58 said			0
because it 's thinner -- about 0.8 millimeters instead of 1 millimeter -- the glass allows users ' fingers to be closer to the touch interface , creating a screen that responds more quickly and accurately , said @entity3 program director @entity68			1
the glass also has been engineered to let more light through , creating a brighter display screen , @entity23 executives said			2
due to customer nondisclosure agreements , @entity23 can not name all the devices that use @entity3 -- including @entity76 products			1
but according to multiple other sources , including @entity81 's recent biography of @entity76 co-founder @entity82 , the product 's first consumer application was the original @entity6 in 2007			0
a passage from @entity81 's book details how @entity76 had originally planned to use plastic display coverings for its @entity6 before @entity82 approached @entity23 ceo @entity86 about ordering glass instead			2
weeks told him @entity23 had developed a tough form of glass , made extra strong by a chemical process , but could n't find a market for it			1
weeks did n't think @entity23 could manufacture the glass fast enough to meet @entity76 's timetable for the @entity6 launch			2
but at the prodding of @entity82 , who would n't take no for an answer , @entity23 did it in six months			0
after the @entity6 hit the market , @entity82 sent weeks a note that said , " we could n't have done it without you			0
" @entity3 also is part of touchscreens in electronic devices by @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , among other manufacturers			0
@entity68 demonstrated its toughness monday by placing a small square of the original glass in a lever press , then applying more than 100 pounds of pressure onto it			0
despite looking like he was truly exerting himself , he could n't break it			0
@entity68 then tested the new glass the same way and got the same result .			0
