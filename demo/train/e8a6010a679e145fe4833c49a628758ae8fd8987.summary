-- the message will have been heard loud and clear across @entity2			0
@entity3 , themselves on the end of a thrashing in the @entity8 semifinals last year , dished out one of its own on tuesday			1
the @entity11 champions , led by former @entity13 coach @entity12 , raced into a five - goal lead over @entity16 side as @entity17 in their group stages clash , with just 36 minutes on the clock			1
it was a devastating display of attacking football that left the thousands of fervent fans gathered in @entity25 's @entity24 shell shocked			0
except , of course , for those 5,000 supporters who had made the trip from @entity28			0
@entity12 is aiming for a hat - trick of @entity8 triumphs after securing two during his four - year spell at the @entity35 giants			2
and if it carries on like this , @entity3 will prove a tough nut to crack in the competition 's latter stages			2
the rout began on eight minutes , @entity43 international @entity42 cutting inside former @entity45 defender @entity44 to bend a shot into the far corner			2
@entity48 , whose winning goal sealed a @entity51 triumph for @entity28 in @entity52 , made it two after swapping passes with international teammate @entity54			2
@entity57 striker @entity56 made it 3 - 0 with a fine header from @entity61 's cross before @entity42 grabbed another , similar to his opener			1
when @entity64 was adjudged to have handled inside his own area , @entity54 stroked home the penalty to make it 5 - 0 in front of a stunned stadium			1
things did improve for @entity17 in the second half as @entity74 midfielder @entity73 got them on the scoresheet with a close range header , but it was only a brief respite			2
substitute @entity80 made it six , clipping the ball into the net after a precise through ball from @entity42 , before another sub -- @entity86 -- made it seven from close range			0
it brought back painful memories for @entity17 of another seven - goal mauling , when it lost by the same scoreline to @entity94 side @entity93 back in 2007			1
@entity3 's third win from three outings saw it take firm control of @entity99 , with @entity17 second on four points			1
@entity17 boss @entity102 said : " we collapsed tactically and in terms of our aggressiveness			2
we let them play and they 're too good for that			0
i was the first to make mistakes ; it 's not the players ' fault			0
" incredibly , @entity3 's 45 minute heroics were bettered by @entity116 side @entity115 , who raced into a 6 - 0 lead over @entity119 in @entity120 at halftime to set a new @entity8 record			1
@entity115 went on to win 7 - 0 , @entity52 striker @entity123 becoming only the second player to score five goals in a @entity8 game , after @entity13 's @entity127			1
those 15 goals across two matches helped bump tuesday 's tally to 40 across the eight games , a new record for the continent 's most lucrative club competition			1
news of @entity3 's triumph will have provided succor for @entity138 , who were stunned by a late @entity141 equalizer in @entity99 's other encounter , in @entity143			2
for the second time in a month its 18,600 capacity @entity145 was closed to fans after sanctions from @entity2 soccer 's governing body relating to incidents of racism			0
a controversial late penalty from @entity153 canceled out goals from @entity155 and @entity156 meaning the star - studded @entity158 holders now face an uphill task to qualify from its group			2
the match was played out in sub zero temperatures and in front of just a handful of spectators after @entity166 decreed @entity141 's stadium must be closed to fans for its next three @entity2 games			0
@entity166 charged the club with racism for the third time in a year after troubled flared among its fans during @entity141 's defeat to @entity17 in september			2
the first came almost a year ago , when @entity138 's @entity74 midfielder @entity175 was subject to racist chanting from the stands			0
@entity175 reacted furiously saying at some point @entity166 had to ban a club " for a couple of years			0
" @entity141 hit back , saying the incident had been " very exaggerated			0
" there were no such flashpoints on tuesday , given only a clutch of people were present to witness another poor @entity2 performance from @entity138			0
it had eased into a two - goal lead inside 38 first half minutes as it looked to register a first win in this season 's competition			1
a ball over the top from @entity192 put @entity193 in on goal and he unselfishly squared for @entity195 striker @entity155 to tap into an empty net			0
less than 10 minutes later , @entity155 's shot from inside the box fell perfectly for @entity199 international @entity156 to slide in and convert			0
but as the match wore on @entity138 retreated , and after @entity74 international @entity201 had polished off a @entity203 cross , he enticed @entity204 into a clumsy tackle , allowing @entity206 to tuck home the penalty			0
when asked how @entity138 had let its lead slip , manager @entity209 told @entity211 : " because football is 95 minutes , we have scored two goals and had clear chances to score more but we did n't			1
" i do n't want to talk about the referee			0
we have nine more points to play and i am confident we will qualify			0
" elsewhere , @entity127 moved within two goals of @entity220 's all - time @entity8 scoring record with @entity13 's second goal in its 3 - 1 win over @entity43 side @entity223			1
@entity224 scored the opening goal before the @entity226 struck his 69th @entity8 goal , @entity229 ­ rez adding a late third			1
@entity158 leaders @entity45 thrashed @entity232 of @entity233 6 - 0 at @entity234 , @entity235 scoring his first goal for the club since rejoining prior to the start of the season			1
an 87th minute strike from @entity243 forward @entity242 helped @entity245 champions @entity244 to a 1 - 0 victory over @entity247 in @entity248			1
a goal in the dying seconds from @entity250 sealed a 4 - 3 success for @entity11 club @entity252 in a epic encounter with @entity255 side @entity254			1
but there was better news for @entity258 as @entity259 registered a 2 - 1 victory over @entity35 outfit @entity261 , courtesy of @entity264 's winner			1
football : @entity267 's 100m friends			0

@entity3 beats as @entity17 7 - 1 in the @entity8
the @entity11 champions raced into a five goal lead after just 36 minutes
@entity115 go 6 - 0 up before the interval against @entity119 in @entity120
a total of 40 goals scored across eight matches setting a new record
