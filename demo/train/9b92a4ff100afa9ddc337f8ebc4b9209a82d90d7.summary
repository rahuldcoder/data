the grower was alarmed when the police helicopter swooped low over his property			1
soon , @entity5 , @entity6 , deputies -- " strapped to the gills " and with a drug dog in tow -- converged on his doorstep			1
they had the grower dead to rights			0
except the plant that the chopper cops had spotted from the air was ... okra			2
@entity18 of @entity19 told @entity21 affiliate @entity20 that he is none too happy about last week 's " raid " conducted by the governor 's drug suppression task force			1
" here i am , at home and retired and you know i do the right thing , " @entity18 told the station			0
" then they come to my house strapped with weapons for no reason			2
" he received many calls about all of the police officers at his home , @entity18 said , and he worries that his reputation in the community may suffer			2
the helicopter was combing the area in search of cannabis plants when it came across the five - leaflet okra plant , the station reported			1
marijuana plants can have anywhere between one and 13 leaflets per leaf , depending on maturity and health , but they generally have seven or nine			0
" it did have quite a number of characteristics that were similar to a cannabis plant , " @entity54 capt. @entity53 told @entity20			1
upon realizing that it had dispatched officers to confiscate a popular gumbo ingredient , the @entity54 , which operates the task force , issued an apology , both to @entity18 and publicly			1
" if we disturbed them in any manner , that 's not our intent			0
our intent is to go out and do our job and do it to the best of our ability , " @entity53 told @entity20			0
