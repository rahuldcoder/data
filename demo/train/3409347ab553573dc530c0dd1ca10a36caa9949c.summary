-- @entity4 tribesman who reportedly fought for @entity5 in @entity6 have returned to @entity2 with weapons , stoking violence and forcing thousands to flee , @entity2 's president said			1
the development , announced by president @entity11 in a speech broadcast on state tv over the weekend , is perhaps the most - significant regional fallout to date from the end of former @entity6 leader 's regime			1
the fighters returning from @entity6 have blended into the @entity19 of the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) and renamed northern @entity2 as the @entity20 , the name of the region home to a majority of the @entity4			1
during the address , @entity11 blamed freshly - armed fighters returning from @entity6 for attacks on military patrols outside the northeastern town of @entity31 , which has become a flashpoint in the struggle between the military and the rebels			1
the military was " unable to enter @entity31 where elements of @entity39 in @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , a group of former fighters from @entity6 and a group of deserters from our army were well positioned , " @entity11 said , according to the state - run @entity50 newspaper			1
" the fighting was hard and we lost men , and equipment was destroyed			0
" the growing insurgency is also raising concerns in @entity58 , which sees the small , poor nation as an important ally against @entity41 , the @entity61 group			0
" the situation is unpredictable and instability could spread			2
private citizens have not been targeted , but the @entity21 has indicated via its websites that it intends to conduct military operations across northern @entity2 , " the @entity64 said as part of a new travel warning issued last week			1
@entity64 spokeswoman @entity70 condemned the rebel attacks , saying saturday that " the @entity72 is deeply concerned by continuing incidents of violence			0
" the influx of fighters returning from @entity6 has re-energized the @entity4 insurgency , which seeks to wrest control of three northern regions , according to the global intelligence firm @entity80			1
" @entity2 has experienced perhaps the most significant external repercussions from the downfall of the regime of @entity6 leader @entity5 , " it said in a recent analysis			1
@entity5 endeared himself to @entity2 by funding the construction of a popular mosque in the capital @entity89 , and helped pay for a @entity2 government complex that remains under construction			1
he is also accused of backing the @entity92 in @entity2 and @entity93 during the 1990s			1
so it came as no surprise that @entity2 @entity92 willingly went to @entity6 to fight for @entity5 as he fought to keep hold of the reigns of his regime which crumbled in august , @entity6 's new government has said			1
after @entity5 's death in october , heavily armed @entity4 fighters began returning home and launching attacks on the @entity2 army , @entity2 's government said			1
the nomadic @entity92 , who are considered an indigenous tribe in the region , are spread across @entity2 , @entity6 , @entity109 , @entity93 and @entity110			1
in @entity2 , the @entity92 have long called for the creation of an independent state -- and have risen up against the @entity2 government a number of times since the 1960s			1
the latest uprising began to take root late last year but gained momentum in january when the rebels began attacking towns in northern @entity2			2
the @entity2 army clashed with rebels in the @entity122 last week , killing 20 people , taking a dozen prisoners and seizing vehicles and weapons , according to the country 's defense ministry			2
it reported no casualties on the government side			0
but the rebels claim to have either attacked or seized at least six towns in recent weeks , including some in the @entity122 , according to its website			0
the claims appear to be supported by reports by the @entity138 that thousands have fled the region ahead of fighting			0
@entity2 have taken to the streets in the capital city of @entity89 to protest the government response to the @entity21 amid rumors that the army , not the rebels , initiated the latest fighting with attacks on the @entity4 , an allegation toure and others say is false			2
the unrest has thrown @entity11 's administration into turmoil			0
he sacked his defense and interior ministers last week , and quickly moved to meet with the wives of soldiers who were forced to flee their homes for refugee camps ahead of rebel attacks			0
@entity11 told the families at camps outside @entity89 and neighboring @entity164 that @entity2 troops did not initiate the fighting in famine - stricken @entity167 , which became ground zero in the latest uprising			2
" our military did not go to the north to make war but rather to deliver supplies to our troops in @entity167 , " he told the wives , according to state - run media			0
it was after that that armed fighters attacked the towns of @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity31 , he told the spouses , according to the report			0
" there are many rumors			0
if we are not careful , we 'll fall into the hands of those who are attacking @entity2 and who want to oppose the government , " he said			2
nearly 10,000 @entity2 and @entity191 have fled because of the fighting , the @entity138 reported last week			2
" some of the refugees have been cared for by ( local ) villagers , but space has been absorbed very quickly , " said @entity193 who heads @entity138 operations in @entity93 and @entity2			2
" the shelters are sketchy			0
these people , many of them women and children , suffer from lack of food and especially water			0
" another 3,000 have reportedly fled to @entity204 , according to the state - run @entity206 news agency			0
@entity0 's @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and journalist @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
