@entity0 , @entity1 -- to most people these days , an " app " is something you download on your smartphone to help you do a specific task -- say , find a good nearby restaurant			0
but big tech companies , seeing how applications have boosted the appeal of gadgets such as @entity15 's @entity14 , are starting to view apps as low - cost enhancements for a broader range of products , from netbooks to tvs and beyond			1
at the @entity23 here this week , microchip maker @entity22 launched an app store geared towards netbook computers			1
not to be outdone , @entity26 announced it will open its own app store for hdtvs , blu - ray players and mobile phones			1
even unlikely players such as @entity32 are getting in on the app act			1
@entity32 announced thursday that several applications , including one that will read aloud @entity37 tweets while you 're driving , will be available on many of its vehicles later this year			1
what 's driving this sudden app movement ? " mobile computer chips have gotten so powerful and affordable , and it 's so easy to get on the @entity49 , that it does n't make much sense to ship a gadget with dedicated , stagnant functionality , " said @entity44 , who covers technology for @entity46			2
" add an internet connection and a software platform open for third - party programmers to develop for -- i.e. , open an app store -- and you can enhance the capabilities of a gadget , thus future - proofing it , at no cost			1
" sales of the apps , which typically cost a few dollars apiece , also create a new source of revenue for the device 's manufacturer , @entity44 said			0
and consumers win , too : they get more value out of their product without having to keep buying new hardware			0
software applications have been around for decades , but it took the recent success of the @entity14 and @entity15 's @entity75 -- with their can - do slogan , " there 's an app for that " -- to make apps sexy on the consumer level			1
developers have created more than 100,000 apps for the store -- at no cost to @entity15 , which takes a cut of revenues			2
less than 18 months after the store launched in 2008 , owners of the @entity14 and @entity89 have downloaded more than 3 billion applications			1
rival smartphone makers such as @entity93 and @entity94 soon followed with app stores of their own			1
it 's now standard for web properties such as @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 to have mobile apps that let users share updates or make purchases on the go			2
the number of people who use @entity49 - enabled mobile devices is expected to pass 1 billion by 2013 , according to industry analysts , meaning that demand for apps will only grow			0
and as more people grow accustomed to using apps to quickly check the weather or send a tweet on @entity37 , more manufacturers will develop apps - ready products , experts say			0
on thursday @entity22 launched a beta version of its app store , called the @entity123 center , for netbooks , the smaller , simpler cousins of laptops			1
about 100 apps , in such categories as entertainment , games , health , social networking , are now available for download at @entity134			0
the beta store will host apps for both @entity137 and the open - source @entity139 operating system , which target the popular netbook computer category powered by @entity22 's atom processor			1
" apps have been defined in people 's minds as these little things that run on the @entity14			0
our focus is on getting lots of smart people to think of the netbook as a device they can target [ for developing apps ] , " said @entity147 , who run 's @entity22 's @entity149 software program			2
eventually , @entity22 and its partners expect to expand the store to include applications for smartphones , tvs and even consumer electronic appliances			1
meanwhile , @entity26 is betting that as television merges with the @entity49 , more channel - surfers will enjoy being able to order a movie from @entity167 or scroll through photos on @entity169 without having to leave their couch			2
@entity26 is calling @entity172 " the world 's first hdtv - based application store , " although it 's not expected to launch until later this year			1
@entity26 has opened the store to third - party developers and hopes to have more than 150 apps available for download by the end of 2010			1
many content partners have already signed up			0
" there 's going to be an application for everything , " said @entity26 product training manager @entity181 , who envisions guys sitting around a living room , playing texas hold ' em poker on a big - screen tv while holding their virtual cards on their smartphones			0
suddenly , a tv becomes more than a tv -- it 's also a computer screen and a gaming console			0
" the idea is to make everyone 's life more convenient without them having to go to more than one place to do it , " @entity181 said			0
" down the road , the app store will bring a lot of different @entity26 products together			1
" soon , apps will even be coming to the highway			0
@entity32 has signed agreements with three partners : the @entity211 music service , @entity213 internet radio and @entity214 , which helps users send and receive messages via @entity37			0
drivers will not be able to read the tweets on the dashboard -- instead , a computer voice will say them aloud			0
the three apps would live on users ' smartphones but would be controlled in the vehicle through @entity32 's @entity226 system , which allows motorists to operate mobile devices through voice commands or steering - wheel controls			2
the apps will be available later this year for any @entity32 vehicle with a @entity226 system			1
" when we saw the apps craze ... [ we realized ] there 's a consumer demand there , " said @entity234 , a technology communications manager at @entity32			2
@entity234 was quick to say that @entity32 would not approve apps -- such as video games -- that might distract the driver			2
" apps are becoming the norm for how people quickly and easily access the information they want , " @entity234 added			0
" people are used to getting information on demand			0
they have a digital life outside the car -- they should have a digital life inside the car			0

companies are opening app stores and bringing applications to tvs , netbooks and even cars
@entity22 launched an app store for netbooks at the @entity23 this week
@entity26 will launch an app store later this year for hdtvs and @entity267 players
