@entity0 , @entity1 -- pro-russian separatists in the eastern @entity1 city of @entity0 dug in friday despite an international deal aimed at being a key first step in resolving a crisis that has threatened to devolve into civil war			1
the separatists ' self - declared leader , @entity9 , said it is those aligned with the @entity13 - based national government who should vacate all public buildings , not the militants in @entity0			1
@entity9 , the head of a group called the @entity17 , addressed reporters on the heels of an agreement thursday between officials from @entity1 , the @entity22 , the @entity23 and @entity24			1
among other things , that deal calls for amnesty for @entity29 factions provided they give up their weapons and leave government buildings			2
but separatists in eastern @entity1 have not signed on nor indicated they intend to , unless the @entity35 government in @entity13 steps down			1
" @entity36 did not sign anything for us , he signed on behalf of the @entity24 , " @entity9 said friday , referring to @entity24 foreign minister @entity36			2
instead of any such agreement , @entity40 has pushed for a referendum by may 11 to ask residents whether they want sovereignty from @entity1			2
this step may be popular with those who view @entity1 's interim authorities -- who took power in february after the ouster of president @entity50 , who some saw as too closely aligned with @entity24 -- as illegitimate			1
@entity1 president @entity51 on friday criticized the " factions of communists ( who have ) refused to sign or even vote on the document " agreed to in @entity56 , @entity57			2
he and prime minister @entity58 urged them to do so , saying in a joint statement , " we have to do everything possible not to take this treasure of ( @entity1 unity ) from our children			2
" " we are calling on our compatriots to ( reach out ) to each other and give up actions aimed at hatred , and come back to ( work toward ) rebuilding a united @entity1 , " the two leaders said			2
in addition to groups disarming and returning seized buildings to their legitimate owners , @entity58 and @entity51 spoke of plans to change the constitution , provide " more powers " and " necessary financial resources " to the regions and allow for @entity24 and other languages in addition to @entity1			1
" we are all different , but we all have one thing in common : we are all citizens of a sovereign and independent @entity1 , " the leaders said			2
but the key to the @entity56 agreement is whether @entity24 can and does use its influence to persuade protesters to comply			1
acting @entity1 foreign minister @entity89 told reporters friday in @entity13 that @entity24 still must prove its intentions in @entity1 are sincere			1
" i do n't know the @entity24 intentions , but minister @entity36 did promise that they want to de-escalate , so we will see in a few days if it was ( a ) sincere promise and sincere participation , " he said			1
@entity89 said the @entity1 government 's " anti-terrorist operation " against the @entity100 protesters who have taken control of key sites will continue , but its intensity will " depend on the practical implementation " of the pact			1
so far the show of force has done little to bring the eastern region back under @entity13 's control			0
monitoring mission all sides agreed on thursday to ask for monitors from the @entity113 , which has a mission in @entity1 , to help implement the measures aimed at easing the crisis			2
@entity89 said there would be a meeting later friday at the @entity119 with leaders of the mission to discuss the process by which occupied buildings will be handed over			0
he noted @entity113 had " over 100 monitors " in the country			0
the @entity126 organization released a statement friday describing the situation in western and central @entity1 as calm , whereas the @entity131 and @entity0 districts were " tense due to the activity of armed opponents of the central government and @entity1 special forces conducting a ' counterterrorist operation			1
' " the @entity113 noted , for example , that the state security service building in @entity139 was occupied			0
observers saw evidence of blood , gunfire and @entity145 cocktails at a military base in @entity147			0
a hospital official indicated five people had been treated for gunshot wounds , and local government officials reported three dead , according to @entity113			0
this unsettled situation speaks to the drama , tension and challenges for those hoping for a speedy , peaceful resolution			0
even as he announced the pact thursday , @entity22 secretary of state @entity158 stressed that the proof of the agreement would be in its swift implementation on the ground			0
" the job will not be done until these principles are implemented and are followed up on , " he said			0
@entity158 warned @entity24 could face " further costs " if the situation does not de-escalate in line with the concrete steps set out in the statement			2
@entity1 's leaders must also play their part in calming the situation , he said			2
caution , skepticism greet deal his boss , @entity22 president @entity176 , said the hope is that " diplomacy may de-escalate the situation , " but admitted that is not a given			0
" i do n't think we can be sure of anything at this point , " he said at a news conference thursday			0
the president added the @entity22 and its allies " have to be prepared -- potentially -- to respond " to continued efforts by @entity24 to interfere in southern and eastern @entity1			1
already , he signed off on more nonlethal aid to @entity1 's military and state border guard service			1
at the same time , @entity176 said @entity22 military options are still not on the table " because this is not a situation that would be amendable to a clear military solution			0
" rear adm. @entity197 , the @entity198 press secretary , told @entity2 's " @entity202 " that the focus now was " appropriately on diplomatic and economic pressure " rather than military might			0
" we 're hopeful about the agreement			0
now it 's time for @entity24 to meet the obligations under that agreement and to help disarm , and to remove from those buildings , those armed militants , " he said			2
anti-semitic fliers in eastern @entity1 denounced @entity211 : intervention still an option the emergency talks in @entity56 were called amid the spiraling crisis in @entity1 that has seen @entity217 relations at their most strained since the end of the @entity219			0
even as the negotiations in @entity56 were under way , @entity24 president @entity211 made clear in his annual televised call - in session with the @entity24 people that military intervention in @entity1 remains an option			1
@entity226 denies it has any intention of invading but says it reserves the right to protect @entity24 speakers in eastern @entity1			1
it has warned in the past week that @entity1 is " on the brink of a civil war			0
" @entity234 says @entity24 has about 40,000 troops assembled near @entity1 's eastern border			1
in a story posted friday on the website of @entity24 's state - owned @entity241 , @entity238 spokesman @entity237 acknowledged additional @entity24 troops were moved close to the @entity1 border " due to the instability of the political situation			1
" " it is a country where they just had a coup , " he said , referring to @entity50 's ouster , " and any country would take measures to provide security			0
and also we should remember that @entity24 is an absolutely free country and has a right to move their military			0
" @entity211 recently ceded that @entity24 forces had been active in @entity1 's @entity259 region to support local defense forces , the first time he has acknowledged the deployment of @entity24 troops on the @entity265 peninsula			1
@entity237 explained that @entity211 made this decision only after citizens in the majority @entity24 - speaking peninsula voted last month to align with @entity24			0
" @entity259 was an act of protection of @entity24 people and their right to have a referendum , " he said			0
the spokesman defended @entity226 and sharply criticized the @entity22 and @entity23 for their " hypocrisy " for siding with " illegal , armed groups ( who ) won a so - called revolution			0
" @entity211 wo n't back down in the face of @entity35 demands and under the threat of sanctions , he said			1
" @entity24 should not be addressed or treated like a schoolgirl with a checklist of things to do , " @entity237 said			1
@entity1 military push appears to lose momentum in the east diplomats agree on steps to de-escalate tensions in @entity1 opinion : is @entity1 about to go nuclear again ? @entity2 's @entity294 reported from @entity0 , @entity295 wrote and reported from @entity296 , and @entity297 wrote and reported from @entity298			1
