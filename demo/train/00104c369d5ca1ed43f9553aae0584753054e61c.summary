-- the only thing @entity2 treasures more than winning is a decent nap			1
@entity2 knocks @entity4 out of the @entity5 on february 17 , 2009			1
just before a match , when other top tennis players might be psyching themselves up for a three - set onslaught , the elder of the @entity2 sisters can be found somewhere private , snoozing			1
" i 'm always sleepy , " she told @entity0 in an interview for this month 's edition of " revealed			1
" " i 'm literally taking a nap during the first set and the match before me , so i 'm probably the only person that can go to sleep , come out 15 minutes later and start playing			1
" wary of sending the wrong signals to her rivals , the sixth seed confessed to @entity0 that she prefers to take her naps in private			1
" i 'm wondering if my competitor is going to see me here , so i try to act like i 'm not asleep , but i am asleep , or i try to find a place where i can sleep in and no one will see me , " she laughs			0
the lightning - fast speed of @entity2 ' serve is at complete odds with her personality			2
she is strong , ambitious and determined , but also surprisingly laid - back for someone whose professional career is about playing harder , longer and faster			2
" i just always go with the flow , " she told @entity0			0
" on the court , that 's when i get most intense			2
in practice , i scream and yell and threaten to throw my racquet but in the match i 'm not like that at all			2
" her younger sister , world number one @entity37 , sounds almost envious of @entity2 ' ability to keep her emotions in check			1
" @entity2 is really , really unusually composed and that 's just her style , " @entity37 told @entity0			1
" on the court she 's always really focused			2
she always has this quiet tenacity and she never really shows her emotions which i think is good			0
" the youngest of five sisters , @entity37 says she continues to draw inspiration from her closest sibling			2
@entity2 is just 15 months older than @entity37			1
she set the marker for success in 2002 when she became the first of the sisters to become world number one			1
@entity37 first took the title in july of the same year and reclaimed it earlier this month			2
" she 's my bigger sister , she 's my older sister , she 's a role model for me , " @entity37 said			1
" i 'm always trying to do what she does			0
if she 's going on the right path then i 'm going on the right path too			0
if she 's working hard then i want to work hard also			0
i 'm the little sister who wants to be just like the big sister , " she added			0
if they once struggled to find the required ruthlessness to eliminate each other from a competition , it is clearly no longer a problem			0
of 18 matches they have contested , each sister has won nine			0
at the time of writing , there is every chance they will meet again this week in the semi-final of the @entity5			1
they last clashed at the @entity78 in @entity79 in november 2008 when @entity2 dispatched @entity37 in three hard - fought sets before going on to win her first end of season title			1
asked after the match about accusations they do n't play as hard against each other as they would normal rivals , @entity2 replied , " you have to play hard against a @entity2 or you are going home quickly			1
we try our hardest and i think that everyone knows that by the effort level			0
" their mother , @entity93 , told @entity0 she keeps her advice on the subject simple			0
" i just tell them to remember they are sisters and how love and how to care for one another is more important than anything , " she said			0
" so , this is just a game and eventually it would be over and you will have to live with each other			0
so , just go out there and do your best and whoever wins , wins			0
and whoever loses , better luck next time			0
" having said that , @entity93 admits she keeps her distance from whoever comes out second best , in any match			2
" they do n't want to be talked to , they do n't want you telling them anything , they just want to be left alone and that 's what i do , " she told @entity0			0
there is no need for tip - toeing today			0
@entity2 made fast work of @entity122 @entity4 , beating the 17 - year - old 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 in less than one hour in the second round of the @entity5			1
@entity2 told @entity0 her ambition this year is to topple @entity37 to become the world number one			1
" i think i am in a great position to do that , " she said			0
