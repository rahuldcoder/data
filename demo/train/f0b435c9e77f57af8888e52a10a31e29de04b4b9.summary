@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 finds a tiny glimmer of good news in @entity1 in a new report out wednesday , saying that violence against civilians fell in the first half of the year			1
but even with attacks down 15 % compared with the first six months of 2011 , violence is taking a " devastating toll on civilians , " the @entity3 said			1
it cited the case of a father who brought his family to collect @entity16 cards from a government office in @entity19 province , leaving his children and their mother by the gate while he went to find staff members			0
" i heard a loud explosion and i ran back to the gate			0
i saw people lying in blood on the ground			0
i saw one of my daughters dead on the ground and my other three daughters and their mother wounded , " said the man , who was not named in the report			0
another of his daughters later died of her wounds in the april attack that left 13 people dead and 57 wounded , the @entity3 said			2
they were among 1,145 people killed and 1,954 injured in the first six months of the year , the report found			0
that 's down from 1,510 killed and 2,144 injured in the same period a year earlier			0
but the drop does little more than to bring levels of violence down to what they were in 2010 , says the report from the @entity52			1
still , the drop marks the first time in five years there has been a fall rather than a rise in violence against civilians , the report said			1
eighty percent of the attacks against civilians are by anti-government forces such as the @entity63 , the @entity3 said , while 10 % are by government forces			1
the world body could not determine responsibility for the other 10 % , the report said			0
the @entity63 rejected the report as " baseless and untrue , " saying its fighters were taking more care not to kill civilians			1
" our freedom fighters are now more responsible and careful when it comes to civilian casualties			0
that is why , in general , civilian casualty has decreased , " @entity63 spokesman @entity76 said			2
he also disputed the @entity3 definition of " civilian , " saying : " the @entity0 administration and whoever either works for them or supports them in one way or the other can be our target			2
" he accused " the invaders " and the government of killing , injuring and jailing civilians , and said the @entity3 report did not include them			1
" the @entity1 people are our own people , and those who do n't have any links with invaders will always be safe , and we would put our lives at great risk to keep them safe , " he said .			2
