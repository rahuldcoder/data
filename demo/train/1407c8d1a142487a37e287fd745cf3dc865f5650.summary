-- vice president @entity1 has been the topic of much discussion this past week as to whether he was playing racial politics in what has become the " chains speech " in @entity7 , @entity8			1
commentators , political pundits , politicians and academics have weighed in			0
but through all of the hoopla , it is important to probe the statement that preceded @entity1 saying to the audience at the @entity17 : " they 're going to put y'all back in chains			1
" here is @entity1 's full statement from the speech : " ( @entity28 ) @entity27 wants to let -- he said in the first hundred days , he 's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules			1
' they 're going to put y'all back in chains			0
" knock yourself out focusing on the racial implications of what @entity1 had to say			2
because when i look at the number of @entity38 still underwater because of the dastardly things that took place in the housing market ; when i look at the number of banks that took billions in federal funds supposedly to provide credit to @entity38 , only to use it to shore up their balance sheets ; and when i look at the banking industry fighting tooth and nail to prevent future regulations , that to me is far more vital to determining who we should cast our vote for in november			1
@entity54 , the independent watchdog appointed to investigate the @entity57 program , wrote in his book , " bailout : an @entity60 while rescuing @entity29 , " that the federal government committed $ 23.7 trillion in various initiatives to save the financial industry			1
yes , $ 23.7 trillion			0
not all was spent , but that figure begins to get at the depth at which @entity29 had devastated this country with its reckless behavior			2
@entity27 , who made his millions in private equity , is most certainly the guy @entity29 is betting big on			1
millions are flowing into his coffers from @entity29 because he has made it clear that he is going to pretty much say , " @entity75 , it 's business as usual ! " we could have some faith in his vice presidential pick , @entity38 rep. @entity79 of @entity80 , who has talked openly about reinstating the @entity82 , which was enacted in 1933 to protect @entity38 by preventing commercial banks from also being investment banks			1
yet it was the repeal in 1999 of that important law 's restrictions , a repeal led by @entity89 sen. @entity88 , of @entity90			0
and signed by @entity93 president @entity92 , that is largely to blame for the current crisis			0
far too few banks are in control of far too much of the nation 's money , and when the shameful and evil ways they make money end up almost collapsing the economy , taxpayers are left to bail them out			1
@entity79 voted for repeal on @entity82 in 1999 , but is on the record recently as saying @entity82 should return			0
but the man at the top of the ticket is n't so sure , which means that @entity79 will have to keep his thoughts to himself			0
@entity27 and @entity79 are in lockstep in disagreeing with the passage of the @entity114 law , which was supposed to reform the banking industry , and that should cause many of us to be cautious as to why			1
let 's be clear : @entity114 is not a perfect bill			0
the financial lobby was successful at stripping away some of the toughest provisions of the law , and former @entity124 @entity93 sen. @entity123 was too willing to do their bidding			0
democrats and @entity89 are to blame for that , but at least the law is an effort to get @entity29 to clean up its act			2
@entity27 seems to want @entity29 to keep doing what it 's been doing , offering no specifics on what kinds of regulations should be imposed to put it in check			1
he definitely wants to repeal @entity114 , but wo n't say what he 'll replace it with			0
when @entity137 announced it lost $ 3 billion a few months ago , @entity27 essentially shrugged his shoulders and said that 's the free market enterprise for you			2
but when that free market enterprise results in our economy almost collapsing , resulting in @entity29 needing more than a trillion dollars of infusion from the @entity38 taxpayer and the @entity148 , it sure is n't free to us			1
far too many banks have been horrible at working with the millions of homeowners who face foreclosure , as evidence by stories done by many reporters , including @entity0 's @entity155 ? nothing			2
go to www.mittromney.com and see if you find anything confronting the housing crisis			0
judging by the voting record of @entity164 , we surely ca n't expect him to work to change @entity27 's mind			1
@entity79 was one of only 64 @entity168 members to vote against a law requiring credit card companies to notify cardholders they were going to raise their interest rates ( it passed )			0
he voted no on a bill to allow the @entity177 to offer $ 300 billion in loans to community banks to assist small businesses ( it passed )			0
he voted yes to strip the @entity182 of some of its toughest rules , instead wanting to soften it up ( it failed )			0
and he voted yes on a bill that delayed for a year new regulations on the kind of derivatives that created the financial mess we 're in right now ( it passed )			0
it is clear that @entity29 does n't care about @entity38 consumers , except to keep them shackled in debt through sky high credit card balances , thus allowing the financial industry to make billions off the high interest rates			1
bankers fought hard to keep hitting account holders with hidden fees , again lining their pockets			0
and they sure as heck are n't doing enough to stabilize the housing market by drawing down principals and placing a moratorium on foreclosures			2
so we should recognize @entity27 's recipe of ideas as a disaster for consumers and a boon for @entity29			1
you can be angry all you want about @entity1 's chains comments , but you better be just as upset if we have to go through another financial calamity like we did in 2008 when @entity29 ran amok and took us for suckers in an effort to tap into our pocketbooks again , courtesy of the @entity177			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : in context @entity1 's " chains " comments make sense , are about banking industry
he says out - of - control banks caused housing collapse , took bailout money from taxpayers
he says @entity27 will continue business as usual with financial industry , opposes controls
@entity223 : @entity29 does n't care about @entity38 consumers , except to keep them shackled in debt
