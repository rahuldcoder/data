when it comes to purchasing products on the internet that claim to treat or cure @entity4 , the @entity0 has one word for consumers : beware ! this week the @entity0 sent warning letters to three companies the government agency says are selling products over the internet that claim to treat , prevent or even cure the deadly disease			1
the letters were issued after an alert warning consumers about fraudulent @entity4 products being hawked online went out last month			1
" we have a program at @entity0 that monitors the @entity11 to look for health fraud products , products not approved by @entity0 that claim to cure or treat disease , " said @entity17 , the @entity0 's deputy commissioner for global regulatory operations and policy			1
" we noticed that when there is a public health issue that really comes to the fore ( front ) -- for example @entity29 a few years ago , and now @entity4 -- there tends to be an increase in health fraud products , which are products that claim to prevent , treat or cure disease and the product has not been approved by @entity0			1
" the agency says they 've had consumer complaints about the number of products making these claims , and that the websites of @entity40 of @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , based in @entity47 , @entity45 , all offer products that are in direct violation of the @entity51 because they 're being promoted as drugs that can fight the infection			1
in early august , @entity0 says a @entity46 consultant posted these tweets about @entity4 prevention : " treating the symptoms of @entity4 with @entity58 , " and " many essential oils are highly anti-viral			1
i list here a few of them those ( sic ) oils that could help prevent your contracting the ebola virus			2
" according to the agency , @entity43 essential oils products were being sold on various websites with claims including , " viruses ( including @entity4 ) are no match for @entity71 , " and " @entity4 can not live in the presence of cinnamon bark ( this is in @entity74 ) nor @entity75			1
" " thieves " is one of the oils @entity43 sells			2
the company 's website says " it is highly effective in supporting the immune system and good health			2
" the listed ingredients are clove , lemon , cinnamon eucalyptus and rosemary			2
@entity88 , chief operating officer of @entity43 issued this statement to @entity90 : " @entity43 is cooperating fully with the @entity0 regarding its inquiry			1
@entity93 are provided specific instructions on how to promote our products to their customers			2
in the coming days we will be contacting all our membership to ensure that they understand how to best use our products and remain compliant with regulatory directives			2
we have already contacted each of the members cited in the @entity0 letter to help get them into compliance			1
" @entity40 , which claims its product @entity106 kills every pathogen it 's been tested against without exception , had plenty to say in defense of the posted claims , including that " @entity112 , at 10 @entity113 ( parts per million ) effectively kills the ebola virus			2
" @entity116 , a retired lawyer and trustee at @entity40 , says the company was advocating the nutritional benefits of @entity106 years before the @entity4 outbreak			1
" we feel obligated to speak the truth , especially during a world health emergency that is happening in @entity123			2
so we welcomed @entity125 's declaration that even ' unproven interventions ' can be used in this crisis and that is what we have tried to do , " @entity116 said			2
" insofar as the word ' cure ' is used , it was not intended to be the equivalent of an @entity0 - approved treatment but rather in the common usage of the word as something which would help a person get over the disease			1
" @entity116 cites a 2009 study on @entity106 sponsored by the @entity140 's @entity139 as support for the product			0
he says a presentation created from that study ( @entity145 ) showed " the nutrient at 10 ppm ( parts per million ) regulated ebola virus replication which may prevent the disease from killing it 's victims			1
" those familiar with the government research say the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) funds a tremendous number of early stage science and technology projects that are tasked with countering nuclear , chemical or biological threats			0
@entity106 was studied , but scientists determined there were other things that were a better investment			0
if the early research had proven promising , they say the research would have picked up by other agencies			0
" the @entity139 funded a research project between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2009 into a product called @entity106 , " a spokesperson , who did not want to be identified , said			0
" the researchers produced slides at the end of that early science research			0
the data in that presentation was not peer reviewed			0
" the @entity0 is firm : " at this point there are no drugs or vaccines that have been shown to be safe and effective to treat or prevent @entity4 disease , " dr. @entity176 , the @entity0 's assistant commissioner for counterterrorism policy and acting deputy chief scientist , says			1
" @entity0 is doing all it can do to help expedite development programs			1
" @entity176 says there are currently two vaccines in development			0
one is already in " @entity188 " clinical trials ; the other is expected to begin trials soon			0
she also says there are a handful of drugs in early stages of development for @entity4 , but that it 's very difficult to say how soon it will be before we have treatments available for patients			1
it depends in part on the results of these trials			0
in the meantime , the agency says , @entity11 " cures " are not the answer			0
" we are continuing to monitor the internet and monitor how these three companies respond , " @entity17 said			1
" they have 15 working days to take corrective action			0
if they do n't take the corrective action , we can take enforcement action against them ... seizure , injunction , criminal prosecution			0
" @entity40 says they will meet that deadline			0
" we will offer to make further disclosures and disclaimers , including more carefully nuanced terminology , " @entity116 said			0
" we are not in the business of violating the law but we are in the business of speaking the truth as we know it			0
" @entity90 made several efforts to contact representatives of @entity46 over two days and left messages , but there was no response .			0
