@entity0 -- some may not realize that the modern @entity2 owes its origin to the fight over slavery nearly two centuries ago			1
in the tumultuous mid- 1800s , right before the @entity7 , some political activists were concerned about keeping slavery from spreading into new western territories , and they saw no way to stop it through existing political powers : the @entity12 and the @entity13 ( the pro-congress party of the mid 1800s that largely destroyed itself in the 1852 elections in a battle over slavery )			1
so they formed a new party , taking the name " republicans " in a salute to earlier @entity24 politicians			2
by 1861 , they had their first president : @entity27			1
soon after , slavery fell			0
and the @entity2 began a long steady rise in power			1
even back then , the party liked to talk about fiscal responsibility -- immigration , religion -- and the need for a strong business climate			0
all of this spurred a sympathetic @entity40 newspaper to call the @entity2 the @entity2 , or the @entity2			1
@entity2 voters were strongest in rural and western parts of the country , and they were highly successful at maximizing electoral votes to produce presidents : @entity46 and @entity47 were among their early successes			2
however , @entity49 brought sharp policy disagreements to the party			0
and when @entity52 ushered in the @entity53 , the @entity2 were driven into retreat			2
it would be 20 years until they won the @entity56 again , under @entity57			0
but since 1969 , they have been largely back to their winning ways			0
during that time , @entity2 have been in the @entity61 for almost twice as many years as the @entity12 -- @entity62 ( elected to two terms , but resigned at the start of his second ) , @entity66 ( served out @entity62 's second term ) , @entity68 ( elected to two terms ) , @entity70 ( elected to one term ) and @entity72 ( elected to two terms )			1
now @entity74 is hoping to restart that tradition .			0
