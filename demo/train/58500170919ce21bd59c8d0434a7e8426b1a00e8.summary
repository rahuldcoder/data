-- thank you , @entity2 , for not changing the ending			1
earlier wednesday , @entity4 ran a long profile of @entity6 that quoted him as saying that @entity7 , whose fate was left hanging in the show 's famous , sudden cut to black , had lived			1
the news was , very quickly , everywhere			2
but it appears that the sphinx - like @entity2 was taken , perhaps , too literally			1
in a statement , his publicist said , " a journalist for @entity15 misconstrued what @entity2 said in their interview			1
to simply quote @entity2 as saying , ' @entity7 is not dead , ' is inaccurate			1
there is a much larger context for that statement and as such , it is not true			2
" as @entity2 has said numerous times on the record , ' @entity26 is alive or dead is not the point			1
' to continue to search for this answer is fruitless			0
the final scene of ' @entity32 ' raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer			1
" glad that 's settled			2
for seven years , viewers have puzzled about the scene that closed out " @entity32			1
" in that finale , there were ominous portents afoot : a mysterious man in a @entity43 jacket , daughter @entity44 's cross against traffic to meet everyone at a restaurant			2
and @entity7 , despite having ended therapy with @entity50 and beaten the @entity52 mob , was still gripped by angst			0
so the cut to black , jarring and in the middle of " @entity56 , " was a shock			0
if we wanted some conclusion about @entity7 's life -- whether he lived or died -- it was going to go unresolved			2
it was perfect because " @entity32 " was as much about the pointless details of life as it was about the classic arcs of storytelling			1
for every brutal whacking , there was a @entity71 escaping through the @entity72			0
for every guilty verdict , there was a guy who did n't get caught			0
as @entity90 writes in @entity91 , " ' @entity32 ' was never about ending mysteries , it was about recognizing and exploring the mysteries of everyday life : the mysteries of personality , motivation , conditioning and free will , as expressed through behavior and conversation and action , and as translated into metaphor through fantasies and dreams			1
" yeah , maybe the cut to black did n't have the neat resolution of a pulp novel			0
but thematically it was of a piece with the rest of the series , which was always as much about uncertainty and the struggle for reconciliation as it was about mob justice			0
for years , @entity6 has refused to say what happened to @entity7			1
some critics thought it was his way of telling the viewers who loved the violence -- and ignored the more philosophical aspects of the show -- to go f * * * themselves , to borrow a phrase			0
@entity6 did n't see it that way			1
he just thought it was unnecessary			0
that did n't stop fans from grasping at details as if they 'd wandered into a @entity121 novel			0
and this guy spent thousands of words and dozens of clips to arrive at his ultimate conclusion			2
listen : sometimes you die surrounded by loved ones , waiting for the light , exclaiming , " oh wow oh wow oh wow			0
" sometimes your scarf gets tangled in a car axle and breaks your neck			0
but , most of the time , you just go on , trying to make sense of it all and never succeeding			0
now that @entity6 has let the pendulum swing once again , let 's hope it keeps swinging			1
to " know " the ending of " @entity32 " is no more useful than knowing that @entity138 was a sled settles the meaning of " @entity141			1
" ( sorry , spoiler alert			0
) some things are better left unsettled			2
do n't get any ideas , @entity146 .			0

@entity2 gives interview in which he talks about end of " @entity32 "
statement says @entity6 's words about @entity153 were misconstrued
leaving end unsettled is truer to @entity6 's *vision*
