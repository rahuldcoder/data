-- president @entity1 invoked @entity3 's name during wednesday 's presidential debate , claiming that @entity6 presidential candidate @entity5 would consider the mogul 's empire a small business			1
" under governor @entity5 's definition , there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses , " president @entity1 said			1
" @entity3 is a small business			1
now , i know @entity3 does n't like to think of himself as small anything -- but that 's how you define small businesses if you 're getting business income			2
" the facts : while there is no universally accepted definition of a small business , the federal government defines it as any business that employs fewer than 500 people			1
the @entity31 employs 22,000 people			0
but @entity3 also runs a number of other companies that employ fewer than 500 , meaning that -- under the federal government 's definition -- he qualifies as a small business			1
according to the @entity40 @entity39 , which uses the 500 - worker maximum in its definition , such firms employ half of all private - sector workers and pay 44 % of the total @entity40 private payroll			0
in 2009 , there were 27.5 million businesses in the nation , 99.7 % of which were small firms			0
complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity52 @entity54 data on the highest - income people in the country underscores that small business does not necessarily mean small profits			2
of the top 400 people â € ” who got $ 19.8 billion in s corporation and partnership net income in 2009 â € ” 237 count as small businesses			0
an analysis by the @entity66 finds that extending tax cuts for people who make more than $ 250,000 per year ( $ 200,000 for single filers ) would disproportionately help the richest taxpayers : 82 % of the cut would go to people with more than $ 1 million in adjusted gross income , who would get an average tax cut of $ 164,000 apiece			0
@entity5 's plan does not single out small businesses for special treatment			2
his plan attempts to lower taxes on all businesses -- big or small			0
conclusion : while @entity5 's plan does not define who is or is not a small business , some of @entity3 's companies would qualify as a small business because they have fewer than 500 employees			1
fact check : @entity89 energy fact check : job creation versus unemployment fact check : oil and gas production @entity96 's small business reporter @entity95 and @entity0 's @entity97 contributed to this report			0
