-- artist @entity1 is the man the behind the rictus grin that has become his work 's motif			1
part self portrait , part parody , part social commentary , his paintings have made him one the most instantly recognized contemporary artists in @entity10			1
born in 1962 , @entity1 graduated from the @entity11 in 1989 , the year that authorities cracked down on student protests in @entity10 , most notably in @entity14			1
@entity1 admits that those events and the subsequent changes in @entity10 society have had a major effect on his life and work			1
" politics is part of my daily life			2
it is there every day , " he told @entity0			2
" the paintings reflect it and i ca n't escape it ... it affects me greatly			1
" " i also ask why after @entity10 experienced so many changes and so much progress we 're still so immature politically			1
why is it that we can not resolve some of our daily problems politically ? it seems like we 're still struggling			2
... i have a feeling that our nation is the most politically immature nation			2
" art critics have often labeled his early work " critical realism , " a term that encompassed a number of @entity10 artists in the early 1990s that used satire to juxtapose capitalism and consumerism with @entity10 communism			1
@entity1 says that the laughing character of his work was developed in response to the changes that @entity10 experienced since 1989			1
" it has a lot to do with the changes brought about by @entity10 's reform			1
the changes cause the changes in people 's behavior , very fast changes too			2
people 's emotions are different too , full and stimulating			0
the laughing faces represent the emotional feelings of the people			0
" many of his pieces painted in the early 1990s have become highly sought after			0
" @entity72 " became the most expensive painting by a contemporary @entity10 artist when it was sold in 2007 for $ 5.9 million			1
while that record is now held by another artist , his earlier works still attract high prices from collectors			1
" on the @entity80 " was sold for $ 1.8 million in @entity79 on april 5 , 2010			0
subsequently he 's become a forger 's favorite			0
" i do n't know who is copying me so there 's no reason to be mad at anybody			0
there are too many of them			0
maybe they like my work			2
from the intellectual property point of view , they should not sign my name and sell them			0
it 's not good for customers			0
it 'd be fine if they sign their own names , " he said			0
while that famous smile may remain in some of his work in the future , @entity1 believes that @entity10 could do with slowing the pace of social change			1
" just slow down a bit maybe , so as to let people catch up with the same pace and so to live in a rather stable way			0
going too fast would just make people lose balance , and somehow feel being abandoned or isolated , which is not good to the society as a whole , " he said .			0
