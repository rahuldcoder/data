@entity0 , @entity1 -- it began as routine training with new sonar equipment on an @entity1 lake			1
but what highway patrolmen found from their boat was macabre			1
and , as they were to discover later , there were bones and skulls inside			1
then , equally surprising , they found another car			1
and it had bones inside it , too			1
rusted and caked with mud , a 1952 @entity19 and a 1969 @entity20 held as many as six bodies			1
the recovery of the vehicles and remains tuesday have residents near @entity0 , a reservoir about 110 miles west of @entity27 , wondering whether two mysteries -- involving disappearances that the town of @entity31 never forgot -- can finally be put to rest			1
investigators say they believe one car may have belonged to a teenager who disappeared with two friends in 1970 , and the other car could be linked to the disappearance of a man in the 1960s who a federal official says was with a sibling and a friend , officials told @entity2 and its affiliates @entity46 and @entity47			1
@entity48 , a diver with the @entity49 , was sent down on tuesday , one week after the sonar located the corroding vehicles			1
they were right next to each other , at a depth of 12 feet and 50 feet from a marina			2
he , like others , had no idea how the vehicles -- which faced in different directions -- came to be in the lake			1
@entity63 located an open door and felt a shoe			2
" it did n't really cross my mind as to a body being there			2
it could have just been a shoe , " the trooper told @entity2 on wednesday			2
skeletal remains were seen when the car was brought to shore			1
now authorities are trying to positively identify the remains , a process that could take years , and try to learn what happened			2
so much time has passed in the two cases that the son of one missing person is now 85 and struggling with dementia			1
