-- both @entity1 and @entity2 have embarked on programs to protect their tropical rainforests , which contain a rich treasury of life			2
although many millions of species are known to inhabit this ecosystem , quantifying precisely how many plants and animals rely on the rainforest is difficult			0
@entity12 of the @entity13 told @entity0 : " it is estimated that at least two - thirds of all @entity17 's terrestrial species are found in tropical forests			1
" the exact number of species which depend on tropical rainforests is not known -- but they are very old ecosystems that have survived ice ages and allowed uninterrupted evolution over millions of years			2
" in collating forest biodiversity research for @entity0 , the @entity13 highlighted one example that shows the astonishing variety of life : @entity30 in @entity31 is less than 0.5 % of the @entity33 basin but estimated to contain 100,000 species of insects -- or about the same as the whole of @entity37			1
environmental protection group , @entity38 , says a typical 10 - square - kilometre ( four - square - mile ) patch of rainforest contains as many as 1,500 flowering plants , 750 species of trees , 400 species of birds and 150 species of butterflies			2
and new species are being discovered all the time			0
in january , @entity0 reported that scientists had found 46 previously unknown species in southwest @entity51 in @entity52 -- including an amphibian nicknamed the @entity54 that has a mouth as wide as its body and a new species of insect , affectionately referred to as the @entity59			1
the @entity13 adds : " excluding microbes , it is estimated that about 6,200 species are discovered every year and given that tropical forests contain a disproportionately large number of @entity17 's land species , it can be assumed that many are in the forests			1
" as well its timber resources , the forests have provided agricultural land , food , water , minerals and energy -- and a home for many indigenous forest peoples			1
there are hidden benefits too			0
forest plants are a source of chemicals and medicines , some of which have been used in the treatment of cancers			0
the @entity87 in 2005 suggested that forests are the basis of more than 5,000 commercial products			0
