@entity0 , @entity1 -- many have pointed to lessons learned -- and heeded -- from the disappearance of @entity6			1
should there be tighter rules about who 's in the cockpit ? that 's happened			1
should the @entity1 military have acted more quickly after the airliner went missing nearly four weeks ago ? they 've launched an investigation			1
are there better ways to track commercial aircraft -- especially when , as in this case , its transponder is turned off ? an international aviation organization says it will consider " all of the options			2
" but as much as things might change because of this mystery , it does n't change the fact that -- for yet another day -- there are 239 families still grieving , still waiting , still venting over authorities ' inability to answer what happened to the @entity33			2
" we want to provide comfort to the families and we will not rest until answers are indeed found , " @entity1 prime minister @entity34 said thursday during a visit to a military base near the @entity38 city of @entity39 , which has become the hub for search operations			1
mystery of @entity6 surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy yes , authorities have said communications mysteriously , and seemingly purposefully , cut off shortly into the @entity52 - bound flight			2
yes , satellite data suggests the aircraft turned back over @entity1 before terminating somewhere in the vast southern @entity55			1
yet there have been no solid leads about why any of this happened or where the plane ended up			2
in fact , officials do n't seem to know all that much more on day 27 after it disappeared sometime after leaving @entity0 than they did on day 1			2
@entity38 prime minister @entity64 on thursday described the search for the plane as " the most difficult in human history " and warned there was no guarantee it would be found			1
" we can not be certain of ultimate success in the search for @entity6 , " he said at a news briefing in @entity39 , standing alongside @entity34			1
" but we can be certain that we will spare no effort -- that we will not rest -- until we have done everything we humanly can			1
" all 227 passengers have been cleared of any role in hijacking or sabotage or having psychological or personal issues that might have played a role in the plane 's disappearance , the inspector general of @entity1 police , @entity86 , told reporters wednesday			1
police said wednesday a review of a flight simulator found in a pilot 's house proved inconclusive			1
and senior @entity1 government officials told @entity2 last week that authorities have found nothing about either of the pilots to suggest a motive			1
there have been no such public comments about the other 10 crew members , however			0
" we do n't have enough evidence to take ( hijacking , sabotage or many other possibilities ) off the table , " @entity101 , a former @entity102 pilot and military officer , told @entity2			1
" what we need to do is keep an open mind , look at the facts , and keep building the jigsaw puzzle			0
because that 's all we have at the moment			1
" on thursday , up to eight aircraft will set out looking for telltale debris across an 91,500 square - mile ( 237,000 square - kilometer ) zone , the @entity119 says			0
up to nine ships will search , including one @entity102 submarine racing against time to hear the signature pinging from flight 370 's flight data recorder			1
there could be a breakthrough imminently ; a seat cushion , a soda can , a life jacket could be spotted and scooped up , leading to the rest of the plane and , ultimately , to explain what happened			1
so far , though , nothing has been found			1
in fact , it might be someone dipping her toes off a beach in @entity38 or @entity140 or @entity1 who first notices something			1
" we 'll keep going til hell freezes over , " @entity143 , @entity38 's former defense minister and current ambassador to the @entity145 , told @entity2 's @entity146			1
" it could take months , it could take years			0
" official pleads for patience last friday , officials announced that -- based on new analysis of satellite data -- they 'd shifted the search area significantly closer to @entity38 's northwest coast			1
it moved again from tuesday to wednesday , albeit not as extensively			0
on thursday , it moved again , a little farther north			0
why ? @entity143 explained it 's because " we 're eliminating areas from our inquiry " and moving to adjacent areas			1
yet @entity166 , a @entity2 safety analyst and author of " @entity168 , " said " from the outside looking in , it just does n't seem to make a lot of sense			0
" " it just looks like they 're following information and data that they 're not confident in , " @entity166 said			0
authorities have been upfront about many things they do n't know about flight 370 -- things like altitude , speed and direction that are key to pinpointing its final resting place			0
then there are questions about who and what was aboard			0
while the passengers were cleared , investigators are still questioning relatives of all of those on the plane -- having already interviewed about 170 people -- as well as those who may have had access to it			1
that includes scrutinizing those who prepared food for the flight , those who packed the cargo , and those who were to receive the cargo in @entity200			0
" everything from beginning to end , " said @entity86 , the @entity1 police official			1
police are considering four criminal possibilities : hijacking , sabotage , personal problems and psychological issues , though mechanical failure has n't been ruled out			1
@entity86 stressed getting answers wo n't be easy , nor will it be quick			2
" we have to clear every little thing , " said @entity86			0
" you can not hurry us in whatever we are doing			0
" ' we can not let another aircraft simply disappear ' even without anything definitive , @entity220 has taken proactive steps to beef up cockpit security , two sources familiar with the airline 's operations told @entity2 on wednesday			2
a new directive says no pilot or first officer is allowed to sit alone in the cockpit			0
whenever one of them is outside the cockpit , a senior cabin steward must remain inside			0
" these changes are positive in nature and directly relate to the @entity6 incident , " one of the sources told @entity2			0
this policy is n't new everywhere : it 's long been in place for the @entity145 , experts note			2
" what they put in place is pretty common sense , " said @entity242 , a @entity2 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity145 @entity244			0
other reforms could be coming as well , and not just affecting @entity220			0
@entity250 , director general and ceo of the @entity252 , in a recent speech pointed to " disbelief both that an aircraft could simply disappear and that the ' black box ' is so difficult to recover			2
" he added , " we can not let another aircraft simply disappear			0
" toward that end , the association will form a task force that will include participation by the @entity261 to " examine all of the options available for tracking commercial aircraft " and then to report its conclusions by december			0
a second lesson concerns security , @entity250 said , citing the fact two passengers with phony passports were able to board the missing jetliner unchallenged			2
though these two men have since been cleared , the incident underscores a need for governments to do better checking passenger lists , he said			2
" airlines are neither border guards nor policemen ; that is the well - established responsibility of governments			0
" family members still have questions such changes are all well and good			0
but they wo n't bring back the scores thought to have perished on flight 370			0
on wednesday , families of 18 @entity200 passengers -- out of 154 @entity200 aboard -- met privately in @entity0 for three hours with @entity1 government officials and investigators			1
the meeting had been called after they accused @entity1 of not being upfront about the investigation			1
families of newlyweds still waiting @entity295 , head of @entity1 's civil aviation department , said it was " a very good meeting			1
" " we answered all their questions			0
" the families ' representative saw it differently			0
" i personally believe today 's meeting had some progress , but the time was short and family members did n't have an opportunity to raise questions , " said @entity305			2
questions , questions , questions			0
there 's no shortage of them			2
chief among them is will the flight data recorder be found before batteries on its locator beacon die -- which , according to its design standards , would happen april 7			2
experts agree that it wo n't be easy , given all the unknowns			0
" they are looking in a vast area in very deep waters ... and we really have no idea where it went in , " said @entity327 , an @entity38 scientist who helped create the flight data recorders that , if found , could prove key to the investigation			1
" a needle in a haystack would be much easier to find			0
" 6 missteps in the investigation @entity340 : a mission of hope in search for @entity6 flight 370 : high - tech search tools @entity2 's @entity346 and @entity347 reported and wrote from @entity348 ; @entity349 and @entity350 reported from @entity0 ; @entity2 's @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 , @entity361 and @entity362 also contributed to this report .			1
