-- an @entity2 man convicted of raping his former neighbor and friend was sentenced november 13 to 20 years in a state penitentiary on the lead charge , and 10 years each on the lesser offenses			1
except that he was n't			2
the victim , @entity8 , told @entity0 she was outraged by the sentencing			0
" i do n't know how any of this is possible			0
" @entity11 , 25 , was convicted of one count of forcible rape and two counts of second - degree rape for attacks that @entity8 said started when she was 13			2
" honestly , i did n't understand when i first heard the sentence , " said @entity8 , now 20			2
" i was expecting him to spend a long time in prison			1
" she said she had n't talked about the abuse because of threats			0
" i had to grow up at a very , very young age , and i know what it 's like to have your life threatened and that no one will understand me			0
" even though the sentencing order says on its face that @entity11 will serve his time in a state penitentiary , that same order adds that he will serve none of his time in a state penitentiary			2
moreover , they are confused			0
was this a legal sentence ? if so , was it a moral sentence ? ' suspended ' sentences : when ' incarceration ' means anything but people have every reason to be confused			1
sentencing statutes are routinely complex , and @entity2 's is no exception			1
most state sentencing schemes follow a common theme , arriving at an individual 's punishment based on the 1 ) gravity of the offense ; and 2 ) the defendant 's prior record ; which can then be aggravated or mitigated by any other factors the court wants to consider			0
lately , in light of the @entity61 case , mandatory minimum sentences have been harshly criticized			0
" mando - mins " as they are sometimes called , force a judge to sentence a minimum number of years , preventing a judge from considering the individual defendant 's unique circumstances , and showing mercy where appropriate			1
the @entity11 case highlights the issue at the other end of the spectrum : whether judges can have too much discretion in sentencing convicted felons			1
in the @entity11 case , the judge 's discretion came from his authority to impose a " split sentence			1
" let 's look at the lead charge and the sentence , taken verbatim from the order of sentence : " @entity87 ( 20 ) years in the @entity88 , split sentence , to serve two ( 2 ) years in [ a community - based program ] , balance suspended and placed on three ( 3 ) years supervised probation			2
" yes , you read that right			0
it essentially says : twenty years in prison -- except that it will be zero years , and none of it in prison			2
the judge likely relied upon section 15 - 18 - 8 of the @entity101 , which explicitly gives judges discretion to suspend a significant portion of a defendant 's sentence			1
a suspended sentence is incarceration in name only : the defendant will serve that time out of custody			1
in this jurisdiction , for sentences between 15 and 20 years , it appears that a mandatory minimum applies : the judge must order at least three and up to five years , and then may suspend the rest			1
here 's where it gets strange : the @entity120 has held that even the incarceration portion of a split sentence ( the three - year minimum ) may be suspended			2
so 20 years can mean zero years			0
why give so much discretion to judges ? in @entity2 , the rules of procedure direct judges to consider alternatives to long prison terms			1
why ? the rules cite skyrocketing costs associated with actual confinement and call attention to prison overcrowding			1
that prison overcrowding leads to uncertainty : in other words , the judges do n't know that the prison can even accommodate their sentence , so they might as well mete out a sentence that can actually be carried out			1
an illegal sentence vs. an immoral sentence for many , it does n't matter that this might have been a legal sentence			1
the outrage is directed not at the legality , but the morality of the punishment			0
did the judge have a moral obligation to incarcerate @entity11 ? what would you have done ? would you have given credence to the defense 's argument that the sex was consensual ? is it more important to you as a judge that @entity11 get the counseling that sex offenders desperately need ? or is it more important that he be isolated from society ? the idea of punishment for criminals is justified by a few different goals			1
incarceration serves to quarantine criminals and protect the rest of us in society from them			0
another goal of punishment is rehabilitation			0
like it or not , most sex offenders will eventually serve their sentences and be back on the street			0
given the risk of repeat offenses , rehabilitation of these felons could be the most critical factor in protecting society			0
but punishment also recognizes simple retribution as a goal			0
retribution is the idea that a punishment should , in theory , be equivalent to the crime			0
while retribution can also achieve vengeance , it serves a more practical purpose			0
a society that fails to punish offenders risks citizens taking matters into their own hands -- which threatens the stability of the society itself			0
so , if you are a retribution - type judge , you 'd probably sentence @entity11 to long - term incarceration -- even though the legislature has effectively told you that , because of overcrowding , he might not serve that whole sentence			1
if you are a rehabilitation - type judge , or you worry about @entity11 's dependents , you might do as this judge did , and focus on the rehabilitation , with the idea that more progress can be made on the outside than on the inside			2
as long as the sentence is legal , as a judge , the choice is yours : do you focus on retribution ? or rehabilitation ? one thing is for certain , you may not agree with the judge 's sentence in the @entity11 case			1
indeed , the prosecution in this case is not going gently into the good night			0
the prosecution has now asked an appeals court to fix what it calls an illegal sentence , claiming the judge had no authority to impose the two - year minimum , and should have at least imposed the three year minimum			1
that appears to be a correct reading of the law			2
of course , if the judge can suspend the entire sentence anyway , including the mandatory minimum , is it a distinction without a difference ? the prosecution also claims that felons convicted of first - degree rape are excluded by law from community - based programs , because rape is so fundamentally a crime of violence			1
if the judge misread the law here , the prosecution may succeed			1
if so , the court will have to resentence @entity11 -- but if the judge can still suspend the entire sentence , could @entity11 get an even better deal ? if you ca n't accept it , then your beef is not only with the judge			1
your beef is with the @entity2 legislature and the @entity2 courts that enacted not only the rules , but warned the justice system that it simply could not accommodate prison terms			1
your beef is with the same prisons that do n't have enough beds , leading to the crisis			0
finally , your beef is with the @entity120 , which sanctioned this practice			0
because even if this sentence is ultimately legal , you may still conclude that it is an immoral one			2
unfortunately , there 's no appeals court for that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			2

an @entity2 man was sentenced to no prison time for rape conviction
@entity278 says @entity2 law , rules give judges discretion to suspend prison terms
he says even if the sentence is legal , it may not be a moral one
@entity278 : people who object should blame legislature and courts , in *addition* to judge
