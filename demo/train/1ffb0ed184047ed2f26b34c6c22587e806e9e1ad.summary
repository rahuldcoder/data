while it 's a form of transport few of us see , shipping packs a punch as a polluter			1
according to a recent study , shipping accounts for around 3 % of global co2 emissions			1
not surprising when you consider that the engines of the world 's estimated 90,000 cargo ships are in use 24 hours a day while traveling			1
futuristic concepts for container ships powered by alternative energy range from windmill - powered propellers to banks of vertical metal sails			1
even though most are still on the drawing board , one concept is starting to be viewed seriously by the shipping industry			0
airfoil design called the " @entity26 , " the @entity25 design uses the high sides of its container ships as sails , turning the whole vessel into a wind - assisted airfoil			1
designed by @entity32 , the @entity34 - based company says the hybrid merchant ship -- which would still have a liquefied natural gas - powered engine -- could achieve fuel savings of 60 % and reduce emissions by 80 %			1
it 's the brainchild of @entity41 , who used his skills as a speed sailor to develop his aerodynamic design			1
he says the futuristic container ship works more like an airplane than a conventional sailing ship			1
he said : " in the era of @entity51 , for example , he would have used what became known as trade winds but his ship was quite different from the @entity55 because he would have been sailing with the wind -- he could n't sail into the wind			1
" @entity58 can almost sail into the wind ; in this way it 's more like an airplane			1
" it uses apparent wind , or the sail wind , to generate pull in much the same way that an airplane will take off when it reaches a certain speed			0
" the ship would be able to point as high as 18 degrees into the wind , the vacuum created on the lee side of the vessel ( the side sheltered from the wind ) enough to propel the ship forward			1
computers critical critical to the design is computer software being developed by @entity78 's @entity77 , which calculates the optimal sailing route based on the weather and prevailing winds			1
" with this software , you input when you want to leave and when you want to arrive , the weather forecast is loaded into the program and then it calculates the best route , " @entity41 said			0
" this would be dynamically updated every day			0
at each waypoint it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down ; it makes it very easy for the crew			0
" the algorithms in the software also calculate the best angle to the wind to gain the maximum performance from the design			2
" with our weather routing module the best route can be calculated in order to consume as little fuel as possible			2
as a result costs are reduced			2
after all , bunker ( ship fuel oil ) expenses account for the largest part of the total costs in the shipping industry , " said @entity107 , researcher at @entity108 in @entity109			1
sulfur -- the game changer changes to regulations in the sulfur content of marine heavy fuels are set to make the price of bunker fuel -- typically among the heaviest and dirtiest of fuels in the distillation process -- more expensive			2
shippers traditionally favored polluting residual bunker fuels because they were cheap , with large ships having the space to transport the pre-heaters necessary to make the fuel volatile			2
but all that is about to change			0
current international regulations cap sulfur content at 3.5 % but this is expected to drop to 0.5 % by 2020			2
" this makes things quite dramatic , " said @entity41			0
" there are not many good solutions to this			0
at the moment they can wash the exhaust with scrubbers but on big ships this is very complex and very expensive			0
" this is where the ' @entity147 ' comes in -- due to the low fuel consumption it can run on lng which means there is no sulfur at all			2
" one of @entity25 's biggest shipowners , @entity155 , has already entered the project on a technical basis and , while @entity41 is quietly confident the world 's first @entity26 will slip into the water by 2019 , he says the global shipping industry had been slow to respond to his design			1
" ( but ) the big driving force in the @entity147 project will be these new regulations on sulfur levels , " @entity41 said			0
" the big problem with sulfur is that it acidifies the sea and this means that shrimps and crabs ca n't form their shells , " said @entity41 , adding that acidification was impacting the entire marine ecosystem			0
" it 's very bad			2
something has to be done -- it ca n't go on this way			0
" the @entity180 shipping line @entity178 told @entity1 that it was pursuing innovations in energy efficiency as a solution in the " here and now			0
" " in general , we do not believe that wind - assisted designs will play any significant role within the container shipping industry in the foreseeable future , " said @entity178 head of sustainability @entity185			0
" the technology remains unproven at both commercial and operational scale			0
" she said that @entity178 was developing its @entity197 vessels which used ultra-long stroke engines , efficient vessel shape and advanced waste heat recovery systems to improve @entity202 efficiency by 50 % per container			1
" if you look at the technology already on - board our vessels today , it 's remarkable just how far we 've come , " she said .			0

a @entity25 design would use the high sides of a cargo ship as sails
the designers say it could save as much as 60 % on fuel costs , 80 % on @entity202 emissions
the world 's first @entity219 could slip into the water by 2019
