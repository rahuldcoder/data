-- this week , @entity1 named @entity2 a finalist for @entity4 , the annual award bestowed on the person editors think has " most affected the news and our lives , for good or ill , and embodied what was important about the year			1
" a true testament to the global influence of twerking , she was the only nominee from the entertainment industry			0
her co-nominees included @entity18 president @entity17 , president @entity19 , @entity20 , and gay rights activist @entity21			0
the pope was the winner , but one thing 's for certain : @entity2 makes an impact			1
regardless of whether you care about her latest performance or haircut or provocative , eyebrow - raising declaration to the press , it 's likely you 'll have heard about it			0
in part , that 's owing to her affinity for ever - media - friendly shock , delivered in the form of a raunchy , nudity - filled music video ; a raunchy , nudity - filled photo shoot with photographer @entity42 ; and a raunchy awards show performance that likely would have contained some nudity had it been allowed			1
it did , however , contain a foam finger and a latex bodysuit			0
and a tongue that was a performer of its own			0
shocking behavior is n't uncommon in the entertainment industry , and especially in music			0
@entity55 , like sex , sells			0
but it 's quite possible @entity2 is n't selling just shock , and albums			1
she 's also selling drugs			0
earlier this year , @entity2 ended months of speculation that one of her song lyrics referred to " @entity64 , " the nickname for psychedelic drug @entity64 , or a form of @entity64			1
when she was asked if she was referring to her own name or the drug @entity64 in the song " @entity71 , " she told @entity72 , " if you 're aged 10 , it 's ' @entity2			1
' if you know what i 'm talking about , then you know			0
" in september , she offered a second endorsement , telling @entity77 that marijuana and @entity64 are " happy drugs -- social drugs			2
they make you want to be with friends			0
" what effect might the former @entity85 star 's drug advocacy have on the legions of tween and teen fans who follow her every move ? a 2008 study looking at the influence of technology , media and pop culture on criminal behavior concluded that while young people are influenced by pop culture , and more so than adults , it was difficult to empirically study the cause and effect of pop culture on their behavior			1
and certainly , the glorification of vice in music is not at the hands of @entity2 alone : a 2008 study out of the @entity111 and published in the @entity112 found that 33 % of the top 300 songs on the top of the billboard charts portrayed drug or alcohol use -- an increasing number of them pop songs -- which means that kids receive about 35 references to substance abuse for every hour of music they listen to			1
that said , what we do know : exposure to excessive violence in video games can increase aggressive attitudes , behaviors and values , particularly in children			0
and adolescent exposure to music , a powerful social force often linked to identity , memories and mood , is much more frequent than it is to any other form of pop culture			1
according to the @entity145 study , most teens listen to an average of 16 hours each week of music , compared with about six hours each week for movies			0
perhaps more than any other entertainment medium , the study authors wrote , " music is well known to connect deeply with adolescents and to influence identity development			0
" and so it 's hard not to argue that @entity64 is likely reaping the benefits			2
the numbers are there : a 2010 @entity158 on @entity159 and @entity160 found that 12.4 % of @entity161 between 18 and 25 had experimented with @entity64 , while a report released last week by the @entity161 @entity163 stated that emergency room visits related to @entity64 increased 128 % between 2005 and 2011 among people younger than 21			1
" everyone wants to try it , " a recent @entity167 article quoted a 19 - year - old named @entity168 as saying , and indeed many are : in recent months , there were multiple suspected mdma - related deaths and hospitalizations reported along the @entity175 , and in october , @entity64 was linked to 10 @entity177 - area deaths			1
music might not make kids do drugs			0
but it 's @entity182 ve to think that music is n't having an impact on kids ' behavior and perception -- and that all this attention @entity2 is getting is n't teaching them something about what it takes to get noticed			1
( meanwhile , all the attention @entity64 is getting will , naturally , serve to pique curiosity			2
) @entity2 is an adult			2
she can sing about and ingest whatever she wants -- but naming her a @entity4 ? well , it 's a tough pill to swallow			2
unless , of course , you 're a drug named @entity64			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity204 : that @entity2 was a finalist for @entity4 shows her impact
@entity204 : she *confirms* the " @entity64 " she sings of in " @entity71 " is a form of drug mdma
@entity204 : who knows if her fans will be likely to try it , but music is a powerful force
she says @entity64 - related er visits and reports of young people dying from it are up
