@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity0 governor 's race , billed as the marquee battle of an otherwise anticlimactic 2013 election cycle , is shaping up to be a foregone conclusion			1
democrat @entity8 , the longtime political fixer and moneyman , has n't trailed in a poll since may			0
barring a political miracle , @entity13 @entity12 will be delivering a concession speech on tuesday evening in @entity1			2
in recent cycles , the @entity0 race has been a key off - year barometer of national political sentiment			2
four years ago , @entity13 @entity20 won in blowout fashion , a victory that presaged the following year 's @entity13 midterm wave			2
in 2005 , democrat @entity24 captured the governor 's mansion , tapping into anxiety about president @entity29 's handling of the @entity30 and @entity31			1
the @entity8 - @entity12 race has been defined by small - bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns			1
but despite the lack of late fireworks , there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the @entity0 campaign			2
here 's what you need to know about this year 's most important race : 1			2
the 2012 playbook is still potent for democrats @entity8 is n't exactly squeaky - clean			0
a longtime wheeler - dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns , " the @entity55 " has a history of eyebrow - raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder			0
the opposition research book on the former @entity58 chairman is as thick a @entity0 live oak			2
but @entity47 have successfully turned the race into a referendum on @entity12 , defining him over the summer as a right - wing zealot			1
a @entity65 poll last week showed that two - thirds of @entity8 supporters said they were voting against @entity12 , rather than for @entity8			0
how did the @entity47 do it ? with a relentless focus on @entity12 's conservative record on women 's health issues , a playbook that president @entity74 's campaign employed to great effect in 2012 against @entity13 nominee @entity76			1
and @entity76 was never as conservative as @entity12			2
@entity74 campaigns for @entity8 in @entity0 " it is impossible to be the candidate of the tea party and still be the candidate of the center , " argued @entity8 's pollster , @entity77			2
in tv ad after tv ad , voters in this swing state were told of @entity12 's record on abortion , contraception and domestic violence			1
some of the claims were stretches maybe , but welcome to politics			0
at the same time , @entity8 " seized the center , " his campaign aides say , drawing some business - friendly @entity13 politicians and a few @entity13 donors to his side			0
the message from @entity13 has been muddy			0
one week , they were hitting @entity8 over a sputtering car company he founded , and the next they were calling attention to his attempts to expand a business venture in @entity105			0
thoughout the race , @entity12 's campaign has called @entity8 " deeply unserious " -- even running a memorable ad with a clip of @entity8 downing a shot of rum on live television -- but none of the attacks seemed to stick			1
the unwavering @entity58 assault has worked			0
@entity76 lost the state last year while losing women by 9 points			0
the gender gap is much worse for @entity12			0
in some polls , @entity12 trails @entity8 among women by more than 20 points			2
that 's a huge problem in a state where more than half of voters in 2012 were women , many of them from the moderate @entity130 suburbs			0
democrats are outspending republicans it does n't happen often in campaigns , but @entity47 have already won the money war in @entity0			1
it helps that @entity8 is one of the @entity47 's most prolific fundraisers , running in a state with porous campaign finance laws			1
he 's collected more than $ 34 million this cycle , tapping a deep donor rolodex dating back to the @entity142 years that includes media executive @entity144 , @entity146 business maven @entity145 and @entity148 golden boy @entity147			0
labor unions have also been generous contributors			0
@entity12 has collected much less this year , nearly $ 20 million			0
one reason for the smaller haul : a number of reliable @entity13 donors , anxious about @entity12 's social agenda , have held back their support			1
some have even raised money for @entity8 , including the @entity0 homebuilder @entity159 , a former @entity160 finance chairman who supported @entity20 during his 2009 campaign			2
the same tale is true with outside groups			0
@entity165 outfits such as the @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 have ponied up big for @entity8 , while their counterparts on the right have been far less generous			0
@entity47 have vastly outspent @entity13 on the television airwaves			0
last week , @entity8 and his @entity58 allies outspent @entity12 and @entity13 on tv by a four to one margin , according to a @entity175 familiar with ad spending in the race			2
@entity12 has relied on the backing of the @entity179 , one of the country 's better - funded campaign committees , but its @entity58 counterparts managed to keep pace			1
the @entity179 spent $ 8 million on the race , while the @entity186 put in $ 6.5 million , lending a crucial lifeline to the @entity8 campaign earlier this year when their cash flow was n't as hot			0
@entity12 is betting on conservative turnout the @entity12 campaign 's slogan in the final weeks of the race might as well be " independents be damned			1
" trailing @entity8 among independent voters by a 15 - point margin , and doing even worse with women voters , @entity12 has spent the fall trying to stir the passions of the @entity13 base in hopes that fired - up conservatives could make up the difference a low turnout , nonpresidential election in which @entity47 stay home			1
in the closing days , @entity12 is trying to turn the race into a referendum on the @entity209 , a still - controversial law that 's suffering from enrollment problems			1
but he 's been trying to rally the right for weeks , giving interviews to conservative media outlets and bringing in an all - star team of @entity13 surrogates to join him on the campaign trail			2
among the team players who 've made the trip to @entity219 : former @entity221 gov. @entity220 , @entity223 gov. @entity222 , @entity225 sen. @entity224 , @entity227 gov. @entity226 , @entity229 gov. @entity228 and @entity231 sen. @entity230			0
@entity12 is also trying to bring libertarian voters back into the fold by campaigning with former @entity235 rep. @entity234 on monday			2
a libertarian candidate , @entity236 , has performed surprisingly well in the polls , and it 's hurting @entity12 , whose crusading social conservative views do n't exactly square with the limited - government crowd			1
polls show @entity13 slightly less supportive of @entity12 than @entity47 are of @entity8			1
@entity12 's closing strategy is a fitting one			1
he captured the @entity13 nomination at a party convention in may , nominated by a small batch of the party 's most hard - core conservative activists			0
now he 's counting on them to finish what they started			0
the real action is down - ballot with @entity47 bullish on their chances at winning the governorship and the lieutenant governor 's race -- in which @entity13 nominated a long - shot candidate , the fiery former pastor @entity254 -- close watchers of the campaign are eyeing the attorney general 's race , shaping up to be tuesday 's only real toss - up			1
@entity47 have n't swept all three statewide offices in @entity0 since 1989 , when @entity267 became the nation 's first @entity270 - @entity269 governor			1
it could happen again this year			0
the ag race is a dogfight between two state senators , democrat @entity276 and @entity13 @entity277 , and outside groups have started to inject serious money into the campaign			0
in some ways , it 's a proxy war between the @entity283 and @entity285 's anti-gun mayor , @entity284			0
the @entity283 has funded a tv ad blitz accusing @entity276 of wanting to curtail gun rights , while a @entity289 - backed super pac , @entity288 , has come to @entity276 's defense with a $ 1 million ad campaign painting @entity277 as a conservative extremist			2
on the @entity13 side , the @entity295 has pumped nearly $ 2 million into @entity277 's coffers			0
and the @entity47 of @entity0 , content with the state of play in the governor 's race , has spent the final week of the race turning its guns on @entity277 in an effort highlight his conservative voting record in @entity1			1
it 's the @entity307 ' gateway back into politics for almost two decades , @entity8 has been one of @entity142 's dearest friends and most trusted advisers			1
the former president campaigned for @entity8 in 2009 , when he made an unsuccessful bid for the governor 's mansion , so it 's no surprise that he got involved again in 2013 , hitting every corner of the commonwealth last week in a nine - city swing that drew enthusiastic crowds and generated boatloads of earned media			1
and @entity142 was n't shy about using the perch to point out a few of his accomplishments in the @entity326			0
@entity142 cavalry rides into @entity0 but it 's not just @entity329 : with @entity8 looking sturdy in the polls down the stretch , the campaign provided @entity333 with a low - risk way to ease back into campaign politics after spending the previous four years traveling the globe as secretary of state			1
with a possible 2016 presidential bid on the horizon , she made her first overtly political speech at a @entity8 rally two weeks , drawing almost 600 people , many of them women , to a theater in northern @entity0			1
her speech was vintage @entity333 , more prose than poetry , but the appearance gave her a chance to get in front of a partisan crowd and test drive some potential campaign themes of her own			1
the @entity307 have also used the @entity0 race to get back in the fundraising game , hosting a number of closed - door finance events for @entity8 and burnishing their relationships with the @entity58 donor class in the process .			1

@entity47 made @entity12 's conservative views on women 's issues a focus
@entity0 governor 's race is rare one in which @entity47 are outspending republicans
@entity12 campaign hoping it can mobilize enough of its base to save victory
governor 's race gave @entity329 and @entity333 a gateway back into campaign politics
