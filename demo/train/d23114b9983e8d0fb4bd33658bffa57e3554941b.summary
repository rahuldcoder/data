-- he 's won six @entity3 medals on two legs , but @entity6 's future will ride on four			1
one of the finest skiers of all time , the @entity8 's obsessive attention to detail has paid dividends during his mercurial career on the slopes			1
now , as the 37 - year - old enters the autumn of his alpine skiing days , @entity6 hopes to transfer his meticulous approach to training racehorses			1
he is convinced that technology is key to equine success , and he aims to take his flair for innovation from the piste to the racetrack			0
" i 'm one of the people who sees it really clearly because i 'm in a different sport that uses all that stuff , " @entity6 told @entity0 at last weekend 's @entity27 ski opener in @entity28 , @entity29			1
" the people in horse racing do n't see it at all			1
they think it 's crazy , they think it 's like voodoo and magic , and for us it 's just normal stuff			0
" in @entity6 's experience , success can be achieved by the smallest of margins			1
winless for two years and dogged by injury , it was a heart - in - mouth moment when he roared down the mountain at february 's @entity50 in a final attempt to add to his @entity3 medal tally			2
" i 've always been very scientific in my approach -- in @entity58 i changed from using a rubber goggle strap to a plastic strap because research showed it would save me one - hundredth of a second , " he explained at the premier of a new documentary " @entity54 , " about life after skiing			1
" i took bronze by one - hundredth of a second ! " @entity6 's " leave - no - stone - unturned " attitude has served him well			1
he was famously one of the first athletes to break away from the @entity8 ski team -- and be successful			2
in addition to his @entity3 haul , @entity6 boasts five world championship medals , 33 @entity27 victories and two overall titles to boot			2
and , although he enters horse racing as something of a novice , @entity6 is confident that a modern approach could reap rich rewards			1
" twenty - five years ago , ski racing equipment was archaic			1
i came in and said , ' let 's build shape skis ' and a bunch of other changes , and the sport changed really dramatically and allowed me to be on the front end of it for a long time , " he says			0
" twenty years ago horse racing was the same , but now it 's in a perfect place where sport and technology can be put together			1
it 's all invented already , but you just have to apply it in the right way			0
" it 's not the first time @entity6 's attention has been drawn away from ski racing			1
in 2010 , following an invitation from the @entity103 , @entity6 tried and failed to qualify for the @entity104 , losing his opening match at the sectional playoffs			2
but his passion for flat racing has been bubbling under the surface for some time			1
ever since becoming a small - portion owner in a racehorse 10 years ago , @entity6 has slowly developed his knowledge and expertise to the level that he can now realize his ambition of a full - time career in the sport			1
and it 's clear the high - stakes nature of racing appeals to his basic instincts			2
" the horses perform at their highest level -- they 're trying with everything they have , " @entity6 says			2
" i think coming from ski racing i can appreciate that			0
losing by just a nose , or a whisker , " he smiles , " it 's tough			0
" as with everything @entity6 commits himself to , only " the best " will do			2
" it really has a lot of the critical components of things that i love in my life , " he continues			0
" to set that on top of the challenge of figuring out an industry and becoming the best in the world at something ... it 's just the icing on the cake			0
" but this time he wo n't be going it alone			0
helping him out of the starting gate is one of the best trainers in the business , @entity152 , who appears to provide the " @entity155 " to @entity6 's " @entity154			1
" " for me he 's a great example of how to balance out expert horsemanship -- which he has -- with sports science and technology , which is what i have , " @entity6 says of his new partner			2
and with three @entity163 wins under his belt , @entity152 also brings a wealth of knowledge of what it takes to win @entity8 's preeminent flat racing event -- a long - held ambition for @entity6			1
" when people talk about a horse race , that 's the one they talk about , " he says			0
" it 's the biggest showpiece , it has the same prestige in the sport the same way @entity178 does in ski racing			0
it 's a very challenging race to win			0
" so what of his skiing career ? @entity6 fueled speculation that he would compete at the @entity184 in @entity185 after signing a four - year contract with helmet manufacturer @entity187			1
but he was quick to dismiss the rumor on @entity189 , citing his already advanced years for a top skier			2
at this stage of the game , health has become a real consideration for @entity6			0
on sunday he withdrew from the 2014 - 15 season 's first @entity27 event in @entity28 with an ongoing back injury -- a sign that he 's no longer willing to put his body on the line			0
" if it was golf then , you know , maybe i could lag on for another couple of years and keep competing because there 's no real harm in it , " he admits			0
" in skiing , if you make the wrong mistake or you 're not fully prepared , you can kill yourself			0
" if i 'm not in peak form or putting in all the work you need to be prepared and safe , then i 'll pull away from the sport			0
" the high - octane world of flat racing holds no such risks for @entity6 , only tantalizing rewards			1
and as he moves into his twilight years on the snow , this workhorse has a feeling the turf will suit him just fine			1
" i can stay focused on something indefinitely for as long as it needs to happen , and i love that horses are the same way , " he says			0
" when you put a horse to task they do what you ask them to every time , so building a scenario which helps them to peak at the right time is really appealing to me			0
it 's exactly what we do in ski racing			0
