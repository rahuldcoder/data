@entity1 group employs 2,700 people and has operations in nine countries , including the @entity2 , @entity47 , the @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
while it produces products such as low - sodium food dressings and baking sprays , the acquisition is most significant for adding further weight to @entity0 's operations in so - called " personal care " products such as skincare , haircare and bodywash			1
personal care is the fastest - growing category for global consumer goods companies , especially in emerging markets , and the @entity1 acquisition will allow @entity0 to have more products across a broader range of price points			1

the story is the same at @entity81 , the maker of @entity83 cleaner and finish dishwasher powder , where health and personal care is growing at 14 percent a year , compared to 8 percent growth across the whole business			0
the drive to access this fast - growing category prompted @entity81 to purchase @entity91 , the maker of @entity93 condoms and @entity95 footcare , in july for £ 1.5bn ( $ 2.3bn )			2
the @entity1 acquisition is the second major deal by @entity0 in this product category this year			2
in september 2009 , the group bought the personal care division of @entity100 , securing @entity102 bubblebath and @entity103 , although the @entity104 is still scrutinizing the deal			0
" personal care is a strategic category for @entity0 and growing rapidly , " said mr @entity12			0
" ten years ago it represented 20 percent of our turnover ; strong organic growth has now driven it to reach over 30 percent , with strong positions in many of the emerging markets			0
" organic growth remains the cornerstone of our energizing ambition to double the size of @entity0 whilst reducing our overall environmental impact			0
@entity119 - on acquisitions such as @entity1 supplement organic growth and add powerful new brands to our portfolio			2
" initial analyst response to the acquisition was positive			0
" the initial consideration for @entity1 of @entity131 on the face of it looks quite punchy , but we believe ' significant ' but as yet undisclosed synergies will make the price look more reasonable , " said @entity125 and @entity126 at @entity127 in a note to investors			0
" it further skews @entity0 to high - growth , high - margin personal care categories , gives a more rounded category presence in hair care and makes it global leader in hair conditioning , number two in shampoo and number three in styling			0
