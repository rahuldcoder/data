@entity1 , @entity0 -- if climate change were a small house fire , current policy in the @entity6 and the @entity7 would ensure that it would destroy not just the house but the entire suburb			1
author of " @entity11 " compares global warming to a house fire that the world is currently failing to contain			1
that 's the grim analogy offered by @entity16 , author of a new report , " @entity11 : blue sky thinking for a green future " , by the @entity20 , a @entity1 - based pan-european think tank			1
the report explores three scenarios on climate change , none of which leads to what 's defined by the @entity6 and @entity7 as a ' successful outcome ' ; a greater than 90 percent chance of temperatures rising by no more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels			1
" we have failed , " @entity16 says , adding , " we will not prevent two degrees of warming			1
" continuing the house fire analogy he says , " the less than two degree scenario is a fire you can put out			0
with less than three degrees it spreads to other rooms but you can still put it out			1
" he says global policy of the past ten years looks more like the third -- and worst -- scenario explored by the @entity11 report -- the one dubbed " agree and @entity45			1
" in that case , " your house is unrecognizably destroyed			0
the positive feedback cycle is n't contained			0
your house catches fire , your neighbor 's catches fire ... " and so on			2
@entity16 blames the failure of the current climate change policy on the constant stream of compromises by world leaders designed to keep the @entity59 agreement intact			2
" this dynamic of making lots of small compromises in order to keep the agreement in place has led to a situation where the agreement has lost a lot of its teeth			0
" he points to @entity71 as an example , a signatory to the @entity59 agreement which has " done nothing " to implement it			0
" during the time it 's been a signatory it 's been developing massive coal sands projects which are the most polluting way of producing gas and oil in the world , " he says			2
" there 's a great international censure against the @entity84 for not ratifying @entity59 but nothing has been said about @entity71			2
" " the coal sands are using so much natural gas and electricity they could have an entire nuclear facility just for themselves			0
" the three alternative futures explored in the @entity11 report include " @entity93 , " " agree and ignore " and " @entity94			1
" " @entity93 " envisages a gradual transition to a global cap on carbon emissions by 2012			1
@entity16 calls it a " largely successful scenario " where there 's a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising more than 3.31 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100			1
" that 's not a disaster			2
it 's still a world that 's recognizable , " he says			2
the second scenario -- " agree and ignore " -- predicts efforts to reduce carbon emissions will " stall and backslide " leading to " competitive regionalism			2
" there would be a greater than 90 percent chance of global average temperatures rising no more than 4.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100			1
from that point , temperatures would continue to rise into the next century			0
the third scenario -- " @entity94 " -- imagines a radical shift in global policy direction			1
world leaders would introduce a system of global carbon caps , giving them greater than 90 percent chance of limiting the rise in global average temperatures to 2.85 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100			1
of the three scenarios , " @entity127 " is the one @entity16 personally prefers but the one he concedes is unlikely to happen			2
" our proposal [ for a global upstream cap ] is similar to but not identical to the proposal from the @entity59 2 project , " he says			0
" it 's a line of thinking that 's been around for a while that will provide a healthy alternative to emissions trading			0
" under the scheme , the @entity138 would impose an annual cap on the amount of carbon that could be produced from fossil fuels			0
natural resource companies would have to apply and pay for permits to produce carbon			1
compliance would be determined at key points , for example , coal washing stations			0
" the problem is how do you get the political impetus to have a big international change like that and for people to accept that this is genuinely going to be dealt with at an international level , " @entity16 asks			0
the " @entity94 " scenario supposes that the impetus comes through a threat to @entity84 and @entity163 economic security			0
under the scenario , climate change threatens @entity163 - @entity84			0
trade relations so the two combine to lead and enforce global change			0
" our current approach to climate change is moving at the pace of the slowest country , " @entity16 says , adding , " here they say we 're going to move as quickly as possible and then force others to catch up			0
" under that scenario , the need to purchase carbon production permits would push record oil prices even higher as energy companies pass on the cost to consumers			1
@entity16 is confident the global economy could cope -- it 's adapted to higher energy prices so far and is likely to prove equally resilient in the future			1
and the extra cost of fuel , rather going to producers , would be held in a fund controlled by the @entity138			0
it would be used to help developing nations to use fewer fossil fuels , to support new research and development , to compensate oil producers for the carbon they 're not producing , and to establish an emergency fund to deal with the consequences of climate change			0
@entity16 acknowledges that world leaders are unlikely to use the report as the basis for a new global policy , but he hopes they at least take away two key points : " whenever possible regulate at the point where there are fewest participants [ and ] we need to make sure there 's a clear price signal so the market can distribute energy efficiently			1

@entity11 report says @entity6 , @entity7 global warming targets " unrealistic "
report 's author : " we have failed . we will not prevent two degrees of warming "
