-- @entity1 is facing pressure to return money it accepted to run ads promoting its page for @entity10 president @entity9 's presidential campaign			1
the social media network has pulled the ads , which directed users to the campaign page , but it has refused to say whether it will return the money it took in exchange for them			0
" by accepting money for ' promoted posts , ' @entity1 has provided a platform for the propaganda of a regime that has been at the heart of one of the world 's most brutal conflicts , " @entity20 of @entity21 said monday			1
the group has created an online petition , multiple @entity34 videos and launched website called @entity36 calling on @entity1 to return the money and take down the @entity9 campaign page			1
launched in may , the @entity1 page is called " @entity41 " ( @entity41 means " together " ) and has more than 230,000 likes			0
it is regularly updated with photos from the @entity9 campaign , including pictures of @entity9 and his wife , @entity46 , going to a polling station to vote tuesday			0
polls for the @entity10 presidential election opened against the backdrop of a bloody and protracted civil war , and @entity9 is almost guaranteed to emerge victorious in a vote that opposition groups and many @entity55 countries say has been be rigged from the start			2
" we have looked onto this thoroughly , including reviewing ip address and payment information , and we have no evidence that these ads were ordered from @entity10 , " a @entity1 representative said			2
an ip address indicates an internet user 's location , though users can easily mask real ip addresses to make it appear they 're in another country			0
" we comply with all relevant @entity10 sanctions and we do not permit ads originating from or targeting @entity10 , " the @entity1 representative added			1
even though it removed the ads promoting the page , @entity1 says it is not considering taking down the @entity9 campaign page			1
" you 'll find a range of voices debating events in @entity10 on @entity1 , " according to the @entity1 representative			0
users do n't have to pay to open an account on social media , so the social network typically allows political leaders and heads of state to maintain a presence on its platforms , regardless of their standing			2
social media networks often prefer not to decide which leaders deserve and do n't deserve the ability to have a presence on their sites			0
the campaign to reelect @entity9 has maintained an active presence on @entity1 and other social media with additional accounts on @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity34 , which are all regularly updated .			1
