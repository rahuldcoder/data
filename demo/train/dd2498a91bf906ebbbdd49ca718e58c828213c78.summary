@entity0 -- a @entity3 company is seeking to buy a controlling interest in one of the largest uranium extraction operations in the @entity7 -- a sale that requires @entity7 government review because of possible national security implications			1
@entity11 , now a subsidiary of a @entity14 company , operates a uranium processing facility in @entity16 and has assets in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
the sale of the company 's existing and pending operations could give @entity3 control of about 20 percent of @entity7 uranium extraction capacity , @entity22 officials estimate			1
industry observers tell @entity1 they do not believe the sale of @entity11 to @entity30 , or @entity31 , would jeopardize @entity7 security , saying that the @entity7 relies on @entity3 dismantled nuclear weapons for much of the uranium used in nuclear reactors today , and that sources of uranium are plentiful			1
" i have no concerns about it at all , " said @entity38 , former director of the @entity40 's @entity39			0
" i do n't see any national security threat to the @entity7 from the @entity3 partly or entirely owning a mine in the @entity7			1
" he added , " the @entity3 's are n't coming			2
they are no longer the @entity47			0
i think it 's to our mutual interest that we cooperate with the @entity3			2
" said @entity51 of the @entity52 , " looking at the big picture here , i do n't really think this has major security implications			0
i 'd be interested in hearing arguments otherwise , but i just do n't see it			0
" in an application submitted to the @entity22 , @entity60 , which currently owns 23.1 percent of @entity11 's common stock , says it is seeking to buy a controlling 51 percent interest			1
the @entity3 company is controlled by @entity65 , the @entity3 government agency that oversees @entity3 's nuclear industry			1
uranium one would continue to be publicly traded on the @entity70 , its @entity7 facilities would remain under their current management teams and five of the nine directors on the company 's board would be @entity76 , the company said			1
" the bottom line is any of the uranium we buy or sell has to be used for peaceful purposes and it 's subject to all the safeguards of the @entity84 , the @entity85 , @entity86 ( the @entity86 ) , or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction over the @entity7 " and customer countries , said @entity77 , spokesman for @entity11			1
uranium one @entity11 is involved in the " recovery " of uranium , a form of mining in which a solution is injected into an ore body and the uranium leaches into the solution , which is then extracted , said @entity22 spokesman @entity98			1
the company is licensed to produce up to 2.5 million pounds of uranium a year , it said			2
stockholders approved the sale august 31 , @entity77 said , but the companies are awaiting approval from numerous regulatory agencies in the @entity7 , @entity14 , @entity107 and @entity108			2
the @entity22 must approve the transfer of the @entity22 license for its @entity113 recovery facility in eastern @entity16 , @entity109 said			0
" generally , we look at whether the new ownership would have the technical expertise and the financial wherewithal to maintain the site and clean up when operations cease , " he said			0
further , the sale needs to be reviewed by the @entity122 in the @entity7 , an inter-agency panel that advises the president on any transaction that could jeopardize @entity7 national security			0
committee officials declined to discuss the sale , saying they are prohibited by law from disclosing such matters			0
and the sale may require approval of the @entity132 because it involves a stock transaction , and the @entity134 because one of the sites has a radio license , the @entity22 said			0
the @entity22 released details of a pending license transfer in the @entity140 , in an item giving the public an opportunity to request a hearing on the issue			0
the @entity22 involvement is limited to the company 's operations in @entity16			1
the states of @entity19 and @entity18 regulate uranium mining operations there .			0

the company is one of the largest uranium extraction operations in the @entity7
@entity22 : @entity3 would control about 20 percent of @entity7 uranium extraction capacity
former @entity7 *nonproliferation* official says he has " no concerns about it at all "
