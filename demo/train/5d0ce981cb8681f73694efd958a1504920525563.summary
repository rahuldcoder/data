eight weeks before the midterm elections , a new @entity2 / @entity1 poll shows that voters in key geographic regions favor @entity7 candidates heading into november , highlighting significant challenges for @entity9 trying to protect half a dozen vulnerable @entity11 seats and ultimately control of the chamber			1
equally concerning for @entity9 is that the @entity7 has a 15 - point advantage with independent voters on the generic ballot , and republicans have an edge at this point in supporter enthusiasm			2
while @entity7 are all but assured of maintaining a healthy majority in the @entity22 , the @entity7 needs a net gain of six seats to control the @entity11 and its committees that oversee the @entity27 administration			2
should the @entity7 control @entity29 next year , it would be positioned to direct the legislative agenda and influence president @entity27 's final two years in office			0
@entity32 : time for @entity27 to turn crisis into opportunity because of this , @entity9 are desperately trying to protect at least five incumbents in @entity37 or heavily rural states such as @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 as well as an open seat in @entity45			0
most of these races are considered tossups or the @entity7 has a slight advantage , according to state polling and analysis by independent political handicappers			0
meanwhile , there is widespread belief that three other open @entity9 seats in @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 have already been lost to @entity7 -- putting the @entity7 within striking distance of the net gain of six seats needed to take the @entity11 majority			1
lawmakers urge @entity27 to work with @entity64 on immigration assuming republicans maintain control of the @entity22 â€” @entity68 are split over which party should have control of the @entity11 with 46 % supporting a @entity9 majority and 42 % backing @entity7 control			1
it is a different story in the @entity57 where a majority of voters , 51 % , seek a @entity7 controlled @entity11 next year , perhaps making life difficult for @entity9 incumbents in @entity40 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
at the same time rural voters also want to see a @entity7 - controlled @entity11 by a 48 % -37 % margin that could have significant implications for @entity9 in @entity39 and @entity41			1
5 key midterm races to watch overall , @entity68 are angry with @entity29 , as a whole , with a whopping 83 % saying they disapprove of how @entity64 is handling its job , while 65 % describe it as the " worst @entity64 of their lifetime			1
" the current approval rating for @entity64 is 14 % , just four points higher than the all - time low of 10 % in a september 2013 @entity88			1
this might explain why voter enthusiasm has dropped off significantly since the last midterms in 2010 -- particularly among @entity7			2
four years ago , 53 % of @entity7 said they were enthusiastic or very enthusiastic about voting , that number has now dropped to 37 %			0
in 2010 , 30 % of @entity9 were enthusiastic about voting -- fast forward four years and that number has decreased two points			0
challenges to predicting the november election result despite the drop - off in voter enthusiasm from 2010 , the @entity7 has an advantage in this category , according to the poll			1
and other data points show that @entity27 will not be helpful to many of the endangered @entity9 seeking re-election			0
the @entity2 / @entity1 poll shows that 52 % of registered voters would support a candidate for @entity64 who opposes @entity27 , while 39 % would support a candidate that backs the president			2
@entity9 are hoping that candidates in @entity114 and @entity115 are able take back @entity7 held seats , which would help the task of keeping the @entity7 net gain under six seats a lot easier			0
as for the overall electoral mood for the @entity22 , the @entity7 holds a 49 % -45 % edge over @entity9 in the generic ballot question of which party would you vote for in your congressional district			0
@entity128 fears could help @entity7 in midterms			0

poll *reflects* significant challenges for @entity9 trying to keep @entity11 majority
65 % of poll *respondents* call the current @entity64 the worst in their lifetime
voter enthusiasm is down , which could be caused by *dissatisfaction* with @entity64
