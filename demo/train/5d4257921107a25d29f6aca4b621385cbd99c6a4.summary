@entity0 , @entity1 -- demonstrators rallied saturday in @entity1 's capital , demanding the @entity6 nation reform its rape laws following a teenage girl 's suicide after her father said a judge mandated that she marry her alleged rapist -- allowing him to stay out of jail			1
@entity14 , 16 , died suddenly last week in @entity15 , a city in northwestern @entity1 along the @entity17 coast			1
her father , @entity18 , told @entity2 that she was with her new husband when she " fell into street ( and ) started vomiting			0
" by the time an ambulance arrived , the father said , " it was already too late			0
" the girl died hours later at a @entity15 hospital			0
the state - run @entity28 news agency reported that @entity14 had committed suicide , the stark nature of her life and death spurring hundreds to turn out for saturday 's protest in front of the nation 's parliament			1
@entity18 told @entity1 newspaper @entity39 that his daughter had ingested rat poison , doing so after her husband had severely beaten her			2
police told @entity2 only that they were investigating the teenager 's death , but did n't provide further details			0
even so , the circumstances of her case have triggered outrage in @entity1 , especially from women 's rights advocates			2
" this girl was ( in essence ) raped twice , the last when she was married , " government spokesman @entity54 said thursday , referring to the initial reported rape and the fact she was forced to marry her alleged attacker			1
the girl 's father said he " did not want to accept this marriage , " which some have said was pushed in order to protect the family 's honor			2
but " my wife , my family and the court of the city of @entity15 " wanted the union to proceed , as it did			0
" the judge decided he must marry her , and i had no opportunity to refuse the judge 's decision , " the father said			2
" i wanted to send ( the eventual husband ) to prison , and have my daughter stay with me until she became ( an adult )			0
" under @entity1 law , rape is punishable by five to 10 years of prison , with a sentence as long as 20 years if the victim is a minor , pregnant or disabled			1
but if the victim and the rapist marry , the attacker is no longer liable			1
in this case , @entity14 's husband was never formally charged with rape due to the fact the family signed an agreement in court , according to the girl 's father			2
" through this law , the rape becomes legitimate , " said @entity98 , president of the @entity1 advocacy group the @entity99 for @entity100 , of the fact that an alleged rapist can avoid jail if he marries his victim			1
that fact has stirred anger and action in @entity1 , including saturday 's demonstration in @entity0 , which is about 170 kilometers ( 105 miles ) south of @entity15			1
protesters held up pictures of @entity14 , held up banners and chanted in @entity114 , " let 's ... end the marriage of minors			0
" @entity1 law defends " family morals , but does not take into account the right of women as a person , " @entity98 told @entity2			1
" the terrible story of @entity14 gives us more strength to move forward , " she added			0
@entity1 's government devoted much of its weekly meeting thursday to reviewing the case			1
" we need to study in - depth the situation with the possibility of increasing the penalties as part of a reform , " said @entity54 , the communications minister			0
" we can not ignore this tragedy			0
" @entity2 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
