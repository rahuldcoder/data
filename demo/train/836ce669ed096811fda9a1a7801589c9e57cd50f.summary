@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 , one of the last remaining lawmakers whose reelection fate has yet to be decided , has filed suit in federal court asking for 133 disqualified ballots to be counted as his contest with @entity10 @entity9 heads to a recount			1
" we are talking about 133 southern @entity16 voters who lived up to their responsibility â € ” they registered to vote and then showed up to vote , " @entity2 attorney @entity12 said in a statement out monday			1
" we are asking the court to ensure that every lawful vote is counted			2
that 's what @entity22 is all about			0
" @entity2 is trailing @entity9 , a retired @entity24 colonel , by just 161 votes , a margin slim enough to trigger a recount when the votes are certified by the secretary of state , which is expected dec. 1			1
but his campaign has been working feverishly over the past few weeks to find and gather evidence of ballots they say were illegitimately thrown out			0
they submitted with the lawsuit sworn affidavits from the voters in question outlining the issues they faced trying to cast their ballots			0
the reasons their votes were discarded range from signatures not lining up with their registrations to election officials failing to direct voters to their proper polling places			0
@entity2 's campaign tried unsuccessfully last week to delay the canvass of votes in the two counties that make up the district , @entity55 and @entity56 , hoping to buy time to continue to root out other votes that may have been wrongfully discarded			1
but with the campaign 's requests denied , @entity2 's options for ensuring those 133 ballots are included in the final count have narrowed			1
his lawsuit is seeking a restraining order to prevent the secretary of state from certifying the election results until the ballots in question have been counted			0
@entity2 holds the seat once held by his former boss @entity71 @entity71			2
@entity9 , meanwhile , is continuing with business as though representative - elect			2
she spent last week in @entity0 at freshman orientation with other newly elected lawmakers from across the nation .			0
