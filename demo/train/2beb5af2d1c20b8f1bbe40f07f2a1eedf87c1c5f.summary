-- auto - correct and " @entity1			0
" @entity2 , and those awkward texts from last night			0
mobile phones , and their promise of unprecedented connectivity , have altered the way we live			0
and it all started 40 years ago today			1
that 's when @entity11 , a vice president at @entity12 , stepped onto a @entity14 sidewalk and made the first known cellphone call in history			1
and , whether you thank him or blame him , we have n't stopped talking , texting and tweeting since			0
in the time since @entity11 brandished what would become the @entity22 phone , our mobiles have gone from now - laughably clunky bricks to sleek , stylized slivers of technology			1
now they 're becoming fashionably monstrous with phone - tablet hybrids like the @entity28			2
and , along the way , they 've changed everything			0
" we knew that someday everybody would have a ( cell ) phone , but it was hard to imagine that that would happen in my lifetime , " @entity11 said to @entity0 last year			1
" and now we 've got almost five billion phones in the world			0
" @entity11 and his team had been in a race with @entity43 's @entity42 to create a cellphone			1
they 'd worked for about three months on the model he walked outside with on april 3 , 1973			1
and that first call ? it was to @entity43 's @entity49 , who headed up @entity42			2
" i called and told him , ' @entity49 , i 'm calling you from a cellular phone , a real cellular phone , a handheld , portable , real cellular phone ' , " @entity11 recalled			1
and , as he recalls it , his rival was n't quite as talkative			2
" i do n't remember exactly what he said , but it was really quiet for a while , " he said			0
" my assumption was that he was grinding his teeth			0
he was very polite and ended the call			2
when asked about it , he says he has no recollection of this moment			0
" it would take 10 years for a version of that @entity22 ( @entity71 ) phone to hit the market , for a hefty $ 3,900			1
the kind of phone @entity75 wielded in " @entity77 , " it weighed 2.5 pounds and was about a foot tall			1
compare that to the @entity79 , which weighs in at under 4 ounces , is less than 5 inches from top to bottom and sells at prices starting at $ 199			2
not that @entity11 , now 84 , necessarily embraces every aspect of the latest advances in the field he helped create			1
" i must tell you as much as we were dreamers , we never imagined that all these things could be combined into one			0
and i 'm really not so sure that it 's a great thing , " he said			0
" phones have gotten so complicated , so hard to use , that you wonder if this is designed for real people or for engineers			0
" what @entity11 foresees for phones			1
