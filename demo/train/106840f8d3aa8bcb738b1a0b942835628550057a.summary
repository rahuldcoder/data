@entity0 -- the @entity2 has @entity3 , which roots out spies and terrorists in the @entity7			0
the @entity8 said one option would be for domestic intelligence to operate under the @entity11			1
@entity12 has @entity13 -- the @entity13			0
now @entity14 is asking : should the @entity15 have its own domestic intelligence agency ? on monday , at the request of @entity14 , the @entity8 outlined the pros and cons of establishing a domestic intelligence agency			1
it also discussed different ways to organize a new entity , either as part of an existing department or as a new agency			2
but there 's one thing you wo n't find in the report -- a recommendation on what to do			0
" we were not asked to make a recommendation , and this assessment does not do so , " the report says			0
instead , says @entity8 's @entity35 , the report provides a " framework " for policymakers to use when deciding whether and how to reorganize counter-intelligence efforts at home			2
@entity8 is a nonprofit think tank seeking to help improve policy and decision making through objective research and analysis			1
collecting intelligence domestically always has been a sensitive issue , at least partially because of episodic abuses by the government , notably against civil rights leaders , unions , antiwar organizations or even communists and hate groups			2
but the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks renewed calls for increased domestic intelligence to prevent future attacks			1
critics said that in the lead - up to the attacks , the @entity11 devalued counterterrorism agents and failed to heed signs that an attack was imminent			1
" if you did n't carry a gun , you did n't count so much , " @entity35 said			0
after the attacks , the @entity11 moved to transform its primary mission from law enforcement to counterterrorism intelligence and prevention			1
it now focuses on terrorism through its @entity71 and the @entity72			0
the @entity8 report focuses on two options to the current system			2
in one , a new agency would be created using intelligence agencies from the @entity11 , @entity78 and intelligence community			1
a second option is to create an " agency within an agency " in the @entity11 or @entity78			1
the first option would result in an organization with a clear , unambiguous mission , and might be able to draw on a more diverse recruitment pool , such as linguists and historians who are not normally attracted to law enforcement			2
on the flip side , such massive reorganizations typically involve political compromises that could affect its performance			0
the second option -- an " agency within an agency " -- could involve less short - term disruption , but could be hindered by a " lack of clarity of a single mission , " the report says			2
@entity8 also suggests a range of actions short of reorganization that could improve domestic intelligence gathering , such as increasing resources , improving leadership and changing bureaucratic cultures			1
the report does not assess the @entity11 's performance since 9/11 , @entity35 said , but he believes @entity14 should seek an independent assessment			1
a panel of experts that @entity8 convened guessed that the probability of a terrorist attack had decreased about one - third since the september 11 , 2001			1
but " they were not enthusiastic about alternatives " to current counterterrorism organizations			0
in a cautionary note , the report says that while public acceptance of domestic intelligence activities is imperative , public attitudes about what is considered acceptable " can both be fragile and shift significantly over time			0
" " public demand for domestic intelligence is driven by the perceived threat , and those perceptions can change much more rapidly than the threat itself , " the report says			0
for instance , immediately after the 9/11 attacks , 49 percent of people surveyed were worried " a great deal " about more attacks			0
two years later , that had dropped to 25 percent .			0
