picture a colossal empire of little houses stacked on top of each other			2
visualize them connected by staircases snaking under dangling wires , through corridors so dark even police were rumored to be afraid of them			0
now picture 33,000 people living there , within the space of one city block			1
that was @entity16 , once considered the densest settlement on earth			1
" a huge monstrosity of buildings " before it was demolished twenty years ago , photographer @entity21 spent years with collaborator @entity23 documenting this unique @entity25 phenomenon , and remembers being amazed when he first saw it			1
" it was a huge monstrosity of buildings , " recalls @entity21			1
" it did n't look like anything else			0
" after all , the @entity16 was a kind of historical accident			1
a former @entity35 fortress , it never fully came under the regulation of the @entity38 colonial government in @entity25			1
as a result , its residents were free to build their dwellings as they wished , ignoring safety codes			0
" quite often houses were built by building onto the next building , punching out walls to use their staircases , " said @entity21			1
" a lot of them did n't have access to air or open space , because they were enclosed in the center of the structure			2
" deep within the building 's darkness , a variety of small businesses flourished			0
" the places that stuck out were the meat factories , " says @entity21			1
" there were pig carcasses laying splayed out on the floor ; they 'd burn the hair off with a blowtorch , it was all pretty open and of course there were no health laws governing the place			0
" but despite the @entity73 's wild appearance , the photographer found that the people inside lived just like people anywhere else			1
" people were doing very ordinary things , " he says			2
" it 's just that all these ordinary things were happening in an extraordinary place			0
" an ingenious community the complexity of the @entity16 also fascinated local architect @entity81 , now the director of @entity25 firm @entity82			1
a graduate student then , he wrote his thesis on the @entity16 as it was being torn down			1
" i was fascinated -- it was like a piece of machinery that worked very well			0
the demolition was like taking the machine apart -- the first time you could see what was inside			2
" it was a really humbling process for me as a designer -- when we met this @entity16 , we started to see that people could be more intelligent than us , the designers -- that they could think of ways to solve problems that are outside the traditional academic world			1
" @entity81 was especially impressed by @entity16 's water system			1
to support its dense population , residents dug extra wells and built thousands of pipes that twisted through the building			0
but since pumping water to the @entity73 's roof tanks required plenty of power , the people would take turns conserving electricity so that water could be shared successfully			2
" it revealed the community inside -- that no matter the challenges , they would find some intelligent way to solve it , " says @entity81			0
despite the ingenuity of the @entity16 , by 1994 it was completely torn down by the city government , which was eager to replace the chaotic and unregulated community with a public park			1
" seeing the @entity16 fall into disuse was sort of melancholic , " says @entity21			1
" every city realizes too late to start caring about their architectural heritage -- it 's a mistake that gets repeated everywhere			2
by the time you start caring about it , it 's too late to save it			0
" today , visitors to the site of the old @entity16 will find a placid garden with swaying trees and cloudy ponds			1
in the park there is a small museum in honor of @entity16			1
but when you look to the sky and imagine the colossus of @entity25 life that once stood , it 's easy to see that something significant has been lost			0
@entity0 : why we love the @entity73 neighborhood the @entity73 is not dead even today , the @entity73 's legacy lives on			0
a walled neighborhood called the @entity154 in the 2005 film " @entity156 " was based on @entity16			2
the @entity73 is even a level in the video game " @entity159 : @entity160			0
" because of the continued interest , @entity21 is working with his fellow @entity16 photographer @entity23 to finish a new book of their stunning photographs , entitled " city of darkness : revisited			1
" " you do n't want to romanticize a slum , you know			0
but it was much more than that			0
the @entity16 was a kind of architectural touchstone in terms of what a city can be -- unplanned , self - generated , unregulated			1
it was vital and vibrant and every part of it was being used			0
" @entity81 believes the spirit of the @entity16 continues to pulse through the heart of @entity25 itself			2
" go to @entity184 and look down upon this amazing collection of buildings coming together -- it 's almost like a blown up version of the @entity16 , right ? each building is related to the next building			2
new programs evolve because of the connections			0
" this organic chaos , he says , has been an inspiration for his own work			0
" many architects and urban planners like control , " he says			0
" but people like to get lost in the city			2
in my design process , i always consciously try to allow accidents , to allow others to participate , to surprise me			0
