it was a routine call for the @entity2 fighter pilot participating in @entity5 's @entity4 mission , high in the sky off @entity8 's coast			1
he was tasked with investigating and identifying an aircraft that had entered the mission 's patrol area in international airspace northwest of @entity8			1
@entity15 clouds dotted the piercing blue atmosphere , and it looked like it would be a non-eventful mission , until something gray darted in front of the @entity2 pilot 's @entity21 -- a @entity25 @entity24 fighter , according to the @entity26			1
" what the hell ! " is a loose , relatively polite translation of what he 's heard saying on video released by @entity2 military			1
" he was surprised and he expressed it , " @entity2 @entity34			0
@entity37 told @entity38 wednesday in a telephone interview			0
the video appears to be recorded from the @entity2 jet 's own camera , and shows the @entity25 fighter in the lower right quadrant of the shot			1
the @entity2 aircraft then banks sharply to the left to maneuver away from the @entity24			1
the encounter took place sometime in the past two years , @entity37 said			0
the video was released to show just " an example of the kind of situations that our pilots flying the @entity57 missions can encounter , " said capt. @entity58 , information officer for the @entity8 , in a statement wednesday			2
" we do not know if this incident was caused by the @entity25 pilot miscalculating the distance to the @entity2 fighter , or if it was an intentional maneuver			1
there have been a few incidents like this over the years , but i would like to press that the majority of the ( identifications ) made by @entity2 fighters take place without incident , " @entity58 's statement added			2
@entity76 's behavior unusual the @entity25 jet did n't appear to be acting in an aggressive manner , @entity37 said , but it 's not clear what it was doing			1
" he came too close ( to the @entity2 fighter ) , but he was not aggressive , " he said			2
@entity37 explained that a pilot he spoke to -- not the pilot in the video -- said it was an unusual situation , and that pilot could n't recall any similar behavior in the recent past			2
" when we observe unknown planes we identify them , so it was a normal mission for us to go and identify this plane , " @entity37 said			0
there was no attempt to make radio contact with the @entity25 jet , he said			0
@entity58 said it 's important to note that @entity8 has not experienced the same increase in @entity25 air activity in its area of responsibility as has been seen by partners in the @entity102			1
" last year we had 41 scrambles and identified 58 @entity25 aircraft			0
as of now , the numbers are 43/69 for 2014 , " the ministry statement said			0
@entity5 partners identify aircraft the @entity5 @entity4 mission tasks partners with patrolling the skies to identify suspicious aircraft			0
" this enables the @entity114 to detect , track and identify to the greatest extent possible all aerial objects approaching or operating within @entity5 airspace so that violations and infringements can be recognized , and the appropriate action taken , " said a statement on @entity5 's website			0
@entity122 official : ' dangerous ' @entity25 jet fly - by was ' straight out of a movie '			0

the @entity25 *mig* was not aggressive , but its behavior was unusual
@entity8 's @entity130 says it 's an example of what its pilots face
