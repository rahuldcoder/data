-- getting the convicted murderers pardoned by outgoing @entity5 gov. @entity4 back in prison is like " being on a manhunt with one arm tied behind my back , " the state 's attorney general said			1
highlighting the difficulty is the case of @entity13 , whom authorities finally located monday in @entity15 , said @entity16 , the attorney general			1
" we ca n't treat him as an escapee			0
he has a document that says he 's a free man as of now , " said @entity16			2
" all we have is a civil document we served him with			0
that is the most we can do			0
if he does n't show up in court , we will move to hold him in contempt			0
that 's the difficult part of this process			2
" @entity13 's whereabouts had been unknown since his mother picked him up on january 8 after his release			1
@entity31 is one of four convicted murderers @entity4 pardoned this month			1
the others are : @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
@entity31 did not appear at a court hearing in a case challenging the pardons			2
this week , a @entity42 , @entity5 , judge is expected to hear the case again			1
if @entity31 does not appear , the judge can hold him in contempt , @entity16 said			0
as he closed out his second term as governor , @entity4 granted " full pardons " -- meaning the convict 's record is effectively wiped clean -- to more than 200 people found guilty of a variety of crimes			1
all four of the convicted murderers he pardoned were serving life sentences and worked as trusties at the governor 's mansion			2
the move stirred outrage among relatives of the pardoned murderers ' victims			1
" it 's just an every minute , constant , in the back of your mind , where is he ? what is he doing ? " said @entity69 , sister of @entity70 , a store clerk shot to death by @entity31 in 1992			1
@entity13 pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole			1
he 's a cold - blooded murderer to do what he 's done , and if he thinks that he may go back to prison			1
what 's he got to lose ? " she said			2
also concerned is @entity83 , whose sister was shot and killed by @entity35			0
@entity35 walked into a trailer in 1993 where his estranged wife , @entity86 , lived and shot her in the head as she held their 6 - week - old baby in her arms			0
@entity92 said she wants her sister 's killer back in prison			1
" he got life plus 30 years , you know ? and he served 18 of them			0
my sister lived 20 years			0
it 's ridiculous , " she said			2
late monday , @entity16 spoke to @entity0 's " @entity103 , " slamming @entity4 and questioning the motives behind his pardons			1
" he ran the office of the governor as if it was @entity5 in the 1950s , " said @entity16			2
the attorney general , a @entity109 , said many of the inmates @entity4 , a @entity112 , pardoned came from influential families or had connections to the @entity112			1
" there 's not any logical explanation other than it was just a whim , and by doing it on a whim at the last moment that 's how he violated our @entity121 , " @entity16 said			0
@entity4 has defended his pardons			1
on friday , he appeared on @entity0 's " @entity123 , " saying @entity31 and the others have been rehabilitated			0
" he has no obligation to do anything			0
he 's a free man , " @entity4 said			1
authorities found @entity13 at a hotel in @entity130 , @entity15 , on monday			2
he had been staying under another name			0
