@entity1 launched four scud missiles into the sea off its eastern coast thursday , the @entity0 said			1
the missiles were fired in the direction of @entity7 and fell into the sea , according to the @entity8 , which described the launch as a very low - level matter			0
the missiles were fired just days after the start of annual joint military exercises between @entity14 and the @entity15 that @entity1 opposes			1
the joint military exercises routinely spark tension between @entity1 , @entity14 and the @entity15			1
for example , last year 's exercises triggered weeks of heightened tensions between the nations and @entity1 threats of nuclear war			2
the @entity14 and @entity15 militaries have not been specific about where they are conducting their drills			1
the @entity0 said that the @entity1 had fired the @entity27 in a northeasterly direction and that they probably fell into @entity1 waters of the @entity30 , which is also known as the @entity30			1
it was the first time @entity1 had fired scud missiles , which have a range that covers the whole of the @entity35 , since 2009 , @entity14 said			1
" we consider it to be threatening and a military provocation , " said @entity0 spokesman @entity36 , although he acknowledged the firings may have been a test launch or part of military drills			1
foreign policy experts say the @entity1 missile firings may not herald a repeat of last year 's saber rattling from @entity48 , which included threats of preemptive nuclear strikes against the @entity15 and @entity14 and the declaration that the armistice that stopped the @entity53 in 1953 is null and void			1
@entity1 tested a multistage rocket with possible intercontinental potential in december 2012 , and carried out a third nuclear test in february 2013			0
it was then stung by fierce international criticism and sanctions			0
it reacted angrily when 2013 's joint military exercises between @entity14 and the @entity15 involved stealth bombers simulating bombing attacks			1
the conditions of thursday 's missile launch are different			0
@entity1 's missile capabilities " it may be little more than regular military testing , " said @entity66 , a defense and foreign policy expert at the @entity69			1
" i 'm not persuaded it 's a big deal or even a medium big deal , though			0
" the launch may also be an attempt by @entity1 to remind the world and its own people that it has muscle , too			0
most observers say @entity1 is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile , but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower , including medium - range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles			2
" @entity1 's missile launch is merely part of their ongoing efforts to demonstrate to the world , and more importantly to their own people , what they are capable of			0
it is more showmanship than meaningful geopolitics , " @entity95 , editor of @entity96 , said thursday			0
" it is not a surprise , and we should expect more of the same so long as this regime is in place			0
" earlier this week , @entity14 said a @entity1 patrol boat strayed over the maritime border between the two countries several times			2
it eventually returned to the @entity1 's side of the border after warnings from @entity14			2
such infringements happen periodically , according to the @entity0			0
@entity1 shows off @entity14 man it 's holding on spy charges			2

@entity0 calls the move a military provocation
@entity1 launched four scud missiles into @entity30 , the @entity14 says
launch may be an effort to show off @entity1 capabilities , observer says
