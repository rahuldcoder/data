-- president @entity3 's @entity2 address tuesday night is likely to be the most important domestic speech that he gives during the rest of his presidency -- but not for the reasons commonly cited			1
conventional wisdom holds that the address offers the president the biggest platform -- and audience -- he will have to lay out his agenda and priorities for the next four years			2
environmentalists are eagerly awaiting his promises on regulation of existing coal - fired power plants , on the @entity18 and on international climate negotiations			2
the anti-gun community wants to know if he will fight for an assault weapons ban			2
@entity23 want to see how he will advance on immigration			0
and so on ... and on			0
these and other issues are significant and will feature heavily in post-address analysis			0
but at the end of the day , the transcendent issue -- at least for most @entity29 right now -- is whether the president will propel the economy forward by breaking the deadlock on the nation 's fiscal mess			1
this @entity2 address is probably the last chance that @entity3 has to reignite serious negotiations over a " grand bargain			1
" absent some sort of breakthrough soon , we are heading toward a sequester ( lots of automatic spending cuts in domestic and defense programs ) in march			0
that will in turn set off new rounds of squabbling and the likelihood that for months if not years to come , the nation will careen from one mini-crisis to the next , failing to solve underlying problems			0
for @entity3 , economists from @entity56 to @entity57 have argued for some time that jobs and growth would be best served by a two - stage process : new spending on infrastructure and the like in the near term ( more stimulus ) followed by iron - clad reductions in deficits over the long haul			1
instead , @entity69 is inviting just the opposite : a round of spending cuts in the near followed by weak , inadequate reductions in deficits over the long haul			0
both will be a drag on growth and jobs			0
@entity79 argue that @entity80 are to blame -- and clearly they deserve a great deal of criticism , especially for their obstructionism			1
but the day after the elections , @entity84 house speaker @entity84 offered tax increases , a huge concession , and now it is the @entity79 who seem less willing to make tough choices and strike a long - term bargain			1
moreover , @entity3 is the only leader in @entity69 elected by all the people , and as president , he has prime responsibility for finding a path forward			1
what can he do in his @entity2 to achieve a breakthrough ? two suggestions : first , he should make a forthright new offer to republicans : in exchange for them calling off the sequester and agreeing to infrastructure investments , he will offer them a set of concrete steps he will support to bring @entity108 and @entity109 under control			1
in addition , he will name negotiators to work with @entity113 , starting this year , on tax and entitlement changes , and additional tax increases and spending cuts to put our house in order			0
both sides will have to compromise further than they have so far on cherished commitments			0
second , the president should commit to working with republicans to create a new tone for their relationship			1
instead of each side looking upon negotiations as " i win ; you lose , " the goal must be to create a " win - win			1
" it is not necessary that each side like the other , but it is necessary that each side puts country first			0
are these two steps hopelessly idealistic ? probably			0
if anything , all signs point in exactly the opposite direction			0
on substance , the president continues to say he would like a grand bargain but mostly on his terms , and he has done virtually nothing to fight for it			1
indeed , in his inaugural , he seemed to step back from overhauling entitlements , portraying himself as chief defender of @entity108 and @entity109			0
as the sequester approaches , he has offered a tactical set of small - bore proposals , not a strategic plan that would break the deadlock			2
down deep , has he decided that he does n't really care whether we solve the deficit mess on his watch -- that he accepts the liberal notion that it 's a problem for 2020 , not now ? one wonders			2
on tone , the president has pivoted even more			2
instead of the conciliatory @entity3 of the first term , we have seen a hard - nosed pugilist who paints republicans as wackos ready to hurt senior citizens and starve children to protect the rich			1
it was discouraging to read monday 's lead article in @entity171 in which correspondent @entity174 , citing @entity79 in the @entity172 and on @entity173 , reported that @entity3 in his @entity2 will offer the @entity80 not an olive branch but a cattle prod			1
one @entity3 aide close to the drafting process quoted @entity179 : " build your enemy a golden bridge on which to retreat			2
" this is a team that wants a win - win negotiation over the deficits ? the suspicion deepens that the @entity3 folks have secretly adopted a strategy of making @entity80 look so extreme that they will be driven from power in 2014 and the president can then govern as he chooses in his final two years in office			1
for the country 's sake , one hopes this suspicion is wrong			0
the window for achieving a grand bargain has been closing rapidly and could slam shut tuesday night			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 : president @entity3 's @entity2 could be crucial for second term
he says if @entity3 does n't get @entity80 to the table , we could see high - stakes *budget* fight
it would be a mistake for @entity79 to think they can win by *refusing* to negotiate , he says
he says @entity3 's shift in tone to more *partisan* approach is a big mistake
