-- every sport has its gods			0
in boxing it 's @entity4 , in soccer it 's @entity7 's @entity6 and in basketball it 's @entity9 , but this week @entity10 , already a country with no shortage of deities , paid homage to cricket legend @entity14			1
the 40 - year - old 's final bow as a professional cricketer came saturday as @entity10 completed an innings and 186 run victory over the @entity20 on his home @entity22 in @entity23			1
@entity14 's part in the proceedings on the final day amounted to a couple of overs of bowling , cheered to the rafters by a packed stadium , which could have sold out 10 times over			2
after the final @entity20 wicket fell , a tearful @entity14 held court with an emotional speech in which he thanked everyone who had supported him , particularly his father , who passed away in 1999			1
" without his guidance i do n't think i would be standing in front of you , " he said			0
tributes also followed for his mother , his wife @entity41 and their two children before he turned his attention to his fanatical following in @entity10			2
" i know there are so many guys who 've fasted for me , prayed for me , done all sorts of things for me			0
without all that life would n't have been like this for me , " he said			0
" i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and say that time has gone by rather quickly , but the memories that you 've left with me will always be with me forever and ever			2
" many in the crowd were left in tears and they roared out his name in approval , grateful for his incredible career which saw him become the first man to score 100 international centuries			0
a further century proved out of @entity14 's reach in his final test , dismissed for 74 friday as @entity10 took command of a match they wrapped up the next day to win the series 2 - 0			1
our god but his fans will forgive him this relative " failure " because @entity14 is not just a sports star , but also an icon in a country of more than 1.2 billion people			1
his fans often wave placards at matches that read , " cricket is my religion and @entity14 is my @entity82			1
" himself a devout @entity84 , the diminutive 5 - feet 5 - inch all - rounder was well - known throughout his career as a modest superstar who never lost his cool either at the batting crease or in front of the cameras and fans			0
former @entity10 captain @entity92 told @entity0 that @entity14 would be remembered as " the benchmark " against which all the nation 's cricketers measured themselves			1
in a game where 100 runs -- or a century -- is regarded as the high - water mark of batting achievement in any match at any level , @entity14 last year reached 100 hundreds at international level and now holds almost all coveted batting records except for cricket legend @entity105 's career average of 99.94 runs			1
even " @entity105 " as he is known in @entity108 -- the cricketing prodigy of the 1930s and ' 40s who was still alive when @entity14 made his test debut in 1989 -- once remarked on the @entity14 's prodigious talent			1
" i saw him playing on the television and i was very , very struck by his technique			0
i asked my wife to come and have a look at him			0
because , i said , i never saw myself play , but i feel that this feller is playing much the same as i used to play ... it was just his compactness , his stroke production , his technique , it all seemed to gel as far as i was concerned , " @entity105 told reporters			0
completing his stellar career , @entity14 scored 15,921 runs in 200 test matches at an average of 53.78 each innings , and 18,426 runs in 463 one - day international matches at 44.83 each time at bat			1
@entity132 -- the famous @entity108 leg spin bowler and another of @entity105 's favorite contemporary cricketers -- rated him the greatest player of the modern game			2
" @entity14 is , in my time , the best player without a doubt -- daylight second , @entity138 third , " said @entity132 , who said of the @entity143 that it was " a pleasure bowling to him			1
" true sportsman @entity108 cricket commentator @entity147 said @entity14 was well - known for his grace under pressure in a sport better known in modern times for its towering egos			2
" certainly , he has left a strong imprint on his cricket contemporaries , " @entity147 wrote in the @entity108 newspaper			0
" they knew him , for example , for never throwing his bat after a dismissal ; he would sit down in the dressing room , reflect , but never brood			0
" in @entity10 , his popularity has reached beyond cricket 's stadiums and -- with a career unsullied by controversy or scandal -- he has become a marketer 's dream			2
with a net worth of about $ 160 million from endorsements , property and cricket earnings , according to @entity175 - based @entity174 , @entity14 is cricket 's richest player and the country 's biggest icon			1
walk into any shopping mall in @entity10 , and there 's a good chance you will see @entity14 on a poster or a billboard			1
he endorses 17 products including @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
@entity186 has spent $ 50 million on advertising over the past five years -- and half of that on @entity14 alone			1
" it has worked phenomenally , " @entity193 's senior vice president @entity192 told @entity0			0
" we notice that the awareness of our brand is improving and since people respect him a lot there 's almost a subtle admission that if @entity14 is saying it , then it has to be true			2
" @entity14 is known to be choosey about what he endorses and will not , for instance , put his name to alcohol , despite large offers from corporations despite his commercial success , the " @entity14 " says it 's always been about the cricket			2
" the fact was that it was all happening because of cricket and my focus always stayed on cricket , the rest of these things happened around cricket and even today cricket is the focal point , cricket is the ultimate thing for me ... it 's that simple , " he told @entity0 in an interview in 2008			0
@entity0 's @entity222 also contributed to this report .			0
