@entity0 was a rookie cop on september 11 , 2001			0
he worked at ground zero for 11 days beside his colleagues -- many of them , including @entity0 , not wearing a mask			1
he was later assigned to a landfill in @entity5 , where debris from the @entity7 was dumped			0
for about 60 days between 2001 and 2002 , the @entity9 police officer was surrounded by dust			0
in 2005 , @entity0 was diagnosed with thyroid cancer			1
he underwent surgery and radiation			0
just months later his doctor told him he also had multiple myeloma , a blood cancer that multiplies the body 's plasma cells to dangerous levels			1
it 's a cancer that usually strikes much later in life			1
more than 1,100 people who worked or lived near the @entity7 on 9/11 have been diagnosed with cancer , according to the @entity24			1
a few months ago @entity0 received a letter from the @entity24 's @entity26 , officially offering him medical insurance under the @entity28			1
about 1,140 people have been certified to receive cancer treatment under the @entity32 , a representative told @entity33			1
these are the first numbers released since the program was expanded a year ago			0
in september 2012 , federal health authorities added 58 types of cancer to the list of covered illnesses for people who were exposed to toxins at the site of the @entity7 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks			1
dr. @entity46 , administrator of the @entity32 , had said the year before that cancer treatments would not be covered by the compensation fund			1
at the time , he said there was inadequate " published scientific and medical findings " to link 9/11 exposures to cancer			1
9/11 responders wait for compensation for illnesses others argued that hundreds of chemical compounds , among them known carcinogens , were present in the dust surrounding ground zero			1
potential cancer - causing agents such as asbestos that coated the @entity7 buildings ' lower columns , and benzene , a component of jet fuel that caused uncontrollable fires when planes barreled into the twin towers , have long been a cancer concern for researchers			1
scientists were also worried about the high volume of particulates and gases inhaled by responders , survivors and people who lived in the area			1
yet some officials were worried about making the connection between 9/11 and cancer too soon			2
when the proposal to add cancer coverage was made , experts estimated the cost would total between $ 14.5 million and $ 33 million			2
and while someone 's cancer may have been caused by his or her work at ground zero , it might also have been a coincidence -- they may have gotten cancer anyway			1
a long lag time makes it particularly difficult to study the link			2
@entity96 does n't develop quickly after breathing in something toxic , the way asthma might			2
instead , leukemia can take five to six years to develop , and solid tumors can take 10 to 20 years			2
compensation comes too late for one man in the end , it was a study of firefighters that helped persuade the government to include cancer in the @entity32			1
researchers found firefighters who worked at ground zero were 19 % more likely to develop cancer than firefighters who did not			1
according to the 2011 study , published in @entity116 medical journal , the increase occurred during the first seven years after 9/11			2
there were subtle increases seen in a few cancers in particular , including gastro - esophageal cancers and blood cancers such as multiple myeloma and @entity125 's lymphoma			0
one theory about how the cancers may have developed so soon among responders is that the unique characteristics of ground zero dust , and the sheer number of chemicals contained in it , may have accelerated disease			2
the @entity32 will act as a backup insurance for @entity0 , whose primary insurance through the city has been taking care of his medical expenses			0
doctors are n't treating his multiple myeloma now ; it 's asymptomatic , so they 're simply watching it			0
but when it does start to cause problems -- and it will , his doctors say -- they 'll begin a treatment program			2
for @entity0 , receiving the @entity32 welcome letter was more about recognition than assistance			0
" they looked over my medical records ... determined cause and effect , " he said			0
" after years saying , ' we do n't know , we 're not sure , ' they finally said , ' yeah , you got it from there			0
' " and @entity0 knows the program will be a big help to those who do n't have good health insurance -- folks who lived or worked in the area who have since been diagnosed			2
he said he thinks the number of people who have , or who will get , cancer related to 9/11 is a lot higher than 1,140 , something only time will tell			1
the @entity32 was created as a result of the passage of the @entity173 and @entity174			0
the @entity175 , passed by @entity176 in december 2010 , is designed to provide medical services and compensation for responders who were exposed to toxins while working at ground zero			0
president @entity182 signed the $ 4.2 billion legislation in january 2011			0
the law is named after a @entity9 police officer who died of a respiratory disease attributed to working amid the toxic chemicals at the attack site			0
first responders , volunteers , survivors of the attacks and residents near the 9/11 site who meet specific qualifications are eligible for coverage , according to the @entity24			0
the program has also been recently expanded to include responders from the @entity201 attack and @entity202 , @entity203 , where @entity204 crashed			1
people are still enrolling from those locations so the @entity26 does not have an accurate count of how many people were affected , a representative told @entity33			0
to determine eligibility for the @entity32 , visit www.cdc.gov/wtc			0
my son died as a first responder			0

under @entity28 , about 1,140 people will receive cancer treatment
others from the @entity201 and @entity202 , @entity203 , are applying now
