the @entity1 is preparing to announce a decision " in the coming days " on assistance to @entity4 , the @entity0 said tuesday , and @entity1 officials told @entity6 military aid will be cut , though not all of it			1
the announcement comes in the wake of the july coup against president @entity13 and the turmoil that has followed as recently as this week , one @entity1 official said tuesday			1
however , some military aid could continue , including funds to uphold @entity4 's obligations under its peace treaty with @entity19 , and money for counterterrorism and security in @entity23 , where extremists have been able to set up base , according to a senior @entity1 official			1
the @entity1 will also maintain nonmilitary funding that helps democracy promotion , the official said			2
in an initial report about the announcement , @entity6 did not specify that these portions of the aid would continue			0
@entity13 gets trial date as @entity4 turmoil continues the @entity36 administration withheld some military aid to @entity4 in august			1
another @entity1 official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the move to suspend assistance -- more than $ 1 billion is given each year -- has been prompted by an " accumulation of events , " including recent violence against protesters , dozens of whom were killed over the weekend			1
the @entity1 has not yet notified the @entity4 of the decision to cut off military aid , a senior official said			1
the announcement is not expected to be made on wednesday and has already been pushed back a few times , the official said			0
in a statement late tuesday , @entity55 spokeswoman @entity54 said an announcement is coming soon but denied the @entity1 is " halting all military assistance			1
" " we will announce the future of our assistance relationship with @entity4 in the coming days , but as the president made clear at @entity65 , that assistance relationship will continue , " @entity54 said in a statement			0
any decision to cut aid would not preclude resuming the aid should @entity4 make what the @entity1 believes are positives steps towards restoring democracy , officials said			1
death toll rises as violence rages @entity1 national security advisers recommended to the president last month that aid should be cut , @entity1 officials told @entity6 in september			2
the recommendation , officials said , was made in a " principals meeting " of the president 's national security team , including national security adviser @entity84 , secretary of state @entity85 and defense secretary @entity86			0
the meeting was the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to the july 3 ouster of @entity13 , @entity4 's first democratically elected leader			0
in addition to the suspension of some military aid earlier this year , there has also been a severe slowdown in military shipments from the @entity1 to @entity4 , including f - 16s			1
the @entity36 administration has not labeled @entity13 's removal from office a coup			0
such a designation would require a cut in all but humanitarian aid			0
in the past , the @entity0 has said it was in @entity1 national security interests to keep the aid intact			0
but after @entity1 calls to the @entity4 military for restraint over the last few months were met with a heavy - handed crackdown on @entity13 supporters , @entity36 canceled a joint military exercise and announced a new review of @entity1 aid to @entity4			1
last month , @entity1 officials said @entity36 's national security team had recommended a cut in aid that included all foreign military financing to the @entity4 military , except funding toward security in the @entity23 and along the @entity4 border with @entity122			1
" this has been coming for quite a while , actually , and president @entity36 signaled that the @entity1 was slowing down aid to @entity4 in his address at the @entity130 just a couple of weeks ago , " said @entity123 , an @entity124 affairs analyst at the @entity125			1
" the @entity1 has become increasingly disillusioned with the way that the military leadership has cracked down on its own people			0
over 1,000 died in the early weeks after the military coup , and in the past week , you 've seen dozens more killed in confrontations			0
" @entity6 senior international correspondent @entity137 said in the short - term , the @entity1 decision could have a positive impact on the @entity4 government			2
" immediately , probably , the @entity4 government is going to find it 's going to gain somewhat in terms of local public opinion , " @entity137 said			0
" @entity4 i 've already been in touch with about this decision or announcement from the @entity1 that it 's going to cut aid seem to react positively			1
there seems to be a lot of frustration with the @entity1 , given its role in @entity4 over the last 2Â½ years since the revolution			2
" but do n't expect to see @entity4 's military hurting financially , @entity137 said			0
" for the @entity4 government , a cutoff in @entity1 aid is symbolically significant , but in terms of the actual amount of money they 're getting , it will not make a big difference , " he said			2
@entity137 said that 's because @entity162 have been pouring billions of dollars into @entity4 since @entity13 's ouster			0
a move to cut off aid would likely anger those @entity162 allies who have urged the @entity1 to support the military and warned against stopping assistance			2
after weeks of relative calm , violent clashes in @entity4			0
