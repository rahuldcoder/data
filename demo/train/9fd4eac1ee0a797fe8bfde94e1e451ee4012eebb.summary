@entity0 is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the @entity3			2
read his column here @entity0 says @entity5 is n't a failed state , but the fate of its drug war is important for @entity10			1
@entity11 , @entity12 ( @entity13 ) -- you may have heard the rumor that , as a result of a bloody drug war that has claimed more than 7,000 lives since january 2007 , @entity5 is on the verge of being declared a " failed state			1
" drawing a lot of its oxygen from cable demagogues and talk radio , the chatter intensified several weeks ago when the @entity26 issued a report warning that our neighbor -- along with @entity30 , no less -- could face a " rapid and sudden " collapse because " the government , its politicians , police and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels			2
" how 's this for pressure ? the police chief in @entity42 resigned last week after drug traffickers began to make good on their promise to kill police officers in that city until the chief stepped down			2
the @entity5 drug war is the real deal , and so is the threat to both @entity5 and the @entity10			1
the killings are becoming more brutal , and now include the beheading of soldiers			0
the cartels are essentially terrorizing the @entity5 people in the hopes of convincing them to put pressure on the government to relent in its efforts to put the bad guys out of business			0
take it from someone who has known @entity5 president @entity66 since before he took the job -- back when we were in graduate school together nearly a decade ago -- that 's not going to happen			1
@entity66 was brave enough to take on the drug cartels by arresting their leaders , confiscating their product , and -- most importantly -- seizing the large shipments of cash that they need to operate			2
and he 's smart enough to know that letting up on the pressure before the task is done would only make matters worse and basically hand @entity5 over to the drug lords meanwhile , there is no question that @entity10 will pay a price if the drug violence spills over the border			1
just a few days ago , the @entity86 issued a blunt travel advisory warning @entity10 with plans to travel in @entity5 to be extra careful			1
" recent @entity5 army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small - unit combat , with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades , " the advisory reads			2
" large firefights have taken place in towns and cities ... and during some of these incidents , @entity10 citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area			0
" firefights will put a crimp in the tourist industry			0
but , @entity5 are quick to point out the irony			0
here @entity10 are worried about their safety in @entity5 when one of the reasons the @entity5 government is having such a difficult time fighting the drug cartels is because the enemy has plenty of money and guns			1
and both are coming from the north			0
according to most estimates , about 90 percent of all the cocaine flowing into the @entity10 comes from @entity5 and about 90 percent of the guns seized in drug - related violence come from the @entity10			1
former president @entity125 and @entity126 deserve credit for pushing through $ 400 million in emergency aid in the @entity129 to help the @entity5 government fight the cartels			1
and even though @entity5 is still waiting for delivery of most of those funds , there were signals this week that the @entity136 administration understands the stakes involved			0
homeland security secretary @entity138 announced new measures to prevent the violence from spreading to this side of the border and told @entity126 that the issue demands the " utmost attention			0
" attorney general @entity145 called the drug cartels a " national security threat " to the @entity10 and said @entity10 " simply ca n't afford to let down our guard			1
" even so , this business about @entity5 on its way to being a " failed state " is just a lot of hot air			1
the rumors of our neighbor 's demise have been greatly exaggerated			0
a country of 110 million people , @entity5 is still a functioning democracy with press freedoms and bold leaders , like @entity66 , who are tackling the issue of drug violence head on			1
there is plenty of reason for optimism			0
frankly , one reason the doomsday talk about @entity5 catches on is because it distracts @entity10 from our own problems			1
i learned a long time ago that , for many of my countrymen , @entity5 serves a purpose in tough times by providing something to which we can feel superior			0
even with the banking bailouts , mortgage crisis , a plummeting stock market and rising unemployment , the thinking goes , we can at least be grateful that we 're not @entity5			0
for @entity187 like me , that 's cold comfort			0
i expect a lot more of my country -- the @entity10 -- than i do the country that my grandfather left behind a hundred years ago when he legally immigrated north			2
and right now , what i expect is for all @entity10 to realize -- and for the @entity136 administration to never forget -- that it 's impossible to feel safe when there is a wildfire in the neighborhood			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			0

@entity0 : @entity5 's drug war is serious , but it 's not a " failed state "
he says the @entity10 has a lot at stake in the outcome of the fight
@entity0 : @entity5 's president is smart and brave and knows he ca n't surrender
the country has a big *population* , free press and bold leaders , he says
