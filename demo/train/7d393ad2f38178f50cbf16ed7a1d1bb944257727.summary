@entity0 -- with the financial crisis in the eurozone , @entity2 finds itself in a position that everybody seems to envy , except the @entity2 themselves			1
the government and a majority of @entity2 citizens would like to shine through example rather than action			2
if only others would emulate the " @entity2 model , " so the argument goes , there would be no crisis in the eurozone			1
@entity19 : @entity21 's mrs. @entity20 one could easily discard this as the flattering self - image that all patriots have of their own country			1
but the curious thing is that the critics of @entity2 come to almost the same conclusion , except that they would admire the @entity2 model without the permanent export surplus			1
yet , like all such models , it is at best a half - truth			0
there is a myth that @entity2 are still traumatized by the hyperinflation of the interwar years , a memory that has somehow become part of the genetic endowment of every @entity2			2
@entity40 : the man who stirred up @entity2 politics that 's why the @entity45 government insisted on making the @entity47 a clone of the @entity48 -- except that the two central banks pursue very different monetary strategies : the @entity47 does nothing to maintain a permanent export surplus of the euro area as the @entity48 did for its currency area back then			1
the @entity48 achieved this exactly as @entity56 achieves it today : instead of selling all the foreign exchange it earned from its export surplus , it hoarded vast foreign exchange reserves			0
this prevented an appreciation of the @entity63 because piling up these reserves means somebody expresses huge demand for dollars , francs and pounds			0
watch : @entity19 says @entity21 has lost competitiveness but there is one snag			2
handing out your own currency against all these foreign exchange earnings can create inflation and thus real appreciation : the price of domestic goods rises in terms of foreign goods and makes domestic goods more expensive			0
so the @entity48 reined in domestic credit supply -- according to the jargon , it sterilized ( or counteracted ) the expansion of the money supply through trade by reducing the money supply that is generated in domestic credit			0
all this is to say that what explains the anti-inflationary stance of @entity2 monetary policy was not the trauma of the 1920s but the @entity48 playing its part in maintaining export surpluses			0
it actually had a worse inflation record than the @entity47 and back then , it did not think that 2 % inflation was the tolerable maximum : as long as the trading partners had a higher one , why care about such a number ? such an undervaluation strategy makes perfect sense -- and only perfect sense -- when you are concerned about employment and demand for your products			0
it 's a @entity109 concern			0
this , then , is the second myth that @entity2 and the country 's critics share : the @entity2 lands are populated by " ordoliberals , " a teutonic version of small - but - strong - state liberalism that is anti-keynesian			1
it was certainly different from the @entity117 with its then - fashionable version of @entity119 , namely domestic pump priming			0
@entity117 administrations criticized the @entity2 authorities for their macroeconomic strategy of begging the transatlantic neighbor just as they criticize the @entity56 authorities today			1
pushed into a corner , the accused would always say they did not interfere ( @entity2 ) or act in self - defense ( @entity56 )			1
but @entity129 knew about beggar - thy - neighbor policies that countries with underemployment pursue , even if he did not endorse them			1
does the performance of @entity2 today not prove that its success is down to the fact that the @entity2 work so hard and save so much ? that 's another convenient myth that the critics grudgingly concede			2
what does n't quite fit the myth is that @entity2 have relatively low annual working hours in comparison with other nations			2
labor market reforms in the early 2000s helped to create more jobs with fewer hours , and the hours each employee works have gone down further over the past decade			0
while the overall volume of work went up by less than 3 % between 2002 and 2012 , the number of people in work went up by almost 6 %			0
read more : @entity153 crisis tarnishes @entity2 's ' @entity154 ' there are also many more jobs that are poorly paid			1
together with the @entity157 , @entity2 is the @entity21 country with the highest share of low wage workers			1
these are defined as workers that earn less than two thirds of the national median wage : 22 % of all those employed in @entity2 are low - paid , only @entity165 ( 24 % ) , @entity166 ( 26 % ) and @entity167 ( 28 % ) have higher shares			1
labor market reforms arguably scared organized labor into accepting wage increases below the rise in productivity , so unit labor costs fell			0
such state - induced and coordinated wage competition is new			0
it helps maintain the export surplus but it busts the myth that @entity2 competitiveness is all about quality products and not wage costs			2
as to savings : the world was recently surprised by a report of the @entity47 that showed how little wealth @entity2 have accumulated if they supposedly save so much			0
the puzzle has been solved : first of all , @entity2 get their old age security from public pensions rather than from home - ownership but pensions were excluded from the survey			2
@entity2 firms hold more capital than most others in @entity21			1
the discrepancy between the value of domestic production and the value of domestic consumption mostly accrues to firms , making the wealth distribution one of the most unequal in @entity21			0
all of this means that what @entity2 wage earners consume has much lower value than what they produce ( and earn in wages ) , and not that @entity2 are constantly tightening their belts			2
the unfortunate consequence of these myths is that they harden @entity2 's stance towards a solution to the crisis in the eurozone			1
if their success as an export nation has supposedly nothing to do with policies and is all due to hard work and avid saving , then indeed why should the others not become " more like us ? " but if @entity2 still pursues beggar - thy - neighbor policies in order to create more jobs , the hard work is on average now just less well - paid work , and the savings are disproportionately enriching firms , then perhaps even @entity2 will see that something is wrong , and that continuing to behave like a successful emerging market is not a model for the rest of the @entity153 , not only because it beggars - the - neighbors but also because it does little for ordinary people in @entity2			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			0

many in struggling countries across the eurozone envy @entity2 's strong economy
economist @entity240 says the " @entity2 model " is not as perfect as it may appear
@entity240 : @entity2 's beggar - my - neighbor policies also hurt the country 's own people
@entity2 has the highest share of low wage workers in @entity21
