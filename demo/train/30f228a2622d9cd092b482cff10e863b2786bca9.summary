-- a day after a jury deadlocked on whether @entity3 should be sentenced to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend , the jury foreman described the decision process as tense and emotional			1
" it was a gut - wrenching thing we had to go through , and everybody had to make their own decision , " @entity9 told @entity16 's " @entity15			1
" the foreman said some of the most difficult testimony to hear came from the dead man 's relatives			1
" until you 're face to face with people that have gone through something like that , it 's something that you really ca n't put into words , " he said			1
" i 'm 6 feet away from somebody talking about a horrendous loss , and if you ca n't feel that , then you have no emotion , no soul			1
and yet we could n't allow ourselves to be emotional on the stand			1
" we could n't allow ourselves to show emotion , although i 'm sure some came through , and i 'm very , very proud of my peers and my jurors that were with us because they did a fantastic job of holding it together			1
" that stoicism in the face of emotional testimony disappeared in the jury room , he said			1
@entity9 said the 32 - year - old defendant simply did not fit his image of a murderer			1
" when you look at a young woman and you think of the crime , and then you see the brutality of the crime , it just does n't wash , " he said			1
" it 's very difficult to divest yourself from the personal , from the emotional part of it			1
" though the jury did not believe @entity64 ' story that she killed @entity3 in self - defense , @entity9 said he believed @entity67 abused her			1
" i 'm very sure , in my own mind , that she was mentally and verbally abused , " he said			1
" now , is that an excuse ? of course not			1
does it factor into decisions we make ? it has to			1

" she was not a good witness , " he said			1
" there were so many contradicting stories			1

" i think the way the prosecutor was with her -- he 's known for an aggressive style -- i think it was very hard , i think it would be difficult for anybody			2

they pronounced her guilty of first - degree murder			0
for @entity64 to be sentenced to death , a jury 's decision must be unanimous			0

on tuesday , she pleaded with jurors to spare her			0
she called @entity67 's murder " the worst mistake " she had ever made , " the worst thing i 've ever done			0
" she could n't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime , @entity64 told the jury			1
