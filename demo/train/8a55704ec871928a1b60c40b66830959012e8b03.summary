@entity1 , @entity0 -- the downing of a @entity0 jet over the @entity5 last friday by a @entity7 missile took @entity0 - @entity7 tensions to a new level			1
though the @entity0 government did not declare war as some expected , and others feared , it did declare @entity7 a " clear and present danger " and raised its rules of engagement to an alert level			1
how we came to this point is an interesting story			0
the 550 - mile long border with @entity7 , @entity0 's longest , has often been tense			1
during the @entity22 , @entity7 was a @entity24 ally , @entity0 was a @entity26 member ( as it still is ) and the border was heavily mined			1
moreover , @entity28 , the father and predecessor of @entity7 's current dictator , @entity30 , supported and hosted the @entity31 , the outlawed @entity31 , which has led a guerrilla war against @entity0 since the early ' 80s			1
( @entity31 is defined by @entity0 and the @entity33 as a terrorist group			0
) @entity0 had come close to waging a war against @entity7 in 1999 because of this @entity31 connection			1
@entity0 moves forces to @entity7 border amid tensions , official says however , the relations surprisingly changed for the better in the first decade of the new century			1
@entity30 , who replaced his father in 2000 , seemed to promise a more open and friendly @entity7			0
in @entity0 , the @entity43 of @entity44 , which came to power in 2002 , initiated a foreign policy of " zero problems with neighbors			1
" this led to a fruitful @entity0 - @entity7 rapprochment : @entity44 and @entity30 became friends , trade between the two countries was boosted , and borders were opened for visa - free travel			1
just two years ago , the two countries looked like the core states of a would - be @entity57 modeled after the @entity59			0
but this honeymoon came to an abrupt end with the @entity62			0
the @entity44 government , whose claims include democratizing @entity0 by saving it from the tutelage of the country 's overbearing military , intuitively sympathized with and announced support for this democratic wave in the region			1
yet while this proved to be a winning game in @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity7 turned out to be a tougher case			0
throughout the initial months of the demonstrations in @entity7 , which began in march 2011 , the @entity0 government hoped and tried to persuade @entity30 's regime to allow a peaceful transition to democracy			1
this hope was gradually replaced by frustration , however , and @entity44 soon began to condemn the " barbarism " and " savagery " of the @entity7 regime			2
the trouble for him , as it usually is , was also personal : as he said in the @entity88 on june 21 , @entity30 had promised him change and reform but proved to be a liar instead			0
consequently , @entity0 rapidly emerged as one of the boldest supporters of the @entity7 opposition , and the @entity95 , formed as the dissidents ' umbrella group , found a base in @entity0			2
meanwhile , at least 15,000 refugees from @entity7 , both dissidents and their families , were given shelter on the @entity0 side of the @entity7 border			2
moreover , the @entity105 , a rebel group formed by the @entity7 soldiers who deserted to the opposition 's side , not only operated from @entity0 but , according to some reports , were helped with arms and other supplies as well			1
the @entity7 response was to add @entity0 to its own version of the axis of evil -- the @entity33 , @entity26 , @entity115 and in fact much of the rest of the world -- in its official propaganda			2
inside @entity0 , this engagement in the @entity7 crisis has supporters and critics			2
the supporters are mostly @entity125 conservatives who strongly identify with the @entity7 opposition , which include the @entity126			0
( the massacre of thousands of @entity125 in @entity128 in 1982 by @entity28 had been a tragic memory in the minds of these conservative @entity0 , who now believe that the @entity7 leopard has simply not changed its spots			2
) other voices in @entity0 , ranging from hardcore secularists to @entity137 marginal @entity136 , accuse the government for being naively involved in a conflict cooked up by " @entity141 imperialists			0
" the plane incident came on top of all this			0
the downed jet was apparently an unarmed but military aircraft which , according to the @entity0 government , was on a peaceful mission to test the @entity26 radar system based in eastern @entity0			0
@entity7 said the plane violated @entity7 airspace and was shot within it			0
the @entity0 government said the plane violated the @entity7 airspace " mistakenly and very briefly " but was hit by a @entity7 missile despite immediately having reverted to international airspace			1
the plane 's two pilots , who apparently fell to the sea , are missing			0
the @entity0 reaction to the incident was outlined by @entity44 in an address in the parliament that came four days after the incident			2
in a very strident tone against the " bloody dictator of @entity7 , " @entity44 announced that @entity0 now sees its southern neighbor as a " clear and present danger " and will change its rules of engagement : " any military element that approaches the @entity0 border from @entity7 by posing a security risk will be regarded as a threat , and will be treated as a military target			1
" the very same day , some @entity0 tanks on the @entity7 border were repositioned , implying that @entity175 meant business			2
yet almost no one in @entity0 seems enthusiastic for war			0
many here point out that @entity0 's ascendance in the past decade has been thanks to its " soft power			1
" that mainly rested on the country 's economic boom and democratic reforms , which seemed to present a synthesis of @entity136 , free - market capitalism and political liberalism			0
photos : in @entity7 hospital , no escape from war but should @entity0 now consider putting some " hard power " on the table , without which it might become ineffective in its region ? this is a question that @entity0 are passionately discussing these days , and the answer seems to matter a lot for the @entity7 as well			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

@entity201 : @entity7 downing of @entity0 plane has brought countries ' tensions to new level
he says relations had *evolved* to friendly until @entity62 ; @entity7 *aggression* opened new *divide*
he says @entity0 's @entity44 had tried to ease @entity7 to peace , but now it 's in military posture
@entity219 : @entity0 used " soft power " to gain regional strength . must it use " hard power ' to keep it ?
