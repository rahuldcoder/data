-- @entity1 might be viewed as booming emerging market , but with growth has come problems			1
around 50 million @entity1 live in inadequate housing , according to the @entity7 @entity6			1
a recent @entity9 report says between 85 and 90 % of the deficit is within poor families , who have been hit by soaring real estate prices , sluggish earnings growth and a swelling population			0
but in ond of @entity18 's sprawling suburbs , one former tech entrepreneur believes he has an answer			1
@entity20 , founder of construction firm @entity21 , aims to succeed where government and construction giants have failed			1
his answer is houses that are quick to build , traditional in construction , and sold direct to consumers for them to develop themselves			1
nimble construction large construction companies attempting to raise finance for construction and negotiate government bureaucracy have found themselves mired			0
@entity20 explains that a smaller company can move faster			2
" i think the core here is that we are operating in a gap where the big ones are not operating , and produce something that has huge demand , " he tells @entity0 at the company 's development at @entity35 , 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) north of @entity18			1
the company eschews @entity18 city center , where @entity20 says land prices make development for those on low incomes uneconomical			1
instead , it snaps up plots at the rural fringes of the city , or in cities further out into @entity18 state			2
the company aims to stay " light " -- outsourcing infrastructure to the land developer , buying ready - to - use concrete blocks , and handing the marketing and sales to a local broker -- so it can concentrate on the construction			0
in doing so , @entity20 claims to reduce the time from development to sale by more than 50 %			2
traditional values the houses are built to the same plan			2
each is 46 square meters with a living room , two bedrooms , a kitchen and a bathroom			0
each is marketed at around 150,000 @entity73 ( $ 63,000 ) , designed to appeal to families at the bottom end of @entity1 's growing middle class			1
" we build in the traditional way we do in @entity1 , which is bricks and mortar or concrete -- no plastic composites or things like that , " says @entity20			1
the old - fashioned brickwork masks the progressive ideas behind it			0
in addition to an ambition to provide jobs for local people ( with traditional building techniques quicker to train to new workers that specialist techniques ) , @entity20 hopes to build houses that aspirant buyers will be able to develop further independently			1
" the important thing here is that after they own the asset they improve the asset			0
they generate more value in the asset , " he says			0
so far @entity107 has built 4,000 houses			2
at @entity35 , there are homes under construction and families already living on site			0
@entity20 describes the ambition to create a " dynamic neighborhood			0
" the former banker admits the job might not boast the biggest numbers , but it has something else : " it 's not the most profitable business you can find			0
but you can build some decent scale and ... at the same time have a real impact on people 's lives			0

in @entity18 , @entity1 's *drastic* housing shortages are *exploding* into *violence*
@entity20 , founder of construction firm @entity21 , thinks he has the answer
@entity107 builds traditional houses fast , and sells direct to buyers
