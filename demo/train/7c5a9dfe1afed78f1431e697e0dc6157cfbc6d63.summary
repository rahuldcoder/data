-- dr @entity1 , president of the @entity2 , tells @entity0 about the day that the earthquake struck , the devastating aftermath and his hope for the future of soccer in the country			1
what happened on the day of the earthquake ? i went to the federation around 1pm to meet the president of the women 's league and the members of the commission of the league - we had to discuss a lot of matters			1
also present at the meeting were @entity22 ( wife of the minister of sports and the @entity26 president ) and the national head coach @entity27			1
the meeting was over and i was getting ready to leave when i felt the house shaking			2
i ran towards the back exit of the house			2
while going downstairs it was shaking really badly , i lost my balance and fell and blocks of debris fell on my hand			2
i got up and fell again with a huge amount of debris falling on my body			2
i was scared but i got up again to move away from the house that i then saw collapse in a white cloud			2
with the few that were able to escape this tragedy , and also the friends of the football family , we started helping people trapped under the rubble			2
during the whole night , even in darkness and with their lives in danger , those young friends of football saved and removed a few injured colleagues under the rubble			1
unfortunately , more than 30 perished and even more saddening , we were not able to recover their body for days			1
every day we go to the ruins of our office , and we had a memorial ceremony for all our colleagues that perished			2
we were helpless , beside three cases , to remove their bodies and return them to their families			2
what was going through your mind after the earthquake ? i had many thoughts going through my head for many days after and not having communication , we were unable to obtain information			1
when some friends were able to recover my @entity77 , i started working and trying to reorganize			2
i started by contacting the parents of the young boys and girls , miraculously saved because they were practicing at the @entity81 , and helped those that were in need			2
i was also deeply in pain with my injuries and the loss of some of my family			2
psychologically , i had a lot of questions			2
what was left of the @entity2 ? from the headquarters there was nothing left			1
all our office equipment , all of what we were able to acquire throughout the years in order to put together a decent office - our efforts to have a nice archive , our trophies and distinctions during the last years - we lost everything			2
but most of all we lost a lot of colleagues including our best coach for the past years , all the equipment of our national teams , thousands of balls recently purchased everything ... everything			2
how did you cope in those days after the earthquake ? it 's hard to adapt yourself to this , it 's a whole different ball game			1
i did not have any meds and my injured fingers started to get infected			1
we were sleeping on the ground with the mosquitoes , the wind , the cold and the loud noises of airplanes coming in and out of the airport			2
fortunately some colleagues were able to recover my @entity77 -- it was damaged but functional			2
we were able to get together , us members of the federation , and we all did our best to get back to work progressively			1
my kids were fabulous - they were able to send me meds , tents , sleeping bags and some money to cover every day expenses			0
physically things got better but it has been a horrible misery up to now			0
what help did you receive from your neighboring countries and from @entity142 itself ? the support we received was the most comforting			1
less than four days after the earthquake , captain @entity145 , the president of the @entity146 , arrived in two helicopters sent by the presidents of @entity142 & @entity150			1
we accompanied him on a small tour of the town and met leaders in the stadium and on the ruins of our headquarters			0
the very emotional report that he wrote touched the world football family even more on the hugeness of the tragedy			0
the president of the @entity163 sent colleagues to check on us and find out about our needs			1
he also sent me some meds that were very precious			0
president @entity168 and a lot of his colleagues called me and assured me that we were not alone			1
about two weeks ago , with a lot of difficulties , @entity142 vice-president @entity171 made it to @entity175 in a private plane and brought us meds , foods and water			1
he promised to motivate the @entity142 committee about our needs , promised that @entity142 would help our national teams to keep competing , all in all helping us rebuild our soccer			1
at @entity142 , last tuesday , during the meeting of the associations , a lot of presidents of @entity185 were present			1
a minute 's silence was observed for all the victims of the earthquake and during a special meeting , president @entity168 announced to me that a special fund was created for the reconstruction of our football			1
@entity142 experts will come to @entity196 soon to evaluate our needs , build projects that @entity142 will finance from this newly created fund			1
this is a big solidarity move			0
on february 26 with the help of the @entity202 government we will play a charity game in @entity204			0
on march 7th , with the help of a @entity209 tv station , our men 's national team will play a game to raise funds that will be used to rebuild the stadium of @entity213 that was completely destroyed			1
some former world athletes have agreed to participate in this game			0
the @entity209 have already visited this stadium and plan to help us for a while with this project			0
soccer federations of the whole world - @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 -- offered their help and we are deeply touched by this move			0
how many of @entity196 's players were affected by the earthquake ? the number of dead and injured announced , is really , really far from reality			1
the very bad construction of the country , the lack of organization in general , the fact that the first response help got on the ground days after , will make the final numbers very high , higher than the official numbers given			0
fortunately with the fact the earthquake happened at 4:53pm , the players of @entity241 and 2 were unharmed			1
the players lost immediate families : parents , wives , children			0
a lot of young players are orphans			0
when communication is fully restored and obviously when teams start training again , we will have an idea but the numbers will never be exact			0
how does @entity196 as a country feel about football ? there is not one @entity196 that has not touched a soccer ball			1
football is part of the everyday life of @entity196 , even with the scary living conditions in @entity175 , even with the fields being occupied , they still play soccer			1
it is the only entertainment reserved for everybody			0
at the federation we had the great idea of distributing in the temporary shelters the few soccer balls we were able to recover and it was an explosion of joy			1
i think it is necessary and mandatory , to help with the psychological recovery of a major part of the population , to free the fields and allow the people to release some stress			0
in times of crisis like this does it help having something like football help to focus you ? it is a big challenge that motivates us better , gives us the desire to live			0
my biggest objective is for the soccer family to become more united every day , because until recently the soccer family was disunited			0
we feel that we have more responsibility than before			0
with all this solidarity coming from all around the world , with the situation of the youth , with this cruel misery and this sudden loss for everybody , we feel that soccer has an important role to play in the reconstruction of this country			0
how will you rebuild the federation and how long will it take ? it will be difficult - the conditions are impossible for us			1
my colleagues at the federation are aware that every time we try to restart the soccer world in @entity196 an unfortunate situation puts us back to square one			1
in 2003 we had to stop everything during a political crisis			0
in 2003 we had @entity317			0
in 2005 there was the security crisis with the departure of president @entity321			1
in 2008 there were the four hurricanes of the summer			0
every time it is an exodus of talent , the loss of the buying power of the population and each time we have to start from scratch			0
fortunately with new players , the work that we maintain with the young players , with the heavy support of @entity142 , we climbed back up the ladder because in all age categories our teams are some of the best in the region			1
do you think the federation will grow strong again in the future ? i want to talk about construction and reconstruction at the same time			1
@entity196 soccer has existed for more than 100 years			1
soccer is a tradition deeply involved in the culture , the life of the country			0
the misery of the country affected its international evolvement but not its creativity , its popularity , its power and national weight			0
in this domain , with no doubt , everything exists , we will have to motivate - sensibly , because the human factor exists - in order to create an elite of players , to allow young talents to use soccer to get out of the misery , with the goal of obtaining a major professional contract and bringing money back to the country , or attending school abroad			0
we need to take charge of the most talented and ask for the resources that we need			0
we ask for infrastructures in the reconstruction process that the government will start to put at the service of these young talents and sports associations			0
the @entity381 countries insisted on sports infrastructures that did n't exist for the youth			0
@entity142 will help to rebuild our headquarters			1
it should be a reality before the end of this year			0
for the destroyed fields at @entity390 and @entity391 , this should not take time			0
destroyed or not by the earthquake , all the soccer fields are only by name , all of them need to be rebuilt because they were n't really existent before			2
with the lack of resources we had in the past we were able to accomplish so much , now with all the support that we will get , we will come back stronger than before .			0
