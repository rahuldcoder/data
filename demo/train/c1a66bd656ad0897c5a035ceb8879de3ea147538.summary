after a surge of violent attacks in the @entity35 in august , @entity2 's interior minister blamed the tunnels , citing them as smuggling routes for terrorists and weapons			2
bulldozers and cranes were sent to block the tunnels on the @entity2 side as @entity2 's military leadership accused dozens of militants from terrorist factions in @entity6 of carrying out a deadly attack on soldiers near the @entity78 border crossing			2
but smuggling through the tunnels has continued , with goods like cement , sugar and clothes slipping through			0
@entity85 and @entity45 officials say that @entity86 has used the tunnels to send arms and missile parts into @entity6			0
