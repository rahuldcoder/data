it broke me open in a way i still ca n't fully explain , " @entity2 writes in @entity15			1
" but if these little girls were living their lives with joy and happiness , i realized â € ” and if they could give their love to me after all they had been through â € ” how could i possibly feel sorry for myself ? what they showed me was that what had happened to them had just happened			0
it was n't ' done ' to them , just as none of this had been ' done ' to me			0
i was n't being punished ; i had not been singled out			0
