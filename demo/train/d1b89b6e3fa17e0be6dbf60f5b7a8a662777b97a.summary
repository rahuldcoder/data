-- your nana 's collection of figurines			1
the treadmill from your days as a runner			2
that unfinished five - year quilting project			1
as spring - cleaning season kicks in , you 're inspired to chuck anything that is n't being put to good use			1
but then you falter , since getting rid of stuff can be an emotionally charged process			1
@entity0 : spring cleaning to - do list : the 12 things you need to clean " a lot of us hold on to items not because we love them or they 're useful , but because we 're living in the past or for the future , " says @entity20 , an assistant professor at @entity21 who studies people 's relationships with things			1
indeed , a lot of us have a hard time letting go , if the 2.3 billion square feet -- or 82.5 square miles -- of self - storage units in the @entity31 is any indication			2
( never mind what 's crammed under our beds			1
) for the estimated 2 to 5 % of @entity31 who suffer from hoarding , a mental disorder often related to depression and anxiety , this is a problem that interferes with daily life			0

regardless of the degree of clutter in your home , experts agree there are ways to clear it once and for all			0
psychoanalyze your stuff " there has not been much research into why we form these attachments to objects , psychologically , but most of us form them , " says @entity57 , dean of social work at @entity59 and coauthor of several books on hoarding			1
she says that most people store stuff for a handful of reasons : " sometimes it 's just simple joy or aesthetics -- there 's pleasure in seeing an object -- but often nostalgia , guilt and anxiety play a role			1
" @entity0 : 19 tips for perfect laundry every time @entity57 suggests examining your reasons for keeping an item : " do you use it or not ? if not , is it something of beauty ? or is there another reason you 're holding on to it ? " she asks			1
" often people pile the reasons on top of each other -- it was mom 's juicer , and it still works , and besides , that orange color is kind of nice			1
" if you find yourself struggling for justifications , or realize you still have an item out of obligation more than anything else , it may be time to let it go			0
professional organizer @entity112 suggests considering whether your attachment is overblown : " an item might be something an aunt bought ages ago for 20 cents , and people think , ' oh , i ca n't get rid of it			2
' when really your aunt would n't care if you got rid of that candy dish			0
" @entity122 also says to take a hard look at items you 're retaining for practical reasons -- a box of dvds , say -- and think about what will happen if you get rid of it but wind up needing it later			1

" talking about the items helps you make rational decisions , " she says			0
" telling stories can help you let the items go			0
" finding objects a good home can also serve as an emotional cushion -- giving that volume of art books to a school library is less wasteful and traumatic than leaving them at the curb			2
" the good feeling that comes from donating helps counter any guilt , " says @entity57			0
to purge thoughtfully , do n't expect to clear everything out in a weekend			0
" a lot of folks get motivated , then lose steam -- and now they 've made an even bigger mess , because they 've pulled out half the closet 's contents , " says @entity20			1
she suggests setting manageable goals , like one shelf per weekend			2
save space for sentimentality remember , " you are not a robot , " says @entity140			0
despite being a professional organizer , she keeps sentimental items herself -- a pair of scissors from camp when she was 16 years old , for instance			1
" scissors are n't a distraction from the life i want to lead , " she says , " but a large box crammed with trinkets from that same summer would be clutter			2
" setting physical parameters -- one box per year of your kids ' childhood , for example -- helps you zero in on what matters most			1
@entity122 advises saving these things in a way that honors their importance -- labeled and well - wrapped			0
then revisit them periodically to see if your feelings have changed			0

" you have more space for the life you want -- physically in your home , but also mentally			0
" @entity20 remembers when an older client finally acknowledged that she was never going to make beaded jewelry again and got rid of her supplies			0
instead of mourning the end of a longtime hobby , she saw off - loading those supplies " as a fresh opportunity to do something new , " says @entity20			0
" she told me , ' there 's a time when you have to hang up your spurs			2
' " @entity0 : top 50 everyday money - saving tips decluttering the digital way if there are items you want to keep -- but rarely need to look at -- consider these electronic options			0
photographs you 're better off scanning old prints than letting them disintegrate in a box			1
take them to a professional photo shop , or scan them onto your phone with an app like @entity238 's @entity237			1
as you take new photos , avoid another pileup by creating digital folders , organized by month or occasion , says @entity122			0
" i also tell clients to stop printing photos unless they 're being framed , " she adds			2
children 's artwork like many parents , @entity140 , a mother of two , has a hard time parting with her kids ' artwork			1
her process : collect the items in a bin , and comb through it once a year , since identifying the keepers is easier with some distance			2
put a few favorites in a portfolio , and photograph the rest for a digital gallery			0
send almost - keepers to relatives and the rest to the recycling bin			0
( @entity140 even has her husband take the bin to the curb			0
) books yes , books bring warmth to a room , but " when they no longer fit on the shelves , they 're a problem , " says @entity122			1
" only keep books you truly love , and purge the ones you did n't enjoy or will never read again			0
" if you 're on the fence about getting rid of a book , check if it 's available as an e-book or still in print ( most kids ' classics never go out of print )			1
keepsakes photograph knickknacks , toys and other sentimental things before parting ways with them , suggests @entity140			2
take it a step further by creating a photo book on a site like @entity297 and enlisting family members to share memories in the captions			0
you can also print the photo and frame it to keep the item around the house while reducing its footprint -- with the right @entity307 filter , that old mixer or ragged teddy bear can become a work of art. what have you kept and what have you tossed ? share your experience in the comments , on @entity317 or on @entity319 's facebook page .			2

having trouble tossing something with sentimental value ? you 're not alone
professional organizers suggest *re-homing* objects or analyzing why you 've kept them
try setting physical parameters , like one box of your child 's artwork per year
