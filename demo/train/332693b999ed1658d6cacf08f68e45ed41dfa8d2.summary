doctors there removed dead skin and tissue from her legs and she was put on a ventilator , he said			1
@entity17 is a nurse and paramedic ; her husband is a firefighter			1
the twins are healthy , he said			1
a two - hour drive south of @entity9 , in @entity52 , @entity53 , 24 - year - old @entity50 was battling similarly aggressive bacteria on thursday			0
