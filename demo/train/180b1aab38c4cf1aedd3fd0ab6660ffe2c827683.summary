-- the trains that crashed on the @entity2 depended on a 33 - year - old automated control system widely used in cities across the @entity5 , according to the @entity6			1
investigators work at the site where a @entity2 train crashed into the rear of another train			1
but public transit officials say a crash like the one in @entity14 is unlikely to happen in other cities that rely on a similar automated system , including @entity17 , @entity18 ; @entity19 , @entity20 ; @entity21 , @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity24 ; and @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity19 , @entity20 's @entity27 is the only other rail system that uses as much automation as @entity14 's , association officials said			1
transit officials across the country are reassuring passengers who use the subway and light - rail systems in other major cities that the computerized system is safe and is less prone to human error			2
" public transportation is one of the safest ways to travel and what happened in @entity14 is rare , " said @entity39 , a spokeswoman at the @entity6			1
investigators still do n't know the cause of monday 's deadly @entity14 crash , but @entity48 officials are looking into why the computerized emergency system failed to prevent the accident			1
about 5 p.m. monday , two trains crashed on the packed @entity52 near @entity53 , @entity54			0
the accident , the deadliest crash in the @entity2 's 33 - year history , killed nine and injured at least 76 others			2
@entity14 's rapid transit system , known as the @entity2 , is the second - busiest urban rail system in the country following the @entity63 's subway system , according to the transportation association			1
both trains in the @entity2 crash were being operated on automatic mode , which meant the computerized system was supposed to determine if conditions on the track were safe for travel			1
metro trains are operated on automatic mode during rush hour			0
the @entity2 has used the automated system since its inception in 1976			1
similar automated systems have existed in rapid - rail systems in various cities across the @entity5 and abroad for more than 30 years			2
the idea of an automated train control system has n't changed much , but the hardware and technology in the control rooms have been improved			1
" it fundamentally works , " said @entity85 , chief engineer at the transportation association			0
" it 's a very efficient system			0
just because it was designed 30 years ago does n't mean it 's not a good system			0
" there is no federal agency that mandates technology standards for rapid transit systems			0
the standards are regulated by local jurisdictions			0
in an automated system , a control room houses electronics that regulate the movement of trains			1
the control rooms send electronic signals to sensor - like devices located between the train tracks			2
when a train crosses over one of these devices , the device relays critical information to the train 's lead car , telling the train when to slow down , speed up and stop			0
when trains are running on automatic mode , the operator 's main task is to open and close the train doors			2
" the design of the system is set up to keep trains separated , to have positive separation between trains , to control speeds , to give them speed information			1
and so what we 're trying to figure out is what happened in this accident , " @entity48 member @entity126 told @entity0 's " @entity131 " on wednesday			0
the automated system includes safeguards for the train operator , including an emergency , or mushroom - shaped , brake which can be applied when the train is running both in manual and automatic mode			1
@entity48 officials say the train operator appeared to hit the " mushroom " brake before the crash			0
on wednesday , however , @entity48 investigators discovered " anomalies " in an essential control circuit on a section of track where the accident occurred			1
@entity126 said the circuits are " vital providing information to the operators and the train itself when on automatic			2
" @entity48 officials would n't elaborate on the " anomalies			0
" a full @entity48 report of the investigation wo n't be released until six to 18 months from now , but officials said they will simulate crash tests to determine what caused the accident			0
until the report is released , transit authorities say they wo n't be likely to know what improvements or changes need to be made in other urban rail systems			0
last year , a commuter rail crash in @entity170 , @entity20 , that killed 25 people prompted federal and state officials to aggressively upgrade safety systems on inter-city railways and commuter rails across the country			0
metro trains in @entity14 are being operated manually by train operators until further notice , according to the @entity180			1
in a manual system , the train operator has full control of the train 's starts , stops and speed			1
the operator must drive within speed parameters set by the signals , or the train will shut down			0
the @entity2 's only other fatal crash occurred in january 1982 when three people died as a result of a derailment between the @entity196 and @entity198 stations , according to @entity2 officials			2
data from the @entity201 in 2008 shows drivers on roads are 14 times more likely to end up in a fatal accident than people who ride public transit			0
officials in other cities that rely on automated rapid - transit systems similar to @entity14 's @entity2 say they believe their trains are safe			1
@entity212 , a spokeswoman for the @entity213 , said the automated system has worked for passengers in that @entity217 city , citing no major accidents in recent years			2
she said the @entity220 system , which is the third busiest system in the @entity5 , has operators on board each train			2
" the automatic system we use works for us , so we 're not going to look at new technology that does n't prove to be cost effective , " she said			0
in @entity17 , @entity18 , officials at the @entity229 reassured passengers through the media that their automatic system , though similar to @entity14 's , is safe and has back - up emergency brakes			1
@entity234 , assistant general manager and chief engineer at the @entity18 authority , said the agency spent more than $ 200 million over the last decade to ensure the " signal and control systems are as modern and safe as they can be			0
" @entity240 , a spokesman at the authority , said he has n't heard any passenger concerns about safety or made any changes with how their trains operate since monday 's @entity2 crash			2
" we 're confident in our system as it is now , " @entity240 said .			0

the @entity2 has used an automated train control system since 1976
@entity17 , @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity25 also use a similar system
@entity6 : " what happened in @entity14 is rare "
investigators found a *problem* in one of the track circuits that relay data to trains
