@entity0 -- @entity3 troops fired on protesters trying to cross the fortified border between @entity6 and the occupied @entity0 on sunday , with @entity6 authorities reporting more than a dozen dead and hundreds wounded			1
the protests came on the anniversary of the 1967 @entity11 , when @entity3 captured the @entity0 from @entity6			1
the @entity12 did not immediately confirm any casualties , though a spokeswoman said that @entity3 troops used tear gas and live ammunition on members of an " angered mob			1
" " we warned them verbally ( and ) with warning shots into the air , " lt. col. @entity19 told @entity1			0
" and when these two options failed , we had to open fire selectively into the area , and this actually stopped those @entity6 from reaching the @entity3 - @entity6 fence			1
" the @entity6 state news agency said 23 people were killed and more than 350 wounded in the protests , which continued past nightfall			1
medics could be seen carrying the wounded to vehicles and driving them away from the border			0
a spokesman for @entity39 secretary general ban ki - moon condemned the violence and urged restraint			1
" the events of today and of 15 may on the @entity0 put the long - held cease - fire in jeopardy			0
the @entity46 calls for maximum restraint on all sides and strict observance of international humanitarian law to ensure protection of civilians , " he said			0
as many as 500 people took part in the demonstration , holding mid-day prayers on the @entity6 side of the border , then crouching down behind ramparts that @entity3 constructed in response to similar demonstrations three weeks ago			1
the number later dropped to about 50 , with protesters waving @entity64 and @entity6 flags			2
clashes also broke out between @entity64 and @entity3 at the @entity67 crossing between @entity68 and @entity69 in the @entity70 on sunday			1
at least six @entity64 were injured there , one seriously , by rubber bullets			2
@entity3 forces also fired tear gas , while @entity64 threw stones			2
the clashes come three weeks after similar demonstrations marking the 1948 birth of the jewish state -- a day of mourning for @entity64 , more than 700,000 of whom were displaced from their homes during the fighting that followed			0
those protests left at least 12 dead			0
@entity19 accused @entity6 of trying to use the protests to create a diversion " from the bloodshed that is taking place inside @entity6 , " where the @entity39 says a crackdown against anti-government protests has left more than 1,000 dead			2
" there is no question about it , " she said			0
" the policemen , the armed @entity6 forces are looking back and not doing anything			0
" demonstrators arrived in at least eight buses before the protest began , then came down from a hill known locally as " @entity101 " -- where people shout to family and friends on the other side of the border -- toward the ramparts @entity3 forces constructed last month			1
@entity19 said @entity3 troops were better prepared to deal with the demonstrations than with the may 15 protests , beefing up forces along the frontier and making clear " that we would not tolerate any infiltration into the @entity3 side			0
" @entity1 's @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
