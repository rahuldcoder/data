a federal judge monday blocked one of the most well - known tools used to crack down on illegal immigration by the man who calls himself @entity7 's toughest sheriff			1
@entity10 sheriff @entity9 must stop enforcing @entity11 's identify theft laws , @entity7 district judge @entity8 ruled monday , granting a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against @entity9			1
the lawsuit , filed by the @entity17 immigrant rights group , argues that the laws are unconstitutional and have been used by @entity9 and his office to target undocumented immigrants in workplace raids			1
@entity9 's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment			2
in the past , he 's defended the workplace raids and said his department has been forced to step in because federal authorities have n't done enough to enforce immigration laws			1
@entity8 said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that the state 's identify theft laws are preempted by federal laws , and that @entity9 must stop enforcing the laws until a final decision is reached in the lawsuit			1
@entity37 , executive director of @entity17 , described the judge 's ruling monday as an " enormous victory			0
" " @entity9 and ( @entity43 ) @entity42 are being stripped of the tools they use to illegally terrorize immigrant workers and families , " he said in a statement			0
" we hope that justice will continue to prevail , that not one more worker is arrested for providing for his or her family and that the racist , anti-immigrant machine for which @entity11 is known is dismantled completely			0
" @entity9 's tough , headline - grabbing punishments have earned him diehard supporters and fiery opponents			0
he 's issued pink underwear to the men detained in the county 's jails and said he is saving taxpayers money by removing salt and pepper from prison meals			0
last year , he said inmates who allegedly defaced @entity7 flags placed in their jail cells would be punished with a diet of bread and water			0
in 2013 , a federal court in @entity72 ruled that @entity9 's handling of people of @entity76 descent was not tough enforcement of immigration laws but instead amounted to racial and ethnic profiling			2
the judge later ordered a federal monitor to keep tabs on @entity9 's office and make sure officers were n't racially profiling anymore			1
last year , he filed a lawsuit against @entity7 president @entity87 over his executive actions on immigration			0
but a judge dismissed @entity9 's lawsuit in december , ruling that @entity9 did n't have standing to bring the lawsuit and could n't show he 'd been harmed by @entity87 's changes			2
in a court filing last month , @entity9 said he was disbanding his office 's criminal employment unit , the squad that conducted the workplace raids , because federal court decisions had already blocked certain @entity11 laws			1
@entity0 's @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and contributed to this report .			0

a federal judge rules that sheriff @entity9 ca n't enforce his state 's identity theft laws
the laws are likely *trumped* by federal laws , the judge rules
@entity9 has used the laws to justify workplace raids
