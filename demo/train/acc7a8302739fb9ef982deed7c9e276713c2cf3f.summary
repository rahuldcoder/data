wednesday 's attack in @entity2 was not the first attack on the offices of @entity5 , nor the first terror attack planned against a @entity8 publication			1
but it was by far the most lethal act of terrorism to target the media in modern @entity8			2
it raises many troubling questions for the future of a free press , unhindered in its reporting by fear			1
and it will reopen the debate on where freedom of speech becomes incitement and where restraint equals self - censorship			1
@entity5 has published many cartoons lampooning @entity28 extremism and , more recently , the @entity29 in @entity30 and @entity31			1
one recent cartoon featured @entity34 ' leader @entity33			1
under editor @entity36 , who was among those killed wednesday , it has been one of several @entity8 publications to make a point of taking on extremism and religious intolerance -- knowing it risked deadly consequences			1
even when these publications have come under attack , they have continued plowing a lonely and provocative furrow			1
@entity5 's offices were destroyed by a gasoline bomb in 2011 after the magazine carried a caricature of the @entity51 on the cover , saying " 100 lashes if you are not dying of laughter			1
" a cartoon inside showed the prophet with a clown 's nose			2
it also announced he would be editor - in - chief of the next edition			1
no one was hurt in that attack			1
depiction of the prophet is prohibited in @entity67 and , along with desecration of the @entity69 , enrages jihadists even more than images of prison abuse or airstrikes -- precisely because it is aimed directly at the prophet and the holy book			1
@entity36 said at the time of the 2011 attack that it was the work of " idiot extremists " and insisted the magazine had the right to poke fun at anything			1
and then - @entity85 prime minister @entity84 said at the time : " freedom of expression is an inalienable right in our democracy and all attacks on the @entity92 must be condemned with the greatest firmness			1
" but wednesday 's attack shows that condemnation and round - the - clock protection of the media are two entirely different things			1
there was a regular police presence at the offices of @entity5 , but the officers appear to have been as much a target as the journalists -- an easy , static target for a well - organized attack			1
and what organizations merit protection ? in the aftermath of wednesday 's attack , @entity85 prime minister @entity109 announced that " media organizations , major stores , religious places and public transport ( in the @entity2 area ) will be provided with reinforced security			2
" it is the obvious response , but some would argue that this is just what terrorists want : a climate of fear			2
in february 2006 , @entity5 reprinted cartoons of the prophet that had first appeared in the @entity126 newspaper @entity125 , itself the target of several plots by @entity28 extremists			2
the magazine said it was reprinting the cartoons in support of press freedom , but then - @entity85 president @entity134 criticized the decision as " overt provocation			1
" the editor of another @entity85 newspaper was fired for reprinting the cartoons			0
@entity5 was also taken to court by two @entity67 groups in @entity85 but acquitted of incitement to racism			1
the court decided there had been no " deliberate intention of directly and gratuitously offending the @entity148 community			0
" @entity5 : satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy that case encapsulated the dilemma for governments and the media in @entity8			2
when does the exercise of free speech become incitement , provocation or an act of racism ? and is self - censorship necessary in a multicultural society where restraint helps social peace and provocation can bring violence ? the original publication of the cartoons in @entity125 in september 2005 caused riots across the @entity148 world in which an estimated 130 people were killed			1
the newspaper received more than 100 death threats			0
@entity174 , the culture editor of the newspaper , later published an article in the @entity177 entitled " why i published those cartoons , " which is worth quoting at length : " i commissioned the cartoons in response to several incidents of self - censorship in @entity8 caused by widening fears and feelings of intimidation in dealing with issues related to @entity67			1
... the idea was n't to provoke gratuitously -- and we certainly did n't intend to trigger violent demonstrations throughout the @entity148 world			0
our goal was simply to push back self - imposed limits on expression that seemed to be closing in tighter			2
" he gave an example , saying one @entity126 comedian had told @entity125 that he had no problem urinating on the @entity198 in front of a camera , but he dared not do the same thing with the @entity69			0
the @entity202 in @entity203 had confronted the same dilemma -- withdrawing a work called " @entity207 is great " by @entity206 which depicted torn images of the @entity198 , the @entity69 and the @entity209			0
the @entity202 said that in the wake of the july 2005 bombings , displaying the work would " not be appropriate			0
" some have argued that restraint shows respect and is not cowing to extremism			1
as archbishop of @entity219 , @entity217 argued in 2008 for stronger measures against incitement of religious hatred , saying that the " sound of a prosperous and socially secure voice claiming unlimited freedom both to define and to condemn the beliefs of a minority grates on the ear			2
" there are also some who see the publication of provocative images as a cheap way to publicity			0
the critic @entity235 wrote in the @entity236 at the height of the cartoon controversy that " modern artists and their promoters forever pander to a like - minded audience by goading obvious targets , hoping to incite reactions that pass for political point - scoring			2
" if anything , the atmosphere in @entity8 is now more combustible than it was in 2006			0
recession has brought unemployment -- in @entity85 it is rising fast -- and with it , less tolerance for immigration and minorities , even when they are well established			0
the anti-immigrant @entity254 in @entity85 topped the poll in last year 's elections to the @entity257			0
in the @entity260 , the anti-europe and anti-immigration party @entity258 has made spectacular gains in by - elections			2
and in @entity263 , a group calling itself @entity265 -- patriotic @entity8 against the @entity266 -- drew nearly 20,000 people to a recent rally in @entity269			0
despite condemnation from chancellor @entity271 as well as @entity263 business and labor unions , @entity265 continues undaunted to challenge the establishment			0
at the same time , the rise of @entity28 militancy has seeped into many of the @entity148 immigrant communities that have grown across @entity8 in the last generation			0
@entity285 , with few prospects and often alienated by what they perceive as victimization by police , are vulnerable to recruitment by extremists			0
several thousand from across @entity8 have already gone to @entity31 and @entity30 , many to fight for jihadist groups such as @entity34 and @entity290			1
the @entity85 @entity291 estimates that hundreds of @entity85 citizens have left or plan to leave to join the ranks of jihadist groups in @entity31 or @entity30			0
a video released by @entity34 in november showed three @entity85 jihadists calling on other @entity85 @entity285 to join the fight or carry out attacks in @entity85			1
one of the fighters said : " terrorize them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror			0
there are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit			0
even poison is available , so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of @entity312			0
kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars			2
" others have already come back from @entity31 and @entity30			0
one was arrested and charged in the gun attack on a @entity324 museum in @entity325 last year ; another was detained in the south of @entity85 after bomb - making equipment was found in his apartment			1
@entity85 and @entity260 have introduced tougher anti-terrorism laws that allow for the confiscation of passports of those suspected of intending to travel to @entity31 and @entity30 to join militant groups			0
but a free society does n't have the resources , the laws or even perhaps the will to track all such individuals			0
ultimately , journalists who want to publish material that 's clearly offensive or inflammatory to some will have to accept the inherent risks in this new environment			2
some , like @entity174 at @entity125 , accept that			0
" if a believer demands that i , as a nonbeliever , observe his taboos in the public domain , he is not asking for my respect , but for my submission			1
and that is incompatible with a secular democracy , " he wrote .			0

gunmen kill journalists at magazine that lampooned @entity67 extremism , @entity34
attack raises questions about where @entity92 becomes incitement
is restraint self - censorship and submission , or a show of respect ?
