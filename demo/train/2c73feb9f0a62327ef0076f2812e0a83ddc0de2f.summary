-- @entity1 has not held golf 's no. 1 ranking since october 2010 , but he is now within touching distance of adding to his record 623 weeks at the top			1
the 14 - time major champion can topple @entity8 by winning the @entity10 - @entity11 tournament for the eighth time as long as the @entity13 finishes no higher than third come sunday			1
" it would be nice to get back there because obviously it meant that as far as i had dropped , to build my way back up to this point , i 've had some wins , i 've had some very high finishes , i 've been consistent , " said @entity1 , who dropped as low as 58th following his well - publicized divorce and injury problems			1
" that 's how you get to be one of the top players in the world			2
to be ranked as low as i did and then come all the way back to , as of right now , no. 2 , that 's pretty good			1
" @entity1 has finished tied for 40th , 21st and third in the three majors ahead of this season 's final one -- next week 's @entity35 at @entity36			2
@entity38 's collapse hands @entity40 crown to @entity41 he tops the @entity44 's @entity43 standings after three tournament victories which have taken him to second on the all - time list with 74			1
he is the only three - time winner on the @entity49 circuit , but will be teeing off at @entity50 on thursday with @entity52 's @entity51 -- the only player on the @entity53 with a hat - trick of victories in 2012			1
" i feel very comfortable where i am at because everything is progressing , " @entity1 said on the @entity44 website			1
" this year i 've taken the steps headed in the right direction and shot better scores and been more consistent			0
" when you make changes like i 've made in my game , it takes a little bit of time , and things are starting to click in now			0
and to have three wins this year , it 's headed in the right direction			0
" woods pulled out of the final round of the last @entity10 event , the @entity70 in march , but has since put his injuries behind him			2
" it 's nice knowing that we have a big event with the best players in the world here right before a major championship , " the 36 - year - old said			1
" this will be a nice way to get our games ready for obviously next week but also really test us at the same time			0
having back - to - back championships like this , it 's a positive thing			0
" @entity8 has held the no. 1 ranking for 55 weeks across four different stints , but is still seeking his first major title			1
" i 'm certainly very proud of my no. 1 ranking and how long i 've kept it , " the 34 - year - old said			2
" that shows how consistent i 've been over the last couple years , and i 'll continue to try and work on accomplishing a lot more in this game			0
" and if i keep doing what i know i can do , winning more tournaments and hopefully winning majors , then hopefully i can stay there			0
" but obviously i 've got a lot of great players behind me , including @entity1			0
it 's good to have guys like that chomping at your heel			0
they push you to work harder , to challenge yourself to try and get to that next level			0

world no. 2 @entity1 has @entity8 in his sights at @entity11
@entity49 will return to top if he wins the @entity44 event for the eighth time
woods dropped as low as 58th but third place at @entity40 continued his steady *resurgence*
he will be playing *alongside* the only other three - time winner of 2012 , @entity51
