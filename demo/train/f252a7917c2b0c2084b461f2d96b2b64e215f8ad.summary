-- how is new ceo @entity1 going to revitalize @entity2 ? by making it more like @entity5 , the company she just left			1
according to @entity8 's @entity7 , @entity6 has instituted a few changes already at @entity2 's @entity10 , @entity11 , headquarters			2
among them : establishing a weekly all - hands meeting on friday afternoons , and making all the food in its @entity15 , which previously priced egg white muffin sandwiches at $ 3.65 and teriyaki chicken paninis at $ 5.31 , free			1
of course , it 's easy to say that all of this has been borrowed directly from @entity5 , but these kinds of offerings have become standard at many @entity24 offices â € ” the fact that @entity2 has , until now , lacked them has likely been a sore point for some of its engineers			2
both @entity31 and @entity32 , for instance , serve up free snacks and daily catered meals to employees			1
they 're small changes , yes , but they 're likely to improve the morale of a company whose public image and internal image has deteriorated over the last seven years			0
in addition to the new meeting and food policy , @entity7 reports that @entity6 is also planning " major changes " to workspaces " to make [ them ] more collaborative and cool , " and improving the swag offered in its stores			1
she 's also pushing to improve @entity2 's core products , including e-mail , @entity53 and search			0
several of @entity7 's sources said that " big splash tech or product deals ... perhaps via an acquisition " may be announced " in the days ahead			0
" @entity2 could not be reached for comment			0
