-- in between taking care of their families , working and trying to keep up with everyday life , many @entity1 have caught at least a couple stories about @entity6			1
many probably know that clashes between government forces and protesters who want the country 's president to relinquish power have become increasingly bloody over the past several months			0
much of that violence has been represented in online videos , ostensibly that @entity6 have posted , suggesting the slaughter of children and families			0
no one would argue anything else			0
but there is violence in many corners of the world			0
why should what 's happening in @entity6 be especially important to @entity1 ? it 's clear a lot of people think it 's not			1
several readers reacted to tuesday 's top story on @entity0 about @entity6 by commenting : " zzzzzz not our problem " and " anyone surprised ? * yawn *			2
" " we are afraid to ask this question -- ' why care ? ' -- because it 's like saying we do n't mind that there 's a humanitarian crisis happening or that people are suffering , " said @entity34 , a @entity35 - based professor , blogger and one of the nation 's foremost @entity39 and @entity6 experts			1
she is a former @entity45 adviser to president @entity46 and has interviewed @entity6 president @entity47 for a book about @entity6 authored by her husband , @entity49 , also a @entity39 expert			1
" people have to know it 's allowed to take a discussion beyond the human suffering , " she said			1
" there are huge , practical consequences for the @entity1 when it comes to @entity6			1
" like what ? @entity0 asked @entity34 ; @entity58 , a former @entity1 soldier turned foreign policy analyst ; and @entity60 , a geopolitical strategist with @entity62 experience , to explain why @entity1 should care about @entity6			1
think of @entity6 as the @entity39 's core			1
when it 's weak and destabilized , the body is susceptible to serious injury			0
violence in @entity6 could easily spill into bordering @entity68 , where the @entity1 recently ended a war that ran from march 2003 to december 2011 and where @entity1 troops and @entity1 civilians still work			1
beyond @entity68 , @entity72 , a @entity1 ally , borders @entity6 as do @entity73 and @entity74			1
if @entity74 is shaken too badly by conflict in @entity6 , @entity74 could fall into a civil war as it did decades ago , @entity58 said			2
that kind of conflict would spark yet another serious political and diplomatic problem that the @entity1 would inevitably have to address			2
the @entity1 ' no. 1 enemy would appreciate another failed state from which to operate in the @entity39			1
@entity83 has had a contentious relationship with the @entity1 for decades			1
remember @entity46 's " @entity85 " ? that trifecta was @entity83 , @entity87 and @entity68			0
" @entity6 is @entity83 's arm in the @entity39 , " @entity60 said			1
" @entity83 has used @entity6 as a staging ground to train and support militants who have crossed into @entity68 to hurt our troops and to train for other terrorist activities			2
" each expert @entity0 spoke with pointed out that @entity83 has a nuclear program			0
whether it has capabilities for nuclear weapons is something the @entity1 and most of the world does n't know			0
though @entity6 produces far less oil than @entity104 , for example , violence in @entity6 could affect global oil speculation and prices , @entity49 said			2
ultimately , that affects how much @entity1 consumers pay at the pump			0
@entity49 and @entity60 note that many in the @entity1 may not think about the @entity68 war now , but they say it 's important not to forget that war cost an estimated $ 1 trillion			0
whether one supports or opposes military intervention in @entity6 , the costs incurred by any approach will affect the @entity1 economy			2
" people around the world are looking for some kind of consistency in our foreign policy , and we 've been criticized for not having that , not having anything close to consistency during the @entity131 , " @entity60 said			0
the @entity1 intervened , with @entity132 leading the way , in @entity104			0
in 2011 , @entity35 supported , at least in words , the @entity136 in their revolt against then - @entity136 president @entity138 , he said			0
each time , the @entity1 argued that those actions were in accordance with @entity1 's national values , he said , and its responsibility as a global leader to defend democratic principles .			0

experts : beyond human suffering , @entity6 has practical implications for @entity1
@entity6 is " @entity83 's arm in the @entity39 , " geopolitical strategist says
@entity6 is bordered by countries in which the @entity1 has a *vested* interest
oil prices could be affected by continued conflict in @entity6
