-- like a magician in a blue shirt and white socks , @entity1 stood outside the @entity6 restaurant in @entity7 on july 30 , 1975 , made a phone call , and vanished			1
some people would later say he seemed nervous as he headed to a supposed meeting there with suspected mob bosses			2
some would say they saw a mysterious car leaving the lot			2
but the one question no one has yet answered for investigators is the essential one : where did he go ? now , once again , as they have so many times before , @entity21 agents and other officers are digging			2
once again , the lead has come from someone with ties to organized crime			2
and once again , the target is a nondescript field where @entity1 might ... just might ... be buried			1
all that changes is the details			2
@entity1 still fascinates after 40 years this time the story being told involves @entity1 being beaten with a shovel , and buried alive beneath the concrete slab of a now long - gone barn			1
@entity37 sheriff @entity36 says , " it is my fondest hope that we can give that closure not only to the @entity1 family but also to the community to stop tearing that scab off with every new lead and bring some conclusion			1
" @entity1 's life came to its mysterious conclusion after decades of truly remarkable accomplishments			1
born in @entity50 , he became interested in organized labor as a teenager when he encountered unfair working conditions			2
as he grew into adulthood , he became more assertive about organizing unions , and gradually he became the leader of the @entity58 , transforming that union into a political juggernaut capable of making or breaking candidates			0
on a grainy old piece of film from the @entity66 in 1960 you can still see him in his office near the @entity68 in @entity69			0
he bristles when the reporter asks if he has any hobbies , like golfing			0
" seven days a week , " @entity1 says , " i have more fun here working than anybody can have on a golf course or any sport you can name			1
" @entity1 's bare - knuckled , win - at - all - costs approach to the union business , however , took him down some dark roads			1
he struck deals with organized crime leaders			0
and eventually he was sent to prison			0
in what looked like a sketchy -- if unproven -- deal for political support , president @entity87 pardoned him , and the @entity58 lined up behind @entity87 's successful reelection campaign			1
but even @entity87 's help came with a price : @entity1 was told he had to stay out of the union business			1
still , @entity1 fought to regain his power anyway , and soon a lot of people in a lot of places arguably had reasons to want him gone			1
and ever since , people have looked for him			0
more than a dozen times investigators have followed what are invariably described as " credible " leads to a suspected @entity1 burial site			1
@entity7 has produced the most locations , and @entity104 often refer to them by their distinguishing features , making conversation sound like a list of a @entity109 novels : the @entity110			1
@entity113 , with its long history of @entity115 ( cue the " @entity117 " theme ) has also excited attention in the hunt for @entity1			1
one of the most popular theories is that he was encased in the cement of @entity122			0
and on and on the theories go			0
he was sunk in the swamps of @entity124			0
he was carted off to @entity125			0
he was crushed in a car and shipped overseas with a load of scrap metal			0
sometimes the possibilities seem as endless as the searches			1
all of this is not cheap			0
based on the sticker price of just one search as analyzed by the @entity135 , it is not unreasonable to estimate that police agencies have spent well over $ 3 million trying to find this man			2
or more to the point : his body			0
he was legally declared dead in 1982 , and even if he had been miraculously living incognito in @entity141 all these years , he would be 100 years old			0
strangely , there seems little debate about what most likely happened			0
true crime aficionados and authorities alike have long believed that @entity1 's dreams of a comeback did not sit so well with mobsters who 'd settled into a new routine while @entity1 was away			1
and , they theorize , because he would not go into a quiet retirement , the " muscle " showed up and retired him another way			0
the details are the problem			0
precisely who did it ? precisely how ? police know you ca n't make much of a criminal case based on , " we 're pretty sure he 's dead , and we 're pretty sure it was these guys			0
" @entity1 's family has responded to the latest tip and search as they always do , by suggesting they hope it works			1
but 38 years after the man who was the ruling face of big labor disappeared in the clear light of day , no one has yet been able to throw aside the curtain , untangle the riddle , and declare " we have found him			2
" for now , @entity1 , is still hiding .			1

since @entity1 disappeared on july 30 , 1975 , the mystery has lingered
where did he go ? what -- and who -- was behind the vanishing act
the latest search is on a nondescript field in @entity7
it is just the most recent in a string of searches that stretches across nearly 4 decades
