i obey the speed limit , use turn signals , and do n't cruise around with broken tail lights			2
i do n't have substance - abuse problems , unless you count @entity8			2
i live in a safe neighborhood , and no one in my family has a criminal record			2
i like to think all of that is why i spend virtually no time worrying about the police			1
yet there 's another big reason : i 'm white			2
the way most white people see the police , and the way most black people see them , is separated by a gap so wide it may as well be a canyon			1
that gulf has been cast into sharp relief by events in @entity28 , @entity29 , where a grand jury declined to indict white police officer @entity31 in the death of unarmed black teenager @entity33			1
that sparked protests around the country , as did a decision in @entity38 not to indict a white police officer in the death of @entity41 , an unarmed black man who police confronted while investigating allegations that he was selling cigarettes illegally			1
those cases collectively have come to stand as a kind of national @entity48 inkblot test , with people looking at the same events and reaching different conclusions			2
some people adopted the phrase " black lives matter " to protest police treatment of minorities , while others countered with " police lives matter , " and -- maybe in search of a more universal middle ground -- " all lives matter			1
" people immortalized @entity41 's last words -- " i ca n't breathe " -- on t - shirts and protest signs and social media posts			1
those on the other side of the national divide fired back with slogans such as " i can breathe " and " @entity71 , @entity72 , " arguing that if you just obey the law , you will avoid encounters with the police altogether			1
one of our latest @entity1 / @entity78 polls put numbers on the gap in public opinion			2
asked " how many police officers in the area where you live ... are prejudiced against blacks ? " 17 % of whites said " most or some , " but more than twice as many non-whites -- 42 % -- felt that way			1
" does the @entity91 criminal justice system treat whites and blacks equally ? " whites : 50 % said yes , compared to 21 % of non-whites			1
true , plenty of blacks and whites buck those trends , and no racial group can be treated as a monolith in these matters , but leanings -- writ large -- remain			1
those opinions may grow out of the fact that police tend to arrest blacks at rates disproportionate to their share in the general population			1
@entity111 figures , for example , show that blacks made up 28 % of all people arrested in 2013 ; they make up about 13 % of the @entity91 population			1
but plenty of people have long suggested those numbers are deceiving ; that police pursue black suspects more vigorously because they are predisposed to believe blacks are guilty , and those suspects are often less educated and not as financially prepared to defend themselves			1
the result , they argue , is a self - fulfilling prophecy : a larger percentage of blacks are arrested and convicted because police spend more time chasing them down			1
accordingly , when an unarmed teen gets shot and killed by a cop in @entity29 , or a man in @entity38 dies after being choked by an officer , some people see evidence of police targeting and brutalizing minorities			1
still , facts often fit into this debate like broken @entity135 , if at all			2
in both @entity28 and @entity38 , police supporters point out that the men who died were being approached about possible criminal behavior and did not do what the officers asked of them			1
that 's a formula for trouble , they say , regardless of race			1
want more complications ? consider this : about a quarter of the nation 's officers come from minority groups , and they too are making those arrests that so disturb some people in minority communities			2
that suggests this friction may be partially about black and white , but also tied to a pro-police mentality that sees blue first			1
and by the way , there are still plenty of places like @entity28 where the overwhelming prevalence of white officers in a largely black community creates a feeling of apartheid for some minority residents			2
it all plays out in so many heated ways			0
protestors flood the streets and some observers see overdue demands for change , while others see pointless rabble - rousing and destruction			0
in @entity38 , officers turned their backs on mayor @entity177 on the grounds that he supported protesters outraged by the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer in @entity41 's death			1
anger at the mayor deepened after two @entity38 police officers were killed in ambush by a man who had posted on @entity187 : " i 'm putting wings on @entity189			1
they take 1 of ours , let 's take 2 of @entity193			0
" some see well - founded , fair objections , while others see brazen disrespect			0
on it goes , each action honestly generated from within a worldview , and yet seen in a wildly different way by those who use another lens			0
the divergent views were captured neatly after a @entity205 post from @entity206 , who stars in the @entity1 series " @entity210 ta do it			1
" someone asked what he thought of the protests in @entity214 triggered by events in @entity28			0
he said those protests made him 90 minutes late for a holiday dinner in @entity218 , @entity214 , where the deaths of @entity33 and @entity41 dominated conversation			1
" my conservative friends were focused on the fact that both men died while resisting arrest , and were therefore responsible for their own demise			0
they wanted to discuss the killings in light of the incredible risk that all police officers agree to assume , " @entity206 wrote			1
" my liberal friends were focused on the fact that both men were unarmed , and were therefore victims of excessive force			0
they wanted to discuss the killings in the context of historical trends that suggest bias plays a recurring role in the way cops treat minorities			0
" he said it was clear by dessert that both sides wanted law and order			0
" but the conservatives were convinced that order is only possible when citizens treat cops with respect			0
liberals , on the other hand , were arguing that order can only occur when cops treat everyone the same , " he wrote			0
" and round and round we went			0
" more than 115,000 people offered a range of views in their comments on @entity206 's @entity205 post			1
nearly 65,000 people shared the post , with each spawning more comments from more people with more views			1
when these events happen , people always say " at least we 're talking about the problems			0
" i 'm not so sure			0
i 've covered versions of this debate for close to 40 years now , and it has n't changed much			0
some are so convinced of police bigotry , they will not stomach the slightest allowance that maybe officers are taking on a hard , dangerous job in which judgment calls can be fairly made and still wind up fatally wrong			1
some others are so certain that this is all just so much liberal whining , that they can not tolerate even a reasonable review of police conduct , suggesting that it constitutes an erosion of respect and support for people they consider de facto heroes			2
i suspect if any real progress is to be made in this national discussion , it will have to be started by people who do n't fully buy into either camp			0
and the discussion probably ca n't include poisoning phrases like " black underclass " or " white privilege , " because those are conversation stoppers -- not starters			0
the man who helped me get my first job in television was an excellent investigative journalist named @entity310			0
he made his reputation as a rare @entity313 reporter in @entity314 , @entity315 , grappling with inept public officials , scheming businessmen , and , yes , shady cops			0
he was my friend and mentor			0
one day @entity310 called me aside to criticize a story i 'd just done on divorces , noting that i had not included any black families			0
" this is n't a story about race , " i said			2
" it 's always about race , " @entity310 said			2
" well , i do n't judge people that way			0
" " we all do			0
" i 've thought of that clash many times , especially since @entity310 passed away , and i 've concluded i was right to try to ignore race in a story that was about human values we all share			2
he was equally right to say race has a way of creeping into places where it does n't belong ; like divorces , politics , and police work			1
and we were collectively right in trying to actually talk about our differences , instead of accusing each other and lapsing into hardened silence			0
neither of us was being racist			0
we were trying , as friends do , to help each other understand			0
but then , @entity310 and @entity350 already knew we could trust each other			0
and in too many places , police and the people they are sworn to protect , are not so sure of that .			2

whites and blacks tend to have different views of race and police
that divide has been on display since the deaths of @entity33 and @entity41
some also have a pro-police mentality that sees blue first
