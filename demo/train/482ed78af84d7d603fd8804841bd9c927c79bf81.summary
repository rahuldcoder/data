@entity0 -- like other major financial centers such as @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity5 , @entity0 is home to legions of suited workers toiling long hours in vast , glass towers at breakneck speed			1
but in this crowded , materialistic city , there 's a man trying to build a business from de-stressing the workplace			0
" the wellness of employees is the wellness of the company ; the very strength of a company is its employees , " said @entity15 , a yoga instructor who set up @entity16 -- a company that offers a series of in - office programs to reduce stress			1
he 's on a mission to make yoga mats an essential fixture under every @entity0 worker 's desk			2
the 39 - year old spent 15 years living in @entity32 studying the ancient discipline , which seeks to relax those who practice it , through elongation , slow movement and controlled breathing			1
opportunity when @entity15 moved to @entity0 in october 2011 , opportunity knocked on his door			1
" many of my friends were major company managers and approached me for private ( yoga ) classes , " @entity15 said			1
" after seeing its benefits they thought ' this should come to my company '			0
" within this territory 's constricted work spaces , practicing yoga requires relatively little room and minimal equipment -- a large ball and a mat are enough			2
as the instructor plays calm music , everyone stretches , breathes deeply and closes their eyes			0
" all the team is present at the lessons and it 's a great way to start our day , " said @entity63 , general manager of the @entity65 @entity64 in @entity0 and @entity66			2
this organization has to deal with the day - to - day problems of its member companies and sometimes taking the time to listen can be a challenge , @entity63 told @entity1			0
but performing yoga as a group has helped			0
" we noticed that everyone at the office was more relaxed , and we managed to treat our business partners in a more kind way , " @entity63 added			0
suited and ready the sight of practitioners in their work clothes surrounded by computers and other electronics may seem incongruous with relaxation and meditation , but @entity15 believes yoga performed in his studio is similar to that done in corporate environments -- although people in the workplace may face unique problems			1
for example , students at a studio yoga class may practice over many years , while those in corporate settings may be unfamiliar with the discipline			1
" in an office , maybe people do n't know anything about yoga , " @entity15 told @entity1			1
" they may feel discomfort , frozen shoulders ; we try to release all the tension from the shoulders to give them proper alignment			0
" desk ergonomics are another common focus for yoga classes in offices			1
and the result ? " employees perform better , produce more , and of course , the company has bigger profits , " @entity15 said			2
nevertheless , it can be difficult to inspire managers to interrupt their team 's workday for a few minutes of relaxation			0
" in @entity135 , ( employee wellness ) is still new , it 's growing , " said @entity15 , who believes the region lags behind @entity127 and the @entity128 when it comes to measures that actively help employees find a balance between work and leisure			2
this instructor 's uphill battle goes against @entity135 's economic dynamism			0
an insatiable hunger for ever - larger returns and continuous growth is the new culture of this region , and it seems to have replaced much centuries - old wisdom that teaches spiritual development through balance , meditation and harmony with nature .			0

@entity15 , 39 , teaches yoga classes in a different kind of studio -- the office
he spent 15 years in @entity32 studying yoga before moving to @entity0
corporate wellness is still a developing *concept* in @entity0
managers do n't always see the link between staff well - being and company profits
