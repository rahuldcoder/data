-- @entity2 fighter jets scrambled wednesday to intercept a pair of @entity6 military aircraft that entered their airspace , a fairly routine action that comes amid heightened tensions between @entity6 and @entity11 , a @entity2 official said			1
maj. @entity12 said that the military learned around 3:50 p.m. ( 9:50 a.m. et ) that two @entity6 @entity15 bombers , known as @entity16 , had come a half - mile inside its airspace			1
a pair of @entity2 f - 16 military jets were then dispatched to escort the @entity6 planes and " ensure they ( flew ) out of our airspace , " said @entity12 , a @entity2 military spokesman			1
such a sequence of events is n't uncommon , with the @entity2 military spokesman explaining " this is a national procedure when aircraft infringe ( on ) national @entity2 airspace			1
" he estimated @entity2 fighter jets scramble to check out unknown aircraft -- be they from @entity6 or another country -- about four or five times a year			1
" it is not unusual , " @entity12 added			0
" sometimes they cross @entity2 airspace and sometimes they stay north of @entity2 airspace ( in the country 's so - called area of responsibility )			1
" in this case , @entity42 military aircraft took over from the @entity2 in escorting the @entity6 planes			1
a @entity42 @entity45 spokesman said that planes from his military left from @entity49 station @entity50 " to determine the identity of unknown aircraft that approached the @entity52 north of @entity53 and could not be identified by other means			2
" these planes were later identified as the @entity6 military planes			2
the spokesman stressed that they did n't enter @entity42 airspace , nor has any @entity6 military plane ever done so			1
" the @entity6 military aircraft remained in international airspace at all times , as they are perfectly entitled to do , " the spokesman said			2
in a separate and " standard " event , @entity42 's @entity66 met up with the @entity6 ship vice admiral @entity70 as it was " transiting past the @entity42 , " according to the military spokesman			2
the @entity42 naval destroyer is now " keeping an eye on its transit south , " he added			0
there was no immediate mention of this story on the @entity80 - language versions of at least two @entity6 state - run media outlets , @entity82 and @entity83			0
while @entity42 defense secretary @entity84 said his military is always on alert " to intercept any @entity88 forces , " he did not portray these specific incidents as alarming			0
" recent events have increased awareness of @entity6 military activity , " @entity84 said			0
" but we have always routinely intercepted , identified and escorted @entity6 air and naval assets that transit international airspace and waters within the @entity42 's ' area of interest			2
' " both the @entity2 and the @entity42 are part of @entity11 , which has been increasingly at odds with @entity6 over its activity in and around @entity103			1
the tensions ratcheted up late last year , when demonstrators pushed out @entity103 's president in part due to their anger about his moving away from an alliance with @entity110 and moving closer to @entity6			0
a pro-western government took over in @entity112			0
soon after , the @entity114 peninsula seceded from @entity103 and became part of @entity6			0
since then , @entity6 has deployed what @entity11 estimates to be 40,000 troops near its border with @entity103 , which has made other countries in the area nervous			0
in an interview wednesday with @entity82 , @entity6 foreign minister @entity121 said that @entity6 would " certainly respond " if its interests were attacked in @entity103			0
" @entity6 citizens being attacked is an attack against the @entity6 , " @entity121 said			0

@entity42 military jets later become *involved* ; action is called " not unusual "
but it comes amid heightened tensions between @entity6 and @entity11
