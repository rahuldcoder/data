@entity0 -- in case you did n't notice , @entity2 is on fire			1
rioters are setting blazes , hurling stones , beating up famous statues and some of them kicked prince @entity12 ' car			1
which is a little like beating up a statue , but still ... students have come unhinged over a plan to triple university fees			1
the government says it had to approve the increase to fight soaring budget problems			1
@entity21 are , of course , quite different from the @entity23 in many ways			1
but our young people certainly have this in common : here , as there , tuition rates have steadily risen , job opportunities for graduates have grown more scarce , and the prospects of maintaining the " good life " so many younger folks enjoy now have dimmed			1
and history has shown time and again , that when young people get upset they have a nasty tendency to take it to the streets			1
which has me wondering if maybe we 're setting the stage for similar unrest here on the @entity21 side of the pond			1
we have a deficit problem			1
we 're talking about hefty cuts of services and / or tax increases			1
and we always seem to have reasonable numbers of disaffected youth , no matter how many @entity55 we buy for them			2
now , i would never want to encourage wild civil disobedience			2
to the contrary , i was one of the first reporters on the streets for @entity61 during the 1992 @entity63 riots			1
i spent 50 straight hours in the fray amid smashing bottles , rampant looting , occasional gunshots and more major building fires than i could count			2
" you need to get out of here , right now ! " a shop owner shouted at me shortly after the mob sacked his place			2
" you 're going to get killed			2
" more than 50 people were killed			2
hundreds of others were hurt			2
it was fascinating , especially the guy i saw carrying a looted refrigerator from @entity78 entirely on his own , but it was also dangerous , destructive , and in the end , pointless			2
note to potential rampagers : wrecking your own neighborhood does little to improve the conditions that made you mad in the first place			2
that said , however , circumstances now appear favorable for some sort of similar outbreak of mob violence , given the right catalyst			1
first , unemployment is high			2
when people lose their paychecks , they get irritable			2
combine the frustration of these folks with a job market that stubbornly refuses to give them any hope and you can see how fear of long - term joblessness can turn into anger -- at big business , at the government , at society in general			1
the @entity21 @entity109 shows @entity110 had almost 11 % unemployment in 1992			1
it has n't been that high since			2
um , except for now			0
last year it smashed that ceiling and is now well over 12 %			0
second , political and cultural divisions are deep and deepening			0
i have a caveat to add here			0
my travels and a variety of polls have suggested that regular voters are substantially more interested in cooperation , compromise and moderation than the hard core partisans who dominate @entity0 politics			0
but the parties , as the current @entity129 tax cuts fight shows , are still often more compelled by the idea of making their opponents lose than in helping the whole nation win			0
compromise is what keeps fights from happening in most of @entity21			1
in @entity0 it is a dirty word			0
and again , we can look to @entity141 to see parallels			0
they , too , have watched the gulf widen between opposing political parties as the economy has strained each ruling majority to find quick solutions or pay the price at the polls			0
third , the hard times are far from over			0
even as the nation emerges ( we hope ) from the recession , all the warning signs say high unemployment , low housing values , rising taxes and much lower limits on what government can afford may well be the new normal			0
and one more time , the similarities hold true			0
@entity141 has a long slog ahead of it too , with likely many more privations that will profoundly affect the plans and ambitions of the young			0
none of this means that rioting is inevitable			1
as i mentioned above , there would have to be a catalyst , some event or decision that spurred all that potential angry energy into action			0
figuring out what the catalyst might be requires less scientist than psychic			1
but remember the health care town hall meetings ? no one initially expected them to be as explosive as they were , and yet several bordered on getting out of control			0
there is also this : every society has some folks in it who are really just aching for a good riot			1
one of the best reads about riots is @entity192 's book , " among the thugs			1
" @entity192 spent time with @entity195 soccer hooligans trying to understand what drove them to tear cities apart when their teams lost , or won , or tied , or just showed up at the stadium			0
part of what he found is that soccer had little to do with it			0
the hooligans used their rioting as a steam valve , a way to crash against the barriers of social limits , express their fury over their lot in life and generally spice up otherwise boring weekends			1
ultimately , they fought because they liked fighting			0
what might keep us from having riots ? well , there is inertia			0
getting people motivated enough to storm the @entity222 is not as easy as it looks , and despite our troubles we are still a wealthy society			0
when you have enough entertainment and life is not completely unbearable , it 's hard to persuade the crowd to gather pitchforks			1
but the question " why do riots start ? " remains largely an enigma , despite many efforts to produce an answer			0
we may be able to trace any given riot back to its roots , but that information does n't seem to help us much in preventing the next one			1
i do n't know if we are headed for riots now			0
i hope not , because i have seen how terrible they can be			0
but my experience tells me that the conditions , like dry woods in a season of lightning , are favorable for a fire			0
and once it starts , putting it out can prove costly and difficult			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253 .			1

@entity253 wonders if @entity21 might have unrest similar to @entity256 's
he saw rioting first - hand while working in @entity63 in 1992
@entity253 says figuring out what would trigger a riot is *extremely* difficult
