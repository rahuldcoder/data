-- hunger strikes marked the start of the @entity4 school year as students , parents , and teachers protested against what they perceive as @entity10 - led interference in the public school curriculum			1
thousands of protesters dressed in black gathered outside the government headquarters monday ahead of a 5:00 p.m. deadline for the government to drop the " @entity17 " subject or face further protests			1
@entity19 have decried the subject as an attempt to " brainwash " impressionable young minds with pro-mainland - @entity24 propaganda			1
amid no response from the government , the @entity25 against @entity17 -- a coalition of concern groups -- declared that plans were underway to organize city - wide student strikes and teacher boycotts of the subject			1
organizers also called for demonstrators to return to the headquarters every evening in a kind of " occupy " movement , adapted from the global protest against socioeconomic injustice			2
in a tactic uncommon in @entity4 protests , by monday evening , 13 protesters had joined a hunger strike outside the government headquarters , initiated by three teenagers thursday who have since dropped out due to health concerns			1
camped in tents , the mix of students , teachers , and scholars have vowed to remain there until the government withdraws the subject			1
a parent participating in the hunger strike , @entity58 , told @entity0 : " i want to safeguard for my child the environment in @entity4 in the future , so my son can learn and think independently			2
" from @entity65 , @entity64 activist @entity63 posted on his @entity67 microblogging account that he would engage in a 24 - hour hunger strike to " support @entity4 's opposition movement against educational brainwashing			2
" while the city 's embattled leader , chief executive @entity73 , stayed clear of monday 's protest , the territory 's chief secretary @entity71 addressed the crowd , urging broad discussion via the government consultation committee			1
" there is no topic that the committee can not discuss with committee members and other parties , " @entity79 said			0
" after discussions , according to the findings , we can bring independent and pertinent opinions to the government			2
" @entity25 members have previously declined the government 's invitation to join the committee			2
@entity73 has said that there is a lot of room for compromise between keeping the subject and throwing it out			1
" it 's very hard for the government to take any concrete action , " said @entity79 , an assistant professor specializing in civil society and social movements at the @entity100			2
" the @entity4 government is trapped between the @entity10 government and the @entity4 community , " she explained			2
" i think most likely the government will not take any concrete action except reiterating that the officials are ready to talk to the protesters ; please join our committee and continue discussions			1
" the national education issue has been roiling the city for several months , most notably with a mass street protest on july 29 attended by 90,000 people ( police cited 32,000 ) , sparked by the dissemination of a set of government guidelines for teaching the subject			1
another mass protest took place outside government headquarters on saturday , where organizers reported 40,000 participants while the police estimated a turnout of 8,100			1
while the detailed content of the subject has not been determined , guidelines in a booklet called " the @entity134 " distributed to schools by the government 's @entity136 in july were widely interpreted as a basis for how the subject would be taught			1
the contents of the booklet inflamed longstanding fears of @entity10 's encroachment into @entity4 's affairs and freedoms by stating that @entity24 's ruling party is " progressive , selfless and united , " and ignoring major events such as the 1989 @entity151 massacre			1
the centre has denied accusations that the subject promotes " brainwashing			0
" " @entity4 's future and @entity24 's future are inseparable , " said centre director @entity156			1
" we will never be independent so we should learn to think the same way as @entity24			1
teachers should lead our children to think about @entity4 's future			0
" " in the background , there 's a huge mistrust between the central government and the @entity4 population in general , " said @entity79			0
" the demonstrations and the concerns about the national education reflect the continuing anxiety of the @entity4 people toward the mainland 's politics and growing influence on @entity4 affairs , " echoed @entity169 , an associate professor at the @entity100 's @entity170 , who spoke to @entity0 after the july 29 protest			0
the uproar over the national education subject is reflective of anxieties being aggravated by the new government under @entity73 , which @entity169 said " lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many people			1
" " @entity73 without a doubt reflects a much more @entity192 background			0
if the curriculum was introduced by a more neutral administration , the issue may play out differently , " he said			0
the subject is due to be introduced this academic year in primary schools and next year in secondary schools			0
each has a three - year period in which to roll out the subject in their classrooms			0
in @entity4 , primary and secondary schooling comprises twelve years of government - funded education			2
a survey of more than 600 schools conducted by an alliance member , @entity206 , found that only six planned to implement the program in the first year			0
of the others , 155 said they would introduce it but not in the first year , 118 said they would n't introduce it at all and 198 said they had n't yet decided what to do			0
another 181 declined to respond			0
" it 's the duty of every teacher , practically of every citizen to teach national education , " said @entity216 , the principal of the @entity217 , a primary school teaching the subject this school year			1
" you should teach your children that they are @entity24 , you should teach your children how @entity24 has developed , its history and culture			2
while you are doing this , you can criticize and speak of the good parts and the bad parts			0
" @entity79 said it remains to be seen how the protests will escalate and that government action " will depend on the bargaining power of the opposition			0
" " the question in how much social support ( the protesters ) can draw in , " @entity79 said , in regard to whether student strikes can be feasibly carried out			1
" if the government does n't think these secondary students can constitute a political force opposing the government , including the policy itself , then can the students draw sufficient support from the community ? so it really depends on the consolidation of the alliance			0
" " it seems that among the secondary school students , the extent of mobilization is not limited , but not extensive enough to call for a @entity4 - wide school strike , " she added			0
" so i think the government has also done such calculations			0
" @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to the report .			0
