@entity0 -- must art always serve politics ? to audiences overseas , contemporary art in @entity5 is typified by @entity7 , the most trenchant critic of @entity5 's artistic and political restrictions			1
but not all @entity5 artists subscribe to @entity7 's approach			1
@entity11 ( no relation ) , once a popular singer - songwriter , is back in @entity0 from a long hiatus , this time representing one school of @entity5 's contemporary art scene			1
her style is mostly uplifting and features politics as an afterthought , if at all			2
small wonder , perhaps , that she is the first @entity5 contemporary artist to hold an exhibition in the iconic @entity23 of @entity5 , next to @entity24 , which is better known for revolutionary history exhibits than modern art. @entity11 's solo show opened just a few days after the @entity28 concluded its leadership transition in the @entity30 , across the sprawling square			1
" we chose @entity11 based on our understanding of her artwork and of public expectation , " said @entity32 , the deputy director of the @entity23			1
" we believe @entity11 's art pieces will connect @entity5 's 5,000 years history with modern art. " @entity5 art - lovers know @entity11 best as a pop singer and song - writer			1
the 43 - year - old @entity7 has cut five albums since 1992 , becoming a widely popular folk and pop singer in the 1990s			1
she moved to @entity46 in 1997 and spent nearly a decade there honing her skills as an installation artist			0
her work has been featured in several @entity46 art galleries , including the @entity52 , which exhibited her piece " sounds of @entity46 "			0
@entity55 , a @entity46 - based art critic who has been visiting @entity5 since 2000 , likes the universality of " my @entity57 and my hometown , " a tapestry of woolen patches knitted by @entity7 's mother and bedecked with the @entity63 word " love "			1
" it expands outwardly , first for the family , community , nation and then the world			0
with one piece like this , she is able to touch both poles , " @entity55 said			0
@entity7 does not shy away from love 's racier themes			2
one section shows square panels printed with " i love sex , " and " love me , suck me			0
" she looks at the darker side too			0
" @entity83 , " an installation art , depicts a lonely raven perched on a leafless oak tree made of disposable chopsticks			0
her @entity86 - inspired pop - art reproduces @entity88 's picture of " @entity89 , " which shows a woman holding a flower in front of gun - toting soldiers during an anti-war march in the @entity96 during the 1960s			2
" we hope to present the public with multiple styles of modern art to show that not all art is the same , " @entity32 of the @entity23 said			2
" @entity11 may not be the most popular contemporary @entity5 artist , but she is one of the most special			1
" @entity11 's works are typically wholesome and uplifting , unlike many @entity5 contemporary art works now popular overseas			1
the paintings of @entity108 , for example , are typically bold and edgy , sometimes dark -- and selling for millions of dollars in galleries and art auctions			2
( an art collector has called @entity108 " the @entity112 of the 21st century			0
" ) @entity113 is now known for her bold surrealism , using naked body casts of herself or building a walk - in human " womb " strewn with disfigured bodies			0
she recently had her work featured at @entity120 in @entity46			0
also popular overseas are the irreverent creations of @entity7 , some of which are blunt commentaries of what he sees are the dark side of life in @entity5			1
" we do n't want extremist and esoteric pieces , " @entity32 said			0
@entity11 's message of love , he says , is what the @entity5 public wants			1
her theme of love may seem " corny , " art critic @entity55 agreed , but " it 's not something that she is just falling into thoughtlessly			2
it 's a very considered conviction that this is after all the best response to the difficulties of life			0
