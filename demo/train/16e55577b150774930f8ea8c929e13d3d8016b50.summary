-- in the beginning , one might have considered it bold -- even inventive -- to oppose every single thing president @entity4 supported			1
but it quickly became tiresome and predictable over the last five years			0
and now , as @entity7 @entity6 weigh a resolution to sue president @entity4 for not quickly enough implementing a law the same @entity6 voted more than 50 times to repeal or stall , all hell has broken loose			1
@entity6 are just being obnoxious now			0
on wednesday , the @entity13 will debate a draft resolution to file a lawsuit against president @entity4 , wasting taxpayer dollars in what is plainly a political stunt			1
their complaint ? that president @entity4 did not implement the employer mandate in @entity21 quickly enough			1
that 's right , that same employer mandate @entity6 have berated @entity4 for , the one in the health care reform law they 've voted 54 ( failed ) times to try to repeal or delay or stall -- the law , incidentally , that 's working -- @entity7 @entity6 are now using taxpayer money to sue president @entity4 for not implementing it quickly enough			1
meanwhile , at least @entity6 are n't going full - political - stunt and impeaching president @entity4 ... yet			1
@entity29 has thrown her constitutional - scholar - like support behind the idea			0
though as attorney general @entity33 said of @entity29 this weekend : " she was n't a particularly good vice presidential candidate			0
she 's an even worse judge of who ought to be impeached and why			0
" @entity6 bash president @entity4 for issuing executive orders			1
but why should facts like the @entity39 or how every president in history has used executive orders , and in most cases more than president @entity4 , stand in the way of a good partisan line of attack , let alone a political stunt ? facts and proportionality certainly have n't been a barrier for republicans so far			1
for instance , also within the last week , conservative talk radio host @entity52 said on @entity55 that the @entity4 @entity7 is a " borderline jew - hating administration			1
" @entity6 had long criticized the president as @entity57			1
for instance , the @entity59 campaign ran a commercial criticizing @entity4 for not visiting @entity62 during the first three - and - a - half years of his presidency , and conservative pundit @entity64 accused president @entity4 of " hating @entity62			2
" but suggesting the @entity7 and by , er , obvious implication president @entity4 , hates @entity67 is a whole new level of accusation			1
it 's also a whole new level of crazy neglect of basic facts			0
president @entity4 has increased security assistance to @entity62 every single year since taking office and @entity4 personally championed providing an additional $ 275 million over its standard foreign military financing aid in order to fund the construction of the so - called " @entity80 " defense system			2
" but facts , schmacts			0
@entity6 smears against @entity4 are even more impervious than the @entity80			1
no logic or reason can pierce their facade of bs			0
witness @entity90 @entity89 sen. @entity89 , who last week called president @entity4 " tone deaf " for not visiting the border during his trip to @entity90			2
@entity90 gov. @entity95 also dinged the president along these lines : " the president needs to come to the border , to see it himself			0
" for his part , president @entity4 said , " i 'm not interested in photo ops , i 'm interested in solving a problem			2
" which sounds almost like @entity4 is quoting @entity89 and @entity95 ... back in 2011			0
then , when pressing @entity105 to pass immigration reform , president @entity4 went to the border and ... republicans criticized him for doing so			2
" what sen. @entity89 is looking for , president @entity4 can not deliver with another speech or photo op , and that 's presidential leadership			2
words matter little when there is no action , " a @entity89 spokesperson said at the time			0
similarly , in 2011 , @entity95 criticized @entity4 's trip to the border , " i was very disheartened when the president came into @entity121 a couple of weeks ago ( and ) had a photo - op. " in case you 're not good at math , that 's @entity6 criticizing president @entity4 for doing something and then -- just three years later -- criticizing him for not doing the same thing			1
try as you might , there 's just no way to rationalize the difference			0
republicans damn president @entity4 he does it and damned if he does n't			2
but if you still believe in facts , here 's something for you : republicans crashed our nation 's economy with their astronomical tax cuts , lax oversight of business and unfunded wars			0
but instead of facing the truth and re-examining how their policies systematically harm our nation , @entity6 just attack and blame president @entity4			1
they simply do n't know what else to do			0
that 's not so say president @entity4 never does anything wrong or does n't sometimes deserve blame			2
of course he does and we should have political checks and balances			0
but while blaming and condemning president @entity4 has been @entity6 ' sole strategy since the moment he was elected , they 've taken that crazy irresponsibility to the next level -- including suing the @entity160 for doing his job and carefully implementing laws , even the ones @entity6 hate			1
that 's what all presidents do			0
meanwhile , @entity105 is supposed to work with the president and pass laws			0
@entity6 are the ones who are n't doing their jobs			0
they 're too busy spending our money on their partisan revenge stunts and inventing new outlandish attacks against @entity4 to distract the @entity176 people from the giant mess the @entity6 has caused -- and not only are they not doing anything to fix it , they have no solutions			1
the more irrational and hypocritical the @entity6 attacks get , the more they 're desperately trying to hide this simple truth .			1

@entity183 : @entity7 @entity6 try to sue president for not implementing a law they fought
@entity183 : @entity6 does not let facts stand in the way of irrational partisan attacks
@entity183 : @entity6 ' sole strategy since @entity4 was elected was to smear him
she says @entity6 not doing its job : too busy spending our money on revenge stunts
