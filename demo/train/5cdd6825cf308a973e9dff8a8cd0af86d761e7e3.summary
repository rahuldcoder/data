-- when @entity3 bid to host its first @entity4 back in 2007 , the document quoted an expected cost of around $ 12 billion			1
however , as the extensive renovation of the city of @entity8 has unfolded in the years since successfully winning the rights to stage the @entity10 , that number has ballooned to around $ 50 billion -- more than four times over budget			1
it will be the most expensive @entity4 yet , surpassing @entity16 's @entity15			0
the @entity3 government says that much of this has been sunk into infrastructure -- upgrading travel links such as airports and train stations , building new roads , houses , hotels and conference centers and providing the other necessary utilities to welcome thousands of visitors			0
according to both president @entity31 and his predecessor , the present prime minister @entity32 , the " sports - related " costs have come to about $ 6.4 billion			0
this has largely come from building 10 competition venues , both down on the @entity36 coast in @entity8 's @entity38 area and up in the mountain cluster in @entity40 -- which not long ago had just one ski lift			1
the @entity10 will launch with the february 7 opening ceremony at the $ 600 million @entity43 , which will not host any sporting events but will close the @entity4 two and a half weeks later			2
the arena will then be used by @entity3 's national football team and will host matches at the 2018 @entity48 with an expanded capacity of 45,000			2
