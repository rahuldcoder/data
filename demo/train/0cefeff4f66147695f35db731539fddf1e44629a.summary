@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 's government made an emotional plea wednesday to hundreds of hunger - striking @entity6 prisoners -- some who have n't eaten in more than a month -- to end their protest			1
justice minister @entity9 made the televised appeal wednesday during a visit to @entity13 prison in the @entity0 capital			1
" i am telling the prisoners and detainees who are on this action : on the eve of this holiday , for the sake of your own body , your own health , the people who love you and whom you love , stop this action , " the minister said			1
the holiday @entity9 is referring to is the @entity29 " @entity28 " or @entity30 , which will be observed in @entity0 starting thursday			0
it 's the celebration that marks the end of @entity33 , the annual @entity29 pilgrimage to the holy city of @entity36			0
the justice minister said at least 680 prisoners are currently on a hunger strike in prisons across the country , but @entity0 's @entity42 , which closely follows the country 's long - simmering @entity6 conflict , said 715 inmates are striking in 48 prisons			1
some of the protesters have been without food for 43 days , and there are fears about their deteriorating condition			1
" their health is in bad condition , " said @entity52 , a member of the @entity42 's @entity53 , in a phone interview with @entity2			0
" some of their symptoms include vertigo , trouble walking , violent headaches , bruising on fingers and eyes , nausea , nose bleeds , trouble swallowing water , blood in stool , " she added			0
@entity52 said the protesters had three main demands : the release of imprisoned @entity6 rebel leader @entity74 , the right to @entity6 language education and the use of @entity6 in @entity0 courts			2
@entity74 is one of the founders of the @entity80 , or @entity80 , which has waged a 30 - year guerrilla war against the @entity0 state			2
though he has been in a @entity0 prison on an island in the @entity86 since his capture in 1999 , @entity80 fighters have continued their war against the @entity0 government			0
throughout the long conflict , which has claimed more than 30,000 lives , the @entity80 has modified its goals from demanding a separate @entity6 state to fighting for the expansion of @entity6 cultural and linguistic rights , as well as the release of @entity74			0
for decades , the @entity0 state discriminated against the @entity98 , @entity0 's largest ethnic minority , which now makes up roughly 20 % of the population			2
the @entity6 language was banned , and @entity98 were long referred to as " mountain @entity0			2
" during @entity0 prime minister @entity104 's 10 years in power , the government has made historic outreaches to the long - oppressed population , an effort that included secret talks with @entity80 leaders in 2005			1
@entity104 's @entity111 , or @entity111 , also made a number of overtures toward the @entity98 , relaxing bans on @entity6 language education , appearing to apologize for past discriminatory policies and launching a state @entity6 - language tv station			1
but @entity80 - related violence has spiked recently , reaching death tolls unseen in more than 13 years , according to a report published by the @entity122 , a non-profit conflict mediation organization			0
the @entity122 argues @entity0 's arrest and detention of more than 7,000 @entity6 activists over the past several years has contributed to the radicalization of some			1
@entity104 " actually did more for the @entity98 than anyone up until now , " said @entity128 , senior @entity0 analyst with the @entity122 , in a @entity2 interview last month			2
" ( but ) when a wave of massive arrests of legitimate @entity6 politicians began , that 's when i think young people especially lost hope and the @entity80 's arguments for the legitimacy of armed struggle became persuasive to them			0
" in his appearance before journalists at @entity142 , @entity9 tried to draw attention to previous reform efforts			0
" there has been progress in @entity0 for a long time on expanding democratic rights , " the justice minister said , adding that the government had made a pledge to try to allow the use of @entity6 language in @entity0 courts			1
@entity9 did not address the demand for @entity74 's release			0
@entity52 of the @entity42 told @entity2 the hunger - striking prisoners were determined to continue their protest , even if it results in illness or worse			1
" this is a perpetual and irrevocable hunger strike , " she said .			0

a @entity0 human rights group says some of the prisoners have n't eaten in 43 days
the justice minister asked the hunger - strikers to stop their action
