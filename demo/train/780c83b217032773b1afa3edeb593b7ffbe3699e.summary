@entity0 , @entity1 -- an amateur paleontologist in @entity1 may have unearthed @entity5 's largest dinosaur mass grave after he dug up the remains of two @entity7			1
the dinosaurs ' bones came to light during house - building in the village of @entity13 , near the @entity15 border			0
" a hobby paleontologist looked at a construction site for a house and happened to discover the bones , " said @entity16 from the @entity13 dinosaur museum			2
the finds show that an area known for @entity7 finds for decades may be much larger than originally thought			1
" it could be that the area extends for 1.5 kilometers ( 0.9 miles ) and in that case , you could certainly say it 's the biggest site in @entity5 , " said @entity24 , a dinosaur paleontologist at the university of @entity27 in @entity15			1
the @entity13 area contained the bones of one animal per 100 square meters , @entity24 said , so the entire area might contain bones of 100 more @entity7			2
the peaceful herbivore -- measuring up to 10 meters from head to tail -- roamed river deltas in large herds some 210 million years ago , according to some scientists , when most of @entity1 was covered with desert and its landscape may have looked much like the estuary of the @entity46 now			1
there are two other large plateosaurus sites in @entity15 , @entity24 said			0
it is not known how big they are because one is covered by the town of @entity53 and the other , near @entity54 , by a forest			0
