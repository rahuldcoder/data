-- @entity2 should only be prosecuted if , after an exhaustive investigation and an honest assessment of @entity5 's " stand your ground " law , special prosecutor @entity1 concludes that there is a strong possibility of proving his guilt at trial for the killing of @entity14			1
no @entity15 should ever be prosecuted for any crime as a consequence of the demands of a crowd , however large or vocal			1
this core principle of justice should stand regardless of the facts of a case or the radioactivity of a defendant			2
the justice system , fragile at best , is imperiled when prosecutorial decisions are tied to politics			2
that said , good prosecutors should vigorously pursue cases when justice demands , even and maybe especially , when there are legal impediments			1
to do less , especially in a homicide case , is to create one of society 's greatest miscarriages : the failure to hold accountable someone who acted culpably to take the life of another			0
the victim 's life must be vindicated			0
unfortunately , some prosecutors find themselves legally paralyzed by complex cases or shrink from pursuing matters that are not air tight			1
unless there are clear legal red lights at the outset , successful prosecution frequently means stretching existing laws to achieve just ends			0
this means arguing at trial , and on appeal , that someone like @entity2 can be brought to justice notwithstanding @entity5 's strong self defense law , or that the law should be construed less favorably to those who resort to deadly force			1
in many self defense cases , the defendant can and does argue that the case should revolve around the uncertain moments of terror faced when he was confronted by an assailant , and that everyone in the court room is after - the - fact quarterbacking			0
the outcome of cases is determined by comparing the defendant 's actions against state law			1
in no part of the country is a person threatened with death or serious physical injury required to suffer the first blow			0
a person can be found to have acted justifiably and reasonably for killing an unarmed person depending on the circumstances			0
opinion : without protests , justice for @entity14 ca n't be served @entity5 authorizes deadly force " if the danger could be avoided only " by using it , but does not require a threatened person to try first to flee			0
in states with more restrictive self defense rules , deadly force is only an option if someone subjected to an attack ca n't escape with complete safety			0
in @entity5 and elsewhere , however , even if someone is an aggressor , he can regain the right to use self defense if he withdraws from the confrontation that he initiated			0
thus , a major challenge for the prosecution team in the @entity14 case may be the version of events that @entity2 offers			1
in his account , the first face - to - face encounter with @entity14 was occasioned when the teenager approached him and said , " you got a problem ? " as @entity2 was walking away			1
it is imperative for the state to emphasize evidence that the defendant is not justified in his killing and discredit or explain all contradictory evidence			0
witness statements will have to be parsed with great care , especially where they appear to support @entity2 's version of events			1
the prosecution should also make sure that the defendant can not introduce into the minds of the jurors something that is so off - putting that it gives rise to doubt about the propriety of the defendant 's intentions and actions			1
even though the state has a lode of evidence , including vitally important 911 tapes that can offer a unique window into the motives of @entity2 on that fateful night , it needs to be mindful of the narrative of fear that will be told by the defense counsel			2
( the @entity5 gated community has seen a number of crimes , @entity2 was acting as a good citizen by being a neighborhood watch member , @entity14 is a powerfully built teenager , etc. ) the defense will no doubt also exploit any lack of thoroughness in the police and forensic investigation as a bungled rush to judgment that can unsettle the minds of jurors who might otherwise be horrified by the shooting			2
to convict @entity2 , a jury would have to find that there is no reasonable view of the evidence that would justify his lethal actions			2
of course , the state 's star witness , @entity14 , is unavailable to them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : prosecutor needs to see if @entity2 can be proven guilty
@entity173 : no @entity15 should ever be prosecuted for a crime because of demands of crowds
he says prosecutors should vigorously pursue cases when justice demands it
@entity173 : major challenge for prosecution would be *disproving* @entity2 's story
