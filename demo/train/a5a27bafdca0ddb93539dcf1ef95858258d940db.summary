on sunday , at almost the same moment that dozens of world leaders linked arms and led millions of people through the streets of @entity8 to commemorate the 17 victims of last week 's terror attacks in @entity11 , explosives carried by two young girls ripped through a mobile phone market in the northeastern @entity14 town of @entity15			2
the blasts , which killed three people besides the bombers and injured 46 more , came just a day after another bomb , strapped to a girl described by witnesses as about 10 years old , exploded in a busy market in the city of @entity24 , killing at least 20 people			0
while coming in widely divergent settings , thousands of miles apart , the attacks in @entity11 and @entity14 were both motivated by an @entity30 extremist ideology that rejects a modern world shaped by political , economic , and social liberalism -- and in the case of @entity34 , whose name can be roughly translated as " ( @entity38 ) education is forbidden , " also abhors scientific progress			1
to achieve this end , no deed is too brutal or tactic too low , as is underscored both by the recent actions of @entity34 and the posthumously posted video by the gunman who killed four hostages in a kosher grocery store near @entity8			1
the difference has been that while there has been an outpouring of solidarity for the @entity11 victims and pledges of international solidarity for @entity11 's stand against violent extremism , nothing similar has been forthcoming for @entity14 's fight against the growing power of @entity34 , at least not since the ephemeral and largely ineffectual global social media phenomenon of the # @entity62 campaign last year			1
this is despite the fact that over the course of recent months , @entity34 has proven itself to be as much of a threat to international peace and security as the so - called @entity69 , which has received so much attention			1
in fact , as @entity73 terrorism analyst @entity72 has pointed out , @entity34 's videos show a troubling convergence between the @entity14 militants and their @entity69 counterparts not only in terms of symbolism and ideology , but also insurgency doctrine			1
@entity34 leader @entity83 , for example , first expressed " support " for the @entity69 caliph , @entity86 , this past summer			1
meanwhile , @entity34 has added the jihadist black banner to its logo and the @entity69 anthem to the musical repertoire on its videos			2
in one recent video , @entity83 even seemed to declare that he is establishing his own " @entity93 " and greeted his " brothers " in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 , as well as " the @entity93 in @entity99 and @entity100			0
" even more worrisome than @entity34 's extremist ideology and gruesome terrorist acts should be the increasing military sophistication demonstrated by the @entity14 militants			1
alas , while it is largely ignored by @entity106 and @entity107 leaders and only sporadically covered by major media outlets , @entity34 has been steadily gaining ground in its war against @entity14			2
as i wrote several months ago , @entity34 has , like @entity69 , clearly moved beyond one - off asymmetric attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in the assimilation of increasingly large chunks of territory , successfully overrunning and now effectively controlling large portions of three states in northeastern @entity14 -- by some estimates , a total area larger than the @entity118 , @entity119 , and @entity120 combined			1
@entity34 's territorial base has been used by the group as a staging ground for what has become a steady campaign of terrorist attacks , like the past weekend 's suicide bombings , which regularly hit more than half a dozen other @entity14 states as well as neighboring countries like @entity133 , many of which are already under significant pressure from militants linked to @entity140 's @entity139 affiliate			1
@entity133 's president @entity141 has even gone so far as to declare to the newsmagazine @entity143 that " the @entity144 is at our door			0
" by some estimates , more than 10,000 people in @entity14 alone have died as a result of @entity34 - related violence in 2014 , while more than 1.5 million others have been displaced			2
just last week , the militants stormed @entity153 on the shores of @entity155 , one of the last towns in the region remaining in government hands , reportedly killing more than 2,000 civilians			0
moreover , the militants are showing increasingly advanced conventional military capabilities , in contrast with the demoralized @entity14 military forces they square off against			2
in early september , for example , the group shot down a @entity14 attack jet that was operating against it and captured the pilot , whom it later apparently beheaded , according to a video obtained by @entity172			0
what makes the threat from @entity34 all the more significant is the political and economic context of @entity14 , @entity177 's most populous country and the largest economy on the continent			1
the @entity181 country is in the midst of a hotly contested general election , including a rematch presidential race between incumbent president @entity185 and former military ruler @entity186 , with votes to be cast just a month from now			2
no doubt @entity34 , which rejects democratic politics along with other " infidel " ideas , will take advantage of the campaign and voting process to step up attacks			1
it is hard to imagine how the threat could not have an impact on the vote			0
in @entity8 on sunday , police and military forces fanned out across the @entity11 capital , meaning there was a reasonable sense of safety for marchers			0
in @entity14 , even if the country deployed every last soldier and policeman , it would barely be able to put one security officer at each of its polling stations			0
and , as if this were not bad enough , declining oil prices have slashed @entity14 government revenues , substantially diminishing the resources available to defeat the extremists in battle and win the subsequent peace with social and economic development of an area whose long - running marginalization helped give rise to the insurgency in the first place			0
it does , of course , go without saying that both the @entity14 political class and its military , with all their attendant pathologies , bear responsibility for the dire situation the country finds itself in			0
but that fact alone should not absolve the international community of its obligation ( and self - interest ) in helping to tackle the growing threat posed by @entity34 -- any more than legitimate concerns about generally lackluster leadership by @entity11 president @entity243 and the @entity11 political elite 's failure to deal squarely with the potential for radicalization among segments of the country 's marginalized @entity250 population prevented world leaders from showing their support for @entity11 in recent days			1
as the @entity255 archbishop of @entity256 , @entity14 , pleaded on the @entity257 recently , " we need that spirit to be spread around ... not just when it happens in @entity107 , but when it happens in @entity14 , in @entity261			0
" in the struggle against @entity30 extremism and for peaceful coexistence and progress , it is time the international community recognized there is no place for a tale of two cities .			0

@entity273 : @entity34 makes significant territorial strides
its attacks show growing military sophistication , he says
