@entity0 , @entity1 -- so , what 's harder , steering a space shuttle or out - machoing @entity5 on the set of " @entity7 " ? @entity8 is commander of the current space shuttle mission to upgrade the @entity10			1
@entity8 laughs when he answers the question			2
" flying a space shuttle is a little more challenging than what we did in the movie , although the flying was a lot of fun , " said @entity8 , who knows more than a little about both			1
the retired @entity21 f - 14 fighter pilot is the commander of the current space shuttle @entity24 mission to repair and upgrade the @entity10			1
he also doubled for the actors , including @entity5 , during the @entity27 shoot of the 1986 hit movie			1
then a young pilot , @entity8 had just gotten back from a 7Â½ - month tour onboard an aircraft carrier when he got the " @entity7 " call from his commanding officer			1
" the skipper of our squadron picked four guys he thought he could trust to have this kind of carte blanche to break the rules a little bit , " @entity8 said			2
that included a scene in which a brazen @entity21 pilot buzzes the base 's control tower			0
that would never happen in real life , @entity8 said			2
the movie features @entity5 as a young naval aviator , @entity50 , selected to attend fighter - pilot training school at the then - @entity52 of @entity53			1
to prepare for the film , @entity5 flew in the backseat of an @entity57 several times , including once with @entity8			1
" the actors were all pretty easy to get along with			0
@entity5 , for example , was very motivated , " recalled @entity8 , who is making his fourth trip into space this week			1
he listened to what we told him and became a pilot himself after that			2
" @entity8 is not one to brag about his flying in " @entity7			1
" the @entity68 space agency , @entity67 , does n't mention his film heroics , either			2
but @entity8 is in one of the movie 's most memorable scenes			2
while flying upside down , inverted , @entity8 gives an obscene gesture to the pilot of an enemy plane			1
" they said go ahead and gesture at the other airplane , " said @entity8 , 49 , with a smile			0
" so when you 're looking at the scene where he 's communicating with the @entity83 , or the bad - guy pilots in the movie , that would be my finger			0
" but the flying scenes with the actors did n't all work out as director @entity90 had hoped			0
" the director had to pay $ 7,600 an hour to rent an airplane , " @entity8 recalled			0
" but after a week of spending that much money on the airplanes , he decided he could n't use the footage			0
the actors all looked a little green , he said			0
" @entity8 and the other pilots earned $ 23 a day for their trouble			0
but his biggest disappointment was not getting to see the film as soon as it was released			0
he and the other pilots were invited to a preview screening , but a commanding officer would not let them go			0
and by the time the movie hit theaters , @entity8 was busy			1
he was overseas , on another seven - month tour of duty .			0
