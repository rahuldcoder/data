at a board meeting tuesday , the safety board said that a 13 - month investigation found the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle " because of fatigue resulting from acute sleep loss , poor sleep quality , and ... the failure of @entity14 management to follow adequate safety practices and to exercise safety oversight of the driver			1
