there 's a new @entity4 application that provides hours of entertainment			0
released last week , @entity6 allows you to type in any phrase you want and the president 's voice will repeat it back to you			2
i played around with the app and could n't help but have some ego - stroking fun : " @entity14 , what an honor to meet you			0
" no matter what you think of @entity6 's performance lately , you ca n't help but enjoy the president 's thoughtful baritone speaking directly to you and saying exactly what you want to hear			2
with so many pundits and politicians weighing in on what @entity6 should be saying about how to get our country back on track , this should be a popular application			2
even though the president ca n't seem to find his fighting words of 2008 , you can visit the @entity33 for a free download that will deliver you back to the days when @entity6 fought for @entity35			2
if i could have the president say anything , i 'd have him say what a growing chorus of commentators have been urging for months now , something like , " our no. 1 priority is jobs , and i have a bold , detailed plan to rebuild our schools and infrastructure , revive manufacturing and spur our nation 's green industrial revolution			0
" let 's hope @entity6 will lay out this big vision for job creation in his @entity53 speech , going further than his small bore approach of late			2
and while i 'm putting words in his mouth , i 'd also have @entity6 say , " it 's time to raise the minimum wage			1
" it may sound surprising , but it 's exactly what our economy needs			0
on the campaign trail , @entity6 called for raising the minimum wage to $ 9.50 by 2011 ; now is the time deliver on that pledge			1
raising the minimum wage would not only help working families , it also would help power the economic recovery			1
as the economy has sputtered , wages have stagnated , and even folks with jobs are having trouble meeting their families ' basic needs			2
accounting for inflation , weekly wages have actually fallen by 1.3 percent in the past eight months , and the @entity80 reported that consumer spending , which makes up 70 percent of the economy , dropped in june for the first time in nearly two years -- both deeply worrying economic indicators			0
raising the minimum wage puts a little more money in pockets of the lowest - paid workers , who have little choice but to spend that additional income immediately , helping restore the consumer spending that businesses need to grow			1
preliminary estimates suggest that restoring the minimum wage to $ 10 per hour by 2014 could generate as many as 160,000 new jobs			1
and not only does raising the wage floor help workers making minimum wage , it also boosts pay scales across the whole lower end of our economy			1
unfortunately , low - wage work is becoming the livelihood of an ever - growing number of workers			0
a new analysis by the @entity108 finds that while the majority of jobs lost during and after the recession were in mid-wage occupations , roughly three - quarters of jobs added since job growth resumed are low - wage			0
and while the bastion of low - paid workers is growing , their wages are declining : workers in lower - wage occupations ( with median wages under $ 13.52 ) have seen a 2.3 percent decline in real wages since the recession began			0
while wages and salaries are now the lowest share of gdp since 1955 , corporate profits are the largest share of gdp since 1950			1
according to research by @entity133 at @entity134 , wages and salaries accounted for just 1 percent of economic growth in the first 18 months after the recession ended , while corporate profits accounted for an unprecedented 88 percent of economic growth			1
put quite simply , working people have been getting the shaft			0
not only would a new push to raise the minimum wage help @entity144 's economy and working families -- it would help @entity6 regain populist momentum			1
raising the minimum wage is particularly popular with the public , consistently winning support from more than two - thirds of the public			1
opponents are likely to be put on the defensive , struggling to explain why they oppose a modest raise for @entity35 as @entity155 enjoys record profits			0
they will also resurrect the tired old canard that raising the minimum wage leads to job loss , but that theory was first shot to pieces in the 1990s by @entity163 , @entity6 's nominee to head the @entity164 , when he and economist @entity165 published a groundbreaking study finding that raising the minimum wage boosts incomes of low - paid workers without reducing employment			1
nearly two decades of rigorous academic research has confirmed these findings			0
with so many @entity144 struggling , we need the president to raise his voice and find some fighting words			0
it 's time for president @entity6 to say -- once again -- that now is the time to raise the minimum wage			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0

@entity181 : a new phone app allows you to get @entity6 to say anything in his rich baritone
