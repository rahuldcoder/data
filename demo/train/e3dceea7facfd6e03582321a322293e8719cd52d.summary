soon - to - be senate majority leader @entity0 says he plans to endorse his @entity2 colleague , @entity1 , in his widely expected bid for the 2016 @entity5 presidential nomination			1
" i 'm almost certainly going to be doing that at some point , " @entity6 said monday in an interview with @entity9 's @entity8			2
his comments -- a month after telling the @entity13 that he 'd back @entity1 in " whatever he decides to do " in 2016 -- could enhance @entity1 's credibility with the @entity5 donor class			1
they also underscore how quickly @entity1 has been embraced by institutional figures to whom his father , @entity21 rep. @entity20 , was always an outsider			2
do n't expect to see @entity6 on the campaign trail , though			2
" i 'm going to be helpful to him in any way i can be , but i 'm not going to be tromping around in @entity26 and @entity27 , i can tell you that , " he said			0
in backing @entity1 , @entity6 will be choosing a favorite out of a @entity32 @entity5 caucus that includes several other potential candidates for president -- including @entity35 of @entity21 and @entity36 of @entity37			1
just four years ago , the two @entity2 @entity5 were squaring off against each other in a @entity32 primary -- with @entity1 defeating @entity6 's choice for the seat , @entity2 secretary of state @entity42			1
but they 've grown closer since then , as @entity1 helped @entity6 fend off a conservative primary challenge and win a hard - fought 2014 re-election campaign against @entity46 challenger @entity45			1
" we started off on opposite paths , but we 've become great allies			0
i 'm a big fan of his			1
i think he 's a very , very smart , capable guy , " @entity6 said			0
" we 've become real allies			0
i really admire him a lot , and we 've worked together on a lot of things			0
and i 'm going to try to be helpful to him			0

@entity0 says he **'ll** " almost certainly " back @entity1 for president in 2016
the *incoming* @entity32 majority leader said he **'ll** " be helpful to *[* @entity1 *]* in any way i can be "
@entity6 called himself a " big fan " of @entity1 , his fellow @entity2 @entity5 senator
