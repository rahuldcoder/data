@entity8 died january 2 and was buried after a private funeral saturday , according to retired @entity11 col. @entity10 , a close friend and co-author of @entity8 ' memoirs			1
@entity8 began his career in the @entity11 shortly before the @entity15 attacked @entity16 in 1941 , and he volunteered to become a paratrooper , according to his wartime memoirs " @entity19			1

after months of training in the new tactic of soldiers dropping by parachute behind enemy lines , @entity8 and the men of @entity20 parachuted into @entity30 hours before the first troops hit @entity33 and @entity34 beaches on @entity35 , june 6 , 1944			1
when he landed he discovered he 'd lost his " leg bag , " the satchel carrying all his weapons , when he jumped out of the plane			0
he was behind enemy lines on the most decisive day of @entity3 with nothing but a knife			1
" i later discovered that in our small contingent from @entity20 , we all lost our leg bags and ended up using whatever weapons he could scrounge , " @entity8 wrote in his memoirs			1
" this was a hell of a way to begin a war			0
" still , within hours he organized a small group of troopers to attack a @entity55 artillery position			0
they took out nearly two dozen @entity58 soldiers and four large cannons which had been firing on @entity61 troops landing on the beaches			0
his actions that day earned @entity8 the @entity64 , the second highest medal for valor in the @entity61 military			2

in december of the year , @entity20 and the rest of the 101st were ordered to hold back a @entity55 offensive around the town of @entity91 in @entity92			2
surrounded by @entity58 troops and tanks and facing bitter cold with no winter clothing and limited food rations , @entity8 and the rest of the 101st held back the @entity55 and , along with other allied units , eventually repelled the enemy offensive			2
after leading his men in battle all the way into @entity55 , @entity20 eventually was assigned to occupy the " @entity104 " -- @entity106 's mountaintop retreat near the @entity108 / @entity55 border			2
a short time later , @entity8 left the @entity11 with the rank of major and never saw combat again			2

@entity10 , who considered @entity8 his best friend , said he " epitomized the citizen soldier " who won @entity3 gen. @entity117 , who has commanded the @entity23 during his career , said in a statement on monday that " @entity2 embodied the very best of what a leader and soldier should be			1

" @entity129 said @entity8 " would not have wanted this credit			2
he would have simply asked all of us to never forget how his generation served this nation and the world in @entity3			0
" reaction also came from @entity143 , who co-produced the series , and from the actor who played @entity8 in " @entity7			1
" " when our days run their course and a man like @entity2 leaves us , time and providence remind us that human beings can do giant things , " @entity143 said in a statement			0
" @entity2 volunteered to go to war , leading paratroopers into unknown , yet certain , dangers			0
he led by both command and example ; his wartime philosophy was simple -- ' follow me			0
' " actor @entity161 , who portrayed @entity8 in the series , told @entity1 that @entity8 ' support for him during the production was " generous and unstinting			1
i 'll never forget his rallying cry to me to ' hang tough ! ' " he has died quietly , in private , without fanfare and with the same modesty that he lived his life as one of the true heroes of his generation , " @entity161 added			0
@entity8 did not make any money off his memoirs or the speeches he gave later in his life			0
