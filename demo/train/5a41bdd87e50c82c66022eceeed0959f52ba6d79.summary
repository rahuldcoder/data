@entity0 -- @entity3 officials say terrorists could try to use small aircraft in attacks , but have no specific information that such a plot is in the works , according to a new notice distributed by federal officials			1
" violent extremists with knowledge of general aviation and access to small planes pose a significant potential threat to the @entity18 , " according to an intelligence bulletin issued by the @entity20 and the @entity21			1
but according to the alert , @entity3 officials " do not have current , credible information or intelligence of an imminent attack being planned against aviation " by @entity26 or its affiliates			1
in the alert , which was obtained by @entity1 , officials say as recently as early 2011 , @entity26 was considering options for targeting aviation " possibly believing such operations would have a greater impact than other types of attacks			0
" among the strategies @entity26 members have discussed are using a private aircraft to carry explosives , finding a @entity42 operative who could easily travel to the @entity3 or @entity43 to get flight training or renting private planes for attacks , " believing supervision would be lax due to the large number of private aircraft			1
" the bulletin was issued to state and local law enforcement agencies on friday , a little over a week before the 10th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity55 and @entity0			0
@entity26 operatives killed nearly 3,000 people in those attacks by hijacking four commercial airliners and turning them into missiles , and some of the terrorists had received flight training in the @entity3			2
@entity63 , a spokesman for the @entity20 , said although there is no specific intelligence about a plot , alerts are regularly shared with law enforcement partners on " evolving tactics that could be used by violent extremists to carry out attacks against the @entity3			1
" he noted @entity26 and others have targeted aviation since the 1990s and persist in seeking aviation training			0
@entity63 said the bulletin is intended to " highlight the need for continued awareness and vigilance			0
" @entity3 officials including president @entity80 have expressed concerns about so - called lone - wolf attackers who do not belong to terror organizations and have no co-conspirators , but believe in a radical ideology			2
the intelligence alert says a lone wolf who engaged in an aviation attack would be particularly hard to detect , because " their plans to misuse or steal small aircraft would be difficult to monitor and predict			2
" in the past , some members of @entity93 , including @entity95 sen. @entity94 have expressed concern about possible security vulnerabilities in the general aviation sector			0
the bulletin lists several instances in which small planes had been stolen , including the 2002 case of a 15 - year - old boy in @entity104 who crashed a @entity105 into a @entity106 in @entity107			1
the teen , @entity108 , left behind a note indicating that he supported @entity26 leader @entity110 and that the act was deliberate , " but there are no indications the boy had connections with terrorist organizations , " the bulletin states			0
in addition , a man with an apparent grudge against the @entity119 crashed his own single - engine @entity121 into a building that houses an @entity119 office in @entity125 , @entity126 , in 2010 , killing himself and a worker in the building			0
that incident was not included in the most recent bulletin			0
the alert issued friday lists several suggestions to prevent misuse of small planes such as securing aircraft to prevent misuse , verifying the identities of crew members and passengers , being aware of and reporting anyone who could be masquerading as a pilot , and reporting any planes that have been modified in an unusual or unauthorized way .			1
