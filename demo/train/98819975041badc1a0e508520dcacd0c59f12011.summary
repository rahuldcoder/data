it 's enough to make @entity2 seethe with envy			2
nearly 130,000 pages of declassified @entity6 files on @entity8 investigations and sightings are now available in one place online			1
declassified government records about ufos have long existed on microfilm in the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity15 many of them also live on websites devoted to the topic , sometimes free , sometimes not			2
but @entity8 enthusiast @entity20 says his database , @entity21 , is the first to compile every single declassified document from the @entity25 project -- headquartered at @entity26 in @entity27 from 1947 to 1969 -- in one place for anyone to search or download for free			1
the collection consists of files from @entity21 , @entity31 and @entity32 , the names given to official investigations into unidentified flying objects by the @entity37 military			1
@entity20 's efforts are not motivated by a close encounter or personal experience with unidentified flying objects			2
he says he 's just driven by curiosity			2
" i 'm a history buff			2
i think this stuff should be accessible , " he said			0
" secrets are not bad things ; i think we should know about this and it should be in history books			0
" @entity20 started requesting information related to @entity21 through the @entity52 15 years ago			1
his interest was piqued by the first case he received information on about a 1970 @entity8 incident in @entity56 , after @entity21 ended			1
" it defied explanation , " he said , " and 5,000 foias later my curiosity has n't gone away			0
" the collection contains 10,000 pdfs , each representing a different case			0
the files include the details of some of the most famous @entity8 cases , including the @entity70 incident , the @entity72 sighting and the @entity74 crash			1
still , @entity20 believes the contents are " just the tip of the iceberg			0
" " it 's all a puzzle , " he said			0
" just when you think you 've got all the pieces to make a picture , you realize it 's only a piece of a bigger puzzle			0
" the @entity25 project was discontinued after a joint review concluded that no significant information had come from it , according to declassified documents on the @entity91 website			1
specifically , the review said no @entity8 " reported , investigated and evaluated " ever gave " any indication of threat to our national security			1
" nor did the investigations suggest that the sightings " represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present - day scientific knowledge , " a 1985 @entity26 fact sheet said			1
" since @entity25 was closed , nothing has happened to indicate that the @entity6 ought to resume investigating ufos			0
" @entity20 is not so sure -- especially not after viewing all the documents , which are full of blacked - out material			1
if the @entity37 military ca n't identify some unidentified flying objects , then who can , he wonders ? and what are they ? " the biggest takeaway for me is do n't believe the company line , " he said			0
" i think something big is going on			0
how big , i do n't think anyone will know for quite some time because government continues to make the rules			2
" it 's a hard game to when they make the rules and they 're the referee			0
