he ignores the @entity11 , " the @entity10 @entity9 said			0
" he arrogantly says , ' if @entity12 will not act , then i must			0
' these are not the words of a great leader			0
these are the words that sound more like the exclamations of an autocrat			2
" at the beginning of the year , @entity1 declared 2014 as a " year of action , " vowing to pursue his agenda on his own if @entity12 gets bogged down in partisan gridlock			1
in july , for example , he signed an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity			2
@entity1 's 12 executive actions @entity1 had planned to makes moves on immigration , but earlier this month decided to postpone any executive action until after the midterm elections in november			1

" in the face of war , the president is just as arrogant , " @entity0 said			1
" instead of coming to @entity12 , he illegally acts on his own			0
" the @entity1 administration has cited a 2001 measure passed by @entity12 to fight @entity57 and the 2002 @entity48 war authorization as legislation that grants him power to take action against the militant group			1
more broadly , @entity0 criticized what he described as a lack of " virtue " and " tradition " in the nation 's capital			2
saying @entity70 " is in a full blown crisis -- a spiritual crisis , " @entity0 called for a " revival " of such values			2
@entity0 's speeches rarely weave in his faith , but the senator ticked off a number of talking points friday that play well with social and evangelical audiences , including his stance against abortion and his call to end foreign aid to countries that target @entity84			1
" i think we must do something our world often tells us not to do : seek @entity91 , " he said , arguing the country needs to reclaim its constitutional roots , but not going too deep into specifics			0
" we 've arrived at a day of reckoning , " he said			0
