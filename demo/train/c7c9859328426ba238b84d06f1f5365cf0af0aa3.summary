-- the love - triangles , family feuds and paternity mysteries of @entity5 's telenovelas have commandeered the nation 's airwaves for decades and generated a fortune for @entity9 -- the powerful tv network that produces many of the genre 's most popular shows			1
@entity5 actress @entity14 's portrayal of life with lukemia prompted 23,000 marrow donations after the show was aired			1
but aside from lining the pockets of television executives , evidence is emerging that the telenovelas have had a surprising impact on the fabric of @entity5 society			1
from declining fertility rates and a growing proportion of divorcees , to an increasing awareness of social issues and taboo medical conditions -- it is claimed that the colorful dramas are responsible for a wave of ' social merchandising ' that has helped significantly alter @entity5 values over the years			1
despite a religious culture that condemns modern family planning methods , birth rates in @entity5 have decreased from 6.3 children per woman in 1963 to 2.3 in 2000			1
this drop is of a similar scale to that seen in @entity45 , where the government has played an extensive and controversial role in controlling population numbers			2
although such a change could be attributed to a range of factors , a new study reveals that there is a direct correlation between the availability of the @entity9 signal and low fertility rates across @entity5			1
this is accompanied by a similar pattern of increasing divorce rates , as well as the ( albeit less remarkable ) tendency for parents to name their children after popular characters			1
novelas depict the " small , healthy , urban , middle and upper - class consumerist family , " says @entity67 , one of the study 's authors			2
" they have been a powerful medium through which the small family has been idealized			2
" the changing trends certainly resonate with an analysis of 115 @entity9 novelas aired between 1965 and 1999			0
it showed that 72 percent of the main female characters had no children , and 21 percent had only one child			0
the influence of tv is particularly strong in countries like @entity5			1
@entity83 , a @entity84 sociologist who has studied the relationship between fertility and television in @entity5 explains in a report : " it 's not a literate society , it 's not a place where there are books and newspapers outside the upper 10 percent -- and television fills that space			1
" but as well as fashioning lifestyle choices , the novelas contribute to an increasing awareness and tolerance of difficult social issues			0
@entity102 is the star of one of the most popular novelas in @entity5			1
in it he plays @entity106 , a recently diagnosed schizophrenic fighting not only himself but the stigmas of mental illness			0
" we 're showing a disease that people ignore , " he tells @entity0			0
" and we 're able to expose it to society as a whole			0
" finding opportunities to insert health themes into novelas is described by some in the industry as ' social merchandising ' and its effects are quantifiably real			2
globo executive @entity123 says that one episode , which featured a young girl in tears as her head is shaved in preparation for chemotherapy , prompted 23,000 bone marrow donations in the month after it first aired			0
despite this , @entity131 is quick to assert that @entity9 's priority is always with entertainment and that social issues will never dictate plot			0
however @entity137 , writer of novelas since 1978 , sees the inclusion of health themes and information as a personal responsibility			2
" novelas are used to sell cars and freezers , " he tells @entity0			0
" so why not sell some good information ? "			0

soap *operas* , known as telenovelas , *encourage* smaller families study finds
birth rates in @entity5 have fallen dramatically since the 1970s
divorce and taboo health conditions are also now less stigmatized
