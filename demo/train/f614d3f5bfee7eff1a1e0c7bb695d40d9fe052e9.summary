the first time i walked down the main drag in @entity3 in @entity4 , i could n't believe what i saw ; all the mama bars there and prostitutes openly in the street outside trying to get guys to go in			1
within the first week i 'd already been offered cocaine , though i did n't take it at that stage			1
when i did , it was easy to get			2
i know 100 guys between the ages of 20 and 50 , and i 'd say around 30 of them were regular cocaine users			1
not all were working in banking , but most were , of the ones i knew			2
i know guys in banking in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 and they 've all got the same pressures as @entity4			1
yes , i know some cocaine users in those cities , but the ratio of the people i know to the ratio of people i know who are drug users is minimal -- it 's almost non-existent			1
so it can only really be down to two things -- the availability of it and how many people do it ; the general acceptance of it in @entity4			1
when i read the news of the murders in @entity3 , allegedly by a @entity45 banker , my first reaction was " i hope i do n't know him , please do n't be someone i know , " because it easily could have been			1
i knew some guys who were seriously screwed up and now i realize just how much i had changed in @entity4 , almost inhuman at times			1
getting drugs the guy that i used , you could give him a phone call or a text message from 4 p.m. onwards and within an hour -- i think his record was 10 minutes -- one of his drivers was sitting in a car outside the office			1
you 'd just tell people you were popping down for a cigarette			2
you 'd dive over into his car , he would just drive around the corner , and by the time you got out 30 seconds later , you 've got cocaine and you 've given him the money			1
he had four or five delivery points that were his favorite delivery points and they were all within walking distance of the office			2
and if your guy was busy or not answering , then you knew that someone else had a guy and they could get some off him			0
of the hundred nights that i wanted to get cocaine , i think i can only remember one night when i could n't get any			2
you could walk into almost any bar in @entity3 and stand there and have a drink and you would soon pick up the signs of another cocaine user ; they 're going to the toilet every 20 minutes , their nose is running , they 're talking rubbish , really quickly			1
they would n't say no if they had some on them			0
it felt like some unofficial club where you only knew members first names -- but you all looked out for each other on the drug front			0
a gram would cost between $ 90 to $ 130 ( hk $ 700 and hk $ 1,000 )			0
at the start i was doing it once a month , and after a few years i found myself doing it four times a week			0
i would do one gram for one night out			0
but then quite often i would find myself on a three or four - day bender			0
you could do that because there are a couple of bars in @entity3 that stay open until 9 a.m. and then when one of those kicks you out you can just walk across the road to another bar that 's opening at 9 a.m. -- as long as you can make it across the road without being hit			1
the bars that stayed open until 9 a.m. -- they were n't the mama bars with the girls standing outside , but inside there were always prostitutes asking you to buy a drink for them at an inflated price			2
and then generally it would n't take long for them to ask you if you wanted to go back to a hotel with them			0
you 'd never have to ask them			0
i personally always said no because i was more interested in my beer and coke			0
' no one was really that worried ' if you were n't going on a bender , and you were just out drinking until 3 a.m. , you could go to work and function			0
i was one of them -- i was still functioning			0
but if i had a three - day bender then i had to make up excuses for being off sick , or whatever , or somebody would cover for you			0
generally , no one was really that worried			0
in my office there were three guys who would regularly go awol for three or four days , and of course the wives would worry and would be ringing everybody			0
people would be trying to get hold of them but you kind of knew , " they 're alright , they 're just in a bar somewhere , on cocaine , and they 'll turn up in a few days looking ashamed and promising they wo n't do it again , for a week			2
" if you were out in @entity3 you knew you were n't going to get into trouble with the law			1
you could go into the toilet , into the cubicle , and chop your cocaine up on the ledge behind the toilet			2
you could clearly see that was going on -- the people who were regularly going into the toilet every 20 minutes -- not covering up the noise they were making when they were doing it			0
the women were obviously very , very easily accessible if you wanted it			0
i knew guys whose number one priority was the drinking , i knew guys whose number one priority was the drugs , and i knew guys whose number one priority was the women			2
generally the guys in the last of those groups , you would n't see them around as much because they 'd be off with a woman somewhere			0
@entity4 can break you as a person			1
that scene in @entity3 with these girly bars everywhere , getting cocaine whenever you need it , being able to stay up and drink all night , you end up believing that that 's the norm			1
when you go to other cities , it 's like " why have n't they got somewhere that stays open all night			2
it 's a pain in the arse to try to get cocaine from somebody			1
" i would n't have got out of it in @entity4			1
i would have been destroyed			0
leaving @entity4 saved my life .			1
