-- president @entity2 's announcement that the @entity3 will move toward restoring diplomatic ties with @entity5 is great news for those of us who looked at the 50 - year - old embargo as an ineffective foreign policy relic			1
not only will moves such as expanding commercial sales and exporting goods and services to the island of 13 million people create goodwill with a country just 90 miles away , it will create more @entity3 jobs and allow @entity22 cigar aficionados to come out of the closet			1
it is also an important countermove to the advances made by @entity28 president and geo - political agitator @entity29			0
in addition to his annexation of @entity32 and invading the @entity33 earlier this year , @entity29 has quietly been re-establishing @entity28 's ties with @entity5			1
ties that were severed because the @entity36 was no longer able to be @entity5 's @entity37 following its collapse in 1991			1
sitting back and holding on to a failed foreign policy strategy while @entity29 got reacquainted with our neighbor off the coast would not be a smart move -- even if @entity28 's economy is in shambles			0
in short , there are a lot of practical reasons why this historic announcement makes sense			0
and while there will certainly be critics pointing out what the deal with @entity5 does not contain -- such as removal of the @entity58 regime -- it is important not to limit discussion about our relationship with @entity5 to one family 's ascendance to power			1
after all , @entity58 did not just appear in a vacuum			2
or rather we foolishly nurtured the environment in which someone like him could rise to power			0
that 's because before @entity58 there was @entity72 -- and he , unfortunately , was our guy			1
@entity72 authorized the killing of 20,000 of his own people to stay in power , according to a speech by @entity77 ( soon to be president ) @entity79 in 1960			2
he was a man , who , when on the cusp of losing an election , led a military coup and abolished democracy to keep power			0
a man who stole hundreds of millions from his own people , denied dark - skinned @entity5 an education , forced them to work as indentured servants on white - owned sugar plantations and used the weapons we supplied him to quash any movement that would challenge his corrupt government			2
so before sen. @entity93 and others talk about @entity58 , we should talk about how the @entity3 called @entity72 an ally and friend much in the way we called @entity99 's corrupt president , @entity98 , an ally and friend			1
the way we supported @entity103 's now - disgraced prime minister , @entity102			2
the way we propped up oppressive dictatorships such as @entity106 in @entity107 and the @entity109 's @entity108			0
in @entity72 , the @entity3 shamelessly backed someone who viciously oppressed his citizens because he protected our interests			1
in the 1960 speech , @entity79 noted " at the beginning of 1959 @entity3 companies owned about 40 percent of the @entity22 sugar lands -- almost all the cattle ranches -- 90 percent of the mines and mineral concessions -- 80 percent of the utilities -- and practically all the oil industry - and supplied two - thirds of @entity5 's imports			1
" in short , we pillaged the land and then became indignant when @entity58 sided with our enemy , @entity28			2
here we are decades later , @entity5 are once again hurting economically because of our actions ... should we sit back and allow an anti- @entity3 sentiment to encourage @entity5 to side with @entity28 once again ? or do we look at our history and learn from it ? when we talk about the embargo , and the @entity131 and evil dictators , let no @entity3 policymaker whitewash our role			1
when president @entity2 's critics demand we seek some say in @entity5 's future leadership ask them about our history of picking leaders for other nations			1
and when @entity22 exiles talk about the land @entity58 stole be sure to ask them why was life so good for them under @entity72 , a man @entity79 said led " one of the most bloody and repressive dictatorships in the long history of @entity151 repression			1
" as , i said earlier , @entity58 did n't appear in a vacuum			2
none of which is meant to defend the horrific human rights violations committed by his regime in the years following the @entity158			1
i have spent weeks in @entity5 and have heard the stories about @entity72 and @entity160 from those who lived through the bloodshed			1
who whisper about @entity58 's barbaric firing squads for fear that the wrong person may overhear			1
i spoke with people who quietly run restaurants out of their homes , fearing one night government officials will come to seize what they 've worked so hard to build			0
the people i spoke with love their country ... but they love our freedom			0
and clearly this 50 - year - plus embargo has not led to them obtaining this freedom			0
we 've managed to do business with other communist nations without viewing it as a threat to national security			0
we 've managed to do business with other nations accused of gross human rights violations without questioning our own morality			1
and the @entity28 that provided so much angst during the @entity189 is nowhere near the geo - political juggernaut it was when the embargo went into effect in 1960			0
@entity22 neighborhoods are peppered with incomplete construction projects , a byproduct of the lost financial support after the 1991 collapse of the @entity36			0
libraries i visited have dilapidated roofs and are starved for current books			0
tourists from @entity203 and @entity204 are greeted with opened arms			0
and here we are , 90 miles away , trying to pretend everything was ok until @entity58 showed up when we know that was not the case			2
a local in @entity210 told me when @entity72 was in power , the poor with physical disabilities were treated like pariah and sometimes killed when young because they could n't work on the sugar plantations			2
the following week in @entity216 , i noticed a @entity58 quote on a sign that read " @entity219 " which roughly translates to " the greatness of a country is measured by how it treats its disabled			2
" again , i 'm not saying @entity58 is a misunderstood angel			0
i 'm saying our conversation about @entity3 - @entity5 relationship does not begin with him			1
acknowledging the mistakes we 've made that helped to taint our relationship with our neighbor may put us in a bad light			0
but it may also shed light on this foreign policy hamster wheel we 're on , where we characterize a bad person as a good one just because we picked them			0
and not for naught , it may stop @entity29 from placing a thorn closer to our side .			0

@entity243 : @entity3 - @entity5 *rapprochement* is a huge *breakthrough*
he says critics will point to human rights *abuses* under @entity58 's @entity5
he says those *legitimate* points need to be *balanced* with benefit of history
in the 1950s , the @entity3 helped create @entity58 with its support of *despotic* @entity72 regime
