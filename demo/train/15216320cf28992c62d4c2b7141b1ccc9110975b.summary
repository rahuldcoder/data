@entity0 -- the young senator inspired a new generation of voters with his message of change and extended @entity8 's hand to the global community in an effort to promote a different kind of diplomacy			2
one magazine characterized him as having a " quick charm , the patience to listen , a sure social touch , an interest in knowledge and a greed for facts			0
" a biographer recalled that he " had to touch the secret fears and ambivalent longings of the @entity8 heart , divine and speak to the desires of a swiftly changing nation -- his message grounded on his own intuition of some vague and spreading desire for national renewal			0
" those words could have been written about @entity34 's rise to the presidency last year but actually come from coverage about the ascendancy of @entity38 to the @entity39			1
@entity38 's presidency is remembered as " @entity41 , " for the @entity43 show about an idealized @entity45 's court that opened the month after @entity38 won the presidency in november 1960			2
after @entity38 's assassination in 1963 , the @entity41 legacy was handed down to younger brother @entity48 , who served as @entity38 's attorney general and was later elected to the @entity50 from @entity51			1
@entity52 assumed the mantle after @entity48 was assassinated during his run for the presidency in 1968			2
and with the death of the youngest @entity38 brother , the question arises : has @entity34 become the @entity38 family 's heir apparent ? many saw @entity38 's endorsement of @entity34 in the @entity63 primaries last year as his handing the keys to @entity41 to someone outside the family			1
@entity38 's son @entity67 , a @entity63 congressman from @entity68 , has kept a relatively low profile in @entity70 and has faced substance abuse problems that have led to stints in rehab facilities			1
@entity38 's daughter , @entity74 , stepped into the political spotlight recently , only later to drop out of the running for @entity78 's vacant @entity50 seat			1
@entity48 's son @entity79 was derailed after a messy personal life involving a high - profile annulment , and @entity82 , the former lieutenant governor of @entity83 , has largely stayed out of the spotlight			1
others , like @entity86 , have careers in public service outside of government			0
but @entity90 , a former staffer in the @entity92 and @entity93 administrations and an adviser to presidents @entity95 and @entity97 , says that right now , there are no other @entity99 to assume @entity52 's place in @entity8 politics			1
" these families can kind of go into a quiet state and then can flare up again			0
... it does n't look like there is a @entity38 in the immediate future and the nation 's political history , " he said			1
" no one will ever count out the @entity99 , and so there will be others			0
" " we often keep turning to the same names			0
... at the moment , it does not appear that there will be a @entity38 in the @entity70 other than his son , " he added			1
@entity90 , who wrote the book " @entity8 's political dynasties , " says that while there are comparisons to be made , @entity34 is not necessarily the heir apparent			1
" he 's a voice of his own , had his own agenda			0
... he will build his own legacy , " he said of the president			0
sen. @entity38 , deemed the @entity52 , was an early , vocal supporter of @entity34 's primary and general election campaigns , despite having a longtime history with the @entity135			1
in late january 2007 , @entity38 endorsed @entity34 and drew parallels to his brother 's legendary @entity41 and the " new frontier			1
" " i remember another such time , in the 1960s , when i came to the @entity50 at the age of 30			0
we had a new president who inspired the nation , especially the young , to seek a new frontier , " @entity38 said			2
" i know what @entity8 can achieve			0
and with @entity34 , we can do it again			0
" @entity150 , a well - known presidential historian and professor at @entity152 , says it 's not sure that @entity34 would have won the @entity63 nomination without @entity38 's endorsement and that noteworthy part of his speech			1
" at that famous moment when sen. @entity38 endorsed @entity34 , it was handing over the @entity38 legacy to him , " he said			1
the @entity38 dynasty , known for a history of national public service , has spent decades championing the rights of working men and women , with an emphasis on health care , education and community service programs , among other things			1
the family , often considered @entity8 's royals , has faced tragedy and success			0
" the @entity99 have become the charismatic political family of the 20th century , " @entity150 added			2
" i think there are the @entity178 and the @entity179 and the @entity99			0
they are one of the three great political families in @entity8 history			0
" and part of that greatness , observers say , is the family 's dedication to public service and kitchen - table issues that may be at the core of @entity34 's fit in the @entity38 brand			1
in the late 1980s , @entity34 was a community organizer on @entity193 's @entity192 , advocating programs designed to help the poor and uninsured			1
that emphasis on community service , analysts say , is the bedrock of the @entity38 legacy			1
" i have no doubt that wherever there is a @entity38 , they will be doing public service and they will be , i think , using their name -- the brand -- to help issues and causes that they care about , " @entity90 said			2
@entity34 took that message to heart as he steered through an endless maze of legislation during his first couple of months in the @entity39			0
in late april , @entity34 signed a measure designed to strengthen national community service efforts by boosting federal funding for thousands of volunteers in fields ranging from clean energy to health care and education			1
the @entity223 , recently renamed to honor the @entity226 senator 's sponsorship , will more than triple the number of positions in the @entity230 program , from 75,000 to 250,000 , by 2017			0
but @entity34 meets the @entity38 standard not only in substance ; he also has its style and public appeal			1
in 1961 , @entity235 named @entity38 man of the year , after a tough election battle with @entity238 candidate @entity93			0
the article read : " the closeness of his victory did not disturb him ; he took over the office with a youth - can - do - anything sort of self - confidence			0
he learned better ; but learn he did			0
and in so doing , " the article says , he made 1961 " the most endlessly interesting and exciting presidential year within recent memory			0
" @entity247 , a former special counsel and adviser to president @entity38 , says there 's no question about the similarities between the two			2
" both of them were compassionate and cared about the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid			0
... both @entity38 and @entity34 , by spending time abroad during their youth ... gave both of them a very good perspective of @entity8 ' role in the world			2
... both of them were innovators			0
" and it 's with those characteristics that @entity247 says @entity34 has lined himself up with the ideals of the @entity38 clan and has become a " natural fit			1
" both @entity34 and @entity38 " reached out to young people ; tried to get them involved in politics and government after a period of cynical indifference on the part of young people , " @entity247 said			2
" both @entity38 and @entity34 ... were idealists ... and paid less attention to the old politics and won by paying attention to the new politics			2

sen. @entity52 's son @entity67 has kept low profile in @entity70
community service is the bedrock of @entity38 legacy
president @entity34 similar to @entity99 in political focus , *experts* say
sen. @entity38 was early endorser of @entity34 's presidential bid
