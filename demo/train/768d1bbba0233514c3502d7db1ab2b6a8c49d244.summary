-- international credit rating agency @entity2 announced monday it has once again downgraded @entity6 's sovereign debt rating - just four days after @entity4 leaders agreed on a second bailout for the debt - strapped nation			1
a default on @entity6 debt instruments was near to certain , @entity2 's said in an announcement published to its website monday			1
but @entity15 bailouts to @entity6 will likely help the country to stabilize down the road and prevent a default domino effect in the @entity19 , @entity2 's added			1
" @entity2 has today downgraded @entity6 's local - and foreign - currency bond ratings to @entity24 from @entity25 , " @entity2 's said , calling the probability of a default on @entity6 government bonds " virtually 100 %			1
" the agency based the default assessment on the " announced @entity15 program " and a statement on debt reassignment by the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , which represents financial institutions			1
the @entity32 has indicated that private creditors holding @entity6 debt instruments would likely take losses over 20 % , @entity2 's said			1
under debt reassignment , holders of current bonds would receive new ones in their place			2
the lower market value of the replacement bonds would account for the investor losses			2
the @entity15 bailout to @entity6 protected all countries holding @entity4 's common currency the euro , @entity2 's said , by " containing the severe near - term contagion risk that would likely have followed a disorderly payment default or large haircut on existing @entity6 debt			1
" a " haircut " is slang for repaying bondholders less than they were promised when they bought the bonds			0
@entity4 leaders agreed on thursday to provide a second bailout package for @entity6 and drastically expand rescue funds to prevent financial crisis spreading through the eurozone			2
@entity60 president @entity59 said the rescue deal would be financed by both the @entity15 and the @entity62			0
@entity4 governments and the @entity62 will contribute a total of 109 billion euros ( about $ 157 billion )			0
the private sector 's share will amount to 49.6 billion euros ( about $ 71 billion )			0
but other weaker @entity4 economies such as @entity68 and @entity69 -- seen as too big to bail out -- could falter , tearing apart the eurozone , and hurting other nations exposed to the debt take			0
@entity6 has been forced to impose harsh austerity measures , provoking violent scenes of protest , in an attempt to cut its debts			2
taxes have been raised and public sector jobs cut			0
it is also selling off numerous assets			0
@entity0 's @entity82 and @entity84 's @entity83 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's downgrades @entity6 government bonds from @entity24 to @entity25
the probability of bond default is " virtually 100 % , " the ratings agency says
creditor losses will likely top 20 % , it anticipates
bailouts help protect the @entity19 from contagion and give @entity6 a chance to stabilize
