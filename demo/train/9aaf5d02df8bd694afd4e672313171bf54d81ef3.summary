aboard the @entity1 air craft carrier @entity2 , @entity3 -- the top brass from the @entity7 military alliance roared in aboard five marine helicopters flying in tight formation , evoking memories of @entity13 's famous " @entity12 " scene from the film " @entity15			1
" they landed on the windswept deck of an @entity1 aircraft carrier to inspect an armada of warships			1
twenty - three ships -- including two submarines -- as well as thousands of sailors and airmen from a dozen countries assembled here off the coast of @entity28 to perform a series of joint naval exercises			1
but before ships , helicopters and fighter jets performed their maneuvers , commanders made the case to policy - makers for why @entity39 governments should maintain expensive navies in an era of economic austerity			1
@entity7 's military commander , @entity44 general @entity43 , spoke of cost efficiency when he addressed a hanger full of fellow officers and diplomats from the 28 - nation alliance			1
warships , @entity43 argued , gave @entity7 the ability to practice " engagement without embroilment			1
" the implication was that war weary members of the alliance could use their navies to strike enemies without necessarily placing ground troops in harm 's way			2
@entity7 forces have spent the last decade fighting @entity64 militants in the arid mountains and deserts of @entity67			2
@entity7 's deputy secretary general conceded that these were tough times to maintain costly fleets of warships			1
" what we 're hoping to see as the financial crisis begins to improve is to see members of @entity7 collaborate more in developing military capabilities , to get more bang for the euro , more bang for the buck , " said @entity72			2
@entity72 noted that the total number of ships in national navies -- including the @entity84 -- was shrinking			0
but he argued that retrenchment was due in part to efforts to modernize fleets in the 64 - year - old alliance			2
the key , he and other @entity7 officials said , was to make warships " multi-mission " vessels			2
the hosts of the exercises were keen to promote their aircraft carrier @entity2 as an example of this versatility			0
the carrier first went out to sea in 2009			0
it was designed to be dual purpose , able to function as a weapon of war the could be converted into a floating hospital			0
the @entity2 fulfilled that humanitarian function in january 2010 , when it was dispatched to @entity108 to treat victims of the earthquake that shattered @entity111			0
on a brilliant autumnal day in the @entity3 , however , it was combat capabilities that were on display			0
harrier fighter jets demonstrated their abilities to vertically take off and land on the carrier			0
a team of @entity121 special forces troops rappelled down a rope of off a hovering helicopter onto the deck of a ship simulating the rescue of hijacked merchant vessel			0
the @entity129 frigate @entity130 lobbed shells from the cannon on its bow into the sea hundreds of meters away			0
deterrence ' necessary ' in addition to operations in @entity67 and missions to stop @entity142 piracy in the @entity143 , @entity7 forces led the bombing campaign to overthrow @entity145 in @entity146 in 2011			0
two years later , the alliance clearly does not have the political will to intervene directly in the most urgent crisis threatening the region , the civil war in @entity152			2
" the situation in @entity152 has not generated the same kind of consensus that we saw in @entity146 two years ago in favor of international intervention , " said deputy secretary general @entity72			1
thus far , @entity7 has confined its efforts to deploying @entity162 missile battalions from the @entity163 , @entity164 and the @entity44 to member country @entity129			0
since last january , the battalions have been poised near the @entity152 border with the mission of protecting @entity129 cities from the possible threat of @entity152 ballistic missile attacks			0
but @entity72 and other military commanders insisted that the @entity173 's military deterrent is what ultimately forced the @entity152 government to announce it would give up its stockpile of chemical weapons			1
" deterrence was necessary to force what we hope is a small solution to the problem , " said @entity1 's chief of defense , @entity178			1
more than 30 years after the end of the @entity187 , @entity1 's top defense official argued " today 's challenges call for a new role of military deterrence			1

*23* warships from @entity7 countries conducted an exercise in @entity1 this week
@entity7 's military chief said ships *allowed* it to practice " engagement without embroilment "
the deputy secretary of the 28 - nation alliance *acknowledged* the cost of maintaining fleets
but commanders insisted the military deterrent forced @entity152 to give up its chemical weapons
