-- @entity2 researchers say a new drug could effectively halt the progression of alzheimer 's disease , offering hope to millions			2
the pioneering research -- a joint initiative between the @entity9 in the @entity2 and @entity11 - based @entity10 -- was announced this week at the @entity12 on @entity13 ( @entity14 2008 ) in @entity15			1
the product -- @entity16 -- is the first drug to act on the " tangles " discovered by @entity19 over a century ago			1
tangles are made up of the protein , tau , which forms inside nerve cells in the brain			1
according to @entity9 , the drug works by dissolving these tau fibers to prevent a build up of tangles which destroy nerve cells and neurons critical for memory			1
trials were carried out on 321 people with mild and moderate alzheimer 's disease in the @entity2 and @entity11			2
patients with mild to moderate alzheimer 's disease were given either 30 , 60 or 100mg of the drug or a placebo			0
the 60mg dose produced the most pronounced effect , with those with both mild and moderate @entity19 's experiencing an 81 percent reduction in mental decline after 50 weeks			2
those on rember did not experience a significant decline in their mental function over 19 months , while those on placebo got worse			0
brain imaging data also showed that the drug had its biggest effect in the memory critical parts of the brain where the tangle density is highest			1
in a statement on the university 's web site , professor @entity61 , chairman of @entity10 and @entity63 and @entity64 at the @entity9 's @entity65 , who led the research , said : " this is an unprecedented result in the treatment of alzheimer 's disease			0
" we have demonstrated for the first time that it may possible to arrest the progression of this disease by targeting the tangles which are highly correlated with the disease			0
" professor @entity78 , head of research at the @entity80 , told the @entity81 : " this is a major new development in the fight against dementia			0
" it suggests the drug could be over twice as affective as any treatment that is currently available			0
" if further trials prove successful , the drug could be available by 2012 .			1
