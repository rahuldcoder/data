@entity0 -- former @entity3 chancellor @entity2 once said to me , in the margins of a @entity7 summit : " there must be something weird about @entity10 that you have the press you have			1
also , as i said to the @entity13 into the practices and standards of the @entity10 press set up in the wake of the phone - hacking scandal , one of @entity22 's @entity21 editors once said to me : " the @entity10 papers are the best in the world , and the worst in the world , sometimes in the same edition			1
" that was an astute observation too			0
@entity22 's titles drew most of the fire in the @entity13 , which also heard outrageous examples of how certain sections of the @entity10 newspaper industry treated both the powerful and the weak with contempt , and there are several court cases outstanding as a result of allegations of criminal activity			1
in the wake of the inquiry many commentators -- and newspaper owners -- argued that any regulation that came out of it would have terrible implications for free speech in @entity10			1
despite concern among ordinary readers that much of @entity51 is out of control , the government has yet to introduce formally the independent self - regulation of the newspaper industry recommended by @entity56			1
this week the @entity57 meets to decide on a course of action			0
you 'd have thought on that basis the press , if only for its own tactical reasons , might at least curb its worst excesses while that process reaches its conclusion , if not even learn the lessons of the public revulsion that accompanied what emerged at the inquiry			2
but you 'd be wrong			0
two years ago it was @entity22 's @entity73 that was up to no good			2
now the @entity74 is at the center of a storm as a debate rages following its publication of an article about @entity82 leader @entity81 's father headlined " the man who hated @entity10			1
" the story was accompanied on the website by a picture -- later removed -- of @entity88 's burial plot captioned " grave socialist			0
" the @entity74 is certainly commercially successful , one of the few papers still to be selling in good numbers , and now with the most visited newspaper website in the world			1
but many people in public life -- along with campaigners who protested outside the @entity74 's offices in @entity0 -- now view the @entity99 itself as the worst polluter of standards and debaser of public life , something i have argued for many years			1
one or two people -- though far fewer than those who have supported my attacks on him -- feel i have gone over the top in describing editor - in - chief @entity112 as the biggest poison in @entity10 public life , a bully , a hypocrite and a coward who wo n't even defend his actions in public			1
he is all of those things			0
even in his ludicrous attempts to get lackeys and minions out on tv justifying the attack on @entity81 's dead father , he has claimed the @entity82 leader wants " state control " of the press and " politicians to decide what goes in newspapers			1
" that is the opposite of what @entity81 said to the @entity13			2
other editors are furious at @entity112 's tactical ineptitude , fearing that one possible consequence of the @entity74 's vicious attack on @entity81 may be to bring about tougher regulation of @entity10 's press			1
in fact i think the politicians have sufficient commitment to @entity146 not to allow this vicious row to sidetrack them from seeking to implement the kind of system both press and public can support			0
but what is clear is that it can not have the bellowing voice of @entity112 's papers setting the agenda			2
i last spoke to @entity112 in the last century , when i realised there was no point even trying to have reasonable or rational debate with him			0
as deputy prime minister @entity162 pointed out last week , it is not just @entity82 that @entity112 hates , he hates anyone and anything that does not fit with his narrow , twisted and in my view sociopathic view of the world			2
the forefathers of the @entity74 's owner , @entity169 , supported @entity170 , and congratulated the @entity172 leader on his annexation of @entity174			1
today 's @entity74 says this is irrelevant			2
yet the basis on which they wrote a piece headlined " the man who hated @entity10 " was something @entity81 's dad wrote in his diary when he was 17			1
yet again , one rule for them , another for everyone else			0
like when they complained on wednesday that tv reporters were doorstepping their staff			0
irony does not do this justice			0
on sunday , it was also alleged the paper is owned through off - shore funds based in tax havens			0
so much for backing @entity10 ! when the @entity195 was forced to issue an apology for their gate - crashing of a private memorial event for @entity81 's uncle this week , the editor said it was totally at odds with the values and practices of the paper			1
on the contrary it is totally consistent			0
they have operated like this for years			0
as for @entity112 , his career and his reputation are ending where i always knew basic @entity10 decency would ensure they would -- in the gutter to which he has dragged @entity10 journalism			0
@entity112 and the @entity74 have not replied to @entity1 's request for comment			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			0

this week regulation of @entity10 's newspaper industry is back in the *spotlight*
@entity222 says in wake of hacking scandal , papers should be on good *behavior*
@entity74 's attack on @entity82 leader @entity81 's father *threatens* *freedoms* - @entity222
he says @entity74 itself is worst polluter of standards and debaser in public life
