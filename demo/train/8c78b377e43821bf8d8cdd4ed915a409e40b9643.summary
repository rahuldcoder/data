what really happened to @entity1 ? we know a police officer in @entity4 , @entity5 , fatally shot the 18 - year - old , but police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting			1
the confusion has fueled protests in @entity4 and , strong police response in the streets of the @entity18 suburb			0
here are five key questions about the incident : how did it start ? @entity1 and @entity22 , 22 , were walking in the middle of the street , en route to either @entity1 's grandmother 's house ( according to @entity1 's mother and grandmother ) or to @entity22 's house ( according to @entity22 ) , when a @entity4 police officer confronted them			1
the officer told the young men either " get the f * * * on the sidewalk " or " get the f * * * out of the street , " according to @entity22 's accounts to @entity40 and other news outlets			2
the young men replied that they were " not but a minute away from our destination , and we would shortly be out of the street , " @entity22 told @entity40			0
the officer drove away but stopped and backed up , almost hitting the pair , @entity22 said			0
he said he was n't sure what prompted the officer to return			0
@entity22 told @entity48 the officer said something to the effect of " what 'd you say ? " " we were so close , almost inches away , that when he tried to open his door aggressively , the door ricocheted both off me and @entity60 's body and closed back on the officer , " @entity22 said			2
was there a struggle ? yes			0
everyone agrees on this point , and it 's one of the few aspects of the shooting that police have attempted to detail , though the official explanation has spurred many questions they have yet to answer			1
the preliminary investigation showed that the officer tried to exit his vehicle , but @entity1 pushed him back into the car , " where he physically assaulted the police officer " and struggled over the officer 's weapon , @entity18 police chief @entity74 said			1
a shot was fired inside the police car , @entity74 said			2
after the incident , the officer was taken to an area hospital , where he was treated for a " swollen face , " according to @entity4 police chief @entity89			2
the story does n't jibe with at least three witness accounts			0
@entity22 claims the officer grabbed @entity1 by his neck , and @entity1 tried to pull away , but the officer kept pulling @entity1 toward him , he said			1
the officer drew his weapon , and " he said , ' i 'll shoot you ' or ' i 'm going to shoot ' " and almost instantaneously fired his weapon , hitting @entity1 , @entity22 said			1
witness @entity101 was picking up coworker @entity102 for their jobs when she saw @entity1 and the officer " tussling through the window			1
" @entity107 and @entity102 said @entity1 appeared to be trying to pry himself from the officer 's grasp			1
@entity1 had his hand on the police cruiser , trying to push himself away , @entity107 said			2
was @entity1 armed ? @entity113 , this is undisputed			2
every casing found at the scene came from the officer 's gun , @entity74 said , and witnesses say that after the officer initially fired , the two young men took off running			1
" i saw the officer proceeding after my friend , @entity60 , with his gun drawn , and he fired a second shot , and that struck my friend , @entity60 , " @entity22 said			0
" and at that time , he turned around with his hands up , beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting			2
but at that time , the officer was firing several more shots into my friend , and he hit the ground and died			0
" this matches @entity102 's and @entity107 's story			0
@entity102 told @entity40 that @entity1 got about 20 feet away from the police cruiser before the officer shot him again			1
" the cop gets out of his vehicle shooting , " @entity107 said			0
" ( @entity1 's ) body jerked as if he was hit from behind , and he turned around , and he put his hands up			2
... the cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground , and his face just smacked the concrete			0
" all parties agree @entity1 was shot multiple times			2
@entity107 said it was " more than about five or six " times , while @entity22 said it was more than three			0
@entity1 's mother said she was told he was shot eight times			1
some witnesses said they heard as many as 10 shots			0
@entity74 said only that it " was more than just a couple			0
" what were @entity1 and @entity22 doing before the incident ? on friday , six days after the shooting , @entity4 police revealed that @entity1 was the " primary suspect " in the strong - arm robbery of a convenience store moments before he encountered police and was killed			1
a store surveillance video shows a man pushing a clerk before walking out the front door with a box of @entity169 cigars worth $ 48.99 , according to information released by police			0
the @entity1 family lawyer , @entity172 , said that the person in the video appears to be @entity1			0
read the police reports @entity22 , who was with @entity1 when he was shot , will not face any criminal charges in connection with the store robbery because " we have determined he committed no crime , " @entity89 said			1
@entity89 said that the officer who shot @entity1 was responding to a call about the robbery			1
later in the day , @entity89 revised that comment , saying the officer approached @entity1 not because of the robbery , but because he was " walking down the middle of the street , blocking traffic			1
" has the officer been identified ? yes , but it took police six days			2
police initially promised to release the officer 's name but held off , saying they feared for his safety			1
on friday , police revealed the officer as @entity200 , 28 , who is white and a six - year veteran of the department without any history of disciplinary action			1
@entity200 is on paid administrative leave , @entity74 said , and will have to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty			0
though the officer was promptly released from the hospital , @entity89 said he spoke to him , and he was " very shaken about what happened that day and the aftermath			0
" no further details were immediately available friday			0
@entity1 's family and their attorneys were infuriated at how police released @entity200 's identity and allegations of @entity1 's role in the robbery on the same day			1
" the prolonged release of the officer 's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies , " the family and lawyer said in a statement			1
