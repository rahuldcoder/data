-- it might be @entity2			1
maybe @entity4 will reign again			0
but it is highly likely it wo n't be @entity6 who lift the @entity8 in @entity9 this july , says their former boss @entity10			1
the 67 - year - old , who is now manager of @entity13 , thinks his former charges will run out of puff this summer			2
" it 's really important which physical condition the teams arrive at the @entity8 , " @entity10 told @entity0 's @entity16			1
" @entity6 are always tired because they play too many games			1
" it 's not the first time @entity10 has asserted his belief that @entity6 's international prospects could benefit from a pause in the long @entity27 campaign			1
" it 's like when you 're driving a car : if you stop halfway to put fuel in then you 'll definitely get where you want to go , " the @entity28 said last year			1
@entity10 ' four - year @entity6 reign ended abruptly when he resigned in february 2012			1
his tenure was marked by his poor grasp of @entity37 -- he famously said in 2011 that he only needed a 100 - word vocabulary to talk to his players -- and overseeing a humiliating 4 - 1 defeat against @entity41 at the @entity42 in @entity43			0
@entity10 raged theatrically at his players from the touchline that day , but now reflects more soberly			1
" when you win everything is perfect			0
when you lose , everything is wrong			0
this is the history of football			0
but we did n't play really , really well			0
also the big mistake from the referee , " he says , referring to @entity55 's goal that never was as @entity6 tumbled out of the 2010 tournament			1
the @entity37 media never holds back in its forensic analysis of @entity6 managers and @entity10 also faced criticism for the stifling security of the team 's training camp at @entity66			1
" the camp was perfect , " said the @entity28 in an answer to a question as to whether the criticism surrounding " @entity69 " had been fair			2
however , @entity10 is confident he has made the right choice for @entity13 's base in the town of @entity74 -- close to @entity75 -- for the forthcoming @entity8			1
" i went to @entity2 looking for a camp and we are lucky because we were the second on their list where we stay now , after @entity41			2
" if @entity41 had chosen this place ... but they changed because they built a new camp especially for @entity41			0
" we are really lucky because it 's one of the best camps in terms of location , distance from the airport , everything			0
" now the veteran coach is relishing the task at hand this coming june and further ahead to 2018 when @entity13 will host the @entity8 for the first time			1
" we are back in the @entity8 after 12 years , the experience is really important for the players , " he says			2
" the expectation for the @entity8 in 2018 is really big			0
we need to build 12 new stadiums , infrastructure , everything			0
that will be a really big job			0
" as it was with @entity6 , expectations in @entity13 are high for this year 's tournament , but who are the other teams @entity10 is backing to do well this summer ? " @entity2 is my favorite team because i saw the games they played in the @entity111 , " he says			1
" they improved a lot game after game and they are really strong			0
the quality is not the top like normal @entity2 players , but they are compact and they are really physically strong			2
" after @entity2 i think in terms of quality comes @entity3			1
@entity121 always makes the difference , as we just saw in the game @entity126 v @entity125			0
" @entity10 also believes @entity129 's @entity128 side or a @entity131 team spurred on by strikers @entity133 and @entity134 could pose a threat			2
" after this in @entity137 it 's @entity4 , the @entity8 champions			2
always ! i do n't know why but they always ( finish ) in the first four			0
