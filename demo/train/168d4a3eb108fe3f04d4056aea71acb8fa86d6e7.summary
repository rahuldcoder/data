-- the investigation of monday 's deadly twin bombings in @entity3 will rely to an extraordinary extent on crowdsourced surveillance , provided by @entity8 spectators ' cellphone photos , @entity10 videos , and @entity11 feeds			1
investigators in @entity3 , led by @entity14 special agent in charge @entity15 , want to see any and all imagery taken by anyone and everyone where the blasts occurred monday			2
in an unusual move , the team of local , state and federal authorities investigating the crime openly called for spectators to provide any images or video they might have , all of which could potentially provide leads or evidence in the case			2
" we 'd like to review any type of media , " to include " video [ and ] photographic evidence " of the attack that killed three and injured more than 150 people , @entity43 of the @entity44 said today			1
within minutes of the twin blasts , photos and videos of the bombing flooded @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity10 , @entity51 and other social media			1
all that adds up to a vast , distributed unwieldy trove of potential information for the inquiry			2
the investigation is currently " secur [ ing ] all video " from surveillance cameras at @entity62 , @entity3 police commissioner @entity63 said at a press conference today			1
but investigators want to construct a wider mosaic of imagery , from a greater set of angles and vantage points , than street - mounted cameras can provide			2
@entity63 said authorities plan to " go through every frame of every video we have to determine who was in the area			0
" as is likely to be the case as the tools for capturing imagery grow smaller , cheaper and more mobile , law enforcement officials described the search for spectator photos and videos on a continuum with the accounts of eyewitnesses they seek to interview			1
investigators urged everyone to cooperate with what they said will be an increased law - enforcement presence in and around @entity3			1
" assistance from the public remains critical , " @entity91 said , warning that the inquiry is just beginning to " interview witnesses and process the crime scene " and it could " take some time " before any leads , let alone evidence , develop			0
@entity63 said the @entity62 crime scene , currently narrowed to 12 blocks , is the most complex ever encountered by @entity3 police			1
@entity103 , a former homeland - security adviser to @entity105 gov. @entity104 , praised law enforcement and @entity8 attendees for rapidly clearing an area of thousands of people in order to preserve the crime scene			1
there are limits to the crowdsourcing			0
the data used in the investigation will be crowdsourced			0
the investigation will not be			0
a crowdsourced investigation runs a high risk of becoming a witchhunt , as we saw in the @entity122 shooting spree			0
the @entity8 is one of the most if not the most photographed annual running event in the world			1
this image from yesterday shows professional and amateur photographers lining the course			0
it is unclear whether law enforcement had overhead cameras mounted in helicopters or other aircraft over the @entity8			1
( @entity3 - area cops do n't have spy drones â € ” yet			0
) but the era of readily - accessible commercial imaging tools provides a twist on the exponential growth of surveillance tech used by law enforcement and homeland security			1
the data on your phone can become an adjunct to police during the highest - profile investigations			2
that is n't an unfettered benefit to police			2
the military has found that its explosion of imagery data has stressed its ability to process it , to the point where its futurists are hunting for algorithms that can pre-select images a human analyst sees			0
@entity63 requested that any spectator providing media showing the attacks indicate the time they collected the data so police " do n't need to go through the electronic signature			1
" there 's a lot more data at @entity62 that even a flood of imagery wo n't be able to capture			0
the still - undisclosed composition of the bomb material provides other clues			2
" the site probably was secure in the days leading up " to the marathon , @entity103 says , " but then it becomes more porous as more people and families come through , and then someone is able to get in			0
that 's why eyewitnesses are so important			0

law enforcement reviewing " any kind of media " @entity8 crowd recorded
material is extensive *due* to smaller , cheaper , more available devices like *smartphones*
a *downside* is police *struggling* to work through all the material
