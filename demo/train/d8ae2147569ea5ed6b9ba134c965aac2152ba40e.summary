-- members of a well - known hacking group -- according to a statement and @entity5 messages -- took credit sunday for an online attack targeting @entity9 's embattled transit system			1
@entity10 -- in a news release attributed to the group , and backed up by related @entity5 pages -- said it would take down the website of the @entity15 , known as @entity15 , between noon and 6 p.m. pt sunday			1
this is in response to the system 's decision to cut off cellphone signals at " select " subway stations in response to a planned protest last week			1
" by ( cutting cell service ) , you have not only threatened your citizens ' safety , you have also performed an act of censorship , " a seemingly computer - generated voice -- speaking over dramatic music and images -- said in a video posted online sunday afternoon			1
" by doing this , you have angered @entity10			2
" on sunday afternoon , a link off @entity15 's website to @entity36 apparently had been hacked			1
it showed a page featuring , among other items , the @entity10 logo -- a smirking mask above two crossed swords , all on a black background			2
in addition , @entity5 traffic related to @entity10 boasted that hackers had been able to get into @entity15 's internal network			1
several related items and documents were posted , including one claiming to be " the @entity51 of @entity52			0
" this had e-mails and , in some cases , phone numbers of hundreds of people			0
" we apologize to any citizen that has his information published , but you should go to @entity15 and ask them why your information was n't secure with them , " the posted item said			2
" also do not worry , probably the only information that will be abused from this database is that of @entity15 employees			0
" a call to a @entity15 communication officer was not immediately returned			0
in a statement on its website released earlier in the day , @entity15 acknowledged that it was aware of the threatened online attack -- and was taking steps in response			1
" we 're doing what we can to defend against any attack on the @entity15 website , " the system said			1
" @entity15 's website infrastructure is wholly separate from any computer network involved in the operation of @entity15 service			0
" in recent years , the hacking collective calling itself @entity10 has targeted several organizations to make political statements			1
last week , for instance , @entity10 promised an " operation " targeting @entity91			1
and it took credit for hacking the site of the @entity95 , replacing its content with an anti-government message and the @entity10 logo			0
@entity10 also has boasted about taking down numerous other prominent websites , including those of @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and the @entity104			0
the action in @entity9 is the latest challenge for the transit system , which has faced criticism after several shootings involving its police officers -- the latest coming last month and resulting in the death of 45 - year - old @entity113			0
demonstrators had planned a rally last thursday to bring attention to the issue			0
but @entity15 contended that such a protest during rush hour endangered the safety of commuters and employees			2
in response , the system said in a statement that " it temporarily interrupted service at select @entity15 stations as one of many tactics to ensure the safety of everyone on the platform			2
" the move was made on the same day that @entity135 prime minister @entity134 proposed a crackdown on social media to quell riots			0
the statement from @entity10 also touted a new peaceful demonstration that it said would occur at 5 p.m. monday at the transit system 's @entity142 station			1
" we sincerely hope that this series of actions will serve as a warning to @entity15 and every public organization in the @entity150 to not engage in this sort of dangerous and human rights violating behavior , " the statement said			0
in the video statement linked to @entity10 and posted sunday , a voice urges demonstrators to wear red shirts " in remembrance of those who have been battered by the @entity15 police " and bring a camera to record the events			1
" we will show the world and @entity15 that we will not stand for these types of actions , " the voice said			0
@entity15 issued another alert sunday advising riders about the possible monday protest			1
" as always , @entity15 's primary mission is to ensure your safety and keep trains on - time , " said a statement on the system 's website			2
" @entity15 may need to close some stations temporarily or make other service adjustments on short notice			0
" @entity0 's @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
