@entity0 -- a trio of congressional @entity3 passionately appealed to the @entity4 on thursday to drop charges against three @entity6 accused of assaulting an @entity7 suspected of orchestrating the 2004 killing and mutilation of four @entity11 contractors			1
flanked by about a dozen retired @entity6 at a news conference near the @entity14 , rep. @entity15 , @entity16 ; rep. @entity17 , @entity18 ; and rep. @entity19 , @entity20 , insisted that the @entity11 is sending the wrong message to its troops			1
" these @entity6 were apprehending a terrorist murderer , and they are being accused of roughing him up ? give me a break ! these men should be given medals , not prosecuted			1
these men are heroes , " @entity15 said			1
@entity17 agreed , saying , " these people are laying their lives on the line every day , and they ca n't go into a combat situation with kid gloves on			0
" the congressmen said they plan to present to @entity4 officials petitions signed by thousands of people supporting the @entity6			1
the @entity7 suspect , @entity37 , complained to investigators he was punched during his detention			2
one of the three seals , petty officer 2nd class @entity41 , 24 , accused of assault , stood next to his attorney at the event thursday			2
@entity19 said those who bring harm to @entity11 should not get the same judicial treatment as @entity11 citizens			2
" they get all their constitutional rights			0
well , we 've got heroes around who deserve the constitutional rights of an even better caliber			0
and yes , there are different levels of constitutional rights , " he said			0
in january , a military judge ruled that the trials of the two other seals should be held on a base in @entity7			1
petty officer 2nd class @entity65 , 25 , and petty officer 1st class @entity67 , 28 , are charged with dereliction of duty and impeding an official investigation surrounding the @entity7 's detention last september			2
their trials are set to begin next month			0
the case against the @entity6 has sparked outrage that the sailors are being tried at all for handling a suspect in the contractors ' murders , one of the most notorious incidents in the @entity7 war			1
the killings got widespread news coverage when the burned bodies of two of the contractors were paraded through the streets of @entity89 and hanged from a bridge as their captors cheered			0
" in this case , we 've turned logic upside down on its head , " said @entity15			0
" our government is taking the word of a terrorist and attacking our defenders			0
