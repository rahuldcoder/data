@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 has pledged more than $ 500 million for famine victims in @entity1 as the @entity5 met in emergency session monday to address the aid response in @entity1 , the hardest - hit nation in the region			1
" immediate relief and recovery is the first priority , and it is important to act fast to reduce human suffering , " @entity3 president @entity9 said in a news release			1
also monday , representatives of 191 member countries of the @entity5 's @entity18 met in @entity19 to devise a plan to head off the imminent food crisis , which the @entity5 has said is affecting more than 12 million people			1
two regions in southern @entity1 are suffering famine			1
" world leaders have no excuses for not generously responding , " @entity26 chief executive @entity25 said in a statement			0
" this should not be happening			0
it is a colossal outrage that the warnings went unheeded , that the lessons of previous famines have been ignored			0
yes , we need to save lives today , but we also need to ensure that people have a future			2
above all , we need to build a global food system that allows everyone enough to eat			0
" but such efforts will take time to translate into aid on the ground for the many people in @entity1 whose needs are immediate			1
in @entity0 , across the border from @entity50 , @entity48 workers were registering women and children monday in a rocky square in this dusty town dotted with thorn bushes			1
in a visit monday by @entity2 , no one appeared to be receiving aid , and no one was receiving medical help -- they were just getting registered			1
aid officials said they hoped to get food to areas in need in the coming days			2
they said that some people who had fled across the border into neighboring @entity50 or @entity67 were returning after hearing that distribution was set to begin soon			2
at a second registration point nearby , neat lines of women , their children and grandchildren also waited to get registered			2
mixed with the town 's residents were people who had fled from other parts of the country in search of aid			1
children were drinking water from an oil drum perched atop a donkey			0
@entity2 's journalists reached the town by driving in a convoy protected by armed militia members aligned with the government			0
the militant @entity91 group @entity90 , which has sworn allegiance to @entity93 and is designated a terrorist group by the @entity95 , is less than 50 miles away and could easily move into this area if they wished , according to @entity5 security officials on the scene			1
@entity90 has reversed a pledge to allow foreign aid agencies to operate in famine - struck regions in the nation			1
the group originally banned the aid agencies from areas under its control in 2009 , describing them as @entity108 spies and @entity110 crusaders			2
" we are building up in @entity114 , where we are reaching up to 300,000 people , " @entity111 , executive director of the @entity48 , said about the violence - ravaged capital			2
" but the @entity48 has lost 14 people since 2008 , just trying to get kids food			2
it 's dangerous , and it 's risky , and we are committed to going to where the people need the most			2
" the @entity48 has airlifted supplies to @entity0 , which borders @entity50			1
" one thing that is important is to get the supplementary nutritional foods to these children , because children get very weak quickly on these treks , " @entity111 said			0
the @entity128 said operating in the nation is a challenge			0
" we have teams deployed throughout the country , " said @entity132 , a spokesman for the @entity133			0
" logistically , it is very complex to operate in @entity1			1
" more funds are needed to expand aid , the spokesman said			2
" we are covering most of the most vulnerable people in the areas we reach , but more needs to be done , " he said			0
" if we can get more money , we can do it			0
" he said the @entity128 was continuing to operate throughout @entity1 , as it has for the past 20 years , without encountering problems with @entity90			1
" we are deployed in all provinces , while most of the organizations have just a few spots , " he said			0
the @entity3 announced monday that it is providing more than $ 500 million to assist drought victims and $ 12 million in immediate aid to the hardest - hit areas			1
the drought has led to starvation and the loss of crops and livestock			0
food prices have nearly tripled in some areas since last year , worsening the crisis			0
the funds will go toward battling the worst drought in 60 years in @entity160 nations , including @entity50 , @entity67 and @entity161 , the @entity3 said			1
the pledge comes as international aid groups warned that most @entity1 have no access to food , and failure to reach them puts children most at risk as their parents trek for days in search of help			1
" women have been telling us throughout the area that they 've had to leave children along the road who ca n't make it , who are too weak to make it and have died along the way , " @entity111 said			0
as the crisis escalates , relief agencies are scrambling to find ways to deliver supplements to areas that are hardest - hit			0
about 60 % of the @entity1 population is not getting aid , @entity111 said			1
aid groups are hoping to reach @entity1 in the country before they flee to overcrowded camps in @entity67 and @entity50 for help			1
" when children have to move long distances , their bodies deteriorate very quickly , " @entity111 said			0
" for children under 5 years old , their bodies and brains ca n't grow normally			0
" @entity2 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			0

new : in @entity0 , people are getting registered but the aid had not yet arrived
