in the second part of a long - ranging interview , @entity1 's leader urged @entity4 to capture @entity5 as pawns that might be used to free prisoners aligned with his movement			1
asked what he 'd tell " muslims and the mujahedeen " -- a term used for some @entity13 militants -- to do to " fulfill their duty " toward their allies in custody , @entity19 said , " i advise them to capture @entity5 -- and especially the @entity22 , as much as they can -- to exchange them for our captives			1
" this was one of many comments on a wide array of topics that @entity19 touched on in a question - and - answer session with @entity1 's media arm , audio of which was published on the radical @entity13 website @entity33			1
@entity34 can not independently verify the authenticity of the recording , though the voice appears very similar to previous messages from @entity19			0
in the first part of the interview , which was posted online a week ago , @entity19 insisted that @entity1 is holding strong and , in fact , " expanding " 13 years after the @entity22 launched its " war on terror " following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" the upper hand is for the one who does not withdraw from his land , " he said			0
" who has withdrawn from @entity48 , and who has not ? who has withdrawn from @entity51 and who has not ? " the second part of the interview was apparently published last saturday			0
@entity34 learned about this part of the exchange via the @entity57 , which monitors terror - related websites			0
in it , @entity19 expresses solidarity with the @entity61 in its struggle with @entity64 's military - led government			1
voters elected that @entity13 group 's candidate , @entity66 , as president -- a decision the @entity1 leader said " the @entity5 , led by @entity22 , " did not respect			2
since then , the @entity72 government has banned the @entity61 and detained many of its leaders , including the now - ousted @entity66			0
@entity19 said the @entity13 group has " all the right to use force against the injustice they are facing			2

a combination of ground assaults and airstrikes -- including by suspected @entity22 drones -- april 19 - 21 killed more than 60 suspected @entity1 militants , @entity89 officials have said			1
