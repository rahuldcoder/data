-- home to up to 10 percent of all known species , @entity1 is recognized as one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet			1
the twin threats of climate change and human encroachment on natural environments are , however , threatening the existence of the country 's rich wildlife			1
and there is a great deal to lose			2
in the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) @entity18 's list of megadiverse countries @entity1 ranks 11th			1
the list represents a group of 17 countries that harbor the majority of the @entity25 's species and are therefore considered extremely biodiverse			1
from its coral reefs in the @entity27 to its tropical jungles in @entity29 and the @entity30 and its deserts and prairies in the north , @entity1 boasts an incredibly rich variety of flora and fauna			1
some 574 out of 717 reptile species found in @entity1 -- the most in any country -- can only be encountered within its borders			1
it is home to 502 types of mammals , 290 species of birds , 1,150 varieties of birds and 26,000 classifications of plants			1
@entity50 , a non-profit organization that works to promote conservation and sustainable development in @entity1 , has selected six species which it says symbolize the problems faced by the destruction of nature			1
" these are only some of the species which have some degree of conservation , " says @entity58 , director of conservation at @entity60			1
" however , there is a countless number of species in @entity1 which find themselves in danger of extinction			1
" @entity69 it is the country 's national symbol yet the @entity69 is close to extinction in @entity1			1
one of the largest raptors or birds of prey in the world , the @entity69 's wingspan can reach lengths greater than two metres			1
only the @entity77 and the @entity78 exceed it in size in @entity81			2
with its powerful hooked bill and long and sharp claws it can sometimes capture prey of a size that is surprising for its size , including crane , wild ungulates and domestic livestock , though more often than not it tends to feed off small mammals such as rabbits , hares , ground squirrels and prairie dogs as well as reptiles and small - to - medium sized birds			2
primarily a solitary bird , the @entity69 pairs up to breed , building nests made of dry branches in cliffs and escarpments			1
the female typically lays two eggs which are incubated by both the male and female			2
usually , only one of the hatchlings survives			2
the @entity69 can be found in @entity111 and @entity112 and mainly in the western part of @entity81			1
it was common in @entity1 but in recent years has become a rare sight			1
its demise has been attributed to the destruction of its habitat and the elimination of its natural prey			0
human activity , in the form of hunting , capturing and commercial sale have also contributed to its decline			2
@entity50 has lobbied for legal protection of this bird that forms part of @entity1 's flag and has launched conservation projects in its natural habitat , such as in the @entity132 and the @entity133			1
@entity134 @entity135 , a @entity137 fisherman form @entity138 , claims to be the first person to have a friendly encounter with a gray whale			0
up until then this enormous cetacean -- an adult can reach a length of 16 meters and weigh in at 36 tons - had been known as the devil fish for its aggressive behavior when hunted			0
the main group of gray whales is found in the northeastern @entity149			0
each year a herd of 25,000 whales sets out on what is believed to be the longest migration in the animal kingdom - 12,500 miles - between their feeding grounds in the @entity158 and @entity159 seas off @entity160 and their breeding territory in the warmer waters of the lagoons of @entity138			0
over its lifetime , it is estimated that an @entity149 gray whale will travel the equivalent of a return trip to the moon			0
a smaller herd of about 300 gray whales can be found in the @entity149 between @entity173 and the @entity174 in @entity175			0
excessive hunting in the 19th century pushed the gray whale to the brink of extinction but protection mandated by the @entity180 in 1946 and the declaration by the @entity137 government of @entity183 in 1972 as a @entity134 refuge means that it is one of the few success stories			0
@entity50 and the @entity188 foundation have raised nearly $ 4 million with which they hope to guarantee the protection of 20,000 hectares of the gray whale 's habitat in @entity138 and ensure its survival in the years to come			2
@entity195 it may be top of the food chain but this does n't guarantee the survival of the jaguar in @entity1			1
the largest cat in the @entity202 ( it 's nearest rival is the puma ) , the jaguar can be found anywhere from the @entity207 to as far south as northern @entity208			2
in @entity1 , it can be found mainly in the tropical forests of @entity29 and the @entity30			1
with its tawny yellow coat speckled with black rosette - like spots for camouflage , the jaguar resembles most the leopard of @entity216 , although it has a stockier build which makes it adept at climbing trees , stalking through undergrowth and swimming			0
the jaguar 's list of prey is long : it can hunt anything from white - nosed coati to larger mammals such as deer			1
its unique anatomy -- it has an unusually large head and powerful teeth in comparison to other big cats -- gives it an abnormally powerful bite , meaning that it can take on armoured reptiles such as caiman , crocodiles and tortoises , while it often bites through an animal 's skull to inflict a killer blow to the brain			1
it plays an essential part in maintaining a balanced ecosystem by hunting species which would put local environments out of kilter if they were to become too abundant			2
the jaguar is an important symbol in local @entity137 culture			2
the @entity253 believed it was a messenger between the living and the dead and @entity257 kings often incorporated the jaguar into their name , while an elite group of @entity188 warriors were known as " @entity195 '			0
in @entity1 , the jaguar is a threatened species			1
its decline is mainly due to the destruction of its natural habitat			0
for example , in the @entity264 in northern @entity266 state , @entity60 reports that only 20 percent of the original forest cover remains , the rest having been cleared for cattle - herding			2
tourist development also plays its part ; @entity273 , where cameras placed in the forest have captured images of six individual jaguars and pumas , is close to @entity1 's tourism capital , @entity280			1
@entity60 estimates that if present conditions persist , the jaguar could become extinct in the northeastern part of the @entity30 within 30 to 40 years			0
@entity284 closely related to squirrels , chipmunks and marmots , the @entity137 prairie dog is a burrowing mammal found in northeastern @entity1			1
it earnt its name from its distinctive call -- a mixture of barks and yips -- which is believed to be one of the most sophisticated languages in the animal world			0
the @entity137 prairie dog feeds on the herbs and grasses of the plains of northeastern @entity1 and lives in " towns " -- excavated colonies of up to 50 individuals which are ruled by a single alpha male			1
listed as an endangered species since 1970 , the prairie dog now occupies less than two percent of its former territory and can now only be found in southern @entity308 and northern @entity309 -- an area of less than 500 square miles			1
while vulnerable to hunting from coyotes , bobcats , badgers and hawks , its largest threat is loss of habitat due to agricultural expansion			2
@entity137 farmers have often viewed the prairie dog as a pest and it has often been hunted or poisoned			0
@entity1 fights for the legal protection of " @entity322 " , an area of grassland in @entity325 , @entity309 and @entity308 and it has signed a conservation agreement with private land owners and ejidos ( farming collectives ) to protect 42 , 000 hectares of land			1
@entity331 each year , between december and march , these orange and black - patterned butterflies , the size of an adult human hand , congregate in numbers of up to 250 million in a pine and oyamel tree forest in @entity339 in @entity137			2
they migrate approximately 3,000 miles from the border between northeastern @entity207 and @entity342 and their gathering to breed in @entity1 is considered one of the most extraordinary sights in the natural world			1
during its life cycle , which can be up to 20 weeks , the @entity331 goes through what is known as a complete metamorphosis , comprising four stages			0
from eggs laid by the female , a caterpillar is hatched			0
the caterpillar eats its own egg case and feeds off milkweed while storing energy in the form of fat and nutrients			0
it then spins a silk pad and hangs from a leaf or twig while it molts			0
within its green exoskeleton , hormonal changes occur , converting the caterpillar into a butterfly			0
after two weeks a mature butterfly emerges			0
but in the last 20 years forest cover in its breeding habitat has decreased by an estimated 40 percent			2
illegal logging , an increase in cases of forest fires and high levels of poverty in the region which put pressure on natural resources , have all contributed to a situation in which @entity50 believes the forest may disappear completely within 20 years			0
@entity50 and the non-profit organization @entity386 for the @entity388 's @entity387 have launched projects to promote sustainable development programs that help improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of the " @entity395 " community and reduce the direct pressure on the natural resources			1
they also hope to reforest 30 , 000 hectares of the @entity331 reserve with oyamel trees			0
@entity401 the elusive vaquita ( " little cow " ) or cochito ( " little pig " ) is one of the smallest and most endangered cetaceans in the world			0
the only endemic marine mammal in @entity1 , this porpoise can only be found in a small area in the upper @entity411 and the @entity412			1
the vaquita can grow up to 1.5 meters and closely resembles the harbor porpoise in life span and breeding habits			0
it feeds on small fishes and squids			0
only 50 years ago the vaquita was unkown to science and yet it is now classed as " in critical danger of extinction " by the @entity424			0
the vaquita is difficult to monitor because it often dives when it hears motor boats approaching but generous estimates place its population at 600			0
however , a recent study put the number as low as 150			0
with an estimated 39 to 54 dying every year as a result of by - catches , it seems only a matter of time before the vaquita disappears completely			0
its main threat comes from gillnets -- highly effective fishing nets used to capture the totoaba , an enormous fish with high commercial value -- in which the vaquita gets caught up and drowns			2
in 1983 the @entity137 government established the @entity441 to protect them but it would seem that more stringent fishing laws must be implemented if the vaquita is to survive			0

@entity1 hosts to up to 10 percent of all known species on @entity25
it is home to 502 types of mammals , 290 bird species and 26,000 types of plants
human development and climate change is placing a big strain on its biodiversity
the @entity69 is under threat in spite of being the country 's national symbol
