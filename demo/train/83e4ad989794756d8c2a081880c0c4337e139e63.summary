-- who am i ? how do i identify ? lately , i 've been telling people that i 'm a criminal			1
this shocks most people , since i do n't " look like " one			0
i 'm a fairly clean - cut , light - skinned black woman with fancy degrees from @entity8 and @entity9			0
i 'm a law professor and i once clerked for a @entity11 @entity10 -- not the sort of thing you 'd expect a criminal to do			1
what 'd you get convicted of ? people ask			1
well , then why do you say you 're a criminal ? because i am a criminal , i say , just like you			1
this is where the conversation gets interesting			1
most of my acquaintances do n't think of themselves as criminals			0
no matter what their color , age or gender , most of the people in my neighborhood and in my workplace seem to think criminals exist somewhere else -- in ghettos , mainly			0
they have an unspoken , but deeply rooted identity as " law - abiding citizens			2
" i ask them , " have n't you ever committed a crime ? " oddly , people often seem perplexed by this question			0
what do you mean ? they say			0
i mean , have n't you ever smoked pot , did n't you ever drink underage , do n't you sometimes speed on the freeway , have n't you gotten behind the wheel after having a couple of drinks ? have n't you broken the law ? well , yeah , they say , but i 'm not a criminal			2
oh , really ? what are you , then ? as i see it , you 're just somebody who has n't been caught			1
you 're still a criminal , no better than many of those who 've been branded felons for life			1
perhaps there should be a box on the census form that says " i 'm a criminal			2
" everyone who has ever committed a crime would be required to check it			0
if everyone were forced to acknowledge their own criminality , maybe we , as a nation , would second - guess our apparent zeal for denying full citizenship to those branded felons			0
in this country , we force millions of people -- who are largely black and brown -- into a permanent second - class status , simply because they once committed a crime			2
once labeled a felon , you are ushered into a parallel social universe			2
you can be denied the right to vote , automatically excluded from juries and legally discriminated against in employment , housing , access to education and public benefits -- forms of discrimination that we supposedly left behind			0
this kind of stigma , discrimination and social exclusion may befall you for no reason other than you were once caught with drugs			1
i doubt @entity108 thinks of himself as a criminal , though he should			1
he has admitted to using illegal drugs during his college years -- lots , in fact			0
what if he thought of himself as a criminal ? what if he identified that way ? would it lead him to feel a bit more compassion for those who are branded drug felons for life , unable to find work or housing , and deemed ineligible even for food stamps ? maybe if @entity108 thought of himself as a criminal he would n't have just endorsed spending even more money on prisons at a time when scarce resources would be much better spent on education or health care , or just about anything else			1
coming to terms with this aspect of my identity has helped me to see more clearly -- with blinders off -- the ways in which i have been encouraged not to feel any connection to " them , " those labeled criminals			0
i see now that " they " are me , and i am them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			1

@entity149 says calling herself a criminal to friends starts an interesting *exchange*
many of us , even @entity108 , commit small crimes , but still think we 're good citizens , she says
@entity158 , social exclusion attach simply because you were once caught with drugs , she says
*writer* : @entity166 to our crimes gives us more *sympathy* for the convicted , *disenfranchised*
