-- you may be relieved or even ecstatic about the end of a symbol of terror , or maybe it seems like the pain is just beginning all over again			0
both of these reactions to the death of @entity11 , who was killed by @entity13 troops in @entity14 , are natural , experts say			1
from the celebrations in @entity17 and @entity18 , it looks like lots of people are happy			2
chants of " @entity13 ! @entity13 ! " reverberated outside the @entity23 and at @entity18 's ground zero as crowds celebrated the death of the terrorist leader , president @entity22 announced sunday			1
as far as the collective @entity13 psyche goes , it makes sense that this is a moment of celebration , says @entity33 psychiatrist dr. @entity32			1
the country has been experiencing emotional malaise , with a slow - moving economy , a sense of @entity13 losing its no. 1 status in the world , and a decade of pent - up anguish about the threat of terrorism			1
much like the @entity44 years , these have been uncertain times			0
then , rumors of @entity11 's death , confirmed by an announcement from the president , lifted that burden of pain and helplessness			1
" in the blink of an eye , the gloom and doom and pessimism has dissipated , " @entity32 said			0
after @entity11 : what does it mean to you ? but wait a minute : should we rejoice in the death of another human being ? but although @entity11 claimed responsibility for the destruction of the @entity67 and the deaths of thousands of @entity13 , the outpouring of celebration does n't feel right for everyone			1
@entity70 , a newspaper columnist and a contributor to @entity72 felt uncomfortable with the jubilation because he said there is a " difference between relief and euphoria			1
" " a euphoric response instead of somber relief suggests that we are celebrating revenge			2
we are not celebrating an end to the war , " he said , comparing it to the public 's euphoria when @entity44 ended			2
" what 's a little scary about this : we were once a country that saw violence as regrettable , but sometimes necessary act			2
but we 're not celebrating end of violence , but the exercise of it			0
" @entity95 , 22 , a journalism student in @entity18 who photographed the cheering crowds in @entity97 on monday morning , also felt conflicted about the celebrations he witnessed			2
" i do n't believe that any person has the right to kill anyone , and i do n't think that we should be cheering for yet more loss of life			0
however , i tell myself that in this situation , these people may be cheering for the end of an icon who led to the death of far , far too many , " @entity95 said			1
for some , @entity11 represents an idea more than a person who lived and died			1
more than the death of a human being , this ends the life of a powerful symbol of terrorism and destruction , said @entity118 , psychologist at @entity119			2
@entity11 's death hits closer to home in the @entity13 than the capture and execution of @entity124 , for example , because the @entity127 dictator did not directly attack @entity13 soil , she said			1
the celebratory mood reflects a sense that fairness and justice had been restored and that a terrorist got his comeuppance , said @entity118			0
" i think people feel like this guy got what he deserved			2
it was a sense that it was ' our family ' that was killed , " she said			0
but there are likely others who are n't chanting on the streets for whom the death of @entity11 brings back painful memories of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , she said			1
people who lost loved ones on september 11 , 2001 , may have symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder , and the killing of @entity11 may open old wounds , @entity32 said			1
" it does n't bring their loved ones back			0
it does n't ease their pain			0
there was so much more to this than catching @entity11			1
at best , they would be bittersweet : it feels good to have the relief of this guy being gone , but the pain of their loss is very strong and very real to them , " said dr. @entity162 , a @entity163 psychologist			0
is it morally right to celebrate @entity11 's death ? @entity173 , who lost her husband , @entity174 , in the @entity67 on september 11 , 2001 , said the news of @entity11 's death made her feel an " overall calm that i have n't felt in 10 years			1
" " i feel better ... like i can start a new chapter in my life			0
" @entity70 and @entity118 likened @entity11 's death to the execution of a convicted murderer of someone 's family , which may bring a sense of closure for some			1
in the case of @entity11 , though , there is fear of retaliation from terrorist groups			2
" relief also comes with a kind of sadness that the victims can never be brought back and sadness at the world that creates such a perpetrator , " @entity70 said			0
even people who did n't feel the direct impact of the attacks on september 11 , 2001 , will feel relief , @entity118 said			1
after all , everyone gets reminded of the global insecurity that resulted whenever they go to the airport			0
the terrorist leader 's living situation also does n't bring about any sympathy -- he was n't starving and struggling in a cave , but rather lived in a mansion , which adds to his perceived arrogance , @entity118 said			0
the news of @entity11 's death " allows us to put some sort of order " to the horror of 9 - 11 because otherwise , " it 's upsetting , disconcerting when we 're reminded how unpredictable life , death and the world around us could be , " said @entity213 , associate professor of psychology at @entity215			1
people 's reactions are likely tied to how emotionally and personally they felt to the events 10 years ago , @entity226 said			1
" it seems to me that the emotional reaction had a lot to do with the differences in how people view this -- whether it 's the right triumphing over evil -- a lot of young people are viewing this in that way , " @entity162 said			2
she noted that her teenage son and his friends were enthusiastically tweeting about the news in a tone that " this is a bad guy , the good guys got him finally -- that 's all they are seeing			0
" after , all @entity248 of " 24 " was trending on @entity249			0
but the one common factor was that everyone felt a need to share the news and their observations -- whether it was rallying in front of the @entity23 , or tweeting or updating their @entity258 page			0
" these emotionally charged events send us back to our social roots and make us need to affiliate with other people , " @entity226 said			0
