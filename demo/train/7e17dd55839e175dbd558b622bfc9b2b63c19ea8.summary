@entity0 -- commonly known as @entity5			1
it is even less common for an @entity8 reporter to visit this reclusive nation , home to nearly 25 million people who are essentially isolated from the rest of the world			0
yet here i am , an @entity8 member of a @entity1 crew , reporting from @entity0 about the latest high profile sporting event to sweep this city since a bizarre basketball tournament earlier this year			1
you probably remember when @entity8 @entity21 star @entity20 organized a basketball tournament in @entity0			1
@entity20 was widely criticized in the @entity8 for befriending the @entity5 's supreme leader @entity23 , whose authoritarian regime has been accused by a @entity26 panel of widespread human rights abuses , charges that @entity5 strongly denies			1
' sports diplomacy ' outside press were not invited to cover @entity20 's trip			0
this time , @entity1 is among a handful of news organizations granted rare access to @entity0 to cover the @entity34			1
retired @entity36 wrestling star turned politician @entity37 is organizing the event			1
in his professional heyday , @entity37 fought in a memorable and bizarre 1976 match in @entity41 with boxing great @entity42			2
today , as an aging member of the @entity36 parliament , he is once again in the headlines for his latest attempt at what he calls " sports diplomacy " between @entity36 and @entity5			1
@entity37 is holding the event in the home country of @entity51 , his late wrestling mentor			1
he says it will bring together professional fighters from the @entity8 , @entity55 , and several other countries			0
the wrestlers are also scheduled to tour @entity0 and interact with @entity5 fans			1
our journey so far after landing in @entity0 , we headed to our hotel , which sits on its own island			2
complete with a microbrewery , the hotel tries to give journalists on this trip a @entity4 experience , serving simple @entity4 - style omelettes and potatoes for breakfast			0
dinner was a @entity5 - style meal			2
taking a look around the city , we saw some people holding cell phones , which looked like small @entity77			0
people were n't blindly walking about with their eyes locked on the screen ; a common sight in @entity4 cities			0
these were not touch - screen phones , instead gadgets where people can access the internal net and visit certain @entity5 sites like government sites and the country 's largest newspaper			2
on friday morning , we visited the birthplace of @entity5 founder , @entity93			2
this site is considered sacred -- every @entity5 who visits the capital goes there			1
bus loads of school children , who took a 23 - hour trip from a northern rural province , arrived at the site to take a look			0
asked about how they felt about being there , the students recited facts about the place			0
even when our minders encouraged them to speak with us , it appeared they were shy or nervous facing foreigners and tv cameras			0
we headed to the @entity112 , a park with water slides and pools , that current leader , @entity23 , is said to have personally scrutinized 113 times			2
there were n't many children there , though many @entity5 families appeared to be enjoying the activities			2
the rest of friday will be spent visiting a new pediatric hospital and a sports village -- all in @entity0			2
during our tightly - controlled five - day trip , we will be under the constant supervision of government minders			0
we are staying in a hotel on an island -- in the middle of a river -- and we are n't allowed to leave without our government - assigned escorts			0
we expect them to monitor what we shoot and step - in to stop us if we point our cameras in the wrong direction			0
we expect to see only what the government will allow us to see -- the landmarks of @entity0 , omnipresent tributes to the @entity141 , and majestic displays of patriotic pageantry			2
thawing relations this unusual visit to the @entity146 comes at a time when years of frosty relations between @entity41 and @entity0 could be beginning to thaw			1
in july , @entity36 prime minister @entity149 eased several unilateral sanctions on @entity5 after the two countries made progress in talks about @entity36 citizens kidnapped by the @entity5 regime during the @entity156			1
the @entity36 government says @entity5 operatives kidnapped at least 17 @entity36 citizens in the late 1970s and early 1980s and possibly dozens more			1
in 2002 , @entity5 shocked the international community by admitting to the kidnappings and returning five victims to @entity36			1
but questions still linger about the fate of the remaining 12 confirmed abductees and the other suspected cases			0
a @entity5 " @entity169 " of about 30 government officials is expected to update the @entity36 government in the next few weeks on the status of missing @entity36 citizens			1
families of the abducted hope renewed diplomacy between the two countries will bring long - awaited answers			0
among the @entity36 sanctions lifted is a restriction asking its citizens not to travel to @entity5 , which opens the door for more @entity36 tourists to embark on commercial tours of the country			1
behind the curtain our flight on @entity5 's only airline ( one of just 10 scheduled flights a week ) was packed with mostly @entity36 press and an eclectic group of wrestlers who will tour @entity191 and entertain crowds who rarely see anything like this in their country			1
at a press conference , one @entity5 official said he hopes the event will bring the @entity5 closer to @entity36 after years of tension			1
even though decades of isolation and crippling sanctions have left @entity5 struggling economically and lagging far behind much of the developed world in terms of technology and infrastructure -- the nation is nearly unrivaled in its ability to mobilize tens of thousands of citizens to put on a spectacular show			0
it remains yet to be seen if we will get a glimpse behind the curtain to witness the true reality of life in one of the most secretive places on @entity216			0
i asked our government minders if they 'd be willing to show us what life is really like for regular people in @entity5			0
they said they 'd ask their superiors and get back to us .			0
