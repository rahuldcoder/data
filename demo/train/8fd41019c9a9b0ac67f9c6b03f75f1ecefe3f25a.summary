over the years , @entity0 have become familiar with terms such as " white " and " @entity2 " and even -- on government forms -- the more specific " non-hispanic white			1
" now , courtesy of the mainstream media , there is a new phrase to add to our national lexicon : " white @entity2			1
" i do n't like the sound of that			0
i 've written about the thorny subjects of race and ethnicity for nearly a quarter century , and i rarely hear this term			2
we might have been able to see this coming given that there is no @entity2 race and @entity2 come in all colors			2
still , mark my words			0
wherever this road leads , it 's not good -- not for @entity2 nor the rest of the country			1
the term -- white @entity2 -- emerged from the controversy over the fatal february 26 shooting of @entity32 teenager @entity31 by neighborhood watch captain @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			1
because @entity31 was black , and because it was initially assumed that @entity33 was white , critics immediately charged that the shooting was racially motivated			1
@entity33 's father , @entity39 , insisted that this was n't true			1
in fact , he said it could n't be true because his son is @entity2			2
we have since learned that @entity33 's mother is from @entity46 , and @entity33 identifies himself as @entity2			1
i 'm not about to question how @entity33 identifies himself			2
if the experience of having a president with a multiracial background who is nonetheless often referred to as simply black or @entity32 has taught us anything , it 's that people can identify themselves any way they like but that they are often too complicated to be summed up with a label			1
even so , that @entity33 's father opted to play the " hispanic card " to protect his son 's reputation is unfortunate			1
i do n't know if he ever described his son as @entity2 or half - @entity2 before the shooting			2
but it is awfully convenient that he would be so quick to describe him that way now			0
being @entity2 does n't mean you ca n't also be racist			1
and the same goes for being white , black or any other color			1
human nature dictates that we 're all a little bigoted and narrow - minded , even if it is against members of our own group			0
it 's easy to believe some stereotypes , or to think of some people as inferior to others			2
and being the member of a minority group does n't make you immune to those impulses			0
you should hear how some @entity80 - @entity0 talk about @entity80 immigrants			0
it 's not pretty , and it 's not helpful			2
and this is from people who are close enough to the subject matter that they should know better			0
but what 's even more troubling than what @entity33 's father said is that some in the media seem to be bending over backward to get a particular message across			1
rather than just refer to @entity33 as @entity2 and be done with it , they created the hybrid term white @entity2			1
my more cynical friends insist the strategy here is to preserve , by any means necessary , the narrative of a white racist who gunned down an unarmed black teenager			1
i wo n't go there			0
i do n't think my media colleagues are intentionally trying to divide people and spark racial strife			0
instead , i think they were looking for a way to avoid what would have been an embarrassing about - face			0
they did n't want to stand up and say : " we were wrong			0
without having all the facts , we made certain assumptions about the suspect			0
and now it turns out that it 's not simple , that this story is more complicated than we thought and that this suspect is both white and @entity2			1
" so they turned to the term white @entity2			1
it is also possible that some in the media are afraid to frame the story as @entity2 versus @entity32			2
relations between the nation 's largest minority and the group that used to hold that title are tense enough without adding fuel to the fire			0
whatever the reason for using this term , i do n't like it			0
and i do n't have any use for it			0
are we now going to refer to people as white @entity2 and black @entity2 ? given that my complexion is a shade lighter than brown , should i be referred to as beige @entity2 ? where does this end ? @entity0 need to discuss race and ethnicity in serious ways			1
the tragic death of a young person is a serious issue			0
everything about this story must be taken seriously			0
distorting the language shows we 're not serious people .			0
