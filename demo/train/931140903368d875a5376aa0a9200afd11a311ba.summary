" coming here this morning , seeing these wonderful facilities and beautiful surroundings -- just experiencing this extraordinary place - gave me the same feelings i had when i first went to the @entity25 , " @entity1 , who is president of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) declared			1
@entity7 's new national headquarters in the county of @entity28 is hoping to inspire its footballers and prolong the feelgood factor left by a landmark sporting summer in the @entity32 after @entity33 hosted the @entity34 and @entity35			1
crime and punishment in sport : laying down the law ? " @entity12 , and the concept that underpins it , is something totally new , " continued @entity1			1
" it will be far more than just a world class facility for training our future world - beating national team			1
" it is more than just the university from which thousands of highly qualified coaches will graduate			0
it is also a magnificent example of the sort of social initiative that brings opportunity and purpose to wider @entity32 life			0
" it will provide employment and a social hub for local people and , through the thousands of volunteers on which coaching relies , it will foster community spirit , purpose and hope throughout @entity7			2
" ‬ ‪ @entity20 chairman @entity67 hailed the facility as well as expressing his delight that the royal couple had been able to attend the grand opening			2
the opening of @entity12 is a beacon of good news for @entity76 football after a year that has tainted by the racism allegations leveled against @entity80 captain @entity79 , that prompted his international retirement			1
just last week @entity80 and @entity7 defender @entity83 called the @entity20 a " bunch of twats " after an independent report that found @entity79 guilty stated @entity83 's evidence to the inquiry had " evolved " over time			1
@entity67 revealed @entity83 had apologized in person for his tweet but was keen to focus on the potential benefits @entity12 would bring to the national team			1
" the range of functions here are so great , " @entity67 said on the organization 's website			0
" it 's a coaching center , it 's a sports science center , a rehabilitation center			2
" it 's a fantastic thing for football and for @entity20			2
this has been 20 years in development			0
" a huge amount of work has gone in to it			0
and to have our president , the @entity109 , and the @entity2 to open this facility is really fantastic			1
" there is so much built into this project			0
it 's an inspirational place as well , the pinnacle of things that are happening elsewhere around the country			0
we are trying to do so much with youth development generally , and this represents the pinnacle of that			0
" the complex mirrors similar facilities in other @entity123 countries , such as @entity125 's center of excellence at @entity127 which produced the nucleus of the team which won the @entity130 and @entity131			2
in addition to @entity127 -- which aided the development of players such as @entity135 and @entity136 -- the @entity20 also drew inspiration from @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity143 's @entity142 and @entity144 in @entity145			0
@entity76 football 's powerbrokers will hope @entity12 can help @entity7 win the @entity8 for the first time in 46 years			1
" initially we 'll get our 24 teams using @entity12 , " explained the @entity20 's director of football development @entity149			1
" you 'd like to see a youngster coming in here at 15 and get the ' wow factor ' and want to stay with the @entity7 teams throughout the age groups , @entity158 through to under - 21s and seniors			1
" @entity12 boasts 11 outdoor pitches including an exact replica of the playing surface at @entity164 , an altitude chamber to replicate playing in different climates and a 60 - meter sprint track aimed at monitoring running speed and style			1
apart from state - of - the - art facilities , what will a centralized hub offer @entity76 football which is does not have already ? " the @entity20 's locations have always been disconnected from the realities of grassroots football , " explains @entity174 , editor of @entity175			1
" they now have a location which is central to the rest of the country and accessible to a broader range of society			0
" it 's also a central location where lots of organizations are working together , which is necessary if you are going to pull out a consistent philosophy at every level of the game , which is what we are trying to do			0
" tuesday 's opening marks the end of a lengthy process for @entity76 football			1
a national soccer hub was first mooted back in the late 90s			0
many observers have highlighted the lack of a core philosophy and antiquated coaching methods as a reason for @entity7 stagnating while more technically - gifted teams like @entity143 have flourished			2
" the way football is going to progress in the country is through working together , " continued @entity174			0
" we need to create something which is bigger than the sum of its parts			0
" @entity12 can bring in more agencies which work really well together and get that out to coaches working at a grassroots level			2
" one of the key areas @entity12 will look to address is the coaching which is given to promising @entity76 talent			1
@entity174 outlined a lack a @entity224 a licensed coaches at grassroots level as a key difference between @entity7 and continental @entity123 , as well as suggesting over coaching can cause some youngsters to burn out			2
" a lot of kid 's coaching is hands off coaching , " said @entity174			0
" the more you educate a coach , the more they learn when to not step in and coach			0
" facilities , like the pitches you play on , are a big issue for technical players			0
but in coaching specifically , kids in other countries are allowed to express themselves more			0
