-- [ the following contains spoilers for the december 1 , 2013 , episode of " @entity4			1
" ] your move , " @entity7			1
" the promos all promised a deadly fall finale for " @entity4 " -- and boy , did it deliver , in one of the most shocking episodes of the series on sunday night			1
@entity14 through the episode -- despite @entity17 's pleas to the governor ( who has recently been going by the name @entity20 , though his real name is @entity22 ) to let go of his hostages , @entity24 and @entity25 , so his group and theirs can learn to coexist in the prison -- @entity24 , the wise old doctor , was brutally beheaded by the governor			1
thus began the biggest action sequence since the end of season two , with @entity17 's group of survivors ( including @entity33 and @entity34 , who just saw their own father murdered ) in a shootout with the camp the governor recently took over			2
as this was happening , the governor learned that the little girl he swore to protect , @entity39 , had recently been killed by a walker , and he shot her in the head without even flinching , to keep her from turning			2
if @entity43 dies , we riot : a chat with @entity45 it was the governor and @entity17 in hand - to - hand combat , and as soon as it looked like @entity17 was a goner , @entity25 ran the governor through with her sword , and @entity39 's mother , @entity52 -- the governor 's new girlfriend -- later finished him off			2
if that was n't enough , we saw @entity55 ( who was killed at this point in the comic books ) saved by two young girls who had been trained in using firearms by @entity61			2
speaking of @entity61 , her closest friend in the prison , @entity43 , soon got over his anger at the fact that she had been banished and went to work , using grenades and a walker 's body , to take down the governor 's people and his tank , before the members of the group abandoned the prison , before it became completely infested with walkers			2
the stunned reactions to all of this on @entity80 carried through the night , with various ( humorous , of course ) gifs of people with dropped jaws and passed out on the floor			0
celebrities weighed in as well , with " @entity88 's " @entity87 saying , " i blame @ @entity89 crying on # modernfamily till february because the tears will not stop			1
" " i am going to need a minimum of 6 - 7 months to get over this episode of @entity4 , " said actress @entity91 ( " @entity94 , " " @entity95 " )			1
" @entity100 , " tweeted @entity96 of " @entity97 , " also a regular on the " @entity99 " post-show			0
" i 'm going to bed			0
watching @ @entity103 is an hour of pure crazy cardio , " said @entity102			0
" i 'm exhausted ! one question : where 's @entity106 ? ! ! " where indeed ? the episode ended with @entity17 and @entity109 coming upon an empty baby car seat , devastated to see that little @entity111 was nowhere to be found			1
this raised the possibility that she had been killed or somehow , someone ( @entity34 ? ) was able to rescue her in the melee			0
but the question remains , why @entity24 and why now ? ( putting aside the fact that he died in the comic books at this point			0
) " it 's a very important part of the story that @entity24 died ; it is n't just shock death , " executive producer @entity121 explained to @entity122			0
" we 're going to see now with all these things taken away from @entity17 if he can come back from this			0
moving into the next season and a half , the loss of @entity24 will be felt and will be this driving element toward @entity17 's character			0
" fans will have to wait until february 9 , when the show returns , for the next chapter of the story .			1
