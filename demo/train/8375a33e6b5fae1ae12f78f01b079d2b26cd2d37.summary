but eventually his spirit for activism would have roused him out of his retirement rocker , @entity1 added			1
" i 'm sure that , if he got to be 70 , then he would have forgotten all of that : no , we have to do something now			0
and i 'm sure this is when he would have been totally activist , " @entity1 said			1

she also strolled with @entity11 through @entity31 's @entity30 , dedicated to @entity2 and named after the song " @entity34 , " written by @entity2 and fellow @entity3 @entity33			1
lovers of @entity2 's music should celebrate his 70th birthday anniversary , which occurred october 9 , by remembering his expansive spirit , @entity1 said			1
" i know that people loved him for what he has given them because he did give a lot			0
and all his beautiful ideas , they 're not like seeds in their hearts that grow : we all have this huge , huge forest of ideas that we share , " she said			0
" i would say that let 's not think about the fact that he passed away , but let 's think about , you know , we should celebrate that he was here			2
the fact that he was here really helped the world			0
" so i want people to remember that and not when he passed away			0
but of course he did pass away , and i do n't know , but by saying that i think -- concentrating on his birthday -- i think somehow i changed the kind of configuration of things , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 continues to live in the @entity71 apartment building , the @entity72 , where the couple and their son , @entity8 , lived			2
it was outside that building where @entity28 gunned down @entity2 after @entity2 had earlier given him an autograph			1
@entity1 marked @entity2 's birthday by visiting her memorial to him : the @entity82 in @entity83 , a tower made of light , which she visits every year			1
she selected the @entity89 island country " because @entity83 is the top north in the map			0

now 77 , @entity1 has been remastering @entity2 's music , and she performed with her @entity98 during @entity83 's memorial celebration			1
she recalled how she first learned of @entity2 's death -- in the hospital where he was taken for his bullet wounds			1
it 's a time she does n't care to ponder			2
" when i went to the hospital and i was waiting and the doctor came and he was carrying something of @entity2 's , like , his ring , and that 's when i thought , ah , what is it , what is it ? just funny feeling about it , and when he said that he passed away , i said no , he did n't , he 's alive , you know , very , very upset about it			1
i just refused to think that he died			0
" whenever @entity2 's murderer is up for parole , @entity1 speaks out against his release			1
" i 'm very concerned about that because , you know , he 's not a very stable person , " she said			0
she 's skeptical of any portrayal of @entity28 as a " very , very agreeable " person			1
" so now that he 's very charming or something , well , he was perfectly charming then too			0
so i do n't really have a trust for him -- for what would happen when he comes out , " she said			2
@entity28 killed @entity2 on december 8 , 1980			1
at the time , @entity2 was 40 ; @entity28 , 25			1
" well he got the autograph from @entity128 that very day , " @entity1 said			2
" you know , we were going to go to the studio , and @entity2 was a very , very astute person in that sense			2
to go to studio right ( on ) time			0
not an hour later or two hours later			0
most musicians did n't really care , but he was very prompt about those things			0
so we had the car , i got in the car , and i saw that @entity2 was still signing autographs			2
" i said , ' @entity2 , we have to go now , ' and he said , ' yeah , ok , @entity1 , ' " she added			1
forgiveness for the murder remains a difficult matter , she said			0
" well , i do n't really know , i have to think about that , " @entity1 said			1
" but @entity8 especially and me too ( are ) still living a very strong situation			0
it did n't suddenly go away			0
... so it 's a very difficult situation and we ca n't get out of it			2
" part of @entity3 lore is that @entity30 was actually an orphanage near @entity2 's childhood home , and whenever @entity2 acted like a bad boy , his mother and aunt threatened to send him there , @entity1 said			1
" he was having a love - hate relationship with @entity160			0
it was a very big thing in his life , " @entity1 said			2
" so then he made a song out of it			0
see , by having a very painful memory and changing that into a song , and then that was changed to here , into a park			0
" over the years , @entity1 has been characterized by some as the overbearing wife who caused the breakup of one of the most famous bands of the 20th century			1
born in @entity174 , she blames racism as well as sexism for the unfounded charge , she said			2
the @entity3 had long been having internal problems , she said			2
" i think i was used as a scapegoat , and it 's a very easy scapegoat , a @entity174 woman and whatever , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity182 , racism , but also just remember that the @entity183 and @entity184 were fighting with @entity174 in @entity185 " while she was stung by such characterizations , she and @entity2 went on to enjoy a full marriage			1
asked if the finger - pointing hurt her , @entity1 responded , " well , it did in a way			1
but you know , it was sort of like a distant thing in a way , because @entity2 and i were so close			2
and we were just totally involved in each other and in our work			0
" you know , " she added , " i just kept on being -- getting ideas			0
and he was , too			0
so that was much more exciting			0
