-- a professional rugby league player has been jailed for two years for a drunken assault in @entity3 , amid national soul - searching over the prevalence of alcohol - fueled violence in @entity9 society			1
@entity10 , a former @entity11 representative who plays for the @entity12 in @entity9 's @entity13 , attacked the victim during a night out drinking in @entity3 's @entity15 in november , stomping on the man 's face as he lay motionless			1
the severity of monday 's sentence apparently came as a surprise , with @entity9 media reporting that @entity10 's lawyer , @entity22 , told the judge that he had no idea jail time was being considered			1
@entity10 's long - time mentor , former player @entity25 , speculated to @entity26 that the 24 - year - old 's " harsh " sentence may have been a reaction to public concern over recent high - profile street assaults			1
the most recent victim , 18 - year - old @entity32 , was critically injured after being punched in the face in @entity3 's @entity35 nightlife district on @entity36			1
the assault , which left him in a coma with a fractured skull , occurred close to the spot where another 18 - year - old , @entity42 , was killed with a single punch in july 2012			1
@entity42 's death drew public attention to the potential damage wreaked by " king hits " -- a term widely used in @entity9 media for single , devastating punches -- and prompted the @entity52 state government to move to introduce a new " one punch " law , that will remove the legal requirement to prove assailants know a blow will kill in order to secure a conviction			1
the recent assault on @entity61 has sparked calls from doctors , politicians and victims ' families for a concerted effort to tackle the problem of street violence , including an overhaul of @entity9 society 's relationship with alcohol -- and its close association with sporting culture			1
prime minister @entity76 has weighed into the debate , urging police and the courts " to absolutely throw the book at people who perpetrate this kind of gratuitous , unprovoked violence " during an interview with an @entity9 radio station			1
he said the trend reflected the " rise of the disturbed individual			0
" @entity89 , the president of the @entity90 , told @entity0 that changing habits of alcohol consumption was essential to tackling street violence			1
" @entity9 seriously needs to think about its culture , that alcohol is connected next to nearly every gathering that occurs , " he said			2
" you would be forgiven for thinking you ca n't be successful in life , you ca n't be successful with the opposite sex , you ca n't be a successful sportsperson unless you drink			0
" he said the current regime for the responsible service of alcohol had " failed , " with " too many intoxicated people being served alcohol			0
" potential solutions included introducing early closing times , restricting the number of alcohol licenses and implementing " no re-entry " policies in hotspots for violence , as well examining the relationship between alcohol and sport			2
" all our youth are exposed to enormous amounts of alcohol advertising through sport , " he said			0
the acting leader of the @entity122 , @entity121 , called for a @entity124 inquiry into the promotion and advertising of alcohol			0
" we need to have a close look at how the promotion of alcohol is contributing to a culture of drinking in this country that is unhealthy and dangerous , " said @entity121 , a former drug and alcohol clinician			0
" perversely linking healthy pursuits like cricket and football with alcohol through sponsorship and alcohol advertising is the dark side of @entity9 sport			2
" @entity61 's family said even the widespread term " king hit " should be abandoned			0
" we do n't agree with the popular term ' king hit , ' " read a statement from the family			0
" we have heard it referred to as a coward punch , which seems more appropriate			0
" @entity153 minister @entity152 said there was " no silver bullet for alcohol - fueled violence , " but that initiatives rolled out in recent years had seen assaults in @entity157 drop 33 % last summer			2
" we will continue to work with @entity153 to curb alcohol - related violence , but individuals also need to take responsibility for their actions , " he said			2
@entity10 has launched an appeal of his sentence , which will be heard on february 11			2
his lawyer , @entity22 , did not return calls to @entity0			0
another @entity13 player , @entity168 , is currently facing assault charges after a night out in @entity157 in november .			0
