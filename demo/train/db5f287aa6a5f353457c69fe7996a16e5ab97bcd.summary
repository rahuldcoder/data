@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity4 youth movement @entity5 has called on civil society groups the length of the country to participate in a nationwide demonstration sunday			1
the youth group 's main aim is to draw massive attention to the subject of corruption in this @entity16 country , which was recently ranked at the 89th most corrupt in the world by @entity18			1
despite a government initiative to crack down on corruption with a two - year plan -- rolled out in october -- and a recent law to protects whistle - blowers , most @entity1 believe that graft is a key issue that needs to be tackled head - on			1
government initiatives are widely regarded as ineffective			0
corruption accounts for a loss of about 2 % of @entity1 's gdp , officials have said			1
more important , it deters vital foreign direct investment from flowing into @entity1 , they say			1
the 45,000 - strong movement is said to be supported by most of @entity1 's non-governmental organizations , according to press reports			1
" we call to demonstrate peacefully in all the towns to put an end to corruption , to injustice and for a real democracy in our country , " explained one youth on a video posted on the movement 's facebook page			2
the movement , which is often criticized as having been infiltrated by mainstream politicians from various parties , is expected to put as much pressure as possible on @entity52			2
he recently pledged a considerable overhaul of the country 's political setup , including the election of a prime minister , rather than appointment , and the shift of power from the capital to the regions			1
the king is widely revered in @entity1 , yet many @entity1 are skeptical about whether real reforms will be implemented in a new political landscape he hopes to unveil in mid-june , after a special constitutional commission finalizes its work on the blueprint			1
many world leaders , such as @entity73 secretary of state @entity72 and @entity75 president @entity74 , see the plan as a bold example for other @entity79 countries to follow			1
@entity80 recently said that the move represented a " model for others in the region " that holds " great promise first and foremost for the @entity1 people			2
" yet few @entity1 are so upbeat about the new constitution , as there seems to be little in it to give hope to many who want concrete initiatives to reduce corruption			2
" the main areas of concern when we talk about corruption in @entity1 are the judiciary , police and hospitals , " @entity18 's local chief @entity94 said			1
" we need a real followup to a lot of initiatives which were taken in previous years so that political corruption can no longer infiltrate the justice system			2
" judges in @entity1 are appointed by the justice minister and the king in theory but in reality are installed by their own political parties , which in turn advise them on how to conclude cases			1
" to give you an idea how bad it is in the judiciary , " @entity94 said , " we conducted a survey in 2005 and found that the majority of judges and lawyers in @entity1 have no faith in the system being free of corruption			2
we also know through our own call center that in some cases , judges can be individually persuaded with incentives			0
" despite numerous reports commissioned by the government on corruption in the judiciary , along with the establishment of an anti-fraud body and a special " accountability " court , not one prosecution has been processed against a judge			0
in 2008 , the @entity138 processed about 6,000 corruption cases across all government departments , although there were few obvious results			0
in the same year , the accountability court conducted 245 audits of national governmental offices and 198 of local authorities			0
the court 's report focused on graft in the @entity150 , the @entity151 and several local mayors			0
there were also no prosecutions by the year 's end			0
@entity5 20 hopes that sunday 's demonstrations will attract more than 300,000 people in all major @entity1 cities and present an unprecedented stand against the present rhetoric attached to the new constitution			1
but the group does n't specifically want to target corruption in government ministries			0
" we want a new constitution , which will define exactly what the new rules and regulations are in place to stop corruption , " explained @entity165 , one of the movement 's architects who edits the main @entity4 page			0
" all we have at the moment is speeches , and the laws are not working , " he said			0
" there are people in @entity1 who have become millionaires due to being given public contracts just through their contact with the king			0
but then even smaller - scale corruption , like those who ca n't get a job despite having the qualifications , is also important			0

most @entity1 believe graft is a key issue
@entity52 's plan for political overhaul *applauded* by world leaders
