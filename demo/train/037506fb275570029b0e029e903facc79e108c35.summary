editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive officer of @entity3 , @entity5 - based @entity4 , which generates much of its power from coal - burning plants and is making investments in clean energy technology in @entity10			1
@entity11 is the president of the @entity12			0
@entity13 is @entity14 representative of the @entity15			2
@entity2 , ceo of coal - burning @entity4 , wants the @entity17 to join with @entity10 against greenhouse gases			1
( @entity19 ) -- there is a lot of rhetoric on @entity23 and in our nation 's @entity27 these days portraying @entity10 as a job - stealing polluter whose economy is growing at the expense of the @entity17			1
but business leaders and policy advocates who work in @entity10 see a different picture : a @entity10 that is investing heavily in innovation and determined to win the global race to supply its citizens and the world with clean energy technologies			2
@entity10 is the largest producer of solar water heaters , with 50 percent of the world 's production and 65 percent of all installations			2
it produces 30 percent of the world 's photovoltaic sets and is installing wind turbines faster than any other nation			0
@entity10 's expanding middle class is increasingly mobile , with more than 50 million electric bicycles , and @entity10 is developing the first mass - produced plug - in hybrid electric car			2
the country has 14 nuclear power plants under construction and plans to start 10 more next year			0
although there has been much talk about creating " green jobs " in the @entity17 , @entity10 leads the world with its massive investment in energy efficiency and renewable power			1
@entity10 's growth has come with a heavy price : pollution			2
@entity10 produces 80 percent of its electricity from coal and now leads the world in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants			1
dirty air and contaminated water affect many millions of @entity10 and are two of the nation 's most serious problems			2
although the @entity17 has made great strides in reducing pollution in recent decades , we are still the world 's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions , with emissions per capita four times higher than @entity10 's			1
our nation is also heavily dependent on coal and imported oil			0
we are moving ahead in solar energy , wind and efficiency , but we are doing so in a fragmented , state - by - state approach that reflects our democracy and regulatory structures			0
by forging relationships with leading @entity10 state - owned and private energy and technology companies , @entity17 companies -- at times working with the federal government -- can create a " ladder of cooperation " with the @entity10 to lead the world forward on climate change			1
we will not climb this ladder overnight but one rung at a time			0
with the @entity104 ' climate change conference in @entity105 , @entity106 , just two months away , it is imperative that our two nations establish a more trusting , give - and - take relationship upon which good business partnerships are built			2
the @entity12 , the @entity15 and @entity4 have started this work , with great prospects for results			2
@entity12 , an independent , non-partisan environmental research organization , is working with @entity10 to calculate its greenhouse emissions as a key part of its next national @entity116 to advance its economy			2
the intent is to develop reportable and verifiable measures in the plan that could facilitate @entity10 's participation in an international climate agreement			1
@entity4 recently announced a memorandum of understanding with the @entity125 , @entity10 's largest power generator , and the @entity127 , one of the nation 's largest private energy companies			0
the focus of these efforts is to cooperatively develop and commercialize an array of clean energy technologies			0
the @entity15 -- an environmental organization advancing clean technology in the @entity17 and @entity10 -- is pivotal to @entity4 efforts			1
it has created a network of a dozen @entity10 and @entity17 companies to develop joint business ventures to build advanced , low - carbon coal technology in @entity10 and around the world			1
this network is expanding to include an array of other renewable and clean energy technologies			0
historically , @entity17 have known little about @entity10 and , at times , are justifiably concerned about its growing power and influence			1
this is changing as our trading and financial interdependencies grow			0
today , @entity10 is the largest exporter to the @entity17 and the largest holder of @entity17 debt			1
it is clearly not beneficial to either country to turn back the clock			0
there always will be healthy competition between @entity10 and the @entity17 in developing and marketing technologies , but we must work closely together to scale up and commercialize the best ideas , regardless of whether it comes from our two nations or other countries in @entity165 or @entity14 or @entity166			1
@entity10 and the @entity17 bring extraordinary and complementary skills to the table			1
@entity10 's 1.3 billion people and unmatched economies of scale can bring new technologies to market fast -- in " @entity10 time " -- at a speed that is virtually impossible anywhere else in the world			0
the @entity17 is the world 's largest economy , with an educational and technological infrastructure that is unmatched in the world , and stable energy regulation and investment policies			0
the sooner we get to work on achieving proposed congressional targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , the less expensive addressing climate change will ultimately be			1
we need to build on the emerging cooperation that exists between our two nations on energy and climate			0
we need to take responsibility for the fact that we are the world 's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases			0
if the @entity17 and @entity10 can come together to lead on addressing climate change , the rest of world will follow			1
to make this relationship work , each country should leave fear and timidity at the door , put economic self - interest to work and forge the strategic partnerships necessary to get the job done			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 , @entity11 and @entity13 .			0

authors urge 80 percent less greenhouse gas by 2050
they want big polluters @entity17 , @entity10 to cooperate
goal : create path for @entity10 participation in climate agreement , authors say
they say @entity15 to build low - carbon coal technology in @entity10
