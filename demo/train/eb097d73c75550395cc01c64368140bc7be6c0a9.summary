-- one talking point frequently used by @entity2 to justify shutting down the government while trying to overturn the @entity4 is that the @entity5 and its @entity2 majority are more representative of @entity9 ' views than president @entity10 and the @entity12 @entity11			1
that is preposterous and beside the point			0
the @entity5 @entity2 ' attempt to nullify a duly - enacted law violates the norms of our constitutional system			1
it is reckless economically and an egregious affront to our democratic form of government			0
@entity5 @entity2 have every right to press their views in @entity28 but not to threaten to blow up the @entity9 and global economy by shutting down the government and threatening public default we have elections for all three key players -- the president , the @entity5 and the @entity11			1
if @entity2 want to change the law , they must do it the old - fashioned way : persuade the others to accept their position or win control of the @entity5 and @entity11			1
@entity5 @entity2 lost ground in the 2012 elections , lost the national vote for the @entity5 by over a million votes and retained a majority only because of favorable districting			1
@entity10 won re-election by 3.9 percentage points and got an overwhelming victory in the @entity51			0
@entity52 retained their majority despite having to defend more than twice as many seats as the @entity2			1
@entity5 @entity2 represent a distinct minority of public sentiment			1
they carelessly generalize from the echo chambers of their safe districts to the national electorate			0
polls show a majority of the public opposed to shutting down the government to kill or amend @entity4			2
a majority of @entity9 also oppose its repeal or defunding			2
moreover , a significant portion of those who do n't like the law say it does n't go far enough			0
but public opinion does n't matter at this point			0
the @entity72 provides for an orderly process of making laws and building agreement between chambers of @entity28 and branches of government			2
@entity79 , extortion , hostage - taking and brinksmanship are the tools of terrorists , not legislators			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity88 .			0

@entity88 : @entity2 talking point is that the @entity5 *reflects* @entity9 ' views
he says that *'s* *wrong* : @entity4 is law ; attempts to nullify it violate the @entity72
@entity88 : @entity2 in @entity5 lost 2012 overall popular vote but kept control because of *redistricting*
he says @entity5 can press its views but not recklessly threaten @entity9 , global economy
