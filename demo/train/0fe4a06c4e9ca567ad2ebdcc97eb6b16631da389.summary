-- @entity1 famously said that 80 % of success in life is about just showing up			0
success in life -- as in diplomacy -- is about showing up at the right time			0
so is @entity8 coming to the @entity11 - @entity10 crisis too early , too late or just at the right time ? the secretary of state has been eager to get into the middle of this almost since it started			1
he considered going last weekend from @entity16 , @entity17 , where he had joined five other world powers in negotiations with @entity21 on the nuclear deal			0
but he smartly decided -- or was discouraged by the @entity23 who were in the middle of their own cease - fire mediation -- not to go			1
still , the rising number of deaths primarily on the @entity29 side and the real danger of escalation of a ground incursion left him little choice			0
regardless of the outcome , after @entity35 and @entity36 , both president @entity34 and @entity8 realized that the @entity38 could n't sit on the sidelines like a potted plant			1
@entity8 arrives in @entity11 moreover , @entity8 's hot mic comments showing his irritation at @entity11 's supposed " pinpoint " airstrikes in @entity44 revealed a good deal more frustration than simply a desire to collect more frequent flier miles			1
@entity8 is an activist and simply could n't abide the fact that people were dying and the @entity38 was n't at least trying to stop it			1
but desire and passion wo n't produce a deal			0
@entity8 proved that in his nine - month effort to negotiate an agreed framework for peace between @entity11 prime minister @entity58 and @entity60 president @entity59			1
so what will it take to negotiate a cease - fire , and is @entity8 the guy to do it ? a key question is whether the combatants now believe it is urgent to reach a cease - fire : you would think that with more than 600 @entity29 dead , thousands wounded and displaced , and @entity11 soldiers ' casualties rising , the conflict would have created an imperative for de-escalation			1
and it may eventually bring both @entity10 and @entity11 to the point that a cease - fire is a top priority			1
at the same time , @entity11 's successful @entity80 missile defense system has insulated the government to a degree from popular pressure to stand down , and the @entity38 generally has been supportive of @entity11 's right to defend itself			1
but @entity29 civilian casualties have increased international pressure			0
and tuesday 's @entity88 decision to stop flights to and from @entity11 temporarily will remind @entity11 about the costs of the continuing confrontation			2
as for @entity10 , it 's not easy to read its calculations , in part because it 's not clear whether the military or political wing is in charge			2
but it is evident that having entered this conflict financially strapped and politically weak , @entity10 leaders believe they need to show something tangible for the death and destruction their missiles have produced in @entity44			2
and , by infiltrating @entity11 through tunnels and confrontation with @entity11 in @entity44 , they have inflicted more fatalities on the @entity108 than they did in the entire three - week war of 2008/9			1
indeed , @entity10 seems convinced this fight could continue for a while longer			0
bottom line : both sides may be reaching a tipping point when pain outweighs gain			0
but they just may not be there quite yet			0
a second key question is who is in a position to mediate the deal			2
@entity8 's formidable energy and talent notwithstanding , he can not do this deal on his own			2
@entity126 has plenty of influence with @entity11 under the right circumstances but none with @entity10			2
and that means relying on regional partners who do			0
but that poses a variety of complications			0
@entity23 wants to maintain the key role here while keeping @entity138 and @entity139 at bay to limit their @entity142 leanings			0
still the deal will likely require payment of @entity10 employee salaries and the @entity138 may be the banker on that one			2
@entity23 and @entity10 will also need to work out some new arrangement to ease crossings from @entity150 -- the largest pedestrian crossing from @entity44 to @entity23			1
@entity11 also wants to limit the gains @entity10 makes			2
it wants a clean cease - fire first and only then arrangements that might satisfy some of what @entity10 is seeking			1
in the middle of this is a secretary of state who 's very much improvising in an effort to determine who has the most influence with @entity10 and how best to go about using it			1
at the end of the day , it 's no coincidence that @entity8 stopped in @entity23 first			2
@entity165 will remain the fulcrum of this process			0
the final question is what kind of deal could be achieved			0
the simplest way to conclude this round would be quiet for quiet : no more @entity10 rockets and no more @entity11 military action			2
but it 's probably too late for that kind of a cease - fire , and it would likely only be a temporary respite			1
at the other extreme are a variety of proposals from demilitarization to reoccupation of @entity44 by @entity11 to eliminating @entity10 as an organization			1
but none of these are realistic			0
the best that can be hoped for is a kind of stability for stability in which a long - term cease - fire would be followed by a number of arrangements to open up @entity44 economically in exchange for @entity10 ' commitment to stand down and ensure that there would be no attacks against @entity11 via tunnels and rockets			1
indeed @entity11 may well demand the border with @entity44 be supervised to prevent reconstruction and reuse of @entity10 ' terror tunnels			1
in exchange , a number of parties would be asked to deliver on certain commitments : @entity138 would pay promised salaries for @entity10 employees under the @entity210 - @entity10 unity accord ; @entity23 would allow the @entity150 crossing to be opened under terms to be negotiated ; @entity11 would agree to open its crossings with @entity44 , perhaps with the return -- even in a symbolic manner -- of @entity60 officials in some role in @entity44			1
@entity23 would continue to crack down on military contraband , slowing @entity10 ' capacity to rearm			0
and the @entity220 -- together with international donors -- would work to deal with the humanitarian costs of the current crisis			0
sooner or later , something along these lines will be put together			0
and @entity8 can work to assemble part of it			0
but it will be @entity23 that will drive the train , not just because of its desire to be the key actor , but also to limit the outside influences of others			0
and of all the potential mediators , including the @entity38 , @entity11 would likely prefer @entity165 , which shares its objective of limiting @entity10 gains			1
none of this will provide a long - term solution to an @entity11 - @entity10 rivalry , let alone to the broader question of how to reach a two - state solution of the @entity11 - @entity29 problem			1
but it will bring to an end another costly round of @entity11 - @entity29 violence			2
and the time for that is long overdue .			0

secretary of state @entity8 went to the @entity250 to try to end the @entity44 battle
@entity253 : need for peace is urgent , but do @entity10 and @entity11 feel time is right for deal ?
@entity38 is not in a position to mediate a solution by itself but can work with others , he says
@entity253 : it 's too late to end crisis with just a cease - fire ; a broader deal is needed
