-- it was " censorship day , " the 20th of the month , the day @entity1 , executive director of @entity3 's @entity2 , takes her stories to a government office for pre-publication scrutiny			1
normally , a report on refugees fleeing from the conflict - ravaged @entity10 would not be accepted			0
its distribution would most likely result in jail time for the author and suspension of the journal			0
but august 20 was a new day for @entity3 , the day the government rescinded repressive media censorship laws that had hindered and intimidated the country 's journalists for decades			1
still , @entity22 had her concerns			0
after nearly 50 years under the auspices of autocracy , @entity3 is shifting from the tough economic , social and political policies that have shrouded the sovereign state in global isolation			1
is now a good time to visit @entity3 ? since president @entity34 's inauguration as @entity3 's first civilian leader in half a century , the light of significant freedoms has emerged from the fog of @entity3 's military rule			2
@entity38 is stressed as " one of the most important reforms in the long run " by @entity42 , vice president of global policy programs at @entity43 , a nonprofit organization that aims to strengthen ties between the @entity45 and @entity46			1
yet , according to her , it 's " not quite completely open , but it 's certainly moving in that direction			0
" @entity45 president @entity50 voiced similar views , as his historic trip to @entity3 , also known as @entity3 , brought not only praise for the recent reforms , but also encouragement for the " greater progress that needs to be made in the future , " as he put it			1
the era of government - controlled media that banished daily newspapers , banned all forms of hard news and established pre-publication censorship is approaching the end of its long reign			2
but some journalists are still treading lightly			0
as a test of the new exemption from government review , @entity2 ran the @entity10 refugee story as their front - page article			2
@entity3 still lacks daily newspapers ; it has only weekly magazines			2
until a few months ago , weeklies could cover only " culture , arts , sports and things like that , but not hard news , " said @entity82 , founder and ceo of @entity84 , an international media development nonprofit that has clandestinely trained more than 1,000 @entity3 journalists to operate beneath the government 's radar for the past decade			1
" one of the biggest reforms that people are waiting for is the move to daily newspapers , which will probably happen in a couple months , " @entity82 said			0
who is @entity93 ? among the hurdles facing journalists is the lack of technology			0
@entity3 has the fewest cell phones of any country in the world , even fewer than @entity101 , according to @entity102 , and only 1 % of the country 's population has internet access , according to @entity106			2
despite the lack of connectivity around the country , @entity82 said , " we still trained people ( in social media ) because we saw it as an effective tool in a closed society			0
" with the lifting of press restrictions , @entity42 said , she believes people " will have greater access to @entity120 and online sources ... as the economy opens up and more telecom companies move in			0
" @entity124 and @entity125 may be more widely used when the government monopoly on telecom is liberalized , she said			0
across the border from @entity3 , in @entity130 , @entity131 , experienced journalists working for @entity84 have covertly taken in @entity3 reporters who receive training for a month or so before returning to either work clandestinely or for independent journals			1
" basically , we try to teach what language to use in reporting on conflict that will not inflame the situation -- making sure your facts are right , getting them verified , basic journalism ethics , " @entity82 said of @entity84 ' operation during @entity3 's military rule			1
when they were reporting in a closed society , @entity82 said , the @entity3 had developed their own figurative writing style to report on off - limit topics			1
@entity50 encourages ' flickers of progress ' electricity shortages are not normally the most exciting stories , but for one editor of a large @entity3 journal it 's the article he is most proud of			1
the headline read , " living in the dark , " and though he was reporting on electricity blackouts , the editor was actually alluding to @entity3 's political situation			1
boosted by the covert media training , the transition from a society mired for the past 50 years in government - controlled information to one that embraces a free press has been a smooth , yet groundbreaking path , experts say			1
the new freedoms may represent dashes instead of solid double lines , but more reforms must be made for @entity3 's press to be labeled truly open and its people completely free			1
emphasizing that @entity3 is still at the beginning of the transition , @entity42 said there is room for improvements , especially in regard to the escalating violence between @entity180 and the @entity181			1
" this a real destabilizing factor for the country that has really undermined some reforms , " she said			0
since the government loosened control of its information flow , @entity84 has set up a permanent journalism school in @entity189 , the former capital			0
there , reporters are being trained in conflict - zone journalism -- as the country continues to witness ethnic clashes -- as well as broadcast journalism to prepare for the impending telecom liberalization			2
@entity82 , recently returned from @entity3 to assess the progress of the media , described it as " the most exciting thing " he 's ever seen			2
" you just ca n't believe it -- the reforms are across the board , " he said			0
" they 've opened the door to democracy , and i do n't think they can close it again			0

one editor was *nervous* about a story landing the newspaper in trouble , but nothing happened
free press is one of the " most important reforms in the long run , " an expert says of @entity3
journalists trained to operate clandestinely make the transition to reporting openly
@entity226 - @entity225 violence could undermine the broad reforms , an expert says
