-- we watched in horror this week at the execution of an @entity5 woman who was shot nine times while a crowd of roaring men who call themselves @entity9 cheered and screamed			1
we were reminded of a similar tragedy that took place in 1999 in which a mother of five , clad in a blue burqa , was shot dead in a soccer stadium in @entity15			0
both of these women were wrongfully accused of adultery , as there was no proof , evidence , fair trial , due process or justice			0
the similarities between the two slayings signaled to us that not much has changed in @entity5 in the decade since the @entity27 first became involved there			1
when we @entity27 ask why we have failed in @entity5 , we blame the @entity5 ' antiquated tribal practices and their hate of @entity27 's freedom , and most of all , we blame their religion : @entity32			1
though we have said it over and over again , let us reiterate once more : the actions of these men were in absolute and supreme violation of @entity38 's laws , and @entity32 does not condone unmitigated violence of any kind			2
manhunt under way for @entity43 who shot woman in public execution though the @entity27 declared the promotion of women 's rights , human rights and democracy as its policy goals before invading @entity5 , it would appear that all three were lost in our efforts to establish a " secular " democracy in an @entity56			1
when our government deployed our troops intending to eliminate @entity59 and the @entity43 and establish a new government in @entity5 , we took responsibility for the future of its people			0
is it not tragic , after all the bloodshed and the billions of taxpayers ' dollars spent , that there could be a resurgence of the @entity43 and this kind of unimaginable violence ? when the @entity27 leaves @entity5 permanently , @entity5 women will undoubtedly suffer			1
throughout the past decade , our policymakers have failed to take into account the important role that religion held ( and still holds ) in the structure of @entity5 society			0
if we want to affect the way that @entity5 conceptualize important notions such as justice , we must understand the forces in their lives that guide their decisions			1
poll : religion is not the biggest enemy for @entity91 women after 30 years of constant warfare , unstable political , civil and governmental systems and a dismal education system , many @entity5 look to religious authorities to guide their actions			0
the solution to fighting extremism and affecting change in @entity5 lies within the religious system ; secular ideologies that are imposed on @entity5 are alien to them			0
having said this , @entity27 do not have to sacrifice our goals of spreading democracy and peace to the @entity5 people			1
just as our @entity107 established " @entity111 " as basic rights for all @entity27 , so too does @entity32 establish the protection and preservation of life , religion , family , intellect , property and dignity for all			1
we must look for ways in which such rights can be realized , and ways in which we can work with @entity5 to address these injustices			2
in 2006 , @entity122 founded the @entity123 ( @entity124 ) , a social justice movement that works to reclaim women 's rights in @entity32			0
its @entity127 of scholars and activists were so compelled by the level of violence against women that they published " @entity136 , " ( @entity137 ) a report that condemns both violent extremism and domestic violence			0
the response to this report , along with @entity124 's @entity140 to end violence against women in @entity5 , was overwhelming			0
many @entity5 imams confided in us that the scriptural evidence that we provided helped them to realize that they were propagating distorted and incorrect interpretations of the @entity145 , unintentionally			2
@entity146 's @entity32 : much to prove on women 's rights the value of these religious literacy trainings were so transformative that we were told , " the @entity27 government should not have spent billions ( on the war ) ; they should have spent millions and involved the imams ( with regards to women 's rights ) , and everything would have been different today			1
" similarly , an @entity5 woman told us , " imams are our only shield against the @entity43			2
" the @entity160 has forced @entity27 policymakers to acknowledge the fundamental importance of engaging with religious - political movements in the @entity164 , and efforts to include these movements are gradually making their way into our foreign policy			1
as @entity9 , we know that it is only in the religious sphere that we can achieve our vision of peace , democracy , prosperity and the realization of human and women 's rights in @entity5 , and prevent atrocities like public executions from ever happening again			0
opinion : why world must react to @entity43 execution saving face : the struggle and survival of @entity5 women the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 and @entity190 .			2

opinion : @entity27 *underestimates* importance of @entity32 in making @entity5 a better place
authors say @entity32 establishes protection and preservation of life , and dignity for all
they say the @entity27 should work with imams to *improve* lives in @entity5
