-- @entity1 , the last of six women programmers who debugged and operated the earliest general - purpose computer , has died			1
@entity1 , 86 , died wednesday in @entity5 , said @entity6 , vice president of information systems at @entity1 's alma mater , @entity10 , and director of the @entity12			1
@entity1 was profiled in a @entity0 story last month about women mathematicians who were recruited by the @entity16 military to do ballistics research during @entity18 and five of her fellow " computers " went on to program the @entity21 , but they did n't receive recognition for their work until years later			1
" @entity1 is probably one of the most significant pioneers in computing , " @entity6 said			1
" @entity1 worked hard and , as a woman in a man 's world at that time , especially in the business world , it 's amazing what she was able to accomplish			1
" @entity1 graduated from @entity10 in 1945 as the school 's one math major			1
she recalled living on her parents ' farm , refusing the teaching jobs her father suggested and avoiding all talk of marrying a farmer and having babies			0
instead , she took a train to @entity42 to work for the military			0
there , she learned ballistics calculations and was quickly hired to work on the @entity21 , created during the war by @entity47 scientists @entity48 and @entity50 @entity1 and her colleagues debugged the computer , which weighed 30 tons , contained about 18,000 vacuum tubes and completed the same work the women " computers " did but in a fraction of the time			1
@entity1 went on to work on the @entity60 and @entity61 computers and to work in the fledging high - tech publishing field			1
her children and grandchildren all grew up to be good with numbers , she said in february			0
@entity1 and the other @entity21 programmers did n't receive much attention for their work after @entity69 , but their story was recently featured in the documentary " @entity73 @entity72 : the @entity75 of @entity74 wrote an autobiography that is being edited ; @entity6 said he hopes it will be published this year			1
in 1997 , @entity1 was inducted into the @entity78 , along with her fellow @entity21 programmers , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
in 2008 , @entity1 was one of the @entity86 honorees at the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 , along with @entity90 , an inventor of @entity92 , and @entity93 , who began the development of the @entity96 kernel , or operating system			2
@entity10 opened the @entity98 in her honor			0
" i 'm going to miss her terribly			0
it 's such an end of an era , " said @entity101 , the son of @entity21 pioneers @entity103 and @entity80			2
after @entity48 's death in 1980 , @entity1 and @entity80 renewed their friendship and gave talks about their experience in the early days of computing			2
both women wrote autobiographies , @entity101 said , and remained close until @entity80 's death in 2006			2
" ( @entity1 ) was such a ball of fire and so much fun , " @entity101 said			2
" they made a great team , because my mother was more demure			0
that 's the part i remember , them traveling around like a traveling band , the @entity1 and @entity123			0
they finally got to have their own little audience			0
" " they 're going to continue to be an example of women in technology from the very beginning			0
i think ( @entity1 ) gave us what we needed to remember her by			0
" in february , @entity1 said women had n't gotten far enough in technology , but she saw a promising future			1
" women are busily working on it , " she said			0
" i have high hopes for them			0

@entity1 was among the women recruited to do ballistics calculations during @entity69
@entity1 went on to work on the @entity21 , @entity60 and *univac* machines
half a century later , their work is only beginning to get recognition
@entity1 wrote an autobiography , which editors hope will publish this year
