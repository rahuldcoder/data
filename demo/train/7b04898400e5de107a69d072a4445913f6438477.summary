-- in today 's world of catchy buzzwords , a current favorite is " @entity4 is rising			1
" @entity4 's tech scene is a soaring firebird and all the techies on the continent will tell you something game - changing is coming and @entity4 will build it			1
in case you have n't heard , apparently the next @entity14 , @entity15 or @entity16 will come from @entity4			1
that 's what the young mavericks are working towards			0
in @entity4 , we worship at the altar of innovation innovation is the fountain from which most @entity4 entrepreneurs drink -- their raison d'etre			1
this is hardly surprising on a continent that leapfrogged the tech scene , producing insanely useful mobile solutions			2
it seems it is only logical that the continent will build the next big thing			0
but innovation has become quite formulaic for the quick - talking 20 - somethings just itching to change the world			2
just like any formula , it has strict rules : find a problem , build an app to solve it , develop for smartphone and add social integration			2

the current atmosphere is electrifying with possibilities for a continent primed as an innovation and entrepreneurial destination			2
but businesses are so desperate to innovate that solid business models seem to be missing in their plans to take over the world			1
good , solid businesses are become boring , and making money is an afterthought			2
right now there is nothing sexier than @entity4 's trendy and attention - grabbing tech scene			1
it 's like the hero of a great tale : down and out , talented , with nothing to lose			0
investors make no secret that they prefer companies that are innovative , mentors recommend it and journalists dedicate headlines to the most innovative companies			0
like a ferocious monster , its appetite is insatiable and most startups are victims of it			2
at this stage we might have to rename @entity4 " the place where good companies die of too much innovation			1
" read more : " @entity4 's tallest building " set for $ 10 billion tech city i recently attended an event where a group of startups in an incubator pitched their companies after eight weeks in the program			1
one of the companies that was profitable in the beginning with a solid business model ( but which could be considered run of the mill ) had pivoted so it could do something more innovative			1
truth is , chances of the new business making money are very unlikely			2
in an environment where all the other companies around it seemed to be innovating in an interesting way with new technology , the pressure to innovate killed a good business			0
solve a real problem , damn it interestingly , @entity4 's key drivers in terms of innovation came from very simple products that wanted to solve real problems			1
the continent that brought @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity131 cloud found a real gap in the market and developed solutions for it			0
@entity4 's pool of talented developers and entrepreneurs want to prove that they can compete on the same stage with more mature markets			1
they can , but the rules are different			0
@entity4 has n't solved some of the basic problems that mature markets have solved			2
building bandwidth - heavy apps is not a good idea because the majority of the continent just is n't ready			0
as much as almost everyone in @entity4 uses a mobile device , the data problem is still a key thought			1
so perhaps , for one unimaginable moment , we should forget about building the next @entity14 , @entity15 or @entity156			0
think about using your vast technical skills ; solve the simplest problem @entity4 faces -- service delivery			1
think of the innovation that would come with that , think how very big that would be			0
hipsters do n't build boring companies in @entity4 's tech entrepreneurship scene everyone walks around like mavericks , but it is all a show			1
there is a fundamental lack of passion			0
in a bid to be different there is sameness			0
being a tech entrepreneur seems to be more about joining the sexy cool kids in the ongoing exclusive party where the tech scene is glamorized , workaholism is something to boast about and arrogance slowly becomes familiar			0
how to run a real business seems to be of very little consequence			0
more entrepreneurs need to consider bootstrapping their companies with the many free services out there until they are profitable enough to invest in more infrastructure			0
a crazy idea like that might work and even attract the much sought - after foreign investment that entrepreneurs covet			0

however , not all businesses are meant to be crazy innovators			0
some of the more successful businesses work on an old - fashioned business model that comes with a twist			0
bells and whistles or fancy technology are n't always cool , but a good , sensible way of doing business that provides jobs is			0
it 's easy to get caught up in @entity4 's tech scene , to feed its appetite for innovation , to hype up the novelty while encouraging the wannabe mavericks			1
but first , perhaps , it is time for tech entrepreneurs to ask what @entity4 needs			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			2

@entity4 entrepreneurs place too much *importance* on innovation , says @entity222
startups are *forgoing* solid business models in favor of trendy *concepts* , she says
tech wizards should first tackle the problem of service delivery
