@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday extended permission for hundreds of pilots to carry firearms -- just hours before their certification to carry the weapons was to expire , according to an organization which represents the pilots			1
" a few hundred " federal flight deck officers -- or @entity11 -- were to lose their certification to carry firearms effective midnight on @entity12 , said @entity14 , executive vice president of the @entity15			1
the loss would have come at a time of heightened concern about air security because of the attempted bombing of @entity21 on christmas day			0
but @entity14 said the @entity2 's @entity23 program notified him thursday afternoon that the pilots ' certification would be extended			1
a @entity27 official confirmed that certifications had been extended for six months " in light of recent events			1
" the official said that " due to an internal miscommunication , scheduled notifications to these officers were prematurely issued , " but he offered no further explanation			0
ffdos are commercial pilots who volunteer to undergo training so they can carry weapons to protect their aircraft			0
they undergo initial training at federal law enforcement training academies and must re-qualify with firearms every six months , and undergo a two - day recurrent training every three to five years			2
" i 'm grateful [ for the extension ] because that will keep the most cost - effective last line of defense [ of aircraft ] in place , " @entity14 said			0
" but i 'm still concerned that such a limited budget has been approved for this program , and volunteers who want to protect the @entity54 public will be turned away			1
" @entity14 said the budget for the program has not increased since 2003 , effectively capping the number of armed pilots			2
the exact number of @entity11 is classified , but government officials have said in the past the number greatly exceeds the number of federal air marshals -- plain - clothed officers who fly in the cabin of the plane to protect aircraft			1
several @entity67 contacted by @entity1 said @entity2 has made getting recurrent training onerous for pilots , limiting the number and sizes of classes			2
pilots also must pay for their own hotels and food during training -- " our own time and our own dime , " said one pilot -- placing a further burden on them			0
had the loss of certification occurred , it would not have affected the pilots ' flight clearance , only their ability to carry weapons .			0

@entity90 were to lose certification effective midnight *tonight*
certifications have been extended for six months " in light of recent events , " official says
officials have said there are more @entity11 than federal air marshals , number is classified
pilot organization concerned that limited budget will deter pilots from volunteering
