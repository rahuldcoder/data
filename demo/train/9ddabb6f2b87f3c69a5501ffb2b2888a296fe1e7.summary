-- such is the level of pressure heaped on football managers , it is unsurprising that now and then they might say or do something that gets them into trouble with someone			0
the latest incident has seen @entity13 boss @entity12 accusing @entity15 's @entity14 of " not knowing how to behave " after the @entity16 refused to shake the @entity18 's hand after the @entity21 ' 3 - 0 @entity20 defeat on wednesday night			1
it is not the first time @entity14 has made the headlines for the wrong reasons , but he is certainly not alone			1
@entity26 takes a look at football 's top - five misbehaving managers			1
@entity14 in recent years , @entity14 has been involved in touchline confrontations with @entity32 counterpart @entity31 and @entity34 's @entity33 , and exchanged words with @entity36			1
but his most bitter rivalry has been with @entity39 manager @entity38			1
for about a decade , the two clubs contested for the @entity41 , with the two coaches engaged in a volatile war of words			0
the rivalry reached a peak in 2004 when @entity39 ended @entity15 's 49 - game unbeaten streak with a 2 - 0 win at @entity49			1
after the match both coaches and players exchanged words before a slice of pizza was allegedly flung into @entity38 's face -- the incident has been referred to as ' @entity57 ' or the ' @entity58 ' ever since			1
@entity38 @entity38 's mind games over the past year have mostly been reserved for @entity62 's @entity61 and referees			1
it was a stinging criticism of the latter that has arguably caused the @entity41 's biggest controversy this season			0
after @entity39 grabbed a late equalizer at home to @entity70 , @entity38 in his post-match press conference proceeded to label referee @entity72 unfit in comparison to continental officials			2
after the threat of a lawsuit , @entity38 offered an apology -- albeit a fairly half - hearted one			2
@entity78 in his native @entity79 , @entity78 will likely be remembered for leading the country to their first major trophy since 1964 when they won @entity84			0
elsewhere it might be for when , in a training session in 2004 , he was filmed making a racially offensive remark about @entity88 in an attempt to motivate the @entity16 's then @entity15 teammate @entity90			1
the comment caused a particular storm in @entity93 , with many in the media calling for @entity78 ' job			0
he was later fined $ 3,425			0
@entity97 @entity97 has been no stranger to controversy throughout his career , and has kept up that trend since becoming @entity102 manager			0
in october he launched a scathing and foul - mouthed outburst at those who had criticized him during @entity102 's qualifying campaign			0
the rant caused @entity107 to ban him football for two months and fine him $ 24,603			0
@entity36 for all his success in football management , @entity36 is equally well - known for his brash and cocky manner , a trait that has caused fans to love and loathe him in equal measure			2
his penchant for speaking his mind has seen him accuse referee @entity118 of consorting with then @entity120 manager @entity119 at half - time during a @entity123 tie ( the official later retired due to the aftermath , having received death threats )			0
also while in charge of @entity128 , he once labeled wenger a " voyeur			1
" less verbally , he risked the ire of @entity62 fans when he proceeded to shush them during the 2005 league cup final after @entity128 scored			2
the most memorable occurrence came during the @entity137 club 's 2005 @entity123 quarterfinal versus @entity138			0
banned from the game , it was reported that @entity36 was secretly wheeled in and out of the changing - rooms in a washing basket , and that during the game he fed information to fitness coach @entity145 through an earpiece under his hat .			2

@entity12 accuses @entity14 of " not knowing how to behave " after a defeat
wenger has been involved in confrontations with several managers before
he had a fierce rivalry with @entity38 which subsided with @entity15 's declining *fortunes*
@entity36 has achieved particular notoriety , especially while at @entity128
