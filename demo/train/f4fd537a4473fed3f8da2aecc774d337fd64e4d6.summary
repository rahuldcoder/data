editor 's note : @entity2 anchors @entity3 's " @entity2 : no bias , @entity5 " at 8 p.m. et mondays through fridays			1
she delivered this commentary during the " @entity10 " segment of wednesday night 's broadcast			1
@entity3 's @entity2 says the @entity11 has audio of an executive talking about the " awards			1
" ( @entity3 ) -- and timing is everything when it comes to cashing in during the bailout			2
the soon - to - be - combined @entity19 and @entity21 's @entity20 will be doling out bonuses to its financial advisers , even as both firms take $ 60 billion of your bailout dollars			1
the bonuses , which could total $ 3 billion , will be based on the companies ' 2008 numbers , which , while bad , will almost certainly be better than this year			1
how do we all know this ? someone gave the @entity11 web site audio from a conference call where , by the way , a @entity19 executive told them not to use the " b " word			0
conference audio : " there will be a retention award			2
please do not call it a bonus			0
it is not a bonus			0
and it recognizes the importance of keeping our team in place as we go through this integration			0
" sounds like a bonus to us			0
the dictionary describes a bonus as a sum of money granted to an employee on top of their regular pay , usually in appreciation for work done , length of service , or accumulated favors			2
semantics aside , the companies have good reason to want to hide the truth			0
but in the middle of a bailout , we have good reason to call this bonus -- bogus			2
@entity77 , spokesman for @entity19 , would not confirm the authenticity of the tape , but he did defend their practice of so - called retention programs			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : banks *reportedly* giving " retention awards " to employees
she says awards are bonuses , given by firms accepting bailout money
@entity2 says that 's *wrong* , to the tune of up to $ 3 billion in bonuses
