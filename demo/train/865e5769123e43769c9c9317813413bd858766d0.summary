-- the film " @entity4 , " a @entity3 import , has kicked up a storm of controversy , mostly because of its extraordinarily long , detailed and explicit lesbian sexual and romantic scenes			1
so graphic was a roughly six - minute coupling , that the @entity12 gave the movie an nc - 17 rating , that is , no one under 17 admitted			1
but there was additional controversy when a prominent film critic suggested it could be a good movie to introduce one 's teenage daughter to			1
in a blog post on the @entity23 website about a theater in @entity25 that chose to flout the @entity12 rating , critic @entity20 said that " in some ways , because of its tone and subject matter , ' @entity27 ' is a movie that may be best appreciated by viewers under the nc - 17 age cutoff			1
" his 14 - year - old daughter had seen it twice at the @entity36			1
my take on his comment -- as a sex researcher , a university professor and a mom who has seen the film -- is : " are you kidding ? ! " i would not recommend anything so vivid portrayed by a same - sex or opposite sex couple to any young person , particularly one who was not already sexually experienced			1
furthermore , while my family is hardly shy about sharing information and opinions on all kinds of sex , it would be awkward and inappropriate to be the one introducing either my daughter or son to three highly - detailed sex scenes ( even simulated , which these are )			1
we may have frank conversations about sex , but they 're not fully illustrated , and that makes a difference ! if you have not yet sat down with your kids to look through pictures of sexual positions and intercourse , having them watch this movie would be a strange place to start			1
" @entity4 " is not family entertainment			2
its athletic , rough and tumble sexuality can look aggressive , even frightening , to an inexperienced young person , and it is hard to explain to many teens why that might also be loving			1
in a perfect world , one would want one 's child to go through stages of experiencing sex , from kissing to fondling to an intimate connection with a first lover			2
perhaps this is idealistic , but at least their exposure to vivid images of sexuality might occur over time , graduated according to what they are ready to see and understand			0
in any case , it 's certainly not something they 'd want to watch with their parents , although it 's not clear whether @entity20 actually accompanied his 14 - year - old to the @entity36 screenings			1
i am also mystified that @entity20 talks about the movie as a realistic depiction of young love that teens will identify with			2
huh ? this is not a realistic depiction for most teenagers			0
approximately 40 % to 50 % of them will not have had intercourse until they have graduated high school			0
very few of them will have had a relationship of this caliber or impact			0
how sexually explicit films affect kids is debated among health professionals and sex researchers			2
some maintain that they can encourage sexual experimentation and a change in values in young people , while others disagree -- but as a parent , why go there ? why consciously risk flipping youngsters ahead of their own experience by introducing information before they are more erotically mature ? one other reservation about taking a teen to this movie ? i love a love story ; gay , straight , bisexual or undecided			2
the chilling part of this film is that it 's basically the story of an adult woman ( she 's 5 or 6 years older ) poaching on a high - schooler			1
the issue is glossed over in the movie			0
but parents should be wary of taking their kids to see a movie that glamorizes sexual relationships between a sexy older person and a teen			0
yes , it 's only a movie			0
but it is one that can deliver a message			0
of course , there should be lots of conversations between parent and child on all these topics -- lesbian love affairs , affairs with older lovers , sexual desire when you are young -- before a child is launched into the adult world			2
but a parent exposing a child to deeply intimate sexuality -- people having oral sex together , slapping and grabbing each others ' butts and bringing each other to orgasm -- is neither necessary nor desirable			1
we can have , as sex educators call it , " a teachable moment " other ways			0
if your child does go see this film , by all means , discuss it			0
but i am pretty sure this kind of field trip would make parent and child feel they 'd had an exceptionally squeamish , and highly regrettable , experience			0

@entity192 : graphic sex in " @entity4 " causing controversy
she says @entity23 critic said film is *relevant* for young teens ; his 14 - year - old saw it
she says : you kidding ? most kids very *unprepared* for film 's level of *raw* sexuality
@entity192 : not *advisable* for a parent to introduce this kind of sex to a youngster
