" he told me she was crazy and that he denied there was an affair , " according to @entity9			2

jurors on thursday also heard from an interior designer who served as the conduit for hundreds of thousands of dollars of alleged coverup money from a wealthy @entity4 benefactor			1

prosecutors say @entity4 broke federal law by accepting about $ 725,000 from heiress @entity29 and more than $ 200,000 from @entity30 , a now - deceased @entity31 lawyer who was his finance chairman			0
the money was used to pay for @entity34 's living and medical expenses , travel and accommodations to keep the mistress out of sight while @entity4 made his second @entity41 run in 2008 , prosecutors say			1
@entity4 is accused of hiding the money from the public and the @entity43 , which polices political contributions , by filing false and misleading campaign disclosure reports			1
@entity9 ' testimony was the latest from @entity4 staffers about their former boss 's relationship with @entity34			1
@entity4 , who was married at the time , eventually admitted to having carried on an affair with the woman and fathering her child			0
a former campaign staffer said thursday that @entity4 flatly refused to sign a document in december 2007 , under penalty of perjury , declaring that he was not the father of @entity34 's child			1
@entity60 testified @entity4 had been told that if he signed the affidavit , the @entity61 might consider not running a story about his affair with @entity34			2
legal experts say that by refusing to sign the document , @entity4 demonstrated that while he was willing to lie in public about the affair , he was not willing , in this instance , to break the law			0
prosecutors reacted with surprise to the testimony , asking the witness why he never told them about this in pretrial interviews			0
@entity60 's response : prosecutors never asked about the matter			0
@entity9 , the former aide , testified he was surprised to see @entity34 at a @entity81 hotel in february 2007 because he thought her work as videographer had been completed			1
the two exchanged pleasantries in the lobby			0
@entity9 said he rode the elevator for a few floors with @entity34 before getting off to avoid a longer ride with her			0
" i would have preferred not to have seen her , " @entity9 testified			0
minutes later , @entity34 knocked on his door			0
@entity34 , according to @entity9 , " told me that she and sen. @entity4 were very much in love " and the candidate was concerned because @entity9 had seen @entity34 in the hotel			1
the aide testified he told @entity34 that " i did not care about this because i was focused on the campaign			2
" @entity9 also testified about a phone conservation involving @entity4 after a september 2007 appearance on @entity2			1
@entity4 was talking with a woman whose voice sounded like @entity34 's , according to @entity9			1
@entity4 asked the woman on the phone , " can you tell if you are showing ? " the witness said			2
earlier testimony indicated @entity34 believed she became pregnant in early may 2007			0
@entity9 also suggested that @entity4 came close to pulling out of the race after an argument with his wife , @entity113 , who has since died			1
the candidate instructed @entity9 to pull together a conference call in which @entity4 was to announce he was suspending his campaign			1
but @entity113 canceled the call , according to @entity9			0
thursday afternoon 's testimony featured @entity22 , the interior designer from @entity119 , @entity1			1
@entity22 , a longtime friend of @entity29 , said he understood money was welcomed because " mr. @entity4 needed financial support for a poverty center			1
" @entity29 also saw @entity4 as a possible presidential candidate when she started making the payments , @entity22 said			1
in all , @entity29 who will turn 102 in august , gave $ 725,000 for something @entity22 said she knew nothing about : payment for @entity34 's expenses			0
@entity22 suggested @entity29 did n't consider her donations as specifically intended for the campaign			2
the witness elicited a laugh from the courtroom audience when he admitted that @entity29 said she knew individual contribution limits the 2008 election cycle but that @entity136 considered the limits " a little low			0
" in 2008 , the @entity43 limited an individual to a contribution of $ 2,300 to each candidate or candidate committee in the primary election and $ 2,300 in the general election			0
see contribution limits for 2007 - 2008 @entity22 , who said he never took any of the money for himself , talked about how the payments were made			1
he described the process for getting cash to one of @entity4 ' key staffers , @entity152 , as a " furniture business			0
" @entity29 wrote several checks payable to @entity22 ostensibly for a table , chairs and a bookcase			0
@entity22 said he signed the checks , but instead of cashing them , he handed them over to the family of @entity152 , the prosecution 's star witness			2
@entity152 's wife , @entity162 , endorsed the checks , but signed her maiden name			0
@entity29 did n't want her lawyer to find out about the checks because he was always on the lookout for examples of @entity136 giving away too much money , according to @entity22 , who said the whole thing " just did n't feel correct			2
" @entity169 testified monday that @entity4 told her that using money from one of his benefactors to pay his mistress 's expenses was legal			1
@entity152 said that she felt " disgusted " after being asked to endorse and deposit checks from @entity136			0
@entity4 ' attorneys have said that @entity152 was involved in a ruse to extract hundreds of thousands of dollars from donors for his personal use			0
the defense argues that the money @entity4 received from @entity29 and @entity30 was for personal reasons : to protect @entity113 and his family from public humiliation			2
@entity4 has said his actions were wrong but insisted that they were not illegal .			0
