-- @entity1 made sure the lights did n't go out on its title challenge as it sparked into life with a 2 - 0 win over @entity6			1
@entity8 's 13th minute strike lit the fuse for @entity1 before @entity11 's second - half penalty sealed the win			1
@entity1 's margin of victory could have and should have been greater , but @entity11 somehow contrived to miss from six - yards with the goal at his mercy			1
@entity6 had their chances , particularly in the first - half through @entity20 and @entity21 , but they were unable to find a way past the @entity1 defence			2
@entity6 's misery was compounded in stoppage time when @entity26 was sent off after picking up a second yellow card			0
@entity11 's strike means he has now scored 152 goals in 152 appearances for the club in total and 41 in 40 matches for @entity1 in 2012			2
with just one league victory to its name before kick off , @entity1 could not afford to slip any further behind arch - rivals @entity35			1
late goals preserve @entity35 's perfect start to @entity39 season the @entity41 side sat 11 points clear of @entity1 after winning all five of their league games following its weekend victory over @entity46			1
but @entity1 moved up to seventh and to within eight points of @entity49 's side following this win			1
after the drama of sunday night where the game was postponed amid a suspected act of sabotage on the power supply at @entity56 , @entity1 wasted little time in asserting its authority			0
football : @entity1 game canceled @entity60 latched onto @entity11 's pass on the left before crossing for @entity8 to fire home from close - range			1
new signing @entity65 should have doubled @entity1 's lead 11 minutes later but he shot straight at the goalkeeper after finding space inside the penalty area			0
while @entity1 looked dangerous in attack , it remained suspect in defense and only a wonderful save by @entity73 denied @entity20 an equaliser			0
the @entity6 striker looked certain to score from close - range only for @entity73 to block and @entity21 's follow - up to be cleared off the line			0
the visitors continued to dominate after the break and @entity8 wrongly had goal ruled out after the referee inexplicably brought play back for a foul to @entity1 instead of playing the advantage			0
that decision could have proved costly for @entity86 's men , but @entity88 ' strike sailed inches over the crossbar with @entity73 beaten			2
@entity1 finally got the second goal it had been craving 20 minutes from time when @entity93 handled inside the penalty area and @entity11 stroked home from the spot			0
the @entity98 star should have wrapped the game up late on after being teed up by @entity100 , but he somehow managed to hit the post with the open goal gaping			0
there was still time for @entity26 to see red for @entity6 as the home side 's frustration boiled over following a difficult night			0
elsewhere , @entity107 claimed a 2 - 0 victory away at @entity109			1
@entity110 and @entity111 scored in the second - half to help @entity107 extend their unbeaten run to five games in the league and move to within four points of the leaders .			2

@entity1 claim 2 - 0 victory at @entity6
@entity8 and @entity11 both on target
@entity86 's side eight points *adrift* of leaders @entity35
@entity107 remain unbeaten after 2 - 0 win at @entity109
