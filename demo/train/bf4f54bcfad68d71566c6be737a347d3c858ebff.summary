" like many single women in @entity4 , @entity18 is no stranger to the dating scene -- but finding dates is n't always the problem			1
" it 's not that there are no men to date			1
it 's that i 'm not meeting anyone that i 'm attracted to			2
nobody that i think is quality and worthy of me and what i have to offer and what i want to do			2

her fear is that men are intimidated by her			1
" none of my female friends have ever said i 'm intimidating , " she says			2
" having an education , a house , a job does not make me intimidating			2
it just makes me an adult living an adult life			2
" she finds it ironic that her achievements may turn men off			1

" @entity50 also thinks men make assumptions about single women in their 30s			1
" i think they assume that if you are n't married , you want to get married , " she says			1
" instead of meeting you and approaching you in a manner that 's very basic -- ' i want to get to know you , who you are , what your likes and dislikes are ' -- i think they walk in the door expecting you to try to strong - arm them into getting married , and it scares them away			1

" i have to be very careful about who i invite into our lives			0
" @entity88 also realizes that a woman with kids is n't what every guy is looking for			1
" i do n't consider children baggage			0
i think they 're the bonus piece to the set , but there are a lot of men who do n't see it that way , " she says			1
for many women in their 30s , the pressure to get married can be intense			1
@entity18 says she is n't feeling that pressure as much anymore			0
" my original goal was to meet a man , have a family just like i grew up in , " she says			0
" but it just does n't seem to be going that way			0
" as a single mom , @entity88 says the pressure comes from people who feel like something must be missing in her life			1
" people see me as a single mom [ as if ] that 's something wrong			2
' oh , you poor thing			0
' people will do that kind of thing because they do n't feel like it 's acceptable , or that you ca n't do it on your own , " she says			0
@entity50 takes a more relaxed approach			0
" i am prepared to go with the flow as far as children and marriage are concerned , " she says			0
" i was raised in a family where a number of people , even married relatives , have chosen not to have children			2
so it 's never been the expectation that you have to get married , that you have to have children			2
it 's really more being who you are and having a happy life			0
that 's the focus for me			0
