@entity0 -- the rundown of recommended stories on some popular @entity5 social media sites showed nothing extraordinary this week until users looked a little more closely			1
on the @entity11 platform for example , the characters on the homepage had been arranged to read " @entity13 in there , @entity15 , " but only if read vertically , from top down			2
another site , 163.com , structured its homepage in a way that the first character of the top six rows of news combined to read " @entity22 ! " they were referring to the wave of anger this week against alleged government censorship at the @entity15 , a newspaper based in the southern @entity5 city of @entity28			1
for two days , journalists at the paper and hundreds of their supporters have gathered in front of the @entity15 offices holding posters calling for free speech and condemning press censorship			1
" this is an attack and suppression of press freedom and the people 's right to know the truth			1
it is not right , " said one unnamed protester			0
" i came over here to say the @entity15 is not alone , " explained another			2
some of the mostly young protesters carried flowers as a symbol of grief , while one woman came with a face mask plastered with @entity5 characters explaining it was a " biyantao , " or a condom to prevent speech			1
they demanded the resignation of @entity58 , the @entity59 propaganda chief in the southern province of @entity61 , amid claims that an editorial calling for political reform was re-written as a tribute to @entity59 rule			1
this rare protest poses a test for @entity69 , the newly installed @entity59 chief , who is just beginning to define his agenda as the paramount leader governing a massive country in a state of flux			1
it also represents a serious dilemma for the @entity59 in an era of social media and micro-blogging			1
it started with a posting on @entity81 , @entity5 's @entity82 - like social media site , complaining that the @entity83 in southern @entity61 province had rewritten the paper 's annual @entity86 's editorial without the knowledge of the editors			1
it was originally titled " @entity5 's @entity94 , " but when it was printed it was revised to read " @entity91 , " which echoed the official @entity59 line			1
the censors also added text that contained factual errors			0
soon enough @entity5 's social media witnessed a torrent of postings condemning @entity59 censorship and supporting the @entity15			1
the controversy brings to light the role of propaganda czars who supervise the flow of information in @entity5			2
to be sure , @entity5 media has become more diverse in the past three decades , thanks to @entity5 's gradual reforms and opening up			1
over the years , the local press has been given a bit more room to report about different topics and to do so differently , especially on non-political issues			0
but government censorship has never stopped and most media groups are still owned and run by the state			1
the @entity83 regularly issues written or oral directives about what news should or should not be reported and how this should be done			0
so one can only imagine the frustrations editors and journalists endure when faced with censorship			0
the @entity15 is not new to censorship - related controversy			1
over the years , it has shown a liberal leaning			0
within the allowed space , it produces stories that are relatively fresh , probing and even daring			0
" some of our essays , exposes and muck - raking stories have tried to push the margin , " said a former reporter , who requested anonymity			0
" we call them ' edge - ball ' stories , just like playing table tennis , when you make points not with hard smashes but with slight , subtle hits			0
" for that , some of its editors and reporters have gotten into trouble with the propaganda czars			0
for that , too , it has earned respect and attracted a loyal following , especially among the youth , urbanites , and intellectuals			0
on friday , foreign ministry spokeswoman @entity156 insisted there was no press censorship in @entity5 and the government protects press freedom according to the law			1
but there are apparent attempts to rein in the media , especially popular micro-blogging services , which are used to expose problems and abuses that may embarrass the government			2
meanwhile , search terms related to @entity15 are being blocked			2
just how big a threat the demonstrations pose to @entity69 's new regime remains unclear			0
it is also unclear where @entity69 stands on the issue of press censorship and free speech			2
some analysts wonder whether @entity69 or the central government supported the actions of @entity61 officials			0
some blame the row squarely on @entity58 , the newly appointed provincial propaganda chief			0
one observer in @entity61 blamed his " behavior and work style " for causing the row			0
but others see the controversy as bigger than just the @entity192 versus the @entity15			0
" it is a publicity crisis for @entity69 's new administration , " said @entity193 , a founder and editor - in - chief of @entity195 , a @entity197 - based site monitoring @entity5 's internet and media issues			2
" its political credibility and ability to lead is now being tested			0
" when the top leadership seems not resolute and clear , a smaller event moves into the national public sphere , and the state even just slightly loses control of the message in the media and internet space			0
" for the @entity213 , however , the message is clear			0
" no matter how the @entity5 media is regulated , they will never become the same as their @entity221 counterparts , " the government - backed media group said in an editorial			1
" this should be the basic judgment of @entity5 media professionals			2
" @entity5 's political system differs from the @entity225 's , and the media can not separate itself from a country 's political reality			1
the only way that fits the development of @entity5 media is one that can suit the country 's development path			2
" according to the @entity195 , the @entity83 has issued an urgent directive telling media groups at all levels that : -- state - run media is an unswerving basic principle -- the " mishap " at @entity15 has nothing to do with @entity61 propaganda chief @entity58 -- the incident 's development is due to the " meddling by hostile forces " the directive told all editors , reporters and staff to discontinue voicing their support for the @entity15 and ordered all media sites to prominently republish the @entity213 editorial .			1
