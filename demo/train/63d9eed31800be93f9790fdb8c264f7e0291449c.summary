@entity0 -- the weirdest campaign ad of this season -- maybe any season -- debuted on the @entity5 this past week			1
the ad has been nicknamed , " @entity7 , " and can be viewed here			0
the ad is an opening salvo in what will could prove the most expensive @entity12 race in @entity14 history			1
the incumbent , @entity15 , has always been the less popular of @entity18 's two @entity17 senators			1
two @entity19 declared early for the nomination against @entity15 : state sen. @entity22 and former @entity23 ceo @entity21			2
@entity21 took an early lead			2
but her performance on the campaign trail disheartened many of her supporters			0
worse , @entity21 never developed a good answer to the questions about her business career			2
portfolio magazine had dubbed @entity21 one of the 20 worst ceos of all time after a disastrous merger with @entity36			2
@entity21 was fired in 2005 after company stock dropped 60 percent in a year			2
she herself walked away with a payday estimated as high as $ 40 million			0
that history was tough to explain to hard - pressed voters			0
facing an intensifying risk of self - inflicted defeat in a winnable race , party leaders and donors enticed former state budget director @entity47 into the race			1
@entity47 immediately stepped into first place in the polls , five points ahead of @entity21 , 15 ahead of @entity52			1
the " demon sheep " ad was @entity21 's attempt to head @entity47 off at the pass			1
no description can do justice to the ad 's low - budget strangeness			1
the ad presents @entity47 as a dangerous predator with glowing red eyes , preying upon @entity21 's flock			1
never mind that it 's not usually smart tactics to represent the voters as dim - witted sheep			2
the more urgent question for @entity18 @entity19 is this : what should they make of the substance of @entity21 's attack on @entity47 ? here 's the former front - runner 's case : @entity47 presents himself as a committed fiscal conservative			1
in fact , however , he 's a career politician largely responsible for the state 's budget crisis			2
he helped write the 2005 @entity18 budget , which contained a big jump in state spending			2
he called for raising the gas tax and for sales taxes on @entity5 purchases			0
and he refused to sign the famous no - tax - increase pledge presented to all candidates by the @entity0 lobbying group , @entity89			0
he 's not the pure - hearted fiscal conservative admired by his backers : instead @entity47 is " taxing @entity47 , " a " @entity92 " : fiscal conservative in name only			1
what 's the truth ? to anyone familiar with the @entity47 record , it seems crazy that anybody would charge him with insufficient commitment to free - market causes			1
@entity47 wrote an economics dissertation under @entity104 at the @entity105			2
he ran the competition bureau at the @entity107 during the @entity109 administration			0
elected to @entity110 from @entity111 , @entity18 , in 1988 , re-elected four times , he amassed one of the most taxpayer - friendly voting records in the @entity115			0
that was the record that inspired @entity18 gov. @entity117 to hire @entity47 as state budget director in 2005			1
@entity18 's budget position was already desperate when @entity47 took the job			1
the teachers ' union had pushed through a ballot measure that directed 40 percent of all state spending to schools -- meaning every time medicaid spending rose , the schools got a raise too			0
@entity18 's " three - strikes " law -- life in prison after a third felony conviction -- had filled the state 's correctional institutions with doddering old crooks confined forever at taxpayer expense			1
reckless union contracts had pushed public - sector pay and benefits to astounding heights : over $ 100,000 for some prison guards			0
illegal immigration played havoc with state finances			0
illegal immigrants paid very little tax , but imposed as much on the state 's roads , hospitals , schools , and prisons as anybody else			0
gov. @entity117 and director @entity47 tried to address these constitutionally imposed dysfunctions in a 2005 ballot measure			0
the initiative would have enhanced the governor 's powers to cut spending growth , nullified the 40 percent guarantee to schools , and imposed across the board spending cuts if spending outpaced revenues			0
the measure , @entity165 76 , was @entity18 's last clear chance to avert the state 's present budget crisis			1
@entity18 has now plunged into the crisis that @entity117 and @entity47 foresaw and attempted to forestall			1
@entity18 is constitutionally required to balance its budget			0
without the powers contained in @entity173 76 , @entity117 and @entity47 had to make the best deal they could with the state 's interest - group dominated @entity17 legislature			1
under those awful circumstances , an increase in the gas tax was among the state 's least bad alternatives			0
@entity47 responsibly and courageously endorsed it , just as a surgeon operates on a heart patient who had earlier rejected advice to reduce his cholesterol			2
@entity21 's ad poses a powerful question			1
what does it mean to be a fiscal conservative ? @entity21 criticizes @entity47 for declining to sign a no - tax - increase pledge			1
of course , republicans have been enthusiastically signing that pledge for almost two decades now			0
the pledge did not stop them from spending money profusely			0
in fact it has turned out that a no - tax pledge can actually incentivize spending , by creating a ready - made excuse for the ensuing deficits			0
@entity21 's ad asks an apt question : what does it mean to be a fiscal conservative in the midst of the worst deficits and debts since @entity214 ? here are the tests i 'd be considering if i were a @entity18 voter : what 's your record of controlling government spending ? what are your specific plans for controlling spending in future ? in particular , how will you restrain the growth of @entity226 -- the two main drivers of federal spending ? a candidate who can answer those questions with credibility can claim to be a fiscal conservative in something more than name			1
a candidate who offers only a pledge not to increase taxes to pay for the spending for which he or she votes ? that candidate is just another @entity19 sheep			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			0

@entity21 released the " demon sheep " ad in @entity18 race for @entity12
@entity245 says it may be the strangest campaign ad ever
he says she 's *unfairly* targeting @entity47 as a fiscal conservative in name only
@entity245 says @entity47 acted responsibly to try to head off the fiscal crisis @entity18 is now in
