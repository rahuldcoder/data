-- @entity1 had big shoes to fill on monday night			1
@entity1 took over the " @entity4 " chair from former " @entity6 " alum @entity5 , who arguably had a great run as that show 's host as he crafted now - pop culture favorites like " slow - jamming the news " and " @entity12			1
" so how did @entity1 do with his debut ? the reviews are in , and they range from " meh " to middling			1
the @entity16 , which thought @entity1 got " off to a rocky start on ' @entity4 , ' " noted that the newcomer " had a few missions to accomplish when we ran into him on monday night			1
" from ' saturday night ' to ' @entity4 ' " he had to prove that @entity23 's reign is n't a fluke , that late night really can be a home for the affable and good - natured , " the @entity16 's @entity27 wrote			1
" and , most importantly , he had to show that the acute and observant brand of humor he displayed for 12 and a half years on ' @entity6 , ' many of those years spent as head writer and host of ' @entity33 , ' translates to the @entity35 format			0
" @entity23 ( we are assuming no relation to @entity5 ) said it was " mission only sort of accomplished			2
" @entity5 's debut on " @entity41 " last week was as big as his personality			2
it featured a performance by the band @entity45 and plenty of laughs with guest @entity49 and some of @entity23 's famous friends , including @entity51 and @entity52			0
@entity1 also got a little help from his friend @entity54 , who was one of his first guests along with vice president @entity56			2
@entity54 , and @entity58 's former " snl " castmate , @entity57 was also part of the show as the leader of " @entity4 's " band			2
@entity1 even paid homage to @entity23 in the form of a letter he wrote to his predecessor , and which he read during the opening of the show			0
so many nods to his " snl " past seemed to make sense to the @entity73 , which observed that @entity1 ' " monologue was reminiscent in style and cadence to his ' @entity33 ' segments , full of rapid - fire one - liners about the day 's headlines			0
" " though he lacked the giddy enthusiasm that marked @entity23 's first ' tonight ' outing last week , @entity1 frequently acknowledged the show as a work in progress , noting that a monologue joke about @entity88 had bombed with the studio audience and making fun of his low - budget graphics , " the @entity73 ' @entity81 wrote			0
@entity93 's @entity92 gave the debut a grade of " @entity96 " " i laughed at the premiere of ' @entity4 with @entity1 ' less than i laughed at ' @entity41 starring @entity5 , ' " @entity92 wrote			1
" but i laughed more at @entity1 than i did at @entity5			1
" music critic @entity98 was impressed , tweeting , " jeez , @ sethmeyers @ @entity100 makes eye contact , subtly refers to cards , responds to what guests say ... he 's , like , an actual talk show host ! " others , too , seem willing to give @entity1 some time to find his footing			0
@entity108 of the @entity109 wrote that @entity1 " eventually found his sea legs and drove his new 12:35 p.m. show to a solid , if unspectacular , debut			0
... he 's charming with a certain ' aw shucks ' demeanor that does n't seem forced or contrived , and he 'll have plenty of time to grow into his new role as a late - night host , " @entity108 said .			0

@entity1 took over from @entity5 on " @entity4 "
@entity1 got off to a slow start
one writer says @entity1 will get better
