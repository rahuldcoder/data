some of the world 's most important museums are confirming what we 've suspected all along but did n't dare say : selfie sticks are stupid			1
if ever there was a product that preyed so heavily on our fear of insignificance , it 's the selfie stick , or as i like to call it , the narcisstick			1
but wait , there 's already a selfie stick company called exactly that , because it 's witty and ironic , right ? and not painfully honest			1
more and more museums in @entity19 are announcing bans on the selfie stick			1
the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) has long removed the sticks from their exhibition halls to prevent damage to the artwork			1
if you 've ever set foot in @entity23 you 'll know what a difficult experience it can be			2
not because it is n't an exceptional art institution that 's given the world some of its most mind - expanding exhibitions			2
but because of other people			2
the @entity23 is one of the world 's busiest museums -- add selfie sticks among the crowds and you 've got a recipe for disaster			1
the same situation can be found at many famous tourist landmarks			2
the @entity49 in @entity50 received 15 million visitors last year , more than any other museum in the world			0
i used to enjoy walking the palace grounds every time i passed through the capital city -- now that everyone 's got a selfie stick , i fear for my life			1
am i being melodramatic ? let 's just say , like seat belts and extramarital affairs , the selfie stick problem does n't hit home until someone gets hurt			1
an increasing number of sites have seen the potential hazard and put a stop to things before a " tragedy " occurs			0
the @entity73 has banned selfie sticks , outside of designated selfie zones			1
use of unauthorized selfie sticks in @entity78 could get you fined			1
sports and music stadiums around @entity82 have banned the stick , as well			1
yet the real issue behind the selfie stick is the selfie itself			1
it 's somehow become socially acceptable for us to take the narcissism of adolescence and extend it thorough adulthood , manifested in selfies			0
i know i sound like a tired curmudgeon who probably does n't even know what @entity98 is and hates @entity100			0
i 'm none of those things and , yes , i do enjoy the occasional guilty pleasure of a selfie , so i ca n't and wo n't be a hypocrite about it			2
( the gallery above should prove that i understand			0
) when it comes to traveling , though , when it comes to once - in - a - lifetime visits to sacred landmarks and world - class museums or wandering side streets in strange cities , i 'd hope that we could all turn the lens away from ourselves			2
or simply put the camera away			0
travel writer @entity119 once told his readers : " i never bring a camera -- because taking pictures , i 've found , makes me less observant and interferes with my memory			0
" how much do we rely on photographs to remember our vacations ? does it really matter that we have a formal permanent documentation of every moment of our travels ? what if we entirely let go of documenting and just simply experienced ? i tried it for a day			0
it is what i imagine skydiving would be like : terrifying at first , then exhilarating and finally , when i got my mind to stop subconsciously framing every street scene , i became more present than i 've ever been on a trip			0
in any case , selfies are a cliche that have always reminded me of @entity141 as that sad old buffoon , @entity143 , taking self - portraits with his teddy bear in front of @entity147			0
instead of waving a glorified tree branch to take a slightly better version of a cliched shot , let 's just move on			0
