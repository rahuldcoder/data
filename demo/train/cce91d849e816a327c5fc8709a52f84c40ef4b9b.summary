a judge 's decision 27 years ago to throw the book at @entity3 still reverberates today			1
tuesday 's news headlines focused on an effort to save imperiled @entity7 peace talks , with a possible deal including @entity3 's release from the life prison sentence that the @entity12 naval intelligence analyst received in 1987 for providing stacks of classified documents to @entity15			1
then as now , the case involves a convergence of diplomatic , political and religious issues that strain @entity12 - @entity15 relations and evoke emotional , bordering on zealous , reactions in both countries			1
to the @entity12 intelligence and justice communities , @entity3 is a turncoat who betrayed his oath and country , not an @entity28 who acted out of allegiance to @entity15			1
@entity12 intelligence community : no early release " mr. @entity3 's apologists portray him as a sort of dual patriot : loyal to the @entity12 , but also motivated to help @entity15 , " former @entity34 lawyer and national counterintelligence official @entity33 wrote in the @entity36 in january			1
" in fact , he was primarily a venal and selfish person who sought to get rich			0
" to many @entity15 and @entity12 jews , @entity3 wanted to help a @entity12 ally by providing @entity15 intelligence information he believed the country should have			1
@entity15 has repeatedly sought @entity3 's release over past decades			1
" it is time for the @entity28 to put the @entity3 case to rest â€” not by letting him rot in prison , but by standing up against a real injustice , " said an editorial in @entity47 , an online journal dedicated to @entity50 affairs , in response to @entity33 's op - ed. will @entity12 free spy @entity3 ? on march 4 , 1987 , @entity12 district judge @entity57 rejected a plea agreement reached by federal prosecutors and @entity3 that offered the possibility of something less than the maximum life sentence in return for an admission of guilt			1
journalists covering the case believed @entity3 would get 25 years and perhaps less , with the chance for early parole , recalled @entity71 's @entity70 , whose book " @entity73 " chronicled the case			2
if he had been given the lesser sentence , @entity3 would be free today			2
maximum sentence instead , @entity57 imposed the maximum life term , meaning no chance for parole for at least 25 years			0
according to @entity70 's book , @entity57 cited the damage to @entity12 national security caused by @entity3 's leaks , as then - defense secretary @entity84 asserted in a classified memo to the court			1
in the memo , parts of which were later declassified and published in @entity70 's book , @entity84 said he sought to " dispel any presumption that disclosures to an ally are insignificant ; to the contrary , substantial and irrevocable damage has been done to this nation			0
" the memo noted that many documents that @entity3 gave @entity15 were originals that included details on sourcing and the identifications of @entity12 agents abroad , potentially putting them at risk			2
" unauthorized disclosures to friendly powers may cause as great a harm to the national security as to hostile powers because , once the information is removed from secure control systems , there is no enforceable requirement nor any incentive to provide effective controls for its safekeeping , " @entity84 's memo said , according to @entity70 's book			0
" moreover , it is more probable than not that the information will be used for unintended purposes , " the memo continued			0
" finally , such disclosures will tend to expose a larger picture of @entity12 capabilities and knowledge , or lack thereof , than would be in the @entity12 interest to reveal to another power , even to a friendly one			0
" the @entity47 editorial , however , argued that the @entity3 detractors overstated the risk created by the materials he provided to @entity15 , saying " the suggestion that passing satellite photos or communications intelligence to a friendly country is a crime on a par with causing the death of a @entity12 agent in the field defies common sense			1
" possible agreement an @entity15 official told @entity71 on tuesday that @entity3 could be released before the upcoming @entity50 holiday of @entity145 as part of an agreement to extend the @entity15 - @entity149 peace negotiations into 2015			2
under the proposal , the @entity149 would refrain from taking their case for statehood to international bodies such as the @entity154 while the talks continue , the @entity15 official said			0
meanwhile , @entity15 would release more @entity149 prisoners and limit its construction of new settlements in disputed territory , according to sources familiar with the talks			0
a @entity149 spokesman dismissed reports of any deal , and @entity12 secretary of state @entity165 also said that no agreement existed " at this point in time regarding anyone , or any specific steps , " adding " there are a lot of different possibilities in play			0
" at the @entity176 , spokesman @entity175 said @entity12 president @entity177 has made no decision on releasing @entity3			0
however , @entity175 made clear that the paramount goal remained a @entity7 peace agreement			0
" the need for and benefits of a peace between the @entity15 and @entity149 , a peace that provides the @entity149 with their own state and provides security to a democratic jewish state of @entity15 transcends ( the @entity3 ) issue and any others that are part of the discussions that we have , " @entity175 said			2
@entity15 hardliner : do n't free murderers to get @entity3 out in @entity15 , hardliners who support the release of @entity3 say it should happen as part of the @entity12 judicial process , rather than in a deal involving the release of @entity149 prisoners			1
@entity201 of the @entity202 said he opposed freeing " murderers " in exchange for @entity3 's release			1
meanwhile , a @entity12 law enforcement official told @entity71 that @entity3 effectively withdrew his parole application on tuesday by waiving a hearing			0
there was no immediate explanation for the move by @entity3 , who is eligible for parole in november 2015			0
@entity212 , a former @entity12 attorney who prosecuted @entity3 , told @entity71 's @entity213 that any decision to let @entity3 out should include a specific condition			2
" if the professional diplomats and intelligence officials do decide to release @entity3 to @entity15 , " he said , " in my opinion , it should only be on the condition that @entity15 agrees to keep him and will not try to send him back			1
" opinion : trade a spy , get @entity7 peace ?			0
