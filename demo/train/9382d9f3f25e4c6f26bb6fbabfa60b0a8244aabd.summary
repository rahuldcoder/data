@entity0 -- @entity3 is denying @entity4 access to adequate water supplies by controlling shared water resources , the human rights group @entity2 said in a report released tuesday			1
in the 100 - page report , titled " @entity8 : palestinians denied @entity15 to @entity16 , " @entity2 says @entity3 restricts @entity4 access to water through various means while making it readily available to its own citizens			1
the group accuses @entity3 of ignoring humanitarian and human rights laws , in violation of its obligations as the occupying power			0
the report says water from the shared @entity3 - @entity4 mountain aquifer is inequitably distributed , with @entity3 using more than 80 percent of it			1
the aquifer is the sole source of water for the approximately 2.5 million @entity4 in the @entity29			0
the @entity3 military has denied @entity4 access to @entity4 lands where water from the @entity35 could be accessed , the head of the @entity4 water authority told @entity1			1
" since ( 1967 ) the @entity3 authorities did not allow us to drill in the @entity39 , which is the most important shared aquifer in the @entity29 , " dr. @entity36 said			0
@entity2 argues that @entity3 also limits access to water supplies by placing restrictions on the movement of people and goods , and by enacting " a complex system of permits which @entity4 must obtain from the @entity3 army and other authorities in order to carry out water related projects " which effectively prevent the creation of needed water and sanitation projects			1
the @entity3 government rejects many of the conclusions of the @entity2 report			1
@entity59 , a spokesman for @entity3 prime minister @entity60 , called the idea that @entity3 was taking water away from the @entity4 " simply false			0
" he said that @entity3 consumption of water from the mountain aquifer had gone down in absolute terms from 1967 to today , despite the fact that @entity3 's population had more than doubled in that time to its current level of approximately 7 million people			1
a statement from the @entity3 @entity72 charges that the authors of the @entity2 report " chose to ignore @entity3 data , papers and reports , although they contain verifiable facts presented with total transparency			2
" " @entity3 has fulfilled all its obligations under the water agreement regarding the supply of additional quantities of water to the @entity4 , and has even extensively surpassed the obligatory quantity , " the foreign ministry statement said			0
" the @entity4 , on the other hand , have significantly violated their commitments under the water agreement , specifically regarding important issues such as illegal drilling ( they have drilled over 250 wells without the authorization of the @entity94 ) and handling of sewage ( the @entity4 are not constructing sewage treatment plants , despite their obligation to do so and the important foreign funding earmarked for this purpose ) , " the statement added			0
@entity2 's report notes the stark discrepancy in water use between @entity3 and @entity4 , claiming that water consumption per capita for @entity4 in the @entity29 and @entity105 is about 70 liters ( about 18 gallons ) per day , while @entity3 per capita use is 300 liters ( 79 gallons ) per day			1
in an interview with @entity1 , @entity2 researcher @entity107 said a drive through the @entity4 @entity29 shows the striking disparity in water use , with " @entity3 settlements with vast , green , well - irrigated farms and swimming pools and right next to them , @entity4 villages which are absolutely parched			2
" in @entity105 , which is home to approximately 1.5 million @entity4 , @entity107 said the water situation has reached a " crisis point			0
" she said water from the coastal aquifer , which supplies most of @entity105 , is 90 percent to 95 percent polluted and unfit for human consumption			0
@entity107 said immediate and long - term solutions were not workable under the current @entity3 and @entity123 blockade of @entity105 , which is meant to isolate the @entity125 movement , which took over @entity105 in 2007			0
@entity105 's water system , which was in a state of decay when @entity125 took power , was further damaged in the three - week war between @entity3 and @entity125 in january			0
@entity59 argued that @entity3 has provided more water to the @entity131 than it is obligated to under the @entity133 accords and that more than a third of the water transferred from @entity3 to the @entity29 was lost to theft and lack of infrastructure maintenance by @entity4			2
watch what happened to @entity105 water infrastructure in war he said the @entity4 have received " billions in aid " over the past decade and a half and invested little in their water systems , and termed " ridiculous " the notion that the mountain aquifer was only for @entity4 use			1
" @entity3 has every right to take water from that source , " @entity59 said of the mountain aquifer			2
the @entity131 was quick to seize on the findings of the @entity2 report in a statement released tuesday			0
" what is emerging today is a growing consensus over how the discriminatory water laws and practices @entity3 employs to deny @entity4 access to clean and adequate water supplies are emblematic of what amounts to a system of apartheid that underpins the entire structure of @entity3 's illegal settlement enterprise in the @entity29 , and collective punishment in the @entity105 , " said @entity4 water authority chief @entity36			2
@entity2 's report made no conclusions about what amount or percentage of water should be made available to the @entity4 , but called on @entity3 to allow @entity4 " to access and extract an equitable share of water from the shared aquifers and surface water resources in the @entity29 and @entity105			1

palestinians denied same water access as @entity3 , @entity2 says
@entity3 takes 80 percent of mountain aquifer , @entity2 report says
@entity3 says its water use declines while population jumps
@entity3 says @entity4 lose water to theft , poor infrastructure
