-- @entity1 is finally getting chromed out			2
@entity2 launched a beta version of @entity4 for @entity1 smartphones and tablets tuesday , delivering a mobile version of the popular desktop web browser after a very long wait			1
indeed , both @entity1 and @entity4 launched more than three years ago , and users have demanded unification ever since			1
why bemoan the long wait ? much like the company 's other products and services , the new @entity4 app hooks wonderfully into the @entity2 universe , giving those immersed in desktop @entity2 apps even more incentive to choose @entity1 as their mobile os. so , naturally , we would hope — nay , expect — that @entity4 would be the default browser for the @entity1 os. but this has n't been the case			1
@entity1 users have been forced to use a generic , stock browser ( unceremoniously named " browser " ) that 's inferior to not only @entity4 , but also other browsers available in the @entity30			1
@entity31 , anyone ? @entity2 had a reason to take its time : it wanted to do @entity4 for @entity1 right			1
" we did n't want to just push out @entity4 light , " said @entity37 , senior vice president of @entity4 , in an interview			2
" our goal was to get all of @entity4 onto @entity1			1
" which is exactly what @entity37 and his team did			0
it 's a full version of the @entity4 for @entity1 , still performing as adroitly as ever without losing the features that come in the desktop version			1
there are clear perks in using @entity4 instead of other @entity1 browsers			2
if you 're already a desktop @entity4 user , your bookmarks will be synced across all your browser versions after signing into your @entity2 account			1
even cooler , if you 've left pages open on your laptop at home , you can access those same open tabs from your mobile @entity4			0
search terms you 've entered on your desktop browser also carry over to @entity4 for @entity1 , saving precious time and screen tapping			1
but most important of all , @entity4 is fast			0
when typing in an address into the search bar , for instance , @entity4 predicts what page you 're going to visit and starts loading it in the browser background			2
so by the time you 've clicked " go , " most of the site has already loaded			0
to be sure , the @entity4 itself is nothing new			0
it 's been around since 2008 , when @entity2 first decided to take on @entity74 , @entity75 and others by casting its lot in the browser wars			2
the move proved to be a smart one : for nearly the past year and a half , @entity4 has slowly increased market share , according to various browser analytics firms ' estimates			2
in fact , @entity4 actually surpassed @entity87 , once the most popular alternative to the dominant @entity89 ( which still holds about 50 percent of desktop browser share )			1
after tuesday 's debut for @entity1 devices — of which there are more than 700,000 activations daily — @entity4 's adoption numbers will only escalate			1
but the @entity4 release raises a number of questions about the new browser app , and the relationship that the @entity1 and @entity4 teams have with one another			1
when the @entity4 team first announced it was creating a @entity4 - based operating system — later to be known as @entity106 — it was difficult to resolve how the software would n't come into conflict with @entity1			1
after all , @entity1 is the premier operating system for all things mobile ( smartphones , tablets )			1
except , that is , for @entity2 's version of the netbook : the @entity115			0
so the question is , which os owns what ? is it @entity4 for netbooks , and @entity1 for everything else ? @entity37 thinks there 's room enough for both operating systems			1
the @entity106 , he says , can be seen " as a different computing paradigm			0
" it 's one that , " end - to - end , is fully based on the web			0
" " native mobile applications are thriving , but web apps are going to thrive as well , " @entity37 said			0
while it 's nice to see the two camps playing nicely in tuesday 's release , it 's not without a caveat			0
as of tuesday 's launch , @entity4 for @entity1 is only available for smartphones and tablets running @entity1 version 4.0 ( a.k.a. @entity139 )			2
at this point , this includes just a handful of phones and tablets			0
and of course , it 's @entity4 " beta " for @entity1 , so do n't expect everything to work perfectly			2
still , @entity37 is confident the @entity4 team will drop the " beta " title sooner rather than later			0
" after announcing @entity4 the first time , we took it out of beta in three months , " @entity37 said			0
" i 'd expect this to happen here in the near future			0
" and as it stands , after @entity4 moves out of beta , the plan is for @entity4 to take the place of @entity1 's default browser permanently			1
if you 've got @entity139 , head to the @entity30 to download the app right now			0
