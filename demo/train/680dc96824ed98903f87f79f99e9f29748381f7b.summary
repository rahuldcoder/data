the @entity14 space agency and @entity2 's @entity15 have released a new digital topographic map of @entity17 that accurately portrays more of our planet than ever before			1
the new map consists of 1.3 million images taken by @entity1 's @entity22 satellite that have been pieced together to form a unified picture of the planet			1
the images were taken by a @entity2 imaging instrument called the @entity9 , or @entity9			1
" this is the most complete , consistent global digital elevation data yet made available to the world , " said @entity27 , a program scientist at @entity28 in @entity29			0
the map covers more than 99 percent of @entity17 's land mass from north of the @entity35 to south of the @entity37			2
during february 2000 , space shuttle @entity38 mapped about 80 percent of the planet 's surface			0
