-- with @entity2 misfiring in front of goal it was left to @entity6 defender @entity5 to grab the winner as @entity6 took closer order in the @entity10 title race sunday			1
@entity11 's @entity5 rose unmarked to head home @entity13 's free kick early in the second half to give his side a 1 - 0 win at @entity18			1
" he is having a very good season , " coach @entity19 said of the veteran defender after his team kept a third consecutive clean sheet			0
" at first he was hesitant about staying and i told him that he was important for us			0
it is no coincidence that the team has done better defensively in recent matches			0
the defenders have improved a lot			0
" with @entity32 and @entity33 drawing 0 - 0 saturday , the victory drew @entity6 to within three points of the leading duo in a three - way title race			1
@entity2 may be hot favorite to be crowned as the world 's best player at the @entity41 awards in @entity42 monday , but for once his famed finishing deserted him in this vital match for his side			1
@entity18 might have taken an early lead when @entity47 headed wide , but the visitors took command and @entity2 wasted his first chance after being set up by @entity51			1
@entity52 forward @entity51 headed just wide from a @entity53 cross just before halftime and it was @entity5 who finally found the net soon after the break			2
a second appeared inevitable when @entity2 broke clear but he was left ruefully shaking his head as @entity18 goalkeeper @entity60 made another superb save			1
another opportunity to get on the score sheet also went begging with the goal at his mercy after @entity60 had saved from @entity51			2
but in the end @entity19 's men easily held out for the victory while @entity2 will now be hoping he can get the better of @entity32 's @entity68 and @entity69 of @entity70 in the battle to be crowned as top player on the planet			2
" he 's a born winner and , despite the win , he does n't feel like he did everything that he could because he did n't score , " teammate @entity74 said of the 2008 world player of the year			2
" he knows that it was a very important win for the team			2
if i had my way , i would give it to him			0
there are a lot of people who think so around the world			0
the statistics are there to see , and he has broken almost every record out there			0
maybe this year he deserves it more than others			0
" earlier sunday , reigning @entity93 champions @entity92 claimed a club record 11th successive win to maintain an eight - point lead over @entity97 at the top			1
@entity99 scored twice for @entity92 in the 4 - 1 win at @entity101 , who had taken the lead through @entity104 after 21 minutes			1
@entity105 and @entity106 grabbed the other goals for the visitors			0
@entity110 manager @entity109 was among the crowd at the match , increasing speculation over his intentions in the latest transfer window			0
@entity97 beat @entity116 4 - 0 and third placed @entity117 , a further two points adrift , won 3 - 0 at @entity119 .			1

@entity6 win 1 - 0 at @entity18 in @entity10
