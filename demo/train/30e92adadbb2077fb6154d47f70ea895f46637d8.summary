it 's always a good idea to experiment with a few plants of several varieties to determine the ideal tomatoes for your garden and taste buds			1
what 's more , growing different varieties is an insurance policy of sorts -- a disease that strikes one variety might not harm the others			2
these are the qualities to consider when selecting tomatoes for your garden : growing basics start with healthy plants			1
whether homegrown or store - bought , plants should be short and stocky ( 6 to 10 inches tall )			1
avoid plants with blossoms or fruit			2

as a result , they will grow faster after transplanting			2
choose the right site tomatoes grow best in full sun ( at least 8 hours daily ) and well - drained soil rich in organic matter			1

this old house : organic lawn care support plants stake or cage indeterminate plants ( which develop long stems ) at the time of transplanting			1
this keeps vines and tomatoes off the ground so the fruits will be larger , cleaner and less apt to rot			0
supported plants are also easier to care for and tomatoes are easier to harvest			1
the most common method is to support each plant with a single sturdy stake , 6 to 8 feet tall and at least 1 inch thick			0
drive the stake into the ground , about 4 inches from the plant			0
as the plant grows , attach its stems to the stake using commercial tomato ties , strips of soft fabric or old panty hose			0
leave a little slack around the stems			0
the general idea with staking is to limit the vines to a couple of main stems , which requires regular pruning			0
supporting tomatoes in wire cylinders or cages is also popular			0
this method requires more work initially , but there 's no need to prune or train the plant			0
