@entity0 -- vice president @entity2 is a gaffe - prone avuncular type ; rep. @entity4 's is a wonky @entity5			1
but both men will face the same challenge at their debate on thursday : staying out of their own way			0
" @entity2 , the thing he does so well for someone his age is he has a lot of energy , " said @entity10 , a debate professor at @entity11			2
" a lot of the way he messes up is he 's so energetic , he gets wound up and he finds an inappropriate metaphor and runs with it			0
" @entity4 , she said , needs to have the same energy as @entity2 , " or it 's not going to fly			1
" moreover , @entity25 said that the conservative @entity27 chairman has to let people know he 's more than an economic expert " and a wonk " and that he can " relate to real people			2
" the two face off in the only vice presidential debate at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36			0
in light of the results of the first debate , how important is the vice presidential debate ? the visual difference alone makes for interesting television			0
" the contrast between @entity2 and @entity4 will be stark in terms of age and vitality , " said @entity42 , a professor of political management at @entity45 's @entity44			1
read @entity50 's take : is debate a game - changer ? @entity2 is a silver - haired sexagenarian with tons of energy			1
@entity4 is a younger guy who works out to @entity55 but can be a bit flat energy-wise			2
" @entity2 is comfortable in his body , and when he 's uncomfortable it shows all the more , " @entity25 said			1
" @entity4 -- the nerves can show in so many ways			2
he 's been a little stiff on the stump , particularly when @entity63 is talking			0
" @entity2 is in the role of making up for the surprising poor performance of his boss , president @entity66 , in his first debate last week			2
for @entity4 , it 's an opportunity to build on the clear debate bounce for his boss , @entity63			2
the stress of that pressure could produce some hiccups			0
@entity2 is well known for off - the - cuff remarks , while @entity4 can be rigid when pressed , political experts say			1
" this debate is more interesting because ... in the world of political theater , it 's taken on more importance , " @entity25 said			0
" when you have a staggering @entity82 , @entity80 becomes more important			0
" according to political experts , @entity66 allowed a more aggressive @entity63 to go largely unchallenged on key issues			0
@entity2 's task , political experts say , is to address those points and set @entity66 up for a stronger showing in the second of three presidential debates on tuesday			1
vp debates can kill political careers it is a task magnified by tightening polls , though the vice presidency often demands sharp political elbows , and @entity2 is an experienced debater			1
polls show size of @entity63 's post-debate bounce the question is " can @entity4 keep the momentum going in @entity63 's favor or can @entity2 blunt the damage , " said @entity105 , chairman of @entity107 's political science department			1
since @entity66 did n't aggressively push @entity63 to give details about the @entity110 plan to whittle the nation 's debt and prove that doing so wo n't shift the burden to the middle class , @entity2 will likely push @entity4 to do so , @entity105 said			1
but @entity2 must play the aggressor without coming off as a bully or slipping up with an unexpected comment			2
" the @entity118 are in a difficult situation in that they do need him to go after @entity4 on the @entity4 plan and the differences on taxes on the rich versus the middle class , " @entity105 said			2
" @entity2 will be attacking @entity4 some , but he has to be somewhat careful in that they do n't want him going over the top and committing gaffes			1
" for @entity4 , an experienced lawmaker but first - time national candidate and novice debater , the stakes are especially high , political experts say			1
@entity133 : @entity4 's debate prep as meticulous as he is " it 's hard to imagine what it 's like when there are so many lights in your face ( and so much pressure ) , " @entity25 said			1
" it 's @entity4 's opportunity to present himself to people in a party that is struggling to define itself			1
... @entity147 is long gone , and they 're still running on that mantle			0
@entity4 is saying , where do we go from there			0
" @entity4 must also defend @entity63 's positions while taking great pains not to overshadow the nominee			2
he 'll have to tread carefully in defending the @entity63 plan â € ” especially if @entity2 pushes him on his own debt plan			1
@entity4 is well aware of the challenge			0
" he raised the bar quite high , that 's for sure			0
@entity110 definitely put the pressure on from that perspective , " @entity4 said on @entity162 radio station @entity161			0
" because they had such a bad debate , @entity2 is just going to come flying at us , " @entity4 said			1
" it seems pretty clear that their new strategy is just basically to call us liars , to descend down into a mud pit and hopefully with enough mudslinging back and forth -- and distortion -- people get demoralized , and they can win by default			0
" though vice presidential debates are traditionally considered a lull between the presidential debates , this year voters can expect some fireworks , political experts say			0
@entity2 and @entity4 " can be aggressors in a way where presidential candidates are supposed to be above that fray , " @entity25 said			1
five things to watch for in vice presidential debate what questions would you ask the vp candidates ? share with us on @entity194			0
