@entity0 -- a faulty thermometer is likely to blame for rising temperatures inside a stricken nuclear reactor at the @entity8 - @entity7 plant , authorities said monday , as @entity9 prepares to mark one year since a devastating earthquake and tsunami triggered a nuclear meltdown			1
the plant 's operators , @entity15 ( @entity15 ) said temperatures inside the @entity14 have been gradually increasing since february 2 and on monday hit a high of 89.2 degrees @entity19			1
the reading is significant because an error margin of 20 degrees @entity19 for the gauges takes the temperature well above 100 degrees @entity19 , one of the pre-conditions for a " cold shutdown			1
" @entity9 declared the shattered plant was in " cold shutdown " last december , a welcome milestone in a fraught battle to contain one of the world 's worst nuclear disasters			1
should we be concerned ? a nuclear expert agreed that a faulty temperature gauge inside the @entity38 reactor is the most likely cause for the higher heat reading			1
@entity41 , a former senior operator at @entity43 nuclear power plants , told @entity1 that the prospect of another catastrophic explosion at the @entity7 is " virtually zero			2
" scientists warn of @entity48 quake threat " if the reactor was going to become critical it would have become critical in march of last year , not now , " he said			2
another possible , though less likely , explanation , according to @entity41 , is that re-routing of pipe work in the last month or so has inadvertently taken cooling water away from where it was needed			0
how has @entity15 responded ? under @entity9 nuclear safety regulations , operators are obliged to begin cooling methods when temperatures rise above 80 degrees @entity19			1
authorities at the @entity8 plant have been pumping more water and boric acid into the feed water system and into the core spray system in attempt to bring the temperature down			1
boric acid is included in the water to mop up stray neutrons			0
@entity15 said the higher reading is at odds with temperatures taken at other points within the reactor which indicates that it 's probably faulty			1
" following our cooling efforts temperatures at the two other locations are declining steadily while that at the location in question keeps rising			1
this leads us to think that the thermometer at the location in question is not functioning properly , rather than the actual temperature rising , " @entity83 , @entity15 spokesman , said monday			1
the company said it has also been analyzing gas levels within the building and says there 's been no increase in radiation , or any other reading that would indicate that the reactor is heating up			0
@entity15 said it was continuing to monitor the situation			1
what happens if the temperature gauge is correct and the reactor is heating up ? according to @entity104 , one year on from the accident the amount of residual heat and radioactivity inside all three stricken reactors is relatively low			1
" in the worst case scenario , if they were to completely lose injection and lose the cooling impact , the water in there would heat up and at some point it would begin to boil			0
and at some point they would have to get rid of that heat , but we 're talking about something that would transpire in a matter of days and weeks , not in a matter of minutes and hours , " he said			0
he said the greatest risks the reactors now pose are to the environment , and that any threats to the surrounding area pale in comparison to the devastation already delivered			0
" the biggest real risk is that a pipe breaks and that hundreds of thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water ends up underground or ends up leeching back into the ocean or something like that			0
that 's the real bottom line			0
" what is the state of the stricken reactors ? it 's been almost one year since an 8.9 - magnitude earthquake sent a tsunami on a collision course with the @entity9 coast killing more than 15,000 people , wiping out whole villages and industries and threatening nuclear mayhem			1
a hydrogen explosion then fire at the @entity8 - @entity7 plant triggered a nuclear emergency on a scale not seen since the @entity152 in the @entity153 in 1986			1
amid criticism that it was acting too slowly and indecisively in the face of disaster , @entity15 flooded three of its unstable reactors with water			2
it continues to do so while efforts continue towards long - term recovery			0
" the reactors are no more or no less stable than they were in april of last year			0
they fundamentally continue to be reliant on a feed - and - bleed cooling mechanism , " @entity104 said			0
the other three reactors at the plant were n't operational at the time of the disaster but they 've since been shutdown , as have nuclear installations across the country			1
where to now ? it 's a long road ahead , and one that the @entity9 have acknowledged could take decades to navigate			2
" they have to get the spent fuel pools stabilized and that 's largely done , " @entity104 said			0
" the next issue is going to be getting the fuel out of the reactors , the fuel that was in the reactors when the accident occurred			0
that 's probably going to be four or five years in the making , maybe even longer , " he said			0
the disaster displaced more than 100,000 people as far away as 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from the plant			0
the levels of radiation in the area closest to the plant are still dangerously high			0
@entity15 faces a staggering clean - up and compensation bill and has been forced to accept public funding to stay afloat			2
on monday , the @entity9 government approved an extra injection of 690 billion yen ( $ 8.9 billion ) for the troubled utility			2
@entity48 threatens to withhold @entity15 aid however , trade minister @entity201 has threatened to block @entity15 's access to extra funds if the company does n't grant the government sufficient voting rights .			2

@entity15 says a faulty temperature gauge may be behind higher readings
temperatures in unit 2 at the @entity8 plant have been steadily rising
the plant was declared to be in " cold shutdown " on december *16*
earthquake and tsunami caused nuclear chaos in @entity9 last march
