@entity0 , @entity1 -- a quiet lobbying campaign by a low - key man from @entity1 could determine which party controls the @entity6 next year			1
sen. @entity7 , a @entity8 , is holding private conversations with @entity6 candidates to urge them against siding with @entity11 or @entity12 before the election			1
in a narrowly divided @entity6 , this group of @entity15 could tip the balance of power -- and wield tremendous clout			1
" if you announce in advance which party you 're going to caucus with , you may as well just sign up and say i 'm one or the other , " @entity7 told @entity2			1
@entity7 recently advised @entity22 candidate @entity21 on how to be most effective running outside the two party system			1
another independent candidate , @entity24 of @entity25 , got similar pointers from @entity7 , who strongly suggested that @entity24 evade questions about which party he he will caucus with -- just as @entity7 did when he first ran for the @entity6 two years ago			1
after his 2012 election as an @entity8 , @entity7 decided to caucus with @entity11 , who currently control the @entity6			1
but he 's taking the same advice he 's giving the candidates , refusing to rule out joining republicans if they capture the @entity6			1
" i 'm not going to answer that question , " @entity7 said			2
" i 'll make that decision at the time based upon what i think is in the best interest of @entity1			0
" he added : " my first priority is to try to make the @entity6 work better and to the extent that as an @entity8 i can help to do that , that 's my goal , " said @entity7			1
@entity7 admitted he has been in talks with other moderate senators in both parties for " the past six months or so " to form a centrist caucus			2
however , he said it would be an informal group , and he does not envision breaking away any time soon from organizing around the two parties , as the @entity6 does now			2
@entity50 when @entity7 got to the @entity6 in 2013 there was only one other @entity8 , @entity52 , a proud progressive who knows how to work across the aisle , like negotiating a @entity57 overhaul			1
but @entity52 has always caucused with @entity11			0
it used to be that @entity15 were titling at windmills , almost sure to lose to either the @entity11 or @entity12 candidates			0
" the hardest thing for an @entity8 is to get across an invisible credibility line and they 're not wasting their vote , " said @entity7			2
but he crossed that invisible line in part because he had proven himself as a successful @entity8 governor here , but also because people were so desperate to send an alternative to @entity70			0
" when i was campaigning in @entity1 two years ago and people came up to me on the street they never started the conversation with health care , the @entity74 , @entity75 , or anything else			0
what they started with was ' why ca n't those people down there talk to each other and get something done ? ' " recalled @entity7			1
that overriding disgust appears more potent in 2014			0
strategists in both parties say their data show the most effective candidates this election year are those who can genuinely separate themselves from today 's partisan politics			2
that 's why candidates like @entity21 , and to a lesser extent @entity24 , a former @entity12 , are doing well , and @entity8 candidates in other states are doing well enough to make an impact on their races			1
" what i think it says is that the public is tired of the choices that they 're being given and they 're very tired of the gridlock and they 're looking for alternatives , " @entity7 told us			2
@entity106 did not endorse fellow independent @entity21 is running in a tight race against sitting sen. @entity109			2
@entity7 told @entity2 that in his conversation with @entity21 , he explained that he could n't provide an endorsement because he made a pledge not to campaign against a sitting colleague			1
still , he told @entity21 that he was happy to give him advice and is encouraged by his strong @entity8 candidacy			0
and while @entity7 is careful to say he is not sure there is a major trend towards @entity8 candidates quite yet , he openly dreams of @entity21 and @entity24 actually winning and what that would mean for the future of @entity15 in politics			1
" it 's going to encourage other people in other states who are going to say ' look there are guys in the @entity6 who are doing this and it 's not unthinkable			0
they 're getting these done , " said @entity7			0
independent - spoiler ? the reality is that @entity8 candidates in most campaigns still register in single digits at best , and are viewed by party leaders as mere spoilers taking away votes from @entity12 or @entity11 candidates			0
in the governors race here in @entity1 , if incumbent @entity12 @entity139 wins , he can likely thank @entity142 for pulling votes away from @entity145 @entity144			0
" i prefer the term winner to the term spoiler , " @entity7 said generally of the sentiment			0
" there is always a risk but you ca n't calculate these kinds of things			0
you got ta say who is the best candidate , " he added , perhaps wishfully			0
watch : all eyes on @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160			0
