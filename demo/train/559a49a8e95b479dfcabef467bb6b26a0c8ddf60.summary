-- dr. @entity2 's face lights up when he talks about his true love : the human heart			1
" the heart is really a miraculous organ			0
it beats 72 times a minute throughout our life , which means billions of times in our lifetime			0
and it never gets tired , " @entity2 says			2
" it knows exactly how much blood to pump ; it can increase its output by fivefold if we need more oxygen -- for example , if we 're running or doing strenuous activity			0
you have 5 billion cells called myocites , all beating in synchrony , in a perfectly coordinated manner , to maximize the heart 's pumping ability			0
it is an engineering feat that never ceases to amaze me			0
" @entity2 was born in @entity30 , @entity31 , the son of a general practitioner			2
he came to the @entity34 after finishing medical school in @entity31 , starting at @entity36 in @entity37			0
since 1994 , he 's been the chief of cardiology at the @entity39 , where he also directs the @entity40			1
like most physicians , @entity2 was taught that heart cells do n't regenerate , and that any cells which die from loss of oxygen during a heart attack are lost forever			1
but the lesson never quite sunk in			0
pacemaker pioneer now lives with one " that theory always struck me as odd , " @entity2 says now			2
" why would nature demand so much of a single cell , when that same cell must beat 70 times a minute throughout your life ? that seems like an unreasonable demand			0
" was it possible that new heart cells are constantly born ? and could the process be helped along to assist sick patients ? for about a decade , scientists have experimented with the use of stem cells to try and repair the heart , mostly in animals and mostly using stem cells derived from bone marrow			1
in 2009 , @entity2 was ready to launch the @entity71 trial ( @entity72 in patients with @entity74 )			1
stem cells were taken from patients with severe heart failure and multiplied in a laboratory run by dr. @entity79 at @entity80 in @entity81			1
a few months later , each patient was re-infused with a million of his or her own stem cells			1
patients saw scar tissue replaced by working heart muscle and a significant improvement in their hearts ' ability to pump blood			2
while the numbers are small , other studies have found similarly encouraging results			0
@entity2 has refined his procedure to make it less invasive -- stem cells can now be taken through a catheter -- and none of the patients in cardiac stem cell trials have suffered serious adverse effects			1
@entity2 is hoping to start a larger trial by the fall of 2013 .			2

dr. @entity2 directs the @entity40 in @entity39
in 2009 , @entity2 launched the @entity71 trial , which uses stem cells to repair hearts
patients in the trial saw dramatic improvements in their organs ' abilities
