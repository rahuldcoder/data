-- after being hidden away for years , a copy of the original " @entity7 no. 1 " comic book , featuring @entity4 and friends , will make a comeback -- to the tune of about $ 400,000 , a comic expert told @entity0 thursday			1
a @entity4 web site features @entity7 covers , including no. 1 , at left			1
starting friday , comic book collectors and @entity4 fans will have the opportunity to bid on a comic classic -- an " unrestored " copy of @entity7 no. 1 , said @entity17 , owner of @entity18 , an online liaison between comic book buyers and sellers			1
the book 's owner is not being identified			2
the auction is attracting a lot of interest			0
" one bidder wanted to trade his @entity28 for the comic book , " as part of an under - the - table deal , @entity17 joked			1
but he said the auction will remain public			0
" i could n't see myself trading in my @entity33 " -- even for a $ 375,000 car			2
why is this comic book so unique ? " of the 100 existing copies , 80 percent have been restored , but people want an untouched copy , " @entity17 said			1
the book is listed in " fine " condition , a six on the 10 - point rating scale			2
" it 's the @entity43 of comic books , " @entity17 said			2
co-created by @entity46 and @entity47 , the comic book first appeared on newsstands for 10 cents a copy in june 1938			1
nearly 12 years later , a young boy on the @entity50 found himself in a secondhand book store , where he persuaded his dad to loan him 35 cents to buy the comic book			1
until 1966 , the owner forgot about the book , which was hidden in his mother 's basement			2
since then , he 's been holding onto it , hoping to see it increase in value , @entity17 said			0
he has not been disappointed			0
" there has been a lot of interest shown on the book in the collectibles market , " said @entity17 , who predicted the comic book will sell for about $ 400,000			1
but , he added , no minimum price has been set for the auction , so " whatever it sells for , it sells for			0
" i 've known @entity7 to sell for around $ 750,000 , " comic book sales associate @entity69 said			1
" i do n't have any intention on making a bid , but i know people who do n't mind dropping several thousand for a classic comic			0
" the comic book marked the first appearances of @entity77 , @entity78 and , of course , @entity4			1
the book is in high demand because " there was no such thing as a superhero before @entity4			1
it spawned everything that came after -- like @entity87 and @entity88 , " @entity17 said			0
even during the current economic downturn , @entity17 expects the book to do well			0
those who can afford to bid , he said , " would ordinarily put money into the stock market			0
but that 's a shaky proposition			0
" these days , the comic book may even be a better investment than putting money into a cd or a bond , @entity17 speculated			1
ireport.com : would you give up your prized possession ? because the book was published at the close of the @entity105 , it contains advertisements that may appear quaint and quirky to 21st century readers			0
for only $ 1.25 , one could buy a blonde wig , a live chameleon , a whoopee cushion , a @entity114 " the size of a postage stamp " and hypnosis lessons			0
" some books seem to go in and out of fashion , " reads the auction blurb at @entity116			0
but " @entity7 no. 1 will never be one of those books			2
