in may 2013 , authorities in @entity2 's @entity1 issued a directive placing a two - child limit on @entity6 couples in two predominately @entity8 townships in the region -- in blatant disregard of the recommendations of a commission set up to investigate the recent violence between @entity14 and @entity15 in western @entity2			1
as political reforms slowly took hold in @entity2 following years under the rule of the military junta , longstanding tensions exploded into sectarian violence in @entity1 in 2012 , instigated by @entity15 against @entity6 muslims			1
hostility toward the @entity6 has deep roots , fueled by prejudicial and competing notions of the role of race and religion in @entity2 's national identity			1
successive regimes and @entity2 society at large perceive the @entity6 as a product of recent migration and @entity35 expansion from overpopulated @entity36			1
antagonism towards @entity35 has lately spiraled into @entity39 strife in other parts of the country			1
during military rule , the @entity6 were subject to a gradual process of marginalization and exclusion through discriminatory policies and restrictions , particularly in @entity48			1
denial of citizenship has legitimized arbitrary treatment against them and exacerbated hatred			0
the two - child policy emerged from this context and from local orders issued by the @entity57 and other local authorities since the early 1990s			1
the @entity57 , established as a border security force in december 1992 , was tasked , among other things , with controlling @entity6 population growth			1
restrictions on movement and regular population checks were imposed to prevent imaginary infiltrations from @entity36 , while regulating marriages and family size aimed at curbing birth rate from within			0
@entity69 : what 's behind violence ? in january 1994 , the @entity57 introduced a local order requiring official permission to marry , contradicting customary marriage practice			2
this order later included penalties for non-compliance			0
in practice , marriage authorizations can take up to several years to obtain and are only granted against the payment of bribes			0
infringement such as cohabitation or sexual contact out of wedlock can result in up to 10 years ' imprisonment			0
currently , 535 @entity6 men are serving sentences for unauthorized marriages in @entity89 , according to research by the @entity91			1
to avoid prosecution , many young women resort to induced and illegal abortion			0
local orders limiting the number of children for newly married couples were first issued by township administrations in @entity100 and @entity101 in april 2005			2
they imposed stringent conditions for applying for marriage permission and added that " those permitted to marry according to this order should control the birth rate and limit the number of children for livelihood sufficiency			2
" the number of children was not specified			0
however , the limitation was enforced when newly - married couples were asked to sign a declaration			1
initially , the pledge was no more than three children , reduced to two children in 2007			0
consequently , @entity6 women giving birth to a third child are unable to register the newborn and could be prosecuted under @entity120 of the @entity121 for disobeying orders from a civil servant , which carries a prison sentence of up to 6 months			1
most often , they become victims of never - ending extortion by local authorities			2
the @entity129 estimated that 60,000 @entity6 children are currently unregistered , born out of unauthorized as well as authorized marriages			1
some parents are too poor to cover travel expenses and bribes for birth registration , or experience administrative hurdles			0
an absent father precludes the mother from registering her baby , or the newborn is above the permissible number of births			0
unregistered children are not recorded in the family list as they do not exist administratively			0
they will not be issued with a temporary @entity146 card and will thus be unable to attend school , to apply for travel permits or ultimately to marry			0
the @entity129 report cites high birth rates among @entity6 as a key factor of insecurity among @entity153			2
it recommends family planning education to mitigate these concerns but stresses that authorities should refrain from implementing forcible birth control measures			0
lack of awareness but also poor access to family planning is prevalent , particularly in rural areas where reproductive health services are often unavailable			0
elsewhere , a growing number of @entity6 families have actually adopted birth spacing methods			2
this @entity169 directive also violates @entity2 's international obligations under the @entity171 for the elimination of @entity173 against women and the @entity171			2
in a speech on may 6 , president @entity175 pledged that his government would ensure the basic rights of @entity14 in @entity1 , enforce the rule of law and " provide genuine and decisive leadership in resolving the conflict			1
" leading pro-democracy activist and lawmaker @entity182 also condemned the two - child restriction on @entity6 couples as " discrimination not in line with human rights			1
" following international outrage , @entity189 , the president 's spokesperson , timidly responded that the government is re-examining this order			0
@entity175 's words must urgently be translated into action and he should immediately repeal the two - child policy and other discriminatory orders against the @entity6			1
if left unchallenged , more directives will be issued that could trigger renewed violence			2
join us on @entity203 / @entity202 .			0
