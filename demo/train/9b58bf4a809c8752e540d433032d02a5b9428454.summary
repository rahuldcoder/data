@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 's main center - right party has failed to form a coalition government monday , adding yet more uncertainty to the debt - ridden country 's political situation			1
@entity10 leader @entity9 said he did " everything possible " to form a coalition , but that none of the parties agreed to join with his party , which won first crack at forming a government after finishing first in sunday 's parliamentary elections			1
it will now be up to the leftist @entity21 coalition , which opposes unpopular austerity measures imposed to secure a @entity24 bailout , to form a government			1
that group will have three days to form a government			2
@entity21 leader @entity28 left little doubt sunday about what direction his party would take in a new government			1
" @entity24 leadership and especially ( @entity34 chancellor @entity33 have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat , " @entity28 said sunday			2
he called the election results " a message of a peaceful revolution			0
" sunday 's election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures imposed in @entity0			1
a @entity45 spokeswoman said monday that @entity0 needs time to work through its political process but reminded the country 's leaders that they would be expected to abide by terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown			1
" the commission hopes and expects that the future government of @entity0 will respect the engagements that @entity0 has entered into , " spokeswoman @entity52 told reporters			1
the center - right @entity57 finished first in sunday 's voting , but with just 19 % of the vote , giving it 108 seats in @entity0 's 300 - seat parliament			1
voters also delivered a rebuke to @entity66 -- @entity10 's socialist partner in the outgoing coalition government -- stripping the party of 119 seats			1
together , the parties fell short of the 50 % necessary to continue the coalition , requiring formation of a new government			1
" i asked for a strong mandate , but people chose differently			0
i respect their message , " @entity9 said sunday on state television			0
" today 's result expresses people 's disappointment toward the implemented dead - end economic policy that tested their limits and did n't include the necessary development policy			0
" @entity66 leader @entity86 said after meeting with @entity9 that his party would be willing to participate , but only in a coalition with a friendly view toward @entity24 led by a prime minister willing to renegotiate terms of the bailout deal with the @entity45			1
last year , @entity0 's debt threatened to force it to drop @entity24 's common currency , the euro , prompting the @entity96 and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding			2
in exchange , they demanded that the government slash spending			0
the resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs , wages , pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry			0
the national unemployment rate for january , the latest month for which figures are available , was nearly 22 % , prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work			0
furthermore , for the past two years , the country 's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17 - country eurozone			0
@entity0 pushed through a huge debt swap in march to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the @entity129 , the @entity96 and the @entity124 , worth â ‚ ¬ 130 billion ( $ 171.5 billion )			2
the debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc , where fears that @entity0 might collapse had increased pressure on other debt - laden nations such as @entity136 and @entity137			2
the @entity0 stock market was down about 6 % monday as concerns that sunday 's election could prompt @entity0 leaders to reconsider the deal resonated throughout @entity24			2
@entity52 , the @entity45 spokeswoman , said @entity0 needs time to form a government and said the commission stands ready to continue its assistance			1
but she said it would need to be within the framework of the second bailout			0
politicians have until may 17 to come up with a new working alliance or , if they can not , set a date for another round of elections			0
before @entity10 's failure to form a coalition , @entity9 said his party 's two priorities would be to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies , including stringent austerity measures , to " achieve development and offer people relief			1
" " i understand people 's rage , but i will not let the country ( exist ) without a government , " @entity9 said			0
@entity66 's @entity86 said he favors the formation of a unity government that is " @entity129 - oriented , regardless of what their take is " on previously implemented measures			1
his party will have 41 seats in parliament , down from 160 before the elections			2
the tribulations of @entity10 and @entity66 were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also - rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago , propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures			1
elections in @entity24 : @entity185 wins @entity187 presidency the radical leftist coalition @entity21 passed @entity66 with a strong second - place showing			1
exit polls predicted it would garner 10 % support , but instead @entity21 garnered 16.7 % , according to the results			2
that more than triples its parliamentary representation to 51 seats			0
the fourth - place finisher , the independent @entity0 party , was founded in february by ousted @entity10 member of parliament @entity199			1
with 10.6 % backing , this right - wing nationalist party , which opposes @entity0 's agreement with the @entity129 and @entity124 , will now have 33 seats in parliament			2
the @entity206 , which wants @entity0 to leave the single - currency eurozone , also saw gains in winning 8.5 % support			0
and the far - right @entity209 , which got 0.3 % of votes in the previous election , ended up with 7 % support on sunday			0
that equates to a rise from zero to 21 parliamentary seats			0
its leader , @entity216 , gave a rousing speech after sunday 's vote , saying @entity209 will " fight so that @entity0 wo n't be a slave of the memorandum and of the social jungle that illegal immigrants have brought in this country			2
" " everyone who betrays @entity226 should be afraid			0
we are coming , " he said			0
@entity228 , financial editor of the @entity0 daily newspaper @entity230 , called what happened sunday " a protest vote ( against ) the main two political parties of @entity0			1
" yet @entity228 added that she expects @entity10 and @entity66 again will be part of the ruling coalition government , even though there may be notable policy changes and challenges to come , including a " renegotiation " of the already approved austerity measures			1
" i believe that these electoral results ... show that people need a coalition government , " she said			0
" they also want the parties to cooperate			0
" @entity2 's @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .			0
