-- with a tiny land mass relative to its 8.2 million residents , the state of @entity2 is running out of room to bury its dead			1
so it 's joining an unconventional trend led by other densely packed areas : instead of burying the dead below the earth , it 's building up			1
" the idea is to create cemeteries for multilevel burial , " says @entity12 , who with his partner , @entity13 , is the architect behind 30 " high burial buildings " planned for the already crowded @entity15 outside @entity16			2
" there is simply no room			0
" each structure will be 70 feet tall			0
together they will make up what is known as a " vertical cemetery			0
" leading rabbis and the @entity2 @entity27 have even declared the stacked cemeteries kosher , due namely to clever architecture by @entity30 and team			1
" we 're not allowed to cremate the bodies or move the bones , so this is best way			0
" jewish burial law is based in part on a passage in @entity38 " for dust you are -- and to dust you shall return			2
" @entity42 law stipulates that the dead be buried separately on a layer of dust and earth			1
so while there is no restriction on multilevel burial , each body must rest on soil			0
to comply with religious law , the towers of the vertical cemetery structures have pipes filled with dirt inside their columns so that each layer is still technically connected to the ground			2
" a body is laid on earth , connected to the earth , " @entity12 says , " so the building is full of earth , every body we put inside will be on the earth			0
" despite acceptance by rabbis and the chevra kadisha , @entity2 's @entity70 burial societies , there are some @entity74 who are n't happy with the structures			1
" they prefer to do things in a traditional way , " @entity12 says , but he maintains that his structures are in some ways the most traditional			0
" it is the same as thousands of years ago when the @entity42 people created burials in caves one on top of the other			2
" today 's vertical structures have terraced sides with plants and landscaping , openings on the sides for fresh air , but coverage for visitors in inclement weather or the beating sun. it provides " a closeness and a connection between the living and the dead , " @entity12 says			0
in @entity2 , the idea of vertical cemeteries is growing			1
at the end of november , the chevra kadisha will hold a conference with the @entity27 to discuss @entity42 burial rules , and specifically vertical cemeteries such as the structures in @entity15			1
" the buildings will provide a solution to the problem of lack of burial space for more than the next two decades , " says @entity113 , a spokesman for @entity114 of @entity115			0
while the idea may seem odd to some , vertical cemeteries already exist where populations are dense and land is scarce , such as in @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and even @entity130 , where high waters make burial difficult			1
@entity133 is home to the world 's tallest vertical cemetery , the @entity136 in @entity137 , which is 32 stories high			1
in @entity141 , the @entity140 building will be split up into different sections for the four main religions practiced in @entity144 , and will be even taller .			0

@entity2 is joining other population - dense areas to build " vertical cemeteries "
@entity42 law does n't allow for cremation
@entity127 , @entity141 , @entity133 also use this kind of burial
