@entity0 -- they wanted to take the chance while they have it			1
the chance , they said , to live a life without fear			1
so they lined up wednesday at lawyers ' offices and immigration help centers to complete deferred deportation applications posted online the day before			1
this was not amnesty or immunity			1
nor was it a shortcut to citizenship or a permanent fix to their status : each was illegally in @entity23			1
but they had hope in their hearts they would be allowed to stay in the country they knew as their own			1
that they could emerge from the shadows			1
@entity31 , 20 , and @entity32 , 23 , filled out their form at @entity0 attorney @entity36 's suburban office			1
their parents brought them to the @entity23 from the @entity41 state of @entity42 many years ago			1
and they were without any documentation			2
face of hope : lining up to spend two more years in the @entity23 they finished high school in @entity48 and moved to @entity49 three years ago , where they get by working odd jobs here and there			1
they consider themselves @entity23 citizens			1
only , they 're not			2
" i did n't have a choice to come here			1
i have done nothing bad here , " @entity32 said			2
on this day , when a bold new immigration policy change went into effect , the @entity32 sisters dared to dream and found themselves tempering their emotions			2
" i 'm scared to get my hopes up , " @entity31 said			2
scared perhaps because there are no guarantees that come attached to president @entity70 's executive order signed in june			2
it allows undocumented immigrants under 30 who were brought to the @entity23 as children to apply for a temporary deferral of deportation if they are in school or have finished school			1
it allows them to obtain work permits and gives them protection that they wo n't be deported in the next two years			1
after that , @entity70 would need to sign a new order , unless legislation known as the @entity86 , which has similar provisions , is made into law by then			2
if @entity70 loses the november election , there is no guarantee that such a policy would be in place in two years , when all applicants have to renew			2
@entity95 has assured prospective applicants that their information will remain confidential and will not be used to round up other undocumented family members			1
still , the risks made some stop to wonder			2
@entity101 , 17 , was one			2
he and his brother @entity102 , 15 , listened carefully to @entity36 as he detailed the program			2
the brothers arrived in the @entity23 on tourist visas 15 years ago			1
like the @entity32 sisters , they were toddlers -- @entity101 was 3 and @entity102 just 1			2
their mother , @entity107 , wanted education and a better future for her children			0
she said she did n't worry about their legal status until she learned that they would not be able to continue their education without a government - issued @entity117 or @entity120 number			0
@entity101 , now a senior in high school , and @entity102 , a freshman , say they were not aware of their status until a couple of years ago , when they began to make plans for college			0
" i felt that after high school i did n't have anywhere to go , " @entity101 said			0
" i felt that if it was not something coming up soon i would end up back in @entity41			0
" relief from deportation yes , he was concerned about revealing his status to federal authorities			1
they would know now who he was and how to find him			0
but it was worth it			0
" whatever comes in the future is better than three months ago , " he said			0
the night before in @entity146 , thousands of people flocked to the consulates of @entity41 and @entity148 to obtain passports and other identification documents from their home countries , @entity1 affiliate @entity144 reported			0
the line wrapped around the building on 4506 @entity154 , home of the @entity41 consulate			0
@entity156 said she 'd been waiting a lifetime for this			0
what was a few hours more ? " i 've been raised here since i was four , so i 've been waiting for this day for a very long time			0
so it is worth it , " she told @entity144			0
@entity165 wanted to finally get a driver 's license , go back to school			0
so many dreams in that one line			0
there were dreams , too , floating in the swelling crowd at the offices of the @entity175 in @entity176			0
the immigrant rights group expected about 1,000 people to show up wednesday			0
it 's estimated that just in the @entity176 school district alone , 218,000 young immigrants are eligible to apply			1
@entity70 's executive order brought thousands relief but many are painfully aware of their sharpest critics who say deferred deportations and the @entity86 are a form of backdoor amnesty			1
what also cuts , they said , are charges that illegal immigrants will take jobs away from rightful @entity23			1
everyone has an opinion , said @entity196 , 23 , who came to the @entity23 from @entity41 when he was 11			1
but standing in line wednesday , @entity196 offered this thought : there were some jobs that most people do n't want but immigrants are willing to take			1
and that immigrants work just as hard			1
" we are like everyone else too , " he said			0
" in @entity208 , @entity207 , 17 , just finished high school			0
he flipped through the form and spoke of how the six years he has been here has transformed			0
he feels much more @entity23 now than @entity41			1
i have a lot to contribute , " he said			0
he hoped his deportation deferment application would be processed quickly so he can see his parents again			1
they felt worn down by the economic downturn and the stress of their illegal status and finally went back to @entity41 this year			0
they were not there to see their son stand on a stage and graduate at the top of his class			0
@entity207 hoped that the next time he saw his mother and father , he would be enrolled in college			0
it was another dream that the immigration policy change could help come true			0
five things to know about the changes in immigration policy @entity1 's @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			0

this was not amnesty or a fast track to citizenship
but deportation deferral allows young undocumented immigrants to stay , work in the @entity23
many said they were brought here as babies and did not have a choice
some worried about divulging information to authorities
