-- @entity1 was one of an estimated half - million patients in the @entity3 who were unable to get the drugs they needed because of shortages			1
" you feel like you 're in a fight with one hand tied behind your back , " said @entity1 , 56			1
it was a fight she lost in june			2
according to the @entity13 , the number of drug shortages has increased nearly 300 % since 2005			1
more than half of the drugs on the shortage list are considered critical -- meaning they have no alternative			0
the drugs most often in short supply include anesthetics and oncological drugs			0
@entity1 was diagnosed in 2006 with ovarian cancer , the fifth - deadliest cancer for women , according to the @entity26			1
surgery and treatment were able to keep her tumors at bay until 2009 , when she returned to surgery			0
she was back in remission until june 2011 , when her cancer appeared once again			2
@entity1 was able to get her required surgery , but her doctor , dr. @entity34 , was unable to get @entity35 , the chemotherapy treatment she needed			1
' a huge , growing crisis in this country ' " this is a huge , growing crisis in this country , where we 're actually having to ration drugs , " said @entity34 , who calls it " unbelievable			0
" in november 2011 , @entity1 appeared on @entity0 's " @entity44 , @entity45 " to share her ordeal			1
she told dr. @entity44 , @entity0 's chief medical correspondent , that without @entity35 , she had few alternatives			0
" at the time we just said , ' @entity49 with what we have , and see what happens , ' and the cancer pretty rapidly recurred			2
" @entity1 was never able to get another dose of @entity35 and spent the last month of her life in hospice care			1
she was able to make one last trip -- to the @entity57 to attend her daughter 's wedding			0
in a follow - up interview with @entity1 's daughters on this past weekend 's " @entity44 , @entity45 , " daughter @entity62 told @entity44 , " we were n't sure until even ( the ) last minute if she was able to come			1
so we bought her the ticket , hoping it would give her something for her to look forward to , and she did , and it was just wonderful			0
" on june 29 , 2012 , @entity1 died			1
@entity69 's sister , @entity68 , did n't hide her frustration with the situation			0
" you feel like you 're in this time now , it 's 2012			0
you feel like , you 're in @entity3			0
why ca n't she get these drugs , that she needs to treat something so serious ? " critical dependence on a few companies how did it get to this point ? according to @entity34 , " we only have a couple of companies , and the problem is that if one of these companies goes down because of @entity13 inspections , manufacturing problems or something like that , we do n't have those drugs if only one company is making them			1
" the @entity93 came to the same conclusion			1
in a recent report , the panel claimed the @entity13 -- the very agency tasked with dealing with shortages -- is partly to blame for the shortage situation			1
the report paints a scathing picture of a regulatory agency that gave little consideration to the potential outcome of its actions			0
" the committee has learned that @entity13 regulatory activity has effectively shut down 30 % of the total manufacturing capacity at four of @entity3 's largest producers of generic injectable medications , " it said			1
" the @entity13 has failed to ensure that enforcement and compliance activities are conducted in a manner that does not create unnecessary shortages of critical drugs , " according to the @entity93 report			1
that report is disputed by the @entity13			1
" let me just say , very clearly , that the report is incorrect , " dr. @entity119 of the @entity13 said on " @entity44 , @entity45			1
" " we are not in this situation because the @entity13 is shutting down companies			1
@entity13 is part of the solution			1
" @entity119 is the deputy director of the @entity13 's @entity126 , @entity127			1
she said @entity13 inspection processes and enforcement rules have not changed			1
" what has changed is that there is an aging manufacturing infrastructure , and there are serious quality problems that have required companies to close down to fix the problems			0
" on monday , the @entity13 issued a letter to rep. @entity138 ( @entity139 ) of the @entity93 , responding to the committee 's blaming the @entity13 for the shortages			1
the letter reiterated the report was false and emphasized the @entity13 is part of the solution			1
what happened with @entity35 while @entity35 is not a generic drug , it was manufactured by @entity148 , one of the country 's four largest producers of generic injectables			2
the @entity154 lab was the sole manufacturer of @entity35 in the nation			0
it voluntarily shut down in november 2011			0
a may 2011 @entity13 inspection found a string of problems , including inadequate oversight and metallic particle shards in some of the drugs produced on site			2
a november 2011 @entity13 inspection found additional problems , including finding a 10 - gallon can in a storage area that contained urine			2
in a statement sent to @entity0 after it shut down , @entity154 labs said its team " has been working around the clock to implement changes needed to ensure a more sustained supply of the medicines we produce and to address the manufacturing - related issues at our facility noted in recent inspections by the @entity13 and other global regulatory agencies			1
" however , @entity154 maintained that none of the @entity35 supply was affected			0
from their findings , the @entity93 found that 58 % of the drugs on the shortage list were produced at facilities cited by the @entity13			1
they also found that the @entity13 's warning letters increased 156 % from 2010 to 2011			1
dr. @entity188 , former @entity13 deputy commissioner , said the @entity13 is n't concerned about the outcome , though			2
" they go in , they inspect facilities and then they issue findings			0
you 're not asked to worry if there 's a stable supply			0
you 're asked to make sure the facility falls in line			0
" but @entity119 says it 's quite the opposite			0
" well , it 's our job to worry about it in our drug shortages team			1
when we issue warning letters today , we ask companies to very specifically communicate with us how they plan to address the problem , so we can assess what the potential of a shortage is , " she told @entity0			0
@entity119 also cited the recent reauthorization of the @entity213 as a key to preventing shortages			2
signed by president @entity217 earlier this month , the act will help the @entity13 expedite the drug review process , particularly for drugs in shortage			1
it will also require companies to notify the @entity13 if they anticipate an interruption in production			2
" it allows us as a regulatory agency to step in , and try and prevent the shortage in the first place , " @entity119 said			0
" so for example , we can go to other companies to ask them to increase their production			0
we can assist companies that are having difficulties to finding alternatives for the difficulties they are having , and even in rare cases , we can seek sources of medications from other countries , where they might be being produced to our standards			0
" help comes from abroad that 's actually what happened in the case of @entity35			0
in february , the @entity13 stepped in and allowed the importation of @entity249 from an @entity251 manufacturer , a possible therapeutic alternative			2
but @entity34 said he was never able to get his hands on it			0
" the key is having enough notice , " says @entity119			0
since @entity217 signed an executive order requesting early notification from manufacturers in november 2011 , more and more companies have been able to give the @entity13 the needed heads - up			1
" we 've done that successfully innumerable times			0
just since january , at our count , we 've prevented 94 to 100 shortages , things the public never sees , " @entity119 told @entity44			2
" i think it 's a start , " says @entity34 , but it 's not enough			0
" i think these shortages are going to continue because of the same problems that we have			2
there are certainly fixes out there for it			0
i do n't think these shortages are going to go away because of this bill			2
" for @entity1 's daughters , it 's all too late			2
had @entity1 gotten the @entity35 , @entity69 says , " i think she thought it would have at least put her in remission in another time , or it would save her from the chemo that was detrimental to her			2

@entity1 , who had cancer , died after not receiving the drug she needed
the number of drug shortages is up 300 % since 2005 , according to the @entity13
the @entity93 blames the @entity13 for shortages
