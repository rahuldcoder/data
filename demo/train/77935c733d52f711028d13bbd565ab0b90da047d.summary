-- " how much did you weigh when you were born ? " dr. @entity2 asks the first time we talk			1
it 's not a typical , get - to - know - you kind of question , but it seems almost normal coming from @entity2			1
he 's a pediatric neurologist who specializes in perinatal medicine and reproductive health in the @entity9 and developing countries			1
each year , worldwide , nearly 1 million babies die on the day they are born , according to a new report from @entity13			1
giving birth is also risky for mothers ; nearly 800 women die every day during pregnancy or childbirth			1
while we 've made significant strides in reducing child and maternal mortality rates since the 1970s , there are still many lives to save			1
" almost all newborn deaths originate from preventable and treatable causes , " the report authors write			1
" we already have the tools available to save about three - quarters of the newborns who needlessly die each year			2
" @entity2 has worked his entire life to ensure that moms and their babies have the best chance of survival			1
in 1983 , he co-wrote the @entity37 ' first official " @entity36 , " which is still being used by doctors to ensure pregnant women and their infants receive quality care			1
now , as director of the @entity44 in @entity45 at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity2 's primary focus is on preventing low birth weight by improving women 's health care			1
@entity2 recently spoke with @entity0 about his work and the personal loss that inspired his passion			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : why are you so passionate about this issue ? dr. @entity2 : my mother died during my birth in 1934 in @entity61			1
she was 30 when i was born			2
she was born in the 1900s and she went to college -- unusual for ( women at that time )			2
i think if there had been a cesarean section possibility , then my mother would have survived			1
it was unclear whether she had an old rheumatic heart disease that may have affected a valve			2
or ... there was a lot of malaria at the time			2
the possibility might have been that she had malarial heart disease and was really tired out and could n't make labor			2
they had to pull me out			2
my mother died shortly after that			1
@entity0 : what are the most common health issues associated with a low birthweight ? @entity2 : a low - birthweight infant is at greater risk for respiratory distress , bacterial infections , gastrointestinal tract problems and the effects of jaundice			1
in surviving infants weighing less than 3.5 pounds , problems of neurodevelopmental disabilities include cerebral palsy , impaired mental development , blindness and hearing deficits			2
@entity0 : the center at @entity46 has developed what 's called a " systems approach " to reducing maternal and infant deaths			2
why is that important ? @entity2 : we have to treat the triad of the mother , the fetus and the newborn in a very special , continuous way			1
there has to be a systems approach to care			2
( @entity110 ) mortality , you see , we do n't have a vaccine to prevent that			2
it 's not like polio ; it 's not like smallpox			0
from the moment a little girl is born ... all the things that influence her life , all the factors that influence her life , are extremely important			0
we clearly understand that the missing link in all ( maternal and infant deaths ) is the absence of women 's health			0
that 's not pregnant women 's health , you see			0
it 's women 's health			0
it 's critical that we change our whole view , that the woman is more than a vessel for making children			0
her health is very vital			0
@entity0 : what 's the goal of the center ? @entity2 : " the role in those in leadership must be to continuously reevaluate what is unacceptable			1
" that 's ( a quote ) from the doctor that eradicated smallpox			0
i 've sort of moved from ( saving ) the high - risk , critical , intensive - care tiny babies to finally asking myself , " where are all of these babies coming from , and can we have fewer ? " yes , we need continued research on finding out why things happen			1
but there is a moral imperative in implementing what we already know works			1
and the collaborating center has been about that mission			0
@entity0 : what have you 've learned working in developing nations ? @entity2 : we 've probably ... worked in some 30 different countries			1
( we are ) in active projects right now in @entity170 and in @entity171			0
we have been working in @entity172 a number of years			0
our center is working in places like @entity176 , and the @entity178 republics , some in @entity180			0
i 've worked in all those regions			0
the message , i think , there is the fact that if you do not have malaria , then the issues surrounding women 's health and pregnancy outcomes -- whether it 's in the delta of @entity193 , in south @entity194 in @entity47 , @entity195 , in @entity196 , in @entity197 , in @entity198 -- all around the world , the issues of women 's health are the same			0
@entity0 : what do you mean ? @entity2 : women in low - resource settings have difficulty controlling their lives			1
you did n't choose your parents , and ... you did n't choose your color of your skin			0
you did n't choose the country in which you 're born			0
if you think carefully , that probably influences 90 % of our ( health ) outcomes			0
we have maybe 10 % left			0
it 's just great to be involved in helping to improve a system of health care through which we never ask to come			0
we work within ministries of health , and also within universities , so that we can help design systems that influence all of the population			0
@entity0 : what is most crucial for a woman to have a healthy baby ? not too early , not too many , not too soon and not too late			0
the best outcome for a healthy pregnancy is to be wanted , planned and have access to prenatal care with appropriate nutrition and delivered by a skilled attendant ... followed by access to modern contraception for appropriate child spacing .			0
