the killing occurred while the couple was visiting @entity19 's family to celebrate the @entity33 holy month of @entity34			2
@entity36 prosecutor @entity35 said at a news conference shortly after the killing that the fact that @entity42 , a @entity33 , was killed during the holy month of ramadan " made this case especially compelling to us			1
" a release from the prosecutor 's office said that while being treated for his wounds , which were not life - threatening , @entity15 had described the shooters as three men who shouted " slurs about terrorists " at the couple before fleeing on foot			1
but within hours of the crime , investigators believed " it was obvious " the victim 's husband was behind the attack , @entity35 said			2

the indictment also charges the pair with conspiracy and unlawful possession of a weapon in addition to child endangerment and child abuse because the 3 - year - old had been in jeopardy			0
" this case was extensively investigated with witnesses interviewed and significant evidence gathered in numerous states			0
we now look forward to presenting our proofs in court and again extend our sympathies to @entity42 's family for such a tragic and senseless loss , " @entity35 said thursday			0
