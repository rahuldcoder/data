-- an analysis carried out by a language monitoring service said friday that gov. @entity3 spoke at a more than ninth - grade level and sen. @entity5 spoke at a nearly eighth - grade level in thursday night 's debate between the vice presidential candidates			1
the analysis by the @entity12 , @entity11 - based @entity10 said @entity3 , governor of @entity13 and the @entity15 vice presidential nominee , used the passive voice in 8 percent of her sentences , far more than the 5 percent used by the @entity19 senator from @entity20			2
the analysis noted that the " passive voice can be used to deflect responsibility ; @entity5 used active voice when referring to [ vice president @entity24 ] @entity25 and [ president ] @entity26 ; @entity3 countered with passive deflections			1
" " it obscures the doer of the action , " said @entity10 president @entity28 , an independent with no political affiliation			0
the two candidates were nearly even in total number of words spoken			0
the normally voluble @entity5 restrained his tendency to ramble by uttering just 5,492 words during the 90 - minute debate , versus 5,235 for @entity3 , @entity28 said			1
in last week 's debate between sen. @entity39 and sen. @entity41 , @entity39 spoke 8,068 words during the 90 - minute event , while @entity41 spoke 7,150 , @entity28 said			0
thursday night 's debate between the vice presidential candidates " was more collegial , thinking out loud as opposed to just hammering points , " @entity28 said in trying to explain the difference			0
" it was a much calmer style			0
" his analysis ranked the candidates ' speech on several other levels , too			0
here 's the breakdown : grade level : @entity5 , 7.8 ; @entity3 , 9.5 ( newspapers are typically written to a sixth - grade reading level			1
) sentences per paragraph : statistically tied at 2.7 for @entity5 and 2.6 for @entity3			1
letters per word : tied at 4.4			2
ease of reading : @entity5 , 66.7 ( with 100 being the easiest to read or hear ) , versus 62.4 for @entity3			2
the analysis said @entity62 spoke at an 11th - grade level during his seven debates in 1858 against incumbent @entity65 in their race for a @entity68 seat from @entity69			1
but higher grade level does n't necessarily mean better sentence , @entity28 said			1
he pointed to @entity3 's second - to - last sentence in the debate , which the formula put at a grade level of 18.3 : " what i would do , also , if that were ever to happen , though , is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on @entity85 and in @entity86 , " @entity3 said			1
" when she said it , it sounded good , but on paper it 's a completely different animal , " @entity28 said			0
" it 's like , what is that ? " but @entity5 had his own challenging moments , such as this 32 - word gem , rated grade 15.6 : " the middle class under @entity41 's tax proposal , 100 million families , middle - class families , households to be precise , they got not a single change ; they got not a single break in taxes			2
" @entity28 praised the usually longer - winded @entity5 for showing restraint here			0
" in a typical @entity5 thing , this sentence would serve as a launching point to even more complex and convoluted statements			2
last night , he was particularly reserved , and you only had to be a college graduate to decipher it , according to the readability statistics			0
