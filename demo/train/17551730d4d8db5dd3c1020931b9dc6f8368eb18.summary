-- the less - than - confrontational comments coming from new @entity3 president @entity2 are not what the @entity4 is used to hearing from that country 's office in recent years			1
@entity2 , a cleric and moderate politician elected in june , has signaled his desire for better engagement with the @entity4 , most recently in a thursday @entity13 op - ed , in which he called for an end to " the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart			2
" coming a week before he 's to attend the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity2 's op - ed called for nations to work together on contentious issues such as @entity3 's nuclear program			1
and he offered to broker efforts to bring peace to @entity27 , a long - time @entity3 ally torn by civil war			2
given @entity3 's closeness to @entity27 's government , it seems unlikely rebels would consider @entity2 an independent broker			1
but @entity2 's tone is far less fiery than that of his predecessor , @entity37			2
and @entity2 's promise of more positive engagement with the world during his election campaign appeared to propel him to victory			2
@entity2 , 65 , enjoyed reformist backing and took more than 50 % of the vote			0
three of the six candidates were much more conservative , and the @entity3 public viewed @entity2 as a mild alternative			2
but how just how conciliatory is @entity2 ? @entity2 is @entity3 's next president hawk or dove ? @entity2 has a reputation for avoiding extreme positions and bridging differences , but he is no pushover			1
he has a long history of service in the country 's defense establishment			1
he is a former commander of the @entity3 air defenses , is a leader on three war and defense councils , and was national security adviser to the president for 13 years before @entity37 took office			2
@entity2 is also a diplomatic and legal intellectual			0
he has three law degrees , including a doctorate from a university in @entity70 , and as president of @entity3 's strategic research center , he regularly publishes essays			1
he has served as managing editor for three quarterlies on scientific and strategic research , and foreign policy			0
he was also @entity3 's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 during the presidency of @entity80 , who later became one of the leading figures in @entity3 's rebellious " @entity83 , " which erupted into street protests after the re-election of @entity37 in 2009			1
@entity37 's government violently quashed the protests with the help of elements of a unit of the @entity91 , which answers to ayatollah @entity92 , @entity3 's supreme leader			1
@entity2 has expressed support for the @entity83			1
" these were protests that were natural and popular , " he has said			0
" they should have been addressed			0
" after @entity99 supporters chanted for him at a rally , security forces arrested members of his campaign			0
relationship with @entity92 @entity2 's relationship with @entity92 has the potential to be complex			2
he represented the supreme leader on @entity3 's security council for many years			1
but @entity2 has purportedly also suggested @entity92 is too rigid toward the international community , said @entity109 , who runs a research program on @entity3 at @entity111			2
in a book about his experience as @entity3 's nuclear negotiator during @entity80 's presidency , @entity2 criticizes @entity92 , according to @entity109			1
" if you read in between the lines , he places a lot of blame on @entity92 , " @entity109 says			0
" he says in his book that if it was up to him , he and his team would have come up with a solution that would not lead up to @entity3 's case being deferred to the @entity19 -- saying ' we could have done this , and some people in @entity3 and some in the @entity4 torpedoed it			1
" a televised presidential debate turned into an animated political clash and touched on @entity3 's nuclear program			1
exchanges grew so heated that the candidates were later accused of having revealed national secrets during the debate			0
@entity2 was warned that he could be barred from running in the elections because of confidential material he revealed about @entity3 's nuclear program during the two - hour - long debate			1
it was n't his first testy moment with @entity3 's state - run media			1
he has openly accused it of censorship and publishing lies			0
many believe @entity2 was not @entity92 's favorite candidate			0
but @entity92 has said he is not playing favorites and would not let on whom he voted for			0
and @entity92 and his @entity149 had to approve all candidates before the race began			0
out of 680 who applied to run , only eight were allowed to do so			0
ultimately , the supreme leader approved @entity2 's candidacy after rejecting the candidacy of a former president , @entity157			0
@entity157 endorsed @entity2 during his campaign			0
@entity2 is a senior cleric and still is a member of the assembly of experts , which is responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader			1
as @entity92 ages and the appointment of a successor becomes necessary , @entity2 will likely have influence on the choice			0
@entity0 's @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 contributed to this report			0
