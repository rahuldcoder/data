@entity0 -- bomb squads in @entity3 successfully defused on sunday two bombs and disposed of an additional air - dropped military device that had caused an evacuation of historic proportions in a city in the country 's west			1
the 45,000 evacuated residents of the city of @entity13 , situated on the @entity14 and @entity15 , were allowed to return home			1
workers rendered inert the two bombs , one 4,000 - pound " air mine " and a smaller high - density explosive bomb			2
then they destroyed a third non-explosive device by way of a controlled detonation , according to the @entity13 fire department			2
the fire brigade had pre-warned the population about the controlled detonation to allay possible fears that one of the powerful bombs may have exploded			2
life had come to a standstill in the western @entity3 city of @entity13 , where 45,000 people -- nearly half of the @entity36 ´ s population -- had been evacuated after the discovery of several dangerous @entity39 bombs			1
" it 's the largest @entity3 evacuation since the end of the war , " fire brigade spokesman @entity40 said sunday			1
for 65 years , the @entity14 hid two bombs and an fog - producing device that were dropped by @entity47 and @entity48 warplanes in the last years of the war			1
when water levels dropped to record lows last week , the bombs were finally found			0
the function of the fog - producing device was to block the vision of anti-aircraft personnel on the ground during @entity39 to make it harder for them to fire upon the allied planes carrying out the bombing mission			1
" while time passed by , and @entity13 was rebuild ( ing ) , the bombs got even more dangerous , " bomb - disposal squad member @entity61 said sunday			2
the largest of the explosives is a 1.8 metric ton @entity48 air bomb that has the potential to destroy the @entity70 s center , according to the fire brigade			1
but the focus of attention was n't on the largest bomb -- it was on the much smaller , 125 - kilogram ( 275 - pound ) @entity47 high - explosive bomb			2
it was " transformed on impact of the earth " making it more difficult to deactivate the detonator , @entity61 said			0
last week , hundreds of volunteers started evacuating two hospitals and seven homes for senior citizens			0
a prison and numerous hotels are also affected by the shutdown			0
by mid-sunday morning , authorities declared the center of @entity13 a " forbidden area			0
" about 1,000 authorities were searching the town to make sure any left behind leave			0
the fire brigade built a wall of more than 2,500 sandbags since the bombs were found in the river			2
water pumps draining part of the river help ensure the two four - men teams can defuse the bombs precisely			1
@entity40 said he is optimistic the operation will be successful			0
" people in @entity13 are used to bomb findings , " he said			0
despite the inconvenience for those evacuated , the situation could have been much worse			0
" if we had found an even larger bomb , we would have been forced to evacuate all 100,000 citizens of @entity13 , " @entity40 said			0
the deactivation of bombs is a common practice in @entity3			1
last year , a bomb exploded in the @entity3 town @entity118 -- killing three members of a bomb - disposal squad			1
during @entity39 , an estimated 257 @entity48 air bombs were dropped on @entity13 alone , according to the local fire brigade			1
it is not known how many of them did not explode and have been forgotten			0
bomb - disposal squads have only managed to deactivate three of them until now .			0
