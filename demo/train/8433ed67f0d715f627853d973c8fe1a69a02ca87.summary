-- hundreds of people aboard two cruise ships in the @entity3 fell ill due to norovirus , the latest instances in which the stomach bug has thwarted vacationers at sea			1
the @entity10 reported friday that norovirus had hit more than 600 passengers and crew on @entity15 's @entity14 , making it one of the biggest such outbreaks on any cruise ship in the last two decades			1
the vessel returned to port wednesday , two days earlier than expected , and four days after the @entity10 began its investigation			1
" no particular source has been identified , and it 's quite possible a source wo n't be identified , " the agency said			0
in addition , the @entity24 , operated by @entity25 , cut short its own seven - day @entity3 itinerary on friday			1
@entity25 said that 178 passengers and 11 crew members aboard had been stricken with norovirus , with @entity10 staffers on board friday to help sanitize that ship			1
the cruise line 's official reason for ending the trip early was not the norovirus outbreak , but rather a forecast of dense fog this weekend at the @entity41 port that was its final call			1
the report did n't sit well with some passengers , who spoke to @entity0 affiliate @entity45 as they disembarked the ship friday			1
princess spokeswoman @entity47 insisted that the prospect of fog making ship channels into the @entity41 port unnavigable was the only factor in turning the boat around			1
@entity53 of @entity54 questioned the fog story			2
" that 's last tuesday they tell us this , and they 've never said anything different , " he told @entity45			1
" i knew then nobody can predict five days in advance			0
i knew that that was n't the case			0
they were just doing that to minimize their damages			0
" what is norovirus ? @entity70 and @entity71 of @entity72 , 50 miles south of @entity41 , said they had a great time but were disappointed to turn back before the ship reached @entity76			1
" i 'm still looking for the fog , " @entity77 told the station			2
" it 's a little irritating			0
" @entity71 added , " we were looking forward to ( going to @entity76 )			0
that 's why we had taken the cruise , yes , but things happen			2
" @entity86 spokesman @entity85 said @entity24 was informed tuesday that there was " a high probability of a fog event " this weekend			0
@entity91 , which bills itself as a " full - time weather department for hundreds of companies around the globe , " sent @entity24 a report wednesday predicting dense fog setting in late friday afternoon , @entity90 said			1
" breaks in the fog are not likely until the cold front moves offshore late sunday morning or early sunday afternoon			0
thus , we are expecting that the ship channel will be closed for parts of friday , all day saturday , and sunday through the afternoon hours , " the report said			0
@entity24 , concerned the boat " could n't navigate the channel to get back to port , " then made the decision to turn the boat around , @entity90 said			0
asked if the ship would have continued on to @entity76 if the forecast had called for clear skies in @entity41 on friday , she that was " 100 % correct			1
" are cruise ships floating petri dishes ? the @entity24 departed january 25 on its western @entity3 tour with planned stops in @entity116 , @entity117 , the @entity118 island of @entity119 and @entity76 , but threats of fog forced the ship to return home before it made it to @entity76 , @entity24 said in its statement			1
the cruise ship was carrying 3,104 passenger and 1,149 crew members			1
" we truly regret having to make this change to our passengers ' vacations , and we hope they understand that we did not have any choice but to return to @entity41 early before the unusually heavy fog closes the port , " it said			1
@entity24 will provide hotels for those flying out of @entity41 , and passengers " will receive a future cruise credit of 20 % of their fare as well as one day per diem " for meals and other expenses , the statement said			1
" approximately five passengers " still had norovirus symptoms friday , the cruise line said , describing it as " a common but contagious illness which is widely circulating throughout @entity153			1
" the gastrointestinal illness causes vomiting and diarrhea , the @entity10 says			2
sick passengers were asked to stay in their cabins while staff disinfected public areas such as restrooms and elevators			0
several passengers told @entity45 that crew members wearing gloves distributed hand sanitizer throughout the ship , and passengers were n't allowed to touch items like salt shakers , tongs and forks in the ship 's common areas			1
royal @entity3 cruise ship returns home - with a sickness record @entity179 of @entity41 said he came down with an illness , but the symptoms passed after two days			1
still , he said , the staff made him feel as if he were being incarcerated			2
" i was tired of being held as a prisoner in the room , " he said			0
" they did n't bring food			0
they said they were bringing food			0
we had to call and remind them every time			0
" his cabin mate , @entity197 said , " i would have to leave the room and go get him food			0
" he added that the staff worked diligently to keep the outbreak from spreading			0
" they were trying really hard , but they were also very rude about it , " @entity197 told @entity45			2
@entity179 said the 20 % credit on a future cruise amounted to " nothing " when you consider he was n't allowed to dine in the onboard restaurants and never saw @entity76			0
despite more than one of every 20 passengers being ill , many passengers reported seeing no sick people during the trip			2
@entity213 and @entity214 of @entity215 , @entity216 , saw a passenger vomiting on the beach during one of the cruise 's stops			2
" they immediately removed her , cleaned the area , bleached the sand , everything			0
it was handled well , " @entity227 told @entity45			2
@entity0 's @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
