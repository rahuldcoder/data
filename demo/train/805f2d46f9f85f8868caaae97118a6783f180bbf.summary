@entity0 -- president @entity2 is running against former @entity4 gov. @entity3 , but the economy may truly be his greatest opponent			1
" it 's not the only factor , but it 's arguably the most important factor , " said @entity8 associate professor @entity7 , who has created a computer model to analyze the impact of the economy on the presidential campaign			1
" the forecasting model suggests a very close race with maybe a slight edge to @entity2 , but not necessarily a large edge -- nothing he can be very confident in , " @entity7 said			1
@entity2 faces a perfect storm that threatens to sink his prospects of a second term			2
the price of gas is dropping but is still high			0
the stock market remains volatile , unemployment ticked up again , and the eurozone crisis lingers			0
in a brief statement friday after which he also took a few questions , @entity2 described the depth of the nation 's troubled economic recovery			1
" the hole we have to fill is much deeper , and the global aftershocks are much greater , " he said			0
@entity7 has crunched the numbers , using the president 's approval ratings , economic conditions and consumer confidence			1
he compares those factors to past presidential races			0
what his models show him is that the president is facing similar conditions to what former president @entity51 faced when he lost to @entity53 in 1980 , with one exception : @entity51 was less popular than @entity2 among his own party			1
" the president can count on a reservoir of support in his own party that previous @entity61 presidents may not have been able to count on , " @entity56 said			2
the gloomy news adds to the national frustration and could weigh on some voters			0
" the best thing the president can hope for is not just a good economy but good economic headlines , " @entity7 said			2
according to a @entity1 / @entity71 poll , most @entity69 have doubts about which of the two presidential candidates can fix the problem			0
but a slight majority , 50 % to 44 % , says @entity3 has the right kind of business experience for the task , despite attacks by the @entity2 campaign on the former @entity4 governor 's record at private equity firm @entity83			1
the poll 's margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points			0
@entity3 uses the slow recovery to cast the president as a failure who is in over his head and frequently defaults to the blame game			0
" the president 's message in all this -- have you heard his campaign slogan ? forward ! forward ! forward over a cliff , " @entity3 joked with supporters at a campaign event in @entity103 , @entity104			2
" he is looking around ; he is trying to find someone to blame			0
" to help lift the economy and his campaign too , @entity2 is putting pressure on @entity110 to pass items on his " to - do " list , even though @entity113 are n't likely to act anytime soon .			1
