@entity1 , whose exploits led to his being dubbed " @entity1 , " is the first freshman to win the @entity4 , college football 's most prestigious award			1
" this is a moment i 've dreamed about since i 've been a kid , running around the backyard pretending to be @entity9 , pretending i was throwing @entity14 to my dad , " @entity1 said , gesturing to @entity9 , the former @entity10 quarterback who was onstage with other previous @entity4 winners			2
" it 's such an honor to represent @entity2 and my teammates here tonight , " he told the audience at the @entity17 in @entity18			0

but beyond the numbers , what put @entity1 on the map was his play in @entity2 's improbable november win against @entity40 , ranked @entity41 in the nation at the time			1
the @entity44 were thought not to have much chance of success in the first season in the @entity33 , but largely because of @entity1 's play , they finished the regular season 10 - 2 and will be playing @entity50 in the @entity51 on january 4			2
