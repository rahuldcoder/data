-- the first anniversary of the @entity3 revolution is today			1
@entity3 society and the forces in @entity3 are in a state of anticipation			0
world media has its cameras and correspondents in @entity10 and major cities around the country			0
but many @entity3 wonder if the revolution amounted to nothing more than a military coup			1
it has been a year since the eruption of the first @entity3 revolution that stunned the world and ended 30 years of authoritarian , oppressive and corrupt rule by @entity21 , @entity3 's last pharaoh			1
@entity21 ended up in jail along with his sons and his regime 's major figures , with stories of their unimaginable corruption , brutality and looting surfacing ever since			1
but since then , most @entity3 have become angry and frustrated with the performance of the @entity33 -- comprising more than a dozen elderly generals -- that has taken control			2
@entity3 , political forces and revolutionaries accuse the @entity33 of being accomplices with the remnants of the @entity21 regime and of refusing to enact real reform , to the point of actually waging a counter-revolution			1
@entity3 have been enraged by the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations that followed the revolution , and in the arrests , humiliations and even killings of protesters			1
the @entity33 is still controlling the state media and the political scene			0
@entity55 governments and human rights organizations are expressing their dismay , with @entity59 reporting killings and brutal attacks , some of them sexual , on protesters			0
the council is the @entity64 , desperately trying to preserve the military 's long - standing privileges and special status			2
the military has been running @entity3 since 1952 -- with rulers such as gen. @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity21 and @entity73 coming from its ranks			1
the military has dominated @entity3 's modern political scene , with members serving as presidents , prime ministers , cabinet ministers , governors , party elites , heads of the security services , ambassadors , heads of many companies , and even ministers of culture and the media -- in a true orwellian fashion			2
the military institution in @entity3 consumes more than 25 % of the government expenditure and owns about 30 % of the national economy			2
the @entity94 has given @entity3 a hefty military aid package of billions of dollars for nearly three decades			2
@entity3 respect their armed forces , but are desperate for a civil state where human rights , rights of minorities , and accountability and transparency are guaranteed			0
they do not want another pharaoh - like president coming from that institution			0
@entity3 have been asked to commemorate the special occasion of the revolution 's first anniversary by taking to the streets wednesday , wearing black in mourning of the deaths of hundreds of the revolution 's martyrs			1
but some political forces refuse to call it a celebration -- they say the revolution is not finished and their demands have not been met			0
demonstrators have already started to pour into @entity121			0
activists are calling for the immediate transition of power from the @entity33 to a civilian council , or even an interim caretaker			1
now , after bringing down the @entity21 regime and his notorious state security apparatus , @entity3 have broken the fear barrier and believe there is no turning back			1
will they stun the world again , with @entity133 , @entity134 ? follow @entity135 on @entity136			0
