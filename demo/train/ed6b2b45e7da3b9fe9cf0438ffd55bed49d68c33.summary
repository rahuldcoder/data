@entity1 , @entity2 -- " we are the 99 percent			1
" this is the one belief all protesters in @entity7 's @entity6 have in common , according to @entity8			0
although they claim to be using @entity12 tactics , they are actually continuing a practice that emerged in @entity14 and the @entity15 near the end of the 18th century , quickly spread to other countries and is now a truly transnational phenomenon			1
for centuries , the street had been the stage for the 1 % of society instead			1
members of the civic , religious and military elite used public spaces to present themselves and underline their claim of authority and status in elaborate and carefully choreographed processions			2
nowadays , the street has primarily become the forum for those who feel excluded from the halls of power , or not properly represented by the existing political institutions			0
@entity42 street protest has acquired a degree of political legitimacy that is astonishing , considering that well into the 20th century , the sight of ordinary people acting collectively in public on behalf of their own interest was widely regarded as a prelude to social unrest or even revolution			1
the @entity49 writer @entity48 gave this widely held view pseudo-scientific credibility in his 1895 book " @entity52 , " which described the latter as a dangerous and primitive entity which was highly susceptible to manipulation by demagogues			0
the perception of collective street protest as a public order problem persisted well into the 20th century and only started to change with the arrival of the middle - class based " @entity61 " after the @entity63			1
until then , even democratic governments frequently felt at license to act with overwhelming force and sometimes great brutality against protesters			0
the @entity69 skillfully exploited this to its advantage in the 1960s , and new doctrines of restrained policing were developed in several countries to deny protesters the status of martyrs			2
police crackdowns on orderly protests became rare , although the @entity82 meeting in @entity83 in 1999 marked a shift back to a stronger emphasis on public order , at least in the @entity15			1
the events around the blockade of @entity89 on october 1st show the dangers of this approach			0
although the police framed their actions as a measure to keep the traffic flowing -- an argument that authorities around the world have used since the late 19th century to regulate protest marches -- and did not arrest those who walked on the sidewalks , the detention of more than 700 people appeared heavy - handed			1
the incident , together with a police officer using pepper spray against female protesters , turned the largely ignored campaign into a media story			1
gaining exposure and media coverage is an important aim of all street protest			1
it not only provides opportunities to present political demands but also to showcase the movement behind the protest			1
already the @entity119 , whose 19th century demonstrations provided the template for all subsequent demonstrations , used them to present the public with an image of the working class in action			1
the choreography of the march with its orderly columns , the way the marchers dressed and the banners they carried with them represented the @entity119 's intention as well as ability to create an alternative order of society			0
the route of the column usually led them through the territory of their opponents or to the centers of political power , thereby laying claim to both of them			0
subsequent movements such as the suffragettes or the unemployed often followed the same pattern			0
the protesters in @entity7 continue this tradition			2
by having a leaderless structure and holding general assemblies every day , they further underline their opposition to the hierarchical undemocratic world of @entity159 and publicly perform the alternative model of society they are propagating			0
occupying @entity6 and referring to it by its former name , @entity6 , makes the same point			0
at least as important as the chance to gain access to the media is the effect such protests have on supporters and sympathizers			2
collective action and confrontations with the police foster the internal cohesion of movements			2
small successes , such as circumventing the ban on megaphones by collectively repeating the words of each public speaker , provide a sense of empowerment and create a positive public image			2
support from celebrities or academics such as @entity187 give further encouragement			0
taken together , such successes can have a mobilizing effect as the start of demonstrations and occupations in other @entity15 cities shows			0
in the light of the relatively small number of people involved and the apparent scarcity of resources the movement controls , these are considerable achievements			2
unlike the protest in @entity204 in @entity205 , the protest in @entity7 will not start a revolution			0
but it has started a public debate and forced the media in the @entity15 and abroad to report on the event			1
because of that , whether the protesters will eventually be able to occupy @entity159 is of no real significance			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			1

@entity216 : @entity218 say they are the 99 % , as opposed to the *wealthy*
@entity216 : protest is part of tradition started in 18th century to take streets away from elites
@entity228 police tactics *softened* as @entity229 made martyrs of *victims* , he says
@entity216 says movement has spread , started a public debate and forced media to report on it
