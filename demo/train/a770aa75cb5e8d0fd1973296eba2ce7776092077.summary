@entity0 -- every so often , grassroots activism succeeds in @entity3			1
we saw one this week			0
caving in to public pressure , government officials in the southwestern city of @entity7 in @entity8 abandoned plans to build a billion - dollar chemical plant			1
@entity12 abandoned amid protests this came just days after thousands of angry residents took to the streets in protest at the city 's bid to build the $ 1.6 billion @entity21 plant			1
city officials said it had passed all environmental evaluations , but local residents , worried about long - term pollution and health hazards , said " no. " defying government and police orders , they marched to the chant of " @entity32 's environment , return our beautiful home ! " soon enough , the mayor conceded and promised to suspend construction			1
then on friday , the city 's @entity37 chief was sacked			2
" the people have achieved their goals if their protest was just a @entity43 ( not in my backyard ) movement , " the @entity39 noted rather acerbically			0
but some political observers see beyond parochial backyards			2
" it is a stunning case of a local @entity43 movement coalescing with the support of nationwide public opinion through the internet , " said @entity49 , a @entity50 - based expert on the @entity3 internet			1
" the new media , particularly through ( @entity59 - like ) @entity58 and popular forums such as @entity61 played an absolutely critical role in the whole process			0
" @entity49 said netizens spread the news instantly and widely , exposed police violence against protesters and generated popular outrage			2
" with such national exposure and public opinion on the protesters ' side , the local authorities had no choice but to cave in instantly , " he said			2
a few other @entity43 protesters have succeeded in @entity3			1
in 2009 , local residents rallied and aborted a government plan to build a waste incinerator plant in a suburban town in southern @entity81			1
that same year , @entity83 residents foiled a city plan to construct a high - speed train line using magnetic levitation technology complete with a raised concrete track			1
last august , thousands of protesters forced officials in the northeastern port city of @entity91 to shut down and promise to relocate a controversial chemical plant that produced paraxylene ( @entity94 ) , which residents feared was carcinogenic			1
political observers attribute these successes to smart tactics			2
" the environment is a perfect issue for the public to exploit the central - local divide , " said @entity99 , a political science professor at the @entity100 in the @entity50 " people know when to claim their right to resist the local government by using central government regulations , " @entity99 explained			1
" @entity0 is often sympathetic to such public demand since it does not hurt its own legitimacy			0
scholars describe this tactic as the ' rightful resistance			0
' " this is best exemplified by one of the @entity32 protesters ' banners : " long live the @entity37 , kick out the copper factory ! " but @entity3 has been grappling with a spike in social unrest			1
@entity121 has been rising over land seizures , a growing wealth divide , official corruption and environmental pollution			0
rural unrest is also a problem , though nothing new			0
in the early 1990s , i covered a farmers ' protest in @entity8 over unpopular taxation policies			0
but what is new is the increased scope and frequency of the protests			2
they have now spread to towns and cities			0
another new factor is the @entity58 phenomenon			0
the hugely popular micro-blogging service now has more than 300 million subscribers who post about 100 million tweets every day			0
despite government censorship , @entity58 is tearing down walls that block the free flow of information			2
government censors can not completely stop @entity58 users from downloading and forwarding news and views via @entity58			0
when @entity152 , a blind activist , escaped house arrest and took refuge at the @entity155 in @entity0 , sustained public attention on @entity58 helped put pressure on @entity3 and @entity50 officials to seek a diplomatic solution			1
" the spotlight makes a huge difference , " said @entity160 , a professor at the @entity161 in @entity162			0
" the @entity152 case was dealt with in reaction of media attention			0
" @entity152 on his next move @entity152 has since been allowed to leave and study in the @entity50 when these unsavory events break , most official @entity3 media are usually tight - lipped , or are careful to provide information following the official lines			1
" it is worth pointing out that while the official media kept its usual silence during the entire time , there was very little online censorship applied on this event , at least in the first couple of days , " said @entity49			0
@entity49 thinks the censors ' apparent inaction could be because pictures and protest messages spread too fast for the censors to control ; or it could be a deliberate decision by censors in @entity0 because it involves a local environmental issue			1
the @entity100 's @entity99 says it is not uncommon nowadays for local governments to give in to demands on issues like the environment and labor rights -- but not on core issues			0
" i doubt if the local government would compromise so easily had it been a protest for ethnic autonomy in @entity198 , " he said			1
is official tolerance and compromise now the new normal ? not necessarily , observers agree			0
" if the central authorities are determined to suppress the information and opposition voices , they can still contain the scale of public awareness , " said @entity49 , founder of @entity202 , a @entity50 - based bilingual website on @entity3			1
" collective demonstrations will occur over and over but the authorities will still seek to deal with them oppressively where they can , " added @entity160 , author of " @entity3 's @entity209 , " which looks at @entity3 's @entity210			2
but @entity49 says local officials can learn a lesson or two from this week 's @entity7 episode			1
" they should learn that when facing massive demonstrations , using brutal force can have the opposite result than intended , especially in the internet age , since there is risk that violence will be exposed quickly in front of the whole nation			0
