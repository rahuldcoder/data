-- the day after the deadly bombings at the @entity5 's finish line , the city 's police commissioner said that spot was probably one of the most photographed in the country in the minutes before it became a crime scene			1
but it 's no @entity11			2
while the targeted stretch of @entity15 's @entity14 is often lively and always in focus on @entity17 , @entity12 's @entity11 is a hub of activity -- including locals and tourists , vendors and performers , not to mention police officers -- most every hour of every day			1
its status as one of @entity28 's busiest , brightest , most bustling places also makes it a target			2
that was true in 2010 , when @entity32 @entity31 pleaded guilty to plotting to blow up a car bomb there			0
@entity11 bomb plotter sentenced to life in prison and it was the case again this month			2
@entity12 mayor @entity39 told reporters thursday that the surviving suspect in last week 's marathon blasts that killed three and wounded scores more told investigators that he and his brother were heading to @entity12 next			1
from the @entity15 hospital bed where he 's being guarded by federal authorities , @entity47 said he and his brother @entity50 , 26 , " decided spontaneously " to target @entity11 , @entity12 police commissioner @entity51 said , citing information he received from the @entity53			1
their plan was to detonate five pipe bombs and a pressure - cooker bomb similar to the ones used days earlier in @entity15 , @entity51 added			2
but the two brothers never made it out of @entity61			0
they carjacked a @entity62 , then stopped at a gas station , @entity51 explained			0
the car 's driver was able then to escape and call police , leading to a chase and shootout , after which @entity69 was declared dead			0
@entity47 , 19 , was captured friday			0
" we do n't know that we would have been able to stop the terrorists , had they arrived here from @entity15 , " @entity39 said			2
" we 're just thankful we did n't have to find out			0
" hub of ' the city that never sleeps ' with billboards and neon lights rivaled in @entity28 perhaps only by those on the @entity78 , @entity11 is hard to miss. the hectic stretch a stone 's throw from @entity83 theaters is flush with stores , hotels and other attractions , from a massive @entity90 with a @entity91 inside to the tower that every @entity88 holds the iconic giant crystal ball			1
for all these reasons and more , it 's frequented by residents passing through and visitors stopping by , one of whom was none other than @entity47			0
@entity51 , the city 's police commissioner , said the surviving @entity15 attack suspect went to @entity12 twice last year			1
on one of those trips , in april , @entity47 was photographed in @entity11			0
authorities do n't know if those visits had anything to do with the @entity47 brothers ' alleged plans to attack @entity12 , nor do they have an indication that the city is " a target of another terrorist attack stemming from the @entity15 bombings , " @entity51 said			1
still , the @entity12 officials acknowledged that had the @entity15 suspects made it to @entity12 , they could have caused untold death and destruction			1
that would be true even if the brothers had gone straight to @entity12 from @entity61 and blown up their bombs right after they got there around 2 or 3 a.m. friday , as estimated by @entity51			0
that 's because @entity11 -- which lies at the intersection of several major thoroughfares with many entertainment venues , clubs and restaurants -- seals @entity12 's reputation as " the city that never sleeps			1
" mayor : ' there are no guarantees ' and in @entity12 , the city 's police commissioner stressed , police are always on alert as well			1
police officers are visible at all hours in @entity11 , said @entity51			2
and they are n't the only ones watching			0
a host of cameras that surround this area and others in @entity12 serve as law enforcement tools			0
some of them capture 360 - degree images ; others shoot from above			0
there 's also ground - level surveillance footage like that credited with initially pinpointing the @entity15 suspects , not to mention whatever can be gleaned from photographs taken by the throngs of tourists that come to the city every day			1
these " extensive networks of cameras " and the " enormous police presence " are there to catch would - be terrorists who might plant a bomb or otherwise inflict violence , @entity39 said			1
the high cost of maintaining such a hefty security presence is worth it , because -- as @entity47 's remarks to the @entity53 showed -- " @entity12 remains a prime target for those who hate @entity28 and want to kill @entity28 , " said the mayor			1
but all the technology , all the intelligence sharing , all the police boots on the ground wo n't eliminate the threat to @entity12 , leaders in that city stressed			2
nor will they necessarily catch the next person or people who want to stage an attack in @entity11			0
as @entity39 said , " there are no guarantees			0

a @entity15 bombings suspect said he was heading to @entity12 , officials say
he told investigators he and his brother planned to bomb @entity11 , they add
@entity12 is a " prime target " for terrorists , the city 's mayor says
there 's a *big* police presence and camera network but " no guarantees , " he adds
