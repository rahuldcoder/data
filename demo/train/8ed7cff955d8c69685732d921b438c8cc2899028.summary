-- on monday , we paid homage to our fallen troops with bratwursts and kielbasa , and that means it 's officially the season of picnics , boat shoes and strolls along the boardwalk , hand in hand			2
as couples pop up out of the woodwork , we deemed it a good time to remind you that as a duo , your doings -- both digital and @entity19 -- will come under particular scrutiny			2
in other words : you 've got the potential to tick a lot of ( probably jealous ) people off			2
a study that came out this february noted that couples tend to have similar facebooking habits ( intense and burning love for the sweet coding of @entity31 , time spent on the site , etc. ) the researchers hypothesize that we simply fall for people with similar interests , but it makes sense to us that this is more effect than cause -- couples might start to follow their partner 's lead , e.g. , amping up their time on the site if their partner 's an avid poster			1
so if either you or your beau is doing something annoying on @entity48 , @entity49 , and the like , you 're probably both guilty of it			1
we 're happy for you , really , we are			0
but in the meantime , we call for a cease and desist of the following obnoxious tics : the couple - y crime : gushing nonstop the online equivalent of : out - of - control pda -- e.g. , making out in line for a row of port - a - potties , surrounded by hapless spectators who soon may need that toilet to vomit an arty @entity64 snap of your girlfriend making @entity68 toast for breakfast : cute			0
a second image 45 minutes later of her whipping up fritters for your fancy weekend picnic , with a caption that concludes , " i have the best gf in the entire world ! ! ! " ? at a certain point , you 're bragging , and those tasty beignets are being baked not just for the enjoyment of you but for the wistful salivation of everyone in your network			0
a good litmus test : if a single friend called and asked how you 're doing , would you pass along the same number of sappy anecdotes and boundless approbation ? if the answer 's no , scale it back			0
the couple - y crime : sharing a profile pic the online equivalent of : adopting his taste in music , movies and political opinions ; forgoing first - person to constantly utilize the royal we ( " we really love @entity103 , " " we thought the wine was a little tannin - y , " " we have slightly elevated blood pressure but it 's only because we get nervous in doctors ' offices			1
" ) this is a contentious topic , and indeed , there 's nothing horrific about opening yourself up to your sig other 's interests in b movies and chillwave tunes			0
but we 're of the opinion that your @entity48 profile is just that : yours , and showing two little faces to every person who searches for you ( or glances at your @entity49 or clicks on your blog or looks you up on @entity127 -- avatars be er'ywhere ) is just a little ... strange			1
( interestingly , the same 2012 study found that among their subjects -- white , 20 - ish - year - old college couples -- the relationships were strongest in pairs where the chick had a fb profile pic of the two of them			1
but that 's probably because a coed in a peachy relationship is likeliest to show her bf off the world			0
) if you must , use a cute , atmospheric photo of the two of you as your cover photo and pick a profile shot that shows your mug alone			1
notable exception : if you have a pic that shows @entity151 in between you two because you spotted him on the @entity152 and stopped him even though he was obviously wearing a hat and trying to blend in -- by all means , make it your profile photo			2
just take it down when the shock value has worn off .			0

keep the goo to a *minimum* , and do *n't* use a shot of the two of you as your profile pic
