-- let me put my cards on the table			0
i was one of those kids who wasted their youth watching " @entity12 " smackdowns between godzilla and his arsenal of enemy combatants such as @entity10 and @entity11			0
there was something about seeing these behemoths stomp @entity16 to dust that made me absolutely giddy : the primal doomsday terror of a beast created by @entity21 radiation , the model - shop ingenuity , the laughable man - in - a - rubber - suit campiness			1
it 's been 16 years since @entity25 nearly soured that love affair , thanks to @entity29 's 1998 atrocity			1
and i was hopeful that the splashy new @entity31 reboot might rekindle the old flame			0
unfortunately , @entity34 ' " @entity7 " feels like two movies scotch - taped together			1
in one , @entity36 plays a nuclear engineer with a tragic past who 's racing to expose the truth about a series of seismic anomalies , @entity35 is his estranged soldier son , and @entity43 and @entity44 are a pair of exposition - spouting scientists trying to keep straight faces while talking about electromagnetic pulses and mankind 's hubris			1
in the other , mammoth @entity52 beasts knock the snot out of one another			0
only one of these movies is any good			2
thankfully , it 's the monster one			2
@entity34 , whose only previous film was 2010 's low - budget " monsters , " has been given a quick call - up to the majors with the reported $ 160 million " @entity7			1
" he does n't seem too interested in his actors â € ” they 're more plodding than their reptilian costars and you do n't care about a single one of them â € ” but @entity34 does know how to fashion some serious monster mayhem			0
taking a cue from " @entity68 , " he wisely delays @entity7 's appearance , building suspense			1
in movies like these , it 's all about the slow tease and the big reveal			1
as an appetizer , though , he gives us a pair of '' @entity78 '' ( massive unidentified terrestrial organisms ) â € ” a male and female duo of giant , @entity84 creatures with sleek pincer jaws that resemble humongous staple removers			0
the @entity78 , who arrive on the scene after leveling a @entity89 nuclear reactor , care about two things : feeding on the radiation that created them and mating with each other in ... @entity93 of all places			0
when @entity7 first lumbers on screen to hunt the @entity97 and '' restore balance , '' he feels both nostalgically familiar and excitingly new			1
as big as a @entity99 and with a shriek that rumbles your insides , he appears beefier and meaner than you remember			0
but looks can be deceiving			0
godzilla is humanity 's only hope for destroying the @entity97			2
or as @entity43 's dr. @entity108 says , '' let them fight ! '' and fight they do , in an epic clash that turns the @entity112 to rubble			2
unlike last year 's disappointing @entity114 , @entity7 actually shows us its monsters without a scrim of rain and a cloak of darkness			1
and the thrill of the film is getting the chance to fetishize their sheer size and physicality as they rip through power lines and demolish buildings with their lashing tails			2
in its handful of moments like these , " @entity7 " almost makes you feel like a kid again			1
