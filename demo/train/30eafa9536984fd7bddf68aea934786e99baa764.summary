-- the northeast region of the @entity2 got pummeled with snow			1
it was bad , really bad			0
according to the @entity5 , nearly 2 feet of snow fell north of @entity6 while other parts of the @entity8 received as much as 18 inches			1
that was good enough to shut down schools , cancel flights in the region and declare snow emergencies			1
for my city , @entity14 , @entity15 , 18 inches of snow is just another day ; schools operate , companies stay open and people go about their daily routines			1
the @entity22 community , where the @entity23 and the @entity25 end , tops the list as the snowiest city in @entity2 , according to @entity28			1
it averages 326.3 inches of snow each year and has gotten as much as 556.7 inches in one season			1
yet the city manager has said that declaring a snow emergency would be " humiliating			2
" how does a town with a population of nearly 4,000 cope with all that snow ? the plows go out in the early mornings trying to clear the snow before locals head to work and school			2
it 's not smart to be driving during snow removal			2
sometimes you can drive head - on into the path of a snowplow			0
then there are the berms , that barrier of unplowed snow in the @entity49			2
unless you have an suv or a truck that 's high off the ground , making that left turn is n't advised			0
those two obstacles can turn your drive down the street into an adventure			0
during this time , locals are asked not to park in the streets , at risk of getting a ticket			0
where is all that snow stored ? the city uses its local parks as snow dumps			2
they 're green during the summer and white by winter			0
@entity69 is by far the biggest park strip in town			2
there are playgrounds , basketball courts and a large open space for dogs to run around in the park			2
the south end was used as a temporary football field last season			2
all those assets are hidden beneath several feet of snow during the winter			2
next to city hall is another snow storage site , a parking lot that is turned into a two - story high snowcone every winter			2
those are just the public and commercial places			0
during that quick trip to the store , now a little longer because you 're dodging berms and snowplows , you will notice people with snowblowers in the driveways and on the roofs			2
some residents have their own snowplows			0
most just push the snow to the sidewalks and let the city crews do the rest			2
for me , @entity14 was a shock			1
i grew up in @entity109 : if 2 inches of snow hit the ground ( stick or melt ) , there was no school for that day			1
i got my first taste of a real winter when i ventured off to college in @entity117			0
i remember sitting in the dorm and watching tv when the first snowstorm of the school year came			0
i thought for sure classes would be canceled			0
every educational institution in the area canceled classes , except mine			0
still in shock from not seeing my college 's name scroll across the bottom of the screen , i bundled up and headed to class			0
when i moved to @entity15 , i had the same thoughts about the @entity133 as everyone else : it 's cold , with igloos and polar bears			1
i thought my @entity139 experience had prepared me for the elements of @entity15			1
my first winter in the state was in @entity143 , a town of more than 2,300 people in @entity15			1
as in the rest of the region , it rains much of the time			0
i saw plenty of snow during my two - year stint there , but it was nothing compared to @entity14			1
people warned me , but i did n't listen			0
i thought i was good with a nice coat , gloves and a decent pair of boots			0
it has been three years since i 've moved here and i still have a sort of love - hate relationship with the snow			2
one thing is clear : it takes a lot of snow for the city to shut schools and businesses			1
that happened during the 2011 - 12 winter			0
after a slow start , @entity15 's south central region was pummeled from december through february			1
it got really bad for @entity14 's regional counterpart , @entity176			1
with the snow dumps full , that city declared a state of emergency and called in the @entity180 to clear out most of the snow			0
@entity14 officials came close to going in that direction after schools and businesses were closed because of excessive snow loads on roofs			1
@entity14 city manager @entity187 said it best during rounds of meetings with the public and other leaders : " @entity14 prides itself on being the snow capital in the world			1
and for us to declare a state of emergency would be humiliating			0
" officials in @entity14 did n't call in the @entity180 , but relied on outside help with snow removal			1
it brought in workers from other parts of the state to help cut blocks of snow off the roofs of schools and businesses			1
a shovel that season was the most valuable tool in town			0
that winter saw seasonal records broken throughout the state			0
@entity214 bragged about breaking its seasonal record with 134.5 inches			0
@entity14 's response : " good for you			1
" it received 152.2 inches in the month of december and closed out with 438.3 inches for the season			1
( @entity14 's record for snowfall in a season was set during the 1989 - 90 winter with 556.7 inches			1
) i 've had plenty of days where my sense of accomplishment from digging out my car from a previous snowfall is taken away minutes later by the next			0
digging out my radio station 's satellite dishes has become a regular winter chore			0
i can get by without studs on my tires , but they sure would make driving easier in those slippery areas			0
one of these days , i 'll get used to the all the snow here in @entity14			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			1

*ex-mississippian* @entity240 now lives in the snow capital of the @entity2
@entity14 , @entity15 , has gotten as much as *550* inches of snow in one season
he says schools remain open , businesses operate after big snowfalls
@entity240 : biggest *problems* are *disposing* of snow and lightening the load of snow on roofs
