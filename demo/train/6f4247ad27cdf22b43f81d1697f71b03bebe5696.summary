this holiday season , i am heading to the only @entity1 i 've ever known			1
to @entity9 dinner with my cousin 's roast pork , her mother - in - law 's flan , platanos maduros , yucca and a salad			1
@entity9 is a @entity13 celebration of @entity14 , and it 's a big night for us			1
there will be quick - fire @entity18 , varying degrees of @entity20 and jokes in the way i 've only ever heard my @entity1 relatives parry back and forth			1
many presents will be opened , and everyone will act like we all got each other the perfect gift			0
i 'm flying not to @entity29 but to @entity30 , where my grandparents and other relatives came years after @entity33 took over @entity1 , when it became clear there would be no free speech for anyone but him			1
the stadiums were filling with " trials " against the enemies of the state , friends were disappearing and my mother , despite her government job , knew her unwillingness to stay quiet while people suffered would get her in trouble			2
so she went into exile in 1961 , and she 's never been back			2
years later my grandparents followed their grown children -- my mother and uncle -- to the @entity54			1
when they applied to leave the country , @entity1 government officials did an inventory of the contents of their home			1
both their home and all of their things would be confiscated by the government on the day they departed			0
the morning she left , my abuelita was washing the dishes in their apartment before she and my grandfather left for the airport			0
" let @entity33 do the dishes , " she said			0
i have never seen that apartment			0
family traditions when we land tuesday in @entity30 , my mother and uncle will meet us at the airport and rush us to @entity76 's or some coffee stand where i can get a real @entity1 coffee -- none of this @entity81 silliness			1
there 's a hint of @entity1 in the taste			1
and @entity1 and @entity54 flags will be everywhere			1
i do n't care about @entity86 or @entity87 or @entity88			0
every bit of @entity1 i get is gleaned from pictures , music , stories people tell me and these trips to see @entity30 family , where i get hints of my ancestry in the food and jokes and presents			1
i soak it up on every visit			2
i 've never seen the sleepy , agricultural town of @entity104 where my mother was born and lived until her teenage years			0
i 've never seen where she went to high school after they moved to @entity29 or the beaches where she swam in the summertime and where one friend dangling his foot over a pier lost it to a shark			0
i do n't know where she had her first piano recital			0
when she plays my favorite @entity1 music on the piano , all too rarely , for some reason the notes make me cry			2
maybe it 's the hints of her life before me			0
the @entity14 heat in @entity30 must be similar to what they feel in @entity1 , only a short flight to the south			1
i will pack my summer clothes and a bathing suit for my daughter			0
around midday on christmas eve some of us will head to @entity134 for lunch and @entity1 sandwiches			2
i will get my favorite @entity138 soda , too sweet for me now but still worth the memory			0
my cousin , whose @entity9 pork would make @entity142 cry , likes to tease us to not to fill up at lunch			0
but we will be fine			0
dinner wo n't be until much later -- our family is always late -- and we all want her cooking			0
filling in the gaps my definition of beauty is n't blond hair or blue eyes or any classic @entity54 stereotype			2
it 's my black - haired @entity1 cousins , who look so refined and elegant			1
they hug me , the baby of my generation and the half - @entity54 with the brown hair , so hard			1
they remind me to come back			0
to @entity30 , not to @entity1			1
i 've only seen pictures of the tobacco trucks			0
my mother was taught to drive by the drivers at the tobacco trucking company where my grandfather worked , and it 's why she still drives a car like she means business			2
another hint of @entity1 on those long road trips			2
i welcome the news of thawing @entity54 relations with @entity1 and easing of travel restrictions			1
but i am tired of the ads for religious charity trips to @entity1 and all - inclusive beach resorts where tourists get pampered while my people , once removed , depend on charity for the most basic medical supplies			1
i am tired of the reasons for the sadness in my older relatives ' eyes			0
i do n't want to hear any more stereotypes about who my people are or tourists talking about going to visit @entity1 " before it changes			1
" as @entity187 has written , i do n't want to hear about your @entity1 vacation			2
i simply want to buy a plane ticket and go there myself			0
i want to go to my mother 's hometown and see where she was born without crying the entire trip			1
i want to put those hints together , fill in the gaps and see for the first time , where i am from .			0

she will celebrate @entity14 with her @entity1 - @entity54 relatives in @entity30
