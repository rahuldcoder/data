searchers have found the tail section of @entity3 in the murky depths of the @entity5 , raising hopes that the plane 's black boxes and the precious information they hold might soon be recovered			1
the tail section , marked with part of the airline 's logo , was detected by sonar early wednesday , said @entity15 , the head of @entity18 's search and rescue agency			1
divers were sent to the location and plunged into the waves			2
down on the sea floor , they were able to take pictures of the wreckage			2
finding the tail section is a potentially vital step in the investigation because that is where the flight data and voice recorders -- the so - called black boxes -- are located in the @entity33 , the aircraft model of @entity3			1
" the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder are absolutely crucial to gaining an understanding of what happened to this aircraft , " said @entity35 , the managing editor of @entity36 , an aviation industry website			1
are the black boxes there ? but it 's still uncertain if the black boxes are in the piece of wreckage the searchers discovered			2
" i am led to believe the tail section has been found , " tweeted @entity51 ceo @entity50			1
" if right part of tail section then the black box should be there			1
" that 's assuming the flight recorders did n't come loose as the plane went down and hit the water			1
" it 's by no means certain that the recorders are located within the tail , " @entity61 said , noting that searchers have n't reported detecting any pings from the black boxes ' locator beacons			1
" they might have fallen free , which could create some issues , " he said			2
vital information the recorders are generally considered the key piece of evidence when it comes to investigating a commercial plane disaster			1
the data recorder provides a wide range of valuable information about what the plane was doing , from its air speed to the position of the landing gear			2
the cockpit voice recorder captures communications between the pilots			2
in this case , officials hope it will contain any possible discussion of the crisis that eventually brought down the jet , @entity61 said			0
investigators will be looking for answers why @entity3 dropped off radar and went down december 28			0

divers to keep looking @entity15 said wednesday that divers were preparing to go back underwater in the same area , which is in one of the priority zones where search efforts have been focused			1
he did n't say at what depth the tail section had been found			1
" elements are also still conducive for another search			1
they also are striving to find the black box , " @entity15 told @entity18 's @entity115			0
one of the images released by the search agency showed what appeared to be the letters a and @entity122 ; another showed the word " @entity125 " from the @entity3 logo			1

it was flying from the @entity18 city of @entity137 to @entity138			0
search teams had located several large pieces of wreckage believed to be from the plane but none of them as significant as the tail			1
