-- does the @entity1 have room for one more social network ? @entity4 thinks so			2
with @entity5 hogging the spotlight last week and @entity7 working to stay in the game with @entity9 , @entity4 has quietly launched @entity10 , which it describes as a social - search tool to share information and meet people with common interests			1
what it 's not , @entity4 says , is a rival to @entity5			1
" @entity10 is an experimental research project focused on the future of social experiences and learning , especially among younger people , " @entity4 said monday in an e-mail			2
the tool was launched late last year for students at a handful of colleges and universities			0
last week , the company quietly made it available to anyone for a public beta test period			0
among the features of @entity10 ( pronounced , of course , " social " ) is a " bookmarklet " feature similar to @entity5 's " like " button			1
that lets users share sites or pages they find interesting with other users			1
you can share , comment on or tag other people 's posts			0
@entity10 also has a " video party " feature that lets users chat with others and incorporate videos into those chats			1
the tool comes from @entity4 's @entity53 , which works with product research and development teams on new web and social tools			1
the initial focus on students still shines through			0
with @entity10 , users can build posts with many elements -- such as photos , video and text -- and share them			2
it also lets them find other users with similar interests and build communities around specific goals , educational or otherwise			0
the researchers behind @entity10 deliberately sought to collaborate with a student audience that is more holistic -- encompassing representation from the sciences as well as the humanities -- rather than simply technical , says @entity75 , general manager of @entity53			0
just do n't call it @entity4 's answer to @entity5			1
@entity7 and smaller rivals have struggled to gain a foothold in a social - media landscape that @entity5 dominates			0
on @entity10 's faq page , @entity4 makes it clear that their new tool is designed as a layer on top of existing networks			1
" we expect students to continue using products such as @entity5 , @entity91 , @entity92 and other existing social networks , as well as @entity94 , @entity7 and other search tools , " it says			2
" we hope to encourage students to reimagine how our everyday communication and learning tools can be improved by researching , learning and sharing in their everyday lives			0

@entity4 's social search tool , @entity10 , is now available to the public
the tool ( pronounced " social " ) lets users share web content with others
designers say it 's not meant as a @entity5 competitor
@entity114 had been available to some college students since last year
