-- when @entity1 signed a multi-million dollar deal to add @entity3 to their ranks they must have salivated at the thought of the world 's top player going head - to - head with stablemate @entity10			1
imagine the marketing potential of their twin titans battling it out down the stretch at major championships for years to come , bedecked , of course , in @entity1 gear			0
that dream may well be realized in time , and @entity10 at least has one title to his name this year , but at the most high - profile tournament of 2013 to date both crashed and burned at the first hurdle			1
@entity25 was eliminated in the first round of the @entity27 by @entity29 's @entity28 in @entity30 , to add to his missed cut at his only other appearance this year , in @entity32			1
woods , the world no. 2 , did n't fare any better , losing to @entity35 the other two top seeds , @entity38 's @entity37 and @entity40 's @entity39 , the world no. 3 , went safely through to round two			1
@entity3 squandered early chances against @entity28 , who came to life on the back nine , chipping in for birdie at 11 and 12 before an eagle at 13 put him in the driving seat			1
the @entity47 won 16 to reduce the deficit to one shot but @entity28 , ranked 68 , held firm to sink a four - foot putt at the last to claim a famous triumph			1
" i did n't make enough birdies in the end , " @entity3 told the @entity54 's official website			1
" @entity28 had a nice little stretch around part of the back nine			1
i hung in there , but i just did n't do enough			0
" " deep down i knew i could beat him , " a jubilant @entity28 said			1
" i 'm not here for no reason			0
i 'm not here to make up the numbers			0
" i said to @entity65 , my caddie , walking down 11 or 12 , ' he 's not liking this one bit			0
he 's the one under pressure , i 've got nothing to lose , so let 's have a go from here			2
' " i 'm feeling quite good now , but it 's important not to get too high now because it 's only the first round , and i 've got another match tomorrow			2
" heavy snow curtailed the first day and delayed the start on thursday as the course was prepared for play			0
and in fading light , @entity10 and @entity35 decided to continue playing in near gloom to reach a conclusion			1
woods squared the game on 13 but @entity35 birdied the 15th and 16th to go two up , wrapping the match up on the 17th			2
woods was naturally disappointed in defeat but was pleased with his performance			0
" i played well , i really did , " @entity10 said			2
" i hit a lot of good shots out there			0
" it 's the nature of the format			0
you 've just got to beat the guy you 're playing against , and i did n't do that today			0
" elsewhere , defending champion @entity100 moved into the second round after a comprehensive 5 & 4 victory over @entity103			1
@entity39 , the 2011 champion , fought hard to beat @entity105 's @entity104 on the final hole while fellow @entity40 , and @entity110 @entity109 hero , @entity107 beat @entity111 2 & 1			0
@entity112 edged a close game with @entity114 , @entity115 defeated @entity116 while 2012 @entity117 champion @entity117 and 2012 @entity119 winner @entity118 moved into round two			0
there were other high - profile departures in the form of 2011 @entity126 pga champion @entity124 , @entity127 and 2012 @entity129 winner @entity128 .			2

@entity10 and @entity3 both lose in first round of @entity27
@entity134 's top two players fall at the first hurdle in @entity30 to players outside the top *60*
@entity3 is beaten by @entity29 's @entity28 while @entity35 defeats @entity139
defending champ @entity100 through but @entity124 and @entity141 are out
