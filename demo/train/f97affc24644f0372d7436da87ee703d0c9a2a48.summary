words have been a part of @entity3 's life as far back as she could remember			1
she would devour children 's books sitting in her mother 's lap , dreaming up adventures of her own she wanted to share			2
but the @entity10 bestselling author never thought her passion for writing could earn her a living , so she set her sights on a career in law , spending years diligently poring over law books to pass the bar			1
" i was going to be a lawyer and i had studied hard , " @entity3 says , " but then it suddenly occurred to me in a very deep , profound way that i did n't want to keep practicing law for the rest of my life , " she adds			1
follow the dream @entity3 was struck with the impulse to fulfill her dream of writing a novel , and brushing off concerns from those around her , she closed herself off in her apartment for a month to write			1
she worked feverishly for 14 hours a day , producing her first novel -- a paranormal magic thriller called " @entity35 "			2
her leap of faith paid off , and the book was bought by a publishing house and turned into a four - sequel contract			2
nine years after her debut , the 35 year - old is a celebrated writer with 17 novels to her name and myriad of literary awards			0
" i had my dreams , and even though everyone told me that they were n't practical , i knew in my heart that this is what i had to do			0
even if it ended up being a failure , i had to make the attempt , " she says			0
expanding the portfolio apart from traditional novels , @entity3 also found her calling in comic books			1
she has written issues for @entity61 ' " @entity60 " and " @entity62 " series , for which she was nominated for a @entity64 for outstanding media images of the lgbt community last year			1
@entity3 also teaches comic book writing at @entity68 , even though she only became familiar with the genre at college after stumbling across it in a local bookstore			1
" i did n't know how to write comics , i had to teach myself , " she says , " i had never been a comic book person before really because i had no access to them			0
once i had access i thought that these are just another avenue for telling stories and delving into the imagination " she adds			0
in spite of managing to turn her passion into her job , @entity3 does n't regret the years she spent toiling away at law school : " there was no guarantee that this would work out			2
i do n't want to give people the wrong advice to follow their dreams no matter what because it 's not fun to be a starving artist			0

work hard , study hard at it and do n't give up , " she says .			0
