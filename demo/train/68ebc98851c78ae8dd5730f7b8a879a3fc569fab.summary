-- the long - icy relations between @entity2 and the @entity3 began to thaw almost as soon as @entity4 , @entity2 's new president , assumed office			1
@entity4 has promised to regain the trust of the international community when it comes to his country 's nuclear program and pull @entity2 's economy out of the mire through a series of moves that reflect a change of approach in @entity17			1
a clear strategy shift @entity4 received mixed signals from pro-reform and conservative camps upon his return from the @entity24 meeting in late september			2
in @entity2 it is @entity26 , not @entity4 , who has the final say on foreign policy			2
and the supreme leader has frequently extended his approval to the president 's plan to normalize relations with the @entity3 and resolve the nuclear deadlock			1
the shift of @entity2 rhetoric in the weeks running up to this week 's nuclear negotiations in @entity38 has not been limited to the supreme leader 's support of the direct talks with the @entity3 @entity42 , the head of @entity2 's parliament , has also expressed support for a recalibration of @entity2 's approach to nuclear talks			1
toning down the anti-americanism the debate over whether or not anti-american slogans should be stopped as a trust - building gesture has been intense in @entity2			2
since the establishment of the @entity53 in 1979 , " down with the @entity3 " has been a widely used slogan at friday prayers and national rallies , but a number of senior clergymen have expressed their support for ending the use of such terms			2
analysis : why there 's room for a deal with @entity2 former president @entity66 has gone even further , recently declaring on his website that @entity68 , the founder of the republic , had never approved of anti-american slogans			1
although the revolutionary outlook of the establishment has , to some extent , faded over three and a half decades of the revolution , such statements by a senior political figure are unheard of in @entity2			0
a softer approach to @entity77 the official tune by the administration regarding @entity77 has also significantly changed			0
since @entity4 's trip to @entity81 -- and in a dramatic break from the rhetoric of former president @entity84 -- the country 's officials have acknowledged and condemned the @entity87 and cancelled an annual @entity89 conference that was scheduled to take place just weeks before this week 's nuclear talks			1
the moves perhaps indicate a mutual understanding between @entity94 and @entity17 that the success of future negotiations may depend on a green light from @entity77			0
@entity2 would also like to see the risk of a possible @entity77 strike against its nuclear sites completely eradicated -- a possibility that can only come about through if @entity2 eliminates its own existential threats against the state of @entity77			2
gestures born of desperation ? @entity2 may have shifted the rhetoric in recent weeks , but although @entity4 and his team have a track record of moderation in their political careers -- especially in comparison to their predecessors -- the recent moves would most likely not have been taken if @entity2 's economy was n't crumbling due to @entity117 sanctions			1
@entity117 sanctions as a result of @entity2 's uranium enrichment are costing @entity2 up to $ 5 billion a month			2
@entity2 's oil production is down by about a million barrels per day and its exports are at the lowest levels since the @entity125 in the 1980s			0
the effect of sanctions are becoming unbearable for the @entity2 government and there is now a palpable sense of urgency in its approach to resolving the nuclear issue			0
analysis : @entity3 " clear - eyed " but hopeful on @entity2 talks despite the urgency to get a deal done , @entity2 leaders will not overextend themselves when it comes to concessions to the @entity141 over its nuclear program			1
@entity2 do not want to be portrayed as desperate due to sanctions , and face - saving -- especially domestically -- will be an important element of @entity2 's strategy			1
@entity17 also does n't seem to have a rigid and pre-defined agenda for the negotiations -- they will probably just kick off the diplomatic ping pong and see how many concessions they can get out of the talks			0
what comes next ? recently @entity2 foreign minister @entity155 said the previous rounds of negotiations between @entity2 and the @entity159 nations -- the @entity3 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 -- benefited no one , and that their only outcome has been unfair economic sanctions on @entity2			1
@entity2 has always claimed its nuclear program exists solely for sustainable development and to meet the country 's energy demands -- and that its enrichment program has only been a reaction to @entity162 firm @entity174 's refusal to give @entity2 enriched uranium , despite @entity2 owning 20 % of the firm			0
@entity2 officials have also repeatedly argued that the country informed the @entity179 180 days prior to enriching uranium , meaning that @entity2 has never been in violation of @entity179 laws			0
i believe the likeliest outcome of these negotiations will be a concession by the @entity3 to give @entity2 the right to enrich uranium to 5 percent			0
if that is decided , the most recent agreement of the @entity159 will replace corresponding @entity24 resolutions on the same -- and perhaps more significantly , it will pave the way for more talks in the future			0
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity197 .			0

new @entity2 president @entity4 has worked to thaw @entity3 - @entity2 relations in recent months
some @entity2 clergymen believe " down with the @entity3 " slogans should be *dropped* from prayers
@entity2 has also adopted a softer stances towards @entity77 since @entity4 's visit to the @entity24
@entity197 : @entity208 likely would n't have happened without *crippling* sanctions
