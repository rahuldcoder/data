i am a @entity2 , but i was n't always			1
i converted to @entity3 in november 2001 , two months after 9/11			1
i was 21 and living in @entity5 , @entity6			1
it was a bad time to be a @entity2			1
but after four years of studying , poking and prodding at world religions and their adherents , i decided to take the plunge			2
questions and answers i am the product of a @entity13 and an @entity15 atheist			2
i grew up @entity13 , then was agnostic , now i 'm @entity2			1
my journey to @entity3 began when i was about 15 years old in mass , and had questions about my faith			1
the answers from teachers and clergymen -- do n't worry your pretty little head about it -- did n't satisfy me			2
so i did what any red - blooded @entity27 would do : the opposite			2
i questioned the nature of religion , man , and the universe			2
after questioning everything i was taught to be true and digging through rhetoric , history and dogma , i found out about this strange thing called @entity3			1
i learned that @entity3 is neither a culture nor a cult , nor could it be represented by one part of the world			1
i came to realize @entity3 is a world religion that teaches tolerance , justice and honor , and promotes patience , modesty and balance			1
as i studied the faith , i was surprised many of the tenants resonated with me			2
i was pleased to find that @entity3 teaches its adherents to honor all prophets , from @entity56 to @entity57 to @entity58 , all of whom taught mankind to worship one @entity62 and to conduct ourselves with higher purpose			1
i was drawn to @entity3 's appeal to intellect and heartened by the prophet @entity58 's quote , " the acquisition of knowledge is compulsory for every @entity2 , whether male or female			1
" i was astounded that science and rationality were embraced by @entity2 thinkers like @entity76 , who invented algebra ; @entity78 , who developed the mechanics of flight before @entity81 ; and @entity82 , who is the father of modern surgery			1
here was a religion telling me to seek out answers and use my intellect to question the world around me			1
taking the plunge it was 2001 and i had been putting off converting for a while			2
i feared what people would think , but was utterly miserable			2
when 9/11 happened , the actions of the hijackers horrified me			2
but in its aftermath , i spent most of my time defending @entity2 and their religion to people who were all too eager to paint a group of 1.6 billion people with one brush because of the actions of a few			1
i was done being held hostage by the opinions of others			2
in defending @entity3 , i got over my fear and decided to join my brothers and sisters in the faith i believed in			1
my family did not understand , but it was n't a surprise to them since i had been studying religion			2
most were very concerned for my safety			2
luckily , most of my friends were cool about it , and even curious to learn more			2
the scarf these days , i am a proud wearer of hijab			0
you can call it a scarf			0
my scarf does not tie my hands behind my back , and it is not a tool of oppression			0
it does n't prevent thoughts from entering my head and leaving my mouth			0
but i did n't always know this			0
studying @entity3 did n't immediately dispel all my cultural misconceptions			1
i had been raised on imagery of women in the @entity137 being treated like chattel by men who forced them to cover their bodies out of shame or a sense of ownership			0
but when i asked a @entity2 woman " why do you wear that ? " , her answer was obvious , and appealing : " to please @entity62			1
to be recognized as a woman who is to be respected and not harassed			0
so that i can protect myself from the male gaze			0
" she explained how dressing modestly is a symbol to the world that a woman 's body is not meant for mass consumption or critique			0
i still was n't convinced and replied , " yeah , but women are like second class citizens in your faith ? " the very patient @entity2 lady explained that , during a time when the western world treated women like property , @entity3 taught that men and women were equal in the eyes of @entity62			1
@entity3 made the woman 's consent to marriage mandatory and gave women the opportunity to inherit , own property , run businesses and participate in government			1
she listed right after right that women in @entity3 held nearly 1250 years before women 's lib was ever thought of in the @entity181			1
surprisingly , @entity3 turned out to be the religion that appealed to my feminist ideals			1
getting married it might shock you to know that i had an arranged marriage			0
that does n't mean i was forced to marry my father 's first choice suitor , like @entity189 from @entity190			0
@entity191 did n't even have a say			0
when i converted , it was n't a good time to be a @entity2			1
feeling isolated , alienated and rejected by my own society pushed me to want to start a family of my own			0
even before converting i had always wanted a serious relationship , but found few men looking for the same			2
as a new muslim , i knew there was a better way to look for love and a lifelong partnership			0
i decided that if i wanted a serious relationship , it was time to get serious about finding one			0
i wanted an arranged marriage			0
i made a list of " @entity209 " - style deal breakers			0
i interrogated friends and families of prospects			0
i decided i wanted to marry another convert , someone who had been where i was and wanted to go where i wanted to go			0
thanks to parents of friends , i found my now - husband , a convert to @entity3 , in @entity220 , @entity221 , two hours from my @entity223 home			1
twelve years later , we are living happily ever after			0
not every muslim finds a mate in this manner , and i did n't always see this for my life			0
but i am glad @entity3 afforded me this option			1
living in a post- 9/11 world i never had to give up my personality , @entity27 identity or culture to be a @entity2			1
i have , at times , had to give up on being treated with dignity			0
i have been spat on , had eggs thrown at me , and been cursed at from passing cars			0
and i have felt terror when the mosque i attended in @entity242 , @entity243 , was first shot at , then burned down			0
in august 2012 , i moved back home to @entity223 , where being different is the norm			0
i finally felt safe -- for a while			0
but now , with the continuous news coverage of the un-islamic group known as @entity250 , i have been subjected to much of the same treatment i received in other cities			0
and i now feel less safe than i ever have			0
it enrages me to know there are some who call themselves @entity2 and who distort and misappropriate @entity3 for political gains			1
it weighs on me knowing that millions of my countrymen see only these images as a representative of my religion			2
it is unbearable to know that i am passionately hated for my beliefs , when those hating me do n't even know what my beliefs are			0
in my journey to @entity3 , i came to learn that @entity2 come in all shapes , sizes , attitudes , ethnicities , cultures and nationalities			1
i came to know that @entity3 teaches disagreement and that should n't lead to disrespect , as most @entity2 want peace			1
most of all , i have faith that my fellow @entity27 can rise above fear and hatred and come to learn the same			0
the opinions expressed in this story are solely those of @entity284 .			1

@entity284 converted to @entity3 at age 21
she found the religion appealed to her intellect and feminist ideals
" @entity2 come in all shapes , sizes , attitudes , ethnicities , cultures and nationalities , " she writes
