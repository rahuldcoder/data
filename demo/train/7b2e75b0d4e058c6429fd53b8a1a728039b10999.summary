-- the future of @entity2 at @entity3 has been thrown further into confusion after the @entity5 was publicly rebuked by the @entity8 team 's president @entity6 on monday			1
the two - time world champion probably did not expect to receive such an unwanted gift as he celebrated his 32nd birthday			0
rumours linking @entity2 with the possibility of a move to @entity15 , given the departure of @entity17 at the end of season , had swirled around the @entity21 paddock in @entity22 this weekend			1
this followed news of a meeting between @entity2 's manager @entity26 and @entity15 team principal @entity27 on friday			1
the waters were further muddied on sunday when @entity2 , asked what present he would like for his birthday after dropping to third in the championship standings - courtesy of his fifth place at the @entity33 , replied : " someone else 's car			2
" the @entity5 added that improvements were needed if the @entity3 was to win the world championship			1
it is unclear precisely which remarks prompted @entity3 to place a statement on their website explaining how the president " tweaked " @entity2 's ear in a telephone conversation , after comments " which did not go down well with @entity6 , now with anyone in the team			1
" " all the great champions who have driven for @entity3 have always been asked to put the interests of the team above their own , " @entity3 's official website quoted @entity6 as telling @entity2 in a birthday call			1
" this is the moment to stay calm , avoid polemics and show humility and determination in making one 's own contribution , standing alongside the team and its people both at the track and outside it			0
" since joining @entity3 in 2010 , @entity2 has failed to build on the world championships he won in 2005 and 2006 with @entity63			1
he has twice come close to triumphing with @entity3 - only to be beaten by @entity15 driver @entity64 by the narrowest of margins on both occasions			2
@entity2 lost out by four points in 2010 , while last season 's championship saw the @entity71 win an even closer contest - pipping his rival by just three points to win his third straight title			0
following comments made by @entity6 last year , there would be considerable irony if @entity2 were to end up as the stable mate of his major race rival			1
as media reports suggested that @entity64 would move to @entity3 in 2014 , the @entity3 supremo reacted by saying he did not want " two roosters in the same hen house			2
" " i do n't want problems and rivalries , " he added last october			0
@entity64 added further intrigue to the situation on sunday by declaring that he would prefer to be joined at @entity15 next season by @entity90 , rather than @entity91 , on the premise that the @entity93 has always been " very straight " with him			0
after ten races of the season , @entity2 lies third in the standings - his 133 points one fewer than @entity97 driver @entity90 - while @entity64 leads with a tally of 172			0
the @entity5 's contract with @entity3 is not due to expire until 2016			2
in a separate development on monday , @entity3 confirmed that former @entity97 technical director @entity101 will join the team in september			2
@entity104 's departure from @entity97 was revealed in may and he will assume the role of chassis technical director			0
" at the same time , @entity108 will take on the new position of director of engineering , " @entity3 said in a statement			0
" both men will report directly to the @entity112 , @entity113			0
