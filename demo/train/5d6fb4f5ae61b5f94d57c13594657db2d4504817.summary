-- the bachelor sounds like a bigot			1
according to @entity9 , @entity3 -- the former @entity4 soccer player , who is now romancing 27 young ladies on @entity7 's hit reality show , " @entity8 " -- has some strong opinions about gays			1
in response to a question at a network party , on friday @entity3 told the website 's editor , @entity15 that he did n't think it would be good for the show to feature a bachelor who was gay or bisexual			1
the problem is n't what he said about the show			1
he has an opinion , and he 's entitled to it			2
the problem is what comes next : where he explains his reasons for feeling this way			2
he starts off by saying , " i do n't think it is a good example for kids to watch that on tv			1
" a good example for kids ? has @entity3 ever watched the show he 's on ? you have 27 young ladies backstabbing and preening and scheming to get close to a bachelor and get a red rose , and , they hope -- an engagement ring			1
along the way , they proclaim that they 've fallen madly in love with and want to spend the rest of their lives with this person they 've known for all of 45 minutes , when what they want most is to beat out the other women and win the contest			0
is this a good example for kids ? to be fair , in his apology , which @entity3 posted later on his @entity62 page , he noted : " the show is very racy as it is and i do n't let my 5 - year - old daughter watch it			1
" but in his conversation with @entity15 , @entity3 ' comments about gays got worse			1
he went on : " obviously people have their husband and wife and kids and that is how we are brought up			0
now there is fathers having kids and all that , and it is hard for me to understand that too in the sense of a household having peoples			0
... two parents sleeping in the same bed and the kid going into bed			0
" finally , @entity3 said , " there 's this thing about gay people ... it seems to me , and i do n't know if i 'm mistaken or not ... but they 're more ' pervert ' in a sense			1
and to me the show would be too strong ... too hard to watch			2
" ick ! this is too hard to listen to			0
what 's more " pervert " -- romancing and smooth - talking a couple dozen women , in and out of hot tubs , or a loving and monogamous same - sex relationship ? according to @entity101 , @entity7 said this in a statement : " @entity3 's comments were careless , thoughtless and insensitive , and in no way reflect the views of the network , the show 's producers or studio			1
" and here is some added irony			0
the first openly anti-gay " bachelor " also happens to be the first @entity114 " bachelor			1
those of us who are part of this community know all too well that it is still infected with too much homophobia			0
it 's hypocritical for anyone in a group that is forever insisting that the rest of society not only tolerate but celebrate that which makes them different ( i.e. , culture and language ) would then attack another group for being different			2
finally , @entity3 ' statement of contrition saturday on @entity62 also left something to be desired			0
he said this : " i want to apologize to all the people i may have offended because of my comments on having a gay or bisexual bachelor			1
the comment was taken out of context			0
if you listen to the entire interview , there 's nothing but respect for gay people and their families			2
i have many gay friends and one of my closest friends who 's like a brother has been a constant in my life especially during the past 5 months			0
the word pervert was not what i meant to say and i am very sorry about it			2
everyone knows @entity160 is my second language and my vocabulary is not as broad as it is in @entity163 and , because of this , sometimes i use the wrong words to express myself			0
what i meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the tv audience this would be too racy to accept			0
... once again , i 'm sorry for how my words were taken			0
i would never disrespect anyone			0
in the end what else is there to do but play the " i - do n't - speak - @entity160 - so - good " card ? dear @entity7 : my @entity160 is good			1
so , as a @entity179 - born @entity114 , let me be clear : this guy does n't represent me , or reflect what i believe or what i 'm about			1
having him on your network is n't going to make me any more likely to tune in or buy stuff i do n't need from advertisers			2
it just makes me embarrassed			0
by the way , if one of my three kids turns out to be gay , i 'd love them and accept them all the same			0
on the other hand , if any of them ever goes on this dreadful show of yours , they are out of the will			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 says new @entity114 ' bachelor ' made anti-gay comments in interview
he said that gays more ' pervert . ' has he watched his own show , @entity199 asks ?
@entity199 : for someone from a group **discriminate*d* against to *discriminate* himself is ironic
@entity199 : ' bachelor *''* s homophobic comments do n't speak for @entity214
