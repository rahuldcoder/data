@entity0 -- for @entity3 waking up to their newspapers this past sunday , the front pages offered a shocking and repulsive sight			2
photographs of ultra-orthodox children donning yellow stars and striped prison uniforms reminiscent of the @entity10 stared back at them			0
the arresting images were taken at a saturday night rally in @entity0 staged by a radical ultra-orthodox sect to protest what their members claimed was incitement against their community by the media and the @entity3 government			1
the protest , which drew widespread condemnation from all corners of the country , is the latest development in an increasingly acrimonious conflict between members of @entity3 's ultra-orthodox community , known as the @entity29 , against the @entity31 @entity3 mainstream			1
in recent weeks many @entity3 have been waging a high - profile public campaign against attempts by some in the ultra-orthodox community to enforce a strict form of gender segregation and rules of modesty on females outside of their community			1
in cities with larger ultra-orthodox populations this has played out in public buses and in some stores with with @entity29 men insisting on strict separation between men and women			2
in some neighborhoods , billboards with images of women have been defaced -- leading some advertisers to stop using photographs of women in their campaigns			0
the issue hit critical mass , however , with the story of eight - year - old @entity3 girl @entity61			0
in a nationally televised news report , the bespectacled and pony - tailed schoolgirl broke down in tears and expressed terror at the prospect of walking several hundred yards to her school in the mixed community of @entity61 for fear of being spat on and cursed at by ultra-orthodox neighbors who thought @entity75 and her mother were not dressed modestly enough			0
the broadcast sparked a wave of criticism and prompted @entity3 prime minister @entity80 to speak out against the segregation of women , referring to it as " an unacceptable phenomenon that goes against the values of @entity86 and democracy			0
" several thousands @entity3 rallied in @entity88 the next week demanding the government do more to curb the influence of ultra-orthodox elements whom they accused of being a @entity95 - like minority			1
ultra-orthodox leaders have warned warn that their community should not be judged based on the actions of a radical few , and contend that the conflict with other parts of @entity3 society is overblown			1
" the @entity29 community accepts the will of the secular community to live their lives in their neighborhoods as they wish , " says rabbi @entity102 of the @entity104 sect			2
" i do not want to impose myself on the secular public			0
" but the @entity3 mainstream 's divide with the ultra-orthodox community goes much deeper than issues of gender segregation			1
the @entity29 , who make up approximately 10 % of the country according to government figures , are the fastest growing segment of the population and constitute a powerful voting block in @entity3 's coalition government			1
they have used this power to maintain government subsidies for working - age men to study the @entity127 full - time and protect the ability for ultra-orthodox @entity3 to win easy exemptions from compulsory military service			2
these arrangements have prompted a growing sense of resentment and anger among other @entity3 , says author and columnist @entity135			2
" what people are thinking is that this is absolutely unsustainable , " says @entity135			0
" they ca n't go on providing these kinds of subsidies for this kind of lifestyle , especially if it seems that the same people you are subsidizing are going to turn on you and turn on @entity31 everywhere because they do n't like their behavior			0
" while the tensions between the ultra-orthodox and other @entity3 are not likely to result in a major schism anytime soon , @entity135 believes the @entity29 community needs to do a better job at integrating into @entity3 society			1
if not , he says , the schism could become a major crisis for @entity3 in the years ahead .			0
