@entity0 -- @entity2 conjures various images			1
it could be food -- @entity5 , steamed dumplings and the like			0
or kung fu -- @entity8 and his dazzling martial - arts skills or more recently @entity11 's " @entity10			0
" or the giant pandas -- those cuddly creatures as photographed in the nature reserves or as portrayed in the @entity16 blockbuster , " @entity17			0
" or @entity18 -- the other cuddly giant who , until he retired last year , won games and friends in the @entity23			0
stereotypical or not , these are some of @entity2 's " soft power " resources			1
in recent months , @entity2 has been on a " soft power " offensive to improve its national image and increase its global influence			1
@entity2 has hosted the @entity31 and the @entity32 in 2009 -- expensive events which , many experts say , helped enhance the " @entity2 brand			1
" " the @entity40 was very much a positive move in improving @entity2 's @entity42 , " said @entity36 , president for @entity37 in @entity38 , which advises @entity2 and overseas clients			2
" how the country responded to the @entity45 earthquake was another			0
" there are long - term initiatives , too , such as the setting up of @entity49 to promote the @entity2 language and culture			2
akin to @entity53 's @entity52 or the @entity54 , hundreds of these @entity49 have been established in leading universities and colleges around the world			0
" there is a sense that soft power is growing , as more foreigners are aware of @entity2 's successes , get exposed more to its culture and have to consider @entity2 's views on a whole range of global issues , " noted @entity58 , @entity0 - based adviser at @entity59 , a @entity60 public relations company			1
why @entity2 's obsession to project its " soft power " ? soft power , according to @entity79 professor @entity78 , " is the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments			1
" @entity78 cites three ways to affect the behavior of others : â € ¢ you can coerce them with threats , using military power			0
â € ¢ you can induce them with payments , using economic clout			0
â € ¢ or you can attract and co-opt them , using culture , diplomacy and other means and resources			0
" the latter is soft power -- getting others to appreciate you to the extent that their behavior is modified , " explained @entity94			1
" when the first two are exercised judiciously and are combined with the third , they create ' smart power			0
' " " the @entity2 want to exercise greater soft power , " @entity36 added			1
" how they do this is an ongoing challenge and pursuit			0
" as @entity2 becomes richer , modernizes its military and increasingly consumes greater global resources , experts see a growing global concern over @entity2 's rise as a global power			1
optimists say @entity2 will turn into a benign power			1
alarmists warn @entity2 is bound to emerge as an @entity116			2
in a white paper issued in 2005 , @entity2 outlined its intentions to rise peacefully as a global power			1
" @entity2 did not seek hegemony in the past , nor does it and will not do so in the future when it gets stronger , " the white paper said			2
" @entity2 's development will not pose a threat to anyone ; instead it can bring more development opportunities and bigger markets for the rest of the world			1
" but some public opinion polls show @entity2 's soft power offensive remains inadequate			1
a survey by the @entity134 's @entity133 last year noted a significant rise in positive views in a number of countries			0
however , across the 22 nations surveyed , the @entity60 generally received more favorable marks than @entity2			2
in the @entity60 , @entity141 , @entity53 , @entity142 and @entity143 , the survey showed , those who see @entity2 as the world 's leading economic power believed this is a bad thing			1
those who named the @entity60 tended to think it is a good thing			0
experts partly blame this on poor communications			0
ahead of @entity2 's transition of leadership later this year , @entity2 has tightened its control of the media and continued its repression of dissent			1
" @entity2 hurts itself when it flouts its own laws and international norms on human rights , " @entity58 said			2
" this tarnishes its image			0
" " what they do wrong is that they traditionally have had a tendency to only want to project positive news , and this often is seen clouding the truth , " @entity36 noted			0
@entity170 , the former director of the @entity171 and an advocate of public diplomacy , acknowledges the limits of official propaganda			0
" for a long time , the international community has been cynical towards the traditional @entity2 voice , believing that it 's mostly official propaganda with political agenda , so it 's not very credible and interesting , " @entity170 said in a recent online forum			2
@entity170 admonished ordinary @entity2 to engage in public diplomacy			2
" we @entity2 should be good at storytelling , to use soft ways of communications to create the so - called ' @entity2 image , ' " he said			1
experts -- like @entity189 , a veteran @entity2 - watcher and senior counselor at @entity191 , a public relations consulting company -- agree			2
" the @entity2 students , the emigrants and business people who are scattered around the world -- and the @entity2 individuals whom foreigners meet in @entity2 -- are the country 's soft power			1
they have many friends and admirers who through them have great affection for the @entity2 people , their incredible work ethic and accomplishments , " he said			2
after 30 years of rapid economic and social changes , @entity2 struggles to project an international profile that befits the second biggest economy in the world			1
@entity189 thinks @entity2 's dilemma is more deep - seated and long - term			0
" i think the world respects @entity2 's economic accomplishments and has great admiration for the @entity2 people , " he said			1
" but the @entity2 government has almost no soft power in the world			1
you need a leading ideology that resonates with the world and a system of ethics and governing that people admire			0
@entity2 does n't have that right now			0

@entity2 on " soft power " offensive to improve image , increase influence
control of media tightening before transition of leadership this year
@entity2 is now second the second biggest economy in the world
