@entity1 's government lifted its ban on a controversial mining process known as hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , thursday , allowing companies to continue their exploration of shale gas reserves			1
energy secretary @entity9 said the decision was subject to new controls to limit the risks of seismic activity			2
a halt was called to fracking last year after two small earthquakes in @entity17 , northwestern @entity18 , where @entity19 was exploring for shale gas			1
the process involves pumping millions of gallons of water and chemicals into shale formations deep beneath the @entity27 's surface , causing the fracturing of the rock and the release of natural gas			1
it has proved controversial in the @entity33 , where supporters say it provides cheap energy but critics are concerned about the potential for chemicals to seep into the drinking water supply			2
the new controls imposed by the @entity1 @entity41 include a requirement to carry out a seismic survey before work starts			0
firms involved must also draw up a plan showing how the seismic risks will be limited , and monitor seismic activity before , during and after the exploration			0
@entity19 said thursday 's decision to allow fracking to resume marked a significant step for @entity1 's future onshore gas industry			1
" today 's news is a turning point for the country 's energy future			0
shale gas has the potential to create jobs , generate tax revenues , reduce our reliance on imported gas , and improve our balance of payments , " chief executive @entity58 said in a statement			1
in an interview with @entity69 , @entity58 insisted that @entity51 could be done " safely and sensibly " in @entity1 and that there are huge reserves to be exploited			1
the company believes there is about 200 trillion cubic feet of gas under the ground just within its license area in @entity17			0
to put that figure into context , the @entity1 uses about 3 trillion cubic feet of gas a year , @entity58 said			1
he said he could understand that people are concerned but pointed out that the two tremors triggered in april and may of last year " were not major events			2
" the website of the @entity84 shows it has recorded nine tremors of a similar magnitude in the past two months , he said			0
" they are not life - threatening events or damage - inducing events , but they do cause concern , so as a consequence the fracking was suspended , " he said			0
@entity19 has done a lot of work since then , he said , including carrying out @entity97 mapping of the area			2
extensive arrays will be installed around the wells to monitor seismic activity , he added			0
as for concerns about how the liquids used in fracking will affect water supplies , @entity58 said the company uses only one friction - reducing chemical , in small quantities			2
he said it is not hazardous and the government oversees its use			0
the strong regulatory environment in the @entity1 " will stand us in good stead , " @entity58 said , although he acknowledged it would mean the pace of exploration may be slower than in the @entity33			0
the process has sparked opposition in the @entity1			0
the government announcement marks " the start of a major battle over what sort of world we will leave to our children , " said @entity127 , an activist with the @entity129 campaign group			0
" the government and industry 's promises of cheap , abundant gas are deluded , " she said , adding that in the @entity33 , " the gas bubble has already burst " and some fracking companies are on the verge of bankruptcy			1
" the government 's strategy of relying on fracking to fuel a new wave of gas - fired power stations is utterly insane			1
fracking is dirty , destructive and extremely expensive , and could never deliver the quantities of gas envisaged			1

fracking can be done " safely and sensibly , " the chief executive of @entity19 says
measures must be put in place to limit the risk of triggering earthquakes , government says
fracking was halted last year after it caused two small tremors in northwestern @entity18
opponents : it 's a dirty process , and promises of cheap , abundant gas are " deluded "
