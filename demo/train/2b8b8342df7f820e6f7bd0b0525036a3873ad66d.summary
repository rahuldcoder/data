@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on tuesday blocked a lawsuit challenging the federal government 's sweeping electronic eavesdropping on suspected foreign terrorists and spies			1
the case put personal liberty at odds with national security , making it one of the most important rulings of the high court 's term			2
the 5 - 4 conservative majority concluded the plaintiffs -- which included attorneys and journalists -- lacked " standing " or jurisdiction to proceed , without proof that suspects have been eavesdropped upon			1
the super secret @entity25 has in turn refused to disclose specifics , which detractors call " @entity29 " logic			0
justice @entity30 said plaintiffs " can not demonstrate that the future injury they purportedly fear is certainly impending			1
" the justices did not address the larger questions of the program 's constitutionality , and this ruling will make it harder for future lawsuits to proceed			1
at issue : can these @entity3 plaintiffs who deal with overseas clients and co-workers file suit if they reasonably suspect -- but can not know for sure -- that the government was reading and hearing their sensitive communications ? the @entity48 was revised by @entity49 in 2008 to give the attorney general and the director of national intelligence greater authority to order " mass acquisition " of electronic traffic from suspected foreign terrorists or spies			1
the law previously required the government to justify a national security interest before any monitoring of phone calls and e-mails originating in another country			2
a federal judge had to sign any search warrant			0
the larger issue involves the constitutionality of the federal government 's electronic monitoring of targeted foreigners			1
a federal appeals court in @entity71 ruled against the @entity73 administration , prompting the current appeal			0
after such " warrantless wiretapping " was exposed , president @entity75 and his congressional allies moved to amend the existing law , which supporters say is designed to target only foreigners living outside the @entity3			0
@entity30 said that there were enough legal safeguards to ensure that any information gathered by the @entity25 would be used properly in court , and that a judicial @entity48 panel could review any particular surveillance			0
" if the government were to prosecute one of the ( plaintiffs ' ) foreign clients using authorized surveillance , the government would be required to make a disclosure , " @entity30 said			1
he was supported by chief justice @entity94 and justices @entity95 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
in dissent , justice @entity99 said the harm claimed by the plaintiffs " is not speculative			1
indeed it is as likely to take place as are most future events that commonsense inference and ordinary knowledge of human nature tell us will happen			0
" he was backed by justices @entity110 , @entity112 and @entity113			2
groups like the @entity115 and @entity116 told the court that little is known about the @entity118 , such as who has been targeted , how often it has been used and whether any problems or abuses have occurred			0
a key point of contention was whether those amendments would stifle free speech of the work of lawyers , journalists and activists by forcing them to do their jobs less diligently , for fear of being monitored and perhaps prosecuted			0
solicitor general @entity134 , speaking for the @entity133 , said that to the contrary , if the lawyer " took precautions , it would be because of a belief that ( he or she ) had to comply with an ethics rule , and the ethics rule would be the cause of ( him or her ) taking those precautions			0
" either way , he said , there was no " concrete application " of the law permitting someone to come into court and make a claim based on " speculation			0
" the case is @entity156 ( 11 - 1025 ) .			2

in dissent , justice says the harm claimed by plaintiffs " is not speculative "
@entity2 's conservative 5 - 4 majority says plaintiffs lack " standing " to proceed
justices did *n't* address the larger questions of government program 's constitutionality
