" it allows the prosecutor to force her to testify in front of the jury without taking the @entity25 " ( @entity26 against self incrimination ) , @entity4 legal analyst @entity19 said of the order			0
" if she lies , she can still be prosecuted for perjury because a grant of immunity never ( immunizes ) someone against committing perjury on the witness stand			1

he has also pleaded not guilty to weapons charges			1
his co-defendants , @entity39 and @entity40 , have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately			1
@entity9 has been a regular at hearings for @entity2			1
he has often been seen mouthing " i love you " to her			0
@entity9 is on the prosecution 's witness list			1
it is not known whether her testimony will help or hurt @entity2			2
" normally , a fiancée is not going to testify adversely against her true love , " said @entity19 , a former @entity49 homicide prosecutor			0
but there is no privilege in @entity11 allowing engaged couples to avoid testifying against one another			0
prosecutors suspect @entity9 of following instructions from @entity2 to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box , putting it in a black trash bag , and borrowing her sister 's car to take the bag to a dumpster and throw it away			1
according to court documents , she does n't remember where			0
her sister was the girlfriend of the victim and has already testified against @entity2			2
prosecutors said @entity9 , @entity2 's high school sweetheart , lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in their @entity78 home , among other issues			1
she faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges			1
she has pleaded not guilty			2
@entity9 and @entity2 are the parents of a daughter who was less than a year old when her father was arrested on june 26 , 2013			2
@entity87 ' sister @entity86 was dating @entity36 , 27 , who was shot six times , according to prosecutors			2
who 's who in @entity2 case prosecutors allege that on the day after @entity36 's killing , @entity9 got a coded text message from @entity2			1
search warrants said @entity2 asked @entity9 to get something out of their basement			2
" go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u ( sic ) get home an ( sic ) there is a box ... jus ( sic ) in case u were looking for it ! ! ! member ( sic ) how you ruined the big tv ... @entity112 bout that lol wink wink love u ttyl ...			0
@entity114 " @entity115 is shorthand for " talk to you later			0
" the evidence against @entity2 : what 's in , what 's out a home surveillance video shows @entity9 leaving the house about an hour later carrying something " rigid " she described as a box , court documents state			1
she placed it inside a garbage bag , covered it with children 's clothing , and carried the bag to a car and drove away , prosecutors said			0
@entity9 borrowed her sister 's car , something her sister told investigators she had never done before			0
when @entity9 returned home , she was seen on the same security system but without the " rigid " item			0
@entity9 told a grand jury she threw the item in a dumpster but could n't remember where , according to prosecutors			0
prosecutors suspect the murder weapon was inside			0
it has not been found			0
@entity2 's lawyers have argued there 's no way of knowing what was in the box			1
" i mean , who knows ? " @entity2 co-counsel @entity155 told the court in 2014			2
" it could be drugs , it could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about , that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact			0
there are all kinds of possibilities			0
" @entity2 's defense team has filed a motion demanding to know what promises prosecutors may have made to @entity9			1
if she made a deal for a lesser charge or immunity , the jury will have to take it into account			0
" the jury is going to look at that and say , ' you know something ? he must be guilty if even his fiancée would say that , ' " said @entity19			2
" or the defense would convince them that she 's made such a sweet deal with the prosecution that she 's decided to lie to implicate her lover , " he added			2
@entity19 suggested that if @entity9 is put on the stand as a prosecution witness and repeats her grand jury testimony that she threw out the item without knowing what was inside and ca n't remember where she disposed of it , she could put herself in greater legal jeopardy			0
that 's because , @entity19 said , prosecutors could later contend at a perjury trial that she repeated an alleged lie under oath			1
" it 's going to increase her guilt if the prosecutor pursues perjury charges , " @entity19 said			1
@entity4 's @entity209 contributed to this report .			0
