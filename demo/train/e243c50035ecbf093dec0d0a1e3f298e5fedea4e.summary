@entity0 expressed outrage tuesday at a top telecommunication official 's push to get social media sites to screen content considered defamatory to religious and political leaders			1
telecommunications minister @entity7 told reporters tuesday that he is asking @entity9 , @entity10 and other online sites to regulate content before it is published			2
@entity7 insisted such regulation would not amount to censorship , but @entity0 bloggers and online users posted a different view			1
# @entity18 was trending on @entity10 tuesday			0
and blogger @entity19 urged @entity0 to use the hashtag and post it on their @entity9 pages " because there may soon be a day when he may prevent you from doing so			1
" @entity7 said he first approached providers including @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity26 several weeks ago			2
the @entity27 reported that @entity7 showed the service providers a @entity9 page that maligned @entity31 president @entity30 and said it was " unacceptable			1
" but he said that in a meeting monday , those companies informed him they could not do what he was asking			0
" they pretty much said they can not do anything , " he said , adding that material that is incendiary or blasphemous has no place in @entity0 , where sensitivities differ from those in the @entity40			2
sites like @entity9 already have built - in mechanisms to flag and filter defined categories of objectionable content			0
in a statement sent to @entity52 's sister network , @entity53 , @entity9 said : " we want @entity9 to be a place where people can discuss things freely , while respecting the rights and feelings of others , which is why we already have policies and on - site features in place that enable people to report abusive content			2
we will remove any content that violates our terms , which are designed to keep material that is hateful , threatening , incites violence or contains nudity off the service			0
we recognize the government 's interest in minimizing the amount of abusive content that is available online and will continue to engage with the @entity0 authorities as they debate this important issue			1
" @entity7 's proposal is " extremely worrying , " but the idea is not new one in @entity0 , said @entity80 , editor of @entity81 , a firm that analyzes digital media			1
information technology rules issued earlier this year allow officials to demand the removal of objectionable content			0
the difference with what @entity7 is proposing now , @entity80 said , is that service providers would have to censor content before it is even published			1
" absolutely , it 's censorship of free speech , " @entity80 said			2
" the fear i have is that this is the beginning of something bigger			0
" there are no exact numbers , but it 's estimated that as many as 100 million @entity0 are online			1
and that number is rapidly growing in a nation of 1.2 billion people			0
sites like @entity9 and @entity10 have gained popularity through their use on mobile phones			0
@entity80 said he suspects the @entity0 government got spooked by the use of social media this year to galvanize popular uprisings in the @entity108 , riots in the @entity110 and the anti-corruption movement at home			1
the @entity0 government , @entity80 said , is arming itself with the tools to stave off mass anti-government demonstrations			1
even more troubling is if the government tries to stifle political opposition by censoring online content , @entity80 said			0
increasingly , @entity0 political groups are using the @entity118 to generate support			2
" what i am worried about is the arbitrary decision taken to go down this path , " he said			0
" what is the government trying to hide ? why this cloak - and - dagger approach ? " meanwhile , tuesday evening , @entity10 was still buzzing in the world 's largest democracy			1
wrote r2the : " just ridiculous			0
what 's next ? they prevent thoughts from ever developing in our brains ? "			0
