@entity0 -- the fight over extending a payroll tax cut and long - term unemployment benefits resumes tuesday as @entity5 returns to work after its winter break			1
while aides in both parties say it 's likely @entity5 will resolve that dispute , @entity7 are still licking their wounds after a public backlash over how they handled those issues and fear that @entity15 will drag out the fight to score more political points in an election year			1
and @entity15 are concerned that @entity19 @entity7 will insist on adding more items to the measures to try to keep conservatives on board			2
according to a new @entity1 / @entity26 poll released monday , only 11 % of @entity24 approve of how @entity5 is handling its job			1
the previous all - time low approval rating for @entity5 was 14 % , set in august , at the very end of the debt ceiling debate which resulted in an unpopular agreement between the two parties			1
legislators returning on a cold and rainy tuesday morning were greeted by scores of sign - carrying protesters as part of an @entity5 rally			1
two demonstrators were detained , including one who was later charged with assaulting a police officer , according to @entity24 @entity42 sgt. @entity41			1
organizers of the protest said the day - long event will include teach - ins , a march and a pink slip -- a notice of termination -- for each member of @entity5			1
as the sun broke through in the early afternoon , the crowd had grown to several hundred protesters			1
inside the @entity56 , the presidential campaign will take center stage this year			2
president @entity58 already has made clear he plans to run against a " do - nothing " @entity5 and will likely highlight that theme during the annual @entity60 address next week			1
facing that high - profile push against them , and with the fight for control of both chambers in the balance , lawmakers know they have to do some heavy lifting to convince voters they deserve re-election			1
democrats , who run the @entity15 , and @entity7 , who control the @entity19 , acknowledge that outside of the payroll tax cut bill , no major legislation is expected to make it through @entity5 this year			1
however , each party promises a series of bills to advance what it thinks the public wants from @entity82 in response to the weak economy			2
for both sides , these efforts will be more about political messaging than actually legislating because few , if any , are likely to become law			2
congressional tensions this week , @entity90 will huddle at their annual three - day retreat in @entity92 to map out their 2012 agenda and strategy for responding to @entity58 and congressional @entity15			1
but high on the agenda at that meeting for @entity19 speaker @entity97 is likely to be an effort to bridge severe divisions with his own rank - and - file , many of whom questioned his leadership over the course of several showdowns with the @entity19 and @entity15 last year			1
conservatives want @entity97 to be more aggressive in standing for their principles			2
tensions between @entity15 and @entity7 are also high			2
the president 's decision earlier this month to make a recess appointment of @entity114 to head the @entity115 while @entity5 was technically not recessed drew a swift and angry response from @entity7			1
@entity118 aides privately grumbled the move set a bad tone for the coming year and invited @entity7 to be even less cooperative			0
and with key economic nominees needing @entity15 confirmation , including a new director of the @entity124 after @entity125 was named @entity19 chief of staff , @entity7 could cause problems for the president and @entity15 democrats			1
senate majority leader @entity130 said sunday on @entity132 's " @entity131 " that @entity5 spent months on issues unnecessarily last year , pointing out that president @entity134 raised the debt ceiling 18 times while in the @entity19			1
" we 've had obstructionism on steroids , " @entity130 said			0
a top @entity15 @entity141 leadership aide said the party is n't overly concerned			0
that 's because @entity15 believe @entity118 obstructionism is at such a high level now -- where filibusters are routine -- they already expect a major fight on every nominee			1
finishing the payroll tax cut bill when @entity5 limped out of town before @entity152 , it agreed to a two - month extension of a bill that cuts payroll taxes , extends unemployment benefits and prevents a cut in the rate paid to doctors who care for @entity161 patients			1
as they begin talks on an extension for the rest of 2012 , both sides remain highly skeptical and suspicious of each other			0
questions linger for congressional negotiators -- how to pay for the $ 200 billion price tag and whether to tighten requirements for unemployment benefits			1
@entity15 are worried @entity7 will push for other issues , such as renewing their demand for the approval of the controversial @entity175 oil pipeline or the elimination of a range of @entity179 regulations on businesses			0
some in the @entity118 are wary the @entity19 and @entity15 @entity15 will try again to pass a surtax on millionaires -- something even some @entity15 do n't support -- as a way of painting the @entity118 as protectors of the rich			0
" the only way this process will not go smoothly and through regular order is if the @entity19 chooses to disrupt it for political reasons , " said @entity97 spokesman @entity187			0
informal discussions between @entity19 and @entity15 negotiators have already begun			0
@entity130 told " @entity131 " that he hopes the @entity196 faction in the @entity19 does n't have the same influence on talks that it did in december 's impasse , calling that " bad for the country			2
" " i would hope the two @entity7 leaders would have learned from what took place in the previous year , " @entity130 said			0
debt ceiling again right out of the gate when @entity5 returns , lawmakers will have to respond formally to the president 's recent request to raise the debt ceiling			1
as part of the choreography agreed to last summer , members will get a chance to vote against the president 's request , but it 's mostly for show because the reality is @entity5 does n't have the votes to block an increase			1
two other significant bills need attention this winter			0
one is a new @entity224 bill that is stalled over disputes on labor rights and a costly government program to subsidize air travel to rural areas			0
senators also want to pass a highway bill that would fund road and bridge construction for the next two years			0
@entity58 is supposed to formally submit his budget for 2013 in february			0
last year , republicans criticized his budget for failing to reform entitlement programs like @entity161 and @entity238 , which represent the bulk of the nation 's massive budget deficit			2
" if he punts again , it will be clear the @entity19 plans to spend the year on autopilot			0
we think that would be unacceptable to the @entity24 people , " @entity97 's aide said			1
on the @entity175 matter , the administration already is facing a congressionally mandated deadline on february 21 to approve the project or explain why it wo n't			2
@entity15 say they expect the @entity19 to reject the plan , because the administration has said it ca n't finish its environmental review by then , but @entity7 are promising to continue to hammer the administration on the issue			0
bills to help the economy and send a message to voters in addition to their push for @entity175 , @entity19 @entity7 are planning votes early this year on legislation that would expand domestic energy production and upgrade transportation infrastructure across the country			0
the bill will include offshore drilling , energy exploration in the @entity271 ( @entity271 ) , as well as give money to states along with more flexibility to build roads and bridges			0
the new spending on highway projects would be offset by revenue from oil and gas leases			0
but the @entity19 is unlikely to support the @entity118 proposals and they are unlikely to go anywhere in the @entity141 - led @entity15			2
even without much hope for actually passing these bills , @entity19 @entity7 aides stress they will continue focusing on measures to boost the weak economy to show they are responding to voters ' concerns , and they emphasize that many of these proposals have had @entity141 support			0
" @entity297 is going to continue to work hard to produce results for small businesses , working families and middle - class @entity24 , " one @entity19 @entity118 aide told @entity1			1
" if the president wishes to ignore @entity5 and play political games , that 's his decision , but by doing so he will own the gridlock , " the aide said			1
in addition to the bills on jobs , the @entity19 also is expected to take up legislation to make more transparent members of @entity5 ' stock trades and other financial transactions			1
@entity118 leaders plan to vote on the so - called " @entity315 " which would ban lawmakers from using any non-public information to trade stocks or make other financial transactions			1
@entity15 want to draw a line to job creation with almost everything they do this year			2
that starts with the highway and @entity224 bills , which @entity15 say will create thousands of jobs			0
it will then continue all year with a myriad of bills @entity15 think will prove to a wary public they are putting jobs first			0
a measure to fund school construction is another example of a bill @entity15 hope to highlight			0
lawmakers from both parties say they are determined before the end of the year to prevent deep cuts to the defense budget as called for after the deficit reduction " super committee " failed to reach a deal to slash the deficit			0
aides said serious work to find alternative spending reductions probably wo n't happen until after the election in november			0
control of @entity5 as voters go to the polls this year , members are expected to spend less time in @entity0 and more time in their districts making the case for why their party ought to be steering the country 's economic agenda			1
@entity15 need to pick up 25 seats to regain control of the @entity19 -- a high hurdle , but one many democrats feel is within reach because they think voters will blame @entity7 for the gridlock in @entity0			0
@entity15 @entity7 feel more confident they can win control of their chamber , especially after the retirements of several key @entity141 senators in states that lean @entity7			0
right now , the @entity15 hold a 53 - 47 advantage			2
but @entity15 are defending 23 seats this year while republicans are working to hold just 10			0
the recent announcement by sen. @entity375 , a conservative @entity376 from @entity377 , that he would not seek re-election is seen by @entity7 as another sign @entity15 will lose majority control			0
