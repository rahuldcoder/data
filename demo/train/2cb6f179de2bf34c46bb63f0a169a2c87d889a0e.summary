@entity0 -- president @entity2 announced wednesday night that all the 33,000 additional @entity4 forces he ordered to @entity5 in december 2009 will be home within 15 months			1
in a nationally televised address from the @entity8 of the @entity9 , @entity2 said 10,000 of the " surge " forces would withdraw by the end of this year , and the other 23,000 would leave @entity5 by september 2012			1
@entity4 troop levels calling the deployment of the surge " one of the most difficult decisions that i 've made as president , " @entity2 said the military campaign was " meeting our goals " in @entity5 and the drawdown would begin " from a position of strength			1
" " @entity24 is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11 , " @entity2 said			2
" together with the @entity26 , we have taken out more than half of @entity24 's leadership			0
and thanks to our intelligence professionals and special forces , we killed @entity32 , the only leader that @entity24 had ever known			0
this was a victory for all who have served since 9/11			0
" at the same time , @entity2 said the @entity5 drawdown and the simultaneous winding down of the war in @entity40 would help the @entity4 begin to refocus attention and resources on efforts to resolve economic and other problems and to unify a politically divided nation			1
" @entity4 , it is time to focus on nation building here at home , " the president said			0
the troop withdrawals from @entity5 will begin next month , as @entity2 promised when he ordered the surge in a speech 18 months ago at the @entity54 at @entity55 , @entity56			1
after the departure of all the surge forces , the total @entity4 military deployment in @entity5 will be slightly fewer than 70,000 troops			1
@entity2 's time frame will give @entity4 commanders another two " fighting " seasons with the bulk of @entity4 forces still available for combat operations			1
it also will bring the surge troops home before the november 2012 election in which @entity2 will seek a second term			1
initial reaction was varied , with outgoing defense secretary @entity72 supporting @entity2 's decision while congressional leaders were divided between those who wanted a faster withdrawal and others calling for caution in leaving @entity5			1
" it 's important that we retain the flexibility necessary to reconsider troop levels and respond to changes in the security environment should circumstances on the ground warrant , " said @entity9 speaker @entity79 , @entity80 , in a statement			0
" it is my hope that the president will continue to listen to our commanders on the ground as we move forward			0
@entity95 will hold the administration accountable for ensuring that the pace and scope of the drawdown does not undermine the progress we 've made thus far			2
" sen. @entity102 , @entity103 , was more blunt , saying : " this is not the ' modest ' withdrawal that i and others had hoped for and advocated			0
" @entity108 colleagues of @entity2 expressed support for starting the withdrawal but said more troops should be included and they should depart faster than the president announced			1
" it has been the hope of many in @entity95 and across the country that the full drawdown of @entity4 forces would happen sooner than the president laid out -- and we will continue to press for a better outcome , " @entity9 minority leader @entity115 , @entity116 , said in a statement			2
trepidation about what 's next two candidates for the @entity128 presidential nomination to run against @entity2 next year expressed reservations about the withdrawal strategy , but differed in their reasoning			1
" we all want our troops to come home as soon as possible , but we should n't adhere to an arbitrary timetable on the withdrawal " from @entity5 , former @entity133 gov. @entity132 said in a statement			1
" this decision should not be based on politics or economics			0
" in his own statement , former @entity143 gov. @entity142 , who was @entity2 's ambassador to @entity144 until recently , called for shifting the @entity5 mission to " a focused counterterror effort which requires significantly fewer boots on the ground than the president discussed tonight			1
" " we need a safe but rapid withdrawal , which encourages @entity5 to assume responsibility , while leaving in place a strong counterintelligence and special forces effort proportionate to the threat , " @entity142 said			1
what happens to " civilian surge " as troops return home ? according to senior administration officials , the troop surge fulfilled a strategy to refocus the @entity4 war effort from @entity40 to @entity5			1
due to the surge , the officials told reporters , the military mission in @entity5 has made great progress toward its objectives of dismantling and defeating @entity24 in the region while stabilizing the country to prevent it from again providing a safe haven for the planning of terrorist attacks on the @entity4			1
the killing of @entity32 in early may and the success in reversing @entity180 momentum in the southern provinces of @entity182 and @entity183 enabled the beginning of a troop withdrawal that will culminate with handing over security responsibilities to @entity5 forces in 2014 , the senior administration officials said on condition of not being identified			1
in the speech , @entity2 announced that @entity190 will host a @entity192 summit in may 2012 to review the @entity5 mission and strategy going forward			1
gates -- along with @entity5 war commander gen. @entity196 -- had pushed for an initial drawdown of 3,000 to 5,000 troops this year , according to a congressional source			1
@entity72 also urged the president to withdraw support troops only -- not combat troops			0
@entity2 , however , ultimately decided to adopt the more aggressive withdrawal plan			2
the senior administration officials said @entity2 's withdrawal schedule fell within the range of options presented to him by @entity196			1
the general has been nominated to become @entity210 director to succeed @entity211 , who will take over as defense secretary when @entity72 steps down at the end of the month			0
in a statement after @entity2 's speech , @entity72 said it was " critical " that @entity4 forces continue to " aggressively " carry out the surge strategy of degrading the capability of the @entity180 while bolstering @entity5 security forces			1
" i support the president 's decision because it provides our commanders with enough resources , time and , perhaps most importantly , flexibility to bring the surge to a successful conclusion , " @entity72 said , signaling @entity222 control in deciding which @entity4 forces to withdraw			1
this week , @entity72 acknowledged that the president must take into account public opinion and congressional support for further military engagement			0
" sustainability here at home " is an important consideration , @entity72 said , noting that people are " tired of a decade of war			0
" @entity243 : the cost war in @entity5 public exhaustion with the conflict is reflected in recent public opinion polls			0
nearly three - quarters of @entity4 support the @entity4 pulling some or all of its forces from @entity5 , according to a june 3 - 7 @entity250 survey			0
that figure jumped 10 points since may , likely as a result of the death of @entity32 , pollsters said			0
republicans -- who have been the strongest supporters of the @entity4 military presence in @entity5 -- are shifting their opinion on the conflict			0
in may , 47 % of @entity128 said they favored a partial or full withdrawal of @entity4 troops			0
that figure rose to 60 % this month			0
the sharp divisions have been reflected in @entity95 , where @entity108 and @entity128 are increasingly split			0
sen. @entity263 , @entity264 , called tuesday for a " substantial and responsible reduction " in troop levels , arguing the war has become fiscally irresponsible and more resources need to be focused on domestic problems			0
the @entity4 has spent roughly $ 443 billion on the war in @entity5 , according to budget analysts			0
according to @entity273 , a researcher at the @entity274 , the troop reductions @entity2 announced would bring a savings of about $ 7 billion in fiscal year 2012			1
until wednesday , @entity2 had said publicly only that troops would begin coming home in july , and he recently indicated the initial number withdrawn would be " significant			2
" senior administration officials told @entity1 that planning for the announcement began in january , when the president summoned top members of his national security team into the @entity285 and tasked them with coming up with a plan for the drawdown			1
the calculations that went into the drawdown decision included the fact that " remarkable " and " unexpected " progress had been made degrading @entity24 's infrastructure in its bases in the tribal regions of @entity26 over the prior 18 months , one of the officials said			2
additionally , the @entity180 have been rolled back from their heartland regions in southern and southwestern @entity5 , both in northern and southern @entity182 and around the key city of @entity183 , which had been their de facto capital			0
this progress fulfilled the administration 's pledge to reverse the momentum of the @entity180 , which had been one of the key rationales for the surge			2
another factor favoring the drawdown was the growth in @entity5 army and police forces of 100,000 men in the past year , the officials said			1
the military progress has enabled some political progress , with @entity5 security forces preparing this year to take over seven areas in @entity5 that are home to some 20 % of the population			2
special forces operations against the @entity180 " middle management " in @entity5 have put significant pressure on them and have opened up more opportunities for " reconciliation " with the @entity180 , the officials said			2
a @entity9 official said the administration is " not starry eyed " about the prospects of discussions with the @entity180 and does not anticipate anything like " the @entity329 , " which ended @entity332 however , the official said , there are now between " 10 and 20 leads " that the @entity4 is aware of that may lead to substantive talks with the @entity180			0
the official said the leads are in the " exploratory " phase and that the @entity4 has briefed @entity5 president @entity340 about them			2
the deployment of @entity4 forces has n't been popular with many @entity5 leaders , who criticize the presence of the @entity4 in their country			0
it 's a message that 's not lost on @entity348 , the @entity4 ambassador to @entity5			2
" when we hear ourselves being called occupiers and worse , our pride is offended , and we begin to lose our inspiration to carry on , " @entity348 said sunday during a speech at @entity350 in western @entity5			2
" at the point your leaders believe that we are doing more harm than good , when we reach a point that we feel our soldiers and civilians are being asked to sacrifice without a just cause ... the @entity4 people will ask for our forces to come home			0
" @entity1 's @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 and @entity372 and @entity1 national security analyst @entity373 contributed to this report .			0
