thursday night 's final episode of " @entity2 " marked the end of 12 turbulent seasons , and the show immediately addressed the elephant in the room : would @entity8 return ? for the past four years , his character , @entity9 , has been dead as a doornail , but the finale showed us that @entity8 's " widow , " @entity13 , had been keeping him in a pit in her basement all this time			1
that is , until @entity8 escaped			1
as the hour unfolded , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) and @entity20 ( @entity21 ) discovered that @entity8 was alive and coming for them to get revenge			2
@entity13 ( @entity25 ) explained ( in a bizarre animated sequence ) that @entity8 's life had been saved at the last minute by a goat who jumped in front of the train meant for him , and she took him back to hold him hostage			2
seemingly every character in the show 's history -- and many exes , including one who was sleeping with @entity40 -- showed up as @entity18 and @entity20 tried to make amends on what they thought might be their last day alive			2
the pair tried to get help from a police detective played by @entity47 , who captured @entity8 ( though it turned out to be @entity49 he 'd caught )			2
the two even got a visit from @entity18 's son , @entity51 , now married and living in @entity52			0
@entity53 , who played @entity51 , denounced the show a few years ago before leaving but returned for the finale			0
with a minute remaining in the show , @entity18 and @entity20 spotted a helicopter in the distance , carrying a piano belonging to @entity8			1
from behind , we saw @entity8 come up to the front door , only to be crushed by the piano			0
cut to the show 's creator , @entity64 , saying " winning ! " ( @entity8 's catchphrase during his troubled times ) before he was crushed by a piano himself			1
it was a bizarre finale to say the least , almost reaching " @entity71 " proportions			0
the fourth wall was broken so many times , it was demolished			0
@entity64 anticipated that people would be disappointed by the lack of @entity8 and explained in his vanity card that the actor was offered the chance to appear in the final scene to deliver a few lines before being crushed by the piano but refused			0
@entity8 tweeted earlier that he was appearing on " @entity83 " but would never appear on " @entity2 " again			1
some fans were mightily disappointed , as the show had built up to an appearance by the character of @entity8 but failed to deliver			1
many said on @entity89 that the show was good up until that final scene , though others thought it lived up to its reputation .			0

the *series* ended after a turbulent 12 season run
fans hoped @entity8 would make an appearance
@entity8 tweeted he would never appear on the show again
