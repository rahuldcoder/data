that i want all of my children to have , including our son , who is gay , " said @entity3			1
will @entity3 told his father and mother he is gay two years ago , when he was a freshman at @entity44			2
" my son came to @entity46 , my wife , and i , told us that he was gay , and that it was not a choice , and that it 's just part of who he is , and that 's who he 'd been that way for as long as he could remember , " said @entity3			1
what was the @entity9 senator 's reaction ? " love			1
support , " responded @entity3			2
the president and the nation have evolved on same - sex marriage and complete surprise			1
he told @entity1 that he never suspected that his son was gay			2
@entity3 says his son , now a junior in college , helped him work through his decision to announce his change in position on gay marriage and blessed the idea of publicly announcing @entity72 's sexuality			1
" i think he 's happy and , you know , proud that we 've come to this point , but he let it be my decision just as you know , it 's going to be his decision as to the role he plays going forward in this whole issue , " said @entity3			2
until now , this was a secret to most people in politics , but not everyone			0
last year , when @entity5 was vetting @entity3 to be his running mate , the @entity12 @entity9 informed both @entity5 and his top campaign advisers that he has a gay son			1
activists hail watershed moment in the gay rights movement " i told @entity5 everything , " said @entity3 with a laugh			2
" that process is , intrusive would be one way to put it			0
but , no , yeah , i told him everything			0
" @entity3 , who was ultimately passed over as the @entity9 vice-presidential candidate in favor of rep. @entity100 , said the fact that his son is gay was not the deal breaker for @entity5			1
how does he know ? " well , because they told me , " said @entity3			2
@entity3 told @entity1 he sought counsel from a @entity9 who did serve as vice president : @entity107 , the highest - ranking @entity9 with an openly gay child , his daughter @entity109			1
5 turning points in gay marriage debate " i spoke to him personally ; i actually met with him , " said @entity3			1
he said @entity107 's advice was simple : " ' follow your heart			0
' " " he was a good person to talk to because he also was surprised by the news , in that case , you know , his wonderful daughter , who he loves very much			0
and it forced him to re-think the issue too , and over time , he changed his view on it , " said @entity3			2
" i followed his advice			0
you know , i followed my heart , " he said			0
though he is a staunch conservative , @entity3 was never outspoken against gay marriage			1
but he consistently voted against it			0
top @entity9 sign brief supporting same - sex marriage while in @entity134 , he supported a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage , voted for the @entity137 and voted for a bill prohibiting gay couples in @entity0 from adopting			1
in 2011 , 100 @entity141 law school graduates walked out of @entity3 's commencement address to protest his position on gay rights after circulating a petition trying to get him removed as the event 's speaker			2
" the decision to host a graduation speaker who is openly hostile to lgbt rights is deeply unfair to the @entity154 students who will be in the audience this year celebrating their graduation , " read the petition			0
@entity3 admitted that when the protest occurred , he already knew his own son was gay			1
" it was a little odd			0
look , and to be honest with you , it did n't affect that decision - making much , because it was , i did n't think it was appropriate , " @entity3 said			1
" but look , they had their freedom of speech rights to be able to do what they wanted to do			0
" will @entity3 ' especially proud ' of father " but you know , what happened to me is really personal			2
i mean , i had n't thought a lot about this issue			0
again , my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career , " said @entity3			2
asked about why he is announcing this change of heart , since his son revealed it to him two years ago , @entity3 cited two reasons			1
he just recently became comfortable with his decision to shift his position on gay marriage , and also he said he knew the @entity183 is considering a pair of gay marriage cases , and reporters would likely ask him for his position			1
" i thought it was the right time to let folks know where i stand so there 's no confusion , so i would be clear about it , " said @entity3			0
what would @entity3 say to gay constituents who may be glad he 's changing his position on gay marriage , but also wondering why it took having a gay son to come around to supporting their rights ? " well , i would say that , you know , i 've had a change of heart based on a personal experience			1
that 's certainly true , " he responded with a shoulder shrug			0
@entity206 on same - sex marriage : everyone is equal but he also repeated a reality			1
his policy focus has been almost exclusively on economic issues			0
" now it 's different , you know			0
i had n't expected to be in this position			0
but i do think , you know , having spent a lot of time thinking about it and working through this issue personally that , you know , this is where i am , for reasons that are consistent with my political philosophy , including family values , including being a conservative who believes the family is a building block of society , so i 'm comfortable there now			0
" to be sure , @entity3 was anything but comfortable discussing something as private and personal as his son 's sexuality , even noting how foreign it felt for someone with his @entity239 upbringing and sensibilities to talk publicly about such issues			2
at times , the press - savvy politician even seemed to tremble a bit			0
but it was also clear he was willing to endure the discussion in order to publicly tell his son that he is proud			0
" he wanted to tell us that there 's something about him that we did n't know , " @entity3 said , reflecting on the day two years ago his son will first told his parents he was gay			1
@entity3 quickly added that it " of course has n't changed our view of him at all			0
