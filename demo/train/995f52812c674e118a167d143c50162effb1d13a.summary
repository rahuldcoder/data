in one of the biggest such recalls ever , @entity0 has agreed to recall 3.7 million child car seats manufactured in recent years -- even as it officially contests a government request to recall nearly 1.8 million more -- over a buckling issue			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) announced tuesday that @entity0 is voluntarily recalling 11 of 18 model seats that the government agency had asked it to recall			1
" @entity6 's investigation will remain open pending its evaluation of the @entity0 recall and until the agency 's consideration of the review of the 7 remaining sea models is completed , " the department said			2
the 3.7 million seats alone makes this recall the fourth biggest ever for car seats , according to the federal agency			1
if all the seats the @entity6 was asking to @entity0 to recall are added in , it would be the biggest			2
in a statement , @entity0 said the voluntary recall affects " harness buckles used on all toddler convertible car seats and harnessed booster seats manufactured from 2009 to july 2013			1
" " this is not a new issue for us , " @entity0 spokeswoman @entity29 said , noting that all products sold since july do n't have the same problem			2
" we 've been working to help consumers for some time now			0
" at issue : the red release button in the center of the harness , which the @entity6 said can become difficult to unlatch , or can become stuck			0
that can make it difficult or impossible to remove the child quickly in an emergency			0
@entity0 explained that it found " that food and dried liquids can make some harness buckles progressively more difficult to open over time or become stuck in the latched position			1
" the children 's products company added that it was offering a " new and improved replacement harness buckle to affected customers at no cost			2
" people can obtain one by calling 800 - 345 - 4109 or emailing @entity55			0
until they get such a replacement , @entity0 believes that parents should continue using their seats for their children			0
" this does not , in any way , affect the performance of the car seat or the effectiveness of the buckle to restrain a child , " the company said			0
the @entity6 , meanwhile , said it " encourages parents and caregivers to consider acquiring an alternative car seat for transporting children until their @entity0 seat is fixed			0
" @entity0 reports no injuries associated with this issue on seats , which sold for between $ 99 and $ 400			0
according to @entity0 's website , the recall models include these toddler convertible car seats : the @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 50 , my ride 65 , my ride 65 with @entity85 , my ride 70 , @entity87 70 , my size 70 , @entity89 70 and @entity90			1

according to the government , the seven models that @entity0 is n't recalling despite being asked to do so by the @entity6 are all infant seats			1
specifically , they are : @entity101 , @entity102 30 , @entity102 32 , @entity103 , @entity102 35 , @entity104 35 , and @entity105 40			0
asked about these models , @entity0 's spokeswoman said that any customers with those or other car seats can still call and get a new harness buckle sent to them for free			1
" they are not officially recalled ; however , customers experiencing any difficulty with their harness buckle can still get a new one , " said @entity29 .			0
