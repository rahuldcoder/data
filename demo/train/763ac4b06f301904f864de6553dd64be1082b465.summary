@entity14 personnel could hear gunfire and blasts throughout the day			0
heavy smoke billowed above the airport			1
while the government issued a statement calling for calm , @entity2 's government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces			0
many of the armed groups are on the state 's payroll			0
these circumstances make it very difficult for the government to gain control over this latest increasingly volatile and violent situation			0
state - run @entity32 television gave the death toll , citing @entity2 's @entity34			0
brigades from the @entity37 militia have controlled the airport since the @entity2 civil war in 2011			1

armed militias are now the biggest challenge			0
