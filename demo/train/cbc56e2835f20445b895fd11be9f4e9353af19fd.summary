-- two former top leaders in @entity3 's notorious @entity2 , which ruled the @entity5 country between 1975 and 1979 , were found guilty of crimes against humanity by a specially - convened @entity3 court thursday			1
before the verdict , only one person had been brought to justice over one of the 20th century 's great atrocities			1
@entity14 , the former deputy secretary of the @entity16 , and @entity17 , the one - time president of @entity18 both received life sentences			1
@entity14 , 88 , known as " brother @entity14 , " and @entity17 , 83 , known as " brother @entity21 , " were expressionless as the verdict was read			1
they were found guilty of the following : crimes against humanity , of extermination , murder , political persecution , and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer , forced disappearances and attacks against human dignity committed within the territory of @entity3 between 17 april 1975 and december 1977			1
" the chamber finds that as a consequence of the crimes of which the accused have been convicted , the civil parties and a very large number of additional victims have suffered immeasurable harm , including physical suffering , economic loss , loss of dignity , psychological trauma , and grief arising from the loss of family members and close relations , " a judge said in the ruling			0
the men were taken into custody after their arrest in 2007			0
the defendants can appeal the judgment , and @entity59 , part of @entity14 's defense team , indicated that they would be seeking to exercise that right			1
the defense team for @entity17 also said they would appeal the verdict			2
the charges were heard in @entity66 in the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) -- a special @entity69 - backed tribunal that was formed in 2006 to prosecute senior @entity2 leaders and other regime figures responsible for especially heinous acts			1
@entity73 welcomed the result as an important step towards justice			0
" this long - awaited ruling is an important step towards justice for the victims of the @entity2 period and highlights the importance of addressing impunity , " said the organization 's deputy asia - pacific director @entity77			1
" but the earlier refusal of senior @entity3 government officials to give evidence , as well as allegations of political interference in other @entity67 cases , is troubling and raises concerns around the fairness of the proceedings and respect for victims ' right to hear the full truth regarding the alleged crimes			1
" @entity73 also welcomed the court 's decision to endorse 11 reparation projects for victims			0
" however , much more must also be done by the government of @entity3 towards repairing the harm suffered by victims			2
" a timeline of the @entity2 regime and its aftermath a bloody regime the two men were senior leaders in the @entity2 regime , which ruled @entity3 between 1975 and 1979			1
during that time at least 1.7 million people -- about a quarter of the @entity3 population -- are believed to have died from forced labor , starvation and execution , as the movement ruthlessly executed its radical social engineering policies aimed at creating a purely agrarian society			2
an ongoing struggle for justice after @entity2 the pair were tried in a " hybrid " tribunal -- officially " an ad hoc @entity3 court with international participation " -- uses both @entity3 and international judges and staff employed by the @entity69 in order to ensure the trials are conducted to international standards and to mitigate against the weakness of the @entity3 legal system			1
" this judgment represents an important milestone for @entity3 and victims around the world , " a joint statement from the office of the co-prosecutors read			2
" for 35 years ( the leaders of the regime ) evaded justice for some of some of the most brutal and cruel crimes ever committed			1
" around 3,500 victims participated in the trial , as witnesses giving evidence , observers and in seeking reparations			0
" the trial has allowed @entity3 to reset its moral compass , which was destroyed by the accused 40 years ago , " the statement said			2
until today 's conclusion , the @entity67 had delivered only one verdict in its eight years of existence			0
in the @entity67 's @entity162 , @entity160 , commonly known by his alias , @entity160 , was sentenced to life imprisonment following his 2010 convictions for war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture			1
he was the commandant of the notorious @entity170 in @entity66 , where more than 14,000 people died			0
the verdicts on thursday in the case known as 002/01 was the first time that senior leaders of the regime have faced justice			1
recognizing the limitations of the court , the @entity67 's legal communications officer @entity178 told @entity0 : " we ca n't prosecute everyone who committed a crime 35 years ago			0
that 's the nature of international justice			2
" disappointment some victims of the crimes of the regime were not satisfied by the verdict			2
@entity190 , founding president of the @entity191 , told @entity0 that the scope of the @entity193 , and the trial , by focusing on the forced movements , and the murder of 250 @entity197 ( the previous prime minister ) officials and troops at @entity201 shortly after the regime was installed was insufficient			0
" @entity3 has n't got to the heart of the genocide			2
" it 's a missed opportunity ... it completely missed the mark			0
what have we seen from $ 200 million and eight years ( of the existence of the @entity67 ) ? ( it is ) really a disservice to the other @entity3 victims			0
" she did allow that the trial was the " beginning of a process of healing " and that it would " serve as a catalyst for conversations in @entity3 about our past			0
" @entity220 was just seven years old in 1978 when both her parents were killed after several months in prison			0
it was at a time when the leadership was , she said , in " extreme paranoia " and even party cadres were being purged			0
her mother was taken from the cell she shared with her children and other families , and " tiptoed to her death " to avoid waking up @entity220 and her younger brother			0
" the tragedy of my story is that it 's so common , " she said			0
