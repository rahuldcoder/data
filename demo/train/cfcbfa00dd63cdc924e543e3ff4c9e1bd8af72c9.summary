-- deaths from pregnancy and childbirth in the @entity4 have doubled in the past 20 years , a development that a human rights group called " scandalous and disgraceful " friday			1
in addition , the rights group said , about 1.7 million women a year , one - third of pregnant women in the @entity4 , suffer from pregnancy - related complications			1
most of the deaths and complications occur among minorities and women living in poverty , it noted			2
@entity19 issued a report friday that calls on president @entity21 to take action			1
" this country 's extraordinary record of medical advancement makes its haphazard approach to maternal care all the more scandalous and disgraceful , " said @entity28 , executive director of @entity29			1
" good maternal care should not be considered a luxury available only to those who can access the best hospitals and the best doctors			1
women should not die in the richest country on earth from preventable complications and emergencies , " @entity28 said in a news release			2
the report , " @entity42 : the @entity47 in the @entity4 , " notes that the lifetime risk of maternal deaths is greater in the @entity4 than in 40 other countries , including virtually all industrialized nations			1
the report also noted that severe pregnancy - related complications that nearly cause death -- known as " near misses " -- have increased by 25 percent since 1998			2
up to 40 percent of near misses are considered preventable with better quality of care , according to a 2007 study in the @entity57			2
minorities , women living in poverty , @entity60 , immigrants and those who speak little or no @entity62 are particularly affected , @entity19 said			1
" the thing that really struck us was that these problems hit women of color , low - income , particularly hard , " said @entity64 , researcher and co-author of the @entity29 report			1
" but every woman who is going through pregnancy in this country is at risk			0
" figures compiled by the @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80 , show that black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts			1
white women have a mortality rate of 9.5 per 100,000 pregnancies , the @entity78 said			1
for @entity91 - @entity91 women , that rate is 32.7 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies			1
" this has been known for a while and no one has a good handle on it , " said dr. @entity94 , chairman and chief of obstetrics at @entity97 in @entity98			0
" this is a national disgrace and a call to action			0
both numbers are a call to action -- maternal mortality and racial disparity			2
" the @entity78 analysis shows that deaths during pregnancy and childbirth have doubled for all @entity4 women in the past 20 years			1
in 1987 , there were 6.6 deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies			1
the number of deaths had climbed to 13.3 per 100,000 in 2006 , the last year for which figures were available			2
a report called " @entity123 " by the @entity124 says that number should be around four deaths for each 100,000 pregnancies			1
statistics for other highly industrialized countries show that the @entity4 goal of four deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies is attainable			1
@entity131 , for example , has fewer than four deaths for each 100,000 pregnancies , @entity94 said			1
" women 's health is at risk , " said @entity132			0
" we spend the most , and yet women are more likely to die than in 40 other countries			1
and that disconnect is what makes it such a problem			0
" @entity19 points out that nearly 13 million @entity4 women of reproductive age ( 15 to 44 years old ) , or one in five , do not have health insurance			1
minorities account for 32 percent of all women in the @entity4 but 51 percent of uninsured women , the rights group said			1
furthermore , @entity19 said , one in four women do not receive adequate prenatal care , starting in the first trimester			1
the number rises to about one in three for @entity91 and @entity60 women , the human rights group said			0
@entity19 also cited what it called " burdensome bureaucratic procedures in medicaid enrollment [ that ] substantially delay access to vital prenatal care for pregnant women seeking government - funded care			1
" in addition , the group said , a shortage of health care professionals poses a serious obstacle to timely and adequate care , especially in rural areas and inner cities			0
in 2008 , 64 million people were living in " shortage areas " for primary care , @entity19 said			2
" obstacles to care are widespread , even though the @entity29 spends more on health care than any other country and more on pregnancy and childbirth - related hospital costs , $ 86 billion , than any other type of hospital care , " the rights group said			2
in its call for @entity21 to take action , @entity19 said a health care reform proposal before @entity184 does not address the issue			2
" reform is primarily focused on health care coverage and reducing health care costs , and even optimistic estimates predict that any proposal on the table will still leave millions without access to affordable care , " said @entity186 , one of the authors of the " @entity42 " report			2
" mothers die not because the @entity4 ca n't provide good care , but because it lacks the political will to make sure good care is available to all women , " said @entity28 , @entity29 's executive director			1
medical professionals and researchers note that although the percentage of maternal deaths is increasing , the overall number still remains low			0
" they are low in absolute number sense , " said @entity94 in @entity98			0
" these are rare events			0
they serve as a canary in the mine shaft -- tell us that we need to look more carefully at the system of maternity care			0
overall , childbirth is very safe			0
" more of an alarm is not sounded , analysts said , because most practitioners do n't see many -- if any -- deaths each year			0
there is now approximately one death for every 6,000 to 10,000 births , @entity94 said			0
a typical hospital has about 1,500 births a year , so any hospital can go years without a maternal death , he said			0
" it 's still , thank heavens , quite rare , " said @entity228 , executive director of @entity229			0
but that does n't mean there 's not a problem , she said			0
" when you see trends worsen in such a short period of time , it requires thoughtful examination , " said @entity235			0
" and you ca n't just dismiss that			0
" @entity244 , director of strategic initiatives at the @entity246 , also believes something should be done			0
" it 's unacceptable in a resource - rich country like the @entity4 that we are seeing maternal - and pregnancy - related deaths trending upward , " she said			2
" we have to look very , very carefully at this			0
" @entity0 's @entity254 contributed to this report .			0

@entity19 report calls for better maternal care in @entity4
" women are more likely to die than in 40 other countries , " @entity29 says
