-- since 9/11 , the @entity1 has increasingly relied on drones to kill its enemies and to chip away at terrorism around the globe			1
drone warfare has always been controversial			0
but it became virtually sensational during the heated discussion over @entity10 's nomination to be @entity12 chief			0
responding to a question stemming from that discussion , attorney general @entity13 said this week that he would n't rule out the possibility of a drone strike against @entity1 on @entity1 soil			1
but he said the administration was n't planning on such a strike and would use the option only under extreme circumstances			0
@entity13 futher clarified the administration 's stance thursday with a brief letter to sen. @entity26 , @entity27 , who had staged a 13 - hour filibuster of @entity10 's confirmation			1
" it has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question : ' does the president have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an @entity1 not engaged in combat on @entity1 soil ? ' " @entity13 wrote			1
" the answer to that question is no. " a to z : the drone program that satisfied @entity26 , who had ended his filibuster and allowed @entity10 's confirmation to go on			2
but it has n't ended the discussion about the use of drones over the @entity1			2
what 's president @entity50 's argument ? for some time , the administration has fervently defended the drone program in general , boasting that it has helped decimate @entity53 and saved the lives of troops that might otherwise be involved in ground attacks			1
the @entity1 has carried out 349 " @entity12 drone strikes " in @entity60 and 61 in @entity61 , according to @entity58 - based nonpartisan think tank @entity57			1
when it comes to drone strikes in @entity65 or @entity66 , the administration insists the unmanned machines could be used when an imminent threat to the @entity1 is clear			1
drone strikes on @entity1 soil could be necessary when capture is n't feasible , the administration says			1
dealing with a 9/11 or a @entity74 - style attack -- or one that seems very likely -- could justify a domestic drone strike , @entity13 said			2
what law or precedent might support their argument ? @entity0 legal analyst @entity81 said there is no law on drone strikes			1
" police officers use weapons on @entity1 citizens all the time , " he said			1
" this is just another weapon			0
" the @entity89 has held that the military may constitutionally use force against a @entity1 citizen who is a part of enemy forces			2
but that 's not in the @entity1			1
again , there is other documentation about drone use against @entity1 citizens abroad			1
consider a @entity101 memo , given to select members of @entity103 last year , that says the @entity1 government can use lethal force against @entity1 citizens overseas who are operational leaders of @entity53 or its affiliates			1
one high - profile example of a @entity1 citizen killed in a strike overseas is @entity110 , a radical cleric born and educated in the @entity1			2
a drone killed him in @entity61 in 2011			0
who are the most vocal opponents ? the pushback against the administration has united unlikely bedfellows			1
republicans and @entity118 are both dubious of drones hovering over @entity1			1
but while @entity26 stopped the @entity122 's work cold to express his displeasure , the @entity120 is n't standing as one over anti-terrorism tactics			0
sens. @entity126 and @entity127 assailed @entity26 's filibuster			0
" all i can say is that i do n't think that what happened yesterday is helpful to the @entity1 people , " @entity126 , @entity129 , said on the @entity122 floor thursday			2
at one point in his filibuster , @entity26 said there would be nothing stopping the @entity1 from dropping a missile on @entity138 , who actively protested the @entity139 in the 1970s			2
@entity126 , who admitted that @entity138 was n't his " favorite @entity1 , " was peeved by @entity26 's argument			1
" somehow to allege that the @entity1 -- our government -- will drop a drone hellfire missile on @entity138 , that brings the conversation from a serious discussion about @entity1 policy to the realm of the ridiculous , " he sniped			1
an @entity150 lawyer called @entity50 the " judge , jury and executioner " in the matter , and said he agreed with @entity151			2
what are the political overtones here ? the debate , in a larger way , is about the struggle between the executive and legislative branches and which wields authority in such matters			0
there are also questions about how the issue might affect the next presidential election , when @entity50 's two terms will be up			0
@entity26 has hinted that he may run in 2016			0
the next president will probably , at least until challenged , assume the same authority @entity50 has regarding drone strikes			0
but @entity174 with the @entity175 , an expert on drones and terrorism , cautions against too many predictions			0
" this is such a fast - moving issue , and many parts are still being decided , " he said			0
" but i would add that if you look at how the topic played out in the last election , there was one question on drones in the third debate , and both candidates thought about it for 10 seconds and agreed they were great , " he said			0
" maybe next time , it will take 20 seconds before they say that			0
" what 's the larger issue at stake ? drones are becoming more common in general , and technology can not be stopped , experts say			0
controlling the technology and its capabilities will be incredibly difficult			0
so that will make the idea of transparency even more important			0
there has been " a means of dealing with imminent threat in this country -- it 's the police , a time - honored way of dealing with the guy who comes into @entity103 with a grenade launcher , " said @entity214 , an @entity215 writer who has written about @entity50 and the drone program			1
" we would n't be talking about this if we did n't suddenly have this technology ability of taking out anybody we wish			0
" it 's the technology that has extended the arm of the law and executive attention			2
" the question for @entity1 is how far they want the president 's arm to reach .			2

what is the administration 's argument for targeting @entity1 citizens on @entity1 soil ?
there is no drone law , or precedent , @entity0 legal analyst says
debate has united strange bedfellows -- *democrats* , republicans , @entity150
