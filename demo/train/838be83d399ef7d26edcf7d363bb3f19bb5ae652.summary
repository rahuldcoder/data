@entity0 -- after progress earlier this week in fiscal cliff negotiations , president @entity2 and @entity4 speaker @entity3 butted heads wednesday , setting the stage for a showdown as the deadline looms for an agreement			1
the negotiations had focused on a $ 2 trillion package of new revenue , spending cuts and entitlement changes the two sides have shaped into a broad deficit reduction plan			0
@entity3 on tuesday proposed a " plan b , " which would extend @entity21 - era tax cuts on income of up to $ 1 million			1
he described it as a fallback option to prevent a sweeping tax hike while negotiations continue on a broader plan			2
but the @entity4 on wednesday threatened to veto " plan b , " saying it would bring only " minimal " changes in projected budget deficits			2
@entity2 told reporters earlier in the day that @entity32 were focused too much on besting him personally rather than thinking about what 's best for the country			1
" take the deal , " @entity2 said to @entity32 , referring to the broader proposal , adding that it would " reduce the deficit more than any other deficit reduction package " and would represent an achievement			2
" they should be proud of it , " @entity2 said			0
" but they keep on finding ways to say ' no ' as opposed to finding ways to say ' yes			0
' " his comments at a @entity4 news conference came less than two weeks before the end of the year , when the nation 's taxpayers would face automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts if no agreement is reached			1
economists say that failure to reach agreement could spark another recession			0
@entity3 issued his own statement wednesday , saying the president had yet to make a proposal offering a balance between increased revenue and spending cuts			2
in a 52 - second appearance before reporters , @entity3 said the @entity4 will pass his fallback plan thursday limiting tax increases to income above $ 1 million			1
while the plan represents a concession from @entity3 's original vow to oppose any tax - rate increase , it sets a higher threshold than the $ 400,000 sought by @entity2			1
once the @entity4 passes his plan , the president can either persuade @entity77 to accept it or " be responsible for the largest tax increase in @entity80 history , " @entity3 said before walking off without answering shouted questions			1
the @entity2 administration and congressional @entity77 said @entity3 changed course because he was unable to muster @entity32 support for the larger deal being negotiated with @entity2			1
at his news conference , @entity2 alluded to last friday 's @entity88 school shootings in calling on republicans to put aside political brinksmanship			2
" if there 's one thing we should have after this week , it should be perspective about what 's important , " he said			0
" right now , what the country needs is for us to compromise , " he continued			0
he characterized as " puzzling " the @entity32 refusal to accept his compromise			0
asked why an agreement was proving so elusive after both sides had made concessions , @entity2 said it might be that " it is very hard for them to say ' yes ' to me			0
" " at some point they 've got to take me out of it , " @entity2 said of republicans , adding they should instead focus on " doing something good for the country			2
" @entity3 responded by arguing that @entity2 's proposal was not evenly balanced , with more new revenue instead of the spending cuts and entitlement reforms @entity32 seek			1
the @entity3 plan b would leave intact government spending cuts , including those related to defense , which are required under a budget deal reached last year to raise the federal debt ceiling			1
the threat of cuts was intended to motivate @entity123 to reach a deal			0
opinion : art that calls the fiscal cliff 's bluff but @entity2 said wednesday that @entity3 's proposal " defies logic " because it raises tax rates on some @entity80 , which @entity32 say they do not want , and contains no spending cuts , which @entity32 say they do want			1
he also criticized the measure as a benefit for wealthy @entity80 , who would have lower tax rates on income up to $ 1 million			0
the @entity4 and congressional @entity77 say plan b has no chance of passing ; @entity2 said that bringing it up only wastes time			1
senior administration officials said @entity2 and @entity3 have not spoken to each other since monday			2
@entity32 leaders planned to vote thursday on @entity3 's proposal , as well as @entity2 's long - standing proposal to return to higher tax rates of the 1990s on income above $ 250,000 for families			1
@entity2 on monday raised the threshold for the higher tax rates to $ 400,000			0
conservative allies publicly supported @entity3 's plan wednesday			1
anti-tax crusader @entity151 provided political cover for republicans who have signed his pledge against tax increases , saying he could support plan @entity157 @entity2 and @entity77 argue that increased revenue , including higher tax rates on the wealthy , must be part of broader deficit reduction plan			1
@entity2 made the tax proposal a theme of his re-election campaign , arguing that it would prevent a tax increase for middle - class @entity80			0
polls show support for the @entity2 plan , and some @entity32 have called for acceding to the president on the tax issue in order to focus on cuts to spending and entitlement programs			1
budget experts : fiscal cliff deal could disappoint @entity3 and @entity32 initially opposed any rise in tax rates but agreed to raising revenue by eliminating some deductions and loopholes			2
the offer of a plan with higher rates for millionaires represented a further concession , but @entity2 and @entity77 say it would not suffice			0
senate majority leader @entity189 of @entity190 said @entity3 's plan appeared to be a result of pressure from tea party conservatives opposing a wider deal			1
" it would be a shame if @entity32 abandoned productive negotiations due to pressure from the tea party , as they have time and again , " @entity189 said this week			0
@entity3 's spokesman , @entity202 , shot back that the plan b proposal gave @entity77 what they wanted -- higher tax rates on millionaires			1
what happens if the payroll tax cut expires @entity2 's latest offer has generated protests from the liberal base of the @entity213 because it includes cuts in entitlement programs such as @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			2
@entity219 , executive director of @entity220 , which backed @entity2 's presidential campaigns , said its members would consider any benefit cuts " a betrayal that sells out working and middle - class families			0
" in particular , liberals cited concessions that @entity2 made monday in his counteroffer , including a new inflation formula applied to benefits called chained @entity232			0
@entity2 offers fiscal cliff tax concession chained @entity232 includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years			0
statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean @entity216 recipients would get $ 6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained @entity232			0
but @entity4 spokesman @entity245 said @entity2 's @entity232 proposal " would protect vulnerable communities , including the very elderly , when it comes to @entity216 recipients			1
" he called the president 's acceptance of the chained @entity232 a signal of his willingness to compromise			0
@entity1 's @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .			0
