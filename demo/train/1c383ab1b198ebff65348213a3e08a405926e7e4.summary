after months of anticipation , a grand jury 's decision on whether to indict a @entity3 officer for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager could come at any moment			1
and when it does , anything could happen in the tinderbox that is @entity10 , @entity3			0
but how did we get to this point ? here are six things to know to get up to speed on the case : on august 9 , 18 - year - old @entity15 and his friend @entity16 were walking in the middle of a residential street when a white officer , @entity19 , pulled up and told them to get out of the road			1
that 's where the stories quickly diverge			0
according to @entity16 , he and @entity15 told the officer they were almost at their destination and would be out of the street shortly			1
but @entity16 said the officer grabbed @entity15 by the neck and drew his gun , eventually shooting @entity15			1
" at no point in time did they struggle over the weapon because the weapon was already drawn on us , " @entity16 said			0
by contrast , a @entity19 family friend identified as " @entity40 " told local radio station @entity41 that @entity15 started a physical altercation with the officer			1
" @entity15 just bum rushes him , and just shoves him back into his car , punches him in the face and then of course @entity19 grabs for his gun and @entity15 grabs the gun , " @entity40 said			1
" at one point he 's got the gun totally turned against his hip , and then he shoves it away and the gun goes off			0
" a source told @entity6 that @entity40 's account matches what the officer told investigators			2
both sides agree that @entity15 ran and then turned back -- the question is whether he turned to attack or surrender			2
" he was running for his life and just got shot and turned around and did n't try to reach for anything , " witness @entity62 said			2
" he put his hands in the air being compliant , and he still got shot down like a dog			0
" @entity40 gives a different explanation			0
" all of a sudden ( @entity15 ) just started to bum rush him			1
he just started coming at him full speed so ( @entity19 ) just started shooting and he just kept coming , " @entity40 said			1
" the final shot was in the forehead and then he fell about 2 , 3 feet in front of the officer			2
" the official autopsy , as published by the @entity75 , said @entity15 suffered six gunshot entrance wounds			2
the wounds included a shot to the hand at close range , according to an autopsy analysis reported by the @entity75			0
that detail could support @entity19 's claim of a struggle inside his patrol car			2
but that does n't explain why @entity19 continued shooting , including at least one shot to @entity15 's head			1
a private autopsy conducted for the @entity15 family showed the teen had been shot at least six times , including twice in the head			1
the grand jury is deciding whether @entity19 should be charged with any one of several possible crimes			1
those possible charges include first - degree murder , second - degree murder , voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter , said @entity101 , spokesman for the prosecuting attorney 's office			0
the grand jury can issue an indictment on any of those four charges , and it also has the option of adding a charge of armed criminal action , authorities said			1
at the same time , the grand jury will consider @entity3 's statutes for self - defense and police use of deadly force			1
different states have different numbers , but there are 12 members on the @entity3 grand jury			1
nine of the 12 must vote yes to indict someone on a charge			0
the grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret			1
the grand jurors ' races and ethnicities are also kept under wraps			0
though the grand jury has until january to issue its ruling , the prosecutor 's office has said a decision could come in mid-november			1
complete coverage of the events in @entity10 who knows			0
for more than 70 days and nights , protesters have demanded an indictment for @entity19 and have called for @entity10 police chief @entity141 to resign			2
only on a few nights has the situation turned violent , with some protesters hurling bottles or rocks at officers while police , dressed in riot gear , threw tear gas canisters			0
gov. @entity151 made clear he 's not anticipating violence but wants to be ready for anything			0
police from various departments will operate as a unified command			0
the @entity157 will be available as necessary			0
law enforcement is prepared to extend shifts and limit leave , and additional resources have been distributed , @entity151 said			0
but one protester predicts violence if @entity19 is n't indicted : " if there is not an indictment , excuse my @entity167 , all hell is going to break loose			2
" @entity6 's @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report .			0

a grand jury could decide at any moment whether to indict officer @entity19
@entity19 fatally shot @entity15 , an unarmed @entity178 - @entity177 teen
the officer said @entity15 started a physical *confrontation*
autopsies reveal @entity15 was shot at least six times
