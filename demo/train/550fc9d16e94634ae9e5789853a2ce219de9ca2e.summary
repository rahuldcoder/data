-- there 's probably a belt in this guy 's future			2
after much discussion and online gnashing of teeth about the disheveled pitchman for travel company @entity11 , the @entity6 - based company has heeded the call for a @entity14 makeover			1
you know the guy : rumpled shirt , five o'clock shadow , tousled hair and no belt ( why no belt ? many have pondered )			2
there 's a contest under way to find a new outfit for @entity27 actor and musician @entity28 , aka the @entity14			1
the winner will receive a five - day getaway to @entity31 , @entity6 , to see the filming of a new commercial featuring a spiffed - up @entity28			1
just post a photo of an outfit from your closet or a store on the @entity40 contest page or via @entity41 or @entity42 using @entity43 by august 24 to be considered			2
feel free to model the outfit yourself			2
voting for the winning look begins august 28 on @entity40			0
but does @entity28 , 48 , feel like he needs a makeover ? " why not ? i think it 's fun , and i would definitely like to have somebody else 's opinion on my outfits			1
and why not let the @entity27 public choose ? " @entity28 said			1
" do i need a makeover ? no. do i want one ? kind of , yeah			1
" what he does n't want , though , is to look like every other slick tv pitchman			0
@entity28 ' original @entity11 look is the work of a @entity60 stylist			1
he tried on a number of outfits and @entity63 made the final call			0
" i had a belt on at one point , and it just did n't kind of go with the outfit and we scrapped the belt			2
it 's probably one of the best decisions we ever came up with because look what it 's created , " @entity28 said			1
what it 's created , among @entity27 fans and critics , is much speculation about this mystery man			0
did he just roll in on a red - eye or out of bed or off a bender ? hard to say			0
and that , it seems , is what has people fascinated			0
" it 's that ' divorcee who keeps scotch in the glovebox ' look , " according to one @entity41 user who replicated the distinctive look for himself			0
" i 've decided the â € ª # @entity93 is what happened when the â € ª # @entity96 guy lost his wife and started smoking lots of pot , " said another			0
the real guy is based in @entity31 , where he recently finished a two - and - a - half year stint playing an @entity27 rock star on @entity6 soap opera " @entity103 " ( " good times , bad times " )			0
that role is actually the reason for the semi-shaven , tousled coiffure of the @entity11 ad			1
on the show he had longer hair and a goatee , so he had to retain some of that to be ready for his rock star role , complete with goatee , a week after shooting the ad			0
@entity28 had an early acting role on the " @entity119 " and he has also appeared on " @entity122 " and on @entity121 stages			1
he has released an ep called " @entity124 , " and is an avid wearer of belts			0
and for those fans who find his rough - and - tumble trivago look rather fetching , you 'll be pleased to know that @entity28 is single " and loving it			2

a makeover contest aims to spiff up the disheveled " @entity14 "
@entity28 , the actor who stars in @entity11 commercials , is open to *improvements*
" do i need a makeover ? no. do i want one ? kind of , yeah "
