in an interview with @entity17 's @entity40 , @entity8 described the accident			1
she checked on the propane grill on a chilly night and discovered the flame had been blown out			1
" the cover of the grill was open so i assumed ... that there would n't be any gas in the air			1
well , propane is actually heavier than air and especially in cold weather it tends to sit on top of the grill , pool inside , " she said			1
" so the second i relit the flame -- after i turned the gas off ... it was a wall of fire , a huge explosion			2
so much force that it blew the doors of the grill completely off			2
" a neighbor clear across the street had thought a tree had fallen through his roof , that 's how loud the explosion was , and it happened in a split second , " she said			0
" and immediately i was on fire , so my hair was on fire , my chest and the whole top of my shirt was on fire			0
i did n't know what to do other than -- i 'm left handed -- reach and just get the shirt off of me as quickly as possible			0
" i yelled inside to my 15 - year - old daughter who was in the kitchen , ' @entity80 's on fire ! you have to call 911 ! ' " @entity8 said , becoming choked up			1

at one point during the parade broadcast , @entity8 added a personal note as a float honoring the parade 's president -- a nurse -- passed by			1
" thanks to all the great nurses at @entity96 " who have " been to my house every day for the last couple of weeks helping me be here today , " storm said			2
