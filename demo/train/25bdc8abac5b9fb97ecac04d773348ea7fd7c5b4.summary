there 's going to be a lot of angry reality tv show participants			0
" -- @entity57 , co-founder of cloth 2 ) " a siri that actually works			0
as a human society , we 're not ready yet for an intelligent being that lives inside our phones			1
sure , @entity59 can fetch you the weather and add appointments to your calendar , but it ca n't communicate with another @entity59 and find the best time for that conference call			1
there is n't real artificial intelligence that lives and breathes inside our phones yet			0
@entity59 , and @entity73 and other apps can synthesize and retrieve data , but ultimately they can not decide for us			1

" -- @entity81 , ceo & co-founder of @entity84 4 ) " i am glad that the automatic , pervasive check - in has n't yet become a reality			1
you can see the beginnings of it with @entity91 's auto - stamp of where you are when you open the app ( unless you disable it , which most seem to do ) , but it is n't part of mainstream social media platforms like @entity98 and foursquare			1
" -- @entity99 , president , chief operating officer & co-founder of @entity103 5 ) " @entity104 - enabled vanity mirror			0
" -- @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 at @entity109 6 ) " @entity110 going @entity111 and showing me ads based on what i 'm tweeting about			1

@entity109 originally promised that it would ship beta versions to developers at the end of 2012 , but as of nov. 26 , those who pre-ordered are still waiting			1
while @entity119 sounds super-cool on the surface , the idea is also kind of creepy			2
