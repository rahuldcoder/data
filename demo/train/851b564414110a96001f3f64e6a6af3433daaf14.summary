-- these past six weeks , we 've been thinking a lot about the ocean			1
but there 's a deeper story than this one oil spill			1
unfortunately the @entity8 disaster is a pretty typical example of the way we think about the ocean : we just do n't worry about stuff that happens out there			1
the ocean covers 71 percent of the @entity14 's surface , and we hardly know anything about it			1
we humans are creating big problems because of what we do n't know			1
we take fish from the ocean to eat without really knowing where they came from , or what they eat , or how many of them there are , or if we 're maybe taking the last one			2
we dump whatever we like in the ocean and watch it float away -- to where ? who cares ? the ocean is a massive , unexplored area of our planet , and in the @entity31 , we spend less on getting to know it than we spend on getting to know outer space			1
and our lack of attention is showing			2
@entity37 fish are shrinking in size from year to year ; coral reefs are being scraped away , and glorious ocean habitats are dying			1
but because it happens in the blank blue part of the globe , we do n't hear about it or if we do , we do n't pay attention			1
watch the story of a woman who rowed the @entity48 so how can we get your attention on the ocean -- so we can start solving these problems we 're creating ? in april , we went on a trip to the @entity54 with 100 ocean scientists , activists and artists , filmmakers and musicians , to talk about what 's going on in the ocean and what we can do to help			1
on the @entity62 , we heard things and saw things that shocked us -- like @entity66 's picture of shrimp bycatch , the 8 pounds of dead sea creatures that are thrown away as garbage in order to catch 10 ounces of shrimp			0
@entity74 's talk about the glory and shame of the oceans and we saw @entity78 describe a nearly lifeless ocean taken over by jellyfish			1
we also saw amazing things , thing that blew our minds -- like watching a bioluminescent jellyfish light up its mating display in the pitch - black deep ocean			2
we talked with some of the smartest people we 've ever met , and we came up with some big plans for saving the ocean			2
but we came home from the trip still wondering -- will it make a difference ? we 're not scientists , but we know something we can do : encourage you to talk and think about the ocean , with hope that you will be more involved in the things that will make a difference			2
it 's hard to think about having a role in saving something so overwhelmingly immense			0
but you can be a part of making things better			0
in fact , all of us have to			0
here are some great places to start : write a letter to your elected representative			0
handwrite it ; it makes a difference if you do			0
let them know you support increased funding for the @entity112			0
the more we learn about the ocean , the better we can protect it			2
if you live in @entity115 , thank your legislator for being part of the ban on sharkfin soup ; if you live outside @entity115 , ask your state or county representatives why it has n't been banned yet where you live			0
if you 're on @entity125 , join the @entity127 page or if you 're on @entity128 , follow @ @entity129 to keep up with ocean news			0
get one of those little responsible seafood guides , and use it			0
if you eat fish , tell your fish guy that sustainable fish is important to you , and not to sell you any more shrimp from overseas			0
and do n't eat any more bluefin tuna or sharkfin soup			0
did you know we killed 10 million sharks last year just for their fins ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 and @entity146 .			1

@entity149 oil *disaaster* has drawn attention to the oceans for 6 weeks
@entity145 and @entity146 say we do n't pay much attention to oceans , 71 percent of planet
in @entity31 , we spend less on ocean exploration than on space , they say
*chases* : " glorious ocean habitats are dying "
