@entity0 comes the hard part for @entity3			1
having reached the @entity6 final , she 'll have to overcome longtime nemesis @entity7			1
to utter that @entity3 is the underdog saturday is like saying @entity9 is a decent player			1
@entity10 leads the second - ranked @entity3 16 - 2 in their rivalry -- but has won 15 matches in a row			1
during that streak , she has conceded three sets to the @entity17			2
if that 's not enough , @entity7 has never lost a semifinal or final in @entity20 , her record improving to 11 - 0 after topping fellow @entity23 @entity22 7 - 6 ( 5 ) 6 - 2 thursday in the semifinals			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , has failed to win a major outside @entity25 in seven years			1
but all the imposing statistics do n't appear to be fazing the ever steely @entity3 , who last downed @entity7 at the year - end championships in 2004			1
" i think my confidence should be pretty high going into a final of a grand slam no matter who i 'm facing , and whether i 've had a terrible record against someone , it does n't matter , " @entity3 , a 6 - 3 6 - 2 winner over compatriot @entity37 thursday , told reporters			1
" i got there for a reason			0
i belong in that spot			0
i will do everything i can to get the title			0
" some would say , too , that @entity3 has fate on her side			1
she was almost knocked out in the second round , needing to save a pair of match points against qualifier @entity48			0
and only last year @entity50 took advantage of her second chance in @entity20 , fending off a match point in the third round before going on to capture a second grand slam title a week later			0
since the second round , @entity3 has n't come close to dropping a set			1
" everyone 's going to expect me to win , but @entity3 is playing unbelievable , " @entity7 was quoted as saying by the @entity58 's website			1
" she was almost out of the tournament and came back , and she 's playing better in every single match			2
" she has nothing to lose , once again , " @entity7 later told reporters			2
" she has only things to gain			0
and i feel that way , too			0
" i 've won this tournament several times			0
i do n't have to go out there and have another title			0
i want it , but it 's not life or death for me			2
i think that helps me relax			0
so , yeah , she absolutely has nothing to lose , and i have nothing to lose , so it will be fun			0
" @entity7 is chasing a 19th grand slam title , which would separate the 33 - year - old from retired legends @entity80 and @entity81			1
she ultimately had too much game -- and experience -- for the 19 - year - old keys , who made her debut in a grand slam semifinal after eliminating @entity7 ' older sister , @entity87 , in her maiden grand slam quarterfinal wednesday			1
the big - hitting keys , continuing to play with tape on her injured left thigh , broke for an early lead in the first set			2
once @entity7 settled , though , she was rarely troubled on serve			2
it took a little longer than anticipated for @entity7 to finally oust @entity22 , with the teenager saving eight match points			2
" i was a little frustrated at the end , " @entity7 said			2
" i had so many match points and just could n't close it out and that does n't usually happen			0
" but in retrospect , she was playing very well			0
i 'm a really big fan of hers			0
she 's so awesome , so positive , just a great player			0
" not only did @entity7 defeat keys , but she later got a chance to meet one of her favorite singers , @entity107			1
@entity3 's win over @entity37 , who was appearing in a second straight grand slam semifinal , was n't as dramatic although the five - time grand slam champion did let a 3 - 0 first - set advantage fade			1
the turning point came when @entity37 was broken at 3 - 4 in the opening set			0
the night match on @entity116 on thursday saw two - time grand slam winner @entity117 beat 2010 @entity120 finalist @entity119 6 - 7 ( 6 ) 6 - 0 6 - 3 7 - 5 to reach the men 's final			1
on friday , top - seed @entity123 battles defending champion @entity125 in the other semifinal .			0
