@entity0 -- a @entity3 government ban on @entity4 has provoked widespread fury in @entity3 , and condemnation around the world , with the country 's own president taking to the social media website to condemn @entity12 's actions			1
@entity3 's prime minister @entity13 , who blames social media for fueling anti-government rhetoric , threatened to " eradicate " @entity4 at a campaign rally in the city of @entity18 on thursday			1
within hours @entity3 internet users were reporting widespread disruptions to the service , and hashtags including @entity23 and # @entity24 were trending worldwide			1
freedom of expression campaign group @entity25 said the ban , which it called " censorship of which the worst authoritarian regimes would be proud " was " emblematic of the increasingly authoritarian tendencies of the prime minister @entity13			1
" millions of @entity4 users from across @entity3 quickly found ways to circumvent the blockade -- with help from @entity4 itself -- and voice their anger and frustration at the government 's move			2
others posted satirical pictures and cartoons			0
@entity4 ban batters @entity3 's image , but does @entity13 care ? @entity3 's president , @entity44 , defied the ban to send out a series of messages questioning the government 's actions			1
" one can not approve of the complete closure of social media platforms , " he posted			2
" it is not possible technically to completely block access to platforms like @entity4 ... i hope this implementation does not last long			0
" but @entity3 analyst @entity56 , from international think - tank @entity57 , said the president 's tweets should be taken with a pinch of salt			1
" the president has very little credibility on this issue , since he approved the law which allowed this ban to happen ; it seems he and the prime minister are playing a good cop / bad cop routine			2
" @entity56 said @entity4 had been targeted as a way of blocking the public 's access to information amid a government corruption scandal and in the run - up to key local elections at the end of march			2
" the government of prime minister @entity13 has restricted the flow of information through traditional media -- newspapers and television news -- and so the @entity85 has become the last preserve of freedom of information in @entity3 , " he told @entity1			1
" when you restrict the traditional media , people will resort to alternatives			0
" @entity56 said social media sites such as @entity4 , @entity93 and @entity94 had also proved extremely effective in mobilizing the opposition and in facilitating protests in @entity3 in the past 18 months			1
@entity97 , the @entity98 's commissioner for enlargement , said the ban " raises grave concerns and casts doubt on @entity3 's stated commitment to @entity104 values and standards			0
" " freedom of expression , a fundamental right in any democratic society , includes the right to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority , " he said in a statement			0
" citizens must be free to communicate and choose freely the means to do it			0
this obviously includes access to the internet			0
" a spokesman for @entity124 's @entity123 also suggested that blocking access to @entity4 may harm @entity3 's long - held hope of becoming a member of the @entity98			2
@entity4 ban is the least of @entity3 's woes " social media has a vital role to play in a modern democracy , and helps to promote transparency and vibrant public debate , " he said in a statement			1
" we have long supported @entity3 's accession to the @entity98			0
as a candidate country , it is important for @entity3 to promote the @entity98 's core values of freedom of expression , democracy and the rule of law			2
" but even before the ban came into effect , @entity13 had insisted he did not care what the international community had to say about it , and @entity56 said the criticism was unlikely to change his stand against social media			1
" @entity104 's influence on @entity3 is tied to the hope of accession to the @entity98 , and since there is a stalemate on that , @entity104 has lost its influence , " he explained			0
instead , he said , @entity13 's priorities lay closer to home			0
" the prime minister 's top priority is to win the elections , and to stamp his authority on @entity3 politics , rather than to react to the views of @entity104 leaders			1
" professor @entity170 , from the political science department at @entity172 in @entity173 said that while this month 's votes are , in theory , local elections , in practice they may act as something of a referendum on @entity13 's rule , ahead of presidential elections later in the year			2
" depending on what happens in these elections , probably the @entity164 will decide to run or not to run for president , " @entity170 said			0
" there is a general feeling that maybe conditions have already worked against him , that maybe his candidacy is not particularly powerful , but that decision is not yet final			0
" @entity56 said that although the core of @entity13 's conservative , religious supporters were unlikely to care about the @entity4 ban , it may yet come to damage the prime minister , politically			1
" @entity3 who oppose the government will oppose the ban , but it is the bread - and - butter issue of the economy that concerns his supporters , " he said			0
" the economy is what underpins @entity13 's popularity , and the @entity4 ban could come back to bite him if his capricious misuse of this law scares off foreign investors and undermines confidence in the @entity3 economy			1
" @entity1 's @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
