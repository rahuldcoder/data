@entity36 's national security council convened after news broke about @entity0 's death and was still meeting as of 2 p.m. monday , president @entity34 's office said			1
the president canceled the rest of his monday schedule , and all members of @entity36 's military have been placed on " emergency alert , " according to @entity34 's office			1
under the alert -- which is short of the highest possible level -- @entity36 forces will monitor @entity1 troop movements closely and tighten security measures at sea , according to the ministry of defense			2
in addition , @entity36 's @entity54 has ordered police across the country to be on emergency work shifts			2
" @entity36 's concern is warranted , frankly , because an insecure @entity1 could well be an even more dangerous @entity1 , " a @entity60 official said			1

the son of @entity80 , founder of the communist nation , @entity0 had been in power since 1994 when his father died of a heart attack at age 82			1
the enigmatic leader was a frequent thorn in the side of neighboring @entity36 , as well as the @entity60			0
there have been reports in recent years about his health , as well as that power will be transitioned to his son , @entity93			0
@entity1 's nuclear program -- and international attempts to hinder its nuclear weaponry potential -- put @entity0 at odds with many world leaders in recent years , as did his governing style			1
@entity100 : send us your reaction under his leadership , @entity1 was largely closed off to outside influences , fearful of threats from its neighbors and subject to decades of political socialization			0
at the same time , it also sought international aid after extensive famines that contributed to the deaths of tens of thousands of people			0
both @entity1 and @entity36 have shown signs of concession in recent years -- @entity116 has expressed willingness to engage with countries involved in multilateral talks aimed at @entity1 's denuclearization , while @entity121 recently sent humanitarian aid through @entity124 agencies to help the malnourished population in the @entity1			1
but relations between the two rival nations soured yet again when @entity1 launched an attack on the @entity36 island of @entity130 , killing two @entity36 marines and two civilians			2
@entity60 defense secretary @entity133 said earlier this fall that the greatest threat from @entity1 is weapons of mass destruction			0
" @entity1 continues to defy the international community as it enhances its nuclear weapons , its ballistic missile programs and continues to engage in dangerous and destabilizing proliferation activities			0

two senior @entity60 military officials said then that they believed the pace of @entity1 's planned regime change from @entity0 to his 20 - something son appeared to have slowed			1
the son , also known as @entity0 , started his career as a four - star general and in recent years was given more official duties by his father			0
" he 's clearly the designated successor , " @entity161 , a senior fellow at the @entity60 - @entity162 who once worked for @entity163 , said of @entity93			0
" this has been in place for a while			0
" @entity161 said he expected that , in the short - term , @entity1 would " rally around the flag ( and ) hunker down			0
" but given the nation 's deep - rooted economic and other problems , maintaining that unity and control without a overarching figure like @entity0 in place may be more difficult			0
" the deeper questions come over the long - term , " @entity161 said .			0
