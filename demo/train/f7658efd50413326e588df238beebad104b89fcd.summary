and a wave of suspected jihadist arrests from @entity5 to @entity6 to @entity7			1
@entity9 officials are scrambling to stop the spread of terrorism and threats , with foreign ministers meeting monday in @entity14 , @entity7 , to tackle the issue			1
" we start with obviously a discussion on how to counter terrorism , not only in @entity20 but also in other parts of the world , " said @entity16 , @entity9 high representative for foreign affairs			0
she said she had just met with @entity24 secretary - general @entity23 " as the threat is not only the one we faced in @entity26 , but also spreading in many other parts of the world starting from @entity30 countries			0
" and we need to strengthen our way of cooperating together , first of all with @entity33 countries , and then internally			0
" with new developments sprouting up across @entity20 , here are the latest : the hunt is still on for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in raids last week , @entity7 's justice minister said			1
the suspected leader and key link between senior @entity45 operatives in @entity46 and the @entity7 terrorist cell , @entity7 - @entity49 @entity45 fighter @entity48 , is still at large , a senior @entity7 counterterrorism official said			1
@entity48 's last known location was believed to be @entity6 , the official said			2
an @entity53 national who may have links to @entity48 was arrested over the weekend in @entity6 and is being extradited to @entity7			1
the man detained by @entity7 police after last week 's raid has been identified			1
his attorney says he is n't a terrorist ; he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
but investigators believe the man played a key role in the terrorist cell 's plot , the @entity7 counterterrorism official said			1
investigators are looking for a man whose dna was found on a gun magazine used by @entity74 , who killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket in @entity26			1
sales of counterfeit goods by @entity82 attacker @entity81 helped fund the purchase of weapons , a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in @entity5 told @entity0			1
five @entity7 nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week 's raid in @entity91 , federal prosecutor @entity85 said			1
the terror cell planned to target police officers , he said			1
@entity7 counterterrorism agencies think the suspected ringleader of the cell is likely @entity48 , the senior @entity7 counterterrorism official said			1
according to @entity97 , a reporter at the @entity7 newspaper @entity98 who tracks @entity7 foreign fighters in @entity46 for the blog " emmejihad , " @entity48 is a 27 - year - old from the @entity104 district of @entity14 who traveled to @entity46 in january 2014 and joined @entity45 soon afterward			2
the two gunmen killed in the @entity91 raid , @entity7 of @entity107 descent from the same @entity14 district , were in phone contact with an @entity45 ringleader in @entity6 , who @entity7 authorities believe was likely @entity48			1
but @entity7 authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an @entity53 suspect arrested in @entity6 over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and @entity45			1
that 33 - year - old suspect was wanted in @entity7 on charges of terrorist activity , @entity6 police said monday			2
@entity7 is requesting an extradition			2
and @entity6 is n't done yet ; police there say they have made multiple arrests and are looking for more suspects			0
other countries are also helping @entity7 nab suspected jihadists			1
@entity5 authorities captured two suspects as they were trying to cross from @entity5 into @entity132 , @entity85 said			0
four days after police raided a suspected terror cell in @entity91 , @entity7 , killing two people who authorities said were part of a terrorist cell on the brink of a major attack , we now know the name of the surviving suspect			1
@entity144 was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack , among other charges , said his attorney , @entity154			2
but @entity154 said his client was not involved in any terrorism			0
" he went to @entity91 to see his fiancée and was dropping off a pair of sneakers , " @entity154 said			0
" he did not know that these guys were connected to international terrorism			0
he arrived , he sat down and , the moment he sat down , the policemen starting shooting			0
he managed to escape by jumping out the window			0
the other two , however , took their guns and responded and got killed			0
" authorities say it was n't just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
investigators believe @entity175 played a key role in the terrorist cell 's plot and was a key intermediary between two dead gunmen and a wider network in @entity14 , the senior @entity7 counterterrorism official said			1
@entity175 is also believed to have fought with @entity45 in @entity46 at some point			0
there are still concerns that part of the terror cell remains at large in @entity7 , and could take revenge for the death of their comrades , the senior counterterrorism official said			1
@entity7 security services suspect around 10 people were involved in the cell , but they do n't know the number for sure and that worries them			1
@entity7 counterterrorism officials believe the cell had ambitious attack plans beyond attacking police , given bomb - making chemicals found in their safe house in @entity91 and police uniforms			1
they also suspect terrorists were plotting multiple attacks			0
the belief is that the cell has now been disrupted and will take some time to get back on its feet			2
the wider cell was being monitored for less than two months			2
over the last several weeks , @entity7 security services started monitoring the @entity91 group 24/7			2
why did police move in last week ? one reason , the official said , is that the cell obtained weapons and @entity7 police could not continue round - the - clock surveillance indefinitely			1
investigators say @entity218 found in a car used to transport @entity221 market attack gunman @entity74 has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks , according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation			1
investigators are still looking for a person whose dna was found on a magazine for @entity74 's gun			2
@entity74 is the gunman who killed four hostages on january 9 at a kosher grocery store in @entity26 before police killed him			0
before the siege , he had proclaimed his allegiance to the @entity237 in @entity238 and @entity46 , or @entity45			0
the assault happened during three days of terror in @entity5 that began with the attack on offices of the @entity82 satirical newspaper in @entity26			1
in all , 12 people died in the @entity82 attack on january 7			2
@entity246 , @entity248 's @entity247 affiliate , claimed responsibility for the @entity82 shootings			2
on monday , @entity0 affiliate @entity251 reported @entity82 cartoonist @entity252 will succeed editor @entity253 , who died in the attack			2
although @entity5 officials said they thought @entity81 had given up terror - related activities and moved to end surveillance on him after he began selling counterfeit goods , it turns out the proceeds from those sales were being used to buy weapons , a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in @entity5 told @entity0			1
that 's just one of several missteps by intelligence agencies in @entity5 being revealed by the investigation into the attacks , the source said			0
other failings include a lack of communication and delays in circulating information , according to the source			0
in one case , a @entity5 surveillance agency received an alert about one of the @entity81 brothers ' phones in february 2014 , but it took four months for information to be passed on to the country 's main domestic spy agency , the source said			0
by then , neither brother was under surveillance , the source said			0
the surveillance on @entity81 ended in november 2013 ; the surveillance on @entity292 , the older brother , ended in june , sources have told @entity0			0
also , authorities now say they think both @entity292 and @entity81 traveled to @entity247 in 2011 via @entity294 , even though @entity81 's passport had been confiscated in 2010			0
however , investigators have been unable to find either brother 's name in travel databases , according to the source			0
@entity0 's @entity301 , @entity302 and @entity303 contributed to this report .			0
