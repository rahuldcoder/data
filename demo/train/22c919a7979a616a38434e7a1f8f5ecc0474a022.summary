nearly a third of the world 's economic output will come from countries facing " high " to " extreme " risks from the impacts of climate change within 12 years , according to a new report			1
the @entity8 , an annual report produced by @entity11 - based risk analysis firm @entity10 , found that climate change " may pose a serious obstacle to sustainable economic growth in the world 's most commercially important cities			1
" the index ranked the vulnerability of the world 's countries , and the 50 cities deemed most economically important , to the impacts of climate change , by evaluating their risk of exposure to extreme climate events , the sensitivity of their populations to that exposure and the adaptive capacity of governments to respond to the challenge			1

it projected the population of those countries -- currently estimated at more than 4.5 billion -- could exceed 5 billion by 2025			0
the index 's findings bore particularly bad news for @entity52 , which topped both lists , with its capital , @entity55 , ranked the most vulnerable city due to its exposure to threats such as flooding , storm surge , cyclones and landslides , its susceptible population and weak institutional capacity to address the problem			1
along with the @entity52 capital , the four other cities categorized as facing " extreme risk " from climate change impacts were also located in @entity70 -- @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 -- and projected to be centers of high economic growth			1
" the combined gdp in these cities is forecast to almost triple from us $ 275 billion to us $ 804 billion by 2025 , representing the greatest combined growth in any of the risk categories , " said the report , released wednesday			2
the figures , it said , underlined the way in which " cities with some of the biggest economic growth potential are among those with the greatest vulnerability to climate change			1
" @entity91 's chief scientist @entity90 said the report highlighted " just how urgent the need is for the international community to tackle climate change			1
" " without a binding global agreement the economic and social impact of global warming will be devastating , " he said			0
" it would be morally negligent for countries with large emissions to ignore the mounting evidence of the impact global warming that shows that some of the poorest nations on the planet will be hit hardest , while those nations who are seeing the first signs of economic growth after years of stagnation will see those gains washed away by consequences of global warming			0

@entity52 was followed on the list of most vulnerable countries by @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity124 , @entity137 , @entity138 , the @entity128 and @entity139			2
the vulnerability of many @entity142 countries -- which accounted for 14 of the 20 most at - risk nations -- was partly due to their natural susceptibility to extreme climate - related events such as floods , droughts , fires , storms or landslides			2
but it was also a consequence of the vulnerability of the population , and the inadequacies of existing infrastructure to adapt to or tackle the problem , due to weak economies , governance , education and healthcare			0
countries in south and southeast @entity70 , which accounted for one - third of all " extreme " risk nations , were likely to face an increased risk of severe flooding due to projected changes in seasonal rainfall			0
these would also increase the likelihood of summer droughts , and in turn , declining crop yields			0
the most susceptible populations in these areas were in areas with high levels of poverty , and where large populations had clustered on marginal land such as flood plains or coastal regions in cyclone - prone areas			0

one exception was @entity135 , where poor healthcare access , weak infrastructure , high levels of poverty and an over-reliance on agriculture placed the country into the " extreme " category			0
@entity207 's head of environment , @entity206 , said that identifying where the risks of climate change were going to be highest was " now an imperative for both business and governments			2
" " framing the risks in economic terms makes the issue harder to ignore , especially for business , and it may prompt better preparedness planning , " he said			0
" nothing prompts corporate or political action faster than having to deal with the aftermath of an extreme climate event			0
" @entity224 and @entity225 were the only two cities ranked as " low risk , " while @entity228 , followed by @entity229 and @entity230 , were the least vulnerable countries			2
in september , the @entity232 published its latest assessment report , a benchmark study on global warming involving the efforts of nearly 1,000 researchers around the world			2
it expressed widespread , rising confidence among scientists the climate is warming , that humans are responsible for at least half of the increase in temperatures since the 1950s .			0

climate change may be " serious obstacle " to sustainable growth in key cities , says report
the climate change vulnerability index is published by risk analysis firm @entity10
nearly a third of the world 's economy will come from highly or extremely vulnerable places
@entity52 was the most vulnerable country and its capital the most vulnerable city
