-- the roadside bomb that smashed into @entity3 sgt. @entity2 in northern @entity4 two years ago ripped off both legs below the knee			1
retired army sgt. @entity2 , who lost both legs to a roadside bomb , meets with a doctor in @entity10			1
now he 's 45 , living in retirement in @entity10 and confronting the rest of his life without the use of his legs			2
yet he worries mainly about the thousands of younger @entity17 service members who also have been maimed by makeshift bombs in @entity4 and @entity19			1
" younger ones are taking it harder , " @entity2 said			2
" they feel they do n't have the rest of their lives			0
" roadside bombs and other homemade explosives have been a deadly staple of the wars in @entity4 and @entity19 , killing or wounding thousands of @entity17 service members and civilians			1
such improvised explosives devices -- " ieds " to the military -- are the " weapon of choice " for insurgents , @entity17 officials say			0
they 're mostly cheap , easy to build and triggered by simple remote control			0
protecting @entity17 troops from such bombs is a top priority at the @entity42			1
it has spent $ 14 billion in the past four years to fight homemade bombs			1
it even created an agency for that purpose -- the @entity48			0
that agency has had some success , a new report says , but insurgents continue to kill and maim @entity17 service members with homemade bombs , in part because the bombs fulfill their purpose and it is easy to acquire the materials used to construct them			1
the report came from a subcommittee of the @entity61			0
it followed two years of hearings and study			1
the number of ied attacks has dropped in @entity4 and gone up in @entity19 , said @entity67 , a spokeswoman for the ied organization			1
yet there are more than 1,400 such attacks a month in @entity4 and @entity19 and an additional 350 elsewhere , a sign that insurgents continue to rely on them			1
" we are in a long war , a persistent conflict with a group of insurgents who want to wear down our will so we quit -- the purpose of an ied , " she said			0
" the enemy recognizes ieds as the weapon of choice			0
" the ied agency has developed and fielded electronic jammers that prevent the bomb 's trigger signal from reaching the explosive , the congressional report said			1
it also has pursued better vehicle armor			2
the agency has been developing intelligence , fostering police work , funding surveillance and attacking insurgent networks that produce and set up the bombs			2
it has been involved in training troops on how to confront and look for the weapon			0
yet the report said the group needs to improve the way it measures its performance , because it is n't clear in many cases whether the group 's actions or other factors have led to various strides in confronting roadside bombs			2
the report also said the organization needs to widen its authority to include other agencies that confront roadside bombs , and get better oversight			2
@entity67 , the spokeswoman for the @entity48 , agrees with these conclusions			0
she said the organization appreciates the opportunity to work with the @entity120 , the investigative arm of @entity121 , " to identify and resolve any problem areas in our processes			0
" she said the cooperation among agencies is crucial			0
" global terrorism will continue to manifest itself through use of @entity84 , " she said .			0

number of homemade bomb attacks down in @entity4 , up in @entity19
@entity42 says $ 14 billion spent in past four years to combat homemade bombs
