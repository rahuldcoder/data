-- is she a good @entity3 girl gone bad ? @entity4 has taken to the 140 - character site to offer up a steamy image of herself on wednesday -- in which she strikes a strategically covered - up topless pose with the message , " where have you been all my life ? ! " the post has sent already - wagging tongues into overdrive , wondering if this is just another part of her alleged feud with @entity17 's current girlfriend , model @entity16			1
last week , the songstress tweeted a feasibly harmless but potentially offensive picture of a packet of rice cakes dressed up in hoop earrings and shades with the caption , " @entity19 make you my b * * * *			1
" @entity4 's followers made the obvious link to @entity30 , who is half - @entity32			1
then , when one of @entity4 's followers asked her to save him some rice cakes , she responded with , " @entity35			1
" was it all a thinly veiled dig ? maybe			0
on her " @entity39 ( remix ) " single with @entity17 , she does sing , " @entity41 than a rice cake / cake worth sipping			2
" and anyone who has ever eaten a rice cake knows that yes , they can be dry			2
while we were busy decoding @entity4 's twitpic game , @entity30 retaliated with @entity49 lyrics on her @entity50			1
" i win you loose ! ! ! [ sic ] * nicki voice * i mean i got him , you got pictures of him " with a friend posting adding , " i 'm @entity57 , you @entity58			0
c'mon , you see where @entity60 at			0
" jab ? again , maybe			0
@entity30 tweeted that she does n't even have a @entity50 page , but that retreat did n't seem to phase @entity4 , who fire back song lyrics from @entity49 's rival , @entity66 : " i 'm a leader , yall on some followin s * * * , comin in dis game on some modeling s * * * ! " is this a full - on feud ? it 's all still a mystery			1
either way , it 's clear these two wo n't be trading friendship bracelets and braiding each others ' hair anytime soon			2
what do you think ? is this a war of words or is just some silly social - media back - and - forth ? see the full article at @entity0			0
