-- @entity1 of holding two @entity3 races next season has been kept alive after a new @entity4 of @entity5 was added to the 2014 calendar			1
there had been fears that the new race on the @entity10 would not go ahead after @entity3 boss @entity11 told @entity0 last month that race organizers had not raised enough money to fund it			2
an inaugural grand prix in @entity15 has now been included in the record - breaking 22 race calendar issued by motorsport 's global governing body , the @entity17 , friday			1
" the entire @entity4 of @entity5 team is thrilled to join the 2014 @entity17 calendar and we look forward to bringing world class @entity3 racing to @entity15 , " race promoter @entity25 , @entity19 said			1
but the race , scheduled for 1 june , has a provisional status which means it could still be dropped from the sport 's global tour			1
@entity30 has also been penciled in to stage a grand prix for the first time since 1992 , when the event was held in @entity34			0
a provisional race in 2014 has been given a date of 16 november			2
@entity40 , the destination for the next race of this season , has been moved forward to april and has also been given provisional status on the 2014 calendar			1
@entity3 returned to the @entity5 in 2012 with the inclusion of the @entity5 @entity4 held at a new circuit just outside @entity45 , @entity46			1
the @entity4 of @entity5 is planned to be held on 3.2 miles of public roads in @entity48 , a district in the @entity15 towns of @entity50 and @entity51			1
it snakes alongside the @entity52 and would give the race a spectacular backdrop of @entity56 's historic skyline			0
construction on the site is well under way , and last year three time world champion @entity60 and former @entity3 driver @entity61 drove demonstration runs on the circuit for the @entity65 team			0
however , a lot of the work has focused on the pit building in a new block of garages which was already planned to be built			0
the @entity17 will need to approve the site before it is given the green light in 2014			0
the @entity15 race has already been postponed once , having been initially scheduled for june this year			1
the wheels started to come off in august 2012 when @entity75 , the president of the race , unexpectedly resigned			0
it was recently revealed that the @entity4 of @entity5 organizers appointed investment bank @entity79 in june to raise $ 100 million which is required for the race to go ahead			1
the 2014 @entity3 calendar features a record 22 races , starting in @entity83 on 16 march with a finale in @entity85 on 30 november			1
@entity86 also makes a return to the calendar in june -- a race that has not been given provisional status			1
the return of @entity86 means @entity65 , whose f1 team has won the drivers ' and constructors ' titles for the past three years , can look forward to a home race			2
the race will be held at the @entity99 , which staged the @entity86 @entity4 between 1970 and 1987 in its former guise as the @entity99			2
@entity102 rubber to stay the meeting of the @entity17 's @entity104 in @entity105 also confirmed @entity102 will continue as @entity3 's sole tire supplier in 2014			1
the @entity109 company 's future in the sport was in doubt after a series of blow - outs wreaked havoc at the @entity115 @entity4 and led to fears that the drivers ' safety was being compromised			0
earlier in the season , a spate of worryingly delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- had already led to worries the tires were not safe			0
but @entity102 have since introduced a new tire structure for the second half of the season and the @entity17 has agreed the company will continue to showcase its rubber in motorsport 's elite racing series			0
the @entity17 said in a statement : " in order to cover the transition period and considering the contracts already settled by @entity136 and the teams with @entity102 , the @entity104 confirmed that @entity102 may continue to supply tires to competitors in the @entity17 @entity3 , subject to the requisite technical and safety standards of the @entity17 being met			0
" the @entity17 also announced that , along with the company headed by @entity3 's commercial boss @entity11 , it had also agreed a " strong and stable sporting governance framework			2
" the deal known as the @entity145 effectively splits the sport 's commercial revenues between the governing body , @entity11 's group and the teams			0
the @entity17 revealed it would have a larger share of the pie , stating : " this agreement provides the @entity17 with significantly improved financial means			0
" @entity3 generates more than $ 4bn in revenues annually -- and with more races in 2014 that sum could be set to rise .			2
