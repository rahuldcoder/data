-- @entity3 's @entity2 title came at a staggering cost , with the @entity6 - owned team splashing huge amounts on transfer fees and wages for high - profiles stars like @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity15 's expensively assembled squad is worth the astronomical wage bill is debatable , but it would seem @entity3 's fans are getting their money 's worth after the @entity20 champions topped a " @entity21 " released this week			1
the league , compiled by the @entity23 , ranks @entity25 's top - flight clubs based on how much fans pay for their season tickets compared to how the team performed during the 2011 - 12 season and how many goals they scored			1
and it is @entity3 who emerged on top , with the team 's home fans enjoying 18 wins , one draw and 55 goals in the club 's 19 @entity2 games at the @entity41			1
who are @entity45 football 's " @entity43 ? " just like on the pitch , @entity3 beat off competition from neighbors @entity48 , who placed fourth			2
second on the list were @entity52 , who , despite flirting with relegation for the majority of the season , provided their fans with more entertainment than their more illustrious rivals			2
at the other end of the scale , @entity60 have been ranked as the worst value for money for their fans			1
despite escaping relegation to earn a second successive season in the @entity2 , @entity60 -- owned by @entity68 chief @entity67 -- offered their fans the worst performances based on the cost of a season ticket at @entity72			1
brand power : @entity75 's most valuable clubs unveiled just above @entity60 are @entity76 , who last week dispensed with the services of legendary manager @entity79 after fans endured the club 's worst @entity2 campaign			2
supporters gathered in the famous @entity84 stand at @entity76 's @entity86 stadium saw just six home wins for the @entity88 during 2011 - 12 , with the five - time @entity45 champions finding the net on only 24 occasions			1

out of a sample of over 2,000 fans , 9 % said they would not be renewing their season tickets regardless of price , with 7 % set to renew if the price does not increase and 13 % yet to decide			2
@entity23 ceo @entity103 is not surprised a section of fans are questioning the need to attend games given the current economic climate			2
" @entity75 fans face the same economic difficulties as everyone else and supporting their team can be a costly outgoing , " @entity103 said in a press release			0
" so it 's not surprising that many fans are questioning the value for money they 're getting from their club			0
" despite facing financial difficulties , @entity103 said many fans will ultimately renew their season tickets due to the emotional connection they feel to their team			0
" come the excitement that the start of the new season brings , it will also be interesting to see how many fans put the love of their club ahead of other financial priorities			0
" of the 20 clubs in the @entity2 , 12 have frozen or lowered season ticket prices ahead of the new season while five have announced price hikes			1
the @entity131 ( @entity131 ) is a voluntary organization representing fans across @entity133			0
the @entity131 told @entity0 that , while ticket prices differ throughout the league , the issue of admission prices is still a pressing one for football fans			1
" prices vary from club to club so it 's unfair to put every one in the same category , " said an @entity131 spokesman			0
" but it is fair to say ticket pricing is a major concern for fans			0
" the @entity131 went on to explain how ticket pricing and the possible introduction of safe standing areas into football grounds were two issues which fans would like to see addressed			0
