@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 -- it 's pitch dark as we drive through the villages of @entity2 's most populous state			1
no street lights line the roads which cross large swaths of farmland ; the only flashes of light come from the bolts of lightning which flicker across the stormy night sky			0
a powerful dust storm has knocked out power supplies as we head into @entity1 's @entity20 district , but the headlights of our car illuminate the hazy figures of men and women squatting behind roadside bushes to defecate			1
some 120km ahead of us lies the village -- @entity30 -- where two schoolgirls were attacked when they went out into the fields to relieve themselves tuesday night ; the pair were gang raped and later found hanged in a mango tree			1
the brutal assault has brought a range of challenges facing @entity2 into the international spotlight , almost 67 years after the country gained its independence from @entity42 rule			1
at @entity45 , villagers mourning the two girls blame a cocktail of issues for the horrific rape attack , from a lack of decent sanitation , to underdevelopment , to what they call police " slackness " in response to the girls ' disappearance			1
according to @entity59 , @entity2 has the highest number of people in the world -- an estimated 620 million -- who defecate in the open ; only half of the nation 's population uses toilets			2
most of those living at @entity45 have little choice in the matter			0
" there 's no toilet			0
where can the girls go ? " shouted @entity74 , one of those who had gathered to mourn the dead girls , as she sat on the mud floor of their home			0
" no one has done anything for sanitation , " she complained			2
" we are scared , " screamed @entity85 , another of the women consoling the pair 's bereaved mothers			0
" if this could happen to them , it could happen with us also			0
" watch : @entity2 outraged by gang rape and murder the mourners also accuse police of apathy , echoing concerns raised over and over again by human rights groups and activists concerning the handling of cases by @entity2 's law enforcement officers			1
most of the country 's policing system is based on the 19th - century , colonial - era @entity106 ( @entity106 ) , designed in the wake of an armed uprising against @entity42 rule in 1857			0
in its 2009 report , @entity111 - based @entity110 reported that @entity2 police forces have yet to evolve from the @entity106 's original pattern of behavior			2
authorities have acknowledged in past years that the country 's police have also been under - staffed and under - resourced			2
@entity30 's police station has been temporarily shut down after the attack drew national and international attention			1
two of its officers are among five people who have been arrested in connection with the schoolgirls ' deaths			1
the arrests so far notwithstanding , the murdered girls ' families are unforgiving about the police 's response to the case			0
" if police wanted , my daughter would have been alive today , " the father of the eldest victim wailed .			0
