-- how on earth is a movie about @entity3 rated @entity4 ? the @entity3 not only oozed sin and raw sexuality from the stage , but his life off it was one long rap sheet of domestic - violence charges , blackout drug benders , and indiscriminate gunplay			1
to be fair , all of this is touched on in @entity18 's ( " @entity17 " ) biopic of the @entity20 in @entity21 â € ” but with kid gloves			1
" @entity22 " too often plays it safe when it needs to be dangerous			2
' @entity22 ' trailer : the evolution of @entity3 it does n't help that writers @entity26 and @entity29 - @entity28 chronologically pinball around like @entity31 - starved kids , never trusting the audience to take in the full sweep of the @entity36 singer 's life			2
in the opening reel alone , the film jumps from 1988 ( a high - speed chase with the cops that resulted in jail time ) to 1968 ( performing under fire in @entity44 ) to 1939 ( his impoverished @entity46 childhood )			0
the best thing the movie has going for it is @entity51 's live - wire channeling of @entity3			1
with his gravity - defying pompadour , raspy jive patter , and quicksilver shimmy - slide dance steps , the " 42 " star sweats through a two - hour funk workout , belting '' @entity58 , '' '' @entity59 , '' and '' it 's a @entity60			0
'' how @entity51 went from playing @entity61 to @entity3 in the most poignant scene , @entity63 , as the mother who abandoned @entity3 , shows up backstage to leech off his wealth and fame			1
both she and @entity51 are devastating			2
and for that brief moment , " @entity22 " shows us the kind of movie it could have â € ” and should have â € ” been			0
