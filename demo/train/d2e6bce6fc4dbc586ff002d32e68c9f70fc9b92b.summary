@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is a 6 - foot - 1 - inch , 250 - pound police detective who served four tours in @entity6 with the @entity7			1
but even someone with that size and life experience is no match for an @entity13 tornado , as @entity3 learned sunday night when one struck his house in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" my feet were actually being pulled in the air , " @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity16			1
" i was just trying to figure out what i was going to do to keep there , and ( @entity21 ) just kept grabbing for the first thing i had			0
and that was the ( bathtub ) faucet			2
and basically , some debris fell on me and kind of held me down			0
" @entity3 's home was one of about 8,000 structures destroyed by the twister 's swirling 200 mph winds , city manager @entity26 said , citing a @entity33 report			1
the devastation " looked like some of the things i 'd seen in @entity40 , " @entity3 told @entity16 , recalling his stints as a military policeman who came upon the aftermath of several firefights			2
although @entity3 lost his home , in some respects he 's lucky			1
his wife was away at work when the tornado hit , and the two dogs in the house -- his family havanese and a black @entity50 from work -- safely rode out the storm in a closet			1
beyond that , @entity3 says he 's fortunate to live in a community where so many people are reaching out to help each other -- especially the newly homeless			1

" we 've had numerous offers			0
( @entity0 residents ' ) friends and family are opening their homes			2

" while many trials lie ahead for the people of @entity0 , @entity3 is encouraged by everyone uniting for the better good			1
" the @entity84 spirit is there , " he said			0
we 'll get through this			0
we just have to bond together			0
