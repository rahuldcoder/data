coach @entity5 demanded total commitment from @entity1 as they celebrated another @entity11 title			1
@entity1 were crowned champions on saturday after closest challengers and city rivals @entity14 went down 2 - 1 at @entity15			1
any thoughts they would take their foot off the gas were dispelled as goals from @entity21 ( 45 ) , @entity22 ( 52 ) and @entity23 ( 76 ) secured the win			0
" it was important to win , there would n't have been much point to our party if we had n't won , " said @entity5			1
" this was a serious match , we were n't kidding around			0
our strength is that we always play very seriously			0
" even today i got angry because we still had the aim of winning the top scorer trophy , not for ( @entity23 ) @entity23 but for the whole team -- even ( @entity22 ) @entity22 had to play for @entity23			0
" the @entity37 scored his 22nd league goal of the season in the 76th minute and is only one goal behind @entity42 's @entity41 in the @entity44 goalscoring charts			1
but it was captain @entity46 and goalkeeper @entity47 who pleased @entity5 the most			1
" the player who surprised me the most was @entity46			0
his passport can not be telling the truth ( claiming he 's 35 ) , it must be 10 years out , he 's incredible , " added the former @entity50 and @entity51 manager			2
@entity5 has already started looking ahead to the quest for a fifth successive @entity44 crown and already has transfer targets in mind , such as @entity60 's @entity59			1
" if you win one , a second and then more titles it 's difficult and a fifth will be harder still , " he said			2
" we are not very far from signing @entity59 , who is a striker in top form			0
" we need a second striker			0
this year we had big problems in central midfield and we need two players there with physical strength and a different tactical ability to the players we have at the moment			0
" and then a defender other than two or three in the youth team that i like a lot			0
" @entity1 's hold on second place was strengthened as @entity82 could only manage a 2 - 2 home draw with @entity84 with @entity85 a point back in fourth after they beat @entity87 1 - 0			1
@entity60 came from behind to secure the point they needed to qualify for the @entity88 next season thanks to a 2 - 2 draw with @entity90			2
@entity91 hold the last @entity93 spot , but are just two points ahead of @entity95 after the @entity96 beat @entity97 2 - 0			1
meanwhile , veteran @entity1 midfielder @entity98 has announced that he will retire at the end of the season			1
" i finish in the best possible way , " @entity98 told @entity102 sports newspaper @entity101			2
" i will no longer play at a high level			0
" @entity98 , 36 , won four @entity106 title in spells with @entity108 and @entity109 before joining @entity1 in the summer of 2005			1
" this is a first for me , " he added			0
" i 've never won a title without playing			0
it 's always difficult to win a league title in @entity11			2
but with respect to the previous @entity44 titles , this one feels different because it has been slightly more difficult			2

@entity1 mark fourth successive @entity44 title with 3 - 0 victory against @entity4
@entity5 's side can not be caught after @entity14 's defeat at @entity15
