@entity0 , @entity1 -- to pick up the morning paper and see the word " recount " in a headline stirs an ominous case of déjà vu			1
judge @entity9 examines a ballot in @entity11 , @entity1 , during the election recount in 2000			1
at issue in recent days in @entity14 is a local judicial race that is hardly of national note			1
but problems with administering the local election , and statements from county officials that some critics call confusing , if not contradictory , have some worried about the coming presidential election			1
polls showing a dead heat in the battle for @entity1 's 27 electoral votes only add to the drama			1
" @entity31 , software-wise , procedure-wise , training-wise , there is no confidence that these people will be ready in less than 50 days for the election we are all going to have , " said @entity29 , the @entity14 @entity29 chairman			1
" never again ! " was the county 's promise after the butterfly ballots and hanging chads of the 2000 recount drama			1
for 2004 , the county switched to touch - screen machines			0
there were no major issues here			0
but some local democrats , including rep. @entity48 , demanded changes because they said the touch - screen system might be vulnerable to fraud and did not , in their view , provide a reliable audit trail			0
so the county switched again , to its third system in eight years , this time a paper ballot that is scanned by an optical reading device			0
the paper is then retained in case of recounts or other irregularities			0
local officials say the system works and promise a smooth @entity64			0
but @entity29 says the recount in the judicial race proves the folly of switching			0
" we could have had nice , reliable computers counting and giving all of us an honest count , " he said in an interview			0
the 2000 recount drama led to major changes -- more than 40 states made changes or adjustments to the way they conducted and administered elections			1
" we have had more change in our election process since 2000 than we have seen since the @entity87 , " said @entity82 secretary of state @entity81 , a recent past president of the national association of top state elections officials			1
@entity82 alone spent some $ 67 million on new equipment , including a statewide voter file , and also requires a color photo id on @entity64			1
@entity81 takes issue with those who question the reliability of newer , high - tech systems			0
" you know , we use technology in every one of our financial transactions and social transactions -- why did we not until 2000 put that type of technology to use when it comes to our most sacred civic transaction , you know , the voting process ? " @entity81 asked in an interview at his office in @entity107			1
" the technology is just a tool			0
and what the conspiracy theorists want you to believe is the technology runs the election -- and nothing could be further from the truth , " he said			0
" if you have well - trained people who know how to use that technology and those tools , to know what to do if a battery dies on election day , all those things , then you will have a fair and an accurate election and the people are the ones who will produce that			2
and if they are not trained and they are not prepared , then you are not going to have a good election			0
but it is the people , not the machines			2
" @entity82 expects a record number of new voters this year , and @entity81 is changing his usual advice as a result			2
in the past he has encouraged voting on @entity64 , saying it builds community spirit and gives voters up to the last moment to ponder their choices			2
but this year , given the high interest in his state and nationwide , he suggests voters who are certain they will not change their minds help ease the burden -- and the potential for mistakes on @entity64 -- by taking advantage of any early voting options in their states .			2

@entity14 , @entity1 , has changed voting systems twice in past eight years
@entity158 chairman says " no confidence " election will go off without problems
2000 recount drama in @entity1 led to changes in election procedures in 40 *+* states
@entity82 official says it 's people , not machines , that make elections run smoothly
