-- @entity1 plays football like he tackles life -- with flair , excitement and a sense of fun			1
at 20 , he is potentially the best young player on the planet , and is tipped to follow in the illustrious footsteps of @entity11 icons such as @entity12 , @entity13 and perhaps even the legendary @entity14			1
the @entity17 forward 's flamboyant tricks and flicks have captured the attention of scouts around the world , with his exceptional solo strike against @entity23 earning him @entity26 's 2011 @entity25 award for the year 's best goal			1
and his flair on the pitch is more than matched off it			0
@entity1 was pictured several times lapping up the party atmosphere during the recent carnival season in his homeland			1
can @entity36 cash make @entity37 a football force ? " i 'm 20 years old , i have to take advantage of being young , " he told @entity0			1
" it 's hard , especially for me			2
i want to do this and that , but i have to follow a line			0
i 'm a professional player and a professional athlete			2
i have to resist some things to get ahead in the future			0
" despite his appetite for the sights and sounds of @entity52 and @entity53 , @entity1 is still working hard to improve all aspects of his game			1
" i 'm always trying to perfect everything -- dribbling , shooting , headers and control			0
you can always improve , " said the striker , who last year helped @entity17 win @entity63 's top club tournament , the @entity62			1
@entity1 is also becoming an increasingly important part of the @entity69 ' @entity68 national team , scoring eight goals in his first 16 games for his country			1
" being on the @entity11 team is a privilege , " he said			0
" there are some marvelous players and i 'm very happy to be among them			0
" in 2014 , the @entity77 will arrive in @entity68 , and the country 's football fans expect their " @entity82 " to claim a record sixth crown on home soil			1
but @entity1 is not letting himself get distracted by dreams of glory			1
" it 's two years away , it 's a long time			2
but in football , time passes quickly			2
so i have to constantly be playing a good game , constantly working so that i 'm in every line up , " he said			2
whether @entity1 will still be plying his trade in @entity68 when the four - yearly tournament comes around is unclear			1
he has been heavily linked with a move to @entity95 and @entity96 champions @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity100 side @entity99			0
" i do n't know about the future , " he said			0
" it is two years , a lot can happen			0
i do n't know if i 'll leave or if i 'll stay , there are a lot of things ahead ... @entity97 is an excellent team			0
if not the best team of all time , then they are among the best			2
" joining the @entity110 club would give @entity1 the chance to team up with a player who he has been drawing favorable comparisons with , @entity116 's three - time @entity115 winner @entity114			1
" the best player currently is @entity114			1
i think he is a great player at an excellent time on a great team			2
so for me , he is the best , " he said			0
earning a move to one of @entity122 's leading teams would depend on @entity1 keeping on the straight and narrow			1
if he does stray too far from his sporting duties , his father is there to get him back on track			0
" my father has been by my side since i was little , " he said			0
" he takes care of things , my finances and my family			0
" he is the one who is in charge			0
there 's always somebody nearby , keeping an eye on me more than watching me			2
