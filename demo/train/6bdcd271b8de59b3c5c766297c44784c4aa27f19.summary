-- a possible constitutional crisis loomed in @entity2 following the reported death of president @entity4 , once hailed as a positive steward for the southern @entity7 country			1
@entity4 , 78 , died of a heart attack on thursday and his body was flown to @entity10 , according to government sources			1
however , there was no formal government statement announcing his death , and the chaotic politics of the impoverished nation raised questions about what happens next			2
under the constitution , vice president @entity19 would succeed @entity4			1
however , @entity19 was expelled from the ruling @entity21 in 2010 in a dispute with @entity4 over the president 's efforts to position his brother rather than the vice president as his eventual successor			1
@entity19 formed her own party , but remained vice president			1
a government spokeswoman declined to discuss reports of the president 's death but declared that the vice president can not take over the presidency			1
" the conduct of the honorable @entity19 in forming her own opposition party precludes her from being eligible to succeed the presidency , " said @entity33 , who serves as information and civic education minister			2
in a news conference earlier friday , @entity19 told reporters she was kept " in the dark " regarding the president 's condition			0
however , the @entity2 defence forces , which provides security for the sitting president , shifted security members to @entity19 's residence amid news of the death			2
while declining to comment on the president 's condition , @entity33 appealed to @entity2 residents to remain calm and only listen to information coming from official government sources			1
the @entity55 and @entity56 have urged @entity2 to observe the succession process in the constitution			0
" we are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power			0
we trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly , " said @entity62 , the @entity55 assistant secretary of state for african affairs			1
during her news conference , @entity19 , along with former president @entity66 , called on @entity2 to adhere to the constitution regarding the issue of succession			0
@entity4 , a former @entity70 economist who studied in the @entity55 and other countries , was elected president in 2004 after campaigning as an " economic engineer			1
" he won re-election five years later for a term scheduled to end in 2014			0
his initial years in office were considered a success as he focused on battling corruption and working to improve the economy			1
he implemented a subsidy program for agricultural products that was credited with boosting the economy of the largely agrarian nation			1
@entity2 welcomed his focus on reducing reliance on food aid and attaining self - sufficiency			0
however , his popularity plunged in recent years as the economy faltered and the nation faced chronic fuel shortages and frequent power blackouts			1
anti-government groups accused @entity4 of dragging @entity2 back into a dictatorship , citing the passage of bills they say infringe on citizen rights			2
protesters took to the streets last year demanding immediate government action to address the economic plight			0
security forces cracked down , leading to more than a dozen deaths and sparking international condemnation			0
critics also accused @entity4 of jeopardizing international relations and risking foreign aid that benefits the nation 's poor			2
last year , @entity4 expelled a @entity56 envoy who was quoted criticizing him in a leaked diplomatic cable , straining relations with one of @entity2 's largest foreign donors			2
in return , @entity56 asked @entity2 's top envoy to leave the country and rescinded her invitation to the royal wedding			0
at the time , @entity121 said it was halting " all general budget support " to the nation			0
last month , the @entity55 announced it was suspending $ 350 million allocated to @entity2 because of concerns about its democratic governance			0
@entity0 's @entity127 and journalist @entity128 contributed to this report .			0
