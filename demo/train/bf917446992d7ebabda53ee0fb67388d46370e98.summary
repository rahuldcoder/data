the @entity2 and @entity3 audition rounds of " @entity4 " brought us a few solid acts -- and one stunning one -- and an utterly ridiculous amount of screentime dedicated to losers and fools			2
have i been suckered into recapping " @entity12 ? " thankfully , @entity13 and company redeemed themselves by sticking a grey - sweatered dagger into that festering zit of a human being @entity19 ( stage name ) at the very end of the show			2
if you look up " the worst " in a dictionary , you will find this tattered seafoam creature , standing all alone with only his terrible attitude and a trash - basket @entity28 to keep him company			2
for the rest of his life			2
i 'd love to have seen more footage of promising " yeses " like @entity35 ( one of " only like seven " male sopranos in the world -- as if ) , or blink - and - you 'd - miss - her @entity38			2
31 - year - old blonde - banged @entity40 , i know you 've just become able to fly out of your birdcage , but come back to me ! hog farmer @entity43 , sing to me some more ! i almost always feel like a pig , so i promise it wo n't be weird			2
stick with me , people ! no dice			0
in lieu of more quality time spent with promising acts like girl group @entity52 , country singer / teacher @entity53 , and music instructor @entity54 , we got entire segments devoted to the likes of a defective @entity58 doll ( if @entity58 dolls had been around in the ' 80s ) and motormouth yawns like @entity61 and @entity62			1
( the ensuing inter-judge antics re : ghosts was pretty much the dumbest thing i 've ever seen , and i 've been watching " @entity66 " for 13 seasons			0
) the airtime devoted to yellow - bloused high school junior @entity69 was a little easier to swallow , because it 's been a while since we 've seen @entity71 put on her thinking cap and concoct a delicious scheme to trot up and hug someone			1
that poor girl 's life would have been a lot worse from that moment forward if @entity78 had n't done that			1
and she was sweet , you know ? i would have hugged her myself			0
i can not say the same about @entity81			0
despite an inspirational visit from local hero @entity85 and a giant rainbow - colored beach ball , the talent in @entity2 was dreadful			0
" honest to @entity87 , nothing , " complained @entity13			0
" i hope this is the worst session			0
i 'm beginning to wonder why we came here			0
" way to inspire people to keep watching , boss			0
cue music ! meet vanilla ice @entity52 , 21 , who got fired from a job at the airport because all he wanted to do was dance			1
those planes do n't need to know where they 're going ! what @entity52 lacks in vocal talent and fully - grown - in eyebrows , he makes up for with fancy footwork and enthusiastic family members			1
@entity107 even did an overhead clap during @entity52 's rendition of @entity111 's " trouble			1
" a beaten - down @entity112 immediately gave in , " because this is really the entertainment business			0
" @entity114 suggested @entity52 lose the @entity116 choreography and focus on his vocals , and @entity13 declared " @entity52 , i absolutely love you			1
the episode was getting that bad			0
but @entity120 , 18 , redeemed it completely			1
finally ! we heard her entire amazing performance of @entity125 's " @entity124 " -- cutting her off would have seemed illegal			1
i got total @entity129 / @entity128 vibes from @entity120 's voice alone			1
the fact that she has such a real , unassuming personality on top of the voice makes me want to go buy her entire album right now			1
it was so refreshing to see such a good - natured reaction to the crowd 's overwhelming reception			1
there 's nothing worse than an 18 - year - old who knows she 's the s ---			1
the judges were nearly passing out with excitement			0
" this is why i do this			0
people like you inspire me , " said @entity82 , who will never come close to singing as well as @entity120 in her life			1
she 's the best contestant we 've seen by far			1
@entity154 , 49 , used to tour with @entity155 as part of a band called @entity158			1
i took the liberty of googling this up and now i 'm kind of obsessed with him : here 's where i finally felt the potential magic of " @entity4			2
" i mean , seriously ? this guy ? " why not this guy ? " seems to be the whole point of the show			0
it 'll take some getting used to -- especially when i 'm not instantly sold on a contestant 's performance quality in present - day -- but i can legitimately see myself becoming invested in real people with real , living - out - of - their - car problems ( who are n't , like , 17 )			1
@entity174 broke out a rote @entity177 tribute act with " @entity178			1
" ladies loved it ; girls adored it , but @entity13 could see right through it and asked him to sing 15 seconds a cappella			0
during that entire commercial break i honestly wondered if maybe this guy would freeze up and either refuse for some creepy reason or not be able to think of just the right song			2
but he did ! @entity82 , who 'd been switching up her dialects according to the occasion , called @entity174 " one of the funkiest cats i 've seen up here			0
two hours of actual funky cats auditioning for @entity4 probably would have flown by			0
along with @entity120 , @entity195 , 21 , gave the most @entity198 @entity197 audition			1
she was un-jaded , pretty , intrigued @entity13 before even singing ( rugby coach ! ) , and i loved the way she rearranged the @entity201			0
@entity82 once again adjusted her critique to the personality in question and tossed @entity195 a " tough jock girl " bone by awarding her " a big ol ' fat juicy delicious @entity208			0
" you guys , i have no idea why i 'm only spotlighting @entity82 's lines			2
