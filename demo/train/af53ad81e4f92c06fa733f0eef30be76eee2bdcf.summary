two families scarred by the @entity2 war -- and joined by the memories of a couple who dared to love across the ethnic divide -- have the same message of peace as the nation marks the 20th anniversary of the conflict			1
in @entity15 , @entity13 and @entity14 live in a plush apartment scattered with photos and a huge painting of their daughter @entity19			2
half - a - day 's drive away in a @entity23 village , @entity20 lives in a comfortable home where the centerpiece is a tv stand converted into a photo frame of her smiling son , @entity28 with @entity30			2
@entity28 was @entity23 , @entity19 was @entity31			2
they were childhood sweethearts before the war ripped @entity2 apart			1
together , they tried to escape the besieged city of @entity15 but were shot as they tried to cross the @entity37 , and died in each other 's arms			1
as their bodies lay together for eight days -- with no one able to safely retrieve them -- they became known as the " @entity44 of @entity15			1
" today they are in @entity15 's @entity47 cemetery still lying together , a symbol that defies the hatred of the ethnically charged war , and their parents have remained close friends			1
see these amazing photos from the war both sets of parents said they blame the politicians , not the soldiers , for their loss , and both recognize ethnic resentment can simmer beneath @entity2 society but they also said the time has come for those still harboring hate to start living without prejudice			1
in @entity68 , a small village 14 kilometers from @entity69 in @entity23 , @entity20 , a widow since before the war , lives with her son , @entity71			2
she is recovering from a stroke and walks with a crutch			0
despite the passing of 20 years she remembers the deaths as if they were yesterday and photos of @entity78 and @entity30 dominate her home			0
the photos show the couple as teens learning to love and as adults in each other 's arms			1
they had been together for nine years when they were killed on may 18 , 1993 , both age 25			0
in @entity15 , retired mechanic @entity13 and @entity14 live with their daughter @entity90 in a new apartment block -- part of the construction program that has disguised many of the landmarks of the three - year siege			2
just like @entity20 , the home has photos of their children throughout			0
when they talk about their loss they are at pains to remember all 11,541 killed during the siege			0
as @entity15 rebuilds it is also trying to move on from the war			1
a plaque was erected on @entity37 to commemorate victims of the war but amid the bustle most locals just walk past it			0
the bullet - pocked walls are being pulled down			0
they have been replaced by new apartment buildings , @entity118 fast food shops and a 20 - story tower			0
many people in the city now were born after the war and they are keen to look forward			0
for many that also means not talking about the war			0
if they learn the lessons from their city 's @entity44 the future could be bright .			1

@entity2 marks 20th anniversary of the *outbreak* of the war *fought* *largely* on ethnic grounds
message of peace from parents of @entity15 's ' @entity44 '
