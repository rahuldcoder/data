inspired by a @entity5 fact - checking website , a group of @entity2 activists has created the @entity6 , aimed at holding the new @entity2 president to his promises			1
it 's " an attempt to document and monitor the performance of @entity2 president - elect @entity11 " over his first 100 days , the @entity6 website says			1
much like the @entity13 from @entity14 , which tracks @entity5 president @entity17 's promises , the @entity6 lists numerous promises @entity11 allegedly made while campaigning for the presidency , including offering incentives and promotions for police who restore security in their areas , new penalties for smuggling fuel , and changes on the streets to improve traffic			1
it 's a project of @entity32 , a non-profit group that says its goal is to fight crime and corruption			2
@entity37 , a 24 - year - old organizer with the group , told @entity39 the idea for the @entity6 sprang from a conversation he had with another young activist			1
" we decided to follow @entity5 - like initiatives of monitoring the promises of politicians after the naming of the president , " and one member of @entity32 began to write down @entity11 's campaign vows , @entity37 said			1
" we are a group of @entity2 who do n't belong to any political ideology and , for the record , we are not by any means political activists , " he said			2
" we are average @entity2 youths who want to use whatever they do best to bring about change in @entity2			0
" @entity2 elections : ' women need a champion ' @entity37 said he voted for @entity11 , the @entity61 candidate , over @entity62 , who served as the final prime minister under ousted president @entity64			2
it was " a choice between revolution and reproducing the past regime			0
" the group has not heard of any reaction from @entity11 to the website			2
unlike the @entity5 presidency , @entity2 's presidency is largely a figurehead position -- particularly after the military junta running @entity2 recently claimed full legislative and budgetary authority and said the president has no control over the military			2
@entity37 said that while it 's unclear how much power the president will have , he hopes @entity11 fulfills promises through selecting " a good government " and gaining public support			1
" what matters to me here is how much support we are gaining , unexpectedly , " for the @entity6 , he said			1
he believes it will help change how candidates look at the electorate			0
@entity37 said he got the @entity6 online before leaving for a conference in @entity94 , @entity95			1
@entity32 hopes to change the " mindset " in @entity2 and get more people to be " more positive and involved , " he said			0
" we want to bring @entity2 to a new era of accountability , open government and citizen involvement , " @entity37 explained			1
the site is not about " criticism or advocacy , " he added			0
" it 's a portal of data			0
people can use it later , as much as they like , to form whatever opinions they want to hold			0
" the site currently lists 64 promises			1
@entity37 says the group will soon launch an official @entity115 version			0
the @entity13 , from @entity116 - winning @entity14 , currently lists about 500 promises @entity17 made while campaigning for the presidency			1
it says he has kept 37 % , broken 14 % , and compromised on another 12 %			0
" i know of similar efforts we 've inspired in @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , " @entity14 editor @entity120 said tuesday			1
" we 're thrilled that journalists around the world are adopting the approach of our @entity13			2
it 's a new form of journalism that holds public officials accountable for their campaign promises			0
it shows the power of the @entity134 and the value of accountability journalism			0
" what is the @entity61 ?			0

the @entity6 is modeled after the @entity13 from @entity14
it currently lists 64 promises
the group behind it wants " a new era of accountability , " a member says
the @entity13 says president @entity17 has so far kept about a third of his promises
