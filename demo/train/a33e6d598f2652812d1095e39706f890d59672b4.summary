-- defending @entity5 champion @entity4 has been forced out of this year 's race due to an ongoing knee condition , the @entity3 's @entity2 team announced on friday			1
@entity8 , the first @entity9 rider to win cycling 's most prestigious event , withdrew from the @entity12 with a chest infection on may 18 and he was scheduled to rest and train as well as receive treatment on his knee			1
but the seven - time @entity17 medalist , who has also withdrawn from the @entity18 and the @entity19 , has now ran out of time to adequately prepare for the @entity5 , which begins on the island of @entity22 on june 29			0
" it 's a huge disappointment not to make the @entity5			0
i desperately wanted be there , for the team and for all the fans along the way -- but it 's not going to happen , " the 33 - year - old told @entity2 's official website			2
" i ca n't train the way i need to train and i 'm not going to be ready			0
once you accept that , it 's almost a relief not having to worry about the injury and the race against time			1
" i 've been through this before , when i broke my collarbone , so i know how it works			0
i 'll get this sorted , set new goals for this season and focus on those			0
" team principal @entity43 expressed disappointment at the news , although it had already been confirmed @entity8 would play second fiddle to compatriot @entity47 at this year 's @entity5			1
" with illness , injury and treatment @entity49 has gone past the point where he can be ready for the @entity5 , " said @entity43 , who is also performance director of @entity48			0
" it 's a big loss but , given these circumstances , we wo n't consider him for selection			0
" he has n't been able to train hard since the @entity12 and now he needs further rest			2
whilst we all know these things happen in sport , it does n't take away from the fact that this is a huge disappointment for everyone in the team -- and above all for @entity49			0
' " it 's incredibly sad to have the reigning champion at @entity67 but not lining up at the @entity5			2
but he 's a champion , a formidable athlete and will come back winning as he has before			2
" team doctor @entity69 said @entity8 had completely recovered from his chest infection , but his knee was worse than first thought			1
" " the chest infection that caused his withdrawal from the @entity12 has responded to treatment and rest			1
it has completely cleared up , " explained @entity69			0
" however , further medical investigations on the knee injury that we were managing at the @entity12 showed the condition was more significant than we thought			1
" it has needed intensive treatment and , whilst it will be fully resolved , @entity4 now needs to rest completely for five days before a gradual , return to full training over a period of two to three weeks			0
" @entity8 was set to play a supporting role to @entity67 's lead rider @entity47 at this year 's tour			1
@entity88 - born @entity47 finished second in last year 's race and is one of the favorites to take the yellow jersey in 2013 .			1
