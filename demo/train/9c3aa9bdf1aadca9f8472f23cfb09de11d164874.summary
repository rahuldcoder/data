@entity0 -- nearly six months since popular protests toppled @entity4 president @entity3 , fighting between @entity6 's military and @entity8 rebels continues in eastern @entity6			1
@entity9 insists that it should be permitted to send aid to the conflict - battered region , many of whose residents are @entity9 speakers			0
it has sent a convoy of trucks it says are carrying relief goods to the border			2
but the @entity0 government has expressed fears that the mission is a camouflaged effort to smuggle supplies to @entity8 rebels			1
both countries have asked the @entity28 for help facilitating any delivery of aid			0
" from @entity0 , @entity1 's @entity32 explains what 's happening on the ground			0
what do the rebels still control ? the rebels still control the cities of @entity38 and @entity39 , as well as some border checkpoints in the east			0
however , the @entity6 military appears to have been quickly retaking the territory around the two cities			1
it claims that the militants control just 20 % of the area they controlled at the height of their power in eastern @entity6			0
is the @entity6 military still advancing ? yes , and it appears in recent days the @entity6 military has been making headway against the rebel forces			1
maps provided by the @entity6 government indicate the size of the rebel territory is shrinking every day			0
the strategy of the @entity6 military has been to break up and isolate the territories , cutting off key roadways and corridors to disrupt what it says is a flow of weapons and fighters from @entity9			1
@entity9 denies claims by @entity0 and the @entity69 that it is providing support to the rebels			1
why is @entity9 sending convoys -- both aid and military -- now ? publicly , @entity9 officials claim their humanitarian convoy only contains aid to help the people who are suffering in eastern @entity6			1
but there are reports that some of the trucks now being inspected are nearly empty			0
meantime , @entity84 journalists and the @entity6 government report an armed @entity9 convoy was seen crossing the border from @entity9 thursday night , something @entity6 has been alleging for months			1
such reports feed into the skepticism of the @entity6 government about this supposed humanitarian aid			0
what 's the perceived threat ? is this an invasion or just a show of force ? it 's not an invasion , and not really a show of force either because these armed convoys have allegedly been crossing under the cover of night			0
as for @entity9 's humanitarian convoy , it appears to be a move allowing @entity9 to publicly show its sympathy for those are currently suffering because of the fighting in eastern @entity6			1
but allegations of covert weapons smuggling that would allow the bloodshed to continue , raise questions about @entity9 's true intentions			2
in an interview monday with @entity116 , @entity114 secretary general @entity113 spoke of a " high probability " that @entity9 will invade @entity6			2
" we see the @entity9 developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation , and we see a military buildup that could be used to conduct such illegal military operations in @entity6 , " he said			1
what has been the reaction in @entity0 ? @entity0 lawmakers and military officials are not surprised			0
they say this is nothing new , it 's just the first time that @entity84 journalists have observed an armed convoy crossing from @entity9 into @entity6			1
they 're also grateful that foreign journalists have been able to observe and report on this armed convoy because they feel it corroborates their ongoing claims and justifies their skepticism and mistrust of the true intentions of this @entity9 aid convoy from @entity143			1
what 's the bigger picture : is this all about @entity147 warning the @entity69 not to expand into @entity6 , and other former @entity149 satellite states ? @entity6 lawmakers believe that @entity147 wants to control @entity6 in an attempt to reestablish a new version of the @entity153			0
@entity6 would be an important part of that plan			0
at the same time , if @entity6 were to align more closely with @entity156 and see its economy revived , it would not bode well for @entity9 citizens , who are watching closely what is unfolding in @entity6			2
for example , the former the @entity149 state of @entity162 saw tremendous economic benefits after its alignment with @entity156 , while under @entity167 , @entity6 's economy plummeted and government corruption ran rampant			2
@entity9 wants to exert its power and influence , and if @entity6 successfully integrates into the @entity172 -- and benefits from that partnership -- it would be a huge setback for @entity9 politically and strategically .			2

nearly six months after @entity6 's @entity8 president fell , *clashes* continue in the east
the @entity6 military is fighting @entity8 rebels , and *accuses* @entity143 of supporting them
@entity9 has sent a convoy of trucks it says are carrying aid to the border with @entity6
but @entity0 has expressed fears the trucks are an effort to smuggle supplies to the rebels
