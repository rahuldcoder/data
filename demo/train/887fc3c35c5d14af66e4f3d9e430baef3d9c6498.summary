-- @entity3 , a @entity4 - era singing star who found renewed popularity as the viral web 's " mr. @entity3 , " died monday , @entity2 media reported			1
@entity3 had been in a @entity8 , @entity2 , hospital since suffering a stroke in april			0
@entity3 was considered one of the @entity12 's great performers in the ' 60s and ' 70s			1
but his claim to fame in the rest of the world came in 2009 after a @entity18 video posting of him performing the @entity2 pop song " @entity20 , ' cause i 'm @entity21			1
" with a toothy grin , @entity3 delivers a clearly lip - synced performance minus lyrics , instead using a series of made - up syllables , including the " trololololo " that captured the hearts of millions			1
according to @entity30 , the original lyrics , about a cowboy riding his horse home to meet his sweetheart @entity35 , were censored because they were deemed " un-soviet			0
" that led to his " mouth music " version , which ends up sounding like a mash - up of yodeling and jazz - era scat singing over a cheesy orchestral arrangement			1
soon , the video was being used online as a new target for the bait - and - switch rickroll meme in which a user posts a link to something supposedly relevant or interesting but turns out to be a ridiculous or annoying video or image instead			2
the original video was viewed more than 12 million times , with alternate versions and parodies racking up millions more			0
@entity3 became aware of the song 's viral success after hearing his grandson humming the tune , according to @entity61			1
@entity3 performed it several times afterward , with family members even starting a @entity18 channel for him			0
on monday , @entity3 was remembered on the same social - media sites where his video spread			0
several tributes had been voted up to the main page of @entity70 , and both his real name and " mr. @entity3 " were trending on @entity72			2
" oh no , mr. @entity3 ( i.e. @entity3 ) has died , " @entity73 , an editor for tech blog @entity74 , wrote on the site			2
" the world is a sadder place			0
... i 'm glad the @entity80 gave him a lasting memory ! "			0
