@entity0 , @entity1 -- the lower house of @entity1 's @entity4 has approved a controversial media law that spells out media ownership rules and calls for the creation of a regulatory agency			1
@entity1 president @entity9 has blamed @entity10 for her low approval ratings			1
the measure passed thursday by a vote of 147 to 4 , but the wide margin does not reflect the heated debate over it			1
lawmakers opposed to the measure protested by walking out of the chamber and not voting			1
some even threatened to turn to the courts to challenge the legitimacy of the vote			2
the goal of the so - called @entity25 law is to regulate television and radio broadcasters and increase competition in the media industry , according to a draft of the bill			1
opponents say it targets media critical of the current government and president @entity9 , especially the media giant @entity10			1
this bill is " for everyone who wants to live in a more democratic and more pluralistic @entity1 , " @entity38 said in a speech last month			2
the newspaper @entity10 has been highly critical of her leadership and that of her husband and predecessor , @entity47			1
although the proposed legislation would not affect newspapers , @entity10 's other business interests in cable , television and radio would be forced to be sold off or restructured			1
" [ @entity9 ] @entity9 saw [ @entity55 ] as a limit to her power , and this was the origin of the conflict , " @entity1 political analyst @entity54 said			0
@entity1 's case is just one of a number of fights between the presidency and the media in @entity66			1
" at this moment , in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity1 , the presidents have conflicts with the private media and seek to dominate them , although each country is a different case , " @entity54 said			1
among the changes proposed in the bill , a company that owns a cable business would not be allowed to own any over-the - air broadcast channels			2
also , the owner of a cable company would be allowed to have only one channel on that system			0
in its current form , @entity10 would be in violation of both limits , among others			1
" it hits other media groups , but @entity55 is the one it hurts , " said @entity89 , an analyst at @entity90			2
the reform would also redistribute broadcast frequencies into thirds : one - third for private media , one - third for the government and one - third for nongovernmental organizations and other civil groups			1
" more control of the media by the government , this is the main motivation , " @entity89 said			1
journalism advocacy groups have raised concerns , focusing on a proposed requirement that broadcasters renew licenses every two years			0
" we are extremely concerned at the opportunity created under the current draft legislation for political pressure on broadcasters , " @entity110 director @entity109 said in a statement			0
" we urge @entity1 legislators not to pass this bill in its current form			2
" if anyone is applying unfair pressure , it is monopolistic media companies , @entity38 said			2
" freedom of expression can not turn into freedom of extortion , " she said during an august 27 speech			0
" the right to information means the right to all information , not to the concealment of part of the information and the distortion and manipulation of the other part			0
" @entity10 has about two - thirds of the cable market in @entity1 , but its other products do n't come close to monopolistic figures , @entity54 said			1
both @entity142 have blamed @entity55 's critical reports for their low approval ratings			0
the ruling party was dealt a strong defeat during recent midterm elections			0
in response , @entity38 has come out swinging at the @entity10 newspaper and its parent company , observers said			1
last month , the government pushed the nation 's soccer association to rescind a contract it had with @entity55 to broadcast games			0
the government reached into its coffers and offered the association double what @entity55 was paying for rights to broadcast the games			0
this month , 200 tax agents made a surprise raid on the newspaper 's offices , ostensibly to check employment records , editor @entity163 said			0
but the agents left after three hours , empty - handed			0
" their real mission was to intimidate , " @entity163 said			0
the editor bristles at the characterization of the bill as part of conflict between his newspaper and the government			2
the @entity142 " have a hostile stance , not just against @entity55 but against all the press , " he said			0
" they are the proponents of ' democratizing ' the media through this law , and this is how they regard the media ? it 's paradoxical			0
" @entity2 en @entity187 's @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
