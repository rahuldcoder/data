-- " the @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have no understanding of what 's happening here , " a foreign diplomat posted in @entity2 told me in the summer of 2012			1
at the time it was still possible for an outsider like me , having recently arrived in @entity2 from @entity12 , to imagine @entity14 's imminent departure			1
even a @entity16 official had dismissed his regime as " a dead man walking			0
" but non-westerners who had spent years in @entity2 were less hopeful			1
they rejected reports in the @entity6 press prophesying the demise of the government			1
@entity25 , they said , was popular among the minorities			0
besides , the army 's loyalty to him was near - absolute			0
today , @entity14 is more powerful than he was 15 months ago			1
for all the predictions of his impending overthrow , his baathist machine remains the only stable feature in @entity2			1
despite the carnage , daily life in @entity34 , @entity14 's bastion , largely continues as before			1
there have been no major defections , and most importantly the @entity39 , despite suffering more than 30,000 fatalities , continues to pledge its allegiance to @entity14			1
in the past two months , it has reclaimed from the opposition territory outside @entity34			0
yet , instead of recalibrating its response , @entity45 remains tethered to its same narrow policy goal : @entity14 's removal from power			1
@entity50 devoted his speech wednesday in @entity52 , where representatives of the @entity2 government and some opposition groups have assembled to hold peace talks , to reiterating this demand			1
this is an unrealistic expectation			0
far from achieving @entity14 's exit , it will prolong the violence			2
@entity2 government representatives did not go to the negotiating table to throw away his gains			1
the so - called @entity66 that forms the basis of @entity50 's demand does not in fact call for @entity14 's removal			2
and he is unlikely to budge without a credible threat of force from the @entity6			2
@entity50 claimed this week that such a threat was still " on the table			0
" in truth , @entity45 's options are severely limited by the embarrassing fact that the opposition that has come to @entity52 to wrest power from @entity14 does not have a significant constituency in @entity2			1
its members hold little sway over the mujahideen fighting government forces			0
much of the territory outside the government 's control is held by groups linked to @entity87 , and @entity87 is opposed to the peace talks			2
it is aware that it could emerge as the unintended beneficiary of any @entity93 attempt to dislodge @entity14			2
even the " moderate " elements of the opposition appear to be beyond @entity45 's control			0
the peace talks in @entity52 were deemed crucial by @entity45			0
yet members of the opposition repeatedly threatened to derail them if their demand to exclude @entity101 from the process was not met			0
@entity50 had been attempting for weeks to get a seat for @entity104 at the talks because he grasped that , as a regional power that has abetted @entity2 in its civil war , @entity101 's presence was vital to progress			2
this irked @entity111 , the @entity113 theocracy that is alarmed by the thaw in relations between @entity104 and @entity45			2
@entity111 's intervention in @entity2 has always been part of its effort to blunt @entity101 's influence and cripple what it sees is a @entity123 corridor of power in the @entity125			1
as the principal backer of the opposition , @entity111 has played a key role in transforming @entity2 into a haven for foreign jihadists cut from the same ideological cloth as the men who carried out the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity101 hurt its own interests by refusing to adhere to preconditions , which in @entity104 's view bound it to an unfavorable outcome -- a @entity111 - backed transitional government -- even before the talks had begun			2
but its abrupt exclusion from the peace talks is a triumph of @entity111 policy			2
all of this explains why @entity14 , despite having presided over the slaughter of so many @entity2 , was able to ridicule the negotiations as a " joke			1
" his decision to dispatch a delegation to participate in them was in deference to his sponsors in @entity153 who , having labored hard to halt the threat of a @entity6 military strike against their client last year , are eager to demonstrate the utility of diplomacy			1
@entity161 , the @entity153 foreign minister , was quick to cast the opening day as a success			0
" for the first time in three years , " he said , " the sides -- for all their accusations -- agreed to sit down at the negotiating table			0
" but the framework for the negotiations already looks obsolete			0
hammered out in 2012 by @entity170 , then the @entity172 peace envoy to @entity2 , its terms -- calling for a transitional governing body by mutual consent of all parties , a national dialogue , free elections , and a comprehensive review of the constitution -- hark back to a time when @entity14 seemed weak , the opposition was unified , and the phrase " @entity182 " could be spoken hopefully in the @entity93			1
the major powers that helped forge the @entity66 © , perhaps anticipating @entity14 's fall , refused to place their weight behind it when it mattered			1
@entity170 quit his job in frustration			0
to ordinary @entity2 , the ongoing talks in @entity52 look like a meaningless sideshow			2
@entity25 , feeling triumphant , refuses to go			0
an internally riven opposition refuses to temper its demands			0
the @entity93 , unwilling to intervene militarily and incapable yet of forcing change diplomatically , watches with impotent rage			0
@entity87 , once enfeebled , looks on expectantly			2
@entity2 is now a homicidal theater for a proxy war between @entity111 and @entity101 -- the @entity125 's @entity113 powers			1
a dialogue between the two may do more to halt the fighting in @entity2 than negotiations between @entity14 and his @entity2 adversaries operating from abroad			1
@entity45 's energies are better spent in nudging the two rivals in that direction			0
more immediately , the @entity6 ' ambition should be to end the violence			0
rather than push for @entity14 's departure , it should work toward obtaining a pragmatic power - sharing deal centered on reconciliation rather than regime change			1
finally , it should press its allies in @entity111 and @entity217 to drop their support for radical @entity219			0
if not , the flames that are now devouring @entity2 may soon engulf the @entity93			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			0

@entity223 : in 2012 , from outside @entity2 , it seemed the regime would fall
he says that proved mistaken ; military still backs @entity14
he says the @entity6 goal of an @entity14 *ouster* is unrealistic
he says @entity6 should try to head off @entity87 gains from @entity111 backing of the opposition
