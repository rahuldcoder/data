@entity1 , @entity0 -- after four years and 11 rounds of hard negotiation , the introduction of the " @entity5 " agreement in march was greeted with a sigh of relief			1
this was not just from airlines , but also their passengers			2
if talks in the second phase fail , the entire @entity5 deal could be torn up			1
the deal that allows airlines to fly anywhere in the @entity19 to anywhere in the @entity21 and vice versa promised to increase competition between carriers and possibly cut ticket prices			1
but the relief could be short - lived			0
on thursday , the @entity19 and the @entity21 began talks in @entity28 , @entity29 for the second phase of the deal			1
this time round there 's an even tougher set of issues on the table			0
and if an agreement is not reached by 2011 , either side can pull the plug on the whole deal			1
such a move could be crucial for airlines that have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in preparation for reduced restrictions			2
carriers have added and increased frequency of services , with some paying as much $ 60 million to get their hands on limited @entity49 slots			0
@entity50 will also launch a new business - only airline following the deal between either @entity54 or @entity55 and @entity58 's @entity57 airport this summer			0
one issue the stage - two talks will address is cabitage , or rights for @entity64 airlines to operate domestic @entity21 routes			1
@entity64 critics have said the current deal offers greater advantage to @entity21 carriers by allowing them to operate within the @entity19			1
an @entity21 airline can , for example , fly from @entity58 to @entity1 , where they could pick up passengers and then fly to @entity73			1
but as @entity75 , @entity21 deputy assistant secretary of state for transportation affairs and chief negotiator for @entity5 , explains to @entity2 , this is a red herring in terms of importance in aviation law			1
" not one @entity21 airline has taken advantage of the right because it does n't make commercial sense , " he says			1
" the aircraft that 's right for transatlantic flights is ill - suited for operation within the highly - contested @entity19 market			1
" what 's more , adds @entity91 , editor of @entity92 , there is n't a simple quid pro quo in terms of cabitage			0
as he explains , the @entity19 is not a single market in the same way that the @entity21 is , and the travel patterns on both sides of the @entity100 are different			1
" nobody is really sure what the equivalent right would be in @entity64 for the @entity21 carriers , " he says			1
a more important , and arguably more contentious , issue is around ownership and control			2
@entity21 laws currently cap international ownership to 25 percent of voting stock , and prohibit " actual control " by foreign citizens			1
if these restrictions are removed it could pave the way for transatlantic airline mergers			0
@entity118 , ceo of @entity119 expresses his frustration that airlines are the only companies that can not be owned by foreign buyers in the @entity21 " an airline is no different to a car company or a telephone company , " he says			1
" as long as there are proper competition rules in place , and dominance is not allowed , why does there have to be artificial restriction ? " last august , @entity119 completed a five - year battle to start a low - cost service , @entity134 , in the @entity21			2
the @entity136 company won regulatory approval by agreeing to distance ownership from the @entity139			0
in effect , the @entity119 brand is licensed to an @entity21 - owned company			2
" it took five years for us not own an airline , " he points out			0
yet despite @entity119 's expansion into ventures such as @entity134 as well as @entity149 in @entity150 and @entity151 , the carrier has not yet decided to follow @entity50 ' lead by launching services from other @entity64 capitals following the removal of restrictions under @entity5			2
and considering how tempting a @entity158 to @entity159 , or @entity54 to @entity161 route could be to a non-flag - carrying carrier such as @entity119 , this is significant			0
@entity118 says a time will come for such routes			0
" we need the right aircraft , we need the right market conditions , and we need to make sure that we are fighting the right battle here in our home ground			0
because this is where our strength is , " he says			0
but the other reason for hesitancy comes down to a lack of confidence for phase two of negotiations , he adds			0
@entity75 does n't deny the difficulties and political hurdles negotiators face			0
opening up ownership to foreign companies has implications for homeland security , he explains			0
" we rely on @entity21 airlines to transport our troops and military cargo in time of war of emergency			1
" they must also tread carefully with airline labor unions			0
" there are serious concerns about how to maintain a level playing field if you 've got two unions , one in @entity64 and one in the @entity21 , working for an airline , " he says			2
but signs are that the @entity21 is willing to keep an open mind			2
on tuesday , @entity21 surprised @entity19 negotiators by proposing to drop investment restrictions for airlines for more than 60 countries			1
senior airline executives have also voiced encouragement for an easing of ownership restrictions			0
@entity210 , president of @entity211 told @entity2 : " anything that would open up a freer flow of capital between the @entity19 and @entity21 would be a positive influence			1
" as @entity75 said , the @entity21 is willing to envisage a positive outcome from the outset			2
" we 're committed to working in very good faith and with a lot of energy in the second stage of negotiations to try and reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial			0

the @entity19 and @entity21 have begun talks for phase ii of the @entity5 air transport deal
the hot issue to be debated *revolves* around ownership rights of @entity21 airlines
if talks fail , either side has power to pull the plug on the whole agreement
