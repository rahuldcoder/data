-- @entity1 and @entity2 have often been talked about this year as being part of the next generation of players who can break up the dominance of tennis ' @entity7			2
but judging by his display at the @entity11 , @entity9 could be the most likely candidate			1
@entity9 became only the third men 's player outside @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 to win a grand slam title since early 2005 when he crushed @entity19 6 - 3 6 - 3 6 - 3 in under two hours in @entity20 on monday			1
few , however , would have seen it coming -- last year the 25 - year - old @entity22 did n't play at the season 's final major because he was serving a drug suspension			1
@entity9 felt aggrieved when he received his nine - month ban after testing positive for a banned stimulant he said got into his system accidentally			1
it was later reduced to four months by the @entity31 , which ruled that the initial punishment handed out by the @entity33 was too severe			0
he returned late last year with extra gusto -- and a serve made even better by his charismatic coach , countryman and idol , @entity38			2
@entity38 himself was one of the biggest servers in the history of the men 's game			0
" in this last year my team has brought something special to me , especially goran , " @entity9 , who pocketed $ 3 million , told the crowd			1
" we 're working really hard , but most important of all the things he brought to me was enjoying tennis and always having fun			0
" i think i enjoyed my best tennis over here and i played the best ever in my life			0
" one of the biggest pieces of advice @entity38 gave me this tournament was to not think too much , " he later told @entity56 's @entity55			0
" toss the ball , hit it , play your game , be aggressive			2
" the 6 - foot - 6 @entity9 overpowered @entity14 in the semifinals in straight sets and did the same against the diminutive @entity19 , firing 17 aces and winning 80 % of his first - serve points			1
in the sixth game of the second set , @entity9 hit four straight aces to hold to love			1
and when it was n't his thunderous serve , it was his heavy ground strokes that pinned back his @entity76 opponent			2
while @entity38 won @entity77 in 2001 to send his nation into a frenzy , @entity19 was bidding to become the first @entity81 man to claim a grand slam singles title			1
back at home ahead of the finale , excitement soared to unprecedented levels after @entity19 upset @entity16 in the semifinals			1
replicas of his shirt were sold out , his racket was in high demand and television viewers bought subscriptions in vast numbers to watch the final against @entity9 that began at 6 a.m. in @entity96			1
alas , they were disappointed			0
but the 24 - year - old @entity19 still made history by becoming the first @entity81 man to play in a grand slam singles final			1
remarkably , he did n't know if he would be able to compete in @entity20 this year because he had surgery to remove a cyst from his toe a month ago and missed warmup tournaments in @entity103 and @entity104			1
" he was playing really well today and i could n't play my tennis , " @entity19 told the crowd			1
" it 's a really tough loss but i 'm happy to come into the final			0
" it was a fun two weeks			0
" monday marked the first occasion since the @entity112 that two players in their maiden grand slam final faced off , leading @entity38 to proclaim beforehand that @entity9 and @entity19 would be nervous			1
both began the tournament outside the top 10 , though they 're now in it			0
" they are both climbing to @entity118 , " @entity38 told @entity55			0
" i do n't know who is going to stick the flag , ( a ) @entity76 or @entity22			0
" @entity9 , though , seemed relaxed from the outset			1
he smiled as he walked in the tunnel that led to the biggest court in tennis , during the coin toss and when he took part in the pre-match photo			0
it turns out he was bluffing			0
" the night before i was completely relaxed , " said @entity9			1
" i was feeling that it 's just another match , another day			0
but a couple of hours before the match the nerves started to kick in and i was a bit nervous			0
" i did n't know what to expect on the court			0
" @entity9 -- who entered the encounter with a 2 - 5 record against @entity19 -- nonetheless set the tone by saving a break point in the first game with a fine running forehand cross court			1
whether it was nerves or the different conditions -- it was cooler and slower than when he downed @entity16 -- @entity19 often mistimed his shots in the first set			1
he showed his frustration at 2 - 4 after he struck a short ball that allowed @entity9 to pounce with a forehand			1
@entity19 never did turn things around , finishing with 19 winners and 30 unforced errors			2
@entity9 was broken for the only time as he attempted to close out the second set but then broke straight back to take a two - set lead			2
@entity19 engineered five - set magic against @entity2 and @entity156 in the fourth round and quarterfinals , respectively , but there would be no stretching cilic to five sets			2
@entity156 beat @entity15 to win the @entity162 in january , although the @entity163 was severely hampered by a bad back			0
another break handed @entity9 the lead in the third set and when he fended off three break points in the seventh game , the match was essentially over			2
after double faulting on a first match point -- he tried to finish matters in style with a second - serve ace -- there was no mistaking on the second match point			0
@entity9 ripped a backhand cross-court that gave @entity19 no chance and he collapsed to the court before making his way up to his player box to celebrate			1
the celebrations will intensify when he returns to @entity22			0
" everybody from home was telling me it was a huge day for @entity22 , " @entity9 said			2
" everybody was stuck to the @entity186			0
" a continuation of this form and @entity9 can expect to be celebrating much more in the future .			2
