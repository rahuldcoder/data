brain scans may identify which patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment , or @entity3 , are likely to progress to alzheimer 's disease , and who will probably not develop the disease , according to a new study			1
the findings , published in april 2009 issue of the journal @entity12 , could help in developing new drugs for @entity14 's			1
more than 5 million @entity15 have alzheimer 's disease , about 3.5 million have mild cognitive impairment			0
what did the brain scans show ? dr. @entity20 , @entity21 chief medical correspondent : this was a small but significant study in the fact that it may lead researchers to determine who will develop alzheimer 's disease and who may not			2
i had a chance to view the brain scans used in this study and they were truly fascinating			2
the images of patients with @entity14 's showed many areas throughout the brain where the cells and tissue have begun to deteriorate or have already died			1
we know @entity14 's is a neurodegenerative disease and when the cells die , patients begin to experience loss of cognitive function			1
although all the patients with @entity3 experienced mild memory problems , not affecting their daily life , inside their brains looked very different			0
one group looked very similar to the brain of the @entity14 's patients			1
the other @entity49 showed very little cell damage			0
what does this mean for patients with @entity3 ? @entity20 : what this tells us is no two patients with @entity3 are the same			0
and some may progress to an @entity14 's diagnosis in less that a year			1
these researchers looked at follow - up imaging a year later and found 30 percent of the group whose brains showed signs of cell loss were now @entity14 's patients			1
this is a potential clue in trying to figure out who is most likely to develop @entity14 's later on in life			2
not ready for prime time yet , in terms of patients having access to these scan results , but it could be available a few years from now			0
is there anything people can do as they age to keep their brain strong ? @entity20 : yes , various cognitive exercises and memory activities can help keep your brain healthy and maintain cell production			0
but there is n't a lot of evidence showing that it can somehow reverse the effects of cell loss after getting an @entity14 's diagnosis			1
what i found even more interesting , is something i started to incorporate into my own life : simple physical exercise			0
i am not talking about necessarily strenuous exercise , but simple , regular daily activity			0
studies show it has a way of fueling your brain and even ward off @entity14			2
i would say cognitive and physical activity is your best bet for now .			0

key *structural* changes seen in brain scans of some patients with memory loss
one year later , many patients with brain changes had developed @entity14 's
memory - loss patients without these changes were mostly stable one year later
brain scans could identify who gets @entity14 's , help with drug testing
the bottom line : the average person ca n't run out and get an *mri* that shows if they *'re* on the road to @entity14 's just yet . but these findings could help *drugmakers* as well as patients in the *future* .
