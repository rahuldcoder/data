-- this month , just imagine focused on the future of nature and the ways in which it can inspire solutions to some of the greatest challenges facing humanity today			0
a digital representation of the human genome			2
yet as scientists gain a greater understanding of biological processes , they 're also learning how to manipulate them , including the very essence of what makes us human -- our dna			1
biotechnology advances are already helping scientists find groundbreaking ways to create personalized medicine , detect illnesses and eradicate disease			0
and this , according to futurist @entity24 , is only the beginning			1
in the future , humans will be able to reverse the aging process , replace dying organs with younger ones grown from an individual 's own dna and even genetically engineer unborn children , he said			2
but some , like the @entity35 - based group @entity34 , worry the ability to reprogram our biochemistry could lead mankind into unknown territory with dangerous ramifications for the future , including genetic discrimination and even a redefinition of what it means to be human			1

to what extent should we be able to alter our genetic makeup ? should there be a limit ? and how should it be determined exactly what that limit is ? post your comments in the @entity58 box below			1
we 'll publish the best .			0

we ask , to what extent should we be able to alter our own dna ?
@entity24 : reprogramming dna could *expand* human *potential*
@entity34 says could lead to genetic discrimination , *social* issues
what do you think ? post your views in the @entity58 box below .
