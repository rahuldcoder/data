@entity0 -- the @entity2 will hold its final vote on a sweeping health care bill thursday morning under an agreement that majority leader @entity6 announced tuesday			1
the vote had been expected on the night of @entity8 due to @entity10 delay tactics to hold off the measure			1
@entity6 has insisted it be passed before @entity8			0
@entity6 and @entity2 minority leader @entity13 , @entity14 , decided on a timetable to vote on the health care bill and an extension of the federal debt limit on thursday morning			1
first , the @entity2 will hold another procedural vote on the health care bill wednesday to set up the final vote			1
this procedural vote will require support from all 60 members of @entity6 's @entity26 caucus to overcome a @entity10 filibuster			1
the vote thursday on final passage will need a simple majority of 51 in the 100 - member chamber			1
earlier tuesday , @entity33 cleared the second of the three key procedural hurdles on the sweeping $ 871 billion measure			1
the @entity2 voted 60 - 39 along party lines to adopt changes negotiated by @entity6			1
the @entity2 also set a timetable for ending debate on the bill			1
@entity42 said tuesday he would delay leaving for his @entity8 holiday in @entity44 until the @entity2 holds its final vote on the bill			1
" i will not leave until my friends in the @entity2 have completed their work , " @entity42 said			1
" my attitude is that if they 're making these sacrifices to provide health care to all @entity53 , then the least i can do is be around to provide them any encouragement and last - minute help where necessary			1
" the first procedural vote early monday virtually ensures the bill 's final approval , but any measure the @entity2 passes still would have to be merged with the $ 1 trillion @entity63 version in what could be tough negotiations			1
" health care reform is not a matter of if , " @entity63 press secretary @entity70 said , " health care reform now is a matter of when			1
" sen. @entity71 , @entity72 , chairman of the @entity73 , declared that " the finish line is in sight			0
" " we 're not the first to attempt such reforms , but we will be the first to succeed , " @entity71 said			0
@entity10 have mounted a fierce campaign against the bill , using procedural tricks to slow debate and casting the measure as an unnecessary government intrusion in health care that will raise costs			1
in remarks tuesday on the @entity2 floor , @entity6 acknowledged the toxic political environment surrounding the nearly yearlong debate			1
senators should set aside " personal animosity , " he said			0
" there 's a lot of tension in the @entity2 , but i would hope everyone would go back to their gentlemanly ways			2
... let 's just all try to get along			0
" if a combined @entity63 - @entity2 health care bill wins final approval from @entity102 and @entity42 signs it , the measure would be the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of @entity106 and @entity107 more than four decades ago			1
the influential @entity108 , a traditional opponent of overhauling health care , endorsed the @entity2 measure hours after a rare 1 a.m. monday vote to start winding down debate			1
read @entity1 's dr. @entity114 's take on the health care bill to democrats , monday 's vote signaled eventual victory on the @entity2 bill			1
" the die is cast			0
it 's done , " sen. @entity121 , @entity72 - @entity122 , said			0
watch how deals got the bill moving compromises made to win the backing of lawmakers such as sens. @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity131 , a @entity133 independent , enraged many liberal @entity33 and threatened to undermine support for the bill			2
@entity33 are upset with @entity6 's decision to abandon a government - run public health insurance option and an expansion of @entity106 to @entity53 as young as 55			1
but top democrats argue the @entity2 bill still would constitute a positive change of historic proportions			2
the legislation would extend health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured @entity53 while reducing the federal deficit , according to the @entity146			2
the @entity63 and @entity2 bills agree on a broad range of changes that could affect every @entity53 's coverage			2
among other things , they have agreed to subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $ 88,000 annually , or 400 percent of the federal poverty level			0
watch how the health care overhaul could affect you they also have agreed to create health insurance exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses , the self - employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage			1
both the @entity63 plan and the @entity2 bill eventually would limit total out - of - pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			2
insurers also would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history			0
however , both bills allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for older customers			0
@entity107 would be significantly expanded under both proposals			0
the @entity63 bill would extend coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty level , or roughly $ 33,000 for a family of four ; the @entity2 plan ensures coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level , or just more than $ 29,000 for a family of four			2
major differences between the bills would be the focus of a conference committee that would try to merge them			0
one of the biggest divides is over how to pay for the plans			0
the @entity63 package is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy @entity53 and @entity106 spending reductions			0
specifically , individuals with annual incomes more than $ 500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $ 1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge			0
the @entity2 bill also cuts @entity106 by roughly $ 500 billion			2
but instead of an income tax surcharge on the wealthy , it would impose a 40 percent tax on insurance companies providing what are called " @entity212 " health plans valued at more than $ 8,500 for individuals and $ 23,000 for families			2
proponents of the tax on high - end plans argue it 's one of the most effective ways to curb medical inflation			0
however , @entity63 @entity33 oppose taxing such policies because it would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous health benefits			1
the @entity2 bill also would hike @entity106 payroll taxes on families making more than $ 250,000 ; the @entity63 bill does not			2
another key sticking point is the dispute over a public option			0
the @entity63 plan includes a public option ; the @entity2 plan would instead create new nonprofit private plans overseen by the federal government			2
individuals under both plans would be required to purchase coverage , but the @entity63 bill includes more stringent penalties for most of those who fail to comply			0
the @entity63 bill would impose a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income			0
the @entity2 plan would require individuals to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 or 2 percent of his or her income -- whichever is greater			1
both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer @entity53			0
ireport.com : give your thoughts on the @entity2 health care bill employers face a much stricter mandate under the @entity63 legislation , which would require companies with a payroll of more than $ 500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll			1
the @entity2 bill would require companies with more than 50 employees to pay a fee of up to $ 750 per worker if any of their employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage			2
abortion also has been a sticking point for both chambers			0
a late compromise with @entity276 and other conservatives in the @entity63 led to the adoption of an amendment banning most abortion coverage from the public option			0
it would also prohibit abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies			0
@entity2 provisions , made more conservative than initially drafted to satisfy @entity129 , would allow states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the exchanges			2
individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds			0
@entity1 's @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 contributed to this report .			0
