-- it 's been 19 months since the @entity2 , one of the largest cruise liners ever built , ran aground off the west coast of @entity6 , killing 32 passengers and capsizing after granite rock tore a 50 - meter hole in the ship 's hull			1
now the rotting 952 - foot wreck has been raised from its partially - submerged resting place off the @entity15 island of @entity16 in what engineers say is a risky and unprecedented operation			1
the salvage team used cables attached to hydraulic pumps to rotate the ship upright -- a process known as " parbuckling " -- from the seabed onto a platform , which consists of a series of cement bags and huge under - water steel structure			1
after repairs are made to the previously submerged side of the @entity2 , giant steel " caissons , " or boxes , on the sides of the ship will be pumped full of air and the cruise liner will theoretically float to the surface and be towed to a nearby seaport -- hopefully all in one piece			1
success was anything but guaranteed : engineers had warned they would only have one shot at parbuckling the ship -- and any error during the hours - long process could have seen the ship break apart , or over-rotate off the underwater platforms and sink completely			2
more than 500 people have been working around the clock on the rescue , which is being overseen by @entity53 - based @entity52 and the @entity6 firm @entity54			2
the final bill will be at least $ 400 million , according to the salvage project 's website			1
but the raising of the @entity2 is far from the end of the story			2
the bodies of two passengers are still yet to be retrieved from the wreckage of the $ 570 million ship , which was carrying more than 4,200 passengers and crew when it struck the granite rocks off @entity16 on january 13 , 2012			1
even after the parbuckling and the repairs to the starboard side of the 114,500 - ton vessel , the salvage crew will still have to wait for winter to pass before it can be towed to a nearby seaport to be taken apart			0
it could also take years to fully restore @entity16 's pristine waters and marine life to their previous state			0
the island is part of the @entity80 , the largest protected marine area in the @entity81			0
five members of the @entity2 's staff were sentenced in july to short prison terms for their roles in the disaster			0
@entity87 , the ship 's captain , is being tried separately on charges of manslaughter , causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship			0
his trial is set to resume in late september			0
@entity0 's @entity95 and @entity96 contributed to this report .			0

wreck of the @entity2 , one of the largest cruise ships ever built , raised from sea bed
952 - foot ship ran aground in january 2012 on @entity15 island of @entity16 , killing 32 passengers
unprecedented operation involves more than 500 workers , will cost at least $ 400 million
raising of @entity2 is only first phase -- ship must then be *dismantled* at nearby port
