@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was no ordinary football match tuesday in the capital of @entity1 , in @entity5			1
partisan fans crowded the stands and players in colorful jerseys competed on the field at @entity11			0
one team was comprised of retired players from the @entity14			0
the other team was unusual , made up of members of the ruling @entity17 ( @entity17 ) ; the primary opposition party , the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) ; and the @entity20 ( @entity20 )			0
the game was dubbed " @entity22 2013			0
" its purpose : a show of unity , and a cooling of tensions , two days before the @entity1 @entity26 rules on a sweeping challenge to the december 2012 presidential election			1
the famously easy - going people of @entity1 are on edge , awaiting thursday 's decision			1
the drama pits incumbent president @entity37 of the @entity17 against his main challenger , @entity38 of the @entity19			1
the @entity20 declared @entity37 the winner of the december 2012 presidential election with 50.7 % of the vote , narrowly avoiding a runoff			1
he was sworn into office in january			2
the @entity17 has acknowledged there were some irregularities , but contends they were minimal			0
but @entity38 and two other @entity19 officials sued , alleging widespread mismanagement and voting irregularities at more than 10,000 polling stations , and are asking the @entity26 to annul millions of votes			1
the @entity19 maintains @entity38 should have won the presidency			0
analysts say the court has three choices : it could throw out all the @entity19 's election challenges and validate @entity57 's election			2
it could uphold some or all of the @entity19 allegations , triggering a recount without the disputed votes and realigning the percentages , putting @entity37 or @entity38 in the presidency if one or the other tallies 50 % +1 or more			1
or it could call an entirely new election			2
no one seems ready to confidently predict what the court will do			0
nine @entity26 justices spent 48 days hearing the case , which has riveted the nation			1
the proceedings were broadcast live on @entity1 television and radio , the first time the court has allowed such broadcasts			1
they have been immensely popular			0
" @entity1 are very politically drunk , " says @entity81 and @entity82 presenter and @entity83 tribal chieftain @entity79			1
" we all thought it would be a two - week case			0
so when it started , everyone was glued to the tele and the radio and every dial was on the court			0
" across the capital , calls for post-decision calm and national unity are on billboards , banners , across the airwaves and in published statements from both parties and a host of political and social groups			1
@entity37 and @entity38 were to meet to mutually call for calm and respect for the decision , whatever way it goes			1
@entity1 is one of @entity5 's fastest - growing economies			1
it is the world 's second - largest cocoa producer , after @entity111 , and the continent 's second biggest gold miner , after @entity114 , according to the @entity115			0
but critics say that despite the rich resources that bring billions of dollars annually , the wealth is not trickling down to the rural poor who live on the land where the gold is mined			0
@entity1 has been largely free of election bloodshed there is a lot at stake thursday			1
in march 1957 , @entity1 became the first @entity128 @entity127 colony to declare independence from a colonial ruler , in its case , @entity132			2
it endured four military coups in the first 14 years , after one of which , three former presidents were executed			0
then , in the election of 2000 , it had its first peaceful transfer of power between civilian presidents			2
the incumbent won a second term in 2004 , but term limits prohibited him from seeking a third term in 2008			0
in that election , @entity144 of the @entity17 narrowly defeated @entity38			0
but @entity146 died in office last year , elevating his vice president , @entity37 to the presidency			1
last december , @entity37 ran for a full term against @entity38 , setting off the @entity26 battle			1
the decision and how @entity1 react to it is significant far beyond its borders			1
unlike its neighbors , @entity1 has held successful elections and power transfers since 1992 without descending into bloody chaos			2
just next door , @entity111 's 2010 presidential election led to a bloody conflict that left some 3,000 people dead			1
in @entity163 , a coup last year opened an opportunity for @entity166 insurgents to capture much of the north , leading to a @entity169 invasion			0
@entity170 and @entity171 have had bloody civil wars			0
but @entity1 has seen none of that violence , particularly in recent years			2
although @entity1 's 25 million people represent more than eight tribes and while predominently @entity177 , has more than 4 million @entity166 , it has no history of partisan or religious violence			2
experts credit @entity1 's system of sending high school students to boarding schools in other parts of the country for their education , which exposes @entity1 to other communities and cultures , for creating tolerance and cooperation			1
for many @entity1 , the reaction to thursday 's ruling will test that			2
but most think the reaction will be peaceful			0
if that happens , @entity79 says he hopes it will resonate across the continent			0
" i think it would be an extremely good message and that all leaders should look at and by all means emulate , " @entity79 says , " because as a continent i think we 've done ourselves in too long , mostly because of political disagreement			0
so if we can take this to the @entity26 and we can accept it , i think the other 52 or 53 nations should look up to it say this is the way forward			2
" there is one thing @entity79 predicts with confidence			0
when the @entity26 convenes on thursday and the live nationwide television and radio broadcasts go on air , " i think 98 % of @entity1 will be glued to it			1

@entity1 @entity26 set to rule on **massive** presidential election challenge
decision could remove president @entity37 from office
calls for calm and unity sweeping @entity5 country
