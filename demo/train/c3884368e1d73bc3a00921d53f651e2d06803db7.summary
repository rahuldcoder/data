-- most guys pull them on every morning when they step out of the shower			0
in fact , at this very moment , there 's probably nothing closer to you than your underwear			1
it 's taken thousands of years to perfect the boxers or briefs that you 're wearing right now , though , so here 's a brief and incomplete look at the history of men 's underwear : loincloths offer some coverage the first known underwear dates back almost 7000 years , when prehistoric man used leather to cover and protect his loins while running prehistoric errands			1
for several millennia , not much changed			0
ancient @entity26 art shows everyone from the pharaohs on down the line decked out in loincloths of their own			0
the pharaohs even wore a sort of specialized kilt / loincloth called a shendoh , and took extra supplies of the garment into their pyramids for use in the afterlife			0
codpieces become all the rage variations on the loincloth seem to have persisted into the @entity45 , when loose - fitting trousers called braies came into fashion			1
these linen duds extended from the waist to around mid-calf , and once the wearer stepped into his breeches he had to lace them tight around his waist and shins			0
although all of the tying was n't so convenient , these braies had the advantage of offering a lot of coverage , so if a laborer got too hot he could strip down to his skivvies while still maintaining some sense of decorum			1
on the other hand , all of the lacing and cinching made answering nature 's call a bit of a hassle			1
a codpiece that opened at the front using buttons , snaps , or laces enabled men to urinate without removing their braies , which really came in handy when you 'd had a bit too much mead			1
@entity0 : 6 articles of clothing that caused riots these early codpieces were practical , but as hemlines rose , they started to take on a decorative function , too			0
when @entity91 began to pad his codpiece in the 16th century , all of his loyal subjects followed suit			1
( nevermind that scholars later speculated that @entity91 's bulging codpiece may not have actually been male overcompensation -- it may have been oversized to accommodate medication - soaked bandages to alleviate some of the pain from a suspected case of syphilis			1
it 's worth noting that modern scholars have mostly dismissed this theory			2
) @entity105 padding and growth continued throughout the mid-sixteenth century before tailing off around 1590			1
prizefighters get stretchy " boxers or briefs ? " before the 1920s , this question would have gotten you little more than a blank look , mostly because neither boxers nor briefs had been invented yet			2
from @entity118 times into the 1930s , men had mostly worn tight - fitting knee - length flannel " drawers " beneath their pants and donned similarly snug flannel tops as undershirts			2
this state of affairs does n't sound too comfy , but things got a little more breathing room in 1925			0
@entity128 , the founder of the venerable boxing equipment company @entity129 , started to tweak designs for the trunks worn by pugilists			0
@entity128 realized that the leather - belted trunks fighters had been wearing were n't totally ideal , so he replaced the leather with more flexible elastic waistbands			2
boxer shorts were n't an immediate success as underwear , though			2
they lacked the support that drawers and union suits had offered , so men were n't crazy about them			2
it really was n't until after @entity145 that boxer shorts took off to challenge their younger siblings , the briefs			0
@entity0 : a brief history of shaving postcard ispires tighty whities underwear drawers changed forever in 1934 when @entity153 , an executive and designer at the @entity156 hosiery company @entity155 , received a postcard from a friend who was visiting the @entity159			2
the postcard depicted a man in a bikini - style bathing suit , and " apparel engineer " @entity153 had an epiphany : could n't this type of swimsuit be converted into underwear ? after some experimentation , @entity153 introduced a new kind of snug , legless underwear with an overlapping y - front fly			2
@entity155 dubbed the new product " jockey shorts " because the high level of support the garment offered was reminiscent of jockstraps			0
@entity178 took its first batch of @entity181 briefs to @entity184 's landmark department store @entity182 on january 19 , 1935			2
although the weather was awful ? @entity184 was in the grip of a blizzard ? the entire load of 600 pairs of jockeys sold out on the first day			0
within three months , the company sold 30,000 pairs of @entity181 shorts			0
@entity178 kept making and marketing its wildly successful underwear , and in 1971 the company changed its name to @entity181			0
@entity198 gives @entity199 a boost designer underwear became all the rage in the 1970s and 80s as labels like @entity204 began to transform our drawers from something we hid under our pants into the sort of fashion and lifestyle choice one could flaunt in a bad music video			1
cuts became tighter and sexier , and underwear designs became flashy , loud , and often humorous			0
one of the main beneficiaries of this new obsession with snappy underwear was @entity199 , which started making skivvies in 1984 when it filled an order for @entity220 's that included a design with a @entity223 - attached removable raccoon tail			1
@entity199 really jumped into the spotlight in 1985 , though , when it made boxers printed with the image of hundred - dollar bills			1
the @entity198 decided that these duds violated forgery laws and confiscated 1,000 pairs of the offending underwear			0
instead of simply hiring lawyers , @entity199 turned the seizure into a lighthearted news event , and the image of boxers as a playful alternative to stolid briefs grew			0
@entity0 : symbolism and the $ 1 bill underwear takes the nation 's economic pulse although there have n't been many huge underwear breakthroughs since the introduction of boxer briefs in the early 1990s ( and even those are sort of a throwback to the union suits favored by pre- 1930s men ) , boxers and briefs found their way onto the financial pages in early 2008			1
that 's when former @entity258 chairman @entity257 revealed that the state of the men 's underwear industry is an important indicator of the economy 's health			1
the logic @entity257 outlined regarding underwear was both simple and elegant			0
most guys have a drawer full of fairly ratty underwear that they 'll wear until the elastic is dead and the boxers are riddled with holes			1
since coworkers and friends generally do n't see a guy 's underwear , replacing these frayed undergarments often seems like a discretionary purchase for men			1
as such , when men start fearing the economy is in a downturn and need a place to save a little cash , they simply stop replenishing their underwear drawer with fresh jockeys			1
sounds reasonable enough , right ? sure enough , when the economy started to tail off in 2008 , annual men 's underwear sales dropped by 12 percent			1
