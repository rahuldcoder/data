@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 has recently blasted the influx of money from undisclosed donors flowing into the midterm campaigns			1
he repeated a claim , which major media outlets have not been able to substantiate , that foreign funds may have been used in the @entity11			0
at a recent rally in @entity14 , @entity15 , the president said " @entity11 people deserve to know who is trying to sway their elections			2
" " you do n't know : it could be the oil industry			0
it could even be foreign - owned corporations			0
you do n't know because they do n't have to disclose			0
" in making these attacks @entity3 is returning to a central theme that animated his 2008 campaign : the need to change the campaign finance system			1
as a candidate , @entity3 railed against the way that money influenced politics			1
he reiterated a long - standing theme of reform - candidates that unless the political process changed , policies would remain the same and @entity11 would never gain confidence in their government			2
but @entity3 broke from these principles almost as soon as he made the argument			2
during the campaign , @entity3 disappointed many campaign reform advocates when he announced that he would not use public funds in the general election campaign so that he could raise an unlimited amount of money in his race against sen. @entity47			1
in 2004 , president @entity48 and sen. @entity49 dealt a blow to the public finance system when they did n't use public funds in their primary election campaigns			1
but @entity3 took this decision a step further , rendering one of the more successful @entity59 - era reforms ineffective			2
ironically , when he announced his decision he said , " if we do n't stand together , the broken system we have now , a system where special interests drown out the voices of the @entity11 people will continue to erode our politics and prevent the possibility of real change			0
that 's why we must act			0
the stakes are higher than ever , and people are counting on us			0
" his campaign then raised an unprecedented amount of money , much of which came from large donors			1
after starting his presidency , @entity3 showed minimal interest in reform			1
he left the " broken system " alone			0
@entity3 shelved substantive campaign reform proposals as he turned his attention to the economic crisis , health care reform and the wars in @entity87 and @entity88			1
@entity3 's actions followed a pattern of candidates running on campaign finance reform as an issue , then putting it aside once they get into office			1
who wants to anger powerful interest groups and donors right before taking on their policy agenda ? the president 's plate , moreover , was so full from day one that it was a lot to ask him to take on something as charged as campaign finance			1
nonetheless , at the moment when the president arguably had the most political capital to move forward with an issue as difficult as campaign finance reform , @entity3 succumbed to these familiar and predictable fears			1
there have been a few exceptional moments when presidents acted differently			0
in 1978 , for instance , president @entity113 followed through on his promise to try to clean up government in the wake of @entity59			0
he supported legislation that created stricter ethics rules for executive branch officials and established the @entity121 to investigate alleged corruption			0
while the reforms turned out to be flawed and produced numerous unintended consequences , @entity113 's actual choice in 1978 marked an unusual moment when a president took reform seriously			2
@entity113 's reform built on the historic campaign finance reforms that @entity131 passed in 1974			1
not only did @entity3 downplay campaign finance reform , but he subsequently embraced a legislative strategy that depended on cutting deals with powerful interest groups such as the pharmaceutical industry so that lobbyists would " buy into " legislation rather than oppose it			1
the strategy worked politically with health care reform although , according to @entity144 's recent account in @entity145 , it weakened the chances for passing climate change legislation through the @entity148			0
the @entity151 's @entity150 decision was certainly damaging to reform efforts			0
so too were many other factors , such as @entity155 decisions and tax laws that have allowed donors to contribute large amounts of funds without disclosure			0
president @entity3 , however , certainly should n't claim to be an innocent bystander			1
while he has pushed for significant lobbying and transparency reforms , the major reform groups concluded in january 2010 that the " @entity3 administration has not pursued public policy reforms in the campaign finance area			1
" both parties have stood silent as the nation 's campaign finance system erodes			1
at best they have supported relatively mild reforms like the @entity174 legislation , that have left huge holes for money to flow into the system -- and which was weakened by another @entity151 decision in 2006			2
according to @entity181 of the nonprofit group @entity182 , " this is a low point for the campaign finance reform movement -- i 've never seen it lower			1
" this a difficult challenge given that the conservative majority on the @entity151 is clearly hostile toward reform			0
but the president and @entity131 must consider stronger regulatory mechanisms and the possibility of restoring a system of public finance for campaigns			2
until presidents and congressional leaders decide to make campaign finance reform a priority issue the relationship between money and politics wo n't change			1
this is unfortunate since the way that politics works profoundly influences the type of policies that government can produce			0
the power of money in politics was there for all to see when interest groups were able to gut key cost control measures during the health care debate			0
like most presidents before him , both @entity212 and @entity213 , @entity3 is now witnessing the consequences of accepting the status quo , and the flow of money is only likely to grow			2
as @entity219 , a former general counsel for the @entity220 told the @entity221 , " this year is practice for 2012			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

president @entity3 is *criticizing* influx of campaign money from undisclosed donors
@entity224 says @entity3 campaigned in 2008 for finance reform
once in office , president dropped the issue to focus on other things , @entity224 says
@entity3 chose to live within existing system rather than reform it , he says
