-- the @entity1 is extending its reach into video and voice calling with the release of a @entity7 app for the mobile gaming device			1
the free app is expected to be available through the playstation store tuesday in @entity11 and wednesday in @entity12 and @entity13			1
it will work for both the @entity1 's @entity16 and @entity17 only models			1
the @entity7 app will use the @entity1 's front and rear cameras for video calling			1
the app will also run in " background mode , " so users can pause a game , and then take a call			0
there is no functionality at this time to continue playing a game while taking a call			0
since it runs in " background mode , " @entity7 will also alert users to calls when the @entity1 is in sleep mode			2
no word yet on how it will affect the device 's five to six hours of battery time			0
on the @entity7 blog , legendary gamer @entity37 ( @entity37 ) shows off the features of the new app. the @entity1 already has voice chat and text chat through its built - in party application			1
however , developer @entity44 , president of @entity45 , told @entity0 in february that there were restrictions to that voice chat by broadband providers ( only one person can be on a 3g connection )			0
" the @entity1 is n't a phone , " he said			0
it appears that the @entity7 app may be trying to change that			2
do gamers really want to be bothered during a " @entity57 " gun battle by a call from a friend ? or is this a partial admission by @entity62 that a dedicated games - only device may not be what users want ?			0
