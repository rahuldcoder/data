-- eight women and four men convened regularly over 13 months			0
they heard from dozens of witnesses , considered 30,000 pieces of evidence			0
all of it with one question in mind : who killed 6 - year - old @entity10 ? on october 13 , 1999 -- nearly three years after the diminutive @entity14 pageant queen 's body was found in her home -- the 12 grand jurors went back to their own homes , sworn to silence and with nothing apparently to show for their effort			1
" we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges , " then - @entity22 district attorney @entity21 said			2
the presumption was that the grand jury had n't voted to indict anyone			1
that included failing to take action against @entity10 's parents , @entity32 and @entity33 , whom @entity22 police had said were under " an umbrella of suspicion " in the girl 's death			1
yet the @entity38 , the newspaper in that @entity14 city , now says there was more to the story			2
citing several unidentified jurors as well as an assistant district attorney in @entity21 's office , the paper reports that the grand jury did , in fact , vote to indict the @entity49 parents on charges of child abuse resulting in death			1
" we did n't know who did what , " one juror told the @entity38 , " but we felt the adults in the house may have done something that they certainly could have prevented , or they could have helped her , and they did n't			0
" " @entity64 saying that they as a grand jury did not know what happened , " retorted @entity61 , an @entity62 attorney who has represented the @entity63 over the years			1
his comments came on @entity0 tuesday after being asked to respond to what the anonymous juror told the paper			2
@entity61 said the grand jury was " likely confused			1
" @entity21 , the man who presented the case to them , did n't sign the indictment , however , the @entity38 reports			0
paper : @entity77 voted in ' 99 to indict parents of @entity10 , @entity76 did n't sign on it 's a decision that @entity80 , a former prosecutor who was n't directly involved in the grand jury proceedings , confirmed to the paper and said makes sense			1
" the state of the evidence in that case was simply inadequate to file a charge , in my opinion , and that obviously was @entity21 's opinion , too , " @entity80 said			0
" whether it 's against one or two people , you just did n't have the evidence			0
" @entity61 called @entity21 a " hero			1
" " @entity94 and @entity33 had been told back in ' 99 by their attorneys they should expect to be indicted , " he said			2
" you have to go back 15 , 16 years to remember there was a media frenzy of false accusations against this family			0
there was an incompetent and prejudiced @entity103 investigation , the investigation that focused on day one on the @entity49 family and refused to follow the evidence that would have led to the killer of this child			0
" they ( the @entity63 ) expected that they would be indicted and they expected they would have their names cleared in front of a judge or a jury , " @entity61 said			1
the attorney pointed to the 2008 findings from then - district attorney @entity115 that dna tests ruled out any @entity49 family member 's involvement in the girl 's death			2
" the dna tests performed after the time of the @entity22 grand jury not only prove the @entity49 family to be innocent and the grand jury wrong , they also make former district attorney @entity21 a hero who wisely avoided a gross miscarriage of justice , " @entity61 told @entity0 in an interview monday			1
those now in the @entity22 district attorney 's office are n't commenting on the report in the @entity38 , spokeswoman @entity129 said monday			1
@entity133 : ' there 's a killer on the loose ' it was december 26 , 1996 -- a day after @entity10 got a bicycle as a @entity139 gift -- when @entity33 said she discovered a three - page ransom note in her @entity22 home			1
police came and , later that day , found @entity10 's beaten and strangled body in the family 's basement			1
days after burying the girl in suburban @entity62 , where they had previously lived , the @entity63 appeared on @entity0			1
" there 's a killer on the loose , " @entity33 said january 1 , 1997 , in an interview that brought an intense national spotlight on the case			2
" i do n't know who it is			0
i do n't know if it 's a she or a he , but if i were a resident of @entity22 , i would tell my friends to keep your babies close to you			1
there 's someone out there			0
" the parents insisted an intruder committed the crime , but no one was caught and no description was given			0
in time , the focus turned on the parents : could they have done it ? investigators did n't find any sign of forced entry			0
a paintbrush from her mother 's hobby kit was used to tighten the rope that choked @entity10			2
and the alleged ransom note was written from paper inside the house and referenced little - known details about the family 's past and its finances			0
despite the suspicions , the @entity63 were never named as suspects			0
but they were a focus of the grand jury , which first convened in september 1998			1
on monday , @entity0 talked with one juror and another 's spouse , both of whom indicated that -- at the behest of the district attorney 's office -- they would not discuss the case			0
messages left by @entity0 with several other jurors were not immediately answered			0
but according to @entity80 and several jurors who talked with the @entity38 , the decision was eventually made to indict @entity32 and @entity33			1
this was even though the jurors were n't sure who , exactly , had killed young @entity10			1
16 years later , still no arrests or charges according to @entity80 , who worked as a prosecutor for 28 years before retiring , there was disagreement among the eight or so involved in the prosecution about what to do after the grand jury voted to indict			1
he told the @entity38 that he thinks his former boss did the right thing not pressing forward with the case , arguing that the evidence did n't show whether @entity33 or @entity49 may have been more directly responsible			1
" if i were on a jury , i would not convict either of them , " said @entity80			0
as is , while there have been many twists and turns since the grand jury was discharged in 1999 , there 's been no closure			1
the @entity63 were busy in march 2000 , releasing their book " the death of @entity228 , " filing multimillion - dollar lawsuits against media organizations who they say libeled their son ( who was 9 at the time of @entity10 's death ) and settling a lawsuit with a tabloid newspaper			2
that may , the @entity63 returned to @entity0 to face off with @entity238 , a former @entity22 police detective who 'd released a book of his own			2
@entity238 claimed the girl died after " an explosive encounter " over a bed - wetting incident , something the @entity63 fiercely denied			0
the district attorney 's office , then led by @entity115 , took over the case from @entity22 police in 2002			2
four years later , there was an apparent breakthrough with the arrest of 41 - year - old teacher @entity10 in @entity251 , @entity252			2
this came after he freely -- and repeatedly -- said he was with @entity10 the night she died , although he insisted her death was an accident and that he " loved " her			2
but soon after his arrest and return to @entity14 , prosecutors announced dna evidence proved @entity10 had nothing to do with @entity10 's death			1
that same year , 2006 , @entity33 died at the age of 49 following a fight with ovarian cancer			0
then came @entity115 's 2008 letter to @entity49 , exonerating him and the rest of his family after tests of dna evidence found in the girl 's underwear and beneath her fingernails			0
" to the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime , i am deeply sorry , " @entity115 wrote			0
since then , authorities have said they 'd continued to try to find answers			0
but despite their work , the case remains as cold as it was on that late december day , 16 years ago .			0

@entity62 lawyer @entity61 : comments given to @entity22 paper show grand jury did n't know truth
he called @entity76 a " hero " for not indicting @entity32 and @entity33 for the 1996 death of @entity10
the little girl was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her @entity14 home
