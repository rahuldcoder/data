@entity1 is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten @entity3			2
its @entity49 includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s			0
if it works , astronauts will land on the asteroid , take samples and bring them back to @entity3 .			0

@entity17 will fly " very close " to @entity3 on sunday
@entity3 's not in *danger* , @entity1 says , but the flyby will give scientists something to study
