@entity0 -- the @entity3 succeeded in its effort to shoot down an inoperable spy satellite before it could crash to @entity6 and potentially release a cloud of toxic gas , the @entity2 said wednesday			1
a @entity10 rocket lifts off , carrying a reconnaissance satellite that failed hours later			2
the first opportunity for the @entity3 to shoot down the satellite came about 10:30 p.m. et wednesday			0
the plan included firing a missile from the @entity16 in the @entity17 west of @entity18 to destroy the satellite			0
" a network of land - , air - , sea - and space - based sensors confirms that the @entity24 military intercepted a non-functioning @entity26 satellite which was in its final orbits before entering the @entity6 's atmosphere , " a @entity2 statement said			1
" at approximately 10:26 p.m. est today , a @entity24 @entity30 warship , the @entity16 , fired a single modified tactical @entity31 , hitting the satellite approximately 247 kilometers ( 133 nautical miles ) over the @entity17 as it traveled in space at more than 17,000 mph			1
" it was unknown whether the missile hit its precise target -- the satellite 's full fuel tank			1
the @entity2 said it would n't know for certain for 24 hours whether the fuel tank had been hit			1
however , several defense officials told @entity42 the missile did apparently destroy the fuel tank			1
watch a report on the successful shootdown » " @entity46 will begin to re-enter the @entity6 's atmosphere immediately , " the department said			1
" nearly all of the debris will burn up on re-entry within 24 - 48 hours and the remaining debris should re-enter within 40 days			1
" however , even if the missile did n't score a direct hit , " any kind of hit provides a much better outcome than doing nothing at all , " adm. @entity52 , chairman of the @entity53 , told reporters at @entity61 , @entity18			2
the missile did n't carry a warhead , with authorities saying the impact was expected to be sufficient to destroy the fuel tank			1
@entity3 gunners had just a 10 - second window to fire , and officials had said they might not be able to take their shot on the first opportunity			0
earlier wednesday , officials had expressed concern about weather conditions , saying the launch could be delayed			0
however , the 10 - second window would have occurred on each of the next nine or 10 days			2
watch @entity2 spokesman @entity78 describe the launch window » officials had said the missile would not be fired until the space shuttle @entity83 landed , which it did wednesday morning , to ensure the shuttle would not be struck by any debris from the destroyed satellite			1
the attempt cost up to $ 60 million , according to estimates			0
without intervention , officials say , the satellite would have fallen to @entity6 on its own in early march			0
however , since it malfunctioned immediately after it was launched in december 2006 , it had a full tank -- about 1,000 pounds -- of frozen , toxic hydrazine propellant			2
watch how the failing satellite failed to spark fears » the fuel tank probably would have survived re-entry if the satellite had fallen to @entity6 on its own			1
that could have dispersed harmful or even potentially deadly fumes over an area the size of two football fields			0
hydrazine is similar to chlorine or ammonia in that it affects the lungs and breathing tissue			0
the @entity112 military destroyed an aging weather satellite last year , prompting questions about whether the @entity24 is merely flexing its muscle to show an economic and military rival that it can destroy satellites , too			1
@entity119 , deputy national security adviser , denied that this week , saying , " this is all about trying to reduce the danger to human beings			0
" but @entity123 appears to have doubts			0
" @entity112 is continuing to closely follow the possible harm caused by the @entity24 action to outer space security and relevant countries , " @entity126 spokesman @entity125 said thursday			1
" @entity112 further requests that the @entity24 ... promptly provide to the international community the necessary information ... so that relevant countries can take precautions			1
" in 1989 , a @entity24 fighter jet destroyed a @entity24 satellite by firing a modified air - to - air missile into space from an altitude of 80,000 feet			2
that adds to evidence that the @entity24 acted wednesday strictly to guard against the prospect of a potential disaster , said gen. @entity145 , vice chairman of the @entity53			2
the military timed its shootdown attempt so that resulting debris would tumble into the atmosphere and not interfere with other satellites , said @entity151 , a @entity24 diplomat and expert on disarmament			1
her comments were included in an online @entity156 report on this month 's @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159			0
see dangers and possible solutions to satellite problem » the military also timed its efforts to minimize the chances that debris would hit populated areas			2
but the @entity24 is " prepared to offer assistance to governments to mitigate the consequences of any satellite debris impacts on their territory , " according to a report of @entity151 's remarks on the web site of the @entity158 office of the @entity156 one @entity2 official said that since early january , a team including 200 industry experts and scientists had worked furiously to modify the @entity182 air - defense missile system so it could shoot down the satellite			1
among the team 's challenges was modifying the sensors designed to detect the heat from an incoming warhead , as the satellite will be much cooler			0
the missile was to release a " kinetic kill vehicle , " enabling it to " see " the satellite and adjust its course toward it if necessary , officials said			0
in january 2007 , @entity112 used a land - based missile to destroy a 2,200 - pound satellite that was orbiting 528 miles above the @entity6			2
the impact left more than 100,000 pieces of debris orbiting the planet , @entity197 estimated -- 2,600 of them more than 4 inches across			0
the @entity24 agency called the breakup of the @entity206 satellite the worst in history			2

new : @entity112 asks @entity24 to provide information so " countries can take precautions "
@entity2 : most debris will burn up on re-entry within two days
the remaining debris should re-enter the atmosphere within 40 days
@entity2 wo n't know for certain for 24 hours whether fuel tank was hit
