-- growing up in @entity1 , @entity2 was an automatic @entity4 fan , and going to @entity5 was akin to a religious experience , with observed rituals			1
" i would always order a sausage outside @entity5 and wait for batting practice homers to fly over the ' @entity11 , ' " said @entity2 , author of " @entity8 : a fan 's guide to @entity14 " and " 101 @entity15			1
" now , he goes about the stadium experience a little differently			2
the only hard and fast rule for @entity2 : never leave early			2
staying until the very last out , like his father taught him , has created memories @entity2 will never forget			0
he will always cherish seeing the @entity22 - driven @entity4 come back in the ninth inning on @entity24 1998 , but he 'd like to erase that time the @entity4 lost to the @entity25 , 22 - 1			1
below , @entity2 shares his favorite stadiums and why you should take in a game at one of these parks			1
@entity5 , @entity31 it comes with the territory of being a @entity4 fan			1
" i spent my summers making journeys into @entity5 as early as 5 years old with my father , later with my college friends and then with my wife , " @entity2 said			1
" i 'm prone to favoring older parks , and i love @entity5 for that classic ballpark experience			1
" but @entity2 claims he does n't let his team allegiance cloud his stadium judgment			0
" before i 'm a @entity4 fan , i 'm a baseball fan			2
" @entity44 , @entity45 by rights , @entity2 should n't like anything associated with the @entity25			2
but their updated stadium is worthy of admiration , no matter what team colors you bleed			0
" they really did an incredible job with that place , " @entity2 said			0
" they spent $ 1.5 billion , which to me was inconceivable , but it looks amazing			0
it 's really a palace			0
the façade outside is incredible , and all of the fan amenities and the sightlines are great			0
" @entity65 , @entity66 a fan of old - time parks rich with history , tradition and baseball lore , @entity2 enjoys the ivy - covered walls of @entity65 for the traditional experience the stadium offers fans			1
like with @entity5 , taking in a game at @entity65 is a must for any baseball fan , just for the honor of sitting in the 98 - year - old stadium			1
@entity81 , @entity82 a newer stadium built in @entity82 in the early ' 90s , @entity81 brings together the best of the classic and modern baseball worlds in @entity2 's book			1
" there 's something to be said for the so - called retroclassic ballparks that try to capture the aesthetics of the old - time yards but meld them with the fan conveniences and modern amenities that people expect , " @entity2 said			1
" this is the one that started the whole trend away from the multipurpose cookie - cutter stadiums and toward the baseball - specific old - time yards			1
" @entity102 , @entity103 @entity2 likes @entity102 for its potential as a stage for baseball history , along with the current @entity108 roster			1
" it 's kind of a dark horse , and it 's a small park , " @entity2 said			0
" but if the @entity108 can have a contending team , i think it 's a park that could get the credit it deserves for being pretty well - done			2
" exploring baseball lore if the history of the game is what captivates you most , go on your own treasure hunt for the relics of former stadiums			2
@entity2 recommends these three quirky locations			0
venture onto the @entity126 campus to relive a moment of baseball glory			2
although @entity133 has been replaced with academic buildings , the brick wall where @entity131 's famous home run beat the @entity25 in the @entity132 still stands , field markers indicating the feet markings of the outfield			0
home plate remains in its original spot , ensconced in the floor beneath glass			0
if you 're enjoying a day at the amusement park within the @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity146 , look up high next to the log ride			0
yes , that 's a stadium chair mounted on the wall , in its original location from when the @entity152 ' @entity151 hit the longest home run in old @entity155 history			0
in the early 1900s , when the @entity157 were known as the @entity158 , they played in @entity159			0
" there 's still a nice stretch of the old façade standing at the front of the stadium and the ticket office , " @entity2 said			0
" from the big league parks to the minor league parks to the now - abandoned parks that are standing in part , there are so many wonderful baseball sites out there , " @entity2 said			1
" each one , from the nicest brand - new park to the most decrepit minor league yard out there , they all give me a special tingle when i walk through the ballpark gates			2
