@entity0 , @entity1 -- few people in the world have the chance to see a former pet orangutan released back into the wild and it was about to happen right in front of me			1
we were with the @entity13 orangutan team deep in the @entity15 jungle at the site where @entity18 the endangered @entity15 orangutan was to be released			1
i was standing with the @entity2 team about 10 feet from the orangutan 's crate , watching in anticipation as an @entity24 man was standing on top about to open it			1
he lifted one wall of the crate and @entity18 slowly walked out			0
the orangutan was very calm as he exited the crate			1
the first thing he did was look over to where we were standing			0
that also happened to be the direction where our tech expert @entity38 had placed our gopro camera just a few feet away			0
it was an incredible sight and a great shot			0

@entity1 director @entity48 warned us not to get too close to the 11 - year - old male orangutan			1
sumatran orangutans can be very strong and unpredictable			0
we had no idea what to expect			0
did we make him feel threatened ? would he charge a group of onlookers with cameras ? luckily for us , the answer was no. he turned away from us and walked into the jungle			1
the islands of @entity0 and @entity60 are the only two places on earth where wild orangutans roam free			1
it 's illegal to have one as a pet because it 's an endangered species , but they 're sold on the black market for thousands of dollars			1
pet orangutans are hunted and captured as very small babies from remote areas of the rainforest			0
it 's a brutal process			1
mother orangutans often fight to protect their babies , like any mother would , so the mother is often killed in the process			1
it 's a cruel way to get a cute pet for only a few years			1
most orangutans are too much for people to handle as they grow into adolescence , so the owners seldom keep their pets			0
that 's exactly what happened to @entity18			1
he was five years old when his owner gave him up			0
@entity18 was then brought to @entity48 and his team at the @entity13			1

so the @entity13 team has to erase all the captive behavior the orangutan learned as a pet and replace it with wild orangutan behavior			1
it takes many years to individually model this behavior to these orangutans to replicate the lessons that a mother orangutan would 've taught her baby			2
each orangutan has to learn everything from finding food to climbing a tree			2
climbing is very important for @entity15 orangutans			0
they share the same habitat as @entity15 tigers , so to keep from becoming a tiger 's dinner , orangutans must live most of their lives in trees			2
after @entity18 left his crate , he was supposed to climb the tree in front of him to a platform @entity48 and his team had constructed			2
frustratingly , @entity18 was n't using his training			0
he remained on the ground , walking around , as we followed him for more than half an hour			0

several members of the team were following @entity18 that day trying to coax him into the trees with fruit			2
finally , @entity48 theorized that @entity18 was staying on the ground because there were so many people around him walking on the ground			0
@entity18 has been modeling the behavior of human trainers for years , so maybe he wanted to be like us and stay on the ground			0
we did n't want to hurt @entity18 's chances of survival , so we decided to leave him and the @entity13 trackers to go about their day			2
it was too early to tell how @entity18 will be able to survive in the rainforest by himself			0
we would have to wait and get an update from @entity48 later			0
walking back to the camp , we were all feeling a sense of awe and hope for the future of @entity15 orangutans and for endangered species worldwide			1
if this species can be brought back from the brink of extinction , could this be a model for other species ?			2
