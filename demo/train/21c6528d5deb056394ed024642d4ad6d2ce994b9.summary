-- nearly five years into its war against drug cartels , @entity4 on wednesday was rebuked by a human rights organization that found a pattern of abuses by security forces			1
@entity9 released a report based on interviews with victims , government officials and documents , concluding that the military and federal police offensive has resulted in a growing number of human rights violations that are not investigated adequately			1
@entity4 president @entity25 deployed the first of more than 45,000 troops in 2006 to combat drug cartel violence , but , according to @entity9 , instead of solving the problem , it has " exacerbated a climate of violence , lawlessness , and fear in many parts of the country			1
" the human rights organization conducted its research in five states in distinct parts of @entity4 affected by the drug violence -- @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
so the study included hot spots like @entity42 , which is in @entity36 , while excluding other fronts in the drug wars , like @entity45 or the border state of @entity47			0
in short , the organization found in those five states more than 170 cases where there was evidence of torture , 39 " disappearances " with evidence suggesting the involvement of security forces , and evidence of 24 cases of extrajudicial killings			1
the pattern that emerges , according to @entity9 , is that these are not isolated acts , but rather " examples of abusive practices endemic to the current public security strategy			1
" likely aware of the upcoming report , @entity4 's @entity67 last week gave a robust defense of its record and self - policing ability with the announcement of the convictions of 14 servicemen , including two officers for homicide			1
a military tribunal found the soldiers guilty in the 2007 shooting deaths of five people at a military checkpoint in @entity45			2
the @entity67 , known as @entity82 , said its army is " always ensuring adherence to the law , observing human rights , and in those cases where there is a presumed violation of individual rights , the start of investigations to find the responsible party			0
" since the beginning of the campaign , @entity82 has kept a constant open channel of communication with @entity4 's @entity100 , the ministry said			2
during that time , 89 complaints against the military resulted in recommendations to @entity82 by the human rights body , the ministry said			2
" that is , only 1.53 % of all the complaints " filed have resulted in action by the human rights commission , the ministry said			2
but @entity9 found something more pervasive			1
in the more than 170 torture cases it found , the tactic was mostly used to extract information about organized crime and to elicit confessions , the organization said			2
common types of torture recorded included beating , asphyxiation with plastic bags , waterboarding , electric shocks , sexual torture and death threats , " the organization said			0
in the case of the 39 disappearances , @entity9 depended on the testimony of witnesses who saw people being taken by security forces , but who state officials deny arresting or ever having in custody			1
in one of several testimonies gathered by @entity9 , a widow tells of how she ; her husband , @entity141 , 37 ; and two children were driving in @entity42 last year when they were pulled over by federal police			2
according to the wife , the police yanked @entity141 out of the car " in a bad way " and then went to the couple 's home , which they ransacked			0
according to the organization , the police tore the place up and left with documents			0
the wife filed complaints with several state and federal police bodies , providing the plate numbers of the police cars that took her husband			0
two weeks later , @entity141 's body was found in an abandoned house , with syringes around his body			0
@entity9 said that while it looked like an overdose , examinations showed that @entity141 had died from blows to the head ; prosecutors dragged their feet on the investigation ; and to date , there is no progress in the investigation			2
this was an example of the 24 suspected cases of extrajudicial killings carried out by security forces , according to the organization			1
in all , the group conducted more than 200 interviews with government officials , security forces , victims , witnesses , human rights defenders and others			1
the report also criticized @entity25 for generalizing that the majority of victims were involved in organized crime themselves			0
@entity25 has said that up to 90 % of victims had ties to the drug underworld , but @entity9 found that figure to be unreliable			1
among the report 's recommendations , it suggests ensuring civil trials for all alleged military misconduct and enforcing due process to guarantee detainee rights			0
@entity202 , a security analyst , said the report 's findings are not surprising			0
" you can not have 45,000 soldiers around the country , fighting this battle , and claim that there are no violations of any kind			0
that would be impossible , " he said			0
however , he said , the organization falls short of proving its allegations			0
" the thing i find interesting is that ( in ) all of these years , @entity9 has yet to raise a human rights violation against the @entity218 , the @entity219 , the @entity220 , the @entity221 and all of these people who have violated the human rights of many thousands of @entity4 , a large number of which are dead by their own hands , " he said			1
@entity0 's @entity227 contributed to this report .			0

a new report says @entity4 security forces are behind some abuses
@entity9 found evidence of torture , *kidnappings* and killings
the military says only a tiny *fraction* of complaints result in action
