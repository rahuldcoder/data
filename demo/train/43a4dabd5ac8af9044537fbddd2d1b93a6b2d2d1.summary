-- forget the distracting cameo by @entity2			1
despite its disjointed narrative , " call of duty : @entity10 " twisted me around so many times with its compelling story that i really enjoyed myself			1
@entity11 set this new chapter of the popular first - person - shooter franchise in two time periods : the late 1980s and 2025			1
they consulted with military experts who helped guide what the future technology of war should and should n't look like			1
the game 's single - player campaign staggers like a drunken @entity24 's reveler between the past and the future			1
missions hop from one time to another with little or no continuity between the actions			1
one mission will have you battling in @entity33 during the late ' 80s , and then the next takes you to a luxury resort in the @entity35 in the near future , with different characters and different weapons			1
the reason for this back - and - forth is nestled in the father / son storyline of the @entity42 family			1
@entity43 is a @entity44 vet who is called back into active duty in 1986 to help the @entity46 with some missions in @entity48 and @entity49			1
in the future , son @entity50 is a @entity52 , leading a @entity54 team			1
linking the two is a terrorist known as @entity57			1
he harbors great anger toward the @entity60 and capitalism in general			1
players discover @entity57 's motivations through the past missions , which reveal how he plans his final revenge in the future			1
the backdrop for all this is the @entity69 between the @entity70 and the @entity71 , and a new @entity69 between the @entity70 and @entity72			1
the new tensions are spurred not by ideology but by a soon - to - be depleted resource known as rare earth minerals -- those materials used in nearly all our computer technology			2
combat combat is pretty typical for a first - person shooter game			2
plenty of weapon choices and some destructible environments make for fast - paced , frenetic battle scenes			2
some of the weapon effects are suspect though as shots to the head do not always kill their targets			2
the enemies are n't the brightest bulbs in the box and are predictable in their actions			2
there were times i cleared the area of bad guys , just to have another wave rush in before i could move forward			2
and then another one after that			2
also , my adversaries did n't show much imagination when attacking , choosing the same pathways each time and the same prairie - dog tendency to pop up from behind cover so i could pick them off			1
there is little challenge to the larger combat scenes			2
more fun is the vehicle portion of combat			2
using the nimble quad - copter drones in the sky and the mechanized claw ( @entity116 ) on the ground brought new energy to the battles			2
during the @entity122 missions ( these are side missions to the central campaign , but critical to the final outcome ) , players can take over control of these devices , which offers a refreshing new perspective on the battlefield while dealing damage to the enemy			2
the @entity122 missions themselves are new to the franchise			1
they 're not directly part of the storyline , but how you perform in them will help shape the game 's ending sequence			2
players are tasked to attack or defend different points on a battlefield , and can either do it at ground level , by taking over one of the combat units , or by directing all the troops from an overhead view			0
failure is an option here , and if you do n't succeed with your squad allotments , you do n't get to try again			0
story i found the storyline interesting			0
while most of the action occurs through the eyes of the @entity42 family , there were some instances when i got to see what was happening from another character 's perspective			0
this helped explain much of the reasoning behind characters ' actions			0
a @entity2 shows up briefly near the end of the game as the secretary of defense in 2025 , congratulating the team on a job well done			1
( @entity175 publisher @entity173 , in a recent statement , said , " including gen. @entity2 and other real - life figures was strictly a creative decision made many months ago when the storyline was drafted			1
" ) other real - life people in the game include former @entity33 president @entity182 and lt. col. @entity183 , the central figure from the 1987 @entity185			0
@entity186 did his own voice for the game and even acted an adviser			0
historical footage from the 1980s and ' 90s features former presidents @entity192 and @entity193			1
the game 's ending is simultaneously emotional and confusing			0
but your experience may vary			0
key missions produce variable endings , depending on what you do and who survives			0
they all add up to a variety of endings for the main characters and add to the replay value if you are the kind of gamer who wants to see all the potential conclusions			0
multiplayer modes if killing the undead is more your speed , " @entity10 " brought back the zombies from the previous game in a side - campaign fight for survival			1
this turned out to be more fun than i expected because of the bonus add - ons you can collect and the power - ups that turn your weapon into a more potent killing machine			0
the zombie voice acting is extremely funny			0
i do n't know if i 'd enjoy a full game of just zombies , but it does make a nice change of pace from all the realism of the regular combat			0
if you like multiplayer action , " @entity10 " gives you plenty of modes			1
you can choose your class , weapons and maps from many different combinations			0
most matches contain up to 12 players , while some go as high as 18			0
the action is clean and the intensity is high			0
at one point during my multiplayer session , there were more than 650,000 players online			0
you can also record your gameplay to view later and see what you did right and wrong			0
however , i should mention that some things -- such as my brutal ending to the game -- are not meant to be seen again			0
overall , " @entity257 : @entity10 " does n't break any new ground with its graphics or gameplay mechanics			1
but it does provide an emotionally intense single - player story , an enjoyably silly zombie mode and enough multiplayer modes for everyone to find a good game			0
combined , that 's enough to keep gamers glued to their controllers for many nights to come			1
" @entity257 : @entity10 " is available in @entity271 ; it will be released in @entity273 and @entity274 on november 30 , and @entity275 on december 20			1
it can be played on the @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279			0
the game is rated m for mature due to blood and gore , intense violence , strong language , suggestive themes and use of drugs			0
this review was done with a provided @entity290 copy for the @entity278 .			0

" @entity257 : @entity10 " is an *exciting* ride that should keep gamers *riveted*
the popular franchise is set in two time periods : the late 1980s and 2025
@entity175 is available in @entity271 and will be released this month in @entity273 , @entity274
