-- " @entity3 " fans are hot -- and not for the reason you might think			2
no sooner were the stars of the forthcoming film adaptation of the wildly successful erotic novel announced than the @entity8 roared its disapproval			0
no , no , no some fans cried to the casting of @entity12 and @entity13 as @entity3 and @entity3 respectively			1
the front - runners for the gig appear to be " @entity16 " star @entity17 and @entity18 , who is best known from the hit tv show " @entity21			1
" there is even a @entity24 petition demanding that the roles be recast and given to that pair			1
as we learned with the drama that became " @entity29 " ( yes , that 's henceforth the term for the madness that went down when it was announced that @entity31 would be playing @entity32 ) people take very seriously these casting decisions -- especially when it 's a pair of characters they have been fantasizing about			0
therefore it seems like just about everyone has " @entity3 " opinion			0
and @entity40 lit up with them , from the serious to the semi-joshing .			0

@entity12 and @entity13 have been cast in the film
some fans *wanted* @entity17 and @entity18 to get the roles
a petition is being *circulated*
