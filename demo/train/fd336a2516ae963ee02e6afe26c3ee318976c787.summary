-- speculation about the future of @entity3 has been swirling for months			1
still , many travelers were stunned tuesday to learn that the carrier and its parent company have filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy			2
@entity8 , @entity9 and all other subsidiaries will honor all tickets and reservations and operate normal flight schedules during the bankruptcy filing process			1
@entity0 airline and aviation correspondent @entity15 weighed in on some of the basic questions about the airline 's decision			1
why has @entity3 decided to make this move ? @entity15 : they 're doing it for one simple reason : the @entity3 cost base is considerably higher than @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 , which merged with @entity28			1
those other airlines did go through chapter 11 during ( past ) recessions and they managed to slash their costs			2
so now @entity8 has been struggling for the last few years trying to negotiate , trying to get agreements , trying to get its costs down			1
but frankly , with oil prices high , with growth slowing down , and with so many other competitive disadvantages , incoming ceo @entity35 told me a short while ago they really had no choice			0
it was time to push the nuclear button			0
there 's no doubt it is a dramatic development for a company that has several billions of dollars in cash			2
it has good strong hubs			0
all in all , this is being done purely and simply not because @entity8 is going bankrupt -- the planes are still flying , the champagne is still being served in first class , all things will be normal -- it 's being done to get down the costs			1
if i have a ticket now or for six months from now , should i be worried ? quest : there is no danger that @entity3 is going to stop flying			1
let 's be absolutely crystal clear about that			0
for the traveling public , this has absolutely no effect			0
i think many travelers are used to this			0
they flew @entity25 in @entity71 , they flew @entity27 , @entity72 and all the others in @entity71 during those times			0
@entity35 told me he hopes the @entity71 will last less time than the others , the average being 16 months			0
if you 're flying @entity8 , do n't worry are any changes coming to the airline ? quest : the people who i think perhaps will be watching and be concerned are @entity8 's employees			1
no changes immediately , but longer term , they can expect to see some significant changes in their benefits and in their conditions of employment .			2

@entity3 files for bankruptcy ; says it will operate normal flight schedules
@entity0 airline and aviation correspondent : move is intended to bring down costs
quest : i think many travelers are used to this
quest : @entity8 's employees can expect to see significant changes in their benefits
