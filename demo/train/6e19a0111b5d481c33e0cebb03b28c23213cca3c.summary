@entity0 -- @entity3 must stay locked up in the @entity0 jail for at least another week while his lawyer negotiates with the prosecutor about his probation violation , a judge said thursday			1
@entity3 attended a hearing thursday wearing an orange jail suit , just hours after a cross-country trip from @entity11 to @entity0 on the federal government 's inmate transport system , informally known as " @entity14			1
" " he 's doing remarkably well under the circumstances , " @entity3 lawyer @entity15 told @entity1			1
" it 's a challenging situation to be in			0
" @entity15 and assistant district attorney @entity19 agreed to hold talks over the next week concerning @entity3 possibly admitting that he violated his probation			0
if that happens , it will be announced at a hearing next friday			0
otherwise , the judge will set a date for a trial on his probation revocation			0
" i 'm hoping we get it resolved and we get it resolved quickly , " @entity15 said after the hearing			0
@entity15 said he would also file a motion to have @entity3 released from jail , which would be considered at the may 9 hearing			0
@entity3 , who turns 25 next monday , spent most of the past week traveling back to @entity0 following a delay in the start of his trial on a misdemeanor assault charge in @entity11			1
@entity41 , who took @entity3 from the @entity0 jail for extradition to @entity11 four weeks ago , handed him back to @entity45 's deputies just hours before thursday 's hearing , according to deputy u.s. marshal @entity47			1
@entity3 's probation for the 2009 beating of ex-girlfriend @entity50 was revoked after his @entity11 arrest			1
he 's spent the past six weeks in custody and previous five months in court - ordered rehab			2
the prosecutor said last week that she would " strenuously object " to @entity3 being released because it appears likely @entity3 will be found guilty of the assault charge in @entity11			2
assistant district attorney @entity19 argued the only change since @entity3 was jailed in march is that his case has " gotten worse			0
" the @entity11 judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that @entity3 was " the initial aggressor " in the incident , @entity61 said			2
a @entity0 judge refused a request last week to free the singer from custody so he could make his own way back from @entity11			2
he and bodyguard @entity72 were arrested on assault charges in @entity11 for allegedly beating a man who tried to take a photo of @entity3 last october			2
the arrest led to a revocation of @entity3 's probation , but he was allowed to enter a rehab program instead of going to jail			1
he was ordered to jail last month when he was kicked out of the rehab program for rules violations			0
planes , chains and automobiles : @entity3 's miserable trip to trial " i think it 's a little over the top to have him in custody on this misdemeanor when everybody saw the bodyguard 's trial and which was nothing more than a bloody nose , " @entity3 lawyer @entity15 told reporters in @entity11 last week			1
" and you have got the bodyguard who was convicted and who readily admitted he was the one who did the @entity100 so all of this is much ado about nothing			0
" @entity3 's freedom at stake with 2 cases the delay in @entity3 's @entity11 trial came after prosecutors refused to grant immunity to @entity72 so he could testify without jeopardizing his own case			1
on monday , @entity72 was found guilty of assaulting a man on a @entity11 sidewalk before @entity3 's trial was to begin in the case			1
the prosecutors cited @entity72 's refusal to talk to them about his testimony as a major reason for the decision not to grant immunity			0
their motion also said they suspected he might lie in his testimony to help @entity125 .			0

new : " he 's doing remarkably well under the circumstances , " @entity3 lawyer says
judge : @entity3 must stay in jail for at least another week
@entity3 's october @entity11 arrest triggered 5 months rehab , 7 weeks in jail
he turns 25 next monday
