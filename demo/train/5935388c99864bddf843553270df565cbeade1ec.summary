-- under president @entity2 , the @entity1 has deported about 400,000 undocumented immigrants each year			1
that 's an average of 1,100 people , including moms and dads and children , per day			0
these are people who are in the @entity1 largely because our businesses lure -- and rely on -- many of them to do the unskilled jobs @entity1 do n't want to do			0
they are people who have come to the @entity1 as generations came before , to feed their families and fulfill a dream			2
and we 're kicking them out			0
every day , in busloads			0
this weekend , thousands of undocumented immigrants and their allies took to the streets of @entity22 and communities across the country to demand that president @entity2 put an end to reckless and rampant deportations in @entity1			1
" not one more , " the marchers chanted			0
there are literally 11 million - plus reasons to stop deportations in the @entity1 -- 11 million undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation every day			1
there is also the collateral damage done to their citizen families who do n't want their lives torn apart and to their co-workers , employers and community members			1
so what are the reasons not to stop our abysmal , extreme rate of deportations ? there are basically three			2
first , anti-immigrant activists insist that the people being deported are dangerous criminals — and that they should be deported faster and at even higher rates			2
yet monday , the @entity52 released an analysis of government records revealing that of the nearly 2 million people deported since president @entity2 took office , two - thirds had no criminal record whatsoever or had committed only minor infractions , such as traffic violations			1
sure , on a technical level anyone in the @entity1 without official permission has broken the law			2
but let 's not over-dramatize the reality			0
technically , everyone who has ever driven above the speed limit or jaywalked has also broken the law			2
and many undocumented immigrants in the @entity1 originally arrived with authorized work or travel visas and simply stayed in the country past the expiration date of their paperwork			2
this is the great " crime " that anti-immigrant activists insist all undocumented immigrants have committed , asserting that folks should instead " get in line			2
" but the line is broken			0
decades ago , it simply was easier for aspiring @entity1 to get green cards or visas for family members : the @entity1 let more people in and made it easier for immigrants already here to bring along their families			1
today , those " lines " are longer and harder to get into			0
and yet the economic need for immigrants , not to mention @entity1 's cultural imperative for inclusion and diversity , is unyielding			0
our policies have simply not kept up			0
the second argument against stopping deportations is a tactical one , made especially by the @entity101 in arguing that it needs to show toughness in immigration enforcement to increase its hand in pushing for comprehensive reform			1
but the fact is that even though president @entity2 's administration has deported more immigrants than any president before him , many @entity108 still argue it is n't enough and backed off on their recent support of immigration reform , claiming they could n't trust president @entity2 to implement any law if passed			1
if a record rate of deportation against undocumented immigrants with only the most minor of offenses has been insufficient to bring republicans to the bargaining table , perhaps now the @entity101 will finally realize that its self - destructive capitulation wo n't yield rational behavior on the part of @entity108			1
today 's @entity108 seem perpetually willing to alienate increasingly vital @entity125 voters — and even big business interests who favor immigration reform — in favor of continuing to placate their loyal , but dying , old , white and socially narrow - minded voting base			1
the final argument against stopping deportations is that president @entity2 does n't have the legal authority to do so			1
everyone from top constitutional lawers to the @entity52 editorial board agree the president is well within his authority to determine how immigration enforcement resources are prioritized and deployed			0
and president @entity2 has already used his executive authority to grant temporary deportation relief to undocumented immigrants brought to @entity1 by their parents when they were young , so - called @entity140 who grew up in the @entity1 and yet legally ca n't find a place in the only nation they 've ever called home			1
what president @entity2 did for @entity140 is wonderful ; now many of these kids can get in - state tuition or federal loans for college and go on to get good jobs as teachers and engineers our nation needs			2
but to only use his authority to grant relief for these most - sympathetic of immigrants would reflect the sort of political risk aversion that has so often typified our 44th president			0
the @entity101 indeed has said it is using its executive discretion to only deport those immigrants with dangerous criminal records			1
as the @entity52 reported , this is simply not true			0
of the nearly 2 million immigrants the @entity2 administration has deported — a milestone we 're expected to hit any day — at least 1.6 million of those deported were for minor offenses like traffic violations			1
in other words , overwhelmingly , we 're not kicking violent offenders out of the country but moms and dads and hardworking aspiring @entity1 who got parking tickets and now are being ripped away from their families			0
the @entity101 could legitimately and wisely reprioritize those law enforcement resources to investigate unsolved murders or sexual assaults or prevent terrorism or mass shootings			0
the arguments against stopping deportations are weak at best and getting weaker every day			0
we need comprehensive immigration reform in the @entity1 to finally fix our broken immigration system and create a path to citizenship for undocumented @entity1			1
but until @entity108 are willing to do the right thing by immigrants , our economy and our nation 's values , president @entity2 can and must stop the excessive deportations under his watch			1

@entity199 : under @entity2 administration , some 400,000 immigrants a year deported
she says *majority* deported had no criminal record , families torn by deportations
she says @entity108 immigration reform efforts a ruse ; party *obstructs* fix to broken system
@entity199 : @entity2 must use executive discretion to halt rampant deportations
