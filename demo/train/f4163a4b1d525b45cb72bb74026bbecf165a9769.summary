-- about 70,000 refugees who fled violence in @entity4 are living in " appalling " conditions in a camp in the middle of the @entity9 desert , @entity1 said friday			1
the situation has only got worse in @entity13 camp since @entity15 forces entered @entity4 in january to help local forces take on @entity18 militants , the humanitarian group said			1
about 15,000 more refugees have flooded into the camp since the fighting , and conditions are so bad there that many who were healthy became ill or malnourished after they arrived			1
@entity9 : slavery 's last stronghold the number of children admitted to clinics in the camp for severe malnutrition more than doubled in that time , climbing from 42 to 106 , @entity1 said			1
about 85 % of the children under treatment arrived between january and february , despite the nutritional status of the new refugees being generally good when assessed on arrival			2
" these statistics show that the refugees have grown weaker whilst in the camp , the very place where they should have been receiving assistance , including correctly formulated food rations from aid organizations , " said @entity35 , emergency coordinator for @entity1			1
" there has clearly been a lack of preparation for this new influx of refugees			2
" the camp was set up by the @entity51 refugee agency , @entity50 , with the @entity9 government 60 kilometers ( about 37 miles ) from the border when refugees started arriving in early 2012			1
the report , " stranded in the @entity56 , " is based on testimonies collected from more than 100 refugees at the @entity13 camp between february and mid-march of this year			1
the majority of the refugees in @entity13 camp are pastoralists who lived nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles in northern @entity4 , according to the report			1
some of the families left their young men behind to tend to their herds while they fled over the border into neighboring @entity9			0
" most of the refugees are from the @entity74 and @entity75 communities , " said @entity35			2
" they fled preemptively , often for fear of violence due to their presumed links with @entity18 or separatist groups			2
their home in northern @entity4 is still in the grip of fear and mistrust			1
" limited water , poor hygiene facilities while some improvements have been made at the camp since the mass influx of new refugees three months ago , @entity1 said , " the challenge will be to continue to provide assistance that meets humanitarian standards			1
" water is still in short supply in the desert camp , a situation made worse by daytime temperatures that reach 50 degrees @entity99 ( 122 degrees @entity100 )			1
refugees at @entity13 receive just 11 liters of water per person per day , instead of the 20 liters recommended by humanitarian standards , the report said			1
some of the families that arrived in january had to wait more than a month for materials to build shelters , the report said			2
they were forced to do what they could with sticks and scraps of cloth in the meantime			0
there is also a serious shortage of toilet facilities			0
when the camp was extended in january to accommodate the influx of refugees , there were four latrines for 12,000 people -- far below the recommended minimum of one per 20 people			2
more are now being built , but the hygiene situation remains difficult			0
another problem is that the rations provided by the @entity131 , mostly rice and pulses , are very different from the pastoralist refugees ' customary diet , which is based on meat and milk			2
many new arrivals also suffer from delays in getting food supplies , the report said			2
and with the situation in northern @entity4 still volatile as @entity15 and @entity145 forces hunt down the remaining @entity18 fighters -- and against a backdrop of complex ethnic and political tensions -- it 's unclear when the refugees will feel able to return home			1
@entity4 : the long , troubled desert road ahead ' this time , we left early ' a 71 - year - old @entity4 interviewed for the report , @entity154 , said three sons had stayed in their village to care for the livestock , but the rest of his family had left			1
" with the other village chiefs , we took the decision to leave out of fear of the @entity4 army , " he said			2
" i lost brothers and cousins in 1992			0
i saw a lot of atrocities and i lost a lot of loved ones in the conflict			0
i almost lost all my animals too			0
this time , we left early			0
nobody knows when we will be back but , at my age , i have no desire to go into exile every 10 years			0
" about a quarter of those interviewed said they 'd fled direct fighting where their lives or family members ' lives were in danger			0
a small percentage said they had fled because of the seizure of power by @entity18 groups in cities such as @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			0
@entity18 extremists carved out a large haven in northern @entity4 last year , taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party @entity199			1
many of the most recent arrivals in the camp told @entity1 they had left @entity4 because of food shortages and other problems			1
" life has become very hard			0
i had nothing to give to my children			0
there was nothing to eat , shops were closed or empty			0
there was no market for cattle			0
i could not stay because i have small children to feed , " said @entity215 , aged 24			0
@entity1 has been working at @entity217 since february 2012 , when the first groups of refugees from @entity4 began to arrive			1
its teams have treated about 1,000 malnourished children since then and delivered about 200 babies			0
even before the latest influx of refugees , the nutritional situation was critical , with a study by @entity1 in november revealing mortality rates above the emergency threshold for children under 2 years old			1
since the @entity15 - led intervention in january , the number of consultations at its clinics in the camp has gone up from 1,500 to 2,500 per week , @entity1 said			2
@entity50 has said that it and partner agencies " struggle to maintain minimum humanitarian standards in @entity236			0
" @entity0 's @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
