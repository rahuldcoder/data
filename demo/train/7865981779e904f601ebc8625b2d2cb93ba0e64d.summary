-- @entity1 stood down as coach of the @entity4 national team saturday in the wake of their quarterfinal exit at @entity8			1
a statement on the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) website confirmed he would not be renewing his contract after two years in charge of @entity14			2
the @entity10 said @entity1 had contacted their president , @entity15 , to inform him of the decision			0
the executive committee of the @entity10 will meet tuesday to begin their hunt for a successor ahead of the qualifying campaign for the @entity21 in @entity22			2
the 46 - year - old @entity1 took over from the much criticized @entity23 after the disastrous @entity4 showing in the @entity25 in @entity26 where a player strike and an exit at the group stages proved a national humiliation			1
the former @entity32 coach , who was a key player in @entity14 's @entity34 triumph and their victory at the 2000 @entity38 championships , appeared to have restored their fortunes going into @entity8			1
but an unbeaten 23 - match run was ended with a 2 - 0 defeat to @entity43 in their final group match , leaving them to face defending champions @entity48 in the quarterfinals			0
reports of a dressing room row after that defeat was hardly the best preparation for the last eight clash which ended in another 2 - 0 reverse			0
@entity57 's @entity56 reacted angrily to that setback in media interviews and he is facing disciplinary action by the @entity10			0
@entity1 's departure has followed , having survived a scandal in april 2011 when he allegedly favored the introduction of race quotas on the number of dual nationality players at @entity14 's national youth training centers			1
he was exonerated of any wrong - doing after appearing before a joint hearing of the @entity10 and the @entity69 , but he faced criticism from ex-teammates @entity71 and @entity73			0
former @entity75 coach @entity74 and @entity76 , a former @entity4 captain , have been touted as possible successors to @entity1 , who is set to return to club management .			2
