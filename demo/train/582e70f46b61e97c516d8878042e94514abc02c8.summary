-- dear @entity1 , the technology industry needs you			2
around the world , people are watching movies on laptops , buying goods online and connecting with friends and family through mobile devices			2
all of these experiences are powered by technology , created by people just like you			2
girls of the world , the tech industry is waiting for you			1
the skills you learn in your math and sciences classes today are the foundation for building technology that will touch nearly every aspect of our lives in the future -- your future			1
if you invest in learning technical skills , soon you wo n't just be consuming technology , you 'll be defining it , creating it and sharing it with people all over the world			1
the tech industry is growing faster than nearly all other industries today			0
in fact , computer programming jobs are growing at two times the @entity39 national average			0
and it 's still very early days			0
@entity42 , for example , is only in its teenage years			1
the opportunities for a career in technology will only continue to grow as an additional 5 billion people around the world come online			1
yet despite being a ripe career field , the tech industry is losing women			2
in the @entity39 , according to one report : " young women earned 37 % of computer science degrees in 1985 ; today , the number has plummeted to 18 %			2
some 22 % of software engineers at tech companies are women			2
" it 's a deficiency we see mirrored around the world			0
if this trend continues , fewer women will have the skills necessary to participate in the tech sector			0
as a result , fewer women will hold leadership positions in tech , and we 'll miss out on the opportunity for women to shape the world around us			1
this is n't a problem just for women , but for everyone			1
innovation thrives on diversity , and we simply ca n't afford for the future of technology not to represent women or people with different backgrounds and experiences			1
that 's why it 's so important for tech leaders to reach out to girls with encouragement			0
we need to share our enthusiasm and show them all the amazing opportunities available today			0
getting girls excited about technology is n't just a job for educators , it 's a responsibility for all of us			1
we also need to create more opportunities for girls to learn technical skills			0
we have a great start with programs such as the @entity101 and @entity102 that give people access to computer programming education			0
there are also fantastic local programs that connect girls with communities of other like - minded girls to learn together			0
for example , @entity42 supports a program called @entity113 that provides science , technology , engineering and mathematics education to girls through afterschool programs and camps			1
but there are also many girls out there struggling to find access to even the most basic education			0
the @entity126 helps to bridge this gap by funding science and technology education for primary and secondary school students around the world			1
and initiatives such as @entity133 put a spotlight on just how powerful access to education can be for young women			0
for girls who do n't benefit from support early on , it 's also important to remember that it 's never too late to get started			1
i was finishing up my senior year of college , studying history and literature , when i decided to get into tech. i wondered if it was too late to change paths , but i decided to do it anyway			0
years later , i joined a new startup -- @entity42 -- and i 've never looked back			1
for all the girls out there who think it 's too late to get into tech , know that it 's never too late to pursue a good opportunity , even if it means taking a different path			0
so , people of the world , let 's help girls rise up in the field of technology and support them with the programs they need			1
if you 're in technology , talk to your daughters , nieces and friends about just how cool it is to work in tech. and we can all help them find internships , encourage them in their studies and foster their creative spirits			0
the future of technology affects us all			2
let 's all work together to build it			0
