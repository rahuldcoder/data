@entity0 , @entity1 -- turn up the music , crack the window -- falling gas prices have flipped on the road - trip ignition switch			0
the @entity8 at @entity9 is 104 feet long and 95 feet wide at the alcove			0
i decided to celebrate the unofficial return of reasonable driving vacations with a venture to the ultimate temple of excess -- @entity9			0
from @entity0 , my family and i retraced the journey of @entity20 luminaries who headed north to hang out with publishing tycoon @entity21			1
@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity21 's mistress @entity27 all made the trek to what @entity21 called " @entity9 , " or the @entity30			1
@entity31 and president @entity32 also rested here amid art and antiquities from around the world			1
@entity9 looks down over golden fields , the glistening @entity38 and the town of @entity40 , @entity1 , home to less than 500 people			1
we took a tour bus from the visitors center to the mansion , a long gull 's dive from the ocean , 1,610 feet above sea level			0
@entity21 hired @entity51 architect @entity50 in 1919 and by 1947 the 165 - room estate stretched over 127 acres			1
it 's crystal clear @entity21 was a demanding mastermind of his kingdom on the hill , putting @entity50 through what must have been agonizing brain twisters			1
visitors see that when @entity21 wanted @entity62 choir chairs wedged into his assembly room , @entity50 made it work			1
when he wanted elaborate ceilings salvaged from @entity62 , @entity50 expanded their reach to fit into the estate 's rooms			1
a massive 95 x 104 - foot outdoor swimming pool , made of concrete and @entity73 marble , is one of the central jewels of the property			0
our guide recounted @entity21 house rules			1
in an effort to control his guests ' alcohol consumption , @entity21 banned them from bringing their own liquor			1
the @entity20 types reportedly snuck it in anyway , like frat boys at a football game			2
guests stayed in opulent guest houses adorned with religious icons , art and other worldly treasures			0
@entity21 mandated unmarried guests sleep apart , while violating his own edict by sleeping with his beloved actress friend @entity27			2
though @entity21 remained married to @entity98 , with whom he had five children , @entity101 ' ghost is everywhere at @entity9			2
images of the actress , along with @entity22 and others stars , flicker about in a short film shown in the mansion 's 50 - seat movie theater			2
museum - worthy pieces fill the property , including intricate @entity113 tapestries in an east - facing sitting room called the @entity115			2
owing to my @entity122 roots , i looked at the tapestries and cracked to my kids , " no wonder my 83 - year - old mother can still sew a tiny patch onto a girl scout vest			0
" the castle 's grandeur was enough to hold the childrens ' attention			0
we saw them as young as 4 years old , eyes popping while taking in ancient @entity132 statues or towering @entity134 trees			0
" this guy was rich ! " my friend 's 7 - year - old - son , @entity135 , exclaimed			0
perhaps a headline from @entity21 's @entity139 in another era could best describe our trip : " the road to fun is back and affordable ! "			0

@entity21 entertained @entity20 stars at his estate near @entity40
the 165 - room estate stretches over 127 acres *overlooking* the @entity38
@entity21 filled the rooms with art and antiquities from around the world
