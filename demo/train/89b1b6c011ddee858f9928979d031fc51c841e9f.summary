-- the @entity2 president and his @entity4 friends had another think coming if they thought they could sneak a radical constitution past the people who fought for democracy in @entity9			1
the draft constitution , and the political maneuvers that made it possible , have sparked the rage of liberal and secular @entity2 , who fear their dream of a truly free @entity2 , with genuine equality for men and women , for people of all religions , is slipping away			1
why is democracy proving so difficult , perhaps impossible , to put in place ? one reason stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what democracy means			1
in places where dictatorship has prevailed , many hold the incorrect belief that democracy equals majority rule			2
they think democracy is a method for imposing the views of those who win elections upon those who lose			1
clearly , elections and majorities are a key element of decision - making in a democracy			2
but just as important is establishing basic principles of fairness and justice , creating a consensus of what the nation considers fair , and then developing the institutions and rules that guarantee they will survive through the ups and downs of politics			0
news : @entity57 aide blames upheaval on small , powerful minority the creation of that foundation is known as the " constitutional moment , " a crucial time in a nation 's history when the people come together to decide what they believe , what truths they consider " self - evident			1
" it 's a moment that , ideally , sets aside the political fashions of the day			2
to succeed and create a stable future , it demands a measure of consensus			0
the heart of the political battle in @entity2 today lies in the proposed constitution , which president @entity57 insists he will bring up for a vote this week , a move the opposition calls an act of war			1
" many countries are familiar with this process			0
@entity83 have studied the evolution of the national consensus that led to the @entity86 , a document so brief and brilliant it is regarded with a depth of reverence usually reserved for mystical religious texts			0
the @entity90 has been wrestling with a constitutional document , unable to create one that builds true consensus			0
in @entity2 , the @entity95 and the more radical @entity96 known as @entity97 dominated the country 's first democratic elections and took their victories as a green light to ignore the views of the opposition			1
@entity4 parties had a head start in electoral politics , far ahead of secular and liberal parties			1
under dictatorship , @entity4 parties , though brutally persecuted , could carry their message through public services			1
the message of the @entity112 , now appropriated by @entity4 parties , gave them a running advantage out of the political gate			1
liberal parties have a complicated case to make			1
it not easy to explain that you can be devoutly @entity95 and support the secular rule of law , for example			1
it is also easier to explain the fairness of majority rule than the concept that in democracy it is crucial to protect minorities			2
@entity128 : @entity129 : did torture really net bin @entity130 ? with easy electoral victories , @entity96 proceeded to implement their agenda , much faster than many expected			0
a spokesman for the @entity95 , a man named @entity57 , had declared in 2011 , " we are not seeking power			1
" the make - up of the panel that would write the constitution sparked bitter conflict from the beginning			1
the assembly , which should have made the most of the country 's precious constitutional moment , was supposed to include representatives of all segments of society , constitutional scholars , intellectuals , members of professional guilds , union members , writers ; in short , views from all @entity2			1
the first panel was such a transparent power - grab by @entity96 that the courts threw it out			2
a second assembly chosen in june proved just as controversial			0
once again , the @entity95 's @entity161 used its muscle to pack it with supporters			1
non-islamists , one by one , walked out of the constitution - writing body in frustration at the strong - arm tactics			2
fearing the courts would invalidate the process , president @entity57 essentially made himself dictator on november 22 , the day after the rest of the world heaped praise on him for helping broker a ceasefire between @entity177 and @entity178 , providing a measure of political cover			1
the opposition took to the streets , in what started to look like @entity184			0
then @entity57 ordered the constitutional assembly to hurry up and finish its work			2
in a mad rush , with a final session of 19 hours , the assembly approved a draft			0
by then , all the @entity192 walked out			0
the document , scheduled to go to voters for ratification on december 15 , is an affront against democratic principles			0
it lays the groundwork for an eminently un-free future			0
opinion : @entity57 miscalculating @entity2 ' rage trying to quiet the opposition , @entity57 rescinded the decree that gave him absolute power , but he plans to go forward with a constitutional referendum , pushing forward a document littered with tiny seeds that can germinate into religious oppression			1
it is not surprising that it received high praise from @entity213 , one of the country 's top ultra-conservative clerics , who raved about its many " restraints on rights " and concluded , " this will not be a democracy that can allow what @entity221 forbids , or forbids what @entity221 allows			0
" the constitution says @entity225 is the main source of legislation , and establishes that the ( unelected ) scholars of @entity228 , the ancient center of @entity95 learning , shall be consulted on @entity225 matters			1
the draft speaks of equality for all , but orders that the state should " balance between a woman 's obligations to family and public work			0
" it also says the state must " protect ethics and morals and public order , " and guard the " true nature of the family			0
" that alone is enough to justify every kind of interference in the personal lives of @entity2 , particularly women			2
the draft guarantees freedom of religion , but then says this is only for monotheist religions			0
it also bans " insulting prophets and messengers , " opening the door to curtailments of speech , especially on religious grounds , and creating fears for @entity260 , @entity261 , and followers of the persecuted @entity264 sect			0
this is just a sampler of what the constitutional draft brings			0
the opposition , at last looking coherent and unified , faces a steep road ahead			0
sadly , so does @entity2			2
president @entity57 and his @entity95 were not able to sneak their constitution in the dead of night			1
instead , the entire country has seen the murkiness of the process			0
instead of giving @entity2 strong democratic underpinnings , they have built a brittle foundation for a deeply divided country			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity285 .			0

@entity287 : democracy proving hard because @entity2 seems not to grasp how it works
she says many , particularly those who gain power , believe it is about imposing will on losers
she says @entity57 , @entity95 pushing @entity4 style power , their constitution an affront
@entity301 : opposition has uphill battle to make case . @entity2 risks losing " *consitutional* moment "
