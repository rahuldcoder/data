-- the death of @entity2 does not necessarily mean the death of @entity4 , the terrorist network he founded , though experts say none of his most likely successors offer the same combination of charisma , cash and credibility among militant @entity14			1
@entity2 has long been a prime target for @entity17 authorities , a member of the @entity20 's @entity19 since 1999 who has had a $ 25 million bounty on his head since after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
yet except for a few audiotapes on subjects ranging from climate change to @entity29 's role in @entity30 , he 's been relatively quiet in recent years			0
but that does not mean he 'll be easy to replace , nor that there is someone obvious to take his spot			0
a @entity17 counterterrorism official said monday there was " no succession plan in place " that the @entity17 government is aware of to replace @entity2			1
even if the @entity41 - born zealot appeared to have had a less active role of late in @entity4 's operations , he remained the symbol of his movement -- one that tried to appeal to @entity14 angry about allegedly corrupt and spiritually impure regimes in the @entity49 and beyond , propped up by the @entity17 and its allies			1
death of @entity2 brings healing he was known throughout the world , and beloved in parts of the @entity57 world , as someone who 'd given up a life of luxury to fight the @entity61 in @entity30 before focusing his wrath on the @entity63 as he tried to build a radical @entity65 society			1
" they do n't have anybody now who is going to have the star power , the brand name of @entity2 , " said @entity66 , a former @entity67 officer			2
his most obvious replacement -- given that he 's developed a high profile as a jihadist leader in @entity76 and is the face and voice in several videotapes since the 2001 attacks , some of them appearing by @entity2 's side -- is @entity84			1
born into a wealthy family in @entity86 , he was a key figure in the @entity88 who went to @entity30 during their fight against the @entity61 to offer his skills as a physician			0
by the 1990s , he refocused his attention on undermining and attacking the @entity76 government and , eventually , the @entity17			2
in 1998 , when his organization had effectively merged with @entity4 , he sent a fax to the @entity97 warning @entity17			2
three days later , suicide bombers hit the @entity17 embassies in @entity100 and @entity101 , killing 224 people			2
since then , @entity84 has been depicted as @entity2 's closest adviser , as well as his doctor			1
but , the @entity17 counterterrorism official said , he 's " not popular with colleagues			1
" " he 's viewed as a very polarizing figure , someone who is not easy to deal with , not a good manager , " said @entity66 , a senior research fellow at the @entity107			0
mixed emotions about @entity2 's death : how should we feel ? another possible contender is @entity115			1
born in 1971 in @entity116 , @entity117 , he bounced between @entity118 and the @entity17 before settling in the @entity49			1
his face is known largely for his role as a spokesman for @entity122 , which is considered one of the terror network 's most prolific and deadly affiliates			0
@entity126 has been suspected of playing a key part in the failed @entity129 plot , in 2009 by a @entity131 national to bring down a @entity133 jet as it neared @entity134			0
he also has been suspected of encouraging @entity137 maj. @entity136 to kill 13 fellow soldiers during a rampage at the @entity141 base in @entity142 earlier that year			0
yet @entity143 , a @entity0 terrorism analyst , said the fact that @entity145 has never engaged in combat himself may hurt him in any bid to climb up the @entity4 leadership ladder			0
the latest details of @entity2 operation " he 's a cleric , he 's a speaker , but he 's not a fighter , " said @entity143 , an alumni fellow at @entity153 's @entity152			2
" and @entity4 , over the years , have wanted to be led by a fighter			0
" other less well - known contenders could emerge to head @entity4 , or the base as it 's known in @entity158			0
they include men like @entity160 , a leading @entity4 ideologue			2
less than two months before @entity2 's death , the @entity162 native released an audiotape aimed at @entity165 in that country and encouraging change that went beyond ousting leaders like @entity169			1
a former @entity4 battlefield commander in @entity30 perhaps best known for escaping from @entity171 , @entity160 has been active in taped speeches urging resistance and trying to recruit new members			2
then there 's @entity176 , a veteran militant from @entity177 who has emerged as a mastermind of international terrorism operations , according to @entity180			1
the @entity181 , which he leads , has focused on finding and training recruits from @entity183 and @entity184 on the grounds that they are less likely to be apprehended			0
@entity2 killing caps decade - long manhunt the succession challenge is compounded by the fact that , even before @entity2 's death , many experts said @entity4 appeared to be staggering due to operational and organizational setbacks caused by actions like predator drone strikes and the intensified allied campaign in @entity30 and beyond			1
intelligence officials have warned that threats may spike in the coming weeks			0
but the @entity17 counterterrorism official said president @entity199 administration 's hope is that having a muddle of men posturing to be the next @entity2 could spur " disharmony and discord " among @entity4 's ranks			1
thus , while small bands of terrorists may continue to operate , the lack of one unifying leader threatens to undermine @entity4 as an ideological , spiritual and operational force			0
" it 's not good to have six people trying to fill ( @entity2 's ) shoes , " said @entity66			0
@entity0 analyst @entity213 contributed to this report .			0

a @entity17 official says they know of " no succession plan " now that @entity2 is dead
an expert says his deputy , @entity84 , is " not popular with colleagues "
another contender is @entity17 - born @entity115 , who is now based in @entity118
other possibilities are @entity160 , from @entity162 , and @entity176 of @entity177
