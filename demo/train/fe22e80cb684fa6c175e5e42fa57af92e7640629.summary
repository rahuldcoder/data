@entity0 -- farmers from a village in southwest @entity4 literally turned a multimillion dollar windfall into a wall of cash			1
this week , residents of @entity3 in @entity9 took delivery of blocks of money worth 13 million yuan ( $ 2.1 million ) in year - end bonuses they had earned from a rural co-operative scheme			1
residents had invested in farmland and small - scale hydropower plants since 2010			1
around 340 out of 483 households are shareholders in the small village , which has a population of less than 2,000 people			0
before they could distribute their earnings to individual residents ahead of @entity28 , they had the problem of where to store -- and guard -- it			1
chief villager , @entity32 , told local media he moved the money inside the village committee office after transporting it from the bank on monday			2
to keep the money safe , he appointed three villagers to sleep on the banknotes inside the office , while four others stood guard outside			2
" we used 800,000 yuan as a mattress , 420,000 yuan as pillows , and put the others aside , " @entity32 told the @entity43			0
the following day , the banknotes were moved into the village square and stacked to form a seven - foot long wall and create a $ 2 million photo opportunity			2
many villagers said they had never seen so much money before			2
villager @entity53 , who collected the most dividends from his investments , was delighted to finally get his hands on 300,000 yuan ( $ 49,000 ) in cash			0
" it 's so cold , and i 've been counting ( cash ) for the whole day , my fingers are all numb , " he told reporters			0
the story was an immediate hit with @entity4 's legions of @entity66 users			1
one netizen , known as " xiaomili_xiaomi " took to @entity69 , a @entity70 - like service , to post : " let 's be friends , rich villagers ! " others asked if they could join in on the investment bonanza and become a member of the rural co-operative			1
unfortunately , the scheme only allows investors who are members of @entity3 village			0
the only way to join is by marrying into the families , said @entity32			0
