-- when @entity2 went into labor last year there were complications			1
realizing she needed medical attention , she traveled from @entity7 , where she was living , to a hospital in @entity9 , in the @entity10 of her native @entity11			1
despite being one of just two hospitals serving the entire municipality , the hospital had only two doctors , each serving 29,000 people , and one nurse for every 1,500 patients			0
it had no special facilities for women and children			2
when @entity2 reached the hospital , medics realized she needed a blood transfusion , but the hospital had no blood bank , and no ventilator to give her oxygen			0
last month , her story was broadcast on @entity37 and @entity38 , @entity11 's leading tv station , to an estimated 8 - 10 million people across the country			1
it provoked strong reactions in @entity9 and prompted a major debate on four radio stations lasting several days --- bringing attention to @entity11 's staggering incidence of maternal deaths @entity11 has a reputation as a beacon of democracy in @entity51			1
that reputation has been boosted by a rapidly growing economy , and the discovery of oil on our western coastline			0
so strong are the economic indicators that analysts at the @entity59 have conferred upon us that most cherished of things -- @entity62 status			0
read more : what @entity11 can teach the rest of @entity51 about democracy but within government and civil society we know that positive headlines do n't tell the full story			1
one of the biggest challenges -- a real litmus test for @entity11 -- is whether we can significantly reduce maternal deaths across the country			1
in @entity11 , 4,000 women die every year and over 200,000 are disabled due to pregnancy related complications			1
these figures are among the highest in the world			0
if pregnancy is not a disease or death sentence , why are so many women dying or maimed in the process of giving birth ? so how can a country that basks in so much international acclaim be failing its expectant mothers and their children so badly , and what can we do to improve the situation ? for a start we have to better understand the social and cultural dimensions of maternal healthcare in @entity11 and similarly under - developed countries			1
and we must respond to them			0
to make a real difference our awareness campaigns must be aimed at changing the mindsets of our people , especially those living in the rural areas			0
while doing my research i noticed that previous campaigns were predominantly urban centered and driven by " professional " imperatives			0
they failed to include the voices of women and the poor , marginalized communities -- those that actually bear the brunt of the maternal tragedy			2
as a result key concerns have not been addressed			0
for example , most pregnant women in rural communities rely on traditional birth attendants to deliver their babies			2
however , following a @entity125 directive , the @entity123 discouraged this , urging pregnant mothers to give birth in the hospitals instead			0
but instead of getting skilled care these women have experienced overcrowded hospitals , poor facilities and an acute shortage of qualified staff			2
read more : too many mothers still dying there is also the issue of infrastructure			2
bad roads and poor transport links , exacerbated by the lack of ambulances also mean that pregnant women in emergencies can not get to the hospital on time			2
many are carried by motor bikes and local taxis over considerable distances and die en route			2
in 2009 , i directed " the lights have gone out @entity155 , " a documentary that contributed powerful new testimonies to @entity11 's maternal health debate			1
i was so moved by what i saw in the remote , isolated villages that i was determined to " humanize " the maternal death statistics and highlight concerns that are so often excluded from the regular health debate			2
the documentary was televised and screened across the country , receiving critical applause			0
it enabled us to start a fresh dialogue on maternal health and triggered our determination to find an inclusive way of mobilizing @entity11 around the need to reduce maternal deaths and improve maternal healthcare , more generally			1
we decided to use television for this new campaign because of its widespread popularity as a news and entertainment medium in both urban and rural areas of @entity11			1
many families and whole households usually gather round the box for most of the evening			0
we decided to complement television with a radio series in @entity11 languages to further extend the educational reach of the project and to maximize its impact			1
read more : the @entity191 secretary who became a @entity11 king with funding from the @entity194 , a long standing supporter of the @entity11 health sector and advice from the @entity123 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 of @entity201 's in @entity202 and others , the @entity204 and @entity205 was born at an impressive launch in @entity207 in february 2013			1
the first two shows , telling the story of @entity2 , provoked a huge response from viewers			0
significantly , we also heard contributions from health leaders at the hospital where she died			0
when the phone lines were opened , callers broadly agreed that a new partnership was needed between government , the hospitals , and the community , and that it was important to complement behavioral change with new policies			0
critically , the hospitals urgently need more skilled personnel and improved facilities			0
the media response has generally also been impressive with great coverage in the newspapers , on radio and television			1
these are exciting times for the @entity204 but it 's still early days as more people join the renewed debate about lifting @entity11 's maternal health burden			1
so , although we may miss the @entity241 to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by 75 % by 2015 , i firmly believe that by being more innovative in our campaigning we can start to turn the corner on this and so many other critical healthcare issues in the years ahead			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity249 .			1

every year in @entity11 4,000 women die and over 200,000 are disabled during pregnancy
dr. @entity249 launched a television and radio campaign to highlight the issue
@entity204 radio show broadcasts in a range of @entity11 languages
