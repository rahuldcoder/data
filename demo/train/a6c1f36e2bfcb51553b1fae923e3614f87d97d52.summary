-- one word could have a big impact on the way doctors treat obesity in the @entity6			1
the @entity7 has adopted a new policy that officially labels obesity as a disease " requiring a range of medical interventions to advance obesity treatment and prevention , " according to an @entity7 statement			1
the physicians ' group voted to approve the obesity policy , among others , on tuesday during its annual meeting in @entity20			1
the @entity6 obesity rate increased almost 50 % between 1997 and 2012 , according to the @entity22			1
today , nearly 30 % of @entity6 adults are considered obese , and the problem is almost as prevalent in kids			0
childhood obesity has more than doubled in the past 30 years , the @entity22 says			2
obesity for adults is defined as having a body mass index , or @entity29 , of 30 or higher			2
@entity29 is a way to measure body fat based on your weight and height			0
( calculate your @entity29 here ) being obese increases your risk factor for developing many serious conditions , including heart disease , type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , stroke , liver disease , sleep apnea and osteoarthritis			0
in fact , obesity has been linked to almost every chronic disease in some way or another			2
" recognizing obesity as a disease will help change the way the medical community tackles this complex issue , " @entity7 board member dr. @entity48 said in a statement			1
obesity has long been recognized as a disease by other groups , but this move by the @entity7 sends a strong signal to the medical community , said @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity58			1
some experts worry suddenly declaring one - third of @entity6 " ill " or " sick " will increase the desire for quick interventions or medications and discourage people from making the lifestyle changes known to combat obesity			1
on the other hand , @entity7 's declaration could help increase funding for future obesity research			1
it could also lead to payment for doctors who want to simply talk to patients about nutrition or exercise -- time that 's not currently reimbursed by insurance plans			0
identifying obesity as a disease may also help in reducing the stigma often associated with being overweight , said @entity80 , president and ceo of the @entity82			2
" obesity has been considered for a long time to be a failure of personal responsibility -- a simple problem of eating too much and exercising too little , " he said			2
" but it 's a complex disease ... we 're hoping attitudes will change			2
" @entity80 thinks the @entity7 's support is also an important step in helping people gain access to obesity treatment			1
most forms of insurance do not cover obesity alone			0
for instance , an obese patient can not hire a nutritionist or a trainer and have it covered by his or her plan simply to lose weight			0
" we do cover treatment connected with a co-morbidity , " says @entity105 , a spokesman for the @entity106			0
" for example , if you have diabetes and obesity is aggravating the diabetes , we might cover obesity treatment as a way of treating the diabetes			0
" obesity - related health care expenses cost @entity6 between $ 147 billion to $ 210 billion per year			1
preventing and treating obesity before it leads to more serious diseases could help combat these costs , @entity80 says			0
@entity7 's decision comes at an interesting time			1
the @entity82 has been working to introduce the treat and @entity124 in @entity125			0
the bill was re-introduced in the @entity127 on wednesday and will be re-introduced in the @entity128 on wednesday afternoon , according to the office of sen. @entity130 , @entity131 , one of the measure 's sponsors			0
a similar bill last year stalled in committee			0
the bill would increase obesity treatment options for @entity138 patients , expand the types of providers who can offer obesity counseling and take away some obesity medication limits .			1
