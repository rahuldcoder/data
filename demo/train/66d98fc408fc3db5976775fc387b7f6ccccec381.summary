-- @entity2 history is replete with examples of people who try to build a reputation by standing in the way of presidential initiatives			0
we see that today with @entity10 sen. @entity9 of @entity11 , who is acting as if he believes that , aided by a small group of tea party - supported members of @entity15 , he can force the president to do his bidding by shutting down the government			2
in this respect , @entity9 is like @entity20 , the @entity21 senator and depression - era demagogue			1
@entity20 believed that he could gain a national following by being a thorn in the side of president @entity26			1
@entity9 -- who , like @entity20 , revels in the use of the filibuster -- appears to think that he can do the same by being a thorn in the side of president @entity31 , whose @entity33 he is seeking to derail			1
@entity9 routinely says that he does not want a government shutdown , but he continues to encourage @entity36 members to refuse a continuing resolution vote that would let the government get back to business as usual			2
in a sunday interview on @entity0 's " @entity41 " with @entity42 , @entity9 rejected the idea that an alternative to shutting down the government would be for him and his fellow tea party supporters to persuade @entity15 to repeal the @entity33 in a straight up - or - down vote			1
the situation , @entity9 told @entity42 , was too dire to rely on the normal legislative process to settle matters			2
if @entity33 is enacted , " it 's going to destroy the private health insurance system , " @entity9 predicted			1
the only alternative , he contended , was for the @entity54 to force a government shutdown until the president and the @entity57 made more concessions on the @entity33			2
@entity9 : @entity60 ' new bogeyman as for his actions hurting what @entity42 called " the @entity10 brand , " @entity9 had a confident , two - word answer : " not remotely			0
" for @entity20 , annoying the president was great fun			0
he helped get the @entity57 to reject the treaty that would have brought the @entity2 into the @entity68 , and he launched an unsuccessful effort to make employees of the @entity72 subject to @entity57 confirmation			0
the problem was that @entity20 often went beyond being annoying with his obstructionism			0
the classic case of @entity20 not caring about the consequences of his actions occurred in august 1935 as @entity15 was getting ready to adjourn			2
@entity20 conducted a filibuster against an otherwise routine deficiency - appropriation bill , because he believed the bill did not help wheat and cotton farmers enough			0
when @entity57 colleagues told @entity20 , who earlier in the summer had filibustered for over 15 hours , that his actions would also deprive the government of funds for railroad pensions and @entity88 welfare projects , he ignored them			0
as a result , the deficiency - appropriation bill was killed , and among those hurt by its failure to pass the @entity57 were many of those most vulnerable to the @entity93			0
@entity20 , a @entity94 , was assassinated in september 1935 when he returned to @entity21 for a special session of the state legislature , but his rear - guard action against @entity26 and the @entity88 did not go unnoticed by @entity26 's foes on the right			1
after @entity15 passed the @entity101 in 1935 , @entity10 and their supporters did everything they could to prevent it from being implemented in january 1937 , much as the @entity36 is trying to do now with @entity33 in the 1936 elections , @entity103 , the @entity10 presidential nominee , called @entity101 a " cruel hoax " and announced " the @entity10 will have nothing to do with any plan that involves prying into the personal records of 26 million people			1
" opinion : four ways for @entity31 to lead @entity2 out of crisis as far as @entity26 was concerned , the eleventh - hour political attacks against @entity101 were different from the partisan campaigns both parties had previously waged			1
@entity26 refused to give his opponents credit for acting in good faith and he refused to waver in his defense of @entity101			1
@entity26 's resolution paid off			1
he won the 1936 election in a landslide , carrying all but two states , @entity123 and @entity124			0
he even increased his majority in @entity15			0
@entity31 is not the campaigner that @entity26 was , but he does not have to be when it comes to refusing to let his @entity33 be made a hostage to the threat of a long government shutdown			1
the most recent @entity133 shows that nearly three - quarters of all voters , 72 % , oppose a government shutdown designed to stop or weaken the @entity33			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			0

@entity139 : @entity9 has acted to *enhance* his reputation , *heedless* of consequences
he says @entity26 's *critics* , *including* @entity20 , specialized in such obstruction
@entity147 : if @entity9 wants to repeal @entity33 , he should seek to do it in normal vote
he says @entity26 's firm stance in defense of @entity101 was *vindicated*
