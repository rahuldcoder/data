-- imagine if every time you went to the pharmacy , shopping for medications was a complete guessing game			0
what if drug makers were n't required to disclose ingredients in their products or prove their safety , leaving you without a way to determine whether what you 're buying is safe for you and your family ? you would live in fear that the medicine you purchased to make your child feel better could actually harm them			2
it 's a frightening scenario , and one that we would never accept			0
yet , because of our outdated and broken toxic chemicals law , that is precisely the situation with the consumer products we use every day			1
these products -- from baby bottles and shampoo to car seats and sofas -- contain tens of thousands of untested chemicals			1
last week , i joined with hundreds of moms from across the country to sound the alarm and call on @entity35 to fix this broken law			1
these parents came to @entity38 because they 're worried that the chemicals found in these ordinary products are putting their families ' health at risk			1
they 're right to worry , because in recent studies , scientists at the @entity46 found 212 industrial chemicals -- including six cancer - causing chemicals -- coursing through @entity52 ' bodies			1
in essence , the @entity52 public has become a living , breathing repository for toxic chemical substances			1
these chemicals have been linked to numerous diseases			0
studies show as much as 5 % of childhood cancers , 10 % of neurobehavioral disorders and 30 % of childhood asthma cases are associated with hazardous chemicals			0
the existing law that regulates chemical safety , the @entity67 , was written in the 1970s and is ineffective and outdated			1
in nearly 35 years , it has allowed the @entity69 to require testing of only 200 of the more than 80,000 chemicals in its inventory			0
what 's more , @entity69 has been able to ban only five substances			0
the law is so broken that when @entity69 tried to ban uses of asbestos , a known cancer - causing chemical , its rules were overturned in court			0
this status quo is dangerous and unacceptable			0
that 's why i 've introduced a bill called the @entity87 , which simply requires that chemical makers prove their chemicals are safe before they end up in our products and bodies			1
it would ensure that chemicals are tested and that those deemed dangerous are taken off the market			2
but sadly , some chemical companies and their lobbyists are fighting reform at every turn			1
just recently , the @entity101 exposed a concerted effort by some chemical companies to use dirty tricks and junk science to mislead the public about the dangers of their products			0
the report detailed how industry bankrolled experts who testified with fake stories , all in an effort to protect the health of their profits instead of the health of our families and children			0
they 've specifically fought to protect flame retardant chemicals such as chlorinated @entity123 , which is so dangerous that companies voluntarily stopped using it in children 's pajamas more than 30 years ago			2
but while scientists have warned us about chemicals such as chlorinated @entity123 since the 1970s , they continue to be used in products all around us , including furniture , cribs , mattresses and high - chair cushions			1
now , let 's be clear : the @entity87 is not an attack on chemicals			1
chemicals are used in hundreds of useful products , and most of the thousands of chemicals we use everyday are safe			2
but we need to be able to separate the safe from the dangerous			0
under our current law , we ca n't do that			0
that 's what this bill fixes			0
the chemical industry 's lobbyists argue that the cost of testing all these chemicals would be too high			2
but what is the cost of our children 's health ? for three years , i 've invited input from all sides of this issue , including the chemical industry			0
but despite claims of interest in reform , industry lobbyists are refusing to offer concrete suggestions and trying to run out the clock on our efforts			2
we can not accept inaction any longer			1
it is time to come together to finally fix this law and protect our families from toxic chemicals once and for all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

sen. @entity182 : @entity35 needs to fix our outdated toxic chemicals law
he says ordinary products such as cribs and couches contain dangerous chemicals
@entity182 : my @entity87 can help reduce the health risks for @entity52
lobbyists are fighting reform , but we can not accept inaction any longer , says @entity182
