" march 's bus crash was a tragedy for @entity8 , but these passengers did not have to die in vain , " @entity9 said in a statement sunday			1
" a full and comprehensive review of this industry and the safety regulations governing it will no doubt lead to greater safety standards for the thousands of passengers who use these buses every week			1
" " by ensuring @entity2 thoroughly reviews how this industry is regulated , we can keep passengers safe , while restoring consumers ' confidence in this type of travel , " @entity32 said in the statement			1
a similar @entity2 review of airline safety " led to major improvements , " the joint statement by the lawmakers ' offices said			1
@entity9 has also asked @entity8 's @entity45 to re-examine all drivers of low - cost tour buses for previous safety violations and suspended licenses			1
if such an audit had taken place before the march 12 crash , it would have shown that the driver " should n't have been behind the wheel , " @entity9 said			1
@entity8 gov. @entity56 ordered an investigation into how the driver in the crash , @entity60 , got a commercial license despite having a poor driving record and previous convictions of grand larceny and manslaughter			1
records on the @entity68 website showed that the bus line involved -- @entity70 -- was involved in a crash in @entity8 in 2009 that resulted in one injury and a crash in @entity74 in 2010 resulting in another			2
the company has been cited five times for " fatigued driving " between december 2009 and october 2010 -- twice in @entity74 , twice in @entity79 and once in @entity80 , records show			0
police said @entity60 told investigators that the incident occurred the morning of march 12 after he swerved to avoid a tractor - trailer that might have clipped the bus			0
the bus then flipped on its side and smashed into poles , which cut through two - thirds of the vehicle			0
@entity60 has not been charged			0
his license was suspended on march 17 after the @entity45 turned over to investigators driver license applications that allegedly contained false statements			2
two survivors of the @entity96 bus accident have filed multimillion - dollar lawsuits against the bus company and against @entity60			1
@entity99 and @entity100 are suing @entity101 and @entity60 for $ 20 million and $ 200 million , respectively			0
both passengers ' court papers allege negligence on the part of the bus operating company for allowing @entity60 behind the wheel , with that resulting in the deadly crash on march 12			0
they also allege that @entity60 was speeding and fell asleep while driving			0
@entity60 ' lawyer , @entity110 , has denied that his client fell asleep behind the wheel			0
he also said @entity60 does not drink , smoke or use drugs and had passed three breathalyzer tests and given a blood sample following the crash			0
@entity118 called his client an " easy target , " but insisted that he is " a decent person			0
" the case has shone light on safety questions surrounding the industry			0
on one day in march , the state @entity124 inspected 14 buses and found violations in every case -- either vehicle violations , which took the buses out of service , or driver violations or both , said agency spokeswoman @entity134			2
the nine driver violations could include anything from a driver with an out - of - date license to one who had logged too many hours on the road , @entity134 said			1
on another day in march , random roadside inspections of 36 commercial buses by troopers resulted in 10 drivers being removed from their buses by their companies and eight traffic tickets issued			2
none of the vehicles inspected was found inoperable , according to the @entity150 .			0
