-- the @entity1 is hoping to do some tricky medicine on the world at large			1
it 's trying to stop the planet 's lungs from collapsing			2
" if you think of the world as having two lungs , the @entity8 rainforest is one lung , and the @entity14 forest is the second			2
it 's a place everyone should be concerned about in a time of climate change , " says @entity16 , the organization 's ceo			2
the @entity14 is also home to the bonobo , forest elephants and @entity14 peacocks -- species whose survival is dependent on that of the surrounding forest			2
@entity16 has launched an innovative program to save the environment , not just the one region , but on the whole @entity34 continent -- the cradle of civilization and potentially its ecological safe keeper			1
over the next decade , the @entity1 is building 15 conservation - themed primary schools in some of @entity34 's most remote regions -- areas that are also highly strategic from an environmental standpoint			1
the schools are designed to be state - of - the - art , built with attractive faculty housing that will hopefully lure some of @entity34 's best teachers			1
in exchange , the organization not only helps to shape young minds to further the cause , but gets written agreement from the local community to set aside a patch of land for conservation purposes -- a stretch that will be free form hunting , logging and unplanned agriculture			1
" it 's a bargaining tool , " admits @entity16			0
" [ these communities ] are rich in land , but poor in cash			1
we brought in a resource to help build a school , and we barter			0
" education in the @entity67 @entity16 notes that when it comes to education in @entity34 , resources go first to schools in the city , then to those in the surrounding towns			1
" kids that live in the @entity67 are likely to be deeply disadvantaged , " he says			1
it is precisely that segment , he argues , that needs access to good schooling to protect the future of the continent			1
" when children do not get access to a good education , they 're doomed to a life where exploiting natural resources is the only way to make a livelihood			0
if you ca n't get a skill or a job that allows you to enter the modern economy , harvesting bush meat , cutting trees -- these are your only options , " he says			0
sustainable schooling construction has already begun on the first school in @entity101 , an extremely isolated village in the @entity102 that sits on the corridor between two protected areas			0
" we work in a lot of parts of @entity34 that are remote , but this takes the cake , " says @entity16			1
getting there involves a two - day motorized canoe trip from @entity112 , followed by a five - hour motorcycle ride			0
what that means is that getting materials in and out of the area can prove troublesome			0
architectural firm @entity118 has partnered with the @entity1 to build the schools			1
for the @entity122 project , it was imperative that the designers used materials that are easy to source and replace			0
" if there 's a need to repair or maintain the school 45 years down the road , the community has to be able to do it without depending on materials like steel or cement , which would be hard to locate , " says @entity125 , the project manager			0
@entity135 started by researching not just the materials in the region , but local construction methods			1
" we 've found that when you go into remote regions like this , the things people build are already climate - intellegent			0
they know how to build with rainfall in mind , " says @entity145 , ceo of @entity135			0
" we look at how we can adapt and learn from what 's already done quite well in the area			0
" the school is built primarily from mud bricks and local hardwood			1
@entity125 's team tested different soils and palm oils in the region to find which combination of ingredients would yield the most durable bricks			0
factoring in the rainforest climate , which is prone to heavy rains and high heat , the school walls only go up two - thirds of the way to allow for cross breeze			0
rain catchments will store water for agricultural uses			0
" this building is one of the most sustainable we 've ever built , " says @entity145			1
a portal to the ' modern economy ' like @entity16 , @entity145 views the schools project as a means to really impact the continent			2
" our ambition is to have more systemic change through a better building process			2
it 's not just a one - off project , " he admits			0
for starters , @entity135 has trained local craftsmen in its techniques as a way of passing on the baton			2
" they could build tens of thousands of schools in the next decade , " says @entity145			2
" as the population booms significantly in @entity34 , there will be a massive demand for low - cost , rural school construction			1

the @entity1 is building conservation schools in rural @entity34
it barters with local communities for land to protect
partnered with @entity118 , it is bringing better schools to the @entity67
