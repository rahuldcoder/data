-- three - time major winner @entity1 fired his best score this year to take the halfway lead at the @entity4 in @entity5 , and then claimed he would be happy to be paired with @entity6 when the disgraced world no. 1 makes his golfing comeback at the masters			1
the @entity10 , whose last victory on the @entity12 came at the @entity13 in 2008 , carded six - under - par 65 on friday to move a shot clear of defending champion @entity15 , @entity17 's @entity16 and @entity6 ' fellow @entity19 @entity18 and @entity20			1
asked if he would relish the opportunity to be paired with @entity23 at @entity24 next month when the fallen superstar returns following his admissions of marital infidelities , the 38 - year - old said he could handle the attendant pressures of such an occasion			1
" if there is an issue being drawn with him in his first tournament back , if you 're going to choose a golf course for it to happen , @entity24 is the place , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" it is as ordered as can be there , so i for one would be quite comfortable if i got drawn with @entity6			1
i do not see it being any different than being drawn with him the first two rounds last year			2
" i do believe , though , if it was first two rounds at @entity45 , that would be slightly different			2
but then again , you would n't mind being there to watch it all ! " @entity1 is seeking to build on last weekend 's third placing at the @entity51 in @entity52 , which was won by @entity54 veteran @entity53 , ahead of this season 's first major tournament			2
the two - time @entity58 champion was four shots adrift of first - round leader @entity60 after an opening 69 at the @entity63 course in @entity64 on thursday , having missed the pro-am to attend president @entity68 's @entity67 dinner at the @entity69			0
he carded five birdies and a bogey on his front nine , and picked up shots at 11 and 16 to be on eight - under 134			0
@entity54 's @entity15 , himself a two - time major winner , followed up his 67 with a 68 -- with @entity16 and @entity18 doing exactly the same			0
@entity20 moved up the leaderboard with an eight - birdie 65 as he overcame successive birdies midway through his front nine to join the others on 135			0
world no. 2 @entity79 was tied for sixth after his 66 left him level with fellow @entity19 @entity82 ( 68 ) and @entity84 's @entity83 ( 68 ) on 136			1
@entity60 slumped to a tie for 66th after a horrendous 77 which saw him double - bogey the first two holes , drop another shot at the third and then card another double at the ninth and a bogey at 11			0
@entity94 victor @entity93 missed the cut of 143 by three shots after a second successive 73 , while @entity101 @entity58 champion @entity100 , fellow major winner @entity97 and young @entity99 star @entity98 also failed to make the weekend rounds .			0
