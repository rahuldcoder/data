@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the top of a flight of stairs with no elevator in sight , registered nurse @entity3 leans over the rickety metal bars of a crib			0
her 4 - year - old patient , a ventilator tube fastened to his throat , reaches out to take her hand			2
" it 's hard to work as a nurse in @entity1 , " said @entity3 , 25			0
since she began her career at the @entity20 in the western @entity1 city of @entity0 , little funding and outdated machinery have only been part of the problem			1
" there are not enough nurses , and you have to do everything , " she said			0
" and there is little money and low prestige			1
" @entity32 salaries and demanding hours for nurses , however , are not purely a @entity1 problem			1
throughout @entity36 , the nursing profession is rapidly losing its appeal			1
an aging workforce and dwindling student enrollment in nursing schools are precipitating a looming nursing crisis			1
add to that an economic recession and more seniors requiring long - term care , and @entity36 may be facing a shortage of 1 million health professionals by 2020 , according to a @entity48 on @entity50 estimate			1
" people are leaving the profession because they ca n't stand the difficult work anymore , " said @entity51 , secretary general of the @entity52 , which represents the interests of nurses in 27 @entity56 countries			1
" the young generation thinks you must be a fool to go into nursing			2
" it 's actually bad all over : @entity64 , too , may have 1.2 million job openings for nurses , due to job growth and replacements , by 2020 , according to the @entity64 @entity69			1
however , @entity51 believes the @entity64 can serve as an example for @entity36 , as president @entity72 's administration has committed to improving working conditions			1
when the @entity75 takes full effect in 2014 , nursing may soon become a more attractive career option in the @entity64			1
as part of the @entity75 , in addition to loan forgiveness programs , nurses will receive increased financial support for pursuing training programs and obtaining advanced certification			0
your health care is covered , but who 's going to treat you ? but in @entity36 , a clear - cut solution to the nursing crisis may prove to be elusive , as governments and international organizations have very different approaches to dealing with the problem			1
in countries such as the @entity96 , which expects a nursing shortage within the next five years , the focus is on disease prevention and public health to reduce the overall number of patients			1
according to @entity103 , chief executive at the @entity96 's @entity104 , an organization providing research and advice on workforce planning , recruiters should encourage nurses who left the job market due to family commitments to return to the workforce			0
another plan is to train experienced nurses to take on greater responsibilities			0
" a doctor costs more than four times a nurse , " @entity103 said			0
" if you do n't spend as much on doctors , you can spend more on nursing			2
" in other countries , such as @entity123 , the shortage is particularly acute , and the immigration of health care workers from poorer economies even outside of @entity36 is becoming part of the solution			1
" we expect a tremendous nursing shortage of about 500,000 people by 2030 , " said professor @entity129 , managing director of the @entity130 and @entity131 at the @entity132			1
" even if the profession were more attractive , there just are n't enough young people due to declining birth rates			0
" in an attempt to alleviate the shortage , the @entity140 , a health employer 's union in @entity142 , has come up with an idea -- enlisting nurses from @entity147			2
in cooperation with the @entity150 , an experimental project has recruited an initial 150 nurses from @entity147 to work in hospitals and nursing homes beginning in early 2014			2
this month , at the @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity147 , the nurses selected for the program are beginning their eight - month training in @entity123 life , culture , and language			2
" the nurses learn international standards for caring , washing the elderly , and physical therapy , " said @entity162 , marketing executive of the government - sanctioned nursing center			1
the training center , which opened in 2001 , has more than 400 students a year and has sent its graduates to countries such as @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175			0
as part of the curriculum , the nurses destined for @entity123 have begun absorbing the tenets of @entity123 culture to ensure a smooth transition into western society			0
" recently , we had a lecture on garbage and recycling , " @entity162 said			0
" it 's very complicated in @entity123			0
" to create a more unified response to the nursing crisis on a @entity56 level , the @entity48 on @entity50 , funded in part by the @entity188 , recently launched a project to foster international cooperation			1
beginning this month , its agenda will also focus on the increasing mobility of nurses throughout @entity36 and its potential social and economic impact			1
as the member states of the @entity48 begin to meet , some have expressed concern that the migration of nurses within @entity36 may have unintended consequences			1
" @entity205 and @entity1 are worried that their workforce is being poached by richer countries , " said @entity103 , who attended the first @entity48 session in @entity204 in april			0
while weaker economies fear losing their best and brightest workers , wealthier countries worry about a potential influx of job seekers in a time when @entity36 is still in the throes of a recession			2
this scenario could become a reality in january 2014 , when the @entity56 countries of @entity220 and @entity221 gain unrestricted access to the @entity223			2
the migration of nurses is further exacerbated by a significant wage disparity within @entity36			2
while a nurse in the @entity96 can expect a salary of about $ 2,800 a month , according to @entity230 estimates , a nurse in @entity220 can earn less than $ 200			0
back in @entity1 , about 500 nurses have requested official certificates to seek employment abroad over the past decade , said @entity234 , head of the self - governing @entity235 of nurses in @entity0			2
in an area of only 3.5 million inhabitants , this would be enough to staff two large hospitals			0
@entity3 , the nurse at the children 's intensive care unit in @entity0 , said she loves working with children			0
but would she consider moving to a better - paying country ? she hesitates			0
in the small ward -- its walls painted a cheerful green -- her young patients lay motionless beneath the bulky , dated ventilator machines			0
" maybe , " she says .			0

low salaries , little prestige and *meager* funding contribute to @entity56 nursing shortage
the looming crisis is comparable to that in the @entity64
but officials say the @entity72 administration is targeting the problem
in @entity36 , no clear - cut solution appears forthcoming
