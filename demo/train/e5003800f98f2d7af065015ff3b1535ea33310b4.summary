-- as @entity3 as fireworks in july , official state flowers honor the natural diversity of our country			1
the idea dates back to 1893 , when , for a national garland at the @entity10 , each state was asked to nominate a floral emblem			1
the sunflower was a shoo - in for @entity13 , suggesting " the majesty of a golden future			0
" but debates raged in other states as they struggled for consensus on a single bloom			0
in some close contests , legislators turned to botanists to break a tie			1
or they consulted schoolchildren , who , in @entity25 , chose the @entity27 columbine and , in @entity28 , the violet			1
most of these picks are common natives that bloom on summer roadsides or are familiar transplants , comfortably at home in their adopted state			1
many are also such great all - around garden plants that — no matter where you live — they 'll thrive with little fuss , adding notes of carefree @entity43 to your landscape			0
no bloom holds more titles than the rose			1
it 's an official emblem for @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53 , as well as the national flower of the @entity3 here , we present 15 state flowers ( find the 35 other state flowers at @entity0 ) , along with growing tips and recommended varieties			1
show off your national pride with these favorites			1
@entity63 : @entity64 though native to @entity66 , the camellia replaced goldenrod as @entity63 's state flower in 1927 , when the ladies of the state successfully lobbied for the change because they felt its elegance was more appropriate than the wildflower 's weed - like looks			1
@entity64 , with its glossy evergreen leaves and large cupped flowers , blooms when few other plants do — in late winter to early spring			0
plant partial - shade - loving camellias such as ' @entity84 , ' shown here , in slightly acidic soil that drains well			0
this @entity86 @entity87 : @entity88 before statehood , @entity87 's territorial legislature picked the wild forget - me - not as its bloom , calling it " the emblem of the pioneers upon the rugged trail " in the bill 's descriptive marginalia			1
with its mounding habit and flocks of true - blue spring and summer flowers , it 's a charming filler around bulbs and in rock gardens or containers			1
fragrant at night , the self - sowing perennial thrives in full to dappled sun and moist , free - draining soil			0
the cultivar ' @entity108 ' ( shown ) has a more compact habit than the species , growing only 6 inches high and a foot across			0
@entity113 : @entity114 even before @entity113 achieved statehood , the saguaro cactus blossom was selected as the territory 's symbol , in 1901 ; its status was officially signed into law 30 years later			2
this fragrant , creamy white flower blooms from the tips of saguaro cacti in late spring , opening up at night and early into the morning			2
it is found exclusively in the @entity126			0
this @entity0 : @entity127 @entity128 : @entity129 coronaria at one time a major apple - producing state , @entity128 decreed the apple blossom its official flower in 1901			1
the pink - and - white blooms of @entity134 ( @entity3 crabapple tree , shown ) are extremely fragrant , appearing march through may , followed in september by clusters of light green to reddish bitter fruits			1
the tree 's relatively small height ( 6 to 14 feet ) and three seasons of interest make it a good candidate for a focal point in the residential landscape			1
@entity146 : @entity147 by the 1700s , when @entity150 sailors dubbed poppy - blanketed @entity146 the " land of fire , " indigenous peoples had long valued the wildflower for food and medicine			0
emblematic of the @entity157 , it 's a drought - tolerant , easy - to - sow perennial in mild climates and a winning annual elsewhere , blooming in spring sunshine and closing at night			2
@entity161 seeds in well - drained soil and pull most plants once they 've faded , but let some go to seed			0
the most familiar @entity146 poppy is orange - gold , but selections range widely : ' @entity168 ' has red ruffles with white centers , ' @entity169 ' is a semi-double mix of hues ( shown ) , and ' @entity173 ' is yellow - cream			2
this @entity0 : vibrant @entity175 for a @entity176 @entity25 : @entity177 @entity178 stands for sky , white for snow , and yellow for the state 's gold - mining history in this hardy perennial , which got the @entity25 children 's vote in 1899			1
later , " @entity189 " became the state song , enhancing the appeal of the fragrant wildlife magnet			2
if you sow seeds in fall , the plants sprout in spring but take another year to bloom			0
for a head start , plant seedlings in spring , keep them moist , and deadhead flowers to encourage more			0
though the @entity25 native ( shown ) is the familiar blue and white , cultivars include dwarf variety ' @entity200 ' and multihued ' @entity201 ' @entity202 : @entity203 this fragrant , star - shaped flower was first recorded in @entity3 in 1624 by captain @entity205 and was designated @entity202 's state flower in 1907			1
a plant with a past — @entity209 made spoons from the wood — this dense evergreen shrub adapts to a variety of light conditions ( partial shade to full sun )			0
mountain laurel blooms from late spring to midsummer			0
all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested , so keep away from children and pets			2
this @entity0 : @entity222 to make an entrance @entity224 : @entity225 prunus persica in the late 19th century , @entity224 's orchards were producing so many peaches — more than 800,000 fruits annually — that the state came to be known as the @entity50			1
this moniker prompted lawmakers to pass an act , in 1895 , adopting the peach blossom as the state flower			1
a deciduous tree with glossy leaves that follow showy spring flowers , it grows to a modest 25 feet tall , making it a good candidate for a backyard orchard in warmer zones			0
@entity243 : @entity244 @entity245 adopted as the state flower by the legislature in 1909 , millions of these legendarily fragrant white flowers scent the air throughout central and south @entity243 each spring			1
upright , pyramidal flower clusters turn into fruit the following autumn or winter			2
a compact , evergreen tree that 's easy to grow in warmer climates , this citrus tree can be successfully grown as an indoor plant where winters dip below freezing			2
this @entity0 : avoid invasives : plant this , not that @entity50 : @entity261 this spring bloomer achieved state - flower status in 1916 under the false impression that it was native to the region			1
despite its @entity267 origins , the rose has grown naturally throughout the southeast for centuries and became a symbol of hope to the @entity272 who were forced to march the infamous @entity274 in 1838			2
the sprawling climber easily reaches 20 feet in height , and while its sweet - scented flowers are fleeting , its plump orange hips and evergreen foliage offer color in later seasons			0
@entity281 : @entity282 though the hibiscus was designated the territorial flower in 1922 , it was n't until 1988 that the particular species @entity286 was chosen by the @entity281 state legislature			1
a sun - loving , profuse bloomer , this shrub is covered in large , pure yellow flowers in spring and early summer			0
due to its status on the federal endangered species list , @entity292 are encouraged to plant this hibiscus , known to the locals as ma'o hau hele , in their home gardens			0
this @entity0 : grow a @entity298 @entity299 : @entity301 's @entity300 lewisii first discovered and collected by @entity301 — half of the famed explorer duo — and noted in his journal in 1806 , this deciduous shrub was a favorite of @entity209 for making bows , arrows , cradles , and other utilitarian goods			2
designated @entity299 's state flower over a decade later , in 1931 , @entity311 grows in full sun or partial shade and tops out at about 10 feet tall			1
clusters of small white flowers with a rich orange - blossom scent bloom from late spring to midsummer			0
@entity318 : @entity319 voted in by schoolchildren in 1908 , the native wildflower , with its purple - to - white - petaled blooms and heart - shaped leaves , is a common sight in the state 's fields and woodlands			1
despite its dainty appearance , the violet makes a tough garden plant			0
the self - sowing groundcover is highly deer resistant , tolerates clay soil , and thrives in full sun in cooler climates or partial shade in warmer zones			0
@entity337 : peony @entity338 the peony was designated the @entity337 's flower in 1957			1
it was the fourth different bloom to hold the title in less than 100 years , replacing the carnation , the flower of the tulip tree , and the zinnia			2
once established , peonies are winter hardy , relatively pest - free , and can live for 50 years or longer			0
early - summer bloomers , peony blossoms may be single , semi-double , or double ( such as ' @entity353 , ' shown ) , in a range of colors from white to pink to dark red			0
