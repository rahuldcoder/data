-- in a long - awaited speech thursday in @entity3 , president @entity1 will boldly go where no president has gone before , laying out an entirely new vision for the @entity8 space program			1
the firestorm of controversy has already begun for more than 50 years , presidents have pushed for government rockets to send astronauts to space , the moon and possibly @entity16			1
but now a new paradigm is being proposed			0
the moon program is off the table , and @entity16 is only a distant possibility			2
@entity21 is essentially getting out of the astronaut business , letting the @entity23 and private enterprise take over			1
the glory days of @entity21 , some say , are over			1
the @entity1 plan is truly breathtaking , ending an era that lasted from presidents @entity29 to @entity30			1
some specifics : the moon program , called @entity33 , is being suspended , and its components and $ 9 billion of research are going down the drain			2
the @entity38 rocket , which recently underwent a successful preliminary test , will be canceled			0
the @entity41 lunar module will be repurposed as an astronaut " lifeboat " tethered to the international space station			2
the space shuttle program is ending , causing 4,600 workers to lose their jobs			1
( this was also in the @entity30 plan , but that proposal included funding the @entity38 rocket			0
) without a space shuttle , the @entity8 will rely temporarily on @entity23 rockets to send our astronauts into space			1
eventually , private enterprise will take over launching our astronauts			1
some critics say that this is all too much , too soon			2
private companies may not be ready to pick up the slack for years to transport astronauts			1
conceivably , any political crisis with the @entity23 in far - away places , such as the @entity64 , might affect our access to outer space			1
and we will just have to swallow our pride when the @entity69 plant their flag on the moon sometime after 2020 , as they say they will			0
proponents of the plan @entity1 is expected to describe , however , say that it is long overdue and inevitable			2
in these trying financial times , the @entity8 can not sustain an ambitious space program			1
get real , they say			0
let private enterprise take over			0
it 's the @entity8 way			0
but everyone agrees that the wheel is broken and needs to be fixed			0
it all boils down to one dirty four - letter word : cost			0
during the @entity90 , the superpowers gladly opened their treasuries because the space race was a matter of national pride and honor			0
since then , the realities have sunk in			0
it costs about $ 10,000 per pound to send anything into near - @entity100 orbit			0
( think of @entity102 made of solid gold			0
) but when you add in life support and safety factors , it costs about $ 65 million to send each astronaut aboard the space shuttle , which in turn costs half a billion dollars per launch			2
to go to the moon would cost perhaps 10 times as much			0
there are some positive recommendations that @entity1 should keep in mind as he plots the future of the space program			1
@entity21 needs to set concrete goals and deadlines			1
in the past , the space shuttle and the international space station were used to justify each other 's existence			2
instead , the space program should hold the feet of the bureaucracies and corporations to the fire			1
having a tangible vision of the future , with a clear destination and mission , will hold planners accountable , give a sharp focus to the objectives of the space program and cut waste			1
@entity21 has to abandon its cost - plus model , where it guarantees its contractors a profit beyond the cost			2
this model is unsustainable -- the tail wagging the dog			0
it 's an open invitation for bureaucracies and corporations to pad their budgets , rather than operate as efficiently as possible			0
@entity21 has to inspire competition and innovation			2
the @entity151 and the robotic missions to the planets have been a shining beacon for research based on goals set by scientists instead of the narrow priorities of bureaucracies and politicians			1
@entity21 has to fund risky , out - of - the - box propulsion systems -- besides the expensive chemical rockets that are used now -- to help drive down the cost of space travel			1
a lot of a rocket 's fuel goes into lifting itself into orbit , which is a waste			0
ground - based laser and microwave beams , for example , can vaporize water contained in a rocket , which is then shot out the other end , so only the payload goes into space , not the fuel			0
as he speaks to aerospace workers , the president should frame this moment as an opportunity to redesign the space program			1
the key is to maintain the @entity8 as the leader in innovation , ideas and progress , because science is ultimately the engine of prosperity			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity195 : president @entity1 's changes to space program alter vision that 's held for 50 years
@entity195 says cuts and new priorities make some critics believe @entity21 's glory years over
@entity195 : program must rely on @entity23 until private firms can get our astronauts back in space
@entity195 : @entity21 must *streamline* operating costs , innovate and set concrete goals for the future
