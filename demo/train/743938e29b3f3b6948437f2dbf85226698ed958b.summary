-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 on sunday defended recent legislation that requires adults applying for welfare assistance to undergo drug screenings , saying the law provides " personal accountability			1
" " it 's not right for taxpayer money to be paying for somebody 's drug addiction , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity9 on sunday			1
" on top of that , this is going to increase personal responsibility , personal accountability			0
we should n't be subsidizing people 's addiction			1
" but the @entity22 of @entity2 , which has already filed suit against @entity1 over a measure requiring government employees to undergo random drug testing , disagrees , and may sue over the welfare law as well			1
" @entity29 ( @entity1 ) is doing is giving ugly legitimacy to an unfortunate stereotype that has been in this country for a couple of decades -- that all welfare recipients are a bunch of drug abusers , " said @entity28 , executive director of the @entity22 of @entity2			1
@entity1 told @entity0 he wants to ensure that welfare funds go to their primary target -- to disadvantaged children -- and provide people with an incentive not to use drugs			2
he signed the measure on june 1 , calling it " the right thing for taxpayers			0
" under the law , which takes effect on july 1 , the @entity2 @entity47 will be required to conduct the drug tests on adults applying to the federal @entity53 program			1
the aid recipients would be responsible for the cost of the screening , which they would recoup in their assistance if they qualify			0
those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to receive the benefits on behalf of their children , and do not receive a refund for the test			0
shortly after the bill was signed , five democrats from the state 's congressional delegation issued a joint statement attacking the legislation , one calling it " downright unconstitutional			0
" " governor @entity1 's new drug testing law is not only an affront to families in need and detrimental to our nation 's ongoing economic recovery , it is downright unconstitutional , " said rep. @entity71			2
" if governor @entity1 wants to drug test recipients of @entity53 benefits , where does he draw the line ? are families receiving @entity85 , state emergency relief , or educational grants and loans next ? " " i work for the @entity22 , and it 's our job to prevent trampling on the constitutional rights of people , " @entity28 said			1
the @entity93 mandates that searches can not be conducted without probable cause , he said			0
controversy over the measure was heightened by @entity1 's past association with a company he co-founded that operates walk - in urgent care clinics in @entity2 and counts drug screening among the services it provides			1
in april , @entity1 , who had transferred his ownership interest in @entity106 to a trust in his wife 's name , said the company would not contract for state business , according to local media reports			2
asked about the company sunday , @entity1 said he is in the process of selling his family 's interest in the company and " it will be sold in a couple of weeks			2
" there is no conflict of interest , he said			0
on may 18 , the @entity122 ruled that two conflict - of - interest complaints against @entity1 were legally insufficient to warrant investigation , and adopted an opinion that no " prohibited conflict of interest " existed			0
on the measure requiring public employees to undergo drug testing , @entity28 noted that public employees -- workers in city , county , state and federal government -- are protected by the @entity93 and should not undergo " intrusive " drug testing without probable cause to believe a person is using drugs .			0
