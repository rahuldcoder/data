@entity0 -- for sale : @entity0 apartment with sweeping sea views and three rooms , all signs of a recent grisly murder in the bathroom eliminated , will take offers between 15 - 20 % below market value			1
in @entity0 , where superstitions can make or break a property deal , a real estate advertisement like this is not beyond the realms of the fantastic			1
with the local property market showing signs of cooling , almost every angle is worked to increase yields , and a trade in so - called haunted houses is now a visible feature of the market			1
" there are a group of people that go around and bid on them , " explains @entity24 , a realtor with @entity0 's @entity25			1
" @entity30 people , especially in @entity0 , do n't like houses where something unfortunate has happened			1
see a list of ' haunted houses ' at @entity25 " this means they can sell for less , which makes the rental yields greater			1
the normal yields are between 3 - 4 % , but an apartment where there 's been a murder can get a yield of about 7 % , " he said			1
the apartment is then rented to someone who does not share the same set of beliefs -- normally a foreigner -- although some realtors say there are @entity30 clients who do n't care and one even identifies doctors and nurses ' who are used to working around the dead ' as potential tenants			0
" it often depends on the circumstances of the death and what stories and rumors are attached to it , " says @entity24			2
particularly gruesome murders or harrowing deaths can affect the market price of the whole floor of apartments ; in some cases , the entire building			1
" there was a bad murder in an apartment block in @entity71 in @entity0 , " he says			1
" a wife killed her husband , cut the body into pieces and placed the parts in dustbins on every floor			0
even 15 years later , apartments in that block are still difficult to sell			1
" for superstitious @entity82 , the building is hongza -- a term derived from the @entity86 word hong , meaning violence , murder or calamity , and za meaning residence			1
@entity92 houses can sometimes sell for as low as 40 % below the city average , although 15 - 20 % is more usual			1
@entity24 says his company recently opened up a section on its website called @entity97 in response to the growing market			2
" we were approached by agents who wanted to access this information more conveniently , " he says			0
the section , which details government data on unusual deaths and murders in apartment buildings across @entity0 since 1977 , makes for macabre reading			2
one typical entry for an apartment block in @entity111 reads : " 36 - year - old female secondary school teacher faced a marriage crisis , jumped off the building after sending a text message to her husband			0
" with all the details rendered in the sparse language of a police log entry , one could be forgiven for thinking that @entity0 life was a depressing litany of fatal misfortunes			2
however , realtors say an apartment is more or less hongza , depending on what happened there			0
" i have heard of realtors using this list which identifies places from one skull , which is like a fatal accident , to four skulls which is a high - profile murder , " says @entity24			0
" but i think it 's really an unofficial thing			0
" one realtor , who did not want to be identified , told @entity1 that hongza tends to wear off , as the apartment changes hands			0
" a subsequent owner will not attract as much bad luck as the first person who buys the flat after someone died there , " she says			0
" even so they can sometimes sell quickly -- i was just about to sell a hongza house to a client when another agent made a winning offer for a client			2
" my client must have missed it by all of half an hour			0
" despite their popularity among savvy bargain hunters , apartments where people have met violent or unusual ends are heavily stigmatised and banks will routinely run checks before lending on a hongza house , realtors say			1
agents are legally required in @entity0 to reveal to a buyer whether something has occurred on a property			2
" a @entity169 search will show what has happened in an apartment , " says @entity24			0
" if we do n't reveal that to a buyer they can take action against the agent			0
" for those with deep pockets , however , and without a willing foreigner to take up a lease , the investment strategy is simply to wait it out			0
" @entity186 heals all wounds , " notes @entity0 property speculator and blogger @entity184			2
" as time goes on , though , fewer and fewer people will remember what happened and the value will go up again			0

@entity0 people tend to shun houses where the *occupant* met a violent death
the apartments are known as " hongza " in @entity86 , meaning " calamity houses "
' " @entity92 " apartments can sell at a steep *discount* , sometimes as much as 40 %
buyers still trade in the apartments , which can show a strong yield on the rental market
