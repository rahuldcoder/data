-- @entity2 legend @entity1 once called soccer the " beautiful game " and at its best it showcases the very pinnacle of human endeavor as nations and communities are united in the common goal of supporting their teams and heroes			1
but on the flip side , some of the worst of aspects of human behavior are on show for all to see and then subjected to immense media scrutiny to highlight the fallibility of our sporting icons			0
so in celebration of the " dark side " @entity0 has compiled its @entity24 of soccer villains of the last decade			1
three of them , @entity26 , @entity28 and @entity29 , are worthy members of our nominated xi of soccer heroes , which just shows that triumph and disaster are twin imposters			1
see our first xi of soccer heroes			1
do you agree ? perhaps they can be excused because of the pressure of the modern game , while the rewards for victory or transferring to a rival club -- in @entity29 's case one of the great " betrayals " of all time -- are riches beyond ordinary fans ' dreams			1
here is the @entity53 select eleven of @entity55 soccer villains -- let @entity56 know what you think by adding your comment at the bottom of this page			1
@entity26 : @entity61 features at the very top of our football heroes of the decade but he also heads the list of villains for his infamous headbutt on @entity70 's @entity69 in extra time of the 2006 world cup final			1
it was his final match and after he was sent off @entity74 lost the penalty shootout			1
a sorry end to a glittering career at club and international level			0
@entity28 : @entity28 went into @entity74 's @entity81 qualifying playoff against @entity82 as one of the most respected footballers on the planet but by the end of the tie his reputation was in tatters			1
a deliberate handball set up the winning goal for @entity74 and sparked a worldwide debate on sporting ethics			0
@entity28 's reputation has been tainted and he can expect a less - than - warm reception at @entity96 2010			1
@entity97 : @entity98 midfielder @entity97 was the driving force of their 2002 @entity81 team with his much - admired cultured midfield play			0
@entity102 admired was his blatant dive to feign injury at a critical stage of a group match against @entity107			0
@entity108 was sent off as @entity98 won the match and eventually went on to lift the trophy			0
@entity97 's play acting was rightly condemned and forever replayed as the worst example of its kind			2
@entity29 : @entity115 international @entity29 was a hero with @entity117 's fanatical fans during his five years with the @entity119 giants , but when he defected to hated rivals @entity121 for a world record fee in 2000 their vitriol was unmatched			1
in a derby match two years later the severed head of a pig was even thrown onto the pitch in his direction			0
he was never forgiven and spent the final years of career with @entity129 in @entity130 5			2
@entity131 : @entity132 hardman @entity131 felled @entity133 of neighbors @entity134 in a 2001 derby in the final act of a feud dating back four years			2
the outspoken @entity139 , who even walked out on his country 's 2002 @entity81 bid , later admitted he had deliberately " hurt " @entity142 in revenge for an earlier incident			2
he received a lengthy ban but showed little remorse			0
@entity147 : star striker @entity147 was promptly sacked by @entity148 when he gave a positive test for cocaine and many thought that was the end of the matter			0
the @entity154 club promptly successfully sued the @entity156 international for breach of contract for a record $ 25 million			0
two legal appeals , with another in the pipeline , have so far failed , leaving @entity147 heavily out of pocket for a few moments of indiscretion			2
@entity165 : @entity166 referee @entity165 is another unworthy member of our hall of shame and rightly so after the former amateur player with @entity171 admitted to working in tandem with an international betting ring to fix games , including a @entity176 match involving @entity177			0
@entity165 was jailed for over two years and his revelations left a stain on @entity181 football			0
@entity182 : @entity183 's @entity182 appeared to have the world at his feet when he made an appearance for @entity187 , but there was a darker side to the combative midfielder with reports of fights with fellow players and even fans			1
it came to a head in january 2008 when @entity182 was jailed for six months for what the judge said was a " cowardly " assault in his native @entity200			0
@entity201 : @entity202 captain @entity201 has proved a popular performer in @entity205 fooball , but his contributions elsewhere are more questionable			0
he received a six - month ban from the @entity208 for spitting at a match official and during the 2006 @entity81 his tackle left @entity74 's @entity210 with a broken leg			1
@entity212 : the former @entity214 international goalkeeper became famous for his " @entity212 " clearance against @entity187 but in recent years he has cut a more controversial figure and was banned from @entity218 club football after testing positive for cocaine			2
he is good friends with the final member of our xi , @entity223			2
@entity223 : by the standards of the 90s , this was a quiet decade for the @entity228 soccer legend and the world held its collective breath as medical problems , almost certainly linked to his colorful past , caught up with him			1
now the @entity236 national coach , he took them to the @entity81 finals with a last - gasp qualification and then promptly spoilt it all by earning a temporary worldwide ban from @entity242 for abusing reporters after the crucial game .			0

@entity56 *reflects* on some of the most controversial and *unsavory* incidents of the last decade
the leading stars of the " beautiful game " have often let themselves down with moments of soccer madness
topping the list is @entity26 's infamous headbutt in the 2006 world cup final -- do you agree with our other selections ?
