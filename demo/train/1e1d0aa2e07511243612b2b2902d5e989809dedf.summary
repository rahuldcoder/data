while tensions remain high between the @entity2 and @entity3 , the relationship is more cordial between their scientists			1
scientists from both nations are collaborating via nongovernmental organizations and universities on projects ranging from tuberculosis research and deforestation issues to digital information technology			1
the idea behind science diplomacy is to build bridges and relationships through research and academics despite political tensions			1
this month , a delegation of @entity3 economic experts visited @entity22 to see various @entity2 businesses and academic institutions such as @entity25			1
it may seem like a bizarre concept that two countries , at odds with each other , would share scientific knowledge			0
but science diplomacy existed between the @entity33 and the @entity2 during the @entity34 , as researchers cooperated on nuclear issues , space missions and technology			1
and this practice continues , with @entity2 scientists working with academics and researchers from adversarial states like @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity3			1
" a group of us who believe in science diplomacy , believe that it is useful to find people in those countries with whom you can find something in common , with whom you can discuss and can perhaps cooperate in areas not strategic , military or defense - related , " said dr. @entity45 , senior adviser to the @entity46 , which is part of the @entity48 , an international non-profit organization dedicated to advancing science			1
@entity2 scientists , backed by a scientific engagement consortium that includes @entity48 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity48 , have worked with @entity3 scientists and technical universities since 2007 to deliver lectures and share resources and knowledge about subjects such as reforestation , river reclamation , soil quality and agriculture			1
the @entity2 government does not sponsor these activities			2
the visits are heavily supervised by @entity3 minders			2
also , scientists can not collaborate in areas related to weapons or the military			0
after a failed rocket launch last week , attention shifted to @entity3 's scientific capabilities			1
the launch drew nearly universal criticism , with @entity92 officials calling the country 's decision to launch " deplorable			0
" the failed launch also triggered concerns about a possible nuclear test			0
" the foreign powers are not the only ones with monopoly on military supremacy , and the days of their threatening and lying to us with atomic weapons is forever gone , " said @entity3 leader @entity98 , in the centennial celebration of his grandfather 's birth			2
under these circumstances , sharing scientific and technological knowledge with @entity3 may seem questionable			1
" given what has happened , those are legitimate concerns and questions , " said @entity111 , assistant professor at the @entity112 at the @entity113 , whose main area of focus is public diplomacy			0
" the level of exchanges between the @entity2 and @entity3 is quite limited when it comes to science engagement , " she added			1
" given what scientists can bring to @entity3 , there are a lot of limitations			1
so i do n't think that those exchanges can really be blamed for helping @entity3			2
" despite the rocket controversy , @entity111 supports continued efforts in science diplomacy			1
she added that people should distinguish between @entity3 and its government			2
the intent behind scientific overtures is well - meaning , said @entity138 , a @entity139 - based human rights activist for @entity3			1
" looking at it from bigger picture , one - on - one contact is good , because it exposes @entity3 to individuals and provides an opportunity to meet and talk with @entity2 , " he said			1
" but this is all done between the watchful eyes of the minders			0
when these meetings take place , the end result is , everything goes to help the regime			0
it does n't help the people that really need help			0
" @entity2 and @entity158 scientists , including a @entity160 laureate , an astronaut and other elite scientists , have visited @entity3 in recent years and discussed ecology , biology , global weather systems and the @entity167 scientific method , such as the peer review process			1
" to simply oppose and coerce the @entity3 without trying to engage them is a prescription for failure , " wrote @entity169 , the only @entity2 astronaut to visit @entity3 , in an opinion piece for the @entity171 after his visit			1
" we can engage without appeasing			0
" @entity169 visited the elite @entity177 in the nation 's capital			0
the lessons are taught in @entity181 , and the school educates students in the modern sciences			0
select groups of @entity3 have visited the @entity2			1
one group visited @entity188 's headquarters in april , according to the @entity3 media site @entity190			2
@entity188 did not respond to inquiries about the meeting			0
the same group of 12 @entity3 officials also visited @entity25 on april 1 , where they learned about the history of @entity22 and discussed economic collaboration			2
researchers from @entity25 and @entity3 's @entity199 teamed up in 2008 to develop a way to detect drug - resistant tuberculosis			2
@entity3 is believed to have one of the highest incidences of tuberculosis outside @entity204			2
this kind of project has mutual benefits			0
" re-emerging infectious diseases do n't respect boundaries , " said @entity208 , the chief international officer and director of the @entity210 at @entity48			0
he referred to cooperation with @entity215 and @entity2 scientists in 2010			1
before the political relationship between @entity215 ( also known as @entity215 ) and the @entity2 began to thaw , scientists from both countries were addressing ways to tackle malaria and other infectious diseases			1
for 10 years , @entity67 has worked with @entity222 in @entity3 to develop a digital information library so they would no longer have to rely on card catalogs			1
the data would be stored online			0
the program brings @entity3 computer scientists to the @entity229 campus , as the only academic exchange program between @entity2 and @entity3 universities			1
" during these difficult times , it 's more important to have channels of communication that are not necessarily hostile , " said @entity232 , who directs @entity67 's integrated information technology research collaboration with @entity222			2
" countries are adversarial to the @entity2 , but open to science , " he said			1
" they like our science , our technology			0
this opens doors to places where our elected officials are not welcome			0
" @entity138 , the human rights activist who works with @entity3 defectors , remains doubtful that this has much impact on ordinary citizens			0
" when i talk to defectors , they do n't believe that these scientific exchanges will help the people			0
this will only help the regime			0
" in march , the @entity48 launched a new quarterly journal called @entity259 , which examines the relationship between science and diplomacy			2
an editorial published in its first issue recalled instances when the @entity2 collaborated with its historic rivals such as @entity267 , @entity268 and the @entity33			0
" @entity2 scientists and @entity271 scientists who had built nuclear weapons , built enough to destroy civilization , " @entity45 said			2
" it would 've completely destroyed both countries			0
but they began talking with each other , and gradually , they built an atmosphere of trust that influenced government policies			0
it did n't suddenly topple the walls , but there was a basis of communication			0

no diplomatic relationship exists between the @entity2 and @entity3 , but scientists interact
science diplomacy aims to build bridges and relationships using research and academics
after rocket launch , sharing scientific information with @entity3 may seem questionable
