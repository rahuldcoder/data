-- while this year 's @entity3 commercials ran the gamut from sentimental to silly , some were downright offensive to viewers who used the @entity8 hashtag # @entity6 to flag what they considered the most sexist spots of the night			1
web host @entity12 earned more than 7,500 # @entity15 tweets for its ad featuring an intimate smooch between supermodel @entity18 and a bespectacled computer programmer , putting it at the top of the list of offenders , according to @entity23 , the social activism nonprofit leading the @entity8 campaign for the second year			1
the " @entity25 " and its " smart meets sexy " tagline drew criticism from men and women for " stereotyping programmers and objectifying women " in the words of one male @entity8 user			1
" @ @entity12 , continuing the tired stereotype that programmers are geeks , while women are sex objects			1
disgusting , " a female user tweeted			0
overall , # @entity15 generated more than 10,000 tweets and reached more than 8 million people on @entity8 during sunday 's @entity43 - 49ers showdown , a spokesman for @entity23 said , citing statistics from @entity45 and @entity46			1
two days after the @entity3 , the ads continue to generate conversation and controversy			1
" @entity58 ' em or hate ' em , you have to admit @entity12 's @entity3 ads are effective , " begins one story published tuesday on news that the domain name provider had its biggest sales day in history after its @entity3 campaign			1
' @entity60 made a farmer ' ad stirs pride , passion in agriculture others continued to criticize some of sunday night 's ads for playing on typical gender stereotypes , promoting sexual assault and making the @entity3 into a less than family - friendly event			1
" the # superbowl commercials are a window into @entity74 culture & values			2
today , try to pay attention to what ( they 're ) telling you , " one user said in a comment that was retweeted more than 230 times			0
in response , another person tweeted : " ( let 's ) just enjoy the game			2
@entity88 :-) :-) " in a statement monday , @entity12 said it embraced " commercial controversy " even if some viewers deemed the content " inappropriate			1
" @entity94 rejected two " edgier " versions of the spot , and the final version earned more than 4 million views on @entity99 before the game even started , the company said			0
" we 're not going to apologize for ' the kiss , ' " ceo @entity101 said			0
" it 's sparking conversations			2
it was approved by network standards and practices and it uses humor to illustrate the point about how powerful a combination ' sexy ' and ' smart ' are			0
personally , i think it 's hilarious			2
" @entity12 was n't the only company to earn the @entity6 designation			2
the main goal of the campaign is to make consumers think twice about their purchasing power , said @entity119 , social media coordinator of @entity120			1
but , as the response to the @entity12 spot showed , the campaign not only highlights demeaning portrayals of women but also the limited depiction of manhood on display in most @entity3 commercials , he said			1
breaking down @entity3 tech ads " masculinity in @entity74 is so very narrowly defined , and it 's an interesting juxtaposition to have that conversation during the @entity3 , " @entity119 said			1
viewers have come to expect women seductively devouring fast food or throwing themselves at men during @entity3 commercials , he said			1
but more surprising was the reaction to ads featuring what @entity119 called more " subtle " forms of sexism , such as @entity145 's " prom " ad , which showed a teen boy strutting onto the dance floor , grabbing a girl and pulling her in for a kiss			1
" ( @entity152 ) top teaching our boys that bravery is kissing a girl you 've never talked to & that girls are simply objects or rewards , " one person tweeted			2
a spokesman for @entity145 said the prom queen 's reaction to the kiss was meant to indicate there was history between the two , showing that " in no way was the kiss something less than mutual			0
" " while trying to tell a complete story within the 60 - second format , much of the backstory has to be implied or set up off - camera , " the spokesman said in an e-mail			0
after the kiss , another prom - goer , presumably the girl 's date , lunges at the guy and punches him in the face			0
change scene to the protagonist driving away in his @entity145 with a bruised eye			0
" so getting punched in the face makes someone a man ? " another person tweeted			0
@entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 were also targeted for ads playing the " nice car = get the girls " trope , in the words of one person			0
" hey @ @entity197 more women drive than men and we influence 85 % of car buying decisions			0
stop the sexist ads , " @ @entity202 said			0
the lesson of the evening ? as one person put it : " what have i learned from # superbowl ads ? women = robots , objects , strippers & showgirls			2
hmm what else ? ? ? " @entity23 compiled its favorite tweets and viewpoints into a @entity218 summarizing reaction			0
