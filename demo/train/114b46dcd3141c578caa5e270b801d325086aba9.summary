@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 won a @entity4 for the @entity1 bank he founded but now he finds himself in a bitter fight to retain his job			1
@entity3 pioneered microcredit financing and founded @entity9 nearly three decades ago in an effort to alleviate poverty by lending to the poor			1
he refused wednesday to bow to government demands and resign from the bank that won him a @entity15 in 2006			1
" we established @entity9 through a special ordinance , with rules that are specific , according to which my current term as managing director is fully valid , " he said			2
" @entity22 has three representatives on the board and they have unanimously approved these rules			0
" @entity9 caught the world 's attention by specializing in providing loans to low - income entrepreneurs who were unable to secure money through regular banks			2
@entity3 quickly gained a reputation as a " banker to the poor			2
" @entity1 finance minister @entity36 said @entity3 was too old to run the bank and should step down			1
" normally the retirement age of a bank 's managing director in @entity1 is 65 , and professor @entity3 is now 70 , " @entity36 said			1
the pressure stems from allegations in a television documentary that @entity3 illegally diverted @entity9 money			1
@entity9 denied the charges and @entity46 , a key bank donor , found no evidence of wrongdoing			2
but the larger debate has been over the notion of microcredit itself			0
its critics have charged that lenders were making big money off small loans			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity58 minced no words when she compared @entity9 's operations to " sucking the blood from the poor in the name of alleviating poverty			1
" " it is a question of explaining to her , " @entity3 told @entity2 in a recent interview			2
" she probably has no close connection to that , all the good things that microcredit has done globally , not just in @entity1			1
" @entity3 has admitted serious problems that have surfaced recently in the world of microfinancing			2
poor families have complained about debt burdens and loan sharks who charge an exorbitant interest			0
@entity3 conceded some lenders have taken advantage of the system			0
but , he insisted to @entity2 , that a few bad apples should not undermine the idea of microcredit			0
" the idea will not disappear , " he said			0
" it is a question of teething problems			0
it is a question of misuse and abuse of the idea			0
" @entity36 said the push for @entity3 ' resignation had no link to politics , but many analysts say @entity3 is still under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party four years ago during an interim , unelected military - backed government			1
that party was later abandoned			0
@entity3 faces a defamation charge for comments he made four years ago to the @entity107 news agency that politicians were only in " power to make money			1
" several prominent figures have stepped up in @entity3 ' defense , including @entity113 , the former @entity115 president and @entity117 @entity116 , who chairs a newly formed " @entity119 " initiative			0
" one of the priorities is also to support the independence of @entity9 and its founder @entity125 , who together were awarded the @entity4 in 2006 , as they have been the target of an ongoing pressure campaign of rumors and misleading information , " the group said in a statement			1
@entity2 's @entity130 and @entity131 and journalist @entity132 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity1 government wants @entity3 to resign
but the microcredit pioneer and @entity9 founder says he will not step down
*tensions* exist between the government and @entity3 for politrical comments
