-- i served in the armed forces for 25 years , but until january 8 , 2011 , i did n't think about guns or gun violence that much			1
i had other things to think about -- my children , traveling between @entity7 and @entity8 and @entity9 to see my wife , rep. @entity10 , and of course , flying the space shuttle			2
like lots of people , every time there was a mass shooting , with lots of news coverage , i watched , but i was n't aware of the statistics and of how gun violence permeates our country			1
then @entity22 was shot and six of her constituents were murdered during a " @entity25 on your corner " event in @entity8 , @entity27			2
during her long and ongoing recovery , i started paying a lot more attention			2
i 'm a numbers guy , a statistics guy -- and what i 've learned has shocked me			2
almost 100 people a day die from a gun , 33 are murdered			1
we 've got 20 times the murder rate of similar countries			0
i 've watched the globe spin past below me from the window of the space shuttle			0
and so my perspective has changed			0
i see this epidemic of gun violence as a crisis , because i know that every statistic is a citizen --- someone like my wife , or @entity52 's mom , @entity53 , who says simply about her daughter , murdered senselessly in @entity55 , " a piece of my heart is gone			1
" and , excuse the reference , it does n't take a rocket scientist to realize that while this issue is complicated , there are things we can do -- now , together -- that will reduce violence			1
right now , we have two systems			0
some people , like me , when we buy a gun , we go through a background check			1
it takes about five minutes -- trust me , i 'm not known to be a patient guy , and it did n't take more than a few minutes when i bought a rifle this past november			0
ninety - one percent of background checks are completed instantaneously , and they do n't lead to a government database			1
i passed my background check and got my gun , and since 1994 , more than 2 million folks -- among them , criminals and dangerously mentally ill people -- failed their background checks			1
but we do n't know which of those millions just got in their car and drove to a gun show , or home to their computer to go on the @entity93 -- both places where anyone can buy a gun without a background check			1
that does n't make sense			1
it 's like saying , hey , criminals , to board the plane , either go through a metal detector and be checked against the terrorist watch list , or , if you prefer , walk right down that red carpet and take a seat , no search necessary			0
which would you choose ? that 's why @entity22 and i are so determined to get a universal background check in place			2
it 's simple , it 's not a @entity115 or a @entity117 issue , and it closes a clear loophole that puts our kids and our communities at risk , and it does it in a way that respects the @entity128 rights of people like me			0
we are n't naive in thinking that expanded background checks will solve all our problems overnight , but they are a great first step that even gun owners support			1
so , i 'm putting everything i learned from my time in the @entity136 and at @entity137 -- 375 aircraft carrier landings , 39 combat missions and more than 50 days in space -- to working with @entity22 and @entity142 ' more than 100,000 members to get this done			0
when you 're at the controls of a plane or the space shuttle , you rely on data			0
you analyze it methodically ; you evaluate it objectively			0
the data around background checks is clear : up to 40 % of gun transfers are made without background checks , and a national survey of inmates found that nearly 80 % of those who used a handgun in a crime acquired it without a background check			1
that tells me that criminals are getting guns , because we 're making it too easy			2
and 82 % of @entity168 gun owners -- including more than 70 % of @entity170 members -- support criminal background checks for all gun sales			1
ninety - two percent of all households in the country support universal background checks			1
that tells me that citizens across the country want @entity25 to get this done , because they know it will keep us safer			0
that 's a clear path , right there			0
we can get there if we all raise our voices			0
talk to your neighbors , your co-workers , the parents at your kids ' basketball game			0
talk to your elected representative			0
tell them you want one system , a universal background check that will keep all of us safer and respects our @entity128 rights			2
@entity22 and me at @entity194			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			1

@entity197 : gun violence in the @entity168 is out of control
he says 2 million @entity168 have failed gun background checks
those who failed can buy guns at a gun show or *online* ; that makes no sense , he says
@entity197 : *majority* of @entity168 and gun owners support background checks for all
