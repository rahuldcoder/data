-- @entity2 historian @entity1 recently uncovered the first copy of an unredacted " anonymous " @entity5 letter sent to @entity6 telling him to kill himself			1
click here to see the blacked out version of the @entity5 threat letter there are dozens of such menacing memos and letters held in the @entity14 archives that detail the @entity5 's systematic plot to " neutralize " the civil rights leader			1
in retrospect it may be horrifying to know that the government had such a plan , but historians say the plot did have an upside			0
@entity5 wiretaps have " given us the most powerful and persuasive source of all for seeing how utterly selfless @entity6 was , " as a civil rights leader , according to a leading civil rights scholar			1
" you see him being intensely self - critical			0
@entity6 really and truly believed that he was there to be of service to others			2
this was not a man with any egomaniacal joy of being a famous person , or being a leader , " said @entity35 - winning scholar @entity34 in a recent interview with @entity0			0
hoping to prove the rev. @entity6 was under the influence of @entity43 , the @entity5 kept the civil rights leader under constant surveillance			1
see the @entity5 's actual discussion about the surveillance @entity49 's order for the surveillance see where the @entity5 put the microphones the agency 's hidden tape recorders turned up almost nothing about communism			1
but they did reveal embarrassing details about @entity6 's sex life -- details the @entity5 was able to use against him			1
the almost fanatical zeal with which the @entity5 pursued @entity6 is disclosed in tens of thousands of @entity5 memos from the 1960s			1
see the actual @entity5 document calling @entity6 an " unprincipled opportunistic individual " the @entity5 paper trail spells out in detail the government agency 's concerted efforts to derail @entity6 's efforts on behalf of the civil rights movement			1
the @entity5 's interest in @entity6 intensified after the @entity72 in august 1963 , when @entity6 delivered his " @entity73 , " which many historians consider the most important speech of the 20th century			1
after the speech , an @entity5 memo called @entity6 the " most dangerous and effective @entity79 leader in the country			1
" the bureau convened a meeting of department heads to " explore how best to carry on our investigation [ of @entity6 ] to produce the desired results without embarrassment to the @entity87 , " which included " a complete analysis of the avenues of approach aimed at neutralizing @entity6 as an effective @entity79 leader			1
" see the memo ordering the @entity5 to follow @entity6 throughout the country the @entity5 began secretly tracking @entity6 's flights and watching his associates			1
in july 1963 , a month before the march on @entity95 , fbi director @entity49 filed a request with attorney general @entity97 to tap @entity6 's and his associates ' phones and to bug their homes and offices			1
in september , @entity97 consented to the technical surveillance			0
@entity97 gave the @entity5 permission to break into @entity6 's office and home to install the bugs , as long as agents recognized the " delicacy of this particular matter " and did n't get caught installing them			1
@entity97 added a proviso -- he wanted to be personally informed of any pertinent information			0
while @entity6 did have associates who had been members of the @entity113 , by all accounts they severed those ties when they started working in the civil rights movement			1
what 's more , the @entity5 bugs never picked up evidence that @entity6 himself was a communist , or was interested in toeing the party line			2
but the long list of bugs in his hotel rooms picked up just enough about @entity6 's love life			2
see the @entity5 memo that calls him " unfit to serve as a minister of the gospel " see the @entity5 file cover about @entity6 's love life a decision in a 1977 court case brought by @entity134 , one of @entity6 's associates , sealed the transcripts from those wiretaps until 2027			1
but @entity6 's associates confirm there were at least two cases in which @entity5 surveillance caught @entity6 in compromising circumstances			1
the first incident involved @entity6 at a party at the @entity144 in @entity95			0
the @entity5 recorded the party and captured the sounds of a sexual encounter in the room afterwards			0
the second incident occurred during @entity6 's stay in a hotel in @entity151 , @entity152			2
there , agents heard another drunken gathering in which @entity6 told an off - color joke about the recently assassinated president @entity156			0
@entity49 sent transcripts and excerpts of those recordings to the @entity160 and to the attorney general			0
@entity49 's contempt for @entity6 's private behavior is clear in the memos he kept in his personal files			1
his scrawl across the bottom of positive news stories about @entity6 's success dripped with loathing			2
on a story about @entity6 receiving the @entity173 peace medal from the @entity174 , he wrote " this is disgusting			0
" on the story " @entity6 , @entity177 to talk on @entity178 , " he scribbled " astounding			0
" on a story about @entity6 's meeting with the pope , " i am amazed that the @entity177 gave an audience to such a degenerate			2
" on a story about @entity6 being the heavy favorite to win the @entity186 , he wrote " @entity6 could well qualify for the ' top alley cat ' prize ! " see @entity49 's thoughts on @entity6 's success , in his own handwriting see @entity49 's thoughts about @entity6 's interaction with the @entity177 , in his own handwriting when @entity6 learned he would be the recipient of the @entity193 in 1964 , the @entity5 decided to take its harassment of @entity6 one step further , sending him an insulting and threatening note anonymously			1
a draft was found in the @entity5 files years later			0
in it the @entity5 wrote , " you are a colossal fraud and an evil , vicious one at that			0
" the letter went on to say , " the @entity14 public ... will know you for what you are -- an evil , abnormal beast , " and " @entity208 could not do more			2
" the letter 's threat was ominous , if not specific : " @entity6 you are done			2
" some have theorized the intent of the letter was to drive @entity6 to commit suicide in order to avoid personal embarrassment			0
" @entity6 , there is only one thing left for you to do , " the letter concluded			0
" you know what it is ... you better take it before your filthy , abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation			0
" with the exception of the wiretap transcripts that remain sealed under court order , many of the other memos were made public as part of high - profile congressional investigations into the @entity5 's harassment of @entity6			1
a summary was put together during the course of these investigations			0
other memos were released through a @entity241 request from the @entity242 in 1978			0
another large batch was released through a 1979 @entity241 request from @entity34			0
while the memos depict a cold and calculating attempt by the government to personally embarrass @entity6 , the memos also create an ironic byproduct , according to @entity34			2
" when you have a wiretap on someone you pick up all sorts of dreck			0
but in terms of the political history that ironically the @entity5 has created for us , it 's a wonderful resource , " @entity34 said .			2

@entity5 memo called @entity6 the " most dangerous ... effective @entity79 leader " in @entity14
hidden wiretaps turned up no @entity113 ties , just *extramarital* affairs
@entity49 's contempt for @entity6 's private behavior shows in private memos
