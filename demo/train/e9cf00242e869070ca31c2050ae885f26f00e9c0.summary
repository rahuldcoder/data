-- defending champions @entity1 will play @entity3 in the @entity5 final after thrashing bitter rivals @entity7 4 - 0 in a semifinal that saw their opponents finish with just eight men			1
the game was evenly poised until @entity13 brought down @entity14 in the area eight minutes before the break			0
@entity13 was sent off and @entity17 converted the spot - kick to put @entity1 on their way for a possible third successive title			1
@entity22 added a classy second after 65 minutes before @entity24 then saw red for a horror challenge on @entity26 five minutes later			0
@entity27 grabbed his first goal for @entity1 nine minutes from the end , but there was still time for @entity7 goalkeeper @entity31 to pick up a second yellow card -- and for @entity33 to make it 4 - 0 in stoppage time			1
the result proved sweet revenge for @entity1 who missed out on a @entity40 spot when they were beaten by @entity7 in a play - off			1
there was controversy surrounding @entity1 's opener			2
the penalty decision appeared clear - cut but @entity17 converted with the help of a stuttering run - up which incensed @entity31 , who made a vehement protest to the referee and was lucky not to be sent off himself			2
@entity22 doubled the advantage after turning @entity24 inside out before dispatching a left - footed shot into the far corner			0
@entity24 's evening got worse after he launched a two - footed lunge on @entity26 and was rightly given his marching orders			0
@entity27 came off the bench to add a third with a neat finish from an acute angle			0
@entity31 was then dismissed two minutes from time as he swung his foot at @entity61 , who moments later finished past substitute keeper @entity63 for the fourth			0
meanwhile , earlier in the day , @entity3 edged past near - neighbors @entity65 1 - 0 in a match which produced much less drama			1
@entity68 scored the only goal midway through the first half when a @entity72 corner caught out the napping @entity65 defence and the @entity75 striker applied the finishing touch			2
it was one - way traffic thereafter as wasteful finishing from @entity65 , coupled with some dogged defending and solid goalkeeping from @entity79 , helped the four - time former winners seal a place in the final for the first time since 1992 .			1
