-- september 15 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : hi ! i 'm @entity18 , this is @entity0 , and if you do n't know why a hurricane 's winds turn in a certain direction , you are going to by the end of today 's show			1
first up : back to @entity25 @entity26 : first up , though , president @entity27 gives a speech for a very specific group of @entity30 : you ! he talked directly to students in his second back - to - school address			1
he gave the speech yesterday at the @entity25 in @entity4 , @entity5 , and the president offered some suggestions that might sound familiar to you : do your homework , pay attention in class , show up on time			1
his main point was about the importance of education and to urge students to get the most out of their opportunities in school			1
@entity48 was in @entity4 for yesterday 's speech			1
she has more on it for us right now			2
suzanne ? ( begin video ) @entity53 , @entity0 @entity54 : hey , @entity18			2
well , president @entity27 picked @entity25 , one of the best schools here in @entity4 , as the place to give his speech , his back - to - school speech for all the students around the country			1
obviously , a lot of it was very encouraging , optimistic , encouraging students to pursue their education , that they are in control of their own destiny			1
the president also got personal , as well			1
we heard him talk about his own struggle with his identity when he was younger , being a product of a white mother and a black father , a father who was largely absent in his life			2
the president also talked about the fact that he was n't always a good student ; that he needed a little prodding from his own mother from time to time			1
and then , what was interesting , @entity18 , as well , the president talked about what it was like for young people and young students in the times , these hard economic times , and the mood of the country			1
here 's how the president related the two			1
@entity30 president @entity27 : i know a lot of you are also feeling the strain of some difficult times			1
you know what 's going on in the news and you also know what 's going on in some of your own families			1
you 've read about the war in @entity104			2
you hear about the recession that we 've been through , and sometimes maybe you 're seeing the worries in your parents ' faces or sense it in their voice			1
( @entity112 ) retail sales are up @entity26 : all right , well , for many @entity30 , back to school means back - to - school shopping			1
you 've probably gotten most of yours done already			2
and experts think that is why retail sales were up last month			2
around $ 363 billion in sales during the month of august			2
that is up .4 percent from july , and it 's up 3.6 percent from last august			1
could be a good sign for the economy			2
back - to - school spending can give an idea of how holiday spending might go			1
but some analysts are saying do n't jump the gun just yet			2
they point out that while spending is up a little bit , people are still holding back because of concerns about -- you guessed it -- the economy			2
@entity137 @entity138 , @entity16 : time for the shoutout ! what determines which way hurricanes rotate ? if you think you know it , then shout it out ! is it the : a ) @entity149 , b ) @entity151 , c ) @entity153 or @entity154 ) @entity148 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity153 has to do with the earth 's rotation ; it deflects winds in certain directions in different hemispheres			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity162 @entity26 : this image you see over my shoulder is one of the scarier images we 've had on @entity0			1
it 's @entity162 , what the thing looks like from space			1
that opening in the middle there is the eye of the storm			2
and you see how the winds are turning counter-clockwise here around the eye ? that 's because of the @entity153			1
they 're from a satellite called the @entity186 - 15			1
they give you an idea of just how big this storm is			2
it started out as a tropical storm on saturday			2
yesterday afternoon , it was a category 4 hurricane			1
so it 's not only big , it got big fast			1
forecasters think it will stay out in the ocean			1
but because the thing is so massive , @entity162 could cause some severe conditions for parts of the @entity203			0
@entity204 @entity26 : remember that fire we told you about on monday that came from a gas line in @entity6 , @entity7 ? the gas company , @entity209 , says it 'll pay up to $ 100 million to help the people who lost their homes			0
the company 's president said he knows that money ca n't return lives or restore memories , but that he 's committed to helping rebuild			1
now , we want you to check out this surveillance video			0
this was taken on the day of the fire at a store about a quarter mile away			0
at first , people just stop what they 're doing			0
then , they start running for the exits			0
and you can actually see -- take a look at this -- you can see the doors being blown in by the force of the explosion when the fire started			0
@entity233 in @entity8 @entity26 : in @entity8 , there 's a new law that 'll go into effect next @entity237			1
the parliament approved it by a wide margin in july			0
the @entity8 @entity241 passed it yesterday 246 - 1 , with 100 politicians choosing not to vote			1
the @entity8 people are in favor of the new law by four to one			0
what is this ? it 's a ban			1
that 's what you see here , those full body coverings that some @entity251 women wear			1
actually , this new law bans any veil that covers your face			0
the lawmakers say those veils , including the burqas , deny equality			0
a @entity8 council that offers advice on laws says this ban might be unconstitutional			0
is this legit ? @entity268 , @entity16 : is this legit ? @entity269 starts on the first of october			0
not legit ! it actually starts on september 15 and runs through october 15			0
@entity269 @entity26 : now , you might be wondering why @entity269 starts in the middle of a month			0
it 's because the celebration started out as @entity276			1
it was established by former president @entity278 in 1968			1
the week always included september 15th , because seven @entity280 countries celebrate their independence around that time : @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 and @entity289			0
in 1988 , the week was expanded into @entity269 , starting on september 15th and ending on october 15th			0
it 's a time to celebrate the culture and traditions of @entity30 from @entity294 - speaking countries and to honor their contributions to @entity280 society			1
free teacher materials @entity26 : our @entity298 turns 223 years old on friday , but it still applies to our lives			0
and our @entity301 challenges students to find examples of how			1
the activity is free , and it 's up in the @entity306 section of our website			1
you know where to find it ; it 's your favorite address on the web : @entity315			1
@entity316 @entity26 : we 're gon na talk about science fiction for a minute now			0
@entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 : all these are about life on other planets			0
well , scientists say they 've discovered new species right here on @entity328			1
these things are out in the ocean , down in deep areas that , until now , had never been explored			1
she talks about what 's been found down in the deep			1
( begin video ) @entity336 , conservationist and author of " @entity338 " : the inspiration behind the book " @entity338 " that i wrote is really clear , because it happened one day , and that was when i visited the @entity343 in @entity7 which , to my standards , is the most beautiful aquarium in the world			0
my life just completely changed afterwards			0
i flew back and all i could see were images of these creatures in my mind , and i just wanted to go home and tell everyone , tell the whole world ! i felt like we had been looking for alien life on other planets for so long , and i felt we were wrong			0
alien life is exactly here			0
it 's on this planet			1
it 's just in the deep ocean			1
so , i felt i needed to share my excitement and wonder			0
i must say i 've got a soft point for invertebrates			0
so , animals without a back bone			0
you know , deep sea fin octopus , those that we call dumbo octopuses			0
and they are pink or orangey , and they 've got big fins , but they look like big ears , so that 's why we call them dumbos			2
so , when you go down with the submersible , you go down through the water column			0
and if you turn your lights off , you disturb all these animals , right , and so they all emit light			0
so , you look through the portal and it 's much better than watching the sky , because there 's so much going on			2
it 's not static at all			2
some light is just very , very instantaneous , sort of clicks or flashes			0
and others is continuous , sort of strings of light that disappear in the distance			0
it 's just spectacular , spectacular			2
( @entity112 ) before we go @entity26 : spectacular indeed			0
before we go , a tale of another interesting creature			0
this one is a baby squirrel			0
the only thing that could make this any cuter is if it were next to a kitten			0
we did not set this up			0
the two are siblings , sort of			0
the kitten 's mom adopted the squirrel when it fell out of its nest			2
now , it 's being raised like a cat ! the squirrel seems happy to go along			2
it 's even started purring			2
goodbye @entity26 : not getting at all squirrelly about the idea of having a cat family			0
in fact , they sound like a purrfect family			0
and that will be all the time we have for meow			0
hope you have a great day			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity18 .			0
