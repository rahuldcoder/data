-- all eyes were on the opposition candidate as word of the election results spread			1
after tireless campaigning and vows of victory , what would he say to throngs of fired - up supporters ? would he snap , after months of keeping his cool as @entity14 president @entity13 sprinkled speeches with insults aimed at him ? on the night after the election , @entity17 was quick to concede after official results revealed he had lost by more than 10 percentage points			1
new @entity14 vp seen as possible successor to @entity13 " to know how to win , you also must know how to lose , " @entity17 said			1
" the word of the people is sacred			0
" his words , analysts say , reveal a strategy that could play a key role in how @entity14 's opposition evolves			1
" it was very magnanimous and , i think , very constructive , " said @entity31 , president of the @entity32			0
" i think that 's a real model for @entity14 and for other countries			1
" after any vote , the way the losing candidate responds can have an impact far beyond @entity41 , said @entity42 , a lecturer on leadership at @entity45 's @entity44			1
" this is much more about the future than it is about the present , " she said			2

he called him a " little yankee " and assailed him as a member of the bourgeoisie			0
" he never acknowledged his name , just talked about the rich kid , and taunted him , as @entity13 tends to do , " @entity31 said			0
but there was n't the rhetorical back and forth , the tit for tat			0
" from the outset , @entity17 said he wanted to take a different tone			1
" they insult me , hey , i am not going to respond with an insult			0
the country is not waiting for my insults			0
the country expects my commitment , " he said in a february interview with the @entity77 network			0
" the country expects me to offer them a future			2
" going head to head with @entity13 was a tactic opposition politicians had unsuccessfully tried in the past , @entity31 said			0
@entity13 slams @entity14 opposition after election victory " he 's such a master at it			1
if you start to criticize him , then he 'll come back with more , " @entity31 said			0
" he 's demonstrated over 14 years that he plays this game better than anybody ... ( and ) he emerges stronger than ever			2
" @entity13 still triumphed in sunday 's vote , @entity31 said , but @entity17 -- with more than 45 % of votes -- came closer than any past presidential election opponent has come to defeating @entity13			1
" it obviously resonated with over 6 million @entity14 , " @entity31 said			1
the opposition candidate was quick to reassure his supporters and stressed that he did not believe there was fraud at the polls			2
he compared the election to the way diehard fans feel when @entity14 's national soccer team loses			1
they are devastated , he said , but they do n't stop going to the stadium			0

i got up , as i am sure the great majority of @entity14 got up today			1
you have to learn from every process			0
you have to reflect always on every contest , " he said tuesday			0

in @entity157 , they staged sit - ins and blockades			0
memories of the upheaval stuck with many @entity150			0
this year , when @entity146 was once again a candidate , it did n't play well at the polls , @entity31 said			2
" it did n't really help his image very much nationally			0
i think he may have done a lot better this time			0
i do n't know whether he would have won , " @entity31 said , " but i think people remembered the way he acted in 2006 , and that was a real liability for him			0
" this year , election officials have repeatedly ruled that @entity175 won july 's presidential vote			1
looking toward the future that 's not the norm , @entity42 said			1
" the democratic tradition is to concede defeat graciously , so that whatever your future ... you are seen as a grown - up person who can accept this in the gracious spirit of an adult democracy , " she said			2
in the @entity190 , for example , candidates often bounce back after an election loss , she said			2
" we have a real tradition of people who 've been defeated once coming back to win the next time over , " she said , noting that @entity17 could have a similar comeback in mind			1
@entity42 , who analyzes global leadership trends on her blog , " @entity203 , " described @entity13 as a " bully " and said a nation 's people tire of such tactics over time			2

" @entity31 said @entity17 ' post-election comments struck a " perfect pitch			1
" @entity14 's political landscape will inevitably change at some point , he said			1
" @entity13 is not going to last forever , and the concern is always that given the tremendous polarization in the country , and tremendous rancor , there 's always the potential you ca n't rule out for some instability and some violence , " he said			2
" the discourse that @entity17 used during the campaign , but especially after he lost , is very helpful to reduce those tensions and to point to a path of reconciliation , which is what the country will need to heal			1
" even with the election results in , political uncertainty remains in @entity14 , with questions about @entity13 's health lingering			1
over the past year , the 58 - year - old leader has been visibly weakened by cancer surgeries and treatment			0
he has kept secret the kind of cancer he has and his prognosis			0
in may , speculation intensified over who would succeed @entity13 when he named 10 people to the highest circle of his advisers			0
but in july , he said he was cancer free			0
since sunday 's vote , he has pledged to push forward with his socialist reforms in his next six - year term and " be a better president every day			0
