@entity1 poll : majority dissatisfied but do n't think administration misled on @entity16 attack " i know that @entity3 was unable to be able to testify tomorrow in an open setting , " sen. @entity83 , @entity84 , told reporters wednesday			1
" i do think it 's imperative for all concerned that she testify in an open session prior to any changing of the regime			0
i think that that 's very important for her , i think it 's very important for our country , and i think it 's very important to really understand sort of the inner workings of the @entity20 itself			2
" @entity3 to testify before @entity102 panel in january however late wednesday , @entity102 foreign affairs chairwoman @entity103 , @entity105 , indicated that @entity3 will indeed testify in front of the committee sometime in mid-january			1
@entity103 issued a statement saying , " we still do n't have information from the @entity77 administration on what went so tragically wrong in @entity16 that resulted in the deaths of four patriotic @entity15			2
we have been combing through classified and unclassified documents and have tough questions about @entity20 threat assessments and decision - making on @entity16			1
this requires a public appearance by the @entity120 herself			0
other cabinet secretaries involved should also be held publicly accountable			0
" lawmakers are right to demand answers of @entity3 , said @entity125 , editor of @entity126			2
" @entity3 must take her fair share of responsibility for the mismanagement that led to the @entity16 disaster			1
and i believe she has			0
her response to it , the appointment of a serious review effort led by ( ambassador @entity134 and ( adm. @entity135 , its swift , thorough and unflinching completion of its duties and her acceptance of all its recommendations has been a textbook case of how to handle a crisis responsibly , " @entity125 said			0
sizing up @entity146 as secretary of state it is a crisis that has left an indelible mark on the careers of several high profile @entity77 administration officials			1
@entity152 attacked for @entity16 comments @entity155 ambassador @entity154 withdrew her name from consideration to become the top @entity15 diplomat after drawing heavy criticism from @entity161 sen. @entity160 and other @entity73 over her public statements about the @entity16 attacks			2
in a letter to @entity77 , @entity152 said the @entity60 " confirmation process would be lengthy , disruptive , and costly â € ” to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities			0
that trade off is simply not worth it to our country			0
" @entity3 praised @entity152 as a capable leader and insisted " she made very clear in her appearances that the information was subject to change , as more facts were gathered and analyzed by the intelligence community " in a press conference at the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) conference in @entity181 earlier this month			2

@entity188 testified before @entity74 about the security precautions			0
documents show @entity188 denied repeated requests for additional security in @entity17			0
@entity20 resignations follow @entity16 report but there is no reason to think @entity3 's presidential prospects are dimmed , political experts say			1
positive public support before the report came out , @entity3 had enjoyed wildly popular approval ratings in nationwide polls			1

similar polls from @entity215 / @entity214 , @entity216 / @entity217 and the @entity218 showed consistent high marks			0
" the report certainly is n't the ' hail and farewell ' @entity3 hoped for , and it is n't pretty			1
but two points : @entity3 has been in the national public eye for 20 years , so any new piece of information is put into a much larger context			2
that will help her , " said @entity228 , director of the @entity230 's @entity229			0
though the @entity16 attacks will likely come up should @entity3 venture a presidential run , the impact will have lessened , @entity228 said			1
" think about 2012 when @entity16 was a fresh issue			2
how much did it help the @entity73 in the end ? somewhere between nada and zilch			0
only a small portion of the electorate seemed interested , and overwhelmingly , they were already voting @entity73 , " @entity228 said			0
" i have a hard time believing that @entity16 will make much difference after the passage of four more years			0
" i do not believe the @entity16 case will have any impact on her presidential prospects			0
no one in public life for as long as she has been has an absolutely blemish - free record , and hers is vastly more distinguished and blemish - free than most , " @entity125 said			0
" further , truth be told , the misfires prior to @entity16 really occurred much farther down the food chain within the @entity20 , " he said			1
" suggesting errors in judgment regarding a particular post in a particular country fall within the direct purview of the @entity120 is a gross misreading of the nature and demands of her job			0
" @entity1 's @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0
