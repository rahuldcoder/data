@entity0 -- the first race in @entity3 is just around the corner and @entity6 teams are gearing up for a season which promises to be as technical as it is tactical			1
cars converge in 2013 with the sport 's governing body , the @entity11 announcing minor changes to technical regulations , teams have mostly tweaked their cars in 2013 , says @entity6 journalist @entity17			1
" there are big rule changes coming up next year so the teams are trying to balance their resources			0
they do n't need to completely go out and redesign their chassis , it 's just a few little features that they want to incorporate			1
no one has produced a massively different or a massively exciting car this year , " he said			0
@entity31 and @entity32 both spoke of " evolution " at their respective car launches with @entity31 's chief technical officer @entity35 saying the focus had been on the details of the new @entity38			1
" we 've tidied up some bits we thought could be improved upon -- but as is usual these days , this is a car in transition , " said @entity35 at the @entity38 's launch			1
@entity43 revs up for glory " there will be one or two new parts appearing by the first race , which i 'm sure is the same for everybody			0
after that it 's going to be about development through the year , " @entity35 added			1
@entity54 team boss @entity53 says the new @entity55 is a " clear step forward in design and detail sophistication over its predecessor , " while @entity56 have continued their design themes with the @entity58 , according to technical chief @entity59			0
@entity64 crashes out in @entity65 " everyone seems to be converging on the same solutions , " @entity17 says			0
" you could almost get an identikit of a nose , a front suspension , a sidepod and a rear suspension and you could shuffle those parts around and pretty much come up with every car on the grid			0
" @entity78 - based @entity77 are perhaps an exception to the rule this year , unveiling a car with a new silver livery and noticeably slimmer sidepods			0
" rather than air being sucked into the radiators , the air is going straight over to the exhaust -- this benefits in terms of lower drag , " explains @entity17			0
" their car this year , as it was last year , is a bit of a tour de force in terms of good ideas and it 's not surprising that @entity31 have copied two or three of their ideas on this year 's car			1
" @entity77 might be seen as one of the teams that win the design race , but do n't necessarily get the race - to - race results that that deserves			0
" ' tsunami of regulatory change ' as @entity17 says , imminent rule changes are looming in team 's rear view mirrors			1
" there is an absolute tsunami of regulatory change in 2014 , " says @entity109			1
" the cars need to be reinvented from scratch			1
" the biggest change is the engine , says @entity117 , with a 1.6 - liter v6 engine replacing the 2.4 - liter @entity119			1
" the engine is producing a lot less power , but what you will have is a far more powerful hybrid / @entity125 ( @entity125 ) set - up			0
" " you will have the conventional kers -- which obviously charges under braking -- and you can also have a @entity125 device which attaches to the turbo charger , so when your off the power , you 'll be generating energy through the turbo charger			0
it 's called thermal energy recovery			1
" this will give you more than double the power output -- ( this year , ) it 's about 80 hp for 6.7 seconds , next year you will probably get 150 hp for about 30 seconds			2
" there 's lots of other stuff going on			2
all the stuff that bolts to the back of the car and all the cooling that requires will be completely different next year , " @entity17 says			0
@entity144 : ' @entity56 can win @entity145 ' to ignore all these changes would mean being uncompetitive in 2014 , says @entity109			2
" so , ( the @entity58 ) needed to be developed while being squeezed on both sides from 2012 and 2014 -- that 's a significant logistical challenge , " @entity109 said			1
will tire changes make for a gripping season ? @entity151 's new tires are the most significant change this season , says @entity31 's @entity35			1
according to the @entity157 - based company , the introduction of new softer compound tires will improve laps times and increase overtaking			1
" after a spectacular start with seven winners from the first seven races , the result at the end of the year was races with less competition and sometimes only one pit stop			0
this phenomenon was also observed in 2011 , disappointing many fans , " @entity168 , @entity151 's motorsport director said when the tires were launched in january			1
" our 2013 range of tires mixes up the cards once more to help overtaking and ensure two to three pit stops per race , " he added			1
@entity151 say that this year 's hard compound tire ( with new orange coloring on the tire sidewall ) is " roughly equivalent to last year 's medium compound " with the " performance gap between the different compounds now in excess of 0.5 seconds per lap. " softer compounds mean quicker tire wear , says @entity17			1
" there will be no one - stop races because the tires just wo n't last that long			2
drivers will have to manage the tires			2
strategy is going to be really critical this year in terms of teams thinking ' do we go for extra tire stops or eek out ( the maximum from ) a set of tires ? " he said			2
" as we saw last year , if you try and run too long on a set of tires they drop off a cliff and lose all performance			2
that could happen quite quickly with some of the tires this year , particularly if we get a hot season			1
" the teams and drivers have been getting to grips with the new tires at pre-season testing in @entity65 , @entity216			2
" with these tires , you 're always on your toes , " said @entity217 and @entity218 -- who topped the timesheets on the first day of testing -- and they talked of a " different feeling " compared to last year			2
" i think it is a better tire			0
it will be tricky again in terms of laps and degradation , but @entity151 has done a great job getting a wider range for the tires			1
" one thing that i have noticed -- you are able to go fast immediately , even on lap one			0
that is something that we could n't do last year , " @entity218 told @entity6			1
who will set the pace in 2013 ? so who will reign in 2013 ? will @entity31 lead the way again ? can @entity32 claim a first constuctors ' title in five years ? or will @entity245 end a 15 - year drought in their 50th anniversary year ? " i think you will have @entity32 , @entity31 and @entity245 setting the pace			1
i do n't see that any of them are going to have any degree of dominance			0
i think it will be a lot tighter , " says @entity17			2
" but like last year i think you 're going to get spurious results in the first third / half of the year as teams get to grips with the tires			2
you 're going to have a situation like last year where @entity261 can win in a @entity263 because they got the tires working right			0
" " the people who have built a good car and have the tires sussed out -- @entity77 , @entity263 , @entity56 -- could be quite threatening as well			0
" as for the technical aspects , @entity17 says look out for the development of the exhausts and sidepods and @entity273 perhaps the most intriguing technical unknowns lie with how teams develop their exhausts , sidepods and their @entity273 ( known as @entity273 ) , says @entity17			0
" ( @entity273 ) is a bit of a killer app - type solution			0
no one 's got it working yet			0
there will be a number of teams who will try and run it at different races			0
but really the key thing will be how the teams manage the tires			0

@entity291 changes to @entity6 cars for 2013 prior to ' tsunami of regulatory change ' in 2014
new @entity151 tires are most significant changes in 2013 says @entity31 's @entity35
new softer compounds designed to be faster but will degrade more quickly
fight between @entity32 , @entity31 and @entity245 expected to tighter in 2013
