-- a @entity2 jetliner sustained substantial damage when its nose gear collapsed during landing in @entity6 and it skidded down the runway , injuring 10 people			1
the @entity9 said on tuesday that the extent of damage to the @entity12 prompted it to launch a full investigation of monday 's incident at @entity15			0
" when the nose wheel collapsed it did n't just neatly fold back up there but it produced collateral damage in the nose wheel well , " safety board spokesman @entity16 told @entity0			2
separately , @entity2 reached out to flight 345 passengers , some of whom reported chaos and confusion in the cabin as the plane slid down 7,000 - foot @entity28 with its nose scraping the tarmac			1
airline officials , in e-mails obtained by @entity0 , apologized for the " unexpected experience " and inconvenience and expressed concern for their well being			0
@entity2 is refunding air fares and sending them complimentary tickets for future travel			1
@entity2 , the largest domestic airline , did not respond to efforts by @entity0 to confirm the e-mails			1
passengers recounted the final harrowing moments of what had been a delayed , but uneventful flight from @entity46			2
@entity47 , a passenger , said a " strong jolt " shook the cabin when the gear failed and the nose slammed into the tarmac at about 5:40 p.m. et. " it was just a bang and a bounce , and then a slam on the brakes and a skidding feeling , " @entity47 told @entity0 's " @entity58 360Â °			1
" " i feel extremely blessed to have come off that , " she said			0
" it just really felt like the plane could have broken in half , it was such a hard impact			0
" fellow passenger @entity63 said the situation was " pretty chaotic			2
" " we hit the ground pretty hard and slid , " she said			0
" there was a lot of smoke filling the plane , just a lot of smoke and burnt rubber			0
" another passenger said it felt like the plane crashed and then skidded to a stop			1
" everything in the plane that was loose went flying forward , " @entity78 said			0
" there were cell phones , @entity83 , books ( and ) drinks all skidded up			2
" passengers escaped the plane down emergency chutes			2
@entity15 flight delays related to the incident impacted the morning rush as crews removed the disabled twin - engine jet from the edge of the runway where it came to rest			2
it was towed to a hangar			2
by evening , delays had returned , but they were tied to normal stormy summer weather along the @entity102			0
@entity9 protocol involves reviewing cockpit voice and data recorders as well as interviewing crew members and reviewing flight logs and maintenance records			0
@entity109 and the @entity110 will also be party to the investigation as is customary			0
@entity2 said in a statement that it was working with the @entity9 and @entity109			1
the plane , which entered service nearly 14 years ago , was last inspected on july 18 , @entity2 said			1
no details about the inspection were released			2
in addition to 10 hurt on the plane , a @entity119 police officer was treated for heat exhaustion , the agency said			0
initially , the @entity110 said the crew reported a possible nose gear problem before landing but later amended that to say no issues were noted ahead of time after a review of air controller tapes			1
the @entity130 has a conventional hydraulic landing gear system -- a unit under each wing and a steerable wheel that extends from under the nose			1
pilots can land safely with only the main gear operable as those wheels absorb the weight of the plane when it first meets the runway			0
the nose is then set down for the remainder of the landing roll			1
nose gear problems on commercial jets occur from time to time , but the crew normally would be alerted to any issue during approach by warning lights and would have time to abort a landing or come in on just the back wheels			1
@entity2 is the biggest domestic airline and flies only 737s			1
it has more than 600 of the workhorse aircraft in its fleet			0
monday 's incident followed a runway crash of an @entity159 jetliner in @entity160 last month			0
investigators in that crash will not determine a cause for several months at least , but initial attention has focused on actions of the crew during approach			0
in may : plane lands without landing gear at @entity170 @entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 , and @entity173 contributed to this report .			1
