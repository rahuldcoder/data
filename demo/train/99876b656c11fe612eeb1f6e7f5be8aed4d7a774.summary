@entity0 -- safely back on @entity3 soil , freed @entity3 @entity4 and @entity4 on sunday recounted their two years in " a world of lies and false hope " behind the walls of an @entity11 prison			1
wearing green shirts and big smiles , @entity4 and @entity4 landed at @entity14 four days after their release by @entity11 authorities			1
in a news conference following their arrival , they described long days held in isolation , the hours punctuated by the screams of other inmates , and their " total sham " of a trial			1
" releasing us is a good gesture , and no positive step should go unnoticed , " @entity4 told reporters sunday afternoon			2
" we applaud the @entity11 authorities for finally making the right decision regarding our case			2
but we want to be clear that they do not deserve undue credit for ending what they had no right and no justification to start in the first place			0
" @entity4 , @entity4 and @entity4 's now - fiancee , @entity4 , were arrested after straying across the unmarked border between @entity42 @entity41 and @entity11 in july 2009			1
@entity4 was released in 2010 , but @entity4 and @entity4 were freed only wednesday , after 781 days in captivity and a trial for espionage that @entity4 said was based on " ridiculous lies			1
" " @entity4 , @entity4 and i have experienced a taste of the @entity11 regime 's brutality			1
we have been held in almost total isolation from the world and everything we love , stripped of our rights and freedom , " @entity4 said			2
he urged @entity11 to release all political prisoners immediately , telling reporters , " there are people in @entity11 who have been imprisoned for years for simply attending a protest , for writing a pro-democracy blog or for worshiping an unpopular faith			1
" but he also criticized the treatment of prisoners held in @entity3 facilities , such as the military 's prison camp for suspected terrorists at @entity69 , @entity70			1
" in prison , every time we complained about our conditions , the guards would immediately remind us of comparable conditions at @entity69 , " he said			0
while the hikers do n't believe @entity3 policies " justify what has been done to us , " he said , " we do believe that these actions on the part of the @entity3 provide an excuse for other governments , including the government of @entity11 , to act in kind			1
" they said they were held in near - complete isolation in @entity87 's @entity86 , allowed a total of only 15 minutes of telephone calls with their families throughout their ordeal			2
@entity4 said the two had to wage repeated hunger strikes in order to even receive letters from their families			2
@entity11 authorities told them their families had stopped writing , that they would receive due process of law and that the @entity102 ambassador -- who represents @entity3 interests in @entity11 -- was not interested in seeing them			1
worse , @entity4 said , " many times -- too many times -- we heard the screams of other prisoners being beaten , and there was nothing we could do to help them			1
" @entity4 said @entity4 was beaten and @entity4 was forced down a flight of stairs during their captivity			2
she was released on medical grounds in september 2010 , and told @entity1 the screams that echoed within @entity87 's notorious @entity86 " will always be with me			2
" " i do n't know what was being done to them , " she said			0
" but not being able to help another human being , being completely impotent and unable to do anything to ease their suffering , is something i 'll never forget			0
" @entity11 authorities released @entity4 and @entity4 on wednesday			1
they first were flown to @entity125 , where they enjoyed several days of freedom after their lengthy captivity			0
@entity4 's mother , @entity129 , told @entity1 their families " were hooting and hollering and waving our scarves " when they landed			2
" we could n't wait for them to get to us ... i could n't have asked for anything better , " she said			0
and @entity4 's mother , @entity134 , said the families have n't heard " a whole lot of details " from their sons since their release			1
" we have taken the time to just sit and talk and regather , " @entity134 told @entity1			0
" we 've been very busy traveling , " she said			0
@entity134 said they were held as " political pawns			0
" @entity4 and @entity4 blamed three decades of hostility between the @entity3 and @entity11 for making their plight worse than that of other @entity147 who had strayed into @entity11 territory			1
" it was clear to us from the very beginning that we were hostages , " @entity4 said			0
" this is the most accurate term because , despite certain knowledge of our innocence , @entity11 has always tied our case to its political disputes with the @entity3 " but , @entity4 said in hindsight , " i do n't believe that @entity11 got anything good out of this			1
" i do n't believe it was good for the country , and it certainly was n't good for the @entity11 people , whom i admire and support in their struggle for democracy and freedom , " she said			0
@entity4 and @entity4 thanked the numerous people in @entity3 and abroad who helped secure their freedom , including their @entity11 attorney , @entity171			1
@entity171 " was never allowed to represent us properly , but he never gave up , " @entity4 said			0
@entity4 said no one has ever taken credit for paying her bail or those of @entity4 and @entity4			0
she and @entity4 became officially engaged on friday , although he proposed to her during their time in prison			0
" when @entity4 was about to walk out of @entity86 last year , we vowed to each other that none of us would be entirely free until all of us were free , " @entity4 said			0
" that moment has now thankfully come			0
" @entity1 's @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
