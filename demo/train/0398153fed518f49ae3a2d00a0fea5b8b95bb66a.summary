@entity0 -- absent an unforeseen agreement , $ 85 billion in widely disliked spending cuts begin to take effect friday			1
the cuts are a product of the sequester , which @entity8 and president @entity9 agreed to in hopes of making such slashing so unpalatable that it forces them to reach an alternative			1
so what did many lawmakers do the day before the painful cuts take effect ? @entity18			2
" i think the sequester is crazy , i think the president had to show more leadership , @entity8 should do more , " said rep. @entity19 , a @entity20 heading back to @entity21			2
" but just to sit here by myself serves no purpose			1
" @entity19 was one of many congressmen who , before noon on thursday , walked down the @entity29 steps and into awaiting cars to leave @entity0			2
@entity31 criticized republicans for not even sticking around when the cuts start coming ; republicans , in turn , blasted democrats for not stepping up to do more to reign in spending			1
thus , there was plenty of blame to go around -- but not a lot of action			0
the @entity20 - controlled @entity42 held one vote thursday on the @entity44			2
the chamber had no votes scheduled on friday			0
there will be some movement friday , if for no other reason than that 's when @entity9 would be required to start implementing the cuts through the end of the current fiscal year			1
also , the president is set to meet with congressional leaders from both parties at the @entity42			1
expectations for that meeting are low			0
most observers think both sides will use the occasion to underline their positions heading into the next round of the budget wars -- a possible government shutdown on march 27 , when current federal funding authority expires			0
" i mean , we could stay here ... and not pass ... a bill , " said rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , as he left the @entity29			0
" that 's not any better			0
" @entity9 says spending cuts would be bad for business @entity48 holds show votes on @entity31 , @entity20 alternatives as expected , a sharply divided @entity48 voted thursday afternoon to reject alternative plans put forward by majority leader @entity78 , @entity79 , and minority leader @entity80 , @entity81			1
@entity78 's plan got 51 votes in support while @entity85 's got 38 -- well shy of the 60 needed to clear the 100 - member chamber			0
@entity78 had proposed replacing the current spending cut package with a $ 110 billion blueprint that included placing new taxes on millionaires while cutting agriculture subsidies and defense spending			1
most @entity20 object to new defense cuts and have called any new taxes unacceptable			1
@entity85 wanted to give @entity9 more flexibility to pick a set of replacement cuts by march 15			1
democrats considered the proposal a trap , designed to put more responsibility for the cuts on @entity9 's shoulders			1
critics in both parties considered the idea an abdication of @entity8 's power of the purse			0
@entity111 : why @entity0 ca n't cut wasteful spending who bucked the party line ? nine republicans voted against @entity85 's proposal : @entity118 's @entity117 , @entity120 's @entity119 , @entity122 's @entity121 , @entity124 's @entity123 , @entity126 's @entity125 , @entity128 's @entity127 , @entity130 's @entity129 , @entity132 's @entity131 and @entity134 's @entity133			1
three @entity31 opposed @entity78 's plan : @entity137 's @entity136 , @entity139 's @entity138 and @entity141 's @entity140			2
@entity78 himself also voted against the @entity31 bill , but purely for procedural reasons			2
@entity78 , @entity85 continue to play the blame game " republicans call ( their ) plan ' flexibility			2
' but let 's call it what it really is : a punt , " @entity78 said on the @entity48 floor thursday morning			2
" republicans should give @entity8 true flexibility -- flexibility to cut wasteful subsidies , flexibility to close unnecessary tax loopholes and flexibility to ask the richest of the rich to contribute a little more			0
instead , they 're completely inflexible -- insisting we risk hundreds of thousands of @entity162 jobs , as well as programs that strengthen families and small businesses across this nation			0
" but that should come as no surprise , " @entity78 added			0
" as usual , @entity20 have put the demands of special interests over the needs of middle - class @entity162			2
" @entity173 : @entity20 , avert cuts and share credit @entity85 replied by insisting top @entity31 knew before thursday they lacked the votes to pass @entity78 's proposal			1
" for the president and his allies , that 's really the whole point			0
they want it to fail , so they can go around the country blaming republicans for a ( spending cuts package ) the president proposed , " he said			1
" instead of changing as they promised , @entity0 @entity31 are just turning back to the same old campaign - first strategy they 've employed for years			1
" by the numbers : @entity8 and fiscal delays the @entity81 @entity20 also accused @entity9 of wanting to the make the looming cuts " bite as hard as possible -- all to send a simple message to the public : ' you want to control @entity0 spending , @entity162 ? fine , let me show you much i can make it hurt			1
' " the same game plays out in the @entity42 the back - and - forth was little different , in tone , in the @entity42			0
speaker @entity204 , referred to two @entity20 - authored bills the chamber passed last @entity8 on partisan lines to replace the now - imminent spending cuts			1
@entity31 dismissed the bills , which had no chance of clearing the @entity48 or surviving a presidential veto , as ideological showboating			1
furthermore , the bills are null for the moment since they did n't pass the @entity42 as presently constituted			0
but that did n't stop @entity204 , an @entity215 @entity20 , from trying to put the onus on the @entity31 - led @entity48			1
" we 've done our work , " he said thursday morning			0
senators have " not done theirs			0
the @entity42 should n't have to pass a third bill to replace the ( looming cuts ) before the @entity48 passes one			1
" @entity9 says spending cuts would be bad for business @entity225 says spending cuts = war on women friday " is the beginning of @entity232 , " @entity42 minority leader @entity225 , @entity228 , told reporters on @entity230			1
" we like to think of it as @entity235 , acknowledging our history , seeing what more we have to do			0
and why i mention these two points is because of the impact of ( the current spending cuts package ) on women			1
it is specific , it is large , and it 's substantial , and it must be avoided			0
" " just consider this , " @entity225 added			0
" cuts to women 's health from prenatal care to cancer screenings , cuts to services , to victims of domestic violence -- $ 20 million will be cut out of the @entity255 account			2
... cuts to initiatives to support children and families , like @entity260 ( the @entity261 ) and @entity262 , cuts to public sector jobs , where women are 50 % more likely than men to be employed , and therefore fired			0
" @entity31 " come to @entity0 to be legislators , " she insisted			1
" somehow , that piece is missing in what the @entity20 are doing here			2
they 're just making noise			0
they 're just saying something that might have good sound for domestic consumption back home			0
but they did not come here to legislate			0
" immigration detainee release under fire @entity1 's @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 contributed to this report .			0

@entity288 : " just to sit here by myself serves no purpose , " says @entity20 congressman leaving @entity0
@entity9 and @entity293 leaders are set to meet friday , but hopes for progress are low
@entity48 rejects *competing* @entity31 and @entity20 alternatives to the current cuts
republicans , @entity31 blame each other for $ 85 billion in widely disliked spending cuts
