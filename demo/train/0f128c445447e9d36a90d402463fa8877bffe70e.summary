i do n't see a reason why there should n't be a @entity4 era just as @entity16 had theirs with @entity6			0
" @entity4 claimed the constructors ' title in 2010 to complete a clean - sweep of the sport 's top honors , and the @entity35 - based @entity34 marque have been equally successful in 2011 with @entity3 winning six of the season 's opening eight races			2

" @entity3 , who also became @entity2 's youngest champion with his 2010 success , extended his contract with @entity4 until 2014 in march this year , but had previously been linked with a switch to @entity60 outfit @entity16			1
@entity3 , who started his career at @entity62 in 2006 before joining @entity63 in july 2007 , said he admired the proud history of teams like @entity16 and @entity15 , but he insisted he was happy with @entity4			2
" i feel completely happy at @entity4			0
of course @entity16 and @entity15 do come with a huge legend , but i am not into myth right now			0
what 's important for me is that when i come from the track and look in the mirror in my hotel room i want to be able to say , ' yes , that 's me and i am satisfied with what i see			0
' " after @entity11 it feels good to know that i do n't have anything to prove to myself anymore			0
" @entity6 returned to racing with @entity15 at the beginning of the 2010 campaign , having originally retired from @entity2 in 2006			1
the veteran driver has struggled for form since making his surprise comeback , with his recent fourth placing at the rain - affected @entity83 @entity82 a rare highlight			0
