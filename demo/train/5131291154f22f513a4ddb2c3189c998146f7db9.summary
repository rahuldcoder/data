in the final hours of a visit meant to demonstrate the deep societal ties between the @entity3 and @entity4 , president @entity0 briefly broke from his gushing praise for the new prime minister to make a soft but undisguised push toward gender equality and religious freedom			1
speaking to an audience of students and activists in @entity14 , @entity0 declared the @entity3 was @entity4 's best - suited partner as it makes rapid economic advances and appears poised to overtake @entity17 to become the world 's most populous nation			1
but he did n't veil his take on recent attacks against women here , urging the country away from violence against women and religious minorities			1
recent rapes in @entity4 have put harsh focus on @entity4 's gender politics			1
" every girl 's life matters , " @entity0 said in @entity14			0
" every daughter deserves the same chance as our sons			0
and every woman should be able to go about her day — to walk the street , or ride the bus — and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves			0
" sexual assaults became a high - profile problem in @entity4 after a young woman was gang - raped on a bus in @entity14 in 2012			0
subsequent incidents of sexual violence — including at the hands of an @entity52 driver — placed global scrutiny on @entity4 's laws and culture			1
@entity0 traveled to @entity4 in the hopes of capitalizing on the deep personal warmth he 's quickly developed with the new @entity4 prime minister @entity59 , whose effervescent welcome for the @entity3 president was covered enthusiastically and exhaustively by @entity4 media			1
that 's a distant cry from @entity59 's arrival in the @entity3 in september , which was marred by awkward questions over his visa status			0
@entity59 , a member of the right wing @entity68 nationalist @entity67 , had previously been denied entry to the @entity3 for an alleged role in a massacre of @entity73			0
@entity0 said on tuesday it was the responsibility of every citizen to uphold the freedom of religious that 's enshrined in @entity4 's constitution			1
" every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose , or to practice no faith at all , and to do so free from persecution and fear , " @entity0 said			0
@entity0 's parting speech tuesday was one of his few moments apart from @entity59 during his stay in @entity4			2
the pair hugged upon @entity0 's arrival , sipped tea and meandered through a formal garden , and sat for hours behind rain - splattered bulletproof glass reviewing the annual @entity97 parade			2
@entity99 officials say the level of personal interaction between the leaders exceeded even their already - high expectations , and claim the relationship greased the way for progress on a civilian nuclear deal to allow @entity3 firms to construct power plants in @entity4			2
both sides also moved toward more defense cooperation and trade pacts			0
but despite their talk of cooperation , obvious differences persist between the @entity3 and @entity4 that could preclude cooperation on areas like combating climate change			0
during his remarks tuesday , @entity0 said @entity4 must commit to reducing emissions that cause climate change , even as the manufacturing and power plants that produce that pollution drive @entity4 to new economic heights			2
" here 's the truth : even if countries like the @entity3 curb our emissions , if growing countries like @entity4 — with soaring energy needs — do n't also embrace cleaner fuels , then we do n't stand a chance against climate change , " @entity0 said .			1
