" how can this occur ? foreign accent syndrome is an extremely rare condition in which brain injuries change a person 's speech patterns , giving them a different accent			1

since then there have been only a few dozen reported cases			2
" it 's an impairment of motor control , " said dr. @entity36 , one of the few experts in foreign accent syndrome			1
" speech is one of the most complicated things we do , and there are a lot of brain centers involved in coordinating a lot of moving parts			2
if one or more of them are damaged , that can affect the timing , melody and tension of their speech			0
" in a sense it 's not a communication impairment -- a person can make themselves understood perfectly well			2
" but foreign accent syndrome can be psychologically difficult for sufferers			1
" there can be a lack of understanding of how difficult it can be for the person with the acquired accent , " said @entity36			2
" there 's sort of a response of , ' get rid of the accent , stop putting it on , go back			2
' if you think about your own accent , it 's a part of your identity			2
changing your accent projects a different identity			2
