-- during a family trip to the beach last month , 4 - year - old @entity1 fell and scraped his right knee			1
that 's not unusual ; little boys do all the time			0
it 's what emerged from his swollen knee that makes this a tale worth telling : a snail			2
@entity1 of @entity14 , @entity15 , was walking along the beach when he dinged his knee against a rock			1
" we just cleaned it up , put a @entity22 on it , " his father , @entity19 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity20			0
" before you know it , a couple weeks later , his knee was very swollen and somewhat infected			2
" a doctor told @entity1 's mom , @entity27 , that it might be a nasty staph infection			2
antibiotics helped , but there was a growing black bump underneath the skin			1
tired of waiting and certain the wound needed to be drained , the mom decided to take matters into her own hands			0
she squeezed it with her fingers and out it popped			0
" it looked like a rock			0
it was a black thing , " she told the station			2
" i put it on a paper towel and i 'm like , ' that is a weird looking rock			0
it has swirls on it , ' and i turn it over and it is a sea snail			1
" the family figures a snail egg got under @entity1 's skin when he scuffed up his knee			1
and little @entity1 's reaction ? " i thought it was kind of crazy , " he said			1
but not so crazy that the preschooler did n't take ownership of the find			0
