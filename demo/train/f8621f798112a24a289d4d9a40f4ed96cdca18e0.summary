@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 started withdrawing its last remaining citizens saturday from the manufacturing zone jointly operated with @entity5 following weeks of tensions between the two			1
@entity7 this week shunned an offer by @entity0 to hold talks over the @entity10 after it halted activity there this month			1
the complex in @entity5 was one of the few symbols of @entity16 cooperation			0
@entity1 's @entity17 announced that 126 workers and 63 trucks departed @entity10 , which lies just north of the @entity20 , the heavily fortified border that separates @entity21			1
in the past two months , tensions on the @entity23 have been rich in saber - rattling and short on concrete actions			0
but the @entity10 complex , which houses the operations of more than 120 @entity1 companies , appears to have become a significant victim			2
growing suffering @entity30 said the decision to withdraw the @entity1 was a result of their " growing suffering caused by the unjust actions of the @entity5 , " which has been preventing workers , as well as food and medical supplies , from crossing the border into the zone for the past several weeks			2
in an apparent last ditch attempt to resolve the crisis thursday , @entity1 proposed formal talks with the @entity5 , warning of serious consequences if the offer was rejected			1
' @entity48 ' offer rejected but the @entity5 spurned the proposal			2
in a statement on state media friday , a spokesman for the @entity51 described @entity0 's offer of talks about the complex as " deceptive			1
" it said that if @entity0 " keeps aggravating the situation , " it would " be forced to take the final decisive and crucial measure first			0
" the @entity1 in the complex are believed to have been looking after the idle factories there			0
@entity30 said friday that the @entity1 government would support the companies invested in the complex so they can continue with their business activities			1
suspending activity earlier this month , during a frenzy of fiery rhetoric directed at @entity1 and the @entity69 , the @entity5 began blocking @entity1 from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border			1
it then pulled out the more than 50,000 @entity5 who work in the zone 's factories , saying it was temporarily suspending activity there			2
the move surprised some observers since @entity10 was considered to be a key source of hard currency for the regime of @entity81			0
the situation on the @entity23 deteriorated after the @entity5 carried out its latest underground nuclear test in february , prompting the @entity84 to tighten sanctions on the regime in @entity7			0
the tougher sanctions , together with joint @entity69 - @entity1 military training exercises in @entity1 , intensified @entity5 's threats against @entity90 and @entity0			1
the @entity92 's ominous language , which unnerved the @entity69 enough for it to move missile - defense systems into the region , had appeared to calm somewhat recently			0
and the @entity69 - @entity1 military exercises are due to end in the coming days			0
@entity2 's @entity96 reported from @entity0 , and @entity97 reported and wrote from @entity98 .			0
