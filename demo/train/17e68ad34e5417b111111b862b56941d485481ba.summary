@entity0 -- a @entity4 villager has spent almost $ 320,000 on constructing six floating survival pods that are built to withstand tsunamis , earthquakes and other natural disasters , @entity0 's @entity2 has reported			1
the pods , weighing four tons each and consisting of two thick layers of fire - proof and shock - resistant carbon fiber , sit in @entity14 's yard in @entity15 , a small village in the northern @entity4 province of @entity18			1
with december 21 looming , a date when some have predicted the apocalypse would occur , the bizarre contraptions have attracted a huge amount of attention , but @entity14 told the @entity2 that his motivation for building them went further back			2
while the @entity29 disaster movie ' 2012 ' and the 2004 @entity31 tsunami were factors , @entity14 said he ultimately made the decision to build the pods after his village was swept by doomsday rumors in the early 1990s			1
despite assuring his young daughter that the end was not nigh , @entity14 said the girl asked him to build an indestructible house			1
now , @entity14 is making good on that promise			2
the airtight spheres have varying interiors , but they all come with oxygen tanks and seatbelts , and each is equipped to hold about 14 people			0
they are designed to remain upright when floating in water			0
some people in his village thought he was crazy when he began construction in march , and both his daughter and wife tried to talk him out of the project			0
but @entity14 is hoping that governments and international organizations will adopt his pods and use them in natural disasters			1
" men do n't just live to make money , " the @entity2 quoted him as saying			0
" my design could be used by cruise ships to save lives			0
if anyone survives a shipwreck with my device , i will call it a good investment			0
