-- he 's used to holding trophies aloft on sundays but all @entity3 is clutching at the moment is his back			1
for the second week running the world no. 1 has been beaten by back spasms , sparking concern over his ability to mount a serious challenge at the masters which gets underway on april 10			1
after pulling out during the final round of the @entity14 at @entity15 , @entity3 challenge at the @entity17 was blunted by spasms which started after hitting a ball from an awkward stance in fairway bunker at the par four sixth at @entity24 's @entity23 course			1
" that 's what set it off and then it was done after that , " @entity3 said following a frustrating round , @entity25 reported			1
" just ( tried to ) see if i could actually manage through to keep the spasms at bay			2
but anything in the flexion was done , so the deeper the flexion , the worse it felt			0
" woods ended up posting a six - over par 78 to finish tied for 25th after playing his way back in contention for the lead with a superb round of 66 on saturday			1
" if i feel good , i can actually make a pretty decent swing , " @entity3 said			1
" you saw it ( on saturday )			2
but if i 'm feeling like this , it 's a little tough			0

his current back problems first emerged during the final round of the @entity58 tournament last august -- a complaint he put down to a soft mattress in a hotel room			1
the 14 - time major champion now has 10 days off before his next scheduled event -- the @entity64 at @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 which starts on march 20			0

he will not need reminding that he last won the masters way back in 2005 and has n't won a major of any description since the @entity87 in 2008			0
