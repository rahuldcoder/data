@entity0 -- @entity2 remained tight - lipped thursday about its stance on @entity5 leaker @entity4 , who is believed to be holed up in a safe house somewhere in the semiautonomous territory of @entity0			1
@entity4 provided fresh fuel wednesday for the controversy he has sparked , telling a @entity0 newspaper that @entity12 intelligence agents have been hacking networks around the world for years , including hundreds of computers in @entity2			1
in the interview with the @entity17 , he also said he plans to stay in @entity0 to fight any attempt to force him to return to the @entity12 because he has " faith in @entity0 's rule of law			2
" his comments come as the @entity22 is investigating his case			0
his presence in the southern @entity2 territory , which has a separate system of government from the mainland , has raised questions about how an effort by the @entity12 government to extradite him would unfold and what role @entity33 might play in the process			1
but @entity2 's first official comment on the matter gave away no clues			1
" we have no information to offer at the moment , " a spokeswoman for the @entity40 , @entity39 , said in response to a question about @entity4 at a regular news briefing in @entity33 on thursday			1
she repeated the same answer to several follow - up questions			0
@entity4 , 29 , has rocked the @entity50 administration and @entity12 intelligence community by providing documents to journalists revealing the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the @entity12 and the internet activity of overseas residents			1
differing reactions @entity12 security officials homed in on @entity4 after @entity65 's @entity64 newspaper informed the @entity50 administration that it was planning to publish articles based on documents it had obtained , a @entity12 official said			1
authorities then quickly tried to determine who might have access to such information , as well as what documents were downloaded and by whom			0
@entity4 -- who had taken leave from work at an @entity5 facility in @entity79 a few weeks before -- quickly came to their attention , said the official			1
authorities were " making progress " toward pinpointing the source of the leaks when @entity4 went public , said a second @entity12 official			1
both officials spoke to @entity1 on the condition that they not be identified			0
there are " no signs or indications " that @entity4 had accomplices or tried to sell secrets , this official said			1
investigators think the leaker is still in @entity0 and have a general sense of where he is in that @entity101 metropolis			0
@entity4 's case has become a hot issue in that coastal city , making local newspaper front pages , stirring legal debates and prompting plans for a rally in support of him over the weekend			1
the reaction in mainland @entity2 , on the other hand , has been muted			2
state - run media outlets have covered the case cautiously , appearing to try to avoid focusing too much attention on some of the sensitive issues his disclosures have raised , such as government surveillance of citizens			0
the @entity4 story has also so far failed to make big waves among @entity2 's tens of millions of highly active social media users			1
some @entity2 state media took the opportunity thursday to highlight @entity4 's comments to the @entity17 alleging that the @entity12 government has hacked @entity2 targets			1
in recent years , the @entity130 newspaper said in an editorial , " the @entity12 has always claimed itself to be a victim of @entity2 hacking activities			1
many speculate that it 's a cover up for hacking activities conducted by the @entity12 government			2
now , @entity4 's revelation proves that such activities have already been going on for a long time			2
" @entity140 claims among some 61,000 reported targets of the @entity5 , @entity4 told the @entity0 newspaper , are hundreds of computers in @entity2			1
@entity12 officials have increasingly accused @entity2 of being the source of thousands of attacks on @entity12 military and commercial networks			1
@entity33 has denied such attacks			0
the @entity17 said it had seen documents provided by @entity4 but was unable to verify their authenticity			2
the newspaper also said it was unable to independently verify allegations of @entity12 hacking of networks in @entity0 and mainland @entity2 since 2009			1
@entity4 told the paper that some of the targets included the @entity161 , public officials and students			2
the documents also " point to hacking activity by the @entity5 against mainland targets , " it reported			2
the claims came just days after @entity12 president @entity50 pressed @entity2 president @entity170 to address cyberattacks emanating from @entity2 that @entity50 described as " direct theft of @entity12 property			1
" @entity4 's allegations appear to give weight to claims by some @entity2 government officials that the country has been a victim of similar hacking efforts coming from the @entity12			1
his claims came as gen. @entity182 , the @entity5 chief , testified at a @entity184 hearing that the country 's cyberinfrastructure , including telephones and computer networks , is somewhat vulnerable to attack			2
on a scale of one to 10 , " our critical infrastructure 's preparedness to withstand a destructive cyberattack is about a three , based on my experience , " he said			0
in the @entity17 interview -- published one week after the @entity64 revealed the first leaks attributed to @entity4 -- he said the agency he once worked for as a contractor typically targets high - bandwidth data lines that connect @entity202 nodes around the world			1
" we hack network backbones -- like huge internet routers , basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one , " the newspaper quoted him as saying			2
a " backbone " is part of the inner workings of a computer network that links different parts of that network			0
it is used to deliver data from one part of the network to another and , as such , could expose data from multiple computers if hacked			2
' trying to bully ' while refusing to comment specifically on a person under investigation , @entity225 spokesman @entity224 explained clearly how and why @entity12 authorities consider the leaks to be " very serious			2
" " they go right to the heart of our efforts to combat terrorism , to combat efforts by extremists who desire to attack the @entity12 and the @entity12 people , " @entity224 told reporters thursday			2
fbi director @entity239 offered a similar assessment in testimony before @entity242 on thursday			0
" these disclosures have caused significant harm to our nation and to our safety , " @entity239 said			0
" and we are taking all necessary steps to hold the person responsible for these disclosures			0
" @entity4 has n't been charged , but he has told @entity64 that he expects the @entity12 to try to prosecute him			1
he worked for the computer consulting firm @entity250 until monday , when he was fired after outing himself as the leaker			2
@entity4 told the @entity17 that he felt @entity12 officials were pressuring his family and also accused them of " trying to bully " @entity0 into extraditing him to prevent the release of more damaging information			1
he vowed to resist extradition efforts if it comes to that , saying he " would rather stay and fight the @entity12 government in the courts , because i have faith in @entity0 's rule of law			0
" " my intention is to ask the courts and people of @entity0 to decide my fate , " the @entity17 quoted @entity4 as saying			0
" i have been given no reason to doubt your system			0
'' but @entity0 lawmaker @entity273 , a former secretary of security for the territory , said tuesday that while any extradition process could take months , @entity4 is n't necessarily beyond the reach of the @entity12			1
" if he thought there was a legal vacuum in @entity0 which renders him safe from @entity12 jurisdiction , that is unlikely to be the case , " she said			0
legal experts says that @entity33 can get involved in the process to extradite a person from @entity0 if the case significantly affects defense or foreign affairs			0
but some observers say that @entity2 authorities are unlikely to want to rock the boat in this instance			0
" given the somewhat fraught @entity0 - @entity33 relationship , the political impact of @entity33 interference in this @entity0 legal matter could be grave , " the @entity33 - based analyst and blogger , @entity295 , wrote in an article for @entity297			0
the newspaper said @entity4 has been hiding in undisclosed locations in @entity0 since checking out of his hotel room monday , a day after he revealed his identity in an interview with @entity64			1
@entity4 told the @entity17 he is not trying to evade @entity12 authorities			1
" people who think i made a mistake in picking @entity0 as a location misunderstand my intentions , " the newspaper quoted him as saying			0
" i am not here to hide from justice ; i am here to reveal criminality			0
" the @entity5 and the national intelligence director did not immediately respond to a @entity1 request for comment			0
asked during a media briefing wednesday for comment on @entity4 's latest claims , @entity321 spokeswoman @entity320 declined			0
she said she had not seen the latest @entity17 report			0
@entity1 's @entity326 reported and wrote from @entity0 , and @entity327 reported and wrote from @entity328			0
@entity1 's @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 and @entity333 contributed to this report .			0
