@entity1 president @entity0 accepted the resignation of prime minister @entity3 and his government tuesday , amid a political crisis fired by violent protests on the country 's streets			1
@entity3 and his cabinet will continue in their roles until a new government is formed , a notice on the presidential website said			0
@entity0 's announcement comes only hours after @entity3 submitted his resignation and as the national parliament met in an emergency session aimed at ending the crisis			1
in a first step , lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to repeal sweeping anti-protest laws whose passage this month angered anti-government demonstrators			1
the special parliamentary session also looked at legislation that might provide amnesty for more than 200 people arrested since the demonstrations began in late november			1
it 's been adjourned until wednesday , when lawmakers will continue the debate , state news agency @entity31 said			0
but activists on the street have said that while the concessions are a step in the right direction , their fundamental grievances have yet to be addressed			0
' we all want to live in a lawful state , ' says @entity1 protester they want to see wide - ranging constitutional reform and a shake - up of the @entity1 political system			2
the controversial anti-protest laws were rammed through parliament on january 16 by a show of hands by members of @entity0 's @entity53			1
anger about the legislation escalated the long - running anti-government protests into violent confrontations , with police and protesters fighting pitched battles in the icy streets of @entity1 's capital , @entity63			1
division of powers as the crisis has deepened , @entity0 's government has come under increasing pressure both internally and from @entity70 governments concerned about an apparent bid to limit people 's democratic rights			2
@entity74 , leader of the opposition @entity76 party , or @entity76 , told reporters at parliament that the repeal of the anti-protest laws was a small but very important step			1
much remains to be done , he said , according to his party 's website			0
" today , we still have to consider a very important issue on the amnesty and release of all detained demonstrators , " he said			0
" it is also crucial to address the question of the constitutional reform , which will divide powers between a president , a prime minister and the @entity95			1
" in a statement posted on the government 's website , @entity3 said that by quitting he intended to " create more opportunities for social and political compromise for a peaceful settlement of the conflict			0
" that conflict " is a threat to the entire @entity1 society and every citizen , " he said , adding that the government was doing all it could to prevent bloodshed			2
it will likely take more than @entity3 's departure to satisfy the demands of hardy protesters who , despite the bitter cold and threat of violence , have massed in and around central @entity63 's @entity116 , or @entity116 , to demand @entity0 's ouster and new elections			1
in recent days , protests have also spread to other cities around the country			0
@entity122 : ' shameful practice ' @entity3 's resignation may have been a case of jumping before he was pushed			0
he was widely expected to face a vote of no confidence in his government at the special parliamentary session , and his post had already been offered to an opposition leader			0
@entity122 , who heads the @entity133 , refused @entity0 's offer to be prime minister , but @entity3 's position was made almost untenable			1
speaking in parliament tuesday , @entity122 urged the president to sign the law repealing the anti-protest legislation as soon as possible , according to the official @entity31 news agency			1
" i 'm asking @entity0 to immediately sign a law for which the parliament has just voted , " he said			2
" we have finally closed the shameful practice of voting by a show of hands and abolished those laws against which the whole of @entity1 rebelled			1
" @entity150 is also the party of former prime minister @entity152 , who has been imprisoned since 2010 on charges the @entity154 and @entity155 have called politically motivated			1
in a statement monday evening , she called on the opposition to remain firm			0
