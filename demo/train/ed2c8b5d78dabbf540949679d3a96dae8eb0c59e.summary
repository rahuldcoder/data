-- one of the worst - kept secrets in tech has been confirmed : @entity3 will hold an event october 23 in @entity5 , @entity6 , at which the company is widely expected to unveil a smaller , cheaper version of its popular @entity9			1
@entity3 sent e-mails to members of the press tuesday that read simply , " we 've got a little more to show you			1
please join us for an invitation - only event at the @entity16 in @entity5 on october 23 at 10:00 a.m. " unlike last month 's invite to the unveiling of the @entity19 , which contained a not - so - subtle " 5 " in its graphic , tuesday 's colorful rainbow design offered few hints about what @entity3 might announce , although the word " little " could be a clue			1
numerous news reports suggest the secretive company will introduce a 7 - or 8 - inch version of its popular tablet , which currently has a nearly 10 - inch screen when measured diagonally			0
@entity3 has not confirmed any of these reports , of course			0
nor have they revealed what such a mythical device may be called , which has n't stopped the tech media from labeling it the " @entity37			0
" other details about the rumored tablet remain vague , although some analysts predict it will not have the high - definition " retina display " that 's on the current @entity9			0
most observers believe it will be priced under $ 300			0
a smaller @entity9 would allow @entity3 to compete head - to - head with rival small tablets , such as @entity49 's @entity48 and @entity51 's @entity50 , that have weakened @entity3 's domination of the tablet market			2
those devices are priced in the $ 200 range , while @entity3 's current @entity9 lineup starts at $ 399 for last year 's @entity9 and $ 499 for the third - generation ipad released in march			2
tuesday 's @entity3 invite came the same day prices were revealed for @entity60 's upcoming line of @entity62 tablets , which will start at $ 499 and hit stores october 26			1
some reports also say @entity3 will introduce other new products at the event , including a 13 - inch @entity67 with " retina display " and an upgraded @entity69 .			2

@entity3 sent invites to members of the press tuesday for an october 23 event
