there is no shortage of parties to blame for the frightening turn of events in @entity5 over the past week			1
an incomplete list would include , above all , @entity8 , the spearhead of a broader @entity12 @entity11 revolt and the group famously rejected by the @entity15 leadership as too violent and puritanical even for them			0
@entity8 grew out of the former @entity15 franchise in @entity5 that worked so hard after the fall of @entity19 to provoke the sectarian bloodbath that was eventually unleashed in full in 2006			2
also high on the list of culprits would be @entity5 's prime minister @entity23 who rarely misses an opportunity to alienate @entity5 's @entity12 and frustrate openings for reconciliation between the country 's various communities			1
special mention must also go to @entity31 dictator @entity30			2
his decision in 2011 to respond violently to the legitimate , peaceful and democratic demands of his people set off the civil war which provided @entity8 with a new battleground just after @entity12 in @entity5 had turned against it			2
@entity8 exploited this opening to the full , securing control over territory and oil reserves , and methodically building up its strength in preparation for a dramatic return to @entity5			2
some of the greatest offenders , however , are to be found in the west , appearing in television studios or writing opinion pieces , offering their analysis of the situation and advice on what action their successors should take			0
displaying an almost comical lack of self - awareness , @entity55 's vice president @entity54 , former @entity57 deputy defense secretary @entity56 and former @entity59 prime minister @entity58 now deny their past actions had any bearing on the current crisis ( or , in the case of @entity54 , simply ignore their own record completely ) while recommending renewed military engagement from the @entity57 and @entity59			1
responding to the shameless re-emergence of these ghosts from the past may seem like a futile exercise in score - settling , but in fact it is of vital current importance			0
the 2003 invasion was a war of choice , that @entity80 called " illegal " under international law , yet there remains no prospect of accountability for those responsible			0
that being the case , it is vital to ensure that the likes of @entity58 , @entity54 et al are at least forced to pay a political cost for their actions , with the shame that attaches to them acting as a deterrent to any future leader tempted to emulate their record			1
the invasion and subsequent occupation of @entity5 helped lay the ground for the current crisis in a number of important respects			0
the occupying forces set the divisive tone early on , using sectarian quotas to select @entity5 politicians to sit on the @entity108 that acted as the initial fa√ßade to @entity57 authority over " liberated " @entity5			2
the summary dismantling of the @entity5 state and army -- a measure still defended by @entity56 -- hit the @entity12 community disproportionately , further alienating them from the @entity118 settlement			0
@entity5 's descent into a failed state provided conditions that @entity8 , in its original incarnation , was able to exploit to the full			1
of course , the presence of occupying western armies played directly into the @entity15 narrative , acting as a magnet for jihadis from across the region and beyond			0
the horrific abuses uncovered at @entity130 and the @entity57 military 's brutal military tactics -- for example in the devastating assaults on @entity135 in 2004 -- were all gifts to jihadi recruiting sergeants , as was the continued support for the by now @entity141 - dominated @entity140 government as it ran death squads during the height of the civil war			1
the likes of @entity54 , @entity56 and @entity58 , who oversaw all of this , are scarcely qualified to offer authoritative counsel on how to deal with the disastrous effects of their own actions			1
and even if it were not for their own record , their advice does not stand up on its own terms			0
returning to @entity5 with air strikes , or an extension of the extrajudicial execution program that the @entity161 administration has been running with its drone operations in @entity163 and @entity164 , would serve only to inflame the situation further			0
what @entity5 needs , above all , is a political solution whereby @entity12 , who have no love for @entity8 and who have turned decisively against it in the recent past , are given a full part in a government of national reconciliation , independent of compromising foreign interference and capable of reintegrating all @entity5 communities into the new dispensation			1
air strikes in support of @entity23 's rigid , sectarian regime will inevitably lead to major civilian loss of life , deepening divisions and making political reconciliation harder to achieve			0
international jihadis had no real presence in @entity5 before the @entity57 - led invasion of 2003			1
now , in no small part due to the ironically titled " war on terror " waged by @entity54 , @entity56 and @entity58 , those forces now exert joint control over a huge swathe of the country			1
all in all , now would be a good time for the neo-conservatives and liberal interventionists who helped bring us to this point to commence a prolonged period of silence			0
their advice is no longer required			0
read : opinion - @entity54 's amazing chutzpah on @entity5			1

@entity204 : those to blame for @entity5 crisis include @entity8 , *pm* @entity23 , @entity31 's @entity30
main offenders include former @entity210 leaders who are defending their actions - wearing
@entity54 , @entity56 and @entity58 have no right to offer advice on how to deal with the crisis , he adds
@entity5 must not endure more @entity57 military devastation , @entity204 says ; it needs political solution
