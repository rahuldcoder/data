in a four - page letter addressed to @entity29 district judge @entity28 , dated thursday , the union asked the court to throw out the claim against the union because @entity2 " does not allege facts sufficient to overturn the @entity34 " and failed to provide evidence of a breach of the union 's duties in representing him			2
