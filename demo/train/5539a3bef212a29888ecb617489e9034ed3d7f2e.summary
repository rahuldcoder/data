-- it was the best of times in 2004 , when attorney @entity3 graduated from @entity4 and landed a job at a top @entity7 corporate firm , @entity6			1
attorney @entity3 at his new job at @entity9			0
by 2007 , the @entity10 was reporting the most promising year in two decades			0
nearly 92 percent of graduating attorneys were employed , and the median starting salary at private practices had increased by $ 13,000 -- to a total of $ 108,500 a year			1
in the worst economic crisis since the @entity18 , the legal industry is taking an unprecedented beating from the sputtering economy and housing meltdown			0
@entity3 , 37 , lost his job as layoffs and salary freezes have spiked at law firms across the country during the past three months			0
rather than just hand out a severance package with the pink slip , @entity6 gave @entity3 an option			0
he could work for @entity9 , a legal aid group serving people living in poverty			0
the firm agreed to pay @entity3 about a quarter of his former salary for a year			2
@entity3 , who needed to support his wife and a newborn daughter , accepted			0
" this gave me a chance to do something different with my legal career , and help out people who generally do n't have access to public service , " said @entity3 , who now works on foreclosure cases helping victims of predatory lending			0
@entity6 is among many megafirms across the country using the economic slump as an ideal time to lend a hand to cash - strapped public interest and legal aid firms			1
the massive corporate layoffs and program cuts could redirect thousands of young graduates and experienced attorneys from corporate firms into the public sector , legal experts say			1
once insulated , law firms are shedding young and mid-career associates at extraordinary rates			2
this is especially true at large corporate firms that overestimated their growth and extended too many offers to associates last fall			2
@entity70 , a leading global firm with headquartes in @entity72 , made a second round of cuts last week			0
in addition to about 70 associates laid off in november , the firm last week let go of another 400 people , including 200 attorneys			1
other well - known firms such @entity80 and @entity81 on the @entity82 have gone bankrupt in recent months			0
at least 2,149 attorneys have been laid off in 2009 , bringing the total to 3,045 since january of last year , according @entity86 , an industry web site tracking the slump			1
hundreds more associates set to start jobs this fall are bracing themselves for rescinded offers and deferred start dates			2
some students are finding their summers wide open as law firms like @entity98 , based in @entity99 , have canceled internship programs			0
amid all this dark news , there might be a silver lining			0
it could transform the legal profession			0
" there is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity coming out of a difficult situation , " said @entity106 , president of the @entity107 in @entity108 , who began discussions this month with at least 15 corporate firms nationwide about placing unemployed attorneys in public interest firms			1
the project will get under way in a few months , she said			0
other firms have already encouraged attorneys to go into the public sector			1
just last week , one of the largest firms in the country -- @entity125 , based in @entity126 , @entity127 -- announced it will pay deferred associates graduating in 2009 a $ 5,000 monthly stipend for one year if they secure a job in the public interest field			1
international law giants @entity133 and @entity134 offered incoming associates who defer employement until october 2010 a $ 75,000 compensation package			2
while working in public service is n't mandatory for @entity133 associates , the firm said there was a " sincere hope " the deferred associates would " use the intervening period to pursue a community service or other public advocacy projects of their choosing			1
" such deferral plans can save the companies about $ 100,000 per associate , and law experts expect the list of firms enacting deferral programs to grow geometrically as the economy worsens			2
" firms are doing this to be flexible and regulate their labor force because there just is n't as much work anymore , " said @entity157 , executive director of the @entity10			2
corporate giants are also scrambling to find work for mid-level attorneys in the public sector			1
@entity167 , a major @entity72 - based law firm , introduced a yearlong public service fellowship program this year that would pay current attorneys $ 60,000 a year to work in areas such as social service , community development or academia			1

( the proposal was rejected			0
) " you 're meeting a real need in these tough times where you have more of a legal need and fewer resources , " @entity178 said			1
encouraging laid - off and deferred attorneys to go into public service is filling a desperate need at public interest firms			1
public interest and legal aid firms serving the underprivileged have long been under - funded and overwhelmed with cases even in a good economy			1
tightened state budgets and a decline in donations have further stretched resources for the public interest firms , forcing them to make staff cuts at a time when demand for their services is greater than ever before			1
at @entity9 , the public interest firm where @entity3 arrived in january , the effects of a sick economy are apparent			1
@entity213 , the public interest firm 's executive director , has already reduced staff			1
the agency , which handles 15,000 matters a year , expects to make more staff reductions in the coming months because of a $ 2 million funding shortfall			2
" we 're burning through our reserves right now , so it 's nice to have extra help , " said @entity213 , who is talking to another local corporate firm this week about taking in subsidized attorneys			2
some attorneys and law students worry that paying corporate attorneys to work in public interest firms may displace those who actually wanted to work in the public sector in the first place			1
@entity233 , who works with students at @entity235 , said strained legal aid organizations and nonprofits will want to take in the " free " labor			0
nevertheless , there is little doubt that the economic free - fall is changing the ways current attorneys -- and a new generation of young attorneys -- view the field			0
traditionally , law students have equated best jobs with highest - paying jobs , career counselors say			0
students saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt find themselves pressured to work at large firms that will pay enough to cover the bills , said @entity255 , a director at @entity256 , a job placement agency for lawyers			2
many times , going into the public sector is n't even an option , she said			1
" everyone has to rethink all the old models that we believed in , the model where you go to school and then a big firm , " said @entity255 , who graduated from @entity261 in 1998 , a time when law jobs were abundant			0
even students at top law schools are finding that their offers have been rescinded			0
at @entity276 , @entity274 , assistant dean for career services , said he has been working with a handful of students whose job offers have been deferred			1
" it can be a tremendous opportunity for the student to take that year and try something entirely different , " @entity274 said			1
" hopefully within a year , the economic picture will do better			0
" after not receiving a corporate firm job offer in the downtrodden industry , @entity287 , set to graduate this spring from the @entity289 's @entity288 , will instead work for the @entity290			2
" i can see what it 's like to work for a regulatory agency , and that 's a different expertise that attorneys do n't always get to have , " said @entity287 , who will begin working in @entity108 , this august			0
