-- when the time rolls around for @entity4 's annual mammogram , she hears two voices in her head : her gynecologist , who says she absolutely must have a mammogram every single year , and her father - in - law , who urges her to get a mammogram every other year instead			0
while most women would listen to their gynecologist , @entity4 's father - in - law is n't just anyone : he 's the co-author of a new mammography study in the @entity16 , and he says he believes passionately that mammograms might be making women sick -- maybe even killing them			1
" i really do n't know what to do , " says @entity4 , 50 , an anchor and health reporter at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			2
" i feel so conflicted			0
" ' mammography is not perfect ' dr. @entity25 knows his advice to his daughter - in - law is controversial , even heretical in a society where pink ribbons on everything from billboards to yogurt containers remind women to get their annual mammograms			2
here 's his reasoning : his study suggests that nearly one out of every three women diagnosed with breast cancer has a tumor that is so tiny and growing so slowly it would never cause any problems even if it were n't treated			1
the problem is doctors ca n't tell in advance whether a tumor will be harmless or deadly , so they have to treat them all , and some of those treatments , such as chemothreapy , can increase a woman 's risk for leukemia and other diseases			1
" we 're mortals , and we 're still trying to figure this out , " says @entity4 , clinical research professor at the department of radiation medicine at the @entity57 at @entity58			0
the new study also finds that mammograms are n't catching some truly dangerous tumors that later turn out to become advanced cancer			1
mammograms are supposed to catch breast cancer early , but after 30 years of aggressive mammography , advanced breast cancer rates have n't gone down at all , according to @entity4 's study			1
breast cancer prevention : what every woman should know " this study brings to light what we 've already known for some time , which is that mammography is not perfect , " says @entity73 , vice president of research , evaluation and scientific programs at @entity76 for the @entity77			2
study : more than 1 million women ' overdiagnosed ' @entity4 's study , written with dr. @entity86 at the @entity87 , examined national data on mammograms from 1976 to 2008			1
they found that during this time , twice as many cases of early - stage breast cancer were caught -- but they estimate that 31 % of those cancers were slow - growing and never would have made the woman sick			0
breast cancer was " overdiagnosed " in 1.3 million women over the past 30 years -- 70,000 women in 2008 alone , according to the study			2
" that 's a lot of women , and that 's a problem , " @entity4 says			2
the study also found that as mammograms grew in popularity , the death rate from breast cancer went down 28 % in women over age 40 , but the study authors said that was largely due to better treatment , not mammograms			1
tough choices in fight against breast cancer gene the study has already caused controversy			0
the @entity117 issued a statement saying the report was " deeply flawed and misleading " -- a claim the study authors refute			0
dr. @entity122 , deputy chief medical officer of the @entity123 , said while " overdiagnosis is a matter deserving of attention , " the study 's conclusions " must be viewed with caution			1
" what 's a woman to do ? given all this , should women have mammograms every year after age 40 , as currently recommended by most health organizations , or start having them every other year ? @entity4 said after much thought , she 's decided to follow the advice of her gynecologist and not her father - in - law			0
" i 'll keep having a mammogram every year -- my insurance covers it , and i know how my doctor feels about it , " she says			0
" but i 'm open to hearing more about what the science says			0
i think i could live with having it every other year			0
" here are some tips for making your own decision about how often to have mammograms : 1			0
learn the mammogram guidelines @entity76 , the @entity123 and the @entity154 recommend women get mammograms every year starting at age 40			1
the @entity158 advises women to get mammograms every other year starting at 50			0
know your family history screening recommendations are different for certain groups , such as women with a family history of breast cancer and women who 've tested positive for breast cancer genes			0
see the links above for recommendations			0
find out about other screening tools besides mammograms ultrasounds , mris , breast self - exams and exams performed by your doctor can all be used in addition to mammograms			1
keep in mind that mammograms miss many cancers do n't have a false sense of security just because you 've had a mammogram			2
mammograms miss about one in five breast cancers , according to the @entity123			1
realize mammograms catch some cancers that might not ever make you sick this study found that 31 % of newly diagnosed breast cancers never would have caused any harm ; other studies say it 's more like 10 % to 20 %			1
whatever the real percentage is , when you go in for a mammogram , realize that it might pick up a harmless tumor , but you 're going to have to get treatment for it anyway since doctors ca n't yet discern a harmful from a harmless cancer			1
" you should go into this with your eyes open , " says dr. @entity206 , chief medical officer of the @entity123 and @entity0 cancer expert .			2

a new study suggests mammograms find some tumors that would n't be a problem
but those tumors must be treated as doctors do n't know which ones are harmless
researchers say mammograms also fail to catch some dangerous tumors
the @entity123 says the study must be " viewed with caution "
