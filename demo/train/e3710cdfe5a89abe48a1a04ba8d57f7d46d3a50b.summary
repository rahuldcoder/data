one of the women said that when she worked with @entity7 on a movie , he pulled up her shirt to expose her breasts and took a picture , and groped her on two other occasions			1
@entity164 filed a lawsuit , saying @entity7 and his campaign staff tried to discredit her by spreading false information about her			1
@entity7 said he knew nothing about @entity164 's allegations and said the timing of the complaints of the 16 women was " rather odd , " given that no one had filed a complaint against him in the 35 years that he had lived in the @entity138			1
@entity7 issued a general apology for " behaving badly sometimes " but said many of the allegations were not true " because that 's not my behavior			1
" @entity3 took to the campaign trail to defend her husband a day after the allegations surfaced and just four days before the 2003 recall election			2
" you can listen to all the negativity , and you can listen to people who have never met @entity7 , or who met him for five seconds 30 years ago			2

" speaking to reporters after the speech , @entity3 described her husband as " an extraordinary man " and took issue with the characterization that he behaves boorishly toward women			2
" he 's honest , he 's sensitive , he 's sincere			0
and he is gracious with every bone in his body , " she said			0
" i have met thousands and thousands of women who have come up to me and said they have worked with him , they have worked for him , alongside ( him ) and he has been an extraordinary gentleman			0
" she also said she thinks it took " tremendous courage to stand up and say , ' i 'm sorry if i offended anybody			0
that was not my intention			0
' " @entity3 said then that she was not personally hurt by the allegations			2
" nothing hurts , because i know the man that i 'm married to , " she said			0
" has he said and done everything absolutely ( right ) 100 % of the time ? no. but i do n't know anybody on the planet , male or female , who 's led a perfect life			2
