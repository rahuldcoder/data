@entity0 -- she was remembered in her last @entity3 16 years ago -- a near lifetime in an athlete 's career -- as a diminutive figure whose size belied her big ambitions and ability to win @entity3 gold			1
@entity13 , at 5 - foot - 6 and 108 pounds , is now 40 years old , and just as @entity14 made an extraordinary comeback at age 41 to be the oldest swimmer in the @entity18 , @entity12 is now seeking her own @entity19			1
@entity12 has qualified to participate in late june 's trials to make the @entity21 , and if she makes the cut , she will go on to compete in the @entity23 in july			1
when she retired following her last olympics in 1996 , she was considered one of the greatest distance freestyle swimmers of all time , winning four gold medals			1
in all , she competed in three @entity29 -- @entity30 in 1988 , @entity31 in 1992 and @entity32 in 1996			1
she was known for her " unorthodox windmill " stroke , as she puts it			1
now the olympian who began swimming at age 2 and competing at age 4 is seeking her fourth games over a 24 - year period			1
can she conquer the biggest adversary of all -- aging ? in a recent interview with @entity1 at her @entity44 , @entity45 , training facility about 35 miles southeast of downtown @entity0 , @entity12 said she has been working out five hours a day -- with her husband spending more time taking care of their two small children			1
but she still drops the kids off at day care with her hair wet and puts dinner on the table every night , she says			1
" this time has been so much more fulfilling , " she said of her latest @entity3 attempt			1
she has spent the past 16 years as an author , reality tv personality and a motivational speaker			1
" of course , the competitor in me wants to make the @entity3 team , but i also feel like if i do n't , it 's been an amazing journey , " @entity12 added			1
her return to long hours in the pool has agreed with her			2
she swims 10 miles daily , plus 45 - minute workouts in the weight room			2
" it did n't take me as long as i thought to get into a groove , " she said			2
" my family really supported me			2
my husband said he would be home to take care of the kids , and so i found a routine			2
" the @entity75 , @entity45 , resident expects supporters in her quest to make the 2012 @entity3 team , but she also expects her share of skeptics			1
" the hardest part of this comeback was n't physical and was n't scheduling , " @entity12 said			2
" it was the critics			2
and i knew there would be critics out there , and i always had critics in my career			2
" those critics will say things like " you know , she 's 40			0
what is she thinking ? she already had this success			0
leave it for someone else now			0
you 've had your time , " @entity12 said			0
she has a simple answer to those critics			0
" well , if i swim fast enough , who says it 's not my time			1
" @entity12 says she 's proud of the fact " that at 40 , i can come back and actually swim with 17 - year - olds and keep up with them			1
" but she admits to having an occasional bad night of sleep because her daughter or son is up at night			0
her trainer , @entity114 , said returning to swimming shape was n't easy for @entity12			0
" i think for her at 40 , the physical is the more difficult			0
you know she was always in good shape			0
but it was getting back into swimming shape			0
her mental attitude has not changed			0
not a bit , " he told @entity1			0
" predictions in swimming are difficult , but i think @entity13 is going to amaze everybody with how fast she can swim , " @entity114 added			1
@entity12 ' husband , @entity130 , said his admiration for his wife has grown			0
" i understand why 20 - year - olds do this , because i think when you are not in the pool training , you are resting , right , " he said			0
" and for @entity137 at 40 with two kids and working and a mom , she does n't get as much rest as she would probably like , and i respect that even more			0
" @entity1 's @entity141 contributed to this report .			0
