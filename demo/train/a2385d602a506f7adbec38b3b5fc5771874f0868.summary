-- your mission , if you choose to accept it , is to seek out covert items at fast food chains around the country			1
not all food items are always listed on restaurant menus			1
be warned , this mission includes very real dangers such as hardening arteries and skyrocketing cholesterol			0
we 've compiled a list to get you started			0
if you 're at @entity16 and in need of just a little caffeine , do n't worry -- there 's a tiny option for you			2
it 's the @entity22 size , and they do n't advertise it			2
it 's like a little baby cup of coffee			2
it also comes in handy when you 're scrounging for change and do n't have enough for a tall ( not that that has ever happened to me )			0
it 's a good thing we do n't have @entity33 here in @entity35 , because i would be all over candy - based smoothies			1
because it 's considered a health - food chain , @entity33 does n't officially list these on their in - store menus , but the web site @entity43 assures us that the secret flavors exist			1
the ones they confirmed with the company 's headquarters include @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity53 flavors of @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57			2
other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist : chocolate @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , and now and later			0
this one might be my favorite			0
at @entity66 , you can order a @entity67 -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon			1
@entity71 has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available , they will make it for you			1
things that have been tested include nachos , quesadillas , taco salads and single tacos			0
some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item , however , so maybe someday soon you wo n't need a super-secret handshake to order one			2

if you 're at @entity93 and you 're really hungry -- like , three - patties - just - wo n't - cut - it hungry -- go ahead and order the @entity96 , which is four patties stacked on a bun			1
this option is only available at select @entity93 , and it 's also known as the @entity100			1
several places , including @entity102 , will serve you the @entity105 milkshake			1
it 's just what it sounds like -- chocolate , vanilla and strawberry shakes layered in a cup			0
@entity113 's " secret menu " is n't so secret these days -- in fact , they 've posted it on their web site			1
but in case you 're not in the habit of surfing fast food web sites , here 's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items : ordering something " @entity127 " at @entity102 means you 're going to get it with lettuce , tomato , a mustard - cooked beef patty , pickles , extra spread ( it 's sort of @entity134 ) and grilled onions			1
you can even get your fries @entity137			0
@entity0 : why is it called " @entity140 " dressing ? " @entity144 " is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun			0
a @entity145 is two slices of @entity148 cheese , lettuce , tomato and spread on a bun ( grilled onions if you so choose )			0
and you can get just about any combo of meat and cheese that you want if you order it like you 're ordering lumber : 3 × 3 gets you three beef patties and three slices of cheese , 4 × 4 gets you four of each , and so on			0
according to photos posted at @entity165 , one gluttonous patron requested and received a 100x100 at a @entity167 store a few years ago			0
one item not listed on the web site secret menu : the @entity171 , which is two slices of cheese sandwiched between two patties , hold the bun			0
feeling a little health - conscious at @entity177 's ? if you are , you really should have gone somewhere else			1
but there 's a little hope for you -- ordering " naked chicken " will get you breading - free poultry			1
the word is that this is on the menu at some @entity177 's , but not all of them , although it is an option at all of them			1
like @entity71 , @entity186 will make you just about anything within reason as long as they have the ingredients for it			0
since most of the food at @entity186 is made out of the same basic items , that means you can probably ask for most discontinued items and get them			2
one " secret , " though , is that they have a not - advertised green chili sauce at most locations , and apparently it 's excellent			2
some @entity202 will still make you the popular pizza sub from the 1990s			1
once the chain decided to make their focus healthy eating , the pizza sub disappeared from the menu in most places ( the word is that @entity211 and @entity212 @entity202 still offer them on a regular basis )			1
but if you ask , lots of places will still make it for you			0
be warned , though -- @entity218 would not approve of the nine slices of pepperoni and copious amounts of cheese slathered in marinara sauce			0
