-- the top government lawyers from three dozen states sent a letter to @entity4 on wednesday , expressing " strong concerns " with the privacy policy the web giant intends to roll out soon			1
" on a fundamental level , the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by automatically sharing personal information consumers input into one @entity4 product with all @entity4 products , " reads the letter sent to @entity4 ceo @entity9 and signed by 36 state attorneys general			1
last month , @entity4 announced the new policy , which spells out how the company will collect and compile information to create a profile of users based on their activity across all of its various sites and tools			2
that includes @entity4 search , @entity28 , the @entity30 social site and phones running its android operating system			0
privacy advocates objected to the policy -- which is set to go into effect march 1			1
eight members of @entity37 , both @entity38 and @entity39 , wrote their own letter to @entity9 , asking for clarification about the changes			0
in wednesday 's letter , the state attorneys called the policy " troubling for a number of reasons , " saying that users should be able to use one product without having its information shared with others			0
" consumers have diverse interests and concerns , and may want the information in their web history to be kept separate from the information they exchange via @entity28 , " they said			0
" likewise , consumers may be comfortable with @entity4 knowing their search queries but not with it knowing their whereabouts , yet the new privacy policy appears to give them no choice in the matter , further invading their privacy			1
" @entity4 said wednesday it 's willing to discuss the policy with government officials , but that its intention is to make using its products easier and more transparent			2
" our updated @entity74 will make our privacy practices easier to understand , and it reflects our desire to create a seamless experience for our signed - in users , " a @entity4 spokesman said in a written statement			0
" we 've undertaken the most extensive notification effort in @entity4 's history , and we 're continuing to offer choice and control over how people use our services services			0
of course we are happy to discuss this approach with regulators globally			0
" in a blog post when the policy was announced , @entity4 's @entity88 noted that many of @entity4 's products , including @entity93 and search , do n't require users to be signed in to use them			1
other tools allow for " incognito " modes and there are other privacy tools that can be used , she said			0
a later post from @entity4 public policy director @entity101 said that the company 's privacy policies , but not its privacy controls , are changing			1
they are " trying to make them simpler and more understandable , which is something that lawmakers and regulators have asked technology companies to do , " he wrote			0
" by folding more than 60 product - specific privacy policies into our main @entity4 one , we 're explaining our privacy commitments to users of those products in 85 % fewer words			2
" that was n't enough for the attorneys general			1
they singled out users of @entity122 phones , which make up about 50 % of the @entity124 smartphone market , saying they wo n't be able to " opt out " without buying a new phone			0
" no doubt many of these consumers bought an @entity122 - powered phone in reliance on @entity4 's existing privacy policy , which touted to these consumers that ' we will not reduce your rights under this @entity74 without your explicit consent , ' " the letter said			1
" that promise appears not to be honored by the new privacy policy			2
" the letter asks @entity4 to meet with representatives of the attorneys general before the policy goes into effect " to work toward a solution that will best protect the privacy needs of those who use @entity4 's products			1

attorneys general from 36 states object to @entity4 privacy changes
they say policy " appears to invade consumer privacy "
@entity4 says privacy controls are n't changing but the policy is being simplified
the new policy goes into effect march 1 for all @entity4 products
