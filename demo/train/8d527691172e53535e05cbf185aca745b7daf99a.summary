-- anytime i hear about a death that may be linked to addiction , i am reminded that this is a misunderstood and deadly disease			1
deaths caused by addiction have risen astronomically in the past decade			1
drug overdose is now the no.1 cause of accidental death in the @entity10 ; more common than death by car accidents			1
" @entity14 " actor @entity13 , who was found dead at a @entity16 hotel on saturday , had said that he struggled with substance abuse since his teenage years			1
the @entity18 said he died as a result of " a mixed drug toxicity , involving heroin and alcohol			1
" whenever someone with addiction dies , i grieve the lost potential and wonder about the limitations of our ability to address this cunning , baffling and powerful disease			1
i am also humbled by my own experience with addiction and recovery , and grateful for the help i received			1
it seems nearly impossible to believe that people with addiction would continue to use drugs and alcohol to the point of death , but that is what people with addiction do : they deny both the consequences and the risks of using			1
as we continue to learn about addiction , we 're understanding more about why addicted people behave the way they do			1
but that 's little solace for friends and family			0
addiction is a brain disease , and our knowledge of it has expanded significantly , which has informed our treatment programs and altered our perceptions			1
we know that addiction resides in the limbic system , a subconscious part of our brain that is involved with memory , emotion and reward			1
replacing addiction with a healthy obsession we refer to this area of the brain as the reward center , as it ensures that all rewarding or reinforcing activities , especially those associated with our survival , are prioritized			1
the reward center makes sure we survive by eating , drinking fluids , having sex ( for survival of the species ) and maintaining human interactions			0
in late stages of addiction we can see how reward - related drives , especially those for survival , are reprioritized when people risk their families , their jobs , even their lives to continue to use drugs and alcohol			1
the continued use of the drug becomes the most important drive , at a subconscious level and unrecognized by the individual , undermining even life itself			1
when a methamphetamine - addicted mother makes the nightly news after neglecting her children for four days while on a meth run , we ca n't comprehend how anyone could do such a thing and tend to think she does not love her children			0
she may have been going out for groceries with the intent to return home and feed her children , but ran into a dealer and started using			0
addiction took over , and she was driven by subconscious forces even though she loves her children as much as i love mine			1
her love and her natural instincts to care for and nurture her children were overridden by her own brain , the reward system reprogrammed to seek and use drugs at all costs			2
unbeknownst to her , drug use has become the most important thing in her life			2
when we witness the incomprehensible behaviors associated with addiction we need to remember these people have a disease , one that alters their brains and their behaviors			2
we tend to believe we all have free will , so it is difficult to understand how the addicts ' perception has been so altered as to drive them to destruction			0
5 damaging myths about addiction we also assume they can make their own decisions , especially when it comes to help for their addiction			2
in so doing we are expecting the person with a diseased brain to accept the unacceptable , that the continued use of drugs is not providing relief from the problem -- it is the problem , and they need to stop that which has become paramount			2
they are unable to make such decisions because their brains have been altered to prioritize use of the drugs , even above survival itself			2
relief of psychic pain , the real , unimaginable pain of addiction , is part of the problem			2
people have many reasons for seeking relief from pain ; some pain precedes the addiction , but most pain is the result of the addiction			1
the addicted neglect their primary relationships and they may lie , cheat and steal to continue drug use			2
and they know this at some level , they recognize their uncontrolled behaviors , but they ca n't change , they ca n't stop			0
hopelessness becomes a way of life			0
self - loathing , shame and guilt become the norm as the consequences of continued drug use accumulate			2
they use drugs to ease the pain , but the very remedy exacerbates the problem			2
the answer to their dilemma goes unrecognized due to the neurobiological changes that have occurred in their brains			0
from drug addict to yoga instructor the good news is that treatment is effective and specifically designed to help people recognize the problem within			1
most people are coerced into treatment for one reason or another ; they may be facing legal issues , job loss or divorce			0
with good treatment their likelihood for recovery and abstinence is just as good as the minority who seek treatment of their own accord			0
unfortunately , fewer than 10 % of those with addiction recognize they have it and seek treatment			1
this is the primary reason people do n't seek help			0
our largest public health problem goes unrecognized by those with the disease			0
every one of these deaths is tragic			0
they died of a disease that lies to them			0
great talent and intelligence do not protect us from any illness			0
we can safely watch such a tragedy , gawking as we drive by the destruction , insulated from the suffering and unable to help			0
but addiction is all around us and we need to respond to the rising death toll			0
all of us are responsible for learning the truth about addiction , raising awareness and intervening for those who have this disease , knowing they are unlikely to be able to do so for themselves			0
