@entity0 , @entity1 -- for some concertgoers , the @entity3 really kicked into action on day two			1
@entity7 attendees enjoy the music saturday , day two of the @entity3 music festival in @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity11 was leisurely and pleasant -- the weather was mild , the acts were fairly mellow and the big headliner was @entity15			1
on @entity9 , someone took the dial and turned it up a notch , as the desert sun beat down a little harder , the music pumped a little louder and the crowds who packed the vip tent threw a little more attitude			2
there were the usual celebrity sightings			0
@entity27 and @entity28 snuck in the back just as rapper @entity30 hit the stage , @entity32 took in @entity33 and @entity35 's set in the @entity37 tent and @entity38 was spotted making out with a mystery lady near the restrooms			1
forty - six acts performed on five stages scattered about the grassy field of the @entity44 near @entity45 , @entity1			1
massive eco-friendly art installations fashioned from scrap metal and reclaimed wood doubled as shelter from the heat , as well as mini-stages for dancers and performance artists			1
there was good buzz for @entity56 , an indie - pop band fronted by @entity57 and @entity58 , whose vocals are reminiscent of his late father , @entity60 , but warmer , and less haunting			0
" it 's the first festival we 've ever played , and our 12th gig overall , " said @entity58			0
" normally with festivals , people come to check you out , stand in the back , and then move on pretty quickly , even if they like you -- but people stayed ! it 's the best performance we 've ever had			2
" unfortunately @entity70 was not so lucky			0
the @entity71 , @entity72 , group 's delicate baroque harmonies were drowned out by the world music beats of @entity77 's percussion section bleeding over from the neighboring main stage , as one of their female vocalists crowd - surfed			2
as usual , the day 's line - up was a mix of up - and - coming indie artists sprinkled with tried - and - true veteran acts			2
the @entity86 have played @entity3 in both capacities			1
the @entity89 , @entity90 , quartet received their first invitation from festival organizers in 2004 , the same year their debut album , " @entity95 , " was released			0
" we played at 11:30 a.m. in a tent			0
it was 150 degrees out , and backstage , it smelled like horse droppings , " said drummer @entity98 , referencing the fact that there are certain consequences to holding an event on a polo field in the desert			2
this time , as the marquee act , @entity86 enjoyed their own backstage compound decked out with a white picket fence , tablecloths and festive party lights in the shape of daisies			1
palm trees gently swayed in the distance , silhouetted against the desert backdrop			0
you could hear the crowd going crazy for a feisty @entity30 slotted on the main stage before @entity86			1
@entity98 and his three bandmates had just rolled in on their tour bus from @entity89			0
he spoke with @entity2 while warming up his hands and wrists with drumming exercises			0
" with festivals , you have to realize the audience is not necessarily there to see you			0
so we 'll play some stuff off our new album , ' @entity131 , ' and work in some songs that everybody knows , like ' mr. @entity135 ' from our first album			0
" half an hour later , @entity86 took the stage , opening their set with their latest hit , " @entity140			1
" frontman @entity141 soon had the crowd singing the along to the perplexing lyrics , " are we human , or are we dancer ? " at @entity3 , it does n't matter if you 're human or if you 're dancer			1
but if you 're dancer , you 'll probably be relegated to one of the mini-stages inside an art installation			2
" the first time i heard about @entity3 10 years ago , i thought , ' that could be the cool festival here in @entity152 , " said @entity98			0
" it 's since become a successful festival with good bands , swarms of people coming in from all over the world -- even art elements			1
it 's strange to think we 're headlining one night			0
