for now , evacuated children are being comforted and reuniting with their parents at a nearby firehouse where , outside , an @entity29 flag flies at half - staff			2
there , couples enter and exit , some leaving without children and walking silently and tearfully past a nearby cemetery			1
one couple , escorted by firefighters seemed especially shaken -- eyes bloodshot and lips trembling -- stricken by the events of a clearly devastating day			1

" everybody was crying , " @entity51 said			2
" and i just heard the police officers yelling			2
" her mother said she first learned about the emergency through an automated phone call message			2
she said the message was n't clear about the school where the incident had occurred			1
in a panic , she raced to @entity21 , eventually finding @entity51 unharmed			2
