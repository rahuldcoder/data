this week , the world 's largest gathering of @entity3 doctors and experts is converging on @entity5 for the 19th @entity6			1
it marks the first time in 22 years that the biannual event will be held on @entity11 soil , possible only because a 25 - year - old travel ban preventing hiv - positive people from entering the country was lifted by president @entity15 in 2009 and went into effect a year later			1
the significance of that move is not lost on researchers all over the country			1
more than 25,000 doctors , scientists , @entity3 activists , politicians , philanthropists , drug company representatives , people living with @entity28 and heads of state from around the world are attending the weeklong conference			1
there 's a lot going on : research on how to prevent @entity28 infection , treatment as prevention and , for the first time in a long time , talk about a " cure			1
" in fact , one of the main themes is the launch of " towards an @entity44 " : a global scientific strategy by an international working group of 300 researchers who are developing a road map of sorts , outlining priorities for finding a cure for the disease that has claimed approximately 30 million lives worldwide			1
timeline : 30 years of @entity3 -- moments to remember their goal : figuring out why the virus lives indefinitely in certain cells , which tissues it lives in , how to get the immune system to kill it and what kind of drugs can get rid of it			1
" we are trying to both inspire people about the possibility that this might happen someday but trying to be realistic , and the realistic part is that we have to do some fundamental basic science first , " said dr. @entity64 of the @entity65 at the @entity66			2
" most reasonable people would say it 's at best 50 - 50 that we 're gon na get a cure , so we do n't want to over-hype this			1
we 're excited , we think it 's possible , we think it 's worth pursuing , but do n't expect anything in the near future			2
" gay , bisexual men at high risk for @entity28 one man in particular , @entity84 , has pushed the limits of possibility			2
he 's known as the @entity89 patient , the only person said to have been " cured " of hiv / aids			2
" i 've been tested everywhere possible , " said @entity84 , who now lives in @entity91			2
" my blood 's been tested by many , many agencies			2
i 've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find @entity28 in my colon , and they have n't been able to find any			2
" in 2007 , @entity84 , an @entity28 - positive @entity11 living in @entity89 , was battling leukemia and needed a bone marrow transplant			1
his doctor searched for a donor with a rare mutation that makes it resistant to @entity28			2
the transplant not only cured his cancer , it appears to have cured his @entity28 , because the virus is no longer detectable			2
but @entity84 's case is rare			0
the procedure is extremely dangerous because a patient 's immune system has to be wiped out in order to accept the bone marrow transplant			0
using a bone marrow transplants to treat @entity28 is not a feasible treatment for most patients ; only 1 % of @entity117 -- mostly @entity119 @entity118 -- and no african - americans or @entity120 have this particular mutation , researchers say			1
quilt displays an @entity11 tragedy last month , five years after @entity126 was " cured , " reports surfaced that traces of the virus had been found in his blood			1
@entity64 says that does n't matter			0
" clinically , he has been cured			0
he stopped his drugs five years ago , his hiv tests are turning negative , we can not find with standard measurements or even really super-sensitive measurements any virus anywhere , so from a clinical perspective , he is cured , " @entity64 said			1
" there 's an academic debate as to whether every single virus is gone , but from @entity84 's perspective , he should n't care			0
" dr. @entity144 , head of the @entity145 , is one of the foremost experts on @entity28 and @entity3 and believes that @entity84 's case is a " proof of concept " that the battle against the disease can advance beyond daily drug cocktails			0
@entity64 leads the global collaboration with dr. @entity153 of the @entity154 in @entity155 , who was awarded the @entity157 in medicine for the discovery of @entity28 , along with her colleague @entity160			1
she says that by working together , they can get the job done faster			0
" what we are sure is that we think it 's reasonable today to say it 's feasible to have a cure			1
i believe that if we work like in the early years of @entity28 , all together , we can move forward very fast as well for an @entity28 cure			1
" but what will a cure look like ? there are two schools of thought			1
with a " functional " cure , the virus is controlled , and transmission would not occur			1
a " sterilizing " cure would eliminate the virus from the body entirely			1
on wednesday , dr. @entity182 , an @entity3 researcher at the @entity183 , @entity183 , is presenting results on a small study of eight patients treated with @entity187			0
it is used to treat lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph nodes and bloodstream			0
" we just have to start doing these studies and trying to make progress , and i think the big change in the last few years is that you can talk about it now , and we can start to work on it seriously rather than doing the scientific work surreptitiously but not using the ' cure ' word because everybody thought that was irresponsible or ridiculous			1
" @entity182 says everything is on the table to try			0
" the assumption is , it 's going to be complicated and difficult and involve multiple approaches , not ' take a pill and we 're done			0
' " @entity211 researchers are studying 12 hiv - positive people called the @entity214 patients			1
according to @entity153 , they were treated immediately after being exposed to @entity28 and have been able to control their virus naturally			0
promising results from that study will also be presented			0
" these patients have been treated very early on by the classical antiretroviral treatment during the acute phase of infections			0
they stopped their treatment , and now they are naturally able to control their infections with treatment anymore			0
they remain @entity28 - positive but they do n't transmit to others , so it 's also prevention			0
" researchers also hope to learn some important lessons from a group of infected men and women called elite controllers			1
" they do not irradiate their virus , " @entity153 said			0
" but they are capable to naturally control their infection because they never receive any antiretroviral treatment			0
they have an undetectable viral load			0
" while small trials like these aim to find a cure , efforts to prevent infection have also made great strides			1
last year , multiple studies showed that transmission of the virus can be reduced significantly -- up to 96 % -- by giving antiretroviral drugs to the uninfected partners of people with the disease			0
it 's called @entity259 , or pre-exposure prophylaxis			0
@entity261 approves @entity262 for prevention of hiv / aids for @entity153 , all the pieces of the puzzle are important to future success , and she is hopeful of a cure in her lifetime			2
@entity84 , who believes that he is cured , is banking on it			0
" it means that this is a case in point that the disease can be cured			0
i do n't wish what i went through on my worst enemy , but i 'm hoping that it can be done in a more simple way , that can be translated to a cure for the entire world , all people that have @entity28			2

the 19th @entity6 is in @entity5 this week
this is the first time in 22 years that the conference has been in the @entity11
global researchers are developing priorities for finding a cure
