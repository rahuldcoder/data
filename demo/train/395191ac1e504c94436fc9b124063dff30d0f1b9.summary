-- @entity1 is fervently preparing for its most ambitious venture yet : the launch of a new mobile application that the company hopes will change when and how society chooses to eat , shop and play			1
the application , known as @entity9 , is remarkably and elegantly simple , yet it 's a radical departure from @entity1 's current deal - a - day business model			2
when a user opens up the smartphone app , he or she will be presented with just two buttons : " i 'm hungry " and " i 'm bored			1
" clicking either button will open up a list of time - specific daily deals , based on his or her location			1
the familiar $ 10 coupons for $ 20 worth of food are still there , but they 're not one - time offers			0
instead , businesses can choose when they want these deals to be available			0
say a restaurant is incredibly busy on saturdays but could use more business on wednesdays			0
with @entity9 , that business can fill its seats during slow business days using time - specific deals			1
that 's the beauty of @entity9 : local businesses have never really had a simple way to manage their perishable inventory , especially labor and food			0
why waste those resources during slow periods when you can bring savings - savvy consumers through the doors with a highly targeted @entity1 deal ? " for merchants , the daily deal is like teeth whitening , and @entity9 is like brushing your teeth			1
it can be an everyday thing to keep your business going , " @entity1 founder and ceo @entity50 told @entity52 in an extensive interview on the new product			0
the daily deals company has been on a tear recently -- in fact it is the fastest growing company in history -- but it faces stiff competition from companies with increasing muscle			2
@entity1 is reportedly preparing for a $ 25 billion ipo just months after famously rejecting a $ 6 billion acquisition offer from @entity67 , but its biggest competitor , @entity68 , is preparing to raise half a billion dollars in funding			2
not only that , but the # 2 daily deals service has an app similar to @entity9 already on the market			1
@entity1 clearly believes @entity9 is the future , so much so that its employees call the current iteration of its daily deals service " @entity1			1
" while the market has made it clear that the group - buying business model is easily replicable , the coupon giant believes that its new offering will provide it with a unique technology and value proposition that will keep it ahead of the pack			0
with 70 + million subscribers and growing , @entity1 will also have a big head start			0
it wo n't be long until we find out if @entity9 is the future of local commerce ; the mobile app launches in april			0
