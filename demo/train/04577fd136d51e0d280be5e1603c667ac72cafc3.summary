@entity11 says doctors have responsibility for welfare of children conceived through @entity17 procedure			1
@entity5 , @entity6 ( @entity18 ) -- the birth of octuplets to a @entity22 woman last week raised a boatload of issues that can distract us from the central ethical question posed by the case : how do we take children 's well - being into account in reproductive medicine ? yes , it 's puzzling why an unemployed single woman who already had six children wanted a passel more			1
and it is not crazy to wonder who will pay for these children 's needs over the years , beginning with what is sure to be a gobsmacking bill for neonatal intensive care			1
for now , we can put aside the lifeboat problem : a human uterus is not built for eight passengers ; the odds for each child to be born alive and healthy go down as the number in the lifeboat goes up			0
her physicians offered to reduce the number of fetuses she was carrying ; citing her moral convictions , she declined			0
as of the last reports , all eight survived			0
still , knowing what we do about the many risks that come with being born too soon and too small , their medical course is likely to be complex and unsteady			0
what this case really does is split wide open a fault line running through infertility treatment in @entity66 medicine			1
people who show up at fertility clinics are adults			0
in the typical case , they 've been trying to get pregnant for a year or more without success			2
when all goes well , a cycle of @entity17 ( in - vitro fertilization ) results in a pregnancy and the birth of one , perhaps two , healthy babies			1
as a son , a father , and now a grandfather , i can attest that there is no more important or enduring relationship in our lives than the one between parents and children			1
whether that relationship is forged through infertility medicine , adoption or the old - fashioned way matters not at all : what counts is that adults who want to love and raise a child are matched with a child who needs just that love and care			0
the point of infertility treatment , after all , is to create a child			0
but that child - to - be is not the clinic 's patient -- the would - be parents are			1
i believe that the interests of those children deserve at least as much consideration as the wishes of the prospective parents			1
the vast majority of infertility patients are no doubt fierce advocates for the well - being of the child they so earnestly seek to bring into their lives			2
what happens , though , when the client 's request shows little consideration or regard for the welfare of the would - be children ? what happens if a woman in her early 30s with six children wants eight embryos implanted all at once ? a responsible physician could turn down such a request , citing professional guidelines that counsel implanting one , at most two , embryos in women younger than 35			1
how @entity133 ended up with eight is a mystery			0
that 's what @entity133 is claiming			2
perhaps there is a physician somewhere willing to defy the wisdom of his or her peers ; perhaps @entity133 used fertility drugs rather than @entity17 as she claimed			1
whatever the case , this guideline is based on safety			2
carrying more than a couple of fetuses is dangerous to the pregnant woman and to the health and survival of the fetuses in her womb			0
citing safety is a prudent way to turn down requests an infertility physician thinks are ill - considered			0
but sometimes that gambit is n't available			2
a psychiatrist friend who conducted intake interviews for a well - respected clinic described a rough - looking couple who carried for their up - front payment thousands of dollars in cash stuffed in a bag -- drug money , she was certain			0
she was able to discourage the couple from following through on their plan			0
here 's the rub : her concern was the ultimate well - being of the child that the clinic was being asked to help create			2
but the ideology of @entity66 infertility medicine allows physicians to escape from making any judgments about the suitability of prospective parents			2
there is understandable worry that cracking the door to considerations about parents ' motives and capacities would blast it wide open for nasty , petty stereotypes and prejudices			2
that would be an awful result			0
the @entity193 acknowledged in a 2004 report that fertility programs may withhold services when they can provide " well - substantiated judgments " that the child will not receive adequate care			0
but that same report has a huge loophole			0
providers can abdicate almost all responsibility to anticipate the welfare of the children they help create by claiming " an obligation to treat all patients who would benefit from medical treatment			1
" the statement goes on to say that " except when significant harm to a future child is likely , " they " should not be required to make assessments of a patient 's child - rearing abilities or other child welfare issues			1
" it 's time for the profession -- and business -- of reproductive medicine to accept their firm , inescapable ethical obligation to give the interests and well - being of the children they help to create the same consideration they give to the desires of the adults they serve			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity11 .			1

@entity11 : the case of the birth of octuplets in @entity22 raises questions
he says doctors typically cater to the wishes of their patients , the parents
in @entity17 cases , the doctors also have responsibility for children 's welfare , he says
he says doctors should n't use a loophole to evade their responsibility
