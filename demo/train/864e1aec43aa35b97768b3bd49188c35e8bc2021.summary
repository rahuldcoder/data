-- @entity1 has revealed that @entity4 motor marque @entity2 has a veto over who will succeed him as the boss of @entity8			1
the @entity10 billionaire has managed @entity8 's commercial rights since 1978 but there has recently been speculation over who could replace him as chief executive			1
@entity1 turned 83 this year and is defending lawsuits on both sides of the @entity19 surrounding the sale of @entity8 to private equity firm @entity21 in 2006			1
speaking before the season - ending @entity23 @entity22 in november , @entity1 told reporters for the first time who he would like to take over the reins			2
he said his " ideal " successor would be @entity29 , team principal of the @entity30 which has won the @entity8 championship for the past four years			1
" it needs someone who knows the sport			0
if someone comes in from outside , a corporate type , i do n't think i could work with them			0
it would n't last five minutes , " said @entity1			0
in a statement on @entity30 's official website on november 22 , @entity29 said while he was flattered by @entity1 's comments , he is " fully focused " on his role as team boss and has a long - term contract with the world champion team			1
@entity1 has since explained to @entity0 how @entity29 's name was linked with @entity8 's top job , saying : " somebody said to me , ' what happens when you go , what 's going to happen ? ' " @entity29 walked past and i said : ' what about him ? he is a good guy			1
' " firstly @entity21 would never agree and secondly @entity2 would have a say , " added @entity1			1
@entity1 revealed that @entity2 needs to give consent to his successor , a detail that is written in the prospectus for the stalled flotation of @entity8 on the @entity60 stock exchange			1
the prospectus states : " we must obtain the written consent of @entity2 prior to the appointment of any person as our chief executive officer if , within the past five years , he or she has held a senior executive office or an ownership interest of 5 % or more in any @entity70 or automobile manufacturer which either owns more than a 5 % interest in a team or is a supplier of engines to a @entity70			1
" @entity2 's president @entity76 also sits on @entity8 's nomination committee , whose responsibility is to " review and recommend candidates for appointments to the @entity82 ... " according to the prospectus			1
@entity84 recently commented on @entity4 's @entity86 television about @entity1 's anointment of @entity29 as his successor			2
the @entity4 commented : " @entity1 sees @entity29 as his successor ? as the years go by , he more and more enjoys making jokes and i 'm happy he still has the desire to do so			2
" a @entity2 spokesperson declined to give additional comment and told @entity0 : " it is premature at the moment to discuss this topic further			0
" @entity2 is the only team which has competed in @entity8 every year since the championship was launched in 1950			2
@entity98 , who won the @entity8 title for the @entity101 team in 1996 , says he believes that @entity2 's power is down to its longevity			2
" @entity2 has always been an exception in this sport and there may be good reason for that , " @entity98 told @entity0			0
" personally , i do n't see how you can have a free sport where one competitor has got a special status but there seems to be some sound marketing reason			0
teams that have had longer commitment to the sport have got a greater say in the sport and that is fair enough			0
" that is the power @entity2 has always had over the sport			0
" interactive : do you understand @entity8 's rule changes ? as @entity8 's controlling shareholder , @entity21 would also be closely involved with choosing @entity1 's successor			1
only 313 staff are employed by the @entity126 , the @entity127 - based company which runs the sport			0
the company has only 10 members of senior management , with no chief operating officer or deputy for @entity1			0
@entity133 , the former @entity134 chief executive of entertainment group @entity135 , was said to be a successor for @entity1 but left @entity8 just over a year after he was hired to run its corporate hospitality division in 2011			1
others who have been tipped to take over from @entity1 include @entity139 , who runs @entity10 supermarket chain @entity140 , and sir @entity141 , the former chief executive of its rival @entity143			2
but despite his advancing age and ongoing legal troubles , @entity1 says he has no intention of giving up the wheel , and told @entity0 : " i 'm not going anywhere			0
" blog : @entity151 -- arrogant or humble champion ?			0

@entity1 reveals @entity2 can veto his successor as @entity8 chief executive
@entity8 's controlling shareholder , private equity firm @entity21 , would also have a *significant* say
@entity1 this year named @entity30 team boss @entity29 as his possible replacement
but the 83 - year - old says he has no plans to stand down
