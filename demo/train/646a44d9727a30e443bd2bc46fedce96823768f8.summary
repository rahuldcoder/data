-- in the summer of 1985 , i lived a dual life			0
in my scholarly work , i argued that traditional gender roles -- the stay - at - home mother , the bread - winning father -- were recent cultural constructs			1
throughout human history , women engaged in productive labor alongside men			1
it was n't until the @entity14 that men began to work outside the home , tethering women to household responsibilities and child rearing			1
my thesis was that attitudes toward motherhood changed as the care of children became the exclusive responsibility of mothers			1
modern motherhood is a cultural invention , i argued , not biological destiny			1
opinion : benefit of office face time a myth when i was n't writing academic papers , i was caring for my baby daughter , working hard to be her primary attachment figure			1
when she cried out in the night , i wanted her to call for @entity37 , not daddy			0
i recognized my desire was based on my gender , and i appreciated the irony of this			0
nevertheless , i had internalized the values of my culture , and my own scholarship could not help me override this			0
i comforted myself that attitudes would change over time			1
after all , the women 's movement was still relatively young , and i was mothering during the height of the @entity49			1
sadly , very little has changed			1
why ? because the narrative in our culture is consistent and unyielding , reflected in the views of liberals and conservatives alike , omnipresent in our lives : raising children is mothers ' work , not parents ' work			0
when @entity63 , the ceo of @entity64 , banned employees from working from home , the media largely framed this as detrimental to women , not men			1
@entity71 's decision was portrayed as limiting work - life flexibility for mothers , who may need to be at home -- or prefer to be at home -- with their children			2
her decision was not sexist , but the coverage was			0
more than 40 years ago , psychologists @entity81 and @entity82 invented a simple test to determine whether a statement was sexist : could you exchange the word " women " for " men " and still have the sentence work ? try it with the most - read essay the @entity92 magazine has ever published , @entity94 's article , " why women still ca n't have it all			1
" in sentence after sentence , @entity94 's piece fails the test			2
in fact , the title fails			0
yet few have questioned why the piece was n't headlined " why parents ca n't have it all			2
" simplify your life : telecommuting is n't just for parents maternal employment continues to pose a threat to our strongly held belief about motherhood -- it is natural for mothers , not fathers , to have primary responsibility for raising children			1
by not challenging this recent cultural invention , we continue to lock young mothers into the same social binds that trapped me , even when i knew better			1
today , we are bombarded with the message that raising children is solely a mother 's job			2
when women are pregnant , people ask them , but not the fathers of their children , whether they plan to return to work			2
when couples shop for baby products , they discover packaging and advertisements featuring mothers with children , not fathers with children or couples with children			2
when they watch television programs , even " @entity145 , " they find stay - at - home mothers and employed fathers			0
or perhaps it is modern , and that 's the problem			1
the cost to women is great in lost opportunity			2
the cost to society is great in lost human capital			0
in the @entity157 , women comprise only 20 % of the @entity158 and 18 % of the @entity159			2
just 12 of the 50 largest school districts are led by women			2
there are only 21 women leading @entity165 companies , and according to a recent @entity168 survey , only 18 % of women managers want to be ceo , compared with 36 % of men			0
in this context , @entity171 , the coo of @entity172 , is " encouraging mothers with careers to opt out of the parent - or - career woman binary and firmly choose both			0
" by encouraging women to " lean in , " some , such as @entity94 , say @entity171 is placing undue burden on individual women			0
others argue that she is letting policymakers and cultural arbiters off the hook			0
people are focusing on the wrong issues			0
@entity171 is providing a powerful counter narrative of possibility that is all but missing in our culture			0
where does the solution lie ? i have spent much of my 31 - year career as a scholar arguing for family - friendly policies like quality child care , parental leave , and flexible work hours			1
but if we view these policy changes as supporting maternal -- rather than parental -- employment , then roadblocks for women will remain			1
we understand sexism when it 's explicit -- unequal pay for equal work -- but we have n't acknowledged gendered cultural biases surrounding parenthood			1
our implicit biases limit the aspirations of men and women alike			0
the solution lies in recognizing the problem			0
only then will we change our culture			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 believed modern motherhood is a cultural invention , not biological destiny
as a mom in ' *80s* , she was a primary *caretaker* , but thought cultural attitudes would change
she says nothing changed ; child care , flex time , baby leave are still considered women 's issues
@entity219 : workplace equality wo n't improve until these are considered " parental " concerns
