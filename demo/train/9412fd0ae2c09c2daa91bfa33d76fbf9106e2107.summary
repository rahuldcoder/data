crumpled , grubby bank notes could soon be on their way out in the @entity2 , according to the @entity3			1
by 2016 , the @entity2 will be switching its £ 5 and £ 10 bills to polymer bank notes as they 're more durable , harder to forge , and cheaper in the long run			1
for over 300 years the @entity3 has been printing bank notes , and despite the growth of credit and debit cards and online transactions , there 's more cash in circulation than ever before			1
the challenge is how to keep ahead of the counterfeiters , and this has prompted the @entity3 to follow recent technology in converting some of its notes			1
" the key part of a bank note is ' i promise to pay ' and people need to believe the bank will always promise to pay , but they also need to believe the notes they hold are genuine notes and not counterfeited notes , " explained @entity20 , chief cashier of the @entity3 , to @entity22 's @entity21 in an interview			2
the @entity2 will be one of just a handful of currencies produced this way			0
already , @entity35 and @entity36 have been moving away from paper to polymer in order to crack the counterfeiters and ensure the notes last longer			2
a key security feature of the polymer note is a window you can look through			0
another feature of the plastic note is that it 's quite thin and flexible , and still includes the raised print which people seem to prefer , said @entity50			0
" one of the advantages of polymer notes is that they will hold their shape a lot more and they 're more durable , " @entity50 explained to @entity51 , showing @entity22 the slick new , washing - machine proof notes being printed			2
while the process of converting traditional notes to a plastic form will be an expensive endeavor , the @entity3 believes a polymer note will last at least two and a half times longer than paper			1
the £ 5 note will get the first facelift in 2016 , followed by the £ 10 note			1
@entity67 will become the face on the £ 5 note , while @entity69 will grace the £ 10 note			1
a polymer note is more expensive to produce initially and there will be some transitional costs , but @entity50 said that over a 10 year period of switching the £ 5 and £ 10 notes , the @entity3 will save at least £ 100 million , a lot of it because of the increased longevity of the notes			1
and it 's not just @entity2 notes which are getting a makeover			0
the @entity82 has proposed a new design for the one pound coin , with @entity86 anti-counterfeiting technology embedded into the metal which they claim will make it the most secure coin in the world			0
the @entity82 has been casting coins for over eleven hundred years , producing coins and medals for up to 60 countries and supplying about 15 % of global demand			0
the £ 1 pound coin has been used for 30 years but has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters , with 45 million coins -- or 3 % of the coins in circulation -- now being forgeries			2
" the current electromagnetic signature in a coin can wear over time making forgeries harder to detect , " said @entity103 , director of circulating coin sales at the @entity82			0
the new £ 1 coin , which is set to be introduced in 2017 , will have the @entity109 -- integrated @entity110 -- which has been used in bank notes for 20 years			2
this will enable enhanced security throughout the cash cycle , said @entity115 , protecting the public , vending machine operators , retailers and the banking system			0
with all the talk of a cashless society , it seems that cash is here to stay , albeit in its new plastic format .			0

by 2016 , the @entity3 will be printing polymer £ 5 and £ 10 notes
the plastic notes will help fight counterfeiters and will be more durable
while the switch to polymer will be expensive , in the long - term it will save millions
