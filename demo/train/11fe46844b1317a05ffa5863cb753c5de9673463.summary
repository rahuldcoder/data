-- i know just what a lot of those so - called @entity3 deserve to get for @entity5 : a scolding			1
there are good and bad actors in every movement , and the bad ones -- if not kept in check -- can drag the good ones down with them			0
the term @entity3 refers to the estimated 1.4 million to 2 million young illegal immigrants who might have gotten some relief if the @entity3 , which offered legal status in return for attending college or joining the military , had n't been torpedoed in the @entity20 in december 2010			1
having declared their intention to better themselves , some in the @entity3 movement now insist that they 're entitled to better treatment than run - of - the - mill illegal immigrants			1
you know , like the hardworking and humble folks who cut your lawn , clean your house or care for your kids			1
in fact , the @entity3 seem to suggest they 're due a reward for good behavior			1
at times , these young people act like spoiled brats			1
they don caps and gowns and disrupt committee hearings and occupy the offices of members of @entity45			0
they dare police to arrest them , and then act surprised when it happens			0
they 're not realistic , or respectful			1
as we learned recently , the @entity3 have a whole wish list of what they want from @entity45 next year after what is expected to be a humdinger of an immigration debate			1
a few weeks ago , more than 500 of these young people -- and their supporters -- were brought together in @entity59 , @entity60			1
by a well - funded organization called " @entity62 , " which bills itself as the largest immigrant youth - led network in the country			1
at the @entity68 , attendees voted for a national platform that demands the following : -- " fair treatment for @entity3 and our families and communities , including a road map to citizenship for 11 million @entity75 without papers and an end to senseless deportations and abuses " ; -- " the ability to travel without fear , ensuring all immigrants have access to driver 's licenses and the ability to visit family in other countries " ; -- " the elimination of barriers to higher education for immigrant youth by extending state and federal financial aid opportunities , as well as in - state tuition rates to @entity3 available to our peers " ; -- " an end to excessive and costly immigration enforcement policies which separate families and divide communities , such as ' @entity102 , ' e-verify , @entity104 , and roadside checkpoints " ; -- " access to health care and safe , fair working conditions and equal protection under the law for all " ; and -- " growth and diversity of our movement for change , intensifying efforts to become more inclusive of non-latinos , lgbtq communities , differently abled people , people of faith , and other groups			1
" @entity124 , kids , can we get you anything else ? maybe free massages the next time you stage a sit - in ? these kids want it all			1
faces of hope line up for two more years in the @entity75 they demand more than just the ability to live in the @entity75 legally and not have to worry about being deported as many others have been			0
this is no small thing			0
the @entity137 administration removed more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants over the last four years , and there 's every indication it plans to remove just as many in a second term			1
some of those who have been deported were @entity3 , despite president @entity137 's claim that @entity144 is removing only hardened criminals			1
if you believe that , you 're probably also expecting a portly fellow in a red suit to come down the chimney on @entity150			2
last summer , @entity137 announced a deferred action program and offered to stop deporting @entity3			1
under the program , undocumented youth who are eligible apply for a two - year work permit			2
what happens after that , no one knows			0
the @entity3 chalked up a victory			1
but what some seem to really want is the golden ticket : @entity75 citizenship			2
and they want it yesterday			0
they 're convinced that they deserve it , and they 'll settle for nothing less			2
many of them reject , even ridicule , proposals by @entity175 in @entity45 to give them legal status without citizenship -- and the voting privileges that come with it			2
while they probably do n't realize it , their public tantrums are turning people against them and hurting the chances for a broader immigration reform package			2
and if they set back that cause , heaven help them			0
they 'll sink the progress for a group of people who have given more , worked harder and made greater sacrifices -- people like their undocumented parents			2
you know , the people who brought them to this country in the first place for a better life , and then fed them , clothed them and sheltered them			2
these are the folks who told the @entity3 they were special , long before that became the official position of the immigration reform movement			1
that does n't sit well with a lot of @entity75 -- especially @entity75 - born @entity207 who were raised to believe that , in this life , you get what you earn			2
according to polls , some 80 % of them support the @entity3			1
but , for a while now , i 've detected some discomfort with the @entity3 , particularly their tone and tactics			1
it comes from people like @entity218 , a @entity219 - @entity75 political strategist in @entity220 ( disclosure : he 's a friend and business partner ) who supports comprehensive immigration reform and has the credentials to prove it			1
more than 25 years ago , @entity218 was executive director of the @entity226 and helped shape the 1986 @entity227			0
today , a lot of folks on the left talk about creating a pathway to legal status for millions of the undocumented			0
this guy actually helped do it			0
@entity3 : deferred deportation for almost a year , i 've been listening to him grumble about the @entity3 and their goals			1
" it appears that the agenda was all about getting attention , believing that this would solve their issue " he said			0
" they seem to be saying , ' if you pay attention to me , i become powerful			0
so we may be undocumented , but we are powerful now			0
you 're denying us our dream			2
now we demand that you do this for us			0
' @entity252 is necessary , but demands are not			0
we want solutions , but not only for one segment of a much larger community in need			0
" @entity218 worries that the @entity3 could , through their hubris , alienate supporters and make it harder to win the backing of @entity175 for a larger immigration reform plan			1
a lot of @entity3 are drunk on entitlement			1
but why should this surprise us ? feeling entitled is the @entity75 way			2
and these kids are as @entity75 as they come			0
they may have been born in another country , but -- unlike their parents -- they were raised in this one			0
they bleed red , white and blue , use @entity271 as their primary language and tweet up a storm before breakfast			0
and in a country whose motto has gone from " @entity279 " to " gim me , gim me			0
where 's mine ? , " they 're not about to be left behind			1
dream'ers were n't born ; they were created			0
not long ago , the conventional wisdom in @entity285 was that immigration reform was n't going to happen soon			2
so forget women and children			0
no wonder these kids think they 're special			2
undocumented students in their own words there 's only one problem			2
these people are still in the @entity75 illegally			0
they do n't like being reminded of this , but it 's true			0
so they 'd be wise to tread lightly -- especially since they do n't have the leverage they once did			1
these kids are just not that special anymore			0
that is , except to themselves			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity309 .			1

@entity309 : dreamers behaving as entitled brats ruining immigration bids for others
he says one @entity3 group has national platform demanding citizenship , health care , college
he says they 're self - absorbed while hardworking immigrants who brought them here wait
@entity309 : they are drunk on entitlement and it 's getting old ; they should tread more lightly
