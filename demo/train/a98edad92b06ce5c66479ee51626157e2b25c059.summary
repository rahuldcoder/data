outside the court she will always try to help you when she can			0
she 's like a sister to me			2

the @entity67 edged a grueling match with @entity69 , of @entity70 , to win 4 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 4			0
" it was disappointing to lose that first set after i had been up ; i 'm happy i turned it around , " @entity65 said			0
" in the third set i was down 2 - 0 and it could have been 3 - 0 , and all of a sudden it was n't looking good , but i kept fighting and every game was close , and i 'm happy i ended up winning it			2
" at the open 13 tournament in @entity81 , @entity82 , the no. 2 seed from @entity83 , moved into the last eight after beating @entity70 's @entity85 3 - 6 7 - 6 7 - 5			1
