-- we know that @entity3 's hips do n't lie , but do they corrupt ? that 's the argument of one politician in her native @entity6 who wants to ban the superstar 's latest music video for its " immoral and vulgar " content			1
the offending video is for @entity3 's new single " @entity14 , " a racy production that features @entity13			1
@entity3 does her trademark hip - shaking and gyrating in the video , but also shares scenes in bed with @entity13 and smoking cigars			1
@entity21 councilman @entity20 said the video should be banned from @entity6 airwaves because the smoking and the touching in bed violate a law that prohibits broadcast material that damages the " moral integrity " of children			1
" i found a video that evidently contains images that in my opinion are not useful for the emotional growth and development of youths , " @entity20 told @entity0 en @entity32 on wednesday			2
the councilman wrote a letter to @entity3 , appealing to her role as a mother and asking her to remove the video from the @entity43 and to consider retracting the song altogether			0
" i feel it promotes immorality , " he told @entity0 en @entity45			0
@entity20 took his campaign to social media , distributing a flier on @entity50 and @entity51 that warns that the video promotes smoking and lesbianism			0
( in his letter to the singer , @entity20 explains that he believes that a " normal " family is comprised of a man and a woman and children )			2
his comments were met with critics who accused him of censorship , but others supported his stance , saying the video goes too far			0
" i think the message that @entity3 is sending to the youth and children around the world is a message that sells a lifestyle and promotes a particular orientation , that in my opinion , does not reflect the views of most @entity6 , " @entity20 said			1
in @entity6 , @entity3 is more than a music star			2
she is an important advocate and philanthropist who has a foundation to help impoverished children in @entity6 and has been a @entity79 goodwill ambassador			0
@entity20 calls himself a fan of @entity3 , and argues that precisely because of her talent and fame , she does n't need sex to sell her albums			2
she has a social responsibility , @entity20 said , to not repeat stereotypes of women in music			0
asked if he would back the ban of dozens of other artists who depict sex , smoking or drinking in their music or videos , @entity20 said @entity3 's case is different because so many children look up to her			1
@entity3 has not responded to @entity0 requests for response to the politician 's claims .			0

@entity3 's new music video featuring @entity13 is racy
too racy for children in @entity6 , a politician there says
@entity20 wants the singer to pull the video
he has found *detractors* and some supporters *online*
