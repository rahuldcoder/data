@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 on thursday brushed off widespread criticism that the december 4 parliamentary elections in @entity3 were falsified			1
he said their results " reflect the actual line - up of forces in the country , as well as the fact that the ruling force -- the @entity12 party -- has lost certain positions			2
" in his traditional year - end question - and - answer program , televised live by state media , he said there is nothing new in the fact that the opposition is not happy with the election outcome			1
" that happens every time and will be happening in the future			0
the opposition always struggles and takes every opportunity to sideline the authorities , to blame them and to highlight their mistakes			0
it is a totally normal thing			0
" speaking of large - scale protests that took place last saturday in @entity0 and many other cities across the country , @entity2 said he is glad that many young and active people were participating in them			1
" if this is the result of ' @entity38 ' that people now have a chance to express their point of view , it is normal , " he said , " as long as all those actions are within the law			1
" he said there were established procedures in place for resolving disputes , including through the courts			0
" we should proceed from the assumption that our courts will act fast and be objective , " he said			0
@entity2 suggested the opposition 's criticism of the vote has a far - reaching goal -- that of aiming to undermine confidence in the upcoming presidential election in which he is running			1
" it is obvious to me that the attacks on the latest election are secondary ; their primary goal is the next election , the @entity3 presidential election , " @entity2 said			1
" it is necessary to minimize the possibility of claims that this or future elections may be unfair in order to cut the ground under the feet of those wishing to de-legitimatize the national authorities			2
" the @entity3 opposition is not alone in voicing concern over the conduct of the election , however			1
the @entity79 said in a preliminary report that some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was " slanted in favor of the ruling party			0
" its election - observer mission detailed alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes , manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors			2
secretary of state @entity90 also said the @entity91 had " serious concerns " about the election and called for a " full investigation " of apparent irregularities			0
looking ahead , @entity2 said the opposition must have the opportunity to control everything that is going on at polling stations , and he proposed that live web cameras be installed at all voting stations across the country in the presidential elections next march			1
" i am proposing to the @entity105 to install live web cameras at every polling station across the country -- at more than 90,000 of them -- and let those cameras work round - the - clock , day and night , to take in on to the internet so that the entire country could see what is going on at every polling box -- to completely remove all concerns about falsifications , " the prime minister said			1
tens of thousands turned out saturday to protest against election results that returned @entity2 's @entity12 party to power but with a smaller majority			2
police estimated crowds in @entity0 at 25,000 , while organizers said the total was 40,000 , the state - run @entity123 news agency reported			0
either figure would make the protests the largest in the @entity3 capital in 20 years			1
claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged , protesters chanted " @entity2 out			1
" they also braved freezing temperatures in other @entity3 cities to demonstrate against what they said was vote fraud			2
another protest is scheduled for december 24 -- three days after the new parliament is due to hold its first session , under a decree signed tuesday			0
@entity2 said that such public protests and discontent should not undermine @entity3 's political system			1
" we have qualitatively new tasks for the medium - term and longer , strategic prospect			0
we will need to re-configure society , strengthen the political system and broaden the foundation of democratic institutions			0
naturally , we need to modernize every sphere of life , " he said			0
@entity2 promised that if he is elected president , he will work and maintain contact with all political forces in the country , including the opposition , " although it 's often useless or impossible			2
