another tense standoff developed monday night in @entity1 , @entity2 , which has seen nightly protests since unarmed 18 - year - old @entity4 was shot to death by a white police officer			1
the renewed tensions came after the preliminary results of an autopsy that @entity4 's family requested were released , as was a new account of what allegedly happened in the moments immediately before the teenager was killed by a local police officer			1
evidence in the shooting death could be presented to a grand jury as early as wednesday			0
and as the situation in the @entity22 suburb was being watched and talked about across the country , it continued to draw comments from numerous quarters -- including the @entity26			1
" we have all seen images of protesters and law enforcement in the streets			0
it 's clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting			0
what 's also clear is that a small minority of individuals are not , " said president @entity35			0
" while i understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of @entity4 , giving into that anger by looting , or carrying guns , and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos , " he said , in a call for calm			1
" let 's see some understanding " rather than confrontation , and " let 's seek to heal , " the president said			0
the protests in @entity1 also prompted gov. @entity55 to call out the @entity56			0
officials temporarily detained several people , including news photographer @entity59 and longtime activist and @entity62 survivor @entity61			0
dueling narratives the officer who killed @entity4 says the teenager rushed at him full speed in the moments before the shooting , according to an account phoned in to a @entity22 radio station and confirmed by a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation			1
according to the version on @entity75 , phoned in by a woman who identified herself as " @entity77 , " the altercation on august 9 began after officer @entity79 rolled down his window to tell @entity4 and a friend to stop walking in the street			1
when @entity79 tried to get out of his cruiser , @entity4 first tried to push the officer back into the car , then punched him in the face and grabbed for his gun before breaking free after the gun went off once , the caller said			1
@entity79 pursued @entity4 and his friend , ordering them to freeze , according to the account			1
when they turned around , @entity4 began taunting @entity79 , saying he would not arrest them , then ran at the officer at full speed , the caller said			1
the final shot was to @entity4 's forehead , and the teenager fell two or three feet in front of @entity79 , said the caller , who identified herself as the officer 's friend			1
a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation later told @entity108 the caller 's account is " accurate , " in that it matches what @entity79 has told investigators			1
but accounts of exactly what happened when @entity79 stopped @entity4 vary widely			2
witnesses said they saw a scuffle between the officer and @entity4 at the police car before the young man was shot			1
several witnesses said @entity4 raised his hands and was not attacking the officer			1
@entity123 said she was sitting in her home when she witnessed the shooting			0
she captured video of the aftermath , including images of @entity4 's body lying in the middle of the street			2
@entity123 said @entity4 was running away from police and then turned around			2
she said that was when @entity4 was shot			1
police provided a different narrative , saying @entity4 struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon			1
parallel investigations a grand jury will hear testimony from witnesses and decide on whether to return an indictment in the case , @entity139 , spokesman for the @entity141 prosecuting attorney , said monday , stressing there is " no time line on this case			0
" in addition to that proceeding , the @entity150 has opened a civil rights investigation into @entity4 's death			1
attorney general @entity155 will travel to @entity1 this week , to meet with investigators there			0
" i realize there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to @entity4 's death , but i ask for the public 's patience as we conduct this investigation , " the attorney general said in a statement			1
" the selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me			0
no matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries , the @entity150 is resolved to preserve the integrity of its investigation			2
" autopsy findings an autopsy conducted for the family of @entity4 found no evidence that he struggled with @entity79 before his death , according to the pathologist in charge of the examination			1
dr. @entity184 conducted the autopsy after an official examination by the @entity141 medical examiner 's office			2
forensics consultant @entity189 , who assisted @entity184 , said the findings are consistent with witness reports that @entity4 may have been shot as he walked away and that he was shot again with his hands up			1
the family autopsy found that @entity4 was shot at least six times , including two shots to his head			1
three of the bullets may have re-entered his body , causing additional damage , @entity184 said			0
one of the bullets entered his head and came out through his eye ; another -- likely the fatal wound , @entity184 said -- struck @entity4 on the top of his head and caused irreparable damage to his brain			1
family attorney @entity207 said @entity4 probably would have been either kneeling or bending forward when he was struck with those bullets			1
@entity4 had abrasions on his face consistent with falling onto the ground , @entity184 said			2
he cautioned that he needs access to autopsy results , including tests on @entity4 's clothes and x-rays , before making some conclusions			1
but @entity207 said the autopsy already offered more than " ample " evidence to support @entity79 's arrest			2
" what does this autopsy say ? that the witness accounts were true , that he was shot multiple times , " @entity207 told reporters			2
attorney general @entity155 said a third autopsy was being conducted monday by medical examiners from the @entity231 military			2
@entity4 death : autopsy unlikely to settle dueling narratives devolution of protests another family attorney , @entity236 , implored protesters to remain peaceful			1
" i can see that there is a very disturbing divide that is developing in our community , " he said monday			0
" this is not what we initially came to the community and called for			2
" the situation remains so unstable that the @entity247 has canceled classes for the rest of the week			0
the @entity250 was in @entity1 under orders from the governor to restore peace			0
@entity55 issued the order early monday after what began as peaceful protests spiraled into disarray after two civilians were shot and injured , @entity255 capt. @entity254 said			0
he said those civilians were not shot by police			0
some protesters hurled @entity265 cocktails at police , and several businesses were vandalized or looted despite the @entity4 family 's call for calm			2
" based on these conditions , i had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response , " @entity254 said			0

two children were treated and released for exposure to tear gas overnight at @entity285 , according to a spokeswoman there			0
protester @entity288 challenged the notion that protesters provoked officers			0
" that is a lie			0
it was no fight , it was no shots fired , " she told @entity108 late sunday			0
