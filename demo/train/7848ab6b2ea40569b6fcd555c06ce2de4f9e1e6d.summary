-- this past week , at " town hall " meetings in @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , a group of @entity3 senators sounded alarms about disasters that will befall local economies should the threat of more than $ 500 billion in defense cuts over the next decade become a reality in january			1
to his credit , the group 's leader , sen. @entity16 of @entity18 , admitted that @entity20 should take some of the blame for creating this situation			1
but that was a rare recognition of reality at town halls that were more like a @entity3 version of the mythical potemkin villages : fake towns hastily put together by @entity30 minister @entity29 to impress the visiting empress			1
the real purpose of the @entity3 's @entity34 town halls ? to redefine @entity20 ' unfinished task of deficit reduction as an @entity38 administration leadership failure that has put both national security and swing - state jobs at risk by playing games with defense spending			1
the road to these town halls began in @entity46 a year ago with a congressional vote that was needed to raise the debt ceiling and avoid @entity50 default on a debt that has skyrocketed since 2000			0
@entity52 , shackled by a @entity54 ball - and - chain , turned the vote into a heated debate on spending cuts			2
the ensuing legislative battle led not to meaningful deficit reduction but to the @entity60			0
it 's an 11th - hour " @entity63 " legislation that raised the debt ceiling -- and kicked the deficit can down the road by one year			0
the @entity60 mandated $ 917 billion in federal spending cuts over a 10 - year period , including some $ 487 billion in defense cuts			1
but that was n't all			2
the centerpiece was a different kind of act : a high - wire act called " sequestration			2
" sequestration is a trigger			2
it 's scheduled to be pulled in early january -- unleashing $ 1.2 trillion in additional cuts , half in defense , half in other domestic spending , unless @entity20 agrees on an alternate plan			1
almost no @entity85 or @entity3 wants to make these sequestration cuts because they will have significant and negative consequences for national security and for domestic spending , affecting millions of @entity50			1
in fact , almost no one who voted for this legislation ever thought these cuts would actually be made			2
the @entity60 was intended to provide breathing space and to buy time			0
sequestration was added to force a congressional " supercommittee " to come up with a deficit deal late last year , " or else			2
" but the supercommittee was as divided as the @entity20 that created it ; @entity20 could n't come up with a solution , and it was no real surprise that the supercommittee could n't either			1
@entity16 and his swing - state town hall team were right in framing the consequences : if the trigger is pulled , sequestration will have immediate and negative impact on millions of @entity50			2
this includes not just @entity50 troops , defense industry civilians and local bases			0
it also includes schools and @entity118 participants , struggling families for whom child care support is critical , unemployed workers who need job training programs -- all would lose out in the nondefense portion of sequestration			0
but the senators were disingenuous in exhorting their audiences to " demand presidential leadership " to avoid falling off the fiscal cliff in january -- and wrong to imply that the president has been awol on the issue , leaving national security and jobs at risk			0
president @entity38 has made clear he does n't want to see these cuts happen next year			1
defense secretary @entity133 has repeatedly declared that sequestration defense cuts -- coming on top of the 10 - year , $ 487 billion in defense cuts that start next year -- would have disastrous consequences for our national security			1
@entity38 has been at the table since last summer trying to prevent this by reaching a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction			1
he laid out a detailed plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 4 trillion over the next decade -- a plan that would bring annual domestic spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy since president @entity150 and would require less in defense cuts than recommended by the bipartisan @entity152			1
but the president calls for a balanced approach that includes spending cuts and investment revenue			0
his proposed spending cuts outweigh the proposed additional revenue by more than double			0
but it 's the investment revenue which has been the deal - breaker for most republicans			0
in fact , that 's the major reason that sequestration includes the $ 500 billion in defense spending cuts : faced with their own @entity167 of putting at risk either the defense budget or continued tax breaks for the wealthy , @entity166 grimaced -- and threw defense into the cauldron to protect the tax breaks			1
it seems clear that the political brinksmanship will continue until @entity3 and @entity176 in @entity20 figure out how to do what military and civilian leaders at the @entity179 had to do this past year in addressing the initial $ 487 billion in defense cuts : namely , tie spending to the national interest and do so recognizing " we 're all in this together			1
" @entity38 ordered the @entity179 to devise a plan ensuring that national security priorities would guide and frame spending decisions , rather than the other way around ; and ensuring that the @entity50 military would remain the strongest and best in the world to protect and defend @entity50 national interests			1
the generals , admirals and civilian leaders did just that			0
all had a stake in the outcome and recognized the world had changed			0
all were involved throughout in shaping the plan			0
all recognized that pet projects and sacred cows had to meet the tests of commonly defined national security priorities or be reduced or jettisoned			0
all understood that to succeed in keeping the country safe and secure , they needed not just to cut in some areas but to invest in others , and that having the best and strongest military in the world was not really synonymous with continuing to spend unlimited billions			0
all made difficult individual decisions in the belief that they were all in this together , and they have spoken publicly and privately in support of the strategic framework they developed to guide defense spending decisions over the next decade			0
maybe instead of holding political @entity29 town halls in swing states about the dangers that sequestration poses for the @entity179 , we should ask congressional leaders to take lessons from the @entity179 on how to work together to prevent it from happening			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

@entity228 : @entity3 *distorting* reality behind @entity179 cuts that could be triggered in january
" sequestration " will start $ 1.2 trillion in cuts , with half of that in defense
@entity228 : @entity3 blames *looming* disaster on @entity38 , but it was a *delaying* *tactic* by @entity20
@entity38 does n't want these *harmful* sequestration cuts and has alternative plans , he says
