@entity13 , @entity14 : i 'm @entity16 and you 're watching @entity19 student news ! today 's headlines , no commercials			1
bringing you stories from all over the @entity23 today , and we start things off in @entity4			1
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : that 's where authorities are trying to put out a wildfire that 's been burning for a couple days now			1
the state 's governor has declared a state of emergency			1
the fire is near the city of @entity37			2
around 3,500 people were told to leave their homes , and school was canceled in the area			1
as of yesterday afternoon , there had n't been any reports of injuries			2
planes , like the one you see here , are dropping fire retardant , chemicals that are used to try to put out the fires			2
the planes can only fly in certain conditions , though , so if the weather gets bad or the wind picks up , that can be problematic			2
officials say that more equipment and more firefighters are heading to the area to help out with the efforts there			1
@entity61 @entity27 : these images were taken in @entity5 on monday night			2
they give you an idea of the conditions caused by @entity61			2
this storm made landfall near @entity69			2
it got weaker as it moved across the state , but @entity72 still dumped huge amounts of rain on parts of @entity5			1
forecasters expected some areas to get up to 10 inches of rain			2
and in the southern part of the state , @entity72 threatened what are called " storm surges			2
" those can raise water levels ; in this case , maybe as much as 3 feet			2
just the facts @entity87 , @entity14 : just the facts			2
the @entity89 is the holy book of the @entity91 religion			0
its name comes from an @entity94 term that means " the recitation			0
" the quran is made up of 114 chapters , which are divided into different verses			1
it includes specific laws and rules for @entity91 society , as well as guidance for @entity104 about their daily lives			0
@entity106 @entity27 : the @entity89 is a big part of a protest that 's scheduled for this saturday			1
the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity108 is planning to burn @entity111			0
@entity112 , the church 's pastor , says the protest is aimed at @entity91 extremists , not at all @entity104			1
and he acknowledges that it 'll make some people upset			0
@entity112 , church pastor , dove world outreach : we feel that the message that we are trying to send is much more important than people being offended			0
we believe that we can not back off of the truth of the dangers of @entity91 , of the dangers of radical @entity91 just because people are going to be offended			0
@entity27 : a lot of people are criticizing this idea to burn @entity111			0
that includes other religious leaders			0
some of them came together in @entity132 yesterday to speak out against the plan			0
@entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 : religious leaders denounce @entity141 bigotry and call for respect for @entity23 's tradition of religious liberty			1
as religious leaders in this great country , we have come together in our nation 's capital to denounce categorically the derision , misinformation and outright bigotry being directed against @entity23 's @entity104 community			1
@entity27 : another group that 's spoken out against this is the @entity23 military			1
in a statement , general @entity157 -- he 's the @entity23 commander in @entity159 -- said burning @entity164 " could endanger troops and it could endanger the overall effort in @entity159			1
" @entity165 @entity27 : well , there are always interesting comments on this , not only from the people involved in the story , but from you			0
we 've put up a post on our blog at @entity175 where you can talk this story , you can talk about how you feel about it			0
this day in history @entity180 : september 8 , 1504 -- @entity182 's " @entity157 " statue is unveiled in @entity183 , @entity184 september 8 , 1565 -- @entity185 , @entity108 , the oldest city in the @entity23 , is established september 8 , 1900 -- a category 4 hurricane hits @entity187 , @entity5 , killing more than 8,000 people september 8 , 1974 -- president @entity189 pardons former president @entity190 for any crimes he may have committed while in office september 8 , 1998 -- @entity193 breaks @entity195 ' record for the most home runs in a single season is this legit ? @entity198 , @entity14 : is this legit ? worldwide , one out of every 10 adults is illiterate			1
it 's actually twice that many -- one out of every five adults -- who ca n't read or write			1
@entity203 @entity27 : some surprising numbers , and those are part of the reason why the @entity207 created @entity203			0
it 's designed to raise awareness about literacy needs around the world			1
the theme of this year 's event is " literacy and women 's empowerment			1
" according to the @entity207 , two - thirds of the world 's illiterate adults are women			1
the organization says that literacy is a basic human right because it 's the main tool for learning			1
ceo principal @entity27 : sticking with the education theme , different teachers have different teaching methods			1
you know that ; you 're aware of it ; you see it all the time			0
in @entity6 , one principal is running his school like a business			1
and based on his students ' test scores , it 's working			1
@entity239 shows us how he 's making the grade			1
( begin video ) @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 : the school day begins at @entity248 with drills ; math drills , as fast as these kids can do them			1
the theory here : train the brain with drills , much in the same way puzzles may prevent dementia among the elderly			0
principal @entity260 believes it so much , he joins the students			1
school curriculum is the basics , plus lessons from real - world business and community leaders to show kids where the basics will take them			1
@entity272 for a @entity6 school system known for rigidity and formality			1
but @entity260 is not your average principal			1
he 's not even a trained educator			1
he 's a businessman who started and then ran publishing at high - tech companies			1
his lack of experience in this setting is what led the school to recruit him			1
" principals are people who became teachers right after graduating from college , " says @entity260			0
" that limits any outside the box thinking , " he explains			0
he runs the school more like a corporation ; students , his workers			1
and he keeps track of them			0
you know all the names of all the students			1
@entity299 , @entity301 junior high : no only name , but also their testing score			0
@entity305 : you know their test scores and their names ? @entity310 : yes , yes , yes			0
@entity305 : every single one			0
@entity310 : all of them			0
@entity305 " he 's different , " says a student			1
" more like a friend sometimes , but still the boss			0
" in the three years since @entity260 has been principal , the school claims higher test scores			1
the result , he believes , of a number of innovations			0
it 's 6:40 in the evening and students are still here at @entity324			1
the reason why : night school is about to begin			1
this is an unusual move by this public school to try to boost its test scores			1
it 's where i meet 15 - year - old @entity333			2
" we start at 7:00 p.m. , " @entity333 explains			0
he 's been in school since 8:00 in the morning and leaves at 9:30 at night			1
critics call this too tough for a public school , but @entity260 says the old must give way to new thinking			2
and other educators in the country are taking note			0
the bottom line , says this former businessman , if @entity6 's corporations must adapt and compete in a global economy , it only makes sense that , so too , must @entity6 's schools			1
@entity239 , @entity19 , @entity246			0
( @entity351 ) off the @entity352 @entity27 : well , it is time for our first field trip of the school year : off the @entity352			2
turns out , people had a lot of time on their hands over the long @entity361			0
( begin video ) @entity27 : honestly , who does n't dream of being a champion arm wrestler ? okay , do n't answer that			0
just arm yourself for a battle of the biceps ! at @entity371 's @entity370 , it 's about technique			2
for some , it 's all in the wrist			2
for some , it 's in speed			2
and for some , it 's in the face			2
would you wan na hold hands with this guy ? @entity382 : when they mean redneck festival , they mean redneck festival			0
@entity27 : but we 're not still talking about arm wrestling			0
we 're talking about this : @entity391 's annual @entity390 ! you can ride the bull or barrel			2
you can shop for jewelry or aluminum			0
@entity397 : they sell like hotcakes			0
@entity27 : but if a " haybale obstacle course " is n't your speed , saddle up for a one - wheeled whirl across the @entity403 ! when you 're too coordinated for two wheels , you do n't just want to boast balance ; you want to show stunts			0
this person had a " can - do " attitude			0
at least people would hear it if he fell			0
it 's easy to see how all this pedal - spinning can make your head spin			2
so without a wheel , why not just turn yourself around at a @entity415 ? to get this many people over age 8 to participate , you must be trying to set a record			0
and they did : a @entity420			0
more than 7,300 hokey pokers putting their hands into history			0
that 's what it 's all about when you journey @entity428			2
( @entity351 ) goodbye @entity27 : a world record is always cool , even if group dances are a little hokey			0
and those unicycle guys are wheelie awesome			0
time for us to brake for the day ; i know it breaks your heart			0
talk to you then !			0
