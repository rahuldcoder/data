@entity0 -- the most complicated neighborhood in the world is even more uncertain these days , and what you see ranges from breathtaking to heart - stopping			1
in @entity8 , @entity9 , there are fancier cars and more economic activity than when i last visited five years ago			1
that is n't the only big change : in the early days of the @entity18 presidency the new @entity16 president inspired hope across the @entity21 world			1
now , there are posters and protests critical of the president , and some harsh words from everyday @entity27			1
@entity28 , though , makes @entity8 look like a booming metropolis			1
it takes only a few yards past the @entity32 checkpoint to wonder whether you stepped through a time portal : there are carts drawn by donkeys and horses , and poverty that makes you cringe			1
palestinians : the big divide in @entity43 , a billboard reminds you only fools get optimistic about prospects for peace here : it is a celebration of the @entity32 military wing that is responsible for , among other things , rocket attacks in @entity54 communities			1
it does n't have to be this way : we visited a soda bottling plant and a furniture factory that offer economic hope			2
but the owners of both say employment is way down -- from 150 people to 20 at the furniture factory -- because they can no longer export through @entity54 and have trouble getting supplies			2
just about everyone in @entity28 blames @entity54			2
but several passersby , after nervously looking around , also told me @entity32 shared some of the blame for making peace such a distant hope			2
this will linger : the smiles and jokes from children who came to say hello and get some candy from my @entity1 colleague @entity81			2
their eyes still sparkle with hope , a counterbalance to the violent graffiti and posters that make one worry if the leaders here can ever set aside their hate and mistrust			2
5 things to know about @entity18 's first presidential visit to @entity54 this is my ninth visit to @entity54 in the past 25 years , and i 'm always reminded of college and my first reporting job in @entity98 : everything is so close			1
@entity28 to @entity0 is just shy of 50 miles			0
drive a few more -- again toward @entity8 -- and you are better schooled in how land is the currency of the @entity54 - @entity27 conflict			0
@entity21 villages abut @entity54 settlements like @entity106 and @entity107			0
is this the way it is supposed to be ? or is it an @entity54 effort to " change the facts on the ground " ? it depends on whom you ask , of course			1
the one thing those with different answers seem to share is distrust of those who disagree with them			0
opinion : @entity18 's @entity54 trip is about legacy you can hear gunfire every day			1
on a @entity9 hillside we visited @entity130 , a security training academy			0
vigilance is the motto here , and among those learning hand to hand combat and marksmanship are security personnel for the @entity0 light rail and @entity141 settlers who are part of their community security structure			0
the man who runs the school is a combat veteran and colonel in the @entity54 reserves			0
he laughs while telling the story of how his mother hoped there would be peace and he would never have to serve in the @entity152			0
@entity153 says he is already telling his children they are all but certain to serve because , as he put it so simply , " you live in @entity54			0
" @entity0 is the @entity156 , cherished ground to three great faiths : @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			0
a walk through history is also a reminder of how home , the @entity16 , is , from a chronological perspective , a baby in the world			0
@entity54 president : no doubt @entity18 has @entity54 's back from the @entity171 to @entity172 is just 34 miles as the bird flies but a fast - forward in time : there , high - tech rules , and the walkway along the @entity178 is packed with young @entity54 professionals and their families			1
most are n't interested in talking politics			0
those who will have mixed opinions of president @entity18 , and if nothing else voiced hope this trip would melt away some of the personal chill between the @entity16 president and their prime minister			1
like the young eyes in @entity28 , the stunning sunset here gives pause , and ca n't help but make you think this is supposed to be a less fragile place .			0
