@entity0 -- hours before the official announcement that president @entity3 had landed in @entity4 , @entity5 , for a surprise visit , the media -- both social and electronic -- were already buzzing with reports about the trip			1
had he indeed landed in - country ? was it just a rumor ? should it be reported anyway ? some , including those inside the administration , were actively concerned about the safety of the commander in chief as he arrived in a war zone , while others felt any word of the president 's visit was public information and fair game in today 's competitive , instant news cycle			2
before the day began , the administration issued what was later revealed to be a fake presidential schedule , having the president and vice president in meetings throughout the day at the @entity33			1
early tuesday morning , an @entity5 official told @entity1 that the palace staff in @entity4 was instructed to go home at noon local time , 3:30 a.m. et , sparking rumors of a vip visit to the city			1
then , shortly after 9 a.m. et , @entity5 - based 24 - hour news channel @entity41 filed a @entity43 post announcing the president 's supposed arrival in @entity5			1
( the tweet has since been deleted from its feed			0
) @ tolonews " breaking : @entity50 president @entity3 has arrived in @entity4 to meet @entity5 president @entity51			1
" minutes later , the @entity53 's @entity52 retweeted @ @entity54 with a question : @ joshuahersh " is this right ? @entity56 : @entity50 president @entity3 has arrived in @entity4 to meet @entity5 president @entity51 " but , at 9:32 a.m , the @entity50 @entity57 in @entity4 announced via @entity43 : @entity59 " reports that president @entity3 is in @entity4 are false			1
" that was enough to send the @entity61 and traditional media buzzing			0
the @entity63 posted a story on its website shortly after 10 a.m. reporting the president was in @entity5			1
" @entity3 arrives in @entity5 report says ; @entity33 denies it , " read the @entity53 's headline			1
the story was later removed from the paper 's website			0
" where is @entity3 , " read a similar headline on @entity73			1
many of the publications that posted early reports on the president 's visit later pulled their stories			1
however , @entity73 kept its post up			0
early reports often wrong at the time , all those reports were wrong , or at least premature , according to the administration			1
the @entity33 later reported @entity84 actually landed in @entity5 at 2 p.m. et yes , the president had indeed secretly traveled to @entity5 , a trip loaded with symbolism on the one - year anniversary of @entity90 's killing			1
but virtually all of the major media organizations that were in a position to have known about the trip did not report it until it was officially announced around 3 p.m. et. the trip took place in the wake of security questions raised last month following a scandal that erupted when several members of a @entity103 advance team in @entity104 , @entity105 , solicited prostitutes before the president 's arrival at the @entity109			2
and in march , several news outlets , at the @entity33 's request , removed stories about daughter @entity114 's spring break trip to @entity115			1
but balancing news interests against security interests is nothing new for @entity33 reporters			1
@entity1 's @entity120 , host of " @entity120 , @entity50 , " said he faced a similar challenge during a trip to @entity123 with then - president @entity124 as he visited newly minted prime minister @entity125			2
" we were told we were not supposed to tell our family , " @entity120 told @entity1 's @entity126 on tuesday			0
" we were supposed to tell one or two of our colleagues , meaning our bosses , and to keep it as secret as possible			2
" a secret rendezvous in the dark of night news organizations who were a part of the traveling press pool covering the president 's surprise @entity5 visit -- a small group of reporters , producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the @entity33 press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the @entity33 's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in @entity4 , according to @entity33 pool reports			1
hours earlier , reporters had secretly gathered at a remote parking area at @entity156 outside @entity0 , had all their electronic gear confiscated -- cell phones , laptops , cameras , " anything that might have tracking software " -- and were driven by bus to a darkened @entity84 waiting in the shadows on the tarmac			2
after an 11 - hour flight , the media -- and the president -- found themselves in a steep descent into @entity171 in @entity5 , the official modified @entity172 still shrouded in darkness			1
on trips such as these , it is safest for the president to land and takeoff under cover of night			0
" we landed at @entity171 at 1020p local and got onto @entity185 helicopters that were waiting with rotors spinning , " reported pool producer @entity180 of @entity182			0
" the short flight to @entity4 was also in blackout -- no use of any flashlights or even phones due to their backlit screens			0
pilots and gunners used night vision goggles			0
" within hours , @entity3 and @entity5 president @entity51 had signed a @entity196 , setting the framework for a @entity50 military presence in the war - torn nation for the next decade			1
then , @entity3 addressed cheering troops at @entity171 , spoke to the nation in a live remote address and was wheels - up , safely clearing @entity5 airspace			1
" @entity205 is blacked out as it was on arrival with shades down			0
but the increasing light limits the value of that precaution , " reported the press pool			0
" we are on @entity205 and rolling 425a local 755 pm @entity213 " total time on the ground was six hours and five minutes			2
@entity33 plugging holes the early reports of the president 's @entity5 trip sent @entity221 spokesman @entity220 scurrying to douse the rumors			1
according to the website @entity224 , that outlet agreed to the @entity33 request and pulled its report after @entity220 called around 9:33 a.m. the @entity63 followed suit , removing its story hours later			2
@entity220 did not respond to @entity1 's request for comment			0
" it was n't that hard a call , " @entity224 editor - in - chief @entity232 told @entity1			0
" there 's an appropriate tradition of deferring to @entity33 and military requests to delay -- not spike -- a story when they believe people in a war zone could be in danger			2
" " and a plane in the air above @entity5 , the situation , as we later learned , is a pretty clear case of that , " @entity232 added			2
" @entity220 's narrow denial also telegraphed the situation to media watchers paying close attention			0
" but media experts acknowledge the press has to walk a fine line between the need to get the news out and the safety of the president			2
journalists must often ask themselves the question " what does the public need to know and when do they need to know it , " said @entity261 , a senior faculty member at @entity262 , a media training organization in @entity263 , @entity264			0
@entity261 said that in the harried and hypercompetitive world of reporting via social media , outlets sometimes reason that a competitor 's scoop signals a green light to rush ahead with news			0
this is a dangerous precedent when national security is concerned , he said			0
" no , you ca n't unring the bell , but you can stop ringing it , " @entity261 said			0
