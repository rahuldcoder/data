-- frowned upon in business meetings and scorned by bosses , the common doodle has long been condemned as the offspring of the slovenly and the cynical ... until now			1
oddly enough , doodling has even been the subject of academic research			1
in 2009 , @entity8 , psychology professor at the @entity9 conducted a study to find out whether drawing hinders or improves attention to a primary task			0
forty participants were tested and the results concluded that doodling aids concentration by reducing an individual 's capacity to daydream whether in the workplace or the classroom			2
the doodlers in the study retained about 29 % more information than non-doodlers			2
so @entity0 spoke to author and doodling evangelist @entity26 about how sketching at work can make you more productive and whether we 're seeing the dawn of a doodling revolution			1
@entity0 : when did you first make your doodling discovery ? @entity26 : i 've been going into working environments for several years now to teach visual thinking and how to solve business problems through a combination of images , words and thought experiments			1
what i noticed was a complete lack of competency in all working cultures -- except for design , engineering and some creative consulting firms -- in visual language			0
because like so many adults today , i , too , was raised in a culture that placed virtually no value on visual language but eventually i learned the importance of developing my own , and now i 'm trying to help people to improve their visual literacy and articulation			0

simple visual language has always offered a way to share and pass on information and history			2
in today 's business world , i refer to @entity73 founder @entity72 , author and professor @entity75 , and @entity76 , architect and creator of the @entity79 , as examples of prolific doodlers who use doodling to think and to solve problems			2

so if you look at it through that lens , what it does for people is a variety of things			0
some of those benefits include increased creativity , because you 're liberating your mind from traditional , linear and linguistic thinking and moving into a more organic thinking space , heightened information processing , heightened information retention and the ability to view content from a variety of different angles			2
read more : where is self - control in the brain ? @entity0 : can doodling actually help someone 's concentration levels ? @entity26 : by physically drawing shapes , images and letters , we are inviting our minds to slow down and to focus on that experience			1
doodling absolutely influences and aids concentration as well as elevating information retention , since it allows people to bring what 's happening right now into a more saturated and sensory experience			1
@entity0 : could doodling work for a younger generation , who may struggle to concentrate ? @entity26 : in the digital age , concentration is a rare commodity			1
we are constantly having to keep up with vast amounts of content from various platforms and by doodling people can associate that information with a visual aid			1
it also encourages insight that you would n't otherwise have			0
when we are problem solving , we usually have mature ways of thinking about a problem and when people switch into doodling - mode they find themselves looking at that problem from a different angle			2
read more : what we learn from doodles @entity0 : how can doodling help us to be successful ? @entity26 : there 's a number of ways that doodlers can deploy sketching and drawing to be successful			1
one way is to maintain focus on what is happening			0
people doodling are harnessing energy that would otherwise just dissipate , which makes it possible for them to stay present with whatever is happening and relieve boredom			2
another way is to allow access to different insights			0
by doodling , you 're connecting neurological pathways with otherwise disassociated pathways in the brain , making spontaneous marks with your body to help your mind access insights			2

these can be called " infodoodles , " using a combination of drawings , shapes and letters to formulate and display an idea			0
@entity200 founder @entity199 is a great example of this			0
he used whiteboards and physical movement to illustrate his concepts , according to people he worked with			0
i would call him a " kinesthetic doodler			0
" he was a person who seemed to think better while making spontaneous actions with his body			0

most of us have preconceived ideas about doodling			1
there 's a lot to overcome			0
i have seen working cultures that get it and its use is a no - brainer for them , and there are areas where people are embracing it whole - heartedly			0
in my view , people are far more open to it than they ever were but there 's still a long road ahead before it 's fully understood and applied .			0

@entity26 : doodles are an ancient human art form
doodling is a way to visualize ideas and learn more *quickly* , says @entity26
studies show those who doodle retain more of the information they are taught
