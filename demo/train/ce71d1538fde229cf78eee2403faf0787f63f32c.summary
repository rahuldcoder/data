-- @entity1 spent much of his life believing that girls should get an education			2
he always made sure his daughter @entity5 understood that			1
months after @entity8 militants gravely wounded the 15 - year - old with a bullet to the head for being vocal about that belief , he thinks more people around the world and in his home country agree with him			2
last october , the teenager was riding home in a school van in the @entity19 , a @entity8 stronghold in @entity20 , when masked men stopped the vehicle			1
they demanded that the other girls identify @entity5			1
the trained their guns on their target and fired			2
then they shot another girl , wounding her			0
@entity5 was treated by @entity20 doctors in the initial days after the shooting			1
as international outrage grew , @entity20 took to the streets			1
shooting a little girl ? the @entity8 had gone too far this time			0
the government had better do something			0
around the world , more people began learning about how the @entity8 , years earlier , had ordered that all girls leave school			0
@entity5 " is the daughter of the whole world , " her father told @entity0 on friday			1
" the world owns her			0
" she has become an icon of education , a symbol of girls ' rights			2
" she has made a difference , " said			0
@entity5 is getting stronger by the day , and " recovering very well , very fast , " he added			1
the teen was discharged from a hospital in @entity54 , @entity55 , in february and is receiving rehabilitative care			0
a team of international doctors who took over @entity5 's care from @entity20 providers certainly did amazing work in saving her life			1
they addressed her brain swelling			0
her skull had fractured in tiny pieces from the gunshot at close range			0
she has endured numerous surgeries			0
but apart from top - notch medicine , sheer force of will that has aided in @entity5 's recovery			1
her attitude has won over people worldwide			0
in february she was walking , and talking -- and saying she was going to get back to her advocacy for girls ' education			2
" @entity84 has given me this new life , " she said at the time , in her first on - camera interview			0
" i want to serve the people			0
i want every girl , every child , to be educated			0
" @entity88 was an educator for many years and first inspired his daughter to take a stand			1
but how likely will @entity5 's work and physical sacrifice actually lead to greater access to quality education for girls in @entity20 ? it 's unlikely for her own safety that @entity5 will ever be able to return there , and unlikely for her father as well , say observers who know @entity20 well			1
@entity101 : your messages to @entity5 @entity0 put that question to @entity88			1
@entity20 's government has appointed him education @entity106 © in the @entity20 consulate in the @entity109			1
@entity88 responded to the question by first pointing out that before his daughter was attacked , regular @entity20 would call and tell him that they 'd seen @entity5 speaking out on television and , inspired , enrolled their daughters in school			1
she 'd received a huge amount of global attention , especially from western media , after writing a blog for the @entity118 when she was 11			0
she described her fear that the @entity8 would keep her from learning			0
after @entity5 was shot , stirring international condemnation , @entity88 was heartened			1
" when this tragic incident happened , small kids , they had posters , banners [ with @entity5 's face and message ] and they [ related to and knew about ] @entity5 , " @entity88 said			1
" i think it was a big change			0
" there have been developments in @entity20 , but it 's difficult to call them victories			1
a university in @entity20 changed its name to include @entity5 , but then students protested out of fear that @entity5 's name would draw unwanted and potentially dangerous attention			1
@entity5 asked them to remove it			1
in march , two of @entity5 's friends were honored -- but those honors would not have been granted had they not been on that bus with @entity5			1
in an interview with @entity0 , one girl , @entity145 , said " @entity84 forbid something like that would happen again			0
" she said she can not go to visit her uncles or aunts like i used to			0
" but both girls said they want to be doctors and are going to continue their studies			0
@entity154 selected her to be runner - up in this year 's @entity157			2
this year , @entity20 will observe @entity5 's 16th birthday as " @entity5			1
" former @entity109 prime minister @entity159 joined @entity88 in the interview			2
@entity159 , now the @entity162 special envoy on global education , has been pushing @entity20 authorities to follow through in meaningful , practical ways that will improve girls ' access to quality education			1
@entity159 in his own words about girls ' education in @entity20 " i was there in @entity20 at the time [ of @entity5 's shooting ] , " @entity159 said			1
" i think 2 million people have signed a petition calling for universal free education			2
" @entity159 met with @entity20 's president @entity178 , who had visited @entity5 in the hospital in the @entity109 and vowed to stand up for girls ' education and fight extremism			1
beyond @entity20 , @entity159 said there seems to be a new passion internationally for ensuring girls ' rights			2
opinion : girls ' courage , @entity8 cowardice girls and women are saying , @entity159 believes , that they are not " prepared to take this anymore			0
" @entity159 noted the cultural complacency toward rape of women in @entity197 that was brought to light when a woman was gang - raped in @entity201 in december			0
she died of wounds from the attack			0
demonstrators in @entity206 are protesting the severely limited rights of women there , @entity159 said , and @entity210 girls have formed safe zones in which children will never be forced to marry adults , a common practice			0
who are the @entity20 @entity8 ? but inside @entity20 and other parts of the world , change comes slow			2
" we thought we would have a ' @entity222 ' but that never happened , " said @entity219 , a fellow at the @entity220			0
he was a reporter for the @entity224 in @entity20 , working in the @entity226 tribal area along the border with @entity228			2
@entity88 hosted @entity219 when he wrote about @entity5			1
" no one has said , ' let 's slash the defense budget and allocate it to education , ' " @entity219 said			2
" no one has been arrested in the attack on @entity5			2
you have the girls ' school who did n't want @entity5 's name			1
" he said he does n't believe there 's an heir - apparent for @entity5 in @entity20 and that safety concerns would make it impossible for her or her father to return			1
" you need someone on the ground to lead social change , " he said			0
" it 's not the job of @entity159 or people sitting outside			2
you have to be there among the people			0
and right now there is no political leadership who can do that			0
" the military has failed to chase after militants , the journalist said			0
and then there 's the complex issue of @entity20 's relationship with the @entity8 , he noted			1
" the government had a chance , an opportunity [ in the days after @entity5 's shooting ] , " he said			1
" i do n't want to be pessimistic , but i 'm afraid that chance is probably gone			0

@entity5 is " recovering very well , very fast , " her father said friday
@entity88 said his daughter has had an international impact
