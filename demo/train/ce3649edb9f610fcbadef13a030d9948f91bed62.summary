tucked inside the defense authorization bill that the @entity1 passed friday was an unrelated public lands package that 's set to bring the biggest expansion to the @entity4 in decades			1
despite some conservative opposition — a chorus that skewered the legislation as a pork - barrel land grab — the measure also establishes thousands of acres of new wilderness areas			1
the bill designates seven sites as official national park units , many of which place a special emphasis on history , such as @entity19 work sites in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			2
@entity24 , other national parks could cost more sites in @entity26 related to @entity28 's life will be added as a park unit , and parts of the @entity31 in @entity32 will be formally named a part of the @entity4			1
@entity34 outside of @entity35 is set to become a national monument , preserving its thousands of fossils that show traces of @entity41 mammoths , bison , and @entity44 lions			0
" this legislation clearly demonstrates that @entity48 and the administration are making national parks a national priority , " said @entity45 , president of @entity46			1
untamed wilderness in the @entity53 the legislation also expands nine national park sites — such as the @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 — and extends funding for 15 national heritage areas			2
@entity59 told , roughly 120,000 acres will be newly managed by the park service , and the number of official park units will jump from 401 to 408			0
that many acres may not sound like a lot - @entity65 's @entity64 alone is six million acres - but it 's the single largest package of park units approved since an omnibus parks bill in 1978 that authorized 14 new units			1
in addition to new park units , the bill also establishes 245,000 acres of new wilderness land , nearly half of which was already being managed by federal employees			2
summer in the park : @entity79 while the bill passed with bipartisan support , it did not come without drama			1
thirty - two republicans voted against the defense authorization package in the @entity86 last week , in part because of its inclusion of park and wilderness provisions			0
on the @entity1 side , just hours before the final vote on friday , sen. @entity91 , @entity92 , took to the floor to call for the public lands provisions to be stripped from the defense bill , saying the expansion was a " disastrous idea " because any new funding needs to go towards improving the current parks system			1
" our parks are falling apart			0
there 's $ 12 billion backlog on our most pristine , greatest national monuments and parks , " he said , referring to the @entity4 's coffers			1
" we should preserve what we 've already invested in			0
" sen. @entity111 , @entity112 , argued in a floor speech wednesday that drafters of the legislation " egregiously " forced the public lands provisions in the package through a " distorted legislative process			0
" sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , called it an " extreme " land grab and urged the @entity86 and @entity1 not to pass it			0
" with the military 's shrinking budget , it is offensive that this bill would be used to fund congressional pork , " he said in a statement last week			2
@entity129 , senior director of legislation and policy , at the @entity46 , argued that much of the parks land is already owned by the government and is merely changing management			2
millions flocked to national parks last year , despite shutdown the @entity139 , for example , oversees @entity140 , but will soon be run by the @entity4			1
the @entity141 owns @entity19 sites			0
and the federal government owns @entity144 but the location is currently managed by a special trust			0
the legislation also includes some concessions for @entity84 , including 110,000 acres of federal land being released into private or state control through conveyances , exchanges or sales .			0

@entity48 passed major parks and wilderness legislation
it 's the largest expansion for the @entity4 in decades
while the bill had bipartisan support , it *underwent* some *turbulence* by conservatives
