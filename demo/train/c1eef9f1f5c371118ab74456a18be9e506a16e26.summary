-- @entity2 , the announcer whose velvety baritone voice introduced " @entity4 " hosts on @entity5 for decades , has died at age 96 , the network announced			1
@entity2 was the announcer for " @entity4 " for all but one season over the program 's 39 - year run			1
prior to announcing for the comedy show , he was a familiar voice on @entity5 , handling the announcing duties on such programs as the old " @entity15 " and the @entity17 - hosted version of " @entity18 ! " in a tweet , " @entity23 " described @entity2 as " legendary , " and cast members from " snl 's " long run chimed in with approval			1
" any snl actor will tell u : the ultimate moment of your career was hearing @entity2 say your name			1
each week he represented a dream come true , " tweeted @entity30 , who appeared on the show from 1999 to 2006			0
@entity33 , who spent years on " snl " before recently beginning his own late - night talk program , wrote , " rip @entity2			1
a voice that meant so much			0
" @entity2 was born in @entity36 , @entity37 , on february 22 , 1918			1
he began his career in theater in his native @entity40 , but switched to announcing after being offered a job by a @entity43 , @entity44 , radio station			0
while visiting @entity5 in @entity45 in 1944 -- there to see some of his heroes at work -- @entity2 was offered a job with the network , according to the @entity51			1
he stayed for the next seven decades			0
he became a familiar voice to generations of radio listeners and , later , tv watchers			0
indeed , he was the @entity5 staff announcer on november 22 , 1963 , when president @entity56 was shot			1
" he was among the first to tell the nation about the assassination attempt on president @entity56 , " according to @entity59			1
the next year , he became the announcer for a game show that almost rivaled @entity2 himself for longevity : " @entity18 ! " the original version , with @entity17 as host , ran from 1964 to 1975			2
@entity2 could regularly be heard telling viewers that the show 's questions came from the @entity69 encyclopedia and promising contestants some nice parting gifts , including a supply of @entity73 , " the @entity75 treat			2
" in 1984 , @entity2 got a chance to parody himself on " @entity78 's recording of " @entity79 , " informing the floundering @entity78 that he was " a complete loser			2
" he also had a bit part in the video			0
" very sad to hear of the passing of my old friend @entity2 - truly one the all - time greats , " tweeted @entity78			2
. but for most people under 50 , @entity2 will always be the voice of " @entity4			1
" though he was on staff at @entity5 , he seemed an odd choice for the show , his seemingly strait - laced bearing contrasting with the wild antics of what was , originally , the most iconoclastic comedy show on network tv			2
but that , said " @entity4 " creator @entity97 , was the idea			0
" it could n't have been a more different culture , " @entity97 told @entity51			0
" but it was perfect for us			0
