-- golf is a sport where concentration and the ability to perform under pressure is key			2
so how was @entity6 feeling during sunday 's final round of the @entity8 , knowing he was within touching distance of winning his first major title ? " i could n't really feel my hands or my legs , " the 26 - year - old told @entity0 after carding 68 in each of the two final rounds to finish one over par at @entity16 's @entity15			1
" my legs felt like they were a couple of hundred pounds each ... it was very nerve - wracking			1
" but the new world no. 5 put together a run of four birdies in six holes in the middle of his final round to move above overnight leaders @entity29 , who missed a 25 - foot putt at the 18th to force a playoff , and fellow @entity33 @entity32			1
" i 'm pretty excited , i 'm pretty worn out , " he said , after clinching the third @entity36 title of his four - year career and taking home the $ 1.44 million first prize			1
" it 's such a long week , such a grueling week on your mind , and this place is hard to walk			2
so physically it 's a tough week as well			2
" but i could n't have imagined i 'd be @entity8 champion this early in my career			1
i did n't expect that it would come this quickly			2
one thing i 've always done is i 've never put limits on what can happen with this game			0
" the @entity53 native , who tied for 14th at @entity54 last year in his only previous @entity8 appearance , is hoping to capitalize on the run of form which has propelled him to one of golf 's four biggest prizes			1
" you can get on runs out here , you wins and your good play comes in bunches			0
i want to take advantage of that			0
one thing i pride myself in is remembering how i got here and remembering what makes me tick as a golfer , " he said			0
" so win or lose i 'm trying to get better , and that 's what i 've been trying to do for the last couple of years			2
" @entity74 said the continued shouts from the crowds gathered on the @entity77 kept him guessing on a foggy day in @entity78			1
" this week i felt like they were especially great			0
i looked at my caddy on 14 and asked him , ' are the crowds are lot louder today ? ' because it seemed like we were hearing roars every few minutes , " he said			0
" it was so fun to play in an atmosphere like that			0
the famous 18th hole , coming down the hill and going back up to the clubhouse , is probably the coolest finish i can imagine in golf			0
" despite becoming the third consecutive @entity33 winner of a major -- following on from @entity95 at the masters and @entity97 at the @entity98 -- and the 15th different major winner in a row , @entity74 's participation at next month 's @entity93 is in doubt			1
he and his wife @entity102 are awaiting the birth of their second child , and @entity74 is looking forward to sharing his tale of @entity108 glory with his children in the years to come			1
" i got to talk to my dad and i told him , ' @entity108 , ' and he said it was a pretty good @entity108 present for him			0
it 's a fun memory that i ca n't wait to share with my son one day			0

@entity6 says his hands and legs were shaking during @entity8 final round
the @entity33 finished one over par to win his first major title at @entity15
he is the 15th different major winner in a row , and the third consecutive @entity33
@entity74 may miss the @entity93 *due* to the *imminent* birth of his second child
