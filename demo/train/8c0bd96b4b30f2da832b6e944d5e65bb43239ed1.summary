-- hockey or debt ceiling ? watching both are @entity5 national pastimes these days , especially for businessmen such as @entity7			1
except , the political show comes with a big dose of concern			0
like many @entity5 , @entity7 , owner of @entity11 in @entity12 , said he feels quiet pride from closely following @entity15 politics and knowing his country is generally free of the acerbic partisan wrangling of its powerhouse southern neighbor			1
but he fears a @entity15 default , if it were to occur , would be sure to hit home hard			1
" the whole thing drives us a little crazy , " he said			0
" you 're the elephant and we 're the mouse : when you roll over we can get crushed			0
" more than 50 % of @entity11 ' business is in the @entity15			2
if @entity28 ca n't find a way to break the debt ceiling impasse , folks like @entity7 could pay a heavy price			2
nobody can predict the precise global consequences of a @entity15 default , but several economic experts said the ensuing panic could fall hard on @entity5 , the @entity15 ' largest trading partner			1
a default would likely lead to a downgrading of @entity15 's stellar aaa - credit rating , which could send interest rates -- the cost of borrowing -- skyward			1
in a worst - case scenario , this would grind bank lending to a halt , slowing economic activity and plunging the @entity15 -- where @entity5 does 75 % of its trading -- back into recession , according to @entity50 , a professor of public policy at the @entity52			1
with approximately 20 % of world gdp comprised in @entity15 , the international business community has a lot riding on the debt negotiations , @entity50 said			1
but @entity5 businessmen such as @entity58 , whose business is also heavily dependent on @entity15 customers , may have more to lose than most			1
" it would be devastating , no doubt about it , " said @entity58 , chief executive officer @entity61 , a company that makes hinges in @entity64 , @entity65			0
roughly one in five jobs in @entity5 is dependent on the @entity15 , said @entity71 , chief economist of the @entity72			1
" any material change to the @entity15 economy is quickly felt on this side of the border , " he said			2
" there is a sense of pride in @entity5 's regulatory , financial and political systems ... but @entity5 ca n't afford to laugh off the troubles in the @entity15 , " he said			1
" it does n't take too long for an economic weakness south of the border to send our own economy into trouble			0
" for this reason , @entity90 , president of @entity91 , said her organization has intently followed the debt ceiling talks			0
the uncertainty has even driven up the value of the @entity5 dollar			2
" that 's going to kick the pants out of ( @entity5 ) exporters , " she said			2
" some are saying that @entity5 would become more of a safe haven for investments , but that 's a financial market thing			0
in terms of the real economy , this is bad news			0
" @entity5 is already feeling the reverberations			0
the @entity109 fell more than 450 points this week and reached a one - month low friday amid the uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling talks			0
perhaps in an attempt to assuage worries , @entity5 finance minister @entity114 said this week that he was " relatively confident " the @entity15 will raise the debt ceiling			1
but he warned that @entity15 's broader deficit gap would remain a long - term problem that could hurt @entity5 as well			1
" we 're a trading nation and it matters to us that our most important trading partner has their fiscal house in order , " @entity120 said			1
compared to the @entity15 and @entity128 -- where several countries are saddled with deficit crises -- @entity5 is on a clear path to a balanced budget by 2014 , @entity120 said			1
" @entity5 looks relatively good on the world stage , " he said			0
asked if @entity5 had contingency plans for a default , @entity120 said , " what we are doing in @entity5 is what we 're able to do in @entity5			2
" still , some @entity5 business owners expressed frustration with what they called @entity15 fiscal recklessness and its impact on @entity5			1
" i 'm not surprised , given the reputation of @entity15 to be arrogant , that they are once again in this crisis situation , " said @entity145 , part - owner of @entity146 , a clothing retailer based in @entity148 that does about a quarter of its business in the @entity15			0
in her view , @entity15 " seem to attract crises			0
" @entity5 , she said , are conservative			0
whatever their nature , @entity5 businessman ought to be paying close attention to the drama unfolding in @entity28 , said @entity160 of @entity161			0
a default , he said , would have a " horrible ripple effect " in @entity5			2
but @entity160 was sure @entity5 would survive a default of any magnitude			2
@entity166 that up to old - fashioned principles			0
" we pay down our debt , " he said , " and do n't buy based on credit , as you do in the @entity15			1
