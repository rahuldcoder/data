the @entity1 posted some of its secret footage on its web site			0
the footage includes an animal with what the group said was a self - inflicted wound , another animal jumping in circles in its cage , and chimpanzees screaming as lab technicians approached with a dart gun			1

agriculture secretary @entity57 said he will order a thorough investigation of animal welfare practices at the facility			1

they have a sense of self , they have a sense of past and future , they have the wide range of emotions that we have , " he said			0
" they should not be subjected to this long - term , decade - long isolation , and all these painful and physical procedures and the psychological torment in these laboratories			0
" the @entity10 says it offers a " broad range of diagnostic , laboratory , and human resources for the development and characterization of nonhuman primate models for applied and basic research aimed at promoting human quality of life			2
" in its statement e-mailed to @entity0 , the center said it has made numerous contributions to public health improvements for the prevention and treatment of three forms of hepatitis , mumps , measles , chicken pox and mad cow disease			0
