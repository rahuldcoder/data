the @entity51 city has a diverse history , mixing @entity54 and @entity55 influences			2
the festival begins in december and runs through the end of february			1
" it was as weird and wonderful as it sounds			2
big replicas of famous buildings from around the world			2
working restaurants and hotels and shops made of ice , " said @entity63 , a professor at @entity64 and editor of the @entity66 , who visited the @entity32 in 2005			1
. " all sorts of ice art and games			1
and thousands of people wandering in couples or small groups , nearly all smiling and eating frozen fruit on a stick			2

the @entity80 this season opened on december 7 and will close approximately mid-april			0
the @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 elephants on ice ? sounds crazy , but this festival is based on the ancient invasion of @entity132 by @entity134 military leader @entity133 , who marched three - dozen african elephants and some 60,000 soldiers across the @entity137 about 200 years @entity138 animal lovers have no need to despair , the elephants are represented by snow grooming machines , and acrobatic skiers perform as warriors			1
this year 's glacier theater will be held on april 12 and is expected to attract about 7,000 viewers			0
" the @entity133 spectacle is unique in the @entity137 , " with more than 500 artists performing on a huge natural stage , said @entity148 of the @entity150 tourism office			0
" crazy things are going to happen , from base jumpers , helicopters , artificial avalanches , fireworks , snowcats , monumental music			0
" the spectacle is held at night , at an altitude of 3,000 meters			0

ski by day and dance by night , too , with the @entity172 international dj event , going on through march			0
@entity173 many travelers think of @entity175 as sultry , with images of @entity179 's carnival and the @entity180 burned into the mind			0
the deepest south in @entity175 is anything but , however			0
a wild , unspoiled region of ice - covered mountains , glaciers and the frozen tundra of endless @entity188 , which stretches between @entity189 and @entity190			1
one of the most comfortable ways to see this region is through @entity193 , a cruise company operating in @entity189 's @entity173 and around @entity194 and the @entity195 , an area @entity197 passed through on his famous @entity199 voyage			0
passengers explore the scenery and the amazing wildlife , from penguins to sea lions to whales , on at least two mini-expeditions a day in zodiacs , returning to the comfort of the ship to socialize over a glass of @entity212 wine or scotch served over 40,000 - year - old glacier ice			1
ships sail during @entity175 's warm season , running roughly from the end of september through the end of march			0
if you ca n't get to @entity189 during the warm season , head there during @entity175 's winter to ski at @entity222 in the @entity223 , about two hours from @entity224			1
@entity225 watching , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 who does n't love polar bears ? truth is , global warming means within the next few decades the world 's polar bear population is expected to rapidly plummet			1
with an environmentally mindful operator , you can see polar bears live in @entity226 , on the @entity227 in @entity238 , @entity239			1

the best polar bear viewing is generally in october and november , as @entity227 begins to freeze and bears take to the ice for hunting			1
some outfitters have vehicles with protected viewing platforms to allow photographers to safely take close shots of bears who might even try to climb aboard			0
other companies have remote lodges in the middle of bear territory			0
" the bears come all the way up to the fence , " of the lodges , said @entity240			0
bears can be as curious about visitors as visitors are about them and do wander into @entity226 itself , a potential danger			0
an interesting quirk of the town is that most cars are unlocked , allowing an easy escape from approaching polar bears			0
they might look cute , but they 're still bears			0

@entity321 ice fishing the thrill of @entity321 's wild frontier combined with the pleasure of fishing is what @entity326 offers outdoor enthusiasts , the outfitter , run by @entity330 , takes visitors fishing throughout the year			1
most of their ice fishing takes place in @entity336 about 40 miles north of @entity337			1
" our ice fishing season is only constrained by ice conditions			1
we can usually safely fish starting in late november around @entity340 , " @entity330 said			0
this year ice fishing trips started much earlier in november , but a very warm season may mean waiting to ice fish until late in december , he said			1
the season usually lasts into late march or early april			0
the thrill of fishing here has both to do with the size and quantity of the catch			1
" the largest landlocked salmon we caught on an ice fishing trip was likely about 16 inches			1
in the summertime , the largest king salmon taken by my guests have weighed in at 56 pounds			0
" most of the tour participants are locals from @entity337 , making it a great way to get to know @entity321			2

@entity369 is rich in wildlife , from whales to sea lions to emperor penguins and many other species of birds			2
zodiac boats allow for passengers to get close to the animals , with expert guides explaining the wildlife			2
trips alight on various islands and also the @entity411 to visit research stations run by different countries , giving a sense of the island 's recent human history and the fragility of our hold on this most remote part of the world , beautiful and full of thrilling danger all at once			0
expeditions run during the @entity424 summer , from approximately november to april			0
the experience can be life changing , said sales manager @entity427			0
