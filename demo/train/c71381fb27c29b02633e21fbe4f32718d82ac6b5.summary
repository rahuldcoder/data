-- @entity1 just revealed its own specially curated version of the @entity3 , but has chosen to label it the " @entity3			2
" @entity5 , in turn , has now sued @entity3 for trademark violation			0
the move is a not - so - subtle shot across @entity1 's bows			2
the suit was filed last week , but has emerged at more or less the same time as @entity1 's official unveiling tuesday of its @entity3 -- @entity1 's version of the free - for - all @entity13 that , on launch , contains 3,800 apps			1
it will operate under similar constraints , controls and profit sharing with developers as @entity5 's version , in the hopes that it will be distinguished from other @entity3 app markets by being " safer " and containing higher quality apps			2
but it 's the name @entity1 's chosen ( the @entity26 ) that 's got @entity5 rattled			1
@entity5 filed a trademark protection over the phrase " @entity29 " after the release of the @entity31 , making what an independent observer may deem a sensible business move -- especially since the @entity29 is now earning @entity5 a slight profit , and its archive of apps for @entity31 and @entity38 ( and now the @entity39 too ) is an incredibly potent advertising lever			1
as a result , the computer giant is now suing to prevent @entity1 from using the phrase " @entity44 " in any way , including marketing , and is also seeking damages			0
the accusation is that it 's a direct trademark infringement that may " confuse and mislead customers " according to an @entity5 spokesperson , which is the kind of half - true legal phrase often trotted out in cases like this			0
the @entity29 label is a big bone of contention to many folk at the moment			0
back in january , @entity60 postured against @entity5 's trademark , and has asked the @entity62 to void @entity5 's trademark request on the grounds that the phrase " ' app store ' " is generic for retail store services featuring apps and unregistrable for ancillary services such as searching for and downloading apps from such stores			1
" @entity60 was moving to protect its plans for @entity74 app store sales , and seemed ignorant of the irony in its request -- as you may recall , @entity60 's best - selling product is dubbed " @entity78 , " which would definitely seem an arbitrary label and has a very precisely - defined generic use in computing environments that long predates @entity60 's use of it			0
but what 's @entity5 really trying to do here ? one may suspect that @entity5 is actually mostly peeved that @entity1 is trying to leverage off @entity5 's own successful brand to push sales of a rival smartphone and tablet pc platform -- @entity3			1
the two companies have a complex friend - and - foe relationship , and @entity1 's @entity93 e-book reader app is prominent in the @entity38 ( and @entity31 ) @entity44 , while its kindle e-reader device is almost pitched as a direct competitor to the @entity38			0
the move to defend @entity5 's trademark indicates that @entity5 will act to aggressively protect its @entity29 ecosystem from challengers , which may include any plans @entity1 has to expand its @entity3 efforts			1
