editor 's note : @entity2 is on @entity3 nightly at 7 and 9 et and also hosts a conservative national radio talk show			1
@entity2 says we should take time to celebrate what 's right with @entity8 @entity9 ( @entity3 ) -- a few days before the @entity11 , i read a column in the @entity13 that said @entity8 did n't deserve to celebrate its independence this year			1
it claimed that all of our so - called atrocities have shamed the memory of our founding fathers and , as a result , we should cancel our parades , put away our fireworks and all sit quietly while we atone for our sins			2
i guess that was one way to go			2
another way to go would be to fire up the grills , bring the kids to the beach , and gather the family on a blanket to watch as your tax dollars ignite into colorful bursts			2
i 'm guessing that most of us chose the second option			2
but just because i had fun with friends and family does n't mean that i believe @entity8 is perfect			1
it just means that , for one day , i chose to celebrate the fact that @entity8 is still closer to perfect than any other country in the history of the world			1
for 364 days a year we talk about high gas prices , crooked politicians , and how much people from one political party allegedly hate everyone from the other			2
but for 24 hours we get to put it all aside and marvel at how a few brave men risked their lives to stand up for what they believed in			0
of course , i would prefer we celebrate that every day , but for now , or at least until that @entity13 columnist gets elected president and bans it , i 'll take the one			1
as someone who works in the media in @entity9 , i 'll admit that i am part of the chorus of people who talk about our problems			0
but there 's nothing wrong with that , so long as you also occasionally take the time to talk about the other side			0
and that 's what i want to do now by asking the question that never seems to be of interest to the mainstream media : what 's right with @entity8 ? let 's start with our much maligned economy			1
i 'm not trying to sugarcoat it , times are definitely tough for an awful lot of families right now			0
but you know what ? we 've made it through a depression ; we 've made it through wars , oil shocks , and major terrorist attacks and we 're still standing			0
in fact , we 're not just standing , we 're towering over the rest of the world			0
our economy is almost as big as the next four largest economies on @entity102 ( @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 ) combined			0
the state of @entity108 alone has an economy as large as the entire country of @entity111			2
@entity112 has the same gdp as all of @entity115			0
@entity9 matches the entire gdp of @entity117			0
@entity119 's economy is as large as @entity120 's			0
@entity121 has a gdp roughly equal to @entity122 's			0
@entity124 's economy is as large as the entire country of @entity126			2
it takes a lot longer to turn around an aircraft carrier than it does a dinghy , but the problem we have is with our ship 's captain -- the pea - brains in @entity136 -- not her crew			0
what 's right with @entity8 ? how about the way we educate our children			1
sure , i complain a lot about left - wing professors and how some wealthy private universities hoard their billions while charging obscene amounts for tuition , but the truth is that our universities are always ranked among the best in the world			0
students are n't fleeing @entity8 to go to college in @entity103 , @entity153 , or @entity105 -- it 's the other way around			1
we open our colleges and universities to more than 80,000 foreign professors , scholars and educators a year and we have more students in college right now than those three countries combined			0
what 's right with @entity8 ? our world - class universities do n't require you to have an elite family name or @entity168 - type wealth to get in			1
we do n't care about your race , gender or nationality			2
you just have to be smart enough and work hard for it			0
what a concept , huh ? what 's right with @entity8 ? how about the way we treat the less fortunate ? with no help from our government , @entity8 gave a record $ 306 billion to charities last year alone			1
we give twice as much as the next closest country and , relative to the size of our economies , we give 1,000 percent more than the @entity111			2
what 's right with @entity8 ? it 's not just the wealthy who are generous			1
two - thirds of @entity8 families making under $ 100,000 a year give to charity			1
compassion is ingrained in our culture like no other			0
what 's right with @entity8 ? how about our supposedly third - world health care system ? we spend more on health care per person than @entity195 , @entity104 , @entity122 , or any other country you can think of			1
do we still have problems ? absolutely , but do n't fall for " the grass is greener " crowd ; every country has health care problems			1
what 's right with @entity8 ? we love our country			1
@entity205 found that 77 percent of @entity8 are very proud of their nationality			1
that puts us in a first place tie with the @entity209			0
@entity210 was next and no one else was really even close			0
i could go on and on , but my point is that we do n't need the so often wished for " change " in this country , we just need perspective			1
while most of us inherently know that we 've won the lottery by living here , we do n't often think about the reasons why			2
so , for at least that one day , let 's just remember that @entity8 still leads the world in the principles that matter most : the rule of law , freedom of religion , equal rights , freedom from an oppressive government and , fortunately for the @entity13 , freedom of speech			1
