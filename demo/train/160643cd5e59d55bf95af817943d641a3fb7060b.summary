as you and your family look forward to countless holiday meals yet to come , the recently celebrated @entity3 might have passed by unnoticed			0
perhaps you 've never heard of this global effort to bring attention to the increasing problem of antibiotic - resistant infections			1
but if you found yourself pausing in front of the " antibiotic - free " turkey on sale in many stores at @entity12 , wondering what those words meant -- and why these birds are more expensive than ones without that label -- you 've already joined the debate about antibiotic use and misuse			2
the discovery of antibiotics revolutionized medicine some 75 years ago			0
it meant that bacterial infections that would otherwise result in death could be cured with miracle drugs like penicillin , sulfa and tetracycline			0
infections following battlefield injuries or surgical procedures could finally be treated			0
antibiotics could even be used to protect patients undergoing chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant from the potentially lethal consequences of a weakened immune system , allowing doctors to be more aggressive in the treatment of cancers			0
some infections did n't respond to antibiotics , because the bacteria that caused them were " resistant " -- that is , they could disable an antibiotic , or pump it out as fast as it got into a bacterial cell			2
some bacteria simply made alternate versions of the enzymes normally targeted by antibiotics , versions that were no longer blocked or inhibited by an antibiotic			2
usually , there was another antibiotic on the shelf that could still be counted on to work			0
but that is no longer the case for many of the multi-drug - resistant bacteria causing infections around the world			1
how did we get to this point ? the answer is complicated , but we can start with the turkey			0
for over 60 years , poultry and livestock have been fed antibiotics for their " growth - promoting " and " disease - preventing " effects			2
the @entity76 estimated that almost four - fifths of the 37 million pounds of antibiotics sold in the @entity79 in 2011 were for meat and poultry production			0
worldwide , more antibiotics are used for agriculture , aquaculture and horticulture than for treating humans			1
these antibiotics act on the bacteria that live on and in all animals , suppressing the growth of bacteria that are sensitive to the antibiotic and favoring the growth of bacteria that are resistant			1
a nightmare health scenario we can stop this selection of antibiotic - resistant bacteria in animals has consequences for humans			1
food - borne infections are increasingly caused by antibiotic - resistant salmonella or campylobacter , with outbreaks causing recalls and warnings			1
but the less headline - grabbing effects might be worse			0
antibiotic - resistant bacteria in the feces of livestock and poultry make their way to environmental water sources , contaminate commercially sold meat , and are transferred directly to humans with animal contact			1
these antibiotic - resistant organisms can transfer the genetic know - how for antibiotic resistance to other bacteria within us			1
because of this , the @entity124 banned the use of antibiotics in animals as growth promoters in 2006			1
why has n't the @entity130 done the same ? the agency on wednesday issued a proposal to phase out the use of certain antibiotics in food - producing animals			2
as early as 1973 , the @entity130 published a rule in the @entity137 directing drug companies to provide evidence that " subtherapeutic " antibiotic use in food animals to promote growth and prevent infection was safe -- or face withdrawal of approvals for such use			1
in 1977 , the @entity130 made an announcement , proposing to withdraw approval of penicillin and tetracycline for use in food animals for any purpose other than treating active infection			1
public hearings on the proposed withdrawals were to be held -- and that was the last action by the @entity130 until it withdrew the hearing notice in 2011 in response to suits by the @entity162 and others demanding that the @entity130 finally follow through on its plan from 1977			0
a ruling by @entity79 magistrate judge @entity166 in march 2012 ordered the @entity130 to reissue its findings and initiate withdrawal proceedings , a decision the @entity130 has since appealed			0
in the intervening 40 years , the evidence linking antibiotic use in food animals and antibiotic - resistant infections in humans has continued to grow			1
the 2008 report of the @entity176 on @entity177 documented this evidence , and made a priority recommendation to " phase out and then ban the nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials " in food animals			1
@entity183 sets threat levels for drug - resistant ' superbugs ' legislative efforts at the federal and state levels to implement this recommendation have met with no success , however , as detailed in the october 2013 follow - up by the @entity192			2
the @entity130 has done little more than to urge drug companies to " voluntarily " stop marketing antibiotics for growth promotion -- but antibiotic use for disease " prevention " is not discouraged , and proposed rules even weaken veterinary oversight of this practice			2
some opponents warn that modern agriculture will collapse if growth - promoting antibiotics are banned in food animals , but the evidence suggests the opposite			1
countries such as @entity209 , which reduced antibiotic use in animals by 60 % since 1994 through bans , government monitoring and voluntary cutbacks , saw no declines in total production of poultry or pigs as a result -- and no increase in the amount of feed needed to produce a pound of meat			0
in fact , pork production has increased by 50 % since 1994 , and @entity209 now exports 90 % of all it produces			0
@entity228 , a professor of law at @entity229 , argued this year in the @entity230 that the @entity130 is facing a " moment of truth , " a moment when " an administrative agency must confront evidence concerning a social problem it is charged with addressing , and speak the truth , as best it can , about it			0
" clearly , however , many entities involved in the sale and use of growth - promoting and preventive antibiotics in food animals profit from this practice and have effectively fought to delay its regulation and restriction			1
what can we do ? to start , vote with our wallets and buy turkey or chicken or ham that 's " raised without antibiotics			0
" it sends a small but important message that encourages farmers who voluntarily avoid the use of antibiotics for growth promotion or disease prevention			0
but it 's clear that the solution requires action on a bigger scale if the @entity79 is to implement recommendations made repeatedly for more than 40 years to limit antibiotic use in animals to the treatment of infections			2
hopefully , most of us have taken our doctors ' advice to heart and no longer demand antibiotics for ourselves or our children at the first sign of a cold , sore throat , or cough -- all common symptoms of viral infections , on which antibiotics have no effect			0
what government tests found in your meat encouragingly , the resulting decreases in antibiotic use in the community can be linked to decreases in antibiotic - resistant infections			1
campaigns to promote judicious use of antibiotics in hospitals are likewise followed by decreases in the number of infections caused by multi-drug - resistant bacteria			1
perhaps , in spite of the pressures to economize during this season , we can also examine the reasons used to justify antibiotic use in agriculture -- a bigger turkey or pig , sent to your table for a lower price -- and ask , are we really getting a bargain ?			0

the @entity124 in 2006 banned antibiotics in animals as growth promoters
more antibiotics are used for agriculture , aquaculture and horticulture than treating humans
evidence is growing linking antibiotics in food animals and antibiotic - resistant human infections
