-- when @entity2 won the @entity3 for the first and only time , he was at the peak of his powers			1
in 2001 , the tournament known as golf 's unofficial " fifth major " was held the week before the masters -- and @entity2 won both events as he became the only modern - day player to hold all four major crowns at the same time , albeit not in a calendar year			1
this week , at the age of 36 and struggling to rediscover his best form , the @entity14 will again line up at @entity18 -- but without the help of the man who helped him become the dominant force he was : coach @entity22			1
already he has had to fend off questions about his painfully long process of swing changes , and a disappointing showing at @entity27 last month and then again at @entity28 last week , where he missed the halfway cut			1
hopes had been raised by his pre-masters victory at @entity33 , his first on the @entity34 in more than two years , but since then his work with current coach @entity36 has been questioned by former players such as @entity38 and @entity39 , both now tv pundits			1
@entity39 offered : " he needs to fire @entity36 , call @entity22			0
he 's literally lost the art of the game , and i think @entity22 could help him			1
" @entity38 , who unlike @entity44 can call himself a major champion -- six times over -- is troubled by @entity2 ' apparent lack of confidence			1
" he just does n't have the self - belief , the self - confidence that he obviously had , the tiger of old -- simple as that , " the @entity48 said			0
@entity2 , for his part , insists that his work in progress is similar to previous frustrating periods rebuilding his swing with @entity22 and then @entity58 -- and he rebounded from those in a stellar career featuring 14 major titles and more than 80 professional victories			1
" i went for probably almost two years without doing much with @entity22 before it kicked in , and about a year and a half with @entity58 , " he told reporters ahead of thursday 's opening round			1
" with @entity36 it 's been almost two years			2
but i 've been hurt for a majority of that , so i have n't been able to put in the time			2
in essence , it takes time			2
" the fruits have been pretty good on the back side of it , and i think so far i 've shown some nice consistency , and i 'm still working			0
i just have n't had the time because obviously the injuries i 've had			2
" woods did admit that he might be thinking too much about his game , rather than just playing			0
" certainly it is ( like that ) when you 're making changes , " he said			2
" i 've done this before			0
i 've been through this			0
i went through those periods where i was n't quite where i wanted to be			0
i had some pretty good runs after that , and this is no different			0
" it takes a little bit of time , and i keep building , and things eventually come around to where they feel natural and efficient			2
i think that 's probably the most important word , is that you get out there and you feel efficient in what you 're doing			2
" @entity2 ' recent performances have highlighted another part of his game that needs work : his putting -- having needed 33 in the second round at @entity28 , and also struggling in finishing 40th at @entity27			1
i 'm not quite 100 % comfortable with it			0
i 've had to make some tweaks and some little bit of changes , " he said			0
" @entity27 was nice to have happen , actually , in the big scheme of things			0
just like it was at @entity114 a couple of years ago when i could n't cut the golf ball			0
i felt like i could have won that golf tournament , but not being able to cut it cost me eight or nine shots that week			1
" @entity27 was one of those things where it was just pretty glaring , some of the things i needed to work on			0
so get back to work and try and get ready for this week			0
" @entity2 will be in a high - profile grouping on thursday and friday as he lines up alongside @entity129 series leader @entity128 and another " @entity130 " in @entity131 , who won his first @entity34 title at @entity28 last weekend			1
@entity137 , who returned to world no. 1 by reaching the playoff on sunday , will partner @entity135 and another veteran @entity14 , @entity136 -- who was inducted into golf 's @entity140 on monday and was champion at @entity143 in 2007			1
@entity144 , who the lost the top ranking after skipping @entity28 , will play alongside fellow former no. 1 @entity146 and 2011 @entity129 champion @entity147 in the $ 9.5 million @entity149 tournament			1
masters champion @entity150 has decided to stay home with his wife and newly - adopted baby son .			0

@entity2 is struggling for form ahead of this week 's @entity3
former world no. 1 missed the cut at @entity28 on return to @entity34
he says the changes he is making to his swing will take time to bear fruit
@entity2 will play alongside @entity28 victor @entity131 at @entity18
