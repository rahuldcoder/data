-- how big is the financial hole ? this is the main question among @entity3 nowadays			1
they want to know how much money @entity5 , the country 's fourth - largest bank , needs			1
@entity5 was created in 2010 , a result of the merger of seven small entities including @entity12 and @entity5			1
such cajas -- regional savings banks with board members appointed by the local authorities -- devoted part of their profits to social purposes within their areas			0
they fell into enormous debt due to their investments in infrastructure , and thousands of houses which were never sold			0
@entity5 was a proposal of the ruling @entity27 ( @entity27 , conservatives )			2
the idea was to merge the saving banks and give an executive role to @entity32 , the former managing director of the @entity33 and first chairman of @entity5			1
before these posts , @entity32 was minister of the economy and @entity37 in the first and second cabinet of prime minister @entity39 , who led the country between 1996 and 2004			0
@entity32 was idolized in the conservative media , and credited with the previous cycle of economic growth			0
all was running smoothly until may , when the current minister of economy , @entity44 , forced @entity32 to resign as @entity5 president while the @entity46 ( the @entity3 agency for financial markets ) suspended the stock exchange of @entity5 when its price slumped to half its original value			1
now , as @entity5 sucks up financial aid , @entity3 wait to hear news of cuts to their welfare state			1
every friday could be a @entity55 , because it 's always friday in @entity3 when cuts and bad news arrives at the cabinet meeting			1
the government recently approved a â ‚ ¬ 10 billion euro ( $ 12 billion ) cut in education and health programs , and will most likely announce it will spend â ‚ ¬ 23 billion ( $ 28 billion ) to rescue @entity5			1
so what do the people think ? according to the @entity67 , the public agency for surveys , prime minister @entity66 has gone from a rate of approval of 45 % in january to 38 % in may -- a significant drop considering he won the elections with an absolute majority only six months ago			0
people , especially youth ( for whom unemployment rates are above 51 % ) , find it difficult to understand there is no money for healthcare or universities , but enough to go around when it comes to rescue banks or pay severance packages to bankers who have ruined their companies			1
up to now , no one has resigned empty handed			0
but not everything is bad news for the government and its party			0
their main competitor , the @entity95 ( @entity96 , center - left ) , trails in the polls			0
although it has won two regional elections this @entity102 ( @entity103 and @entity104 ) , its leader @entity100 generated " little " or " no " confidence among 78.8 % of the @entity3 , according to the latest survey carried out by the @entity67			2
so what happens now ? all the parties in opposition have asked the government to open an inquiry into the @entity5 case			2
it is difficult to justify the billions in cost without knowing exactly what happened			0
meanwhile , summer is on the way			0
in @entity3 , this is the time when political life is paralyzed and tourism boosts job prospects , especially in the coastal towns			2
demonstrations , strikes and protests will probably be forgotten until september			2
while transport prices and university fees rise , and the government increases taxes and lowers pensions , people prefer to stay at home and support @entity134 ( @entity3 national soccer team ) and wait until it is cooler to take the streets			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			0

@entity140 : @entity3 want to know how much money @entity5 needs
as @entity5 sucks up financial aid @entity3 wait to hear news of welfare state cuts
people find it *confusing* that there is no money for healthcare , but enough to rescue banks
people will probably wait until summer is over to resume protests and strikes
