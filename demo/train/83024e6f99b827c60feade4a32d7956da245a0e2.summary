-- @entity2 's warring political factions hardly need red shirts and yellow shirts to identify themselves : a short few hours by road from @entity6 reveals a dramatic shift in culture			1
in central @entity6 , the young and moneyed throng the bars of @entity10 where the men have the well - groomed detachment of the younger @entity13 -- the @entity15 and @entity16 - educated leader of the opposition , whose 2008 - 2011 government launched a violent crackdown on the largely rural @entity20 red - shirt protesters in 2010			1
amid the jazz bars and cool beer gardens of @entity10 , these young @entity22 represent not only an urban and educated middle class but also the money of some of @entity2 's most established families			1
just a few hours to the northeast and the prevailing culture gives way to pick - up trucks , cowboy hats and the whine of electric organ and guitar that comes from " mor lam " music : the @entity2 " up country " version of country and western			2
even the @entity42 , whose image beams from billboards dotted along the highway , is shown in his up country guise wearing the ubiquitous slouch hat favored by @entity2 farmers			2
traditionally the poorest region of @entity2 , @entity50 , in the northeast of the country , accounts for a third of @entity2 's population			1
however , it is rapidly turning from its economic staple of subsistence farming to an economy driven by trade and services			0
booming economy if growth in @entity2 -- @entity64 's second largest economy after @entity65 -- is slowing , in the northeast of the country it 's booming			1
economic growth in the region hit 40 % from 2007 to 2011 , compared with 23 % for the rest of @entity2 over that period and just 17 % for greater @entity6 , according to government figures			1
@entity50 , which once exported people to @entity6 and the rest of the world as cheap migrant labor , is seeing its workers return			2
prime minister @entity79 -- the sister of deposed prime minister @entity80 -- has brought in a raft of policies that ensure @entity80 's populist policies , which included practically free healthcare and low - interest loans , continue to underpin the boom in the red shirt heartland			2
chief among them is a 2.2 trillion baht ( us $ 71 billion ) infrastructure program aimed at the northeast and a nationwide minimum wage of 300 baht ( us $ 10 ) a day			0
in some parts of @entity50 , this boosted household incomes by more than 35 %			0
an expensive rice subsidy , which guarantees farmers 40 % above market price for their crops , that has led to a conservative estimate of losses in the region of 136 billion baht ( $ 4.3 billion ) , has been widely criticized in @entity2 and even recently drew fire from the @entity104 , which urged @entity2 to drop the $ 21 billion scheme			2
sleeping giant as the boom fuels a growing middle class , @entity6 's elite now realizes that it ignores the northeast -- which holds a third of the electorate -- at its peril			1
@entity114 , director at @entity115 a @entity6 - based risk assessment firm , said that while @entity80 's populism has been demonized in @entity6 , it has awoken a sleeping giant in the northeast			1
" there 's this cultural overlay , " @entity114 told @entity0			0
" @entity2 's system has been fairly feudal with the social ascendancy of a small group of historic families in @entity6 lording it over the rest of the country			1
" there 's an attitude that says ' it 's not so wrong to have smart and good people in @entity6 running the entire country '			2
they do n't really want to see one man , one vote			0
" it sort of echoes @entity137 history when women and blacks fought to get their vote			0
the underlying supposition is that these people are n't smart enough to really cast an intelligent vote , they 're prone to corruption , you can buy their vote for $ 5			0
" social revolution he said the advent of social media had also changed the political landscape in @entity2 , giving both sides of the political divide a means of organizing quickly and challenging government			1
" in @entity6 , we saw the so - called ' v for @entity2 ' movement where thousands of people changed their @entity162 pages , " @entity114 said , referring to @entity156 protests in june			1
" but also in the northeast , there 's a robust social media exchange among people			1
" according to @entity167 , professor of political science at @entity169 , the political and socio - economic divide in @entity2 is further complicated by the position of the @entity2 monarchy			1
" in @entity2 , we are seeing the rise of a citizenry that used to be merely loyal subjects , " @entity167 told @entity0			2
" this means that in @entity2 almost all @entity22 are monarchists and democrats at the same time			2
most thais will not reject democracy and they want to protect the monarchy -- they embrace both			0
" however , he said that divisions have emerged in this widely held position			0
" some people will embrace electoral democracy first and foremost ; these are the people that keep voting for the @entity80 party because they feel that it gives them a voice , it gives them rights , it allows their grievances to be expressed and everything else is subservient to that			0
" on the other side you have the anti-government protesters			0
they do n't reject the electoral democracy but they prefer the monarchy - based social and political hierarchy at the top			0
that 's why they keep calling for good people to run a good government to eradicate corruption			0
" he said that the monarchy will be critical to the stable future of @entity2			0
" the monarchy has become the fault line of @entity2 's entrenched polarization and its future , including the succession , is where the battle lines will be drawn			1
" @entity0 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's protests reveal an *increasing* divide between the urban south and the rural north

as @entity2 's economy slows , in the northeast government policies are fueling a boom
*analysts* say the advent of social media had also changed the political landscape in @entity2
