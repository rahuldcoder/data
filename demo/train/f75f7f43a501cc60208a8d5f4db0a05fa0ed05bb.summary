@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's not often that you see the words @entity1 and holidays in the same sentence , but with 10 years of peace behind it , the @entity7 country is now hoping to attract investment to create a booming hospitality industry			1
like many of his countrymen , @entity14 left @entity1 in the late 1990s to seek refuge in the @entity18 during the country 's ruinous civil war			1
the conflict ended in 2003 and when @entity14 returned home two years later , he quickly recognized an opportunity where he could use the business skills he 'd gained abroad			2
" it was evident there was a need to develop the hospitality sector , " says @entity14 , chief executive of the @entity25 hotel and restaurant			2
read this : @entity1 's guns become weapons of mass creation with just a few full - service hotels operating in the country , @entity14 decided to convert his parents ' small house in the capital of @entity0 into a boutique hotel			1
" at that time ... we saw an influx of investors , an influx of @entity44 , but yet still @entity1 did not have the capacity to cater to them , " he says			2
" i think at one point in time ( 2005 , 2006 ) it was stated that @entity1 had not even close to 200 good decent rooms			2
" standing skeletons the civil war left an estimated 250,000 people dead and many more displaced			0
it also destroyed much of @entity1 's economy and infrastructure			1
the country 's hotels were also victims ; to this day , the skeletons of two of @entity1 's biggest hotels -- @entity62 and @entity63 -- still stand , serving as a grim reminder of the impact the war had on the country			1
" before the war , @entity1 had a couple of very good hotels , " says @entity14			2
" in fact , the @entity62 , from what we know , was one of the first five - star hotels in @entity63			0
" high costs political stability over the past decade , coupled with growing government revenues thanks to the mining sector , has allowed for the building of some essential infrastructure			1
yet the re-development is far from complete -- @entity1 's main source of power , its hydroelectric dam , was also shattered during the war , leaving the power situation in the country very unreliable to this day			1
as a result , any business that depends on constant electricity must rely on costly generators			0
" we do not have adequate electricity -- public electricity -- or water supply , " says @entity14 , sitting inside his hotel			0
" it costs me close to $ 10,000 to $ 11,000 a month just to provide electricity for such a small establishment , " he adds			0
read this : holidays in @entity104 , anyone ? with rainforest , sandy beaches and an emerging surf scene , @entity1 has its attractions			2
but it takes more than attractions to create a vibrant tourist destination			0
@entity113 , the @entity1 minister of commerce and industry , admits that entrepreneurs betting on an upward trend in the hospitality industry face many challenges			1
he says that high energy costs and skills shortage make hotels a difficult enterprise to venture into			1
" right now , if an investor wants to build a resort here , they have to build the entire infrastructure , " says @entity123			0
potential for growth this need for self - sustainability is something that @entity133 , general manager of the @entity135 , @entity1 's largest resort just outside @entity0 , knows too well			1
" we have our own water plant , our own sewage plant , our own generators and so on , " says @entity137			0
" so basically we 're fully independent in anything that we are doing			0
" yet @entity133 is optimistic about the progress he sees in @entity1 's development , encouraged by the country 's stable political environment			1
" the potential for growing is there , " he says			0
" the stability of the political situation plays an enormous role because that allows for people to come here and feel comfortable that ' ok , we 're going to spend x amount of millions of dollars in this country but it 's not going to go down south , it will continue to stabilize			0
' there is a potential return investment			0
" read this : the woman fixing @entity1 's water crisis @entity123 agrees that , despite the challenges , there is a reason to be optimistic			1
" this country is a gift , it 's a tourist attraction waiting to happen , " he says			0
" if the energy situation comes under control -- and we 're making investments in energy right now and we 're talking to our partners to see how we can fast track that process -- would then make us more competitive and more attractive for some of these opportunities			0
" back at @entity25 , @entity14 says that he plans to continue expanding his hotel , as well as build another one in the city of @entity186			0
he foresees that the investments he 's making now will pay off down the road , but urges the government to provide support to those entrepreneurs interested in investing in the country			1
" i would like to encourage @entity1 investment into the sector , " he says			1
" but to have that the government needs to provide the incentive to @entity1 enterprises , @entity1 entrepreneurs , who are willing to take such risks			2

the @entity7 nation of @entity1 is *celebrating* 10 years of peace
the country 's hospitality entrepreneurs are trying to *foster* the sector 's growth
insiders say the industry has potential for growth but still faces many *obstacles*
high energy costs and lack of skills are some of the challenges
