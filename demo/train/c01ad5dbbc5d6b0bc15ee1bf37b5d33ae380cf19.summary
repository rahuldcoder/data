@entity1 , @entity0 -- in her first visit to @entity5 , the tech - themed conference underway here , former first daughter @entity3 devoted the bulk of her prepared talk tuesday to the admirable work of her family 's foundation in improving global health care			1
but it was her more personal remarks , often about her famous family 's early use of technology , that seemed to resonate most			1
" i definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones , " she told almost 3,000 people in an @entity1 convention hall			0
" i 'm sure that 's not uncommon for many people in this room			2
" @entity26 , 34 , said she got her first computer , a @entity28 , " from @entity29 " as a child and sent her first e-mail while in high school in the mid- 1990s			1
that was around the time her father , then - president @entity26 , sent the first presidential e-mail , to astronaut @entity36 in space -- a fact she said her dad was " ridiculously " proud of			1
" he 's now a pretty good tweeter and a pretty good texter , but he 's still only sent about two e-mails , " she said			2
she then joked about how her father is not the most famous texter in the family and showed the photo of her mother , wearing sunglasses and wielding a phone , that inspired the " texts from @entity51 " meme			2
wearing jeans and a black jacket , @entity26 gave a rather stiff , scripted 25 - minute speech , followed by a more relaxed q&a session with @entity58 editor @entity57			1
she showed glimmers of both her mother 's poise and her father 's command of detail , rattling off stats about mobile banking usage in @entity67 and the 750,000 children in the world who die each year from dehydration caused by diarrhea			0
" i 'm obsessed with diarrhea , " she said			0
" it does n't make me squeamish			0
" as the only child of two ambitious parents , growing up in the spotlight of the @entity79 governor 's mansion and the @entity80 , @entity26 said a lot was expected of her at a young age			1
at age 6 she said she would debate her parents , one at a time , about issues or current events while the other parent moderated			0
" it taught me that not only was it ok to have an opinion and a point of view , " she said , " it was expected that i would have an opinion and a point of view			0
" asked for the umpteenth time about whether she 'll enter politics , @entity26 demurred , although she left the door open at least a crack			1
" i do n't know , " she said , adding , " for a long time , my answer to that question was no. " she expressed dismay that none of her friends -- most of them smart , accomplished people -- show any interest in running for office			2
" i find that really troubling , " she said , adding that when her father graduated from @entity108 in the 1960s , he said about half his classmates were pondering a future in politics			0
@entity26 did urge the coders , designers and other tech professionals in the audience to devote their careers to making the world a better place			2
tech entrepreneurs can sometimes find quicker solutions to global problems than policy makers , she said			0
asked for her advice to @entity5 attendees pondering careers in social good , she offered this : " i 'd focus on what you 're most passionate about and what makes you angry			1
i 'd ask myself , ' what do i think is really unjust ? ' that should be a starting point for how you engage with the world			0
