-- the death of longtime @entity3 dictator @entity2 is shaking the @entity5 world			1
and nations like @entity7 , which next month holds its first parliamentary elections since the fall of president @entity10 in february , are watching			2
@entity7 , like @entity11 -- which holds elections this weekend -- needs a great many positive influences to consolidate its nascent democratic government			1
if @entity3 's @entity15 should turn in a militant @entity17 direction and become hostile to the @entity18 or the @entity19 , it could jeopardize democratic progress in @entity21 and @entity22 alike			1
@entity7 's position is precarious enough as it is			1
two weeks ago in @entity22 , for example , @entity25 protesters clashed with security forces , leaving 25 dead and more than 300 injured			0
the violence stems from the @entity30 ' refusal to share key decision - making powers with civilians and tests its ability to manage the country 's fragile political transition			1
today in @entity7 , no political faction is strong enough to monopolize power and none is weak enough to be ground out of existence			1
as a result , the army 's failure to build a solid political consensus creates a recipe for ongoing confrontation			2
as long as @entity7 believe they stand to gain more through violence than peaceful political negotiations , the situation in @entity22 will worsen			2
three decades ago , after the @entity50 in @entity51 , the @entity49 wasted no time in enacting a brutal purge of the country 's secular military elites , whom he feared would endanger his rule			2
in refusing to establish a new order that @entity7 's most powerful political constituencies can all get behind , the @entity7 army may now be leading itself in the same direction			1
the army 's stubbornness in refusing to craft a new constitution before holding elections at the end of november is ill - considered and dangerous			0
the coming parliament will be charged with choosing 100 experts to draft the new constitution			0
but @entity69 and secularists fear that an @entity17 - dominated parliament will produce a constitution that discriminates against them			0
having had little more than six months of freedom , most @entity7 political parties are still in their infancy , and the older secular parties are not yet ready for elections			2
@entity17 parties are the best prepared , as they have been well funded , are known across the country and have enjoyed most of the coverage in the state - owned media since the fall of @entity10			0
yet secularists -- who constitute 70 % or perhaps 80 % of @entity7 's political parties -- asked for more time to prepare for elections and for the military to facilitate an agreement on a bill of rights that sets down guiding principles for the new constitution			1
islamists oppose such a move , as they fear it would create rules the secularists could use to oppress them			0
as a provisional government , the army must create a new political framework that guarantees majority rule while protecting the rights of religious , ethnic and political minorities			1
yet in spite of a worsening domestic situation , the military shows no such desire			0
after @entity10 's fall , @entity7 hoped the army would be the guarantor of a democratic transition ; that it would do this transparently , sharing power with civilian political groups , and presiding over a convention culminating in a modern , democratic constitution that protects every @entity7 individual and political group that rejects violence			1
in late july , the @entity30 sent a worrisome signal when it celebrated @entity116 , the anniversary of the 1952 coup d'etat in which the military took power			0
this coup smothered @entity7 's nascent democratic process in its cradle and ushered in an era of military rule lasting almost six decades			1
after the coup , military men in civilian attire rigged every election , abused human rights and monopolized the political system			2
in years past , @entity116 was nothing out of the ordinary -- the country had celebrated it every year for almost six decades -- but this year , it signaled the military 's intention to backpedal on political reforms and maintain an undemocratic status quo			2
the 1952 regime has hidden behind many different ideologies and adopted a range of different national and international alliances to suit its needs			0
it began as a capitalist government , allied with the @entity146 , turned to @entity147 and became socialist in the 1960s , then adopted a mixture of socialism and capitalism in the late ' 70s , and allied itself with @entity152			0
yet in no incarnation was the military - backed regime ever democratic			0
until @entity7 's rulers reject the order established in the 1952 military coup , the country will never move forward toward genuine democracy			1
ongoing protests and rising violence are not a coincidence			0
they are the fruits of 60 years of failed policies			0
if @entity7 could be confident in their political futures -- that they would be subject to the rule of law rather than the rule of man -- they would be less frustrated			1
if they could be sure that the country 's new political order would respect their individual rights and liberties , they would no longer be in the streets			2
if a new constitution ensured that @entity181 , @entity69 , secularists , men and women alike all enjoyed equal rights , then maybe violence and protests would not be the way to be heard			0
if the @entity30 respected its mandate to establish the rules of the game , and then shared power with political parties , @entity7 would be confident that it sought only to preserve rule of law and public order , not to perpetuate its own rule			1
@entity7 military elites can take comfort that they will not meet the same end as @entity2 , nor that of the @entity51 military after the fall of the shah			1
but they should take the latest violence very seriously , as they are in a far more delicate position than they may realize			0
they can not continue to manage the country 's transition the way that they have			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity215 : @entity2 's death has *resonated* in @entity219 countries like @entity7 , @entity11
he says @entity7 's transition to democracy has been rough ; how @entity3 proceeds matters
he says @entity7 's military rulers are **n't** managing factions in transition ; this is **n't** *encouraging*
@entity230 : @entity231 must make political framework that ensures majority rule , backs minorities ' rights
