-- rail experts tuesday questioned the effectiveness of one step being taken by @entity5 's @entity4 to ensure safety one week after the derailment of a speeding commuter train killed four people and injured dozens of others			1
the @entity11 , which operates the railroad , said late sunday that " alerter " systems -- which require engineers to respond to alerts , sound an alarm if they are unresponsive and eventually brake the train in an emergency -- will be installed in every operator cab within the next year			1
currently , such systems in the engineer 's position are present in two - thirds of the railroad 's fleet			2
the @entity28 line train that derailed on december 1 had an alerter system in the engine car at the rear but not in the front cab , where the engineer apparently nodded off at the controls as the train approached a curve at 82 miles per hour			1
the engineer 's lawyer and union representatives said the train 's hypnotic motion may have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed " highway hypnosis			2
" man vs. machine : who should be at the wheel ? @entity49 , a @entity50 professor and expert on railway operations , said the effectiveness of " alerter " systems is debatable			1
" it 's not the cure all for all problems , " he told @entity0			2
" research has been done showing that some crews are adapting to these ' alerters ' and they 're still sleeping to the ' alerters			1
' it 's that whole highway hypnosis thing			0
" a 2007 study of " alerter " technology by @entity64 said , " engineers can become inattentive and keep hitting the alerter even when nodding off			1
' @entity67 ' has become a commonly used term			0
" the study cited a 2006 @entity71 investigation report on a freight train collision in @entity73 , @entity74 , in which escaping liquified chlorine ultimately killed the conductor and two local residents			0
the study said the engineer experienced what it called " alerter naps " in which he " apparently drifted in and out of micro-sleep			1
" " i view the alerter devices as being only partially effective , " @entity82 , a former @entity83 official who teaches at @entity84 , said in an e-mail			1
" during my years in the railroad industry , there have been numerous occasions when locomotive engineers have responded to alerter alarms while being in less than a fully conscious state			2
" while two - thirds of @entity4 's operating fleet is equipped with alerters in the engineer 's position , the remaining one - third is equipped with " dead man " controls , another safety measure which theoretically requires the conductor make continuous conscious input to keep the train running			1
at the time of the accident , the train was in " push mode , " meaning that the locomotive was in the rear of the train pushing it along the tracks , with engineer @entity113 in a cabin at the front operating it remotely			0
his cabin was equipped with a " dead man pedal " that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving , the @entity11 has said			0
the dead man pedal was working properly , authorities said			2
the newer model locomotive in the rear , however , was equipped with an alerter system which sounds a tone every 25 seconds , requiring the engineer to respond with a tap within 15 seconds while the train is in steady motion			1
late sunday , the @entity11 said it was taking additional safety measures : signal crews installed new protections at the bend near the @entity138 station in the @entity139 -- where the fatal derailment occurred -- to warn engineers of the speed reduction and automatically apply emergency brakes if speed is not lowered to 30 mph			0
by tuesday morning , the @entity11 said , @entity4 also enhanced communication between engineers and conductors to ensure trains are operated at safe speeds at four other critical curves and five movable bridges			1
conductors will stand with engineers at the control cab through the critical curves or they will communicate by radio			2
on monday , the @entity71 continued to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly crash while adding to the possibility that human error was involved			0
the @entity71 said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies			0
the board found no problems with speed sensors , the brake control unit or the train 's propulsion controller			0
at 7:11 a.m. that sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train 's headlights as required when it passed another train , the @entity71 said monday			0
it also said it believes that positive train control , a costly , high - tech system that targets human error , could have prevented the crash			0
the safety board has pushed the system for about 20 years			0
@entity181 is requiring most major railroads , including @entity4 , to install the costly systems by the end of 2015			1
@entity185 , an instructor at the @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity188 , advocates putting another person in the engineer 's cab of commuter trains , a practice that is common in freight trains and airplane cockpits			1
" it will increase the cost , of course , but the alternative that the railroads are looking at , and the federal government is trying to force on the railroads , positive train control , is certainly much more costly , " @entity185 told @entity0			0
" we 're into the hundreds of millions of dollars right now and we have n't even had the implementation of that system			0
... the problem here is that we are dealing with humans in the cabs of those locomotives and we have frailties			2

rail experts question a step taken to make trains safer after @entity4 wreck
authorities are requiring " alerters " in every operator cab by end of 2015
expert : " alerter devices ... only partially effective "
