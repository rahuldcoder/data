@entity0 -- the new @entity3 movement deemed its official kickoff saturday a " huge success , " with dozens of talks held at coast - to - coast coffee shops as members came together to discuss the issues most important to them			1
billed by many as an answer to the conservative @entity13 movement , the @entity3 was born on @entity14 just six weeks ago			1
while the group has become an instant hit online -- it boasts more than 141,000 @entity14 fans as of saturday -- gauging the success of this weekend 's coffee meetups was predicted to be an indicator of the group 's strength			1
a statement released by the party said " today 's coffee houses have been a huge success -- both for @entity3 and for democracy			1
all across the @entity29 , @entity29 from all political sides sat down for civil conversation and , of course , coffee			0
" at @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , a suburb of @entity38 , coordinator @entity34 said turnout far exceeded expectations , with around 60 people participating at the " very productive " meeting where health care reform was the overriding issue			0
" we had kids there , we had college students , high school students , and we had retirees , " she said			0
" it went across a very broad spectrum age wise and racially , and this is that we 'd like to see			0
" were you at a @entity3 gathering ? share your images , story in @entity58 , @entity59 , about 35 people gathered at @entity60 , according to @entity61 , a stay - at - home mom who coordinated the meeting			1
" i think the biggest thing to come out of it was people were tired of being labeled and divided , " said @entity61 , who added that a @entity13 member was among the attendees			0
" they do agree on a lot			0
" about 30 people came out to a meeting at @entity72 , @entity59 's @entity73 , said @entity74			2
" i really liked what the coffee movement said the foundation was -- which is to get everybody of all stripes of life to get together , " @entity75 said			0
the meetings were among about 350 the party planned to hold saturday			1
@entity3 founder @entity84 , who worked as a volunteer for @entity87 's presidential campaign and @entity89 sen. @entity88 of @entity91 's 2006 campaign , says the group is not " aligned " with any party and calls the two - party system out of date			1
@entity96 said the bitter battle over health care is an example of how government is not working			0
" we feel like the health care debate showed not only that we are a very divided country , but there 's something really wrong with our political process			1
we kind of got to see the innards of the political process and realize there 's something very broken			2
i think that 's what we 're responding to			2
" the party statement said the next step " is to dig into what our community discussed ( and ) find out what matters most to them			0
" @entity96 said the @entity3 's first real national action will be march 27 , when members will get together to discuss ways to engage members of @entity123 during the @entity125 recess			1
" just like in the @entity126 , we are looking for real representation right now			1
we do n't feel represented by our government right now , and we do n't really feel represented well by the media either , " @entity96 said last week on @entity1 's " @entity128			2
" " it 's kind of a simple call to action for people to wake up and take control over their future and demand representation			1
and it requires people standing up and speaking up			0
" sound familiar ? @entity13 activists use much of the same language in describing their year - old protest movement that 's steeped in fiscal conservatism and boiling - hot , anti-tax rhetoric			2
" it 's a response to how they are trying to change our government , " @entity96 told @entity1 , referring to the @entity13			2
" it 's their methodology that we are against			2
we may want some of the same things , but their journey is so alienating to us			0
" so what does the @entity13 movement think of this new sensation ? " this @entity3 looks like a weak attempt at satire or a manufactured response to a legitimate widespread grassroots movement , " says @entity156 , director of federal and state campaigns for @entity158 , a nonprofit conservative organization that helps train volunteer activists and has provided much of the organizational heft behind the @entity13 movement			1
" it 's driven from the top down and it 's not a grass - roots movement driven from the bottom up , " @entity165 of the @entity166 @entity13 said			0
@entity1 deputy political director @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
