@entity0 -- a tiny nano - sized car which can propel itself forward in response to electrical pulses has been created by scientists in the @entity6			1
the electric - powered vehicle , which is the size of a single molecule , has a chassis and four paddle - shaped wheels and is roughly one - billionth the size of a traditional hatchback car			1
its maiden journey was n't exactly epic -- six nanometers -- and its fuel - efficiency was n't world - beating either , needing a jolt of 500 millivolts every half revolution of its wheels			1
but it 's an important milestone in nanotech research ( the science of manipulating matter at molecular scale ) , say scientists , because it demonstrates that single molecules can absorb external electrical energy and turn this into targeted motion			2
" to build the nanotechnology of the future like nanorobots , machines and transporters you need something to fuel it			1
so there is a great incentive to build motors at the nanoscale , " said @entity36 , professor of organic chemistry at the @entity38 , and one of the authors of the research			0
" there are many nanosystems built from all kinds of materials , but this is , as far as we can tell , the first time a nanomotor has been used to propel something by fueling it			0
" the fuel in this instance came from a scanning tunnelling microscope ( @entity58 ) with its atom - sized stylus acting as an electrode allowing electricity to flow from its tip to the surface beneath it , @entity36 says			2
" when there is a molecule , the current goes through it and electricity excites the motor which drives the car forward , " @entity36 said			1
the discovery , say scientists , takes them a step closer to understanding and ultimately mimicking nature 's highly efficient molecular robots			2
" in living cells there are a whole variety of molecule motors that are involved in almost every important biological process like cell division and transport , and mobility in our muscles , " @entity36 said			0
the world 's smallest synthetic motor was created by @entity91 , professor of physics at @entity93 in 2003 while the first nano car ( without a motor ) was built by @entity96 in 2005			1
" the @entity102 team is to be congratulated for their excellent work , " said @entity97 , a professor of chemistry at @entity99 , @entity100			0
" it will certainly propel the field to a higher level of sophistication with the eventual goal of synthetic molecular machines being used for controlled transport and ex vivo ( in an artificial environment outside an organism ) bottom - up assembly ... " he added			0
but it 's still early days and @entity36 says he feels a bit like the @entity117 , likening the nano car to their " fairly awkward - looking primitive plane " when compared to the passenger jets of today			1
" it 's very difficult to know where the future will go and ultimately the systems will be different			2
but first you have to find the fundamental principles			0
that makes things possible , " he said			0
the research , which was completed in conjunction with scientists from the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) is published in the journal @entity136 .			0

@entity6 scientists create the smallest vehicle in the world
nano car is the first to be powered by electricity
car traveled a *distance* of six nano meters
scientists hope nanomotors will power nanorobots of the future
