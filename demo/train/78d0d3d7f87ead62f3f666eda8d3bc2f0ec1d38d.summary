-- they say in @entity2 that football is second only to breathing in importance			1
on tuesday , 200 million people in the @entity7 host nation had their breath stolen away from them in a dazzling , dizzying display of scoring by the no. 2 team in the world , @entity13			1
no one could have predicted a 7 - 1 scoreline			0
that 's something from qualifying when a big fish hosts a minnow			0
it 's not the result of a match between the top powers of the sport			0
here 's a look at some of the record - setting numbers that came from the rout of all routs : 1			0
they were in it -- for 10 minutes you 'd have to be almost 100 years old to have been in attendance for the last time @entity2 was thumped this badly			1
at least we think it was @entity2			1
it certainly did n't look like the product of a nation that has won five @entity40			2
the funny thing is @entity2 was pretty good for the first 10 minutes			1
they pressed the @entity13 , mostly kept the ball in the @entity13 half			1
but @entity13 scored in the 11th minute when @entity45 was left so alone he could have set up a grill in the penalty area and made steaks for everyone			1
and then the @entity13 made a meal of the @entity52 defense , stuck in first gear , while the @entity13 were zipping both ball and strikers artfully through the confused @entity52			1
a tearful @entity56 apologized to his countrymen			0
" i just wanted to see my people smile			0
we all know how important it was for me to see all of @entity2 be happy , at least because of football , " the defender said			1
step aside , @entity63 it was a triple disappointment for @entity2 on tuesday			2
not only was the @entity2 beaten badly , but famed goal scorer @entity63 was bumped off the top of the all - time @entity7 goal scoring list			1
@entity13 striker @entity67 scored his team 's second goal , giving him 16 in @entity7 matches , one more than @entity63			1
" if you 've scored the most goals in the history of the @entity7 , you 've had to earn it			0
he 's still playing at the highest level and scoring goals , " @entity13 coach @entity75 said			2
a more inexperienced player might not have scored			0
@entity67 's first shot was saved by a sprawling @entity2 keeper			2
the 36 - year - old pounced on the rebound and knocked it into the goal			2
and there was more disappointment			0
@entity13 now also lays claim to most goals by one nation in its @entity7 history -- 223			1
in second , @entity2 at 220			2
that sure did escalate quickly @entity2 survived the first knockdown			2
but like a boxer sensing he can knock his opponent out with a flurry of well - targeted body blows , @entity13 unleashed hell on @entity2 midway through the first half			1
it was 5 - 0 before the first half hour			0
@entity13 scored a quartet in six minutes			1
you do n't even do that in training			0
" we could n't react to going behind			0
we got disorganized and panicked after the first goal and then it all went wrong for us , " @entity2 coach @entity110 said			1
where 's the defense ? you think semifinal , and you imagine two teams playing cautiously , worried to give up a first goal that would doom them			2
of the previous six semifinals , four of them had ended 1 - 0			0
another was 0 - 0 after 90 minutes and did n't see a goal until minute 119			1
they went forward with spirit and it ended with a scoreline from the early days of the @entity7			0
@entity13 appeared content to cruise after holding a 5 - 0 halftime lead , but the @entity52 defense was so lame , the @entity131 went ahead and sent two more in to claim another couple of records			1
they became the first team to score seven goals in a semifinal and to hold the largest margin of victory in such a game			0
by the way , you guys get one more do n't pack away the boots just yet , lads			0
you still have to play in everyone 's ( very least ) favorite contest -- the third - place match			0
what do you get if you win that , a gift certificate for dinner for two at @entity154 's best steakhouse ? can you imagine what the scene will be like if @entity157 loses to the @entity158 and has to play its archrival in what is usually meaningless match ? @entity163 , we 'd even watch this game for a change .			0

@entity2 was feeling pretty good after 10 minutes
then the defense *faltered* and let in a goal
that was n't so *terrible* -- until things really fell apart just a few minutes later
@entity13 set many records and broke many @entity52 hearts
