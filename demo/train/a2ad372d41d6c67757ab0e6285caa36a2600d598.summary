@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , @entity4 and 29 other @entity6 college students are going to be late for class			1
but it 's all right with the professors			2
@entity3 said she had just two days off during the @entity10			0
she gets a rare break as @entity12 plays			0
the @entity14 journalism students are in @entity0 for a few more days , working as volunteers at the sports venues and the media compounds			1
back in @entity19 , classes have already begun , so the students at the @entity21 will have to play catch - up once they get back			1
there will be no time to sleep for a few days to get over the jet lag			0
it 's straight back to class			0
@entity3 , a senior , has been in @entity0 since july 6 as part of a group of international students who cover games and practices to get quotes for the @entity33			1
the @entity33 translates the interviews into several different languages and sends out " flash quote " sheets soon after an event ends			1
many of the 30,000 journalists covering the @entity10 ( including this one ) use them in their reports			0
it is the first time that an @entity21 committee has used @entity33 reporters from outside the @entity10 ' host country			1
@entity3 has worked at the basketball venue , which seems to be a natural fit for a @entity14 student			1
but she said she has n't done any sports reporting in the past and really does n't know much about basketball			1
so it was a steep learning curve , getting into the scrum with the other reporters , shouting questions to hulking figures , some of whom did n't always recognize the language of the question or pretended not to understand			1
" i think the best thing i have gained through this experience is confidence , " she said one day in the lobby of the students ' hotel			1
" it 's really hard for me to approach people			1
doing this has given me a lot of confidence to just go in there , be professional and do what i have to do			2
" not all the students get to work as reporters			2
@entity4 , who is in her first year as a graduate student , has been volunteering as a rental space assistant in the main media center at the office of the @entity80 news agency @entity79			1
she had applied to be a sports reporter , but her language skills -- she is one of a few students fluent in @entity80 -- seemed to work against her , and she was assigned to the @entity79 newsroom			1
@entity4 has tried to keep a positive spin on the assignment , even though " what i am actually doing is not the highlight of my trip			0
" she has used the day - to - day interaction with the @entity79 staff to meet reporters and talk to them about their jobs to learn more and help her confirm that she wants to work for an international news agency			2
" i 'm really happy to get to observe everything in the [ @entity99 ] , " @entity4 said one day last week at the @entity97 cafeteria			0
" and it 's been amazing the access that i have had to the @entity21			0
the magnitude of everything here is amazing			0
" she said she signed up for the trip primarily to go to @entity0 , which had been on her list of places to visit			0
the chance to see the @entity21 was a close second			0
neither she nor @entity3 had been to @entity113 before , so this trip was as much about seeing and learning about a new culture as it was about learning the nuances of sports reporting			1
there was a little culture shock , especially when it came to riding the city transportation to work			2
" the @entity1 do n't have the same concept of personal space as @entity123 , " @entity3 said			1
" they 're not trying to be rude ; it 's just their culture			2
" @entity4 echoed her classmate 's comments about the crowded transportation and streets , and added there were some initial language barriers , particularly in cabs			2
@entity0 officials made a big deal about how many drivers had learned @entity136 , but other than a warm greeting ( " welcome to @entity1 ! " ) there can be some difficulty getting where you want to go			1
fortunately , there are some markets , restaurants and nightclubs nearby , including a pizza place run by a @entity123 expatriate that feels like home			0
it serves good slices and cheap beer and is a favorite gathering spot for @entity123			0
the @entity154 has organized cultural excursions , too			0
there were the requisite trips to the @entity158 , the @entity159 and @entity160			0
there was also a night of watching the national acrobatic company			0
but @entity4 said she also liked venturing out near the hotel to the hutongs -- neighborhoods characterized by narrow streets and alleys -- and witnessing the lives of the locals			0
however , when the @entity10 started , life became dominated by work			0
the students , who paid $ 600 and airfare for the course , will leave @entity1 with memories they say have topped any experience they have had yet			1
what will they remember most , other that the work ? the people , they said " they are very giving and kind people			2
they go completely out of their way to help you , " @entity3 said .			2

*31* @entity14 journalism students volunteer at @entity33 sports venues , media compounds
two of them say experience raised confidence , helped confirm *career* choice
they also learned about culture , endured crowds , dealt with language barrier
one student : @entity1 people went " completely out of their way to help you "
