-- first - time masters champion @entity1 admits he 's still learning to control his emotions after a miraculous win left him bawling on the green			1
" i 'm just trying to figure out ways to calm down , to breathe differently to control me and keep me calm , " the @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity6 after sunday 's dramatic playoff win at @entity8			1
" i 'm putting my head down between holes , not because i 'm mad or disappointed , it 's just because i 'm trying to stay focused			0
" if the crowd 's cheering and i 'm looking at them and talking , then i get so pumped up			0
the ball could go anywhere because i 've got so much adrenalin pumping through my veins			0
" it was the first major tournament win for @entity1 , who lost in a playoff at the @entity22 in 2010			1
he became the 14th different winner in the last 14 major tournaments			2
after a miraculous escape out of woods to the right of the 10th fairway on the second hole of the playoff against @entity31 on sunday , @entity1 burst into tears			1
it was an emotional moment for the 33 - year - old , who just two weeks ago adopted a baby boy , @entity35 , with his wife			1
@entity1 's mother was the first person to greet him on the 10th hole , and he held her tight , crying on her shoulder			1
his father died right after @entity1 played in the losing @entity5 team at the @entity43			1
@entity1 was more than 165 yards from the flag , his ball resting uncomfortably on pine needles following a wayward drive			1
but that did n't stop him hitting a hook shot 40 yards right , the ball rising 15 feet above the ground to sail through a small opening in the trees			2
the ball landed 10 feet from the hole , leaving @entity1 with two putts for the win after his @entity59 opponent had bogeyed			1
the left - hander admitted relying heavily on his caddie for support during the astonishing shot			1
" my caddie told me all the time , ' you 're a good golfer			2
you 're here for a reason			0
you 've done this all before			0
you just have to do it at this moment			0
' that 's the thing ; we 've all hit these shots , it 's just doing it at this moment			0
that 's the trick , " he said			0
@entity1 is now hoping the victory will pave the way for more major wins			1
" as an athlete , as a golfer , this is the @entity85			0
this is what we strove for : to put on the green jackets , " he said			2
" as of less than two years ago , i did n't have a win			2
now i 've got four			0
my dream has always been to have 10 wins			0
" @entity31 , 29 , had rocketed into the lead when he holed his second shot at the par - five second hole for only the fourth albatross in the history of the masters			1
however , in the end , the 2010 @entity100 champion was no match for @entity1			1
" that was my first double eagle ( albatross ) ever , and to do it in a spot like @entity8 , that 's special , " he said			0
" i felt it was tough over the next four or five holes , but then when we turned , i felt very relaxed			0
i made a few great saves			0
i probably did very well to get in the playoff			2
