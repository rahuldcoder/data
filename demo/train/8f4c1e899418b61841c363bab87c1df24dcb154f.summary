-- even if @entity5 competes at the @entity6 in @entity7 in february , what kind of form will the four - time @entity2 overall champion be in ? @entity5 missed a gate in a downhill in @entity10 , @entity11 on saturday -- with boyfriend @entity12 watching -- and then said her ailing right knee was to blame			1
she was seeking to become just the second woman -- behind @entity17 's @entity16 -- to win 60 @entity2 races			2
" i did n't hurt myself more than i 'm already hurt , " the @entity19 told reporters			0
" unfortunately i have no ( anterior cruciate ligament ) and it gave out on me			0
" my knee is loose and it 's not stable and that 's the way it 's going to be from here on out			0
i just have to get used to it			0
" the reigning @entity6 and @entity2 downhill champ hurt the knee at the world championships last february -- she subsequently underwent reconstructive surgery -- and aggravated the problem in a crash in training last month			1
but @entity5 made a quick recovery and placed fifth in a super-g in @entity37 , @entity38 before deciding to skip last week 's races in @entity40 , @entity41			1
" it 's certainly not the return i had anticipated , " @entity5 said			1
" it was @entity12 's first time on a @entity2 race and i was really hoping to win my 60th as a present for him			2
" @entity5 added she would probably only race once or twice more prior to the @entity6 in @entity49			1
" i just need to be more careful of how many races i do , " she said			0
" i 'm at risk of doing more damage to my knee and my meniscus			0
so i 'm going to play it safe and race really minimal races			2
" @entity57 of @entity41 earned a maiden @entity2 victory , beating @entity60 's @entity59 by 0.29 seconds and @entity17 's @entity61 by 0.50 seconds			1
@entity62 trails @entity64 's @entity63 by six points in the downhill standings			2
oh , @entity38 @entity67 has had knee problems of his own -- undergoing surgery in august -- but the @entity38 was the fastest in the 50th running of the downhill in @entity72 , @entity73			1
he bettered @entity75 's @entity74 by 0.12 seconds and @entity11 's @entity76 by 0.24 seconds to claim a fourth @entity2 win			1
@entity75 's @entity78 , the current overall leader , and former overall champion @entity80 of the @entity19 were fourth and fifth , respectively			0
@entity78 also leads the downhill standings through three races .			0

@entity5 misses a gate and ca n't complete a downhill in @entity10 , @entity11
@entity5 says she is still injured and will likely only take part in one or two races before the @entity6
@entity57 won the race ahead of @entity59
@entity38 's @entity67 wins a men 's downhill in @entity72 , one of the *classics*
