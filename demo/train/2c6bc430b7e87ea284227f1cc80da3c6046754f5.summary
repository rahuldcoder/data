-- the convicted rapist arrested last week in @entity2 , @entity3 , after 34 years on the lam was a quiet , laid - back , hardworking , sweet young man whose lurch into violent behavior in his last year of high school remains a puzzle , according to a childhood friend			1
in the winter of 1976 , when @entity13 was nearly 12 years old , her family moved into a modest two - story house on @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , a half hour south of @entity18 , she told @entity0			1
the next spring , the @entity20 family bought the house next door , she said			1
her new neighbors were @entity24 , who was then 16 , his 11 - year - old brother , @entity26 , and their parents , @entity28 and @entity29			2
soon thereafter , @entity24 befriended his younger neighbor , a slim redhead with bangs , braces and glasses			2
the blond , 6 - foot @entity20 enrolled in @entity35 , where he got good grades even as he held a part - time job at a supermarket , played trombone in the school band , listened to disco on a sound system he set up -- complete with strobe lights -- in his attic and made plans to go to college , said @entity46			1
that promising high school student became the 52 - year - old fugitive arrested last week in southern @entity3 , accused of skipping bail after his conviction in the rapes of three women in @entity17 in 1978			1
despite the four - year age difference , " we were very close friends -- too young to be boyfriend and girlfriend , but spent that amount of time together , " @entity46 recalled in a telephone interview			1
they listened to @entity62 's " @entity61 " and became close , she said			1
although the relationship did not include sex , it did include " probably more than should have gone on between a 13 - year - old and a 17 - year - old			2
" but the friendship ended abruptly in the spring of 1978			1
" he all of a sudden got a very violent thing going , " @entity46 said			1
" @entity26 told me @entity24 had gone after his mother with a knife			2
" @entity46 said she confronted @entity20 , who did not deny the account			1
" he was angry , " she said			2
" all of a sudden he was one angry teenager			1
" that was enough for @entity46 to end the friendship			2
" i told him , ' get away from me , i do n't want to talk to you any more			2
' " @entity20 did not return a call from @entity0 , nor did his mother , @entity80			1
that night or the next morning , @entity81 drove his mother 's car through his family 's garage door , @entity46 said			1
" whether he was mad at me or her , i do n't know			2
i did n't talk to him again			2
" that summer , @entity46 's mother showed her an article in the local newspaper about @entity20			1
" do you know what rape is ? " she asked her daughter			1
@entity20 was being tried on three separate counts of rape with force , unnatural acts and kidnapping			1
in one case , he was accused of knocking a victim from her bike and taking her to a secluded area , where he raped her repeatedly			2
in another , he was accused of raping a woman after threatening her with a knife			2
during the trial , @entity46 saw him one last time			2
" i was with my sister ; he was with @entity26 , " she recalled			2
" we were walking in opposite directions , and my sister and i crossed the street to avoid him			2
" no one said anything			0
soon after , a 12 - member jury in @entity117 found @entity20 guilty on the counts			1
the judge -- new to the job -- offered him a weekend to put his affairs in order before reporting to jail			0
instead , @entity20 , facing a possible sentence of life in prison , fled and landed on @entity17 ' most - wanted list			1
his parents , whose family now included a younger son with @entity131 , were struggling , @entity46 said			0
they moved out of the house on @entity15 , and it was left vacant for months , then sold			0
in the years since , @entity46 said , she has never figured out what caused @entity20 to change			1
" some time in there , he lost it			0
he was not like that			0
" now 48 and working as a technical writer , a reporter for a local paper and the owner of a pet supply shop , @entity46 said she has never forgotten her former neighbor			0
" i 've expected him to jump out around a corner , " she said			0
in february 2012 , after the arrest of alleged mobster @entity154 after 16 years on the run , members of the @entity17 state police 's fugitive task force and the @entity151 met with @entity46 to see whether @entity155 , too , could be located			1
" they were trying to develop a picture of who this was back then in order to figure out where he would have been drawn			0
" it turns out he had been drawn just 129 miles north , to @entity2 , @entity3			0
that 's where , on wednesday night , police and the @entity151 arrested @entity20 as he , his wife and their grandchild were watching television			1
" he requested to know how we found him , " @entity168 sgt. @entity167 told reporters			0
@entity167 would not divulge what led authorities to @entity155			0
on the front of the house on @entity176 , a sign reads " @entity20			1
" police said @entity81 had been living as @entity20 , the name of his younger brother			1
records show he had lived there since 2002 and perhaps since the mid- 1980s , police said			0
confirmation of his identity was made via a scar on his chest from heart surgery he underwent as a child and a fingerprint match , police said			0
investigators found guns in the house , police said			0
as a felon , @entity20 was not allowed to possess the guns , and he will be charged by federal authorities on firearms offenses , @entity196 spokesman @entity195 said			1
when he showed up in court on friday , dressed in a yellow jumpsuit with his wrists cuffed in front of him , @entity81 looked little like his most wanted poster , which showed 1978 a picture of him clean - shaven			1
in court , his hair was tied into a ponytail , his beard was bushy , and both were flecked with gray			0
but one thing had not changed			1
" i 'd know those eyes anywhere , " @entity46 said after looking at television accounts of her former friend			0
" those are the eyes			0
" he was taken to @entity220 in @entity221 as a fugitive from justice , this time without bail			0
" i can tell you that his wife appeared like she was in a state of shock , " @entity167 said			0
neighbors in @entity2 , a town of 16,000 residents , also expressed shock that the house with the swing set outside had been home for years to one of @entity17 ' most - wanted fugitives			1
" everybody 's quite amazed at what took place here , " said @entity237 , who has lived for 28 years on @entity176 , four houses down and across the street from the @entity240			1
" it was kinda strange that nobody picked up on this			0
" the @entity247 apparently did take pains to keep out of the public eye			0
" their windows were always closed ; they always had sheets over their windows , " said neighbor @entity250			0
" they kept to themselves so much that we never saw them , we never knew who they were			0
" " he was always pleasant and nice , " neighbor @entity261 said			0
" you never know who 's living next door , i guess			0
" " we really are just starting to understand and know who this guy is , " @entity168 lt. @entity266 said			0
" they 're going to want to know everything about him that has happened since 1978			2
" police said they are planning to see whether they can link @entity155 to any unsolved rapes in the area			0
his house , on a main street into town , is about a quarter - mile away from three public schools and less than a mile from the @entity278			0
some 60 % of the 1,200 students who live on campus are women , a school spokesman said			0
@entity46 said she plans to visit her former friend in prison to ask him about his transformation 34 years ago : " what happened to you ? what were you thinking ? how did you get so angry ? " she said she will ask .			1

@entity81 and @entity13 " were very close friends " in the 1970s , she says
@entity20 was a good student when " he all of a sudden got a very violent thing going , " she recalls
@entity20 was convicted of rape in 1978 and arrested wednesday after 34 years on the lam
