@entity0 -- the deaths of two @entity4 journalists wednesday in @entity5 -- where at least three other journalists have been killed in covering the uprising -- highlight the danger reporters face in covering conflict zones			1
@entity10 , a longtime @entity11 foreign correspondent for @entity0 's @entity12 , and prize - winning war photographer @entity13 , 28 , were killed in shelling in the city of @entity16 , the besieged center of resistance to president @entity19 's regime			1
colleagues remembered @entity21 , 56 , who lost her left eye to shrapnel while covering a conflict in @entity25 , as " a legend " and " a class act			1
" @entity13 had covered conflicts from @entity29 to @entity30 , and he won first prize in the 2011 @entity33 general news category for a photograph of a rebel fighter resting in front of a rebel flag in the war - torn landscape of @entity30 's @entity40			1
the @entity41 demanded that @entity5 give the @entity43 access to @entity16 to remove the journalists ' bodies			1
" this shows how much the freedom to inform is important , how the work of a journalist can be so difficult , " @entity47 president @entity46 said wednesday			1
" i want to pay tribute to them because if reporters were not over there , we would not know what is going on			2
" at least one other journalist , photographer @entity58 , was wounded in the attack , @entity12 said , adding that initial reports suggest his wounds are not serious			1
the two journalists ' deaths come less than a week after @entity65 reporter @entity64 , a two - time @entity66 winner , died in @entity5 apparently of an asthma attack			1
@entity21 's legacy is to " live a passionate and important life as you see it , " her mother , @entity68 , told @entity1			1
" do what you 're committed to , to the highest level you can do it -- because that 's what she always did			2
overcome the obstacles that you meet as best you can			0
" @entity79 said she never told her daughter to stop doing her work because " it was the most useless conversation you could have had			0
... from the time she was a little child , she was committed to doing things that were important			0
" " she was a ferocious correspondent , and ferociously funny , " said @entity1 's @entity85			0
" i just loved spending hours with her talking about the people , the places and the stories			2
" the emergencies director for @entity92 , @entity93 , called @entity21 " a legend among her fellows			1
she was always the first one to show up -- long before anybody else would arrive , and she really had a passion to report from these difficult places			0
" @entity93 said @entity21 had contacted him tuesday about a story she had written for @entity12 , which requires readers to pay before gaining access to the website			1
" she said , ' please , put my story ... over the pay wall , and i will face the firing squad tomorrow at the paper			0
i do n't often do this , but it is sickening what is happening here			0
' " so , we posted the story on a private @entity115 page for journalists , and another journalist commented that he was relieved that she had already left @entity16			2
so her response , her last message to us , said , ' i think the reports of my survival may be exaggerated			1
it 's sickening trying to understand how the world can stand by and i should be hardened by now			0
i watched a baby die today			0
the doctors could do nothing			0
his little tummy just heaved and heaved until it stopped			0
i 'm feeling helpless as well as cold			0
i will try to keep getting out the information			0
" @entity132 , the media magnate who owns the @entity12 , said @entity10 " put her life in danger on many occasions because she was driven by a determination that the misdeeds of tyrants and the suffering of the victims did not go unreported			1
" and @entity143 , the editor of the paper where she worked for more than 25 years , said @entity21 " was much more than a war reporter			1
she was a woman with a tremendous @entity147 , full of humor and mischief and surrounded by a large circle of friends			0
" see @entity13 's award - winning photos here @entity21 spoke to @entity1 about the suffering in @entity16 the day before she died			1
she told @entity154 that @entity5 was the worst conflict she had covered , partly because of the sheer amount of ordnance falling on @entity16			1
" there 's a lot of snipers on the high buildings surrounding the neighborhood			0
i can sort of figure out where a sniper is , but you ca n't figure out where a shell is going to land , " she said			0
@entity21 had reported from many conflicts , including last year 's @entity30 civil war , where she saw the shelling of the rebel port city of @entity172			1
she stayed in the city after many of her colleagues had left , she told the @entity177 program " @entity178 " in may			2
" it is very dangerous , i mean , it has to be said , and i think part of that danger is also the expectation of shelling			2
i mean , it 's very random , " she said			0
at 20 , @entity13 started photographing conflicts , first in @entity29 , and then he went on to cover the war in the @entity188 , the presidential elections in @entity29 in 2010 , and the @entity192 uprisings in @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity30 , his website says			2
his work was published by @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and the @entity200			0
at least three other journalists have been killed in @entity5 's nearly year - old conflict			1
@entity47 2 tv journalist @entity204 was killed on january 11 when a mortar shell struck a pro-government rally he was attending as part of a government - authorized tour of @entity16 , his network said			1
@entity5 journalists @entity210 and @entity212 were also killed			1
before the deaths of @entity21 and @entity13 , the @entity214 said that at least 11 journalists have already been killed around the world this year			1
@entity1 's @entity217 , who reported from @entity5 last summer on a government - sanctioned trip , later wrote about the dangers journalists faced			1
" away from the prying eyes of government minders , they risk imprisonment , torture , even death to cover the rebels , " she said			2
why do some journalists decide to risk so much by reporting from dangerous locations such as @entity5 ? these journalists are " out there doing their job not for the glory , not for the recognition , but because they genuinely believe that truth is valuable and will ultimately end suffering that otherwise would happen in the darkness , " said @entity239 , a senior faculty member at the @entity240 , a leading journalism school			1
" these are places where we need journalists to be , " @entity239 told @entity1			2
" they are there as our surrogates , because without their firsthand information we have only the partisan government reports to rely on			2
we know the cost of unreliable government information			0
" currently , @entity1 and other media outlets often can not independently verify opposition or government reports because the @entity5 regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists			1
" we know that the cost of sending journalists into harm 's way can be high , " @entity239 said			2
but " the cost of not going there is even higher			0
" with daily reports of civilian fatalities in @entity5 , some critics may question the amount of attention focused on the deaths of a couple of @entity4 journalists			1
but these deaths may resonate more with readers in places such as the @entity11 , said @entity275 , another senior faculty member at @entity240			0
" in these distant , remote conflicts , it 's so hard to know what 's really going on , " @entity275 said			0
" people actually appreciate the valor of independent journalists who do this work			2
... that 's why people are so upset			0
" @entity239 noted that " in any story when you can attach a recognizable name and face to a story , the story becomes more relatable			0
" " this would be a day where it would be right for readers , viewers , and listeners to just to take a moment and thank the brave men and women who go to the world 's hellholes on their behalf , to find out what 's going and bravely report it , " @entity239 said			0
@entity1 '' s @entity303 in @entity304 , @entity305 in @entity306 , and @entity307 in @entity308 contributed to this report			0

@entity311 : " reports of my survival may be exaggerated , " @entity21 wrote hours before her death

colleagues remember longtime reporter @entity10 as " a class act "
