-- last july , the world celebrated the birth of its newest nation as @entity4 officially separated from the north			1
it was hoped then that after decades of bloodshed , the people of of both nations would finally know peace			2
but just a few months later , refugee camps are filling to the brim as fighting in the border states of @entity14 and @entity15 has intensified and displaced more than 400,000 people			1
they arrive at the camps in trucks , on camels and even by foot , said @entity22 , a field coordinator with @entity23 ( @entity23 ) or @entity23			1
" the number of people is increasing every day , " @entity22 said			2
@entity26 erupted between @entity4 's army and @entity4 rebels in @entity14 even before independence was formalized			1
the violence spread to @entity15 in september			2
the @entity31 , which works to expose genocide and crimes against humanity , recently documented killings and rape by @entity38 forces in @entity15			2

" we are looking at a deteriorating humanitarian situation in the areas out of which the refugees in neighboring @entity4 and @entity50 have fled , " @entity46 , the @entity42 ' acting humanitarian coordinator in @entity4 , said this month			1
that in addition to the crisis in the @entity55 region -- where war broke out in 2003 and 3.75 million people still need help -- qualifies @entity4 as one of the world 's largest humanitarian crises , according to the @entity42			1
the world body is asking for $ 1.06 billion to help 4.2 million people in 2012			0
@entity64 of @entity23 is witnessing firsthand the human suffering caused by protracted conflict			1
the medical charity has ratcheted up efforts in the area to deal with a full - scale emergency			1

she had traveled days with six bullet wounds in her back			0
half of one her hands was gone			0
many of the people seeking refuge at @entity73 are suffering from respiratory disease , malaria and malnutrition , @entity22 said			1

or women and girls wait for up to 12 hours to fill a plastic can from a water pump			0
@entity23 installed a massive water bladder to bring some relief			1
@entity23 has also been feeding children high - nutrition biscuits			1
without any other aid agency at @entity73 , it has been difficult for the @entity23 staff , @entity22 said			1
" as a medical organization , we can not help everyone there , " @entity22 said			0
" we can not meet all the needs			0
" earlier this month , the @entity42 refugee agency airlifted relief supplies from neighboring @entity118			2
the @entity120 transport planes carried plastic sheets and rolls , sleeping mats , blankets , mosquito nets , buckets , jerry cans and kitchen sets			0
" these supplies are desperately needed , " said @entity129 , spokeswoman for the @entity42 high commissioner for refugees in the @entity4 capital , @entity132			1
" families often arrive here exhausted , hungry , cold or sick			0
we have already distributed whatever we had on the ground , including aid from @entity132 and @entity139			0
our local warehouse is almost empty now			0
" but few of those supplies have reached @entity143 , where access is difficult because of bad road conditions			0
@entity4 is independent now , @entity22 said , but not free from crisis			2
the @entity23 staff saw 400 malnourished children in one day at @entity73			2
