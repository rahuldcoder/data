-- when she was @entity2 's top diplomat , @entity1 acknowledged that negotiating with the @entity3 for @entity5 's release " would be hard to swallow for many @entity2 , " according to a copy of her upcoming book , " @entity9 , " which was obtained by @entity8			1
in other foreign policy matters , @entity10 writes how she pushed for arming @entity13 rebels and also highlights her differences with president @entity15 on the high - stakes issue			1
she also said that she regretted her 2002 vote in support of @entity2 military action in @entity20			1
also in her book , set to hit bookshelves on tuesday , @entity10 dishes on the 2008 campaign against @entity15 , her feelings about @entity25 , and her role in planning her daughter 's 2010 wedding			1
@entity10 was skeptical of @entity32 release on @entity5 , the former secretary of state writes that the @entity3 's " top concern seemed to be the fate of its fighters being held at @entity37 and other prisons			1
" " in every discussion about prisoners , we demanded the release of @entity43 sergeant @entity5 , who had been captured in 2009			1
there would not be any agreement about prisoners without the sergeant coming home , " she writes , according to the excerpts			2
" i acknowledged , as i had many times before , that opening the door to negotiations with the @entity3 would be hard to swallow for many @entity2 after so many years of war , " she added			1
former officials told @entity0 earlier this week that @entity10 was skeptical of early plans to trade @entity3 prisoners , which the @entity15 administration ultimately did to win @entity5 's release last week			1
a measured defense of release on monday , @entity10 was asked whether she would have approved the same deal for five @entity3 commanders who had been held at @entity37 , @entity64			1
she did not directly answer the question and offered a measured defense of the @entity15 administration			0
" we do have a tradition and i ascribe to it , " @entity10 said			1
" we try not to leave any of our soldiers on the field			0
we try to make sure , insofar as possible , you know , we bring them home			0
" @entity74 have been blasting the @entity15 administration for the prisoner exchange , saying the president set a dangerous precedent by negotiating with terrorists			2
@entity10 left the @entity79 at the start of last year and is weighing another bid for the @entity82			1
' i still got it wrong ' on @entity20 on the @entity85 , @entity10 writes she wish she had n't voted to authorize the use of military force in @entity20 in 2002			1
" as the war dragged on , with every letter i sent to a family in @entity92 who had lost a son or daughter , a father or mother , my mistake become ( sic ) more painful , " she writes , according to excerpts posted online by @entity8			0
" i thought i had acted in good faith and made the best decision i could with the information i had			0
and i was n't alone in getting it wrong			0
but i still got it wrong			0
plain and simple , " she said			0
it 's not the first time she 's expressed regret , but it 's some of the strongest language she 's used on the issue			0
@entity10 's vote became a key topic in her marathon 2008 battle with @entity15 for the @entity117 presidential nomination			1
the issue , more than the economy , dominated the early parts of the campaign , with @entity15 criticizing @entity10 over the vote			1
@entity10 at first refused to term it a mistake , but later said during the campaign that she would not have voted the same way			1
@entity15 , who was a major opponent of the war , never had to vote on whether to authorize military action against @entity129 , as he was not elected to the @entity130 until 2004			0
@entity10 rarely talks about her vote on @entity20 and in the last few months , as she has crisscrossed the country speaking to a wide array of audiences , she has not been asked about it			1
conflict in @entity13 in the book , @entity10 describes the bloody three - year long civil war in @entity13 as " a wicked problem			1
" @entity10 goes on to say that 's " a term used by planning experts to describe particularly complex challenges that confound standard solutions and approaches			1
wicked problems rarely have a right answer ; in fact , part of what makes them wicked is that every option appears worse than the next			0
increasingly that 's how @entity13 appeared			0
" on whether to arm the @entity13 rebels , a contentious issue , @entity10 writes that " i returned to @entity157 reasonably confident that if we decided to begin arming and training moderate @entity13 rebels , we could put in place effective coordination with our regional partners			1
" @entity10 says there was no good policy action for the @entity2 , and she highlights were she and @entity15 disagreed on the conflict			1
" [ @entity167 ] he risks of both action and inaction were high			0
both choices would bring unintended consequences			0
the president 's inclination was to stay the present course and not take the significant further step of arming rebels			0
" no one likes to lose a debate , including me			0
but this was the president 's call and i respected his deliberations and decision			0
from the beginning of our partnership , he had promised me that would always get a fair hearing			0
in this case , my position did n't prevail , " @entity10 writes			1
although as @entity10 backed @entity15 's @entity13 policy as secretary of state - including negotiating with the international community on the civil war and criticizing countries like @entity196 and @entity197 , which stood in the way of toppling @entity13 president @entity199 , @entity10 's writings now show the level with which she split with @entity15 on arming the rebels			1
when asked about @entity13 at events during her time on the paid speaking circuit , @entity10 has used identically language to describe the conflict			1
at an april event in @entity209 , @entity10 told an audience of women leaders that the conflict was a " wicked problem " that " really requires a broad base of knowledge			1
" " it does n't mean you 're not incensed , heartsick , angry , " @entity10 told the audience at @entity216			2
" but then you need to stop and say ' well , what can we do about it ? how can we intervene in a way that helps , not hurts ? ' " @entity15 , @entity25 , and @entity223 @entity10 also takes readers into her private meeting with @entity15 prior to the 2008 @entity117 convention , which gave the former rivals an opportunity " to clear the air , " @entity10 writes			2
" we stared at each other like two teenagers on an awkward first date , taking a few sips of @entity237 , " she writes of the meeting			0
" one silver lining of defeat was that i came out of the experience realizing i no longer cared so much about what the critics said about me , " she said			0
@entity10 also dishes on the @entity15 campaign 's reaction to then - @entity247 gov. @entity25 's selection as sen. @entity249 's running mate , and why she declined to follow the @entity15 campaign 's playbook on slamming the pick			2
while the campaign issued a " dismissive statement " and urged @entity10 to do the same , the then - senator from @entity92 writes that she declined			2
i was not going to attack @entity25 just for being a woman appealing for support from other women , " @entity10 writes			2
" i did n't think it made political sense , and it did n't feel right			0
so i said no. " hitting a lighter note , @entity10 's memoir also discusses the " urgent business " she had to address during her tenure as secretary of state - her daughter 's wedding			2
flying back from @entity270 in the summer of 2010 , @entity10 had to shift her attention from rising tensions in the @entity274 to " one of the most important events of my life			1
" " this time it was n't a high - level summit or a diplomatic crisis			0
it was my daughter 's wedding , a day i had been looking forward to for thirty years , " @entity10 writes			2
" i felt lucky that my day job had prepared me for the elaborate diplomacy required to help plan a big wedding			0
" @entity10 writes that she was happy to help in any way she could and her responsibilities ranged from " reviewing photographs of flower arrangements " and heading home for tastings and dress selections			2
as for the former president ? " @entity296 was as emotional as i was , maybe even more so , and i was just glad he made it down the aisle in one piece , " @entity10 writes			2
as @entity301 and her father danced to " @entity303 , " @entity1 's head swirled with thoughts			0
" it was one of the happiest and proudest moments of my life , " @entity10 writes			2
" our family had been through a lot together , good times and hard times , and now here we were , celebrating the best of times			0
" @entity0 's @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 contributed to this story .			0
