dr. @entity0 , host of " the dr. @entity1 , " faced grilling by senators on @entity4 about the promotion of weight loss products on his show			1
sen. @entity8 , chairwoman of the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , led the panel that on tuesday looked at false advertising for weight loss products			1
subcommittee members took issue with assertions that @entity17 has made on his show about products that do n't have a lot of scientific evidence to back them up , such as green coffee beans			2
" the scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of the three products you called ' miracles , ' " said @entity8 , a @entity26 @entity25			1
she said she was discouraged by the " false hope " his rhetoric gives viewers and questioned his role " intentional or not , in perpetuating these scams			1
" " i do n't get why you need to say this stuff when you know it 's not true			0
when you have this amazing megaphone , why would you cheapen your show ? ... with power comes a great deal of responsibility			0
" the @entity49 is in charge of protecting consumers from " unfair or deceptive advertising and marketing practices that raise health and safety concerns			2
" in may , the @entity49 sued the sellers of @entity56 for deceiving consumers through fake news sites and invented health claims			1
the commission said that weeks after " the dr. @entity1 " promoted the benefits of @entity63 , some companies that marketed the product used video from his show to increase sales			1
the scientific evidence supporting green coffee bean extract as a weight loss supplement is weak			1
a small study published in 2012 found chlorogenic acid , the main ingredient in green coffee beans , helped 16 human participants lose , on average , 18 pounds over 22 weeks			0
but another study on chlorogenic acid in mice found that the acid did not help mice lose weight and in fact , increased their insulin resistance			0
a 2011 meta - analysis of three studies on green coffee extract found the supplement produced , on average , a five - pound loss among study participants			0
but all three studies were short term and included a small number of participants , leading the meta - analysis authors to conclude : " more rigorous trials are needed to assess the usefulness of @entity97 as a weight loss tool			1
" @entity0 told the panel that he does use " flowery language " to describe certain products on his show but added he believes in them so much he has given them to his family			2
" my job , i feel , on the show is to be a cheerleader for the audience , and when they do n't think they have hope , when they do n't think they can make it happen , i want to look , and i do look everywhere , including in alternative healing traditions , for any evidence that might be supportive to them , " @entity0 said			2
in addition to green coffee beans , @entity8 called out @entity120 as another weight loss product @entity17 has promoted			1
" thanks to brand new scientific research , i can tell you about a revolutionary fat buster , " @entity0 said on his show in november 2012 with the words " no exercise			2
no effort " on the screen behind him			0
" it 's called @entity120			0
" â€Ž a 1998 study of 135 participants found @entity136 cambogia did not significantly help people lose weight any more than a placebo			0
but a 2013 meta - analysis of garcinia cambogia studies hedged on the supplement 's ineffectiveness , saying its weight loss benefits " remain to be proven in larger - scale and longer - term clinical trials			1
" whether it helps people lose weight or not , the @entity136 cambogia does not seem to be unsafe to use , some other studies say			0
@entity0 testified tuesday that he could not be held responsible for what certain companies say online about the products			1
he said he 's toned down some of his language and will publish a list of products he thinks really can help people lose weight			2
" to not have the conversation about supplements at all however would be a disservice to the viewer , " @entity0 said in a prepared statement after the hearing			0
" in addition to exercising an abundance of caution in discussing promising research and products in the future , i look forward to working with all those present today in finding a way to deal with the problems of weight loss scams			1
" the @entity173 does not regulate weight loss supplements			1
under current law , companies selling these products do not need @entity173 approval before marketing them to the public			0
" just because you see a supplement product on a store shelf does not mean it is safe or effective , " the @entity173 website says			0
" when safety issues are suspected , @entity173 must investigate and , when warranted , take steps to have the product removed from the market			0
however , it is much easier for a firm to get a product on the market than it is for @entity173 to take a product off the market			0
" these weight loss products , even those that claim to be all natural , may contain toxic ingredients , the @entity173 says , or they may interact badly with other medications			1
make sure to check with your doctor before taking any supplement			0
hidden dangers in vitamins , supplements ? the @entity49 told @entity206 , @entity207 senior medical correspondent , that there are just " too many " weight loss products using deceptive advertising to sue them all			1
but consumers should be wary of certain phrases that are most certainly false , the @entity49 said , including any that claim to help you lose weight without diet and exercise			2
bottom line -- do n't believe everything you see			0
do your homework online and make sure any claim about a weight loss product is backed up by scientific evidence			1
in 2013 : dr. @entity0 insomnia cure left man lame , lawsuit says			2

" @entity0 " host is asked why he promotes weight loss products without scientific backing
sen. @entity8 says products give people " false hope "
in may , the @entity49 sued the sellers of @entity56 for false claims
@entity49 says some companies used video from " the dr. @entity1 " to increase sales
