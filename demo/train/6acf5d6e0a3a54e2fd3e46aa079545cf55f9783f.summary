-- the @entity2 people do not like @entity3 -- and they do n't like @entity3 at historic levels			1
@entity6 polling showed that only 12 % of the @entity2 people approved of @entity3 in february			1
and it 's easy to see why			0
@entity2 think members of @entity3 have no interest in listening to them			1
according to a @entity11 poll , they believe politicians ' priorities are first and foremost special interest groups , then campaign contributors , party leaders and the media			2
listening to their own consciences and their constituents tied for dead last			0
think about what we see every day on @entity26			0
members of @entity3 using elective office as little more than a gateway job to something more lucrative on @entity31 or @entity32			1
there 's a constantly revolving door of @entity36 staffers cycling in and out of congressional jobs and high - paying gigs at industry lobby shops			2
we 've all known a cozy relationship exists between legislators and lobbyists			2
but often they 're in the same family			2
as @entity0 's @entity46 reported for " @entity47 , " 78 members of @entity3 can count federally registered lobbyists as family members			1
those lobbyists number 100 , and according to congressional watchdog @entity51 , they have worked on lobbying contracts worth $ 2 billion			1
@entity55 sen. @entity54 of @entity56 , a member of the @entity57 of the @entity58 , is married to a lobbyist for @entity60 , a company that lobbied in 2013 on farm and agriculture bills			0
@entity65 senate majority leader @entity64 's son and son - in - law have lobbied @entity3 on a variety of issues			1
and this week , @entity64 faced questions about a payment to his granddaughter for " gifts " for his campaign donors -- but he since said he was returning the money to his campaign			0
the personal conflicts of interest for lawmakers are only exacerbated by another big problem in @entity80 : our pay - to - play campaign finance system			2
a smaller and smaller portion of our population has a bigger and bigger share of the influence over @entity3			1
in the 2012 election cycle , a full 25 % of the $ 6 billion donated to political candidates and committees came from just one ten - thousandth of the @entity2 population , according to a @entity92 analysis			1
that 's roughly the number of people in one @entity97 zip code			0
it means members of @entity3 are increasingly dialing for dollars or spending time with people who can write maxed - out checks to their campaigns			1
those are n't people back in their districts			2
they 're lobbyists in @entity80 and bankers in @entity97			0
so far in 2014 , the @entity80 metro area is the biggest giver to campaigns -- listed above all the states -- even though the residents of the @entity80 have no voting representative			0
the system creates a political inequality that leaves those unable to write big checks left out			1
it 's not what our @entity118 had in mind			0
we need to return to a government that is truly of , by and for the people , not bought and paid for by big money donors and special interests			1
there are ways we can turn the tide and get back to the kind of government we the people deserve			0
we need to strengthen revolving - door policies to make it harder for members of @entity3 and their staffs to shuffle in and out of @entity26 offices and swanky jobs in industry lobby firms			1
we need to enact stronger conflict - of - interest standards for family members of our elected officials			1
and most importantly , we need to have a campaign finance system that enhances the power of ordinary citizens through small donor - driven public financing of elections			0
two bills recently introduced in @entity3 show us the path forward			2
in the @entity150 , @entity152 rep. @entity151 of @entity153 has introduced the @entity154 , and in the @entity58 , @entity155 majority whip @entity155 of @entity156 has introduced the @entity157			0
both bills would use a refundable tax credit and matching funds on small donations to help lessen the influence of big money in our elections and empower everyday people			2
candidates for @entity3 could forgo the constant fundraising from wealthy donors and special interest lobbyists , avoid the perception of being in their pockets and focus on representing the interests of their constituents			1
in other words , to do the jobs that they 're elected to do in the first place			0
in @entity97 , a campaign to win similar legislation in that scandal - ridden state is just a handful of votes from passage			0
the @entity2 people have are fed up and do n't trust @entity3			1
it 's time to turn that anger into action by getting behind efforts to fix our broken system with common sense solutions			0
if we do , we can once again have a government that represents exactly what our founders intended : we the people			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			0

the @entity2 people do not like @entity3 at historic levels and believe money rules
78 members of @entity3 can count federally registered lobbyists as family members
25 % of the $ 6 billion donated to candidates came from one ten - thousandth of the population
politicians do n't listen to those unable to write big checks , who are left out of process
