those are terms used to describe @entity6 speaker @entity5 and his plan to sue president @entity8			1
and those are just from from critics on the right			0
since @entity5 announced his intention nearly two weeks ago , reaction has been mixed -- at best			1
@entity15 anger over the president 's sidestepping of a stalemated @entity18 to use his " pen and phone " on issues of immigration , minimum wage , lgbt rights and energy production is for real and far reaching			0
@entity5 's attempt to answer what he considers a rogue presidency is to sue			1
" the president has circumvented the @entity32 people and their elected representatives through executive action , changing and creating his own laws , and excusing himself from enforcing statutes he is sworn to uphold , " @entity5 wrote in an op - ed on @entity1 over the weekend			1
but sharp critics say taking @entity8 to court is n't the right one			0
naysayers on the right ... chief among them is @entity44 , editor of the conservative blog @entity46			0
" @entity5 's lawsuit is nothing more than political theater and a further @entity15 waste of taxpayer dollars , " he wrote monday			1
he also said @entity5 needs to " man up " in more ways than one			1
" @entity5 and the @entity54 may lack the testicular fortitude to fight president @entity8 , " @entity44 wrote			1
another conservative naysayer , columnist and author @entity59 , called @entity5 's actions " feckless			1
" " @entity5 and @entity61 @entity15 are essentially saying , ' we ca n't use our power because @entity8 and his media friends would say mean things about us			2
but our lunatic conservative base is demanding action			0
so let us file a lawsuit so we can say we did something , ' " @entity59 wrote ( sarcastically ) , dissecting @entity5 's suit threat			1
" now that 's leadership ! " @entity59 added			0
for those two , anything short of impeachment is weak and chalked up to political drama in an election year			1
proof that political foes do see eye to eye , the @entity6 gleefully seized the opportunity to promote @entity44			0
spokesman @entity80 tweeted , " i had a bunch of reporters ask me for response to @entity5 op - ed this weekend			2
guess i should have sent them here , " which is a link to @entity44 's column			0
... and the left critics on the left , who obviously do n't support impeachment but are critical of @entity5 , are making similar claims			1
they point to holes in @entity5 's claim			2
commentator @entity94 offered this suggestion to @entity5 in a @entity1 op - ed : " please exercise your ( authority ) and pass some laws to help @entity32 instead of wasting taxpayer money on a frivolous lawsuit that is nothing more than a flagrant partisan stunt			1
" as for @entity8 , he dismissed the threat , saying , " so , sue me			0
" " middle class families ca n't wait for @entity15 in @entity18 to do stuff , " he said last week			0
the merits of a suit @entity5 has given few details and specifics of his complaint			1
in his op - ed , he points to the use of executive action , says the president is " ignoring " 40 bills the @entity6 passed focused on job creation and insists @entity8 ignores " laws written			0
" but he has failed to specify which of @entity8 's 182 executive actions are problematic and which laws he 's ignored			0
in a memo to @entity54 , @entity5 indicated the areas of concern pertains to issues of foreign policy , health care , energy and education -- a wide swath of issues			2
but @entity5 has provided few details because the depth and merits of a suit are still unclear			1
before the suit is even drafted , the @entity6 must pass an authorization to sue @entity8			2
then a bipartisan committee with a majority of @entity15 will formulate the terms of the suit by dissecting all of his actions and determining which have the most legal weight in a court			2
the lawyers @entity5 consulted on the issue wrote that the @entity6 must " demonstrate a concrete , particularized injury , caused by the defendant , which can be remedied by a court			2
" perhaps providing more insight in a column , the lawyers , @entity152 and @entity153 , were more specific about areas of concern than @entity5			0
" with the stroke of a magisterial pen , he has gutted large swaths of federal law that enjoy bipartisan support , including the @entity164 - era welfare reform work requirement , the @entity166 - era @entity163 law and the classification of marijuana as an illegal controlled substance , " they wrote			0
regardless , it 's a process that is likely to draw out into the fall , positioning itself close to the midterm elections			0
" this is a political positioning of the @entity54 , " @entity1 legal analyst @entity175 said			0
opinion : dear speaker @entity5 , do your job instead @entity1 's @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .			1
