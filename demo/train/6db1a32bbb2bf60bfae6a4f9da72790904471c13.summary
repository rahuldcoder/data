@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 will require the @entity3 to provide a detailed plan for arming and training @entity6 rebels to fight @entity7 in exchange for giving it the ok to carry out the mission			1
the provision -- which is expected to be added to a must - pass spending bill funding the government through mid-december and could face a vote as early as wednesday in the @entity3 -- would require the secretary of defense to explain how the @entity17 is vetting @entity6 opposition groups			1
the administration would need to submit its plan to @entity21 at least 15 days before the @entity17 begins training fighters or supplying them with weapons			1
regular updates , every 90 days , would also be required			2
what 's the world going to do about @entity7 ? the @entity3 @entity2 plan also makes it clear that the new authority would not include approval for any @entity33 combat troops on the ground			1
even though @entity3 @entity2 want to put restrictions on the president 's announced plans to go after @entity7 , members of both parties have also made it clear they do n't plan to stay in town to pass a formal military use of force authorization like the one approved after the 9/11 attacks in 2001			1
the tug of the midterm elections is strong , despite sentiment among some lawmakers in both the @entity3 and @entity49 who think it 's critically important for @entity21 to sign off on the broader war effort			1
" i think this is really serious and that it deserves our being in town and taking it up and debating it , " said sen. @entity51 , @entity52			0
who is doing what in the coalition battle against @entity7 ? the @entity3 bill approving training for the @entity6 rebels would expire in mid-december , at the same time the government funding bill would need to be extended			1
that concerned sen. @entity66 , a @entity68 @entity67 who chairs the @entity69			0
" that does n't make sense to me , " @entity66 said			0
" you want to send the message to the @entity75 world , you want to send a message to those rebels you want to fight for you , that we 're not going to cut it off in december			1
" a @entity81 aide told reporters that @entity2 would ensure the training and weapons program would be extended past december			2
senior @entity86 officials will testify before the @entity49 this week			2
secretary of defense @entity87 and @entity90 @entity89 will testify before the @entity81 on tuesday , and secretary of state @entity91 will be on @entity92 wednesday and thursday			0
is @entity86 's plan for confronting @entity7 legal ? the @entity49 will quickly pick up the spending bill , with the accompanying ok to arm the rebels , as soon as the @entity3 passes it , according to a @entity98 leadership aide			1
the vote could be this week or early next week when the @entity49 is scheduled to adjourn until after the election			1
lawmakers and senior aides predict broad bipartisan for the measure in the @entity49			0
" i think , by and large , you 'll see a big vote in the @entity21 for this , " said sen. @entity104 , @entity105 , the third - ranking @entity49 @entity2 said on @entity106 monday			1
" both sides recognize something has to be done			0
we 've got to be aggressive			0
we 've got to be decisive			0
and we 've got to rally the world behind us			0
" @entity114 however , there are numerous outspoken detractors in both parties who are critical of the proposal for a variety of reasons			0
some , like sen. @entity122 , @entity123 , would prefer to debate the broader mission and have @entity21 vote up - or - down on whether to go to war with @entity7			1
in a @entity1 interview he blamed " wimpishness " as a critical factor affecting his colleagues who would prefer to leave town without that tough vote			2
" @entity21 is very risk adverse			2
when you put a difficult issue before senators and congressmen they do n't want to be forced to decide			0
in this case they should be forced to decide			0
we should have a vote on this mission			2
the @entity33 people should see their representatives in @entity21 make a decision on a critical national security question , " he said others , like sen. @entity148 , @entity149 , oppose arming the rebels out of fear the weapons will fall into the wrong hands			1
sen. @entity154 , @entity52 - @entity155 , and other @entity49 hawks want a much more aggressive strategy to destroy @entity7 than the one the president is pursuing			2
senate majority leader @entity159 set the tone for many members of his party when he argued last week the president has the authority he needs to carry out the airstrikes underway against @entity7 , and that it would be a mistake for @entity21 to be " rash " in its decision making			1
" we have to be deliberate in what we do , " he said			0
" let 's just not rush into things			0

the @entity3 could vote this week on the arming and training of @entity6 rebels
vetted elements of @entity6 opposition forces could receive *equipment* to fight @entity7
approval would be tied to a must - pass spending bill that expires in december
@entity21 is about to break for the midterm election campaigning
