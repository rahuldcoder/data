-- @entity1 will forever be known as a @entity3 winner , but had the country of his birth acted quicker his destiny might have turned out rather differently			2
@entity1 was a member of the @entity8 side that landed football 's greatest prize on home soil in 1998 , but having been born in @entity12 , @entity13 , the former @entity15 captain has often faced questions as to why he did n't play for the country of his birth			1
notably from former midfielder rival @entity17 who reportedly said in 2005 : " it makes me laugh , players going on about how they are saving this country and saving that country but when they have the opportunity to play ... well , it 's probably none of my business			0
" @entity1 attributes his decision to play for les bleus partly to the @entity28 's failure to notice his burgeoning talent following his move to @entity8 as an eight - year - old			1
" i did n't have anybody from the @entity13 national team who came to me and proposed for me to play in the national team so the question was never there , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
he came on as a second - half substitute in the @entity40 final against @entity41 , delivering the pass for @entity44 's third goal in the 3 - 0 victory over the reigning world champions at the @entity8			0
and having won 107 caps for @entity8 between 1997 and 2009 , @entity1 has no regrets about the decision he made			2
the 37 - year - old arrived in @entity8 with his family , who were seeking a better way of life , and he remains forever grateful for the opportunity that the @entity56 nation presented him with			0
" i enjoyed playing for the national team , the @entity58 national team , because i think @entity8 gave me a lot and gave my family a lot , so to wear the @entity58 national team shirt was really good and i wore it with pride , " he said			0
" it had never been a decision to choose between the @entity58 national team or the @entity13 national team because i was growing up in @entity8 and playing in the @entity58 youth national team so it was something really normal			2
" eligible to play for @entity8 through his grandfather , @entity1 went on to become the the fifth most - capped @entity58 behind @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
along with @entity1 , that quartet of players was key to @entity8 's @entity3 win in 1998 and the @entity78 two years later			2
@entity13 's inability to spot @entity1 as a youngster and secure his international future provides evidence of @entity85 football 's structural failings , argues the current head of @entity88 's elite development squad			1
" i think what @entity85 football needs is better organization , better structure , and i think after that we 'll help the players to be more professional when they 're coming to play for their national team , " he said			1
" and i think the federations have a massive responsibility on their shoulders because we know there is talent			0
" when you look at the last five - to - six years , the number of players we had like @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 -- i can give you hundreds of names			0
" i think the structure around these players is not strong enough and i think if we do n't have that , it will take time [ for an @entity85 nation ] to win the @entity3			0

@entity1 says he was never offered the chance to represent @entity13
@entity1 instead opted to play for @entity8 and was proud to do so
the former @entity15 captain feels @entity85 football needs to improve its organization
