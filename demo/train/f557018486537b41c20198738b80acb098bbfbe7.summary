president @entity0 dismissed criticism he does n't spend enough time developing relationships with @entity5 deal - makers who can help push his agenda forward			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity12 chief @entity10 correspondent @entity9 , @entity0 said he is determined to make time for his family			1
" sometimes @entity14 and i not doing the circuit and going out to dinners with folks is perceived as us being cool , " @entity0 said			1
" it actually really has more to do with us being parents			2
" the president has been criticized from all sides for failing to achieve more bipartisanship , especially given his 2008 campaign pledge to bridge partisan and ideological divides once in office			1
some of the president 's frustrated allies have complained that a seeming reluctance to build relationships with more members of @entity32 and @entity5 insiders has made it difficult for him to get business done			1
@entity37 gets more personal in the interview , which will air as part of the documentary " @entity0 revealed : @entity45 , the president , " @entity0 suggested he is willing to build those relationships , but often turns down social engagements because he prioritizes time at home with his children			1
" sometimes on the weekends , we may turn down the invitation to this or that or the other just because we 're trying to carve out family time , " @entity0 said			1
" and i think that 's sometimes interpreted as me not wanting to be out there slapping backs and wheeling and dealing			0
that really has more to do with just the stage we are in our lives			0
" asked if things would change if he 's elected to a second term , @entity0 said , " my hope is that getting past this election , people will have an opportunity to maybe step back and say , ' you know what ? the differences that divide us are n't as important as the common bonds we have as @entity69			1
' " " and some of that i 'm sure will require additional effort on my part			0
hopefully , we 'll see more effort on the other side , as well , " he added			0
@entity76 , who penned biographies of former president @entity78 and @entity0 , said the current president " is not going to become this great transactional politician , " like @entity78			1
he would spend the hours between 6:00 and 9:00 ( p.m. ) talking to people in @entity32 , " @entity76 said			2
" whereas president @entity0 is basically with his family during those hours , which is sort of a balanced thing to do but not necessarily good for a president			1
" one of the president 's closest friends and aides , @entity90 , said @entity0 " wants to be the kind of dad he never had			2
" the president has been slammed by @entity94 for what they consider an unwillingness to compromise , particularly in legislative matters			0
@entity94 sen. @entity98 of @entity99 , who worked closely with the president early in his term , said she is not sure @entity0 " truly understands the relationship and interaction that occurs between the president and the legislative branch			2
" " somehow , he thinks , well , the @entity32 is , you know , that 's their job and this is my job , " @entity98 said			0
" but we have to really interact with one another , ultimately , to get the job done for the country			0
" the president said he repeatedly reached out across the aisle in the hope of achieving bipartisan solutions , even at the expense of condemnation from members of his own party			0
it was the @entity94 , he said , that made reaching across party lines nearly impossible			0
" if anything , i think i received a lot of criticism from my own party for going out of my way to try to solicit @entity94 cooperation , " @entity0 said			2
" the fact of the matter was that politically there was a decision that was made fairly early on , among some of their leadership , that said working with the president is not good politics			0

@entity0 has been criticized for failing to build relationships with @entity5 insiders
@entity78 spent evenings talking to *lawmakers* ; @entity0 spends that time with family , biographer says
" it actually really has more to do with us being parents , " he says of turning down dinner invites
