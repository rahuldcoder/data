-- among the thousands of diplomatic documents obtained by @entity3 , there is talk of @entity6 missiles , @entity8 politicians and a myriad of other issues , including one cable about a @entity13 prince -- and his views on geography teachers , the @entity16 , journalists and @entity19 influence in central @entity20			1
back in 2008 , the @entity22 ambassador in the central @entity20 state of @entity24 , @entity25 , was invited to lunch with prince @entity27 , @entity27 , who was in the country to promote @entity13 interests			1
after the encounter , she observed in a cable : " astonishingly candid , the discussion at times verged on the rude ( from the @entity13 side )			1
" when the conversation turned to the problem of corruption , one businessman said that working in @entity24 was " like doing business in the @entity41 " in the 19th century , " i.e. only those willing to participate in local corrupt practices are able to make any money			2
" " at this point the @entity27 laughed uproariously , saying that : ' all of this sounds exactly like @entity16			2
' " at another point , according to ambassador @entity25 , " the prince mused that outsiders could do little to change the culture of corruption here			2
' they themselves have to have a change of heart			0
just like you have to cure yourself of anorexia			0
no one else can do it for you			0
' " referring to his coming meeting with the @entity24 prime minister , prince @entity27 seemed exasperated			1
" with a mock groan , the @entity27 then exclaimed : ' my @entity61 , what am i supposed to tell these people ? ! ' " the prince also addressed @entity19 influence in central @entity20 , stating that " the @entity13 , @entity67 ( and by extension you @entity22 , too ) were now back in the thick of playing the @entity69			1
more animated than ever , he stated cockily : ' and this time we aim to win ! ' " " @entity69 " originally referred to the 19th century struggle between @entity13 and @entity19 for control of central @entity20			0
the cable continued that prince @entity27 indicated he had little patience for the media interfering in the negotiation of business deals , condemning " these ( expletive ) journalists , especially from the @entity79 , who poke their noses everywhere			1
" according to the ambassador 's account , the prince also " railed at @entity13 anti-corruption investigators , who had had the ' idiocy ' of almost scuttling the @entity84 deal with @entity85			0
" that deal was a multibillion - dollar defense contract between @entity90 and the @entity85 government that became the target of a @entity94 corruption inquiry			0
) warming to her theme , ambassador @entity25 continues : " he then capped this off with a zinger : castigating ' our stupid ( sic ) @entity13 and @entity22 governments which plan at best for 10 years whereas people in this part of the world plan for centuries			2
' " but she saves perhaps the best for last , referring to prince @entity27 's " unmitigated patriotic fervor			1
" one @entity13 guest at the lunch had noted that despite the might of the @entity22 economy , @entity13 investment in @entity24 was of a similar magnitude			1
" snapped the @entity27 : ' no surprise there			0
the @entity22 do n't understand geography			0
in the @entity13 , we have the best geography teachers in the world ! ' "			0
