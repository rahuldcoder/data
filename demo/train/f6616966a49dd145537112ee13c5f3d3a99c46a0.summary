-- the capture over the weekend in @entity2 , @entity3 , of @entity4 , a suspected terrorist on the @entity6 's @entity5 , was clearly a triumph for the @entity9 military and intelligence agencies			1
but was it a victory for the rule of law ? while senior administration officials have portrayed it as such , the jury is still out			2
if the government of @entity3 is to be believed ( and there is reason to be skeptical ) the @entity9 did not inform @entity3 of its plan to capture @entity4 , much less ask permission			1
in fact , they have referred to his capture and swift removal from @entity3 as a " kidnapping			2
" the more proper legal term for what the @entity9 did to @entity28 is a " rendition " -- the abduction or forced removal of someone from their home country without administrative or judicial process , followed by transfer to another country			0
@entity3 questions @entity9 ambassador over @entity28 capture if done without the consent of the host government , this is indeed a violation of that nation 's sovereignty , but a much less serious one than conducting a drone strike or other use of military force			1
as for the detained individual , there is no remedy for such a violation			0
according to a 1992 @entity9 @entity54 case , even an illegal rendition will not prevent a properly indicted defendant from being tried in federal court			0
and that is where @entity28 should be delivered in the near future			0
even if the @entity9 did not inform @entity3 of its plans , if the @entity9 had evidence of ongoing involvement with @entity63 , the capture of @entity4 was justified under the laws of war			1
importantly , both secretary of state @entity67 and secretary of defense @entity68 expressed the propriety of the capture under the laws of war and the importance of the rule of law in conducting counterterrorism operations			2
according to a @entity77 statement , @entity4 is being " lawfully detained under the law of war in a secure location outside of @entity3 " -- apparently a @entity82 warship in the @entity83 -- where he is being interrogated			1
the @entity9 appears to be following the hybrid approach to counterterrorism developed in the case of @entity87			0
@entity87 , a @entity88 , was captured by military forces on april 19 , 2011 , then held and subjected to intelligence interrogation , with no @entity92 warning , for more than two months aboard a @entity82 ship in the @entity94 , before being brought to the @entity9 to face federal criminal charges			0
what the terror raids say about an ' @entity98 ' @entity87 pleaded guilty in december 2011 to nine charges and has provided extensive cooperation to federal authorities , in an effort to receive a reduced sentence			0
the @entity105 case is an excellent example of how military , intelligence and law enforcement assets can be utilized to efficiently remove a terrorist threat from circulation in a legally supportable way while still eliciting valuable intelligence , and is a good template for the @entity9 to follow in @entity4 's case			1
@entity116 was indicted in 2000 for his alleged role in the @entity9 embassy bombings in @entity119 and @entity120 in 1998 and his involvement with @entity63			0
interestingly , @entity4 was charged in the same indictment as @entity123			2
the differential treatment of these two alleged co-conspirators demonstrates how @entity9 counterterrorism efforts have evolved from the @entity128 administration to the @entity130 administration			2
@entity123 was captured in @entity131 in july 2004			0
when @entity131 authorities transferred him to @entity9 custody , he was not brought to @entity134 to face the federal indictment			0
rather , he was taken to a secret @entity137 internment camp where he was subjected to a harsh @entity137 interrogation regime for two years before being transferred to @entity139 in 2006			2
@entity123 was later charged before a military commission in @entity139 in october 2008 , just weeks before president @entity130 was elected			1
these charges were dismissed in may 2009 when @entity123 was transferred to the @entity9 to face the federal charges			0
he was convicted in november 2010 , 6Â½ years after his capture			0
@entity123 was the only @entity139 detainee to be transferred to the @entity9 for trial			1
although @entity123 received a life sentence for his role in the @entity149 embassy bombings , some key evidence against him was suppressed by the federal district court judge because it had been acquired through coercion			0
this decision may have contributed to @entity123 's acquittal on all but one of the dozens of charges in the indictment			0
@entity123 's " near acquittal " played a significant role in @entity159 ' decision to block the transfer of any further @entity139 detainees to the @entity9 for any reason , including prosecution in federal court			1
because of this ill - advised restriction , coupled with strict conditions imposed by @entity159 limiting the transfer of detainees to third countries , the @entity130 administration has wisely opted not to bring any new terrorism suspects to @entity139			1
opinion : good thing @entity9 terrorist hunters were n't furloughed the president should resist calls , such as made in a recent @entity179 op - ed , to bring @entity4 to @entity139 and try him before a military commission			1
such suggestions ignore the impact of recent @entity184 rulings that have properly limited the charges that may be brought in military commissions , particularly for pre- 2006 activity , to recognized international war crimes			0
based on the offenses listed in @entity4 's indictment , it is not at all clear that prosecution in a military commission is a viable option			1
secretary of defense @entity195 stated that the purpose of the targeted military operations this weekend in @entity88 and @entity3 was " to bring international terrorists to justice			1
" the best chance to accomplish this is to find out what @entity4 knows through humane , noncoercive interrogation , then promptly bring him to trial in federal court in @entity134			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 : seizure of @entity4 being *hailed* as triumph for rule of law
he says the *situation* is n't clear and it appears @entity3 government might not have been told
putting @entity218 on trial in regular court would be a good thing for rule of law , he says
@entity208 : @entity130 should resist calls to send him to @entity139 and try him in military court
