-- call @entity1 an " angry black woman " if you want , but be prepared for the response			1
a @entity6 firestorm erupted friday morning when @entity8 writer @entity7 described @entity1 , the producer of @entity10 's " scandal , " " @entity11 " and the new " how to @entity12 , " by using the term " angry black woman " in a feature about her			1
" when @entity1 writes her autobiography , it should be called ' how to get away with being an @entity20 , ' " @entity17 wrote			2
the story later observed , " ms. @entity1 has embraced the trite but persistent caricature of the @entity20 , recast it in her own image and made it enviable			2
" immediately , the @entity25 reacted , led by a bemused @entity1 , who observed that she did n't create " how to @entity12			2
" " confused why @ nytimes critic does n't know identity of creator of show she 's reviewing , " she tweeted in response to a tweet from @entity28 , who did create the series			0
( @entity35 , @entity36 -- a former " @entity11 " staffer -- is a white male			0
) rhimes was just getting started			0
" apparently we can be ' angry black women ' together , because i did n't know i was one either ! @ petenowa # @entity42 , " she continued			1
and , noting that @entity17 had highlighted a rant from " @entity9 's " @entity45 ( @entity44 ) as illustrative of @entity1 ' own perceived anger , she wondered why other rants by white characters do n't get the same attention			2
" final thing : ( then i am gon na do some yoga ) : how come i am not ' an angry black woman ' the many times @entity54 ( or @entity55 ! ) rants ? @ nytimes , " she tweeted			1
" @entity11 " star @entity58 , who plays @entity59 on " @entity11 , " agreed			0
" did n't @entity59 ( @entity60 ) and @entity61 also terrify and intimidate medical students ? " she tweeted			0
others also lit into the @entity8 piece			1
" wow , " tweeted " scandal 's " @entity65			0
" did i just read a @ nytimes piece that reduced my brilliant , creative , compassionate , thoughtful , bada * * boss to an ' angry black woman ? ' " @entity72 's co-star @entity70 gave a more pointed response , referring the @entity8 to two articles that dispute the " angry black woman " label			1
" so @entity1 is ' angry black woman ' but @entity82 ' delivers an opinionated speech ' and ' forceful denunciation ' , " posted @entity77 of " @entity81 's " writer and creator , who 's also fond of rants			1
" too many thoughts on the @entity1 - is - an - @entity20 debacle			2
mostly : really , @ nytimes ? ! " added @entity87			0
@entity17 wondered what all the fuss was about			0
" the whole point of the piece -- once you read past the first 140 characters -- is to praise @entity1 for pushing back so successfully on a tiresome but insidious stereotype , " she said in a statement			1
@entity0 's @entity98 contributed to this report .			0
