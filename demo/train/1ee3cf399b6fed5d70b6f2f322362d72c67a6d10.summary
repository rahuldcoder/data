-- the @entity2 commentator veered from disbelief to anger and then , finally , to mirth			2
it was the opening heat of the men 's 100 meters freestyle swimming at the 2000 @entity9 , but only one man was standing on his block : @entity12 from @entity13 , a tiny , oil - rich state in west africa			1
there had been two other swimmers to compete with -- one from @entity18 , the other from @entity20 -- but both had jumped the gun , dived in to the pool and been disqualified			2
the crowd cheered , the gun fired and the 22 - year - old dived in			2
suddenly he was on his own			2
what followed was one of the most memorable two minutes in @entity31 history , one that would embody something far away from the podiums that honor the motto of the modern games : " faster , higher , stronger			1
" during the first 50 meters @entity12 appeared to be holding his own , but by the turn things had gone very wrong			1
at one point he appeared to stop , treading water to catch his breath before continuing			2
" this guy , " remarked the commentator for @entity45 tv , who was none other than @entity47 , gold medalist in the same discipline at the @entity49 , " he 's not going to make it ... i 'm convinced this guy is going to have to get hold of the rope in a minute			2
" ' me against the swimming pool ' looking back today , @entity12 is hard pressed to disagree with him			1
" it was me against the swimming pool , " he recalls with a laugh			2
" i did n't care about anything else , i just wanted to finish the race ... when i went to @entity62 that was the first time i had seen an @entity31 swimming pool			1
i was scared of the dimensions			2
" somehow he managed to crawl to the end , posting a time of one minute 52.72 seconds			2
the man who would eventually win gold in the event , @entity68 of the @entity71 , would finish the final in 48.30 seconds , his swim made him an instant star of the @entity9 -- dubbed " @entity12 " by the world 's media -- and lampooned around the world for posting the worst time in the history of the sport			1
but it also reminded the world that there 's far more to the @entity31 spirit than just victory			1
a voice on the radio @entity12 did n't start out as a swimmer			1
growing up in @entity89 , the capital of @entity13 , he excelled at soccer and basketball			1
but one day , three months before the start of the @entity9 , he heard an advert on the radio with an intriguing offer			1
" i heard on the radio that they ( the @entity98 ) needed swimmers , so i went and put my name down , " he recalls			2
he may not have wanted to be an @entity31 swimmer but , having practiced in a local river , @entity12 decided to give it a shot			1
when he arrived at the hotel in @entity89 where the trial was to take place , he soon discovered that the competition was nonexistent			2
" we were called for the selection , and i was the only person who was there ! " he says			2
for two hours we were waiting			2
i was the only one			0
that was in the only hotel that had a pool , a 12 - meter swimming pool			0
they told me to get in and asked if i could swim			2
" after proving that he could swim , @entity12 was told that he would be heading to @entity119 after securing a place on the @entity13 @entity31 team , a place that had been gifted by the @entity124 's wildcard system that gave less developed nations a chance to send athletes to the @entity31 to gain experience			1
" they just told me to get my passport and a picture ready so they could send me to the @entity31			1
they said to me , ' keep on training			0
' i asked them , ' with who ? i do n't have a trainer			0
' they said : ' do what you can			0
keep training because you are going to the @entity31			1
' " preparations were tough for @entity12			1
there was no @entity31 - sized pool in @entity13 and the hotel pool was only of limited use			1
still , he left for @entity62 for the first time knowing that , if nothing else , it would be an adventure			2
" the @entity31 was something unknown for me , " he says			1
" i was just happy that i was going to travel abroad and represent my country			0
it was new for me			0
it was very far from @entity154			0
" the terror of the pool it was n't until he turned up for training on the first day that he saw an @entity31 - sized swimming pool for the first time			1
reality quickly dawned on him			0
" when i arrived i just went to the swimming pool to see how it is			0
i was very surprised , i did not imagine that it would be so big , " he says			0
" my training schedule there was with the @entity170 swimmers			0
i was going to the pool and watching them , how they trained and how they dived because i did n't have any idea			0
i had to know how to dive , how to move my legs , how to move my hands			0
" i learned everything in @entity119			0
i did n't know how to dive , anything			0
while they ( the @entity170 swim team ) were training i was watching them			2
i did n't have a coach			0
" when the day of the race arrived , @entity12 sat in his seat with his goggles on , going through everything he had learned from the @entity170 swimmers			1
" i was just thinking , ' do whatever you think you can do			0
' i was thinking how the @entity170 swimmers were training , " he explains			0
but when his two competitors were disqualified for two false starts , @entity12 suddenly felt very alone			1
" at first i was thinking that i was the one who was disqualified ! " he laughs			0
" they told me i was the only one that was going to swim , so i was very nervous			2
everybody was screaming : ' go go go ! ' " out on a limb most athletes can only a recall a blur of memories when remembering their time at the @entity31 , but @entity12 remembers every second of that race : the pain , the fear , the exhaustion and finally the relief			1
" the first 50 meters i did very well			2
i did it with a lot of energy			0
when i was coming back to complete the 100 meters i was exhausted			1
if you watch the video , i could n't feel my legs			0
i was feeling like i was n't going to go any further			0
i was moving in just one place			0
" the crowd was singing , ' go go go go ! ' so i did my best to complete it			0
but once i completed it i was exhausted			0
i thought , ' phew , my god ! ' all my muscles were tired			0
so when i went in to the changing room i just collapsed on the floor and lay there			0
i could n't even breathe			0
" the anti-hero it is unlikely that any swimmer will ever get close to @entity12 's time , which is more than a minute slower than the women 's 100m record and not even as quick as the best men 's 200m effort			1
but once he picked himself up off the changing room floor he had become a worldwide celebrity			1
" the media attention was , phew ... " he remembers			0
" everyone in the media was asking about me			0
oh , where 's @entity12 ? i did n't know how to speak @entity2 back then			1
people were saying i was a star			0
but i did n't know what to do			0
a lot of people were making fun of me , others were congratulating me			0
" but what they did n't understand was that it was my first time in a swimming pool			2
people were making fun of me			0
but some said you are a good example of the @entity31 spirit			1
" while most people saw the true values of the @entity31 movement in @entity12 's quixotic swim at @entity119 -- heart , determination , a never - say - die spirit -- his performance sparked much hand - wringing elsewhere			1
@entity262 athletes were offended that more talented swimmers were denied a place at the @entity31 to accommodate developmental athletes			1
as @entity47 said in a later interview : " it was quite a defining moment for the @entity31 as to whether that level of performance should be in @entity31 competition			1
" the end of @entity12 ? sure enough the @entity124 tightened up the rules on wildcard entries to prevent other " @entity273 " from turning up			1
but they still slip through the net			0
only this week @entity276 , a rower from @entity18 , was hailed as the " new @entity12 " after finishing 100 seconds behind his nearest rival in the men 's single sculls repechage			1
@entity45 's five - time olympic gold medalist @entity281 criticized the decision to allow @entity276 to compete			2
" there are better scullers from different countries who are not allowed to compete because of the different countries you 've got , " he said			0
yet it was @entity276 , and not the winner , who was roared across the finishing line			0
few outside of the swimming world will remember @entity119 champion @entity295 , but " @entity12 " has become an @entity31 euphemism			1
" they even took my trunks to display in an @entity31 museum in @entity119 , " he happily boasts			1
an outside bet for @entity301 ? but if swimming development was a key aim of the @entity124 's decision to give @entity13 a wildcard at the @entity307 , then the move can be seen as a roaring success			1
after the cameras left , @entity12 continued to swim			1
his last competition was the @entity311 in @entity312 in 2002 and his times have steadily improved			0
and although he did n't make it to @entity315 four years later , nor @entity316 , he is now the national swimming coach of @entity13 and hopes to still have one last shot at next @entity31 in @entity318 in 2016 before he retires			1
" my last time was 55 seconds , that was only last year , " the 34 - year - old explains hopefully			1
" right now i 'm the coach of the country but i 've asked my @entity31 federation if i can swim at the next @entity31			1
" i still have a dream			0
i want to show people that my times have improved , that we have swimming pools in my country now and that i can now swim a hundred meters			1

@entity0 talks to @entity12 , better known as " @entity12 "
@entity13 athlete became a worldwide celebrity for the worst swim ever
he finished 100 meters freestyle heat at @entity9 in *double* the world record time
now 34 , @entity12 is hoping to return to the @entity31 at @entity318 in 2016
