" @entity11 , @entity4 , police @entity12			0
@entity14 said he filed a probable cause statement friday for two more alleged victims who wish to seek charges against @entity18			1
this could lead to more counts against the 36 - year - old @entity18 , who is already facing a felony charge accusing him of exposing one of his former live - in partners to @entity6			1
the scope of what happened and what 's to come remains to be seen -- both in terms of the breadth of legal trouble @entity18 will face and the hundreds of lives he might have forever altered , directly and indirectly			2
to the latter point , authorities in the rural southeastern @entity4 county where @entity18 lived are urging anyone with reason to suspect they could have been infected to stop their sexual activity and get tested			2
" due to the initial exposure containing 300 or more individuals over an extended period of time , each of which could themselves have multiple sexual partners , this situation should be a serious concern , " @entity41 prosecuting attorney @entity40 said in a statement			2
@entity40 added it was especially important action be taken by anyone in the area who had met for a sex act through the @entity62 website 's " men seeking men " section			0
that 's how the victim said he first connected with @entity18 in october 2012 , according to a criminal complaint obtained friday by @entity0			0
the pair then had unprotected sex -- though only after the victim told police he " specifically asked if ( @entity18 ) had any disease and @entity18 replied no , " the document says			1
the next month , @entity18 and the younger man moved in with each other			0
except for a 16 - day stretch in december , they remained live - in partners in @entity11 , a city of about 8,000 people some 160 miles south of @entity79 , until june 2013			0
it was then the younger man , now 29 , told police he ended the relationship " because he discovered @entity18 was cheating on him			1
" sometime later , according to the complaint , that man got a call from a woman who had lived with @entity18 in 2011			0
she told him that @entity18 revealed to her he 'd been @entity6 - positive since 2003			1
after that , the victim took a test at the @entity93 that showed he also had the virus			0
the suspect confirmed he had tested positive in @entity97 to the victim and later to police , officials said			0
that diagnosis did n't stop @entity18 from having hundreds of sexual partners -- including 15 to 20 instances of unprotected intercourse , sometimes involving a third man , with the victim tied to the charge issued this week -- according to the criminal complaint			1
the same day he talked with the victim , @entity11 police detective @entity107 found @entity18 , who agreed to be interviewed and waived his @entity109 rights			1
the suspect confirmed what his former partner had said , saying he did n't tell those he had sex with about his @entity6 diagnosis because of " fear of rejection , " the complaint says			1
while authorities have tracked down some of @entity18 's sexual partners -- 50 to 60 of whom lived in @entity41 -- " countless others remain unknown , " @entity40 said			2
@entity107 said the suspect may not be of much help , because @entity18 " usually only knew his partners ' first names			2
" many of them were in the @entity130 area , where @entity18 spent some time , according to the @entity11 police detective			1
" @entity18 indicated all his sexual partners were white males , " @entity107 noted			1
knowingly exposing someone to @entity6 without their consent is a felony under @entity4 law that can bring a prison term up to 15 years			0
infecting someone can bring a life term			0
@entity18 's bail was set at $ 250,000 during his arraignment thursday in @entity41			0
@entity0 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0
