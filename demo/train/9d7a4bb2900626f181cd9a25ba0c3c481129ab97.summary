@entity0 , @entity1 -- this is my first time visiting one of the most dangerous places on earth			1
the devastated @entity9 nuclear plant is isolated from the rest of @entity1 by police checkpoints , security fences , and barricades			1
we ride on a bus with a handful of journalists into the highly contaminated " red zone " -- the area closest to the plant			1
it remains a desolate wasteland three years after the meltdown , when @entity0 residents had just hours to grab their belongings and leave			2
they still have n't come back and likely wo n't be able to for a very , very long time			0
the only people regularly allowed into the red zone these days are workers with face masks and protective gear			1
we pass them as they labor in heavy clothing , braving the heat along the roadside , filling black bags with contaminated soil			0
dead fields , once full of crops , are now filled with endless rows of those black bags			0
what makes this part of @entity0 such a frightening place is that you ca n't actually see the danger lurking everywhere			1
radioactive water is leaking , soil is contaminated , and workers must brave dangerous conditions as they try to slowly and painstakingly take the power plant apart -- a process expected to take decades			1
impact underestimated ? the true scope of the contamination is a subject of debate , with a research team from @entity57 recently releasing a study that claims the plant operator @entity59 ( @entity59 ) grossly underestimated the amount of radioactive poison cesium - 137 released into the environment			2
exposure can heighten the risk of cancer			0
the team 's report says cesium spewed into the air then fell into the water			2
@entity59 acknowledges it 's impossible to know for sure how much cesium was released , but the company based its estimate on their best information			2
contaminated fish is a huge concern , considering seafood is a staple of the @entity1 diet			0
researchers told me they do n't believe the risk extends far beyond @entity1 and the @entity84 , even though small traces of radioactive ocean water have been detected as far away as @entity87			0
the amounts detected so far are not high enough to cause any harm to humans			0
conditions inside the @entity0 plant , though , are extremely dangerous			1
i had to wear layers of protective gear and a @entity96 counter , to detect radiation			1
my shoes were wrapped in plastic to prevent spreading any radiation from contaminated floors			0
the plant has thousands of times more radiation than was in the bomb dropped on @entity106			2
outside , i saw the mangled metal piled up near buildings along the coast that bore the brunt of the 2011 tsunami			0
it sent a 50 - foot wall of water crashing into the power plant			0
inside , i watched workers remove a fuel rod in reactor 4			2
it is slow , grueling work in a reactor that is fully intact			0
reactors 1 , 2 , and 3 melted down and the extensive damage there makes the process even more difficult			0
it will take decades and billions of dollars to make this place safe again			1
i saw the control room where workers scribbled notes on the walls after the power went out			0
the protective gear i was wearing got increasingly hot and uncomfortable as sweat poured down my back and condensation clouded the view through my visor			1
i can only imagine what it 's like for the workers who wear this gear everyday while they work tirelessly to contain this slow - burning disaster			1
after leaving @entity9 , i felt great relief as i was scanned for radiation exposure and none was detected			2
but as i rode on the bus out of the red zone , i also felt great sadness for the tens of thousands of people who once lived there			1
i imagined how powerless i would feel if it was my house or business sitting empty and falling into disrepair , not knowing if it would ever be safe to go home again			0
interactive : how @entity0 changed world 's attitudes to nuclear power			1

@entity2 's @entity162 visited the devastated @entity9 nuclear plant
the only people regularly allowed in the red zone are workers in protective gear
conditions inside the @entity0 plant are extremely dangerous
it will take decades to make the place safe again
