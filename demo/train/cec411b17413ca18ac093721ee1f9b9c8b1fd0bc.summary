-- @entity1 recently announced new privacy controls that enable users not only to limit how their information is shared , but also to better understand how that information is exposed to others			1
increased transparency and strong , simple privacy controls like these are practices more companies should embrace			2
@entity1 's changes follow a recent move by a @entity15 panel to approve a bill that would require law enforcement to get a warrant before reading private e-mail			1
this proposed change to the outdated 1986 @entity21 is good news -- and not just for the likes of gen. @entity24 , who would rather their compromising situations remain private			1
both actions are important steps toward improving privacy protections online , but we have a long way to go -- because it 's not only e-mails and social networks we might want to keep private			1
what about our purchases , the websites we visit , or our personal details ? consider my own recent experience			1
a friend reached out to me , concerned over the profile he had seen of me on a dating website			0
i was listed as a widow and , as he and i both knew , my husband is still very much alive			0
to my horror , someone had set up a dating profile for me , using information easily gleaned from the @entity48 : my name , my photo , the university where i teach , the number of my children			0
all of it was accurate except two claims : i was a widow and that i was " looking for a relationship			0
'' how much do @entity57 , @entity1 profit from your data ? many privacy advocates and information security experts react to examples like mine with calls for more consumer control of information			1
if we treated personal information like private property akin to a home or car , the argument goes , then i would have the power to decide when and to whom to " sell " or license my information , and of course would have a case against the dating website for " stealing " it			1
but responding to the ever - expanding market in private information by participating in its sale seems to only legitimatize and promote , not limit , the practice			0
more important , viewing privacy as an individual problem to be fixed by individual property rights will not lower our risks because it fails to take into account the social value of privacy			1
one obvious social value is in protecting personal details -- name , occupation , marital status			1
the problem with the dating site profile was n't that i did n't get paid for my information			2
it 's that its misrepresentations could have had serious consequences for my personal life and my reputation			1
i have a strong interest in ensuring reported facts about me are correct : we all do			0
much of modern social and economic life would be impossible without reliance on such facts			0
privacy enhances social relationships , both private and contractual			1
i share information with my doctor not simply because i value her services and expect confidentiality , but because i trust her and value our relationship			0
in health care , patients must be willing to disclose personal and intimate information to clinicians			0
if someone exposed to @entity124 or bird flu were not willing to tell a doctor because of privacy concerns , not only would his or her health suffer , but the health of all would be endangered			0
probably the most important social value related to privacy is its role in civic engagement , which of course includes voting , but also the ability to interact freely without surveillance			2
although we worry mostly about government agents snooping on us , corporate and third - party surveillance of online communications , relationships and activities has increased significantly in the past decade			0
most forces in the marketplace encourage companies to exploit rather than protect consumers ' private information			0
businesses lack information accountability and fair information practice policies are weak			0
online tracking of purchases , social networks , and locations for commercial gain could end up harming civic engagement in the same way that we worry government surveillance will do			2
opinion : despite @entity1 , privacy is far from dead because privacy is social , it is not a property of individuals			1
my " individual privacy " is actually created , and thus protected , by people i know , and my doctor , my bank , my telephone line , my voting booth , my library card			2
@entity174 depends on social norms , professional ethics , organizational policies , legal rules and regulations and technical standards			0
no one of these mechanisms -- technology , norms or laws -- determines or fully protects privacy , but in concert they do			0
to argue that the best way to bolster privacy is to make it an individual responsibility contradicts its actual social nature			1
another drawback : people might not be very good at managing their privacy by themselves			2
in the rush to adopt a new device or try a new application , many do n't fully consider , or are even aware of , tradeoffs they might be making when they provide a lot of personal details			2
new @entity1 policies and the proposed strengthening of the electronic privacy act are important steps , but until we follow privacy - by - design technology , strengthen fair information practices , and encourage policies that recognize the social nature of privacy , our online world will continue to lack the mechanisms we need to promote and protect personal privacy			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

@entity218 : @entity1 's new protections , enhancement of e-mail privacy act good news
@entity225 : but we need to protect privacy of purchases , websites we visit , personal data
the idea privacy is something an individual can own and sell is *bad* *strategy* , she says
@entity225 : privacy ca n't be regulated alone ; it 's a social , community bond
