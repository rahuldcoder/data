@entity0 -- proving once again that any controversy will be intensified -- if not illuminated -- by random references to race , class , and gender , education secretary @entity2 has ignited a storm of protest by noting opposition from " white suburban moms " to one of his prized educational initiatives			1
in a meeting with state education chiefs friday , @entity2 said some opposition to the @entity18 -- a controversial effort to standardize education -- has come from parents displeased that test results have exposed local weaknesses			1
@entity2 said he found it " fascinating " that opponents include " white suburban moms who -- all of a sudden -- ( discovered that ) their child is n't as bright as they thought they were , and their school is n't quite as good as they thought they were			1
" @entity2 apologized for the remark monday afternoon			1
speaking to @entity1 , he said : " my wording , my phrasing , was a little clumsy and i apologize for that			1
" @entity2 said his point was that the goal is to prepare @entity36 students for a " globally competitive work force " and to challenge education leaders to better explain to parents why higher standards are needed and what it takes to achieve them			1
" i did n't say them perfectly , and i apologize for that , " he added			0
" my point is that children from every demographic across this country need a well - rounded , world - class education and frankly we have challenges not just in our inner cities but in our suburban areas , too , and we need to have honest conversations about that			2
" the " white suburban moms " remark was first reported friday by @entity56 , which later reported that @entity2 backpedaled , saying that he " did n't say it perfectly			1
" the incident , if nothing else , is thrusting @entity18 into red - hot glare of politically oriented social media			2
@entity2 has pushed the initiative , which seeks to establish a single set of educational standards for kindergarten through high school for math and @entity70			2
advocates say the standards are essential to improve student skills , prepare them for college , and make the @entity36 competitive with other nations			0
but opponents say the standards instill students with elitist values and rob communities of local control of schools			0
the remarks triggered a barrage of online comments , and a @entity86 petition			2
as of noon monday , 1,800 people had signed the petition to remove @entity2 as secretary of education			1
a separate ' " @entity91 to @entity92 , " protest over the standards has gained thousands of supporters on its @entity95 page , though the number of children who were kept from school is unclear			0
conservative commentator and @entity18 foe @entity100 scolded @entity2			1
" ohhhh yes , the red blood underneath my brown skin is boiling			0
this @entity105 educrat has stepped in it			1
race card - wielding education secretary @entity2 is nothing but a corrupt and bankrupt bigot , " @entity100 wrote			1
tweeted @entity112 , president of the @entity113 : " @entity2 - if u are reading - you shld walk this back			2
. very insensitive - and not right - moms care abt their kids ! ! one @entity120 - area mother posted a personal response on the left - leaning @entity122 arguing that @entity2 missed the point			1
she said her own son was late to focus and achieve , and standardized testing would have marginalized him			0
" i do n't fight the @entity18 because i think my child is brilliant , but because i 'm tired of these one size fits all educational solutions , " wrote @entity126			2
" so yes , i 'm opposed			0
not because i do n't understand it			0
not because i think it will make my children look bad			0
but because i know that children already look bad -- and by the time they might get it together and look good the way ( my son ) could , it might be too late			0
" a @entity140 official said in an e-mail that , in making his remarks , @entity2 was encouraging state education chiefs to better communicate why higher standards are so important			1
" the far right and far left have made up their minds , " spokesman @entity145 wrote			0
" but there 's angst in the middle -- which includes many open - minded suburban parents -- that needs to be addressed			0
" " @entity2 -- a white suburban dad married to a white suburban mom , with two kids in public schools -- has always been clear that test scores are an imperfect measure of student achievement and school quality , but tests are an indicator nonetheless , " @entity145 wrote			1
" and when that indicator conflicts with parents ' notions of their child 's abilities or their school 's quality , it 's understandable that some parents would be concerned			0
" the @entity172 spokesman also defended @entity2 , though @entity173 said he had not seen all the comments			2
" his point was that we need to be honest with kids and parents -- all can agree on that , " @entity173 said on monday .			0
