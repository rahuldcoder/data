@entity0 -- @entity3 interior minister @entity2 warned friday that although the @entity6 separatist group @entity5 has declared an end to violence , the most difficult task still lies ahead -- ensuring no @entity3 suffer the threat of terror attacks in the future			1
his remarks come a day after @entity5 announced a " definitive cessation of its armed activity " in a statement published on the website of @entity17 , a newspaper the group has used to convey messages in the past			1
@entity5 is blamed for hundreds of deaths in its decades - long fight for an independent @entity6 state that it wants carved out of sections of northern @entity3 and southwestern @entity27			1
speaking friday on @entity28 , @entity2 said : " we have completed a first part of our task , ( but ) there remains the more complex one , guaranteeing through the strict enforcement of our laws that never again will any generation of @entity3 have to suffer on their backs the weight of a barbarity that slows down our progress and compromises our future			2
" he said @entity5 had been defeated " by the tireless and unstoppable work of the police and the civil guard " and that as a result it had been forced to declare an end to violence without achieving a single one of its aims			2
the security services had achieved that outcome " with tenacity , with work , with dedication , and above all , with a lot of suffering , " he said			0
@entity57 spokesman @entity56 said friday that @entity5 's announcement " holds out the prospect of a historic step toward peace , although there is a long road ahead to realize this promise			0
" he paid tribute to the victims of @entity5 violence , adding : " we recognize the courage of the @entity3 government and the @entity3 people in their enduring efforts to advance democracy and freedom in @entity3 and around the world			1
" " the @entity3 people have endured over 40 years of violence at the hands of @entity5 , " said the spokesman for @entity78 @entity77 ban ki - moon			1
" the secretary - general shares in the hope that @entity5 is committed to bringing this tragic chapter for @entity3 to an end			2
" @entity86 president @entity85 hailed the development as " a truly historic moment which ends years of terror and attacks on @entity3 society			0
" the news " marks the culmination of years of unceasing efforts in the fight against terrorism , " he said , congratulating @entity3 on its efforts to combat @entity5			1
police have cracked down in recent years on @entity5 in @entity3 and @entity27 , leaving it operationally weak			1
there have been numerous statements from the @entity6 group calling for talks or a peace process of some sort , but all falling short of declaring a definitive end to violence			2
the @entity3 government said that since @entity5 has broken cease - fires in the past ; only an authoritative statement that it is putting down its arms for good will do			2
thursday 's announcement followed a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently			0
that effort was led by international figures who include @entity119 leader @entity118 of @entity120 and former @entity78 secretary - general @entity121			0
in a nationally televised address hours after the announcement was posted , @entity3 prime minister @entity122 termed @entity5 's announcement as being of " transcendental importance " and a " victory for democracy			1
" " ours will be a democracy without terrorism , but not without memory , " @entity122 said , referring to 829 people killed by @entity5 and their families			0
the prime minister praised @entity3 police , @entity136 personnel , the intelligence agency and judicial authorities " who have contributed to this end			0
" @entity122 also singled out @entity27 -- which has traditionally been used as a rearguard base for @entity5 -- and its president , @entity142 , for their assistance			2
the prime minister said that it would be up to @entity3 's next government -- which will be formed after parliamentary elections on november 20 -- to lead the peace process			1
in remarks thursday night at their respective political party headquarters in @entity0 , the two main contenders to replace @entity122 -- @entity152 , the candidate from @entity122 's @entity154 , and @entity155 , leader of the opposition @entity156 -- cheered the development but did not detail what they would do next if they were to become prime minister			0
in its statement thursday , @entity5 -- which is listed as a terrorist organization by @entity3 , the @entity164 and the @entity165 -- outlined why now was the right time to make such a declaration			1
" a new political time is emerging in the @entity170 , " @entity5 said			0
" we have a historic opportunity to find a just and democratic solution for the centuries - old political conflict			0
" the group then added that " dialogue and agreement " should predominate " over violence and repression			0
" @entity5 urged the @entity3 and @entity27 governments to conduct " direct dialogue " aimed at addressing outstanding issues while calling upon fellow @entity6 to commit to such a process			1
@entity1 's @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
