-- pope @entity2 's resignation captured the world 's attention , and rightly			1
it is the first papal resignation in nearly six centuries			2
the pope leads a church that includes a sixth of the world 's population			1
his gravitas reverberates outside @entity13 : the pope talks and people listen			2
others are fascinated by @entity18 spectacle			1
@entity2 speaks @entity19 and wears gold vestments			1
his successor 's election by conclave , with sequestering and smoke , is high drama			2
but for all the excitement and ceremony , the pope is not the most important thing about @entity13			1
for all his influence , the pope makes up an infinitesimal fraction of the opinions and activities of @entity36			1
the most important thing about @entity13 is the 1 billion who claim it as their faith			2
in the wake of updating by the @entity18 , @entity41 bishops emphasized the role of the laity			1
many @entity48 theologians stressed the whole community of @entity36 working together			1
opinion : why pope will be remembered for generations the issue is not only what the @entity54 should look like			1
we should be concerned about media and popular takes on what @entity13 does look like			2
news coverage of the @entity54 is usually about the hierarchy			1
ask average @entity61 about @entity13 and they likely will mention the pope			2
this happened for several reasons			0
no other big religious institution is so centralized			0
the media covers the pope as @entity13 because it is easy to cover the pope as @entity13			1
place a correspondent in @entity71 or even just use @entity18 press releases			1
there is no highest authority of @entity75			0
there is no international imam of @entity78			0
also , despite the @entity18 council of the 1960s , popes kept expanding their authority			1
@entity2 endorsed that council but read tradition to support papal sovereignty			1
if popular opinion overwhelmingly associates @entity13 with the papacy , that 's partly because effective @entity18 theologizing made it so			1
@entity90 : @entity91 shows true leadership by resigning finally , the @entity61 has always had an obsession with the pope			2
ironically , this obsession had roots in @entity96			0
@entity61 " used " the pope as a way to sharpen national identity			2
@entity61 democracy was contrasted with papal demagoguery , @entity61 piety with papal superstition , @entity61 modernity with papal obsolescence			0
@entity61 @entity36 felt pulled between nation and church			1
scholars have noted that @entity61 faithful were more pope - identified than coreligionists around the world , as if overcompensating to hold the two sides together			1
but obsession involves both attraction and loathing			0
even ardent anti-catholics seemed consumed with fascination for the pontiff			0
the infamous publisher of anti-catholic comics , @entity120 depicts decadent popes lofting ominous speech bubbles , precisely capitalizing on the fact that such scenes make gripping graphic art. it 's as if the pope â € ” with absolute rule , a throne , pomp and circumstance â € ” taps into a repressed fantasy of crowns and ermine			1
perhaps pop god @entity137 put it best : so u can be the president i 'd rather be the @entity91 yeah , u can be the side effect i 'd rather be the dope arguably @entity137 is right ; the pope is bigger than the president			2
but the pope is not the dope			0
at least not for purposes of best analyzing @entity13			0
while the popes have attempted to maintain the status quo from the top down , three major phenomena are happening in the @entity54 from the ground up -- and the media would be well advised to pay attention			1
this refers to religion as it is actually lived , rather than how leaders say it should be lived			0
a term coined by @entity160 of @entity161 , vernacular religion highlights that while clerics write creeds and command pulpits , official religion is the tip of the iceberg of religious culture			0
opinion : why next pope must open up church and usher in @entity172 this became visible in coverage of bishops ' activism against president @entity178 's health care law provisions for artificial birth control			1
the bishops held the official position that artificial birth control was morally wrong			0
most news accounts added that a majority of @entity61 catholic women used it anyway			0
this addition was a start , but it needs to go further			0
according to doctrine , women were " going against " their @entity54			1
but in terms of vernacular religion , their everyday @entity13 was simply different from the approved version			0
last year a @entity195 blog headline read , " will the @entity196 ? " as several noted in the comments , @entity13 has already split			0
@entity13 is actually not one structurally unified body â € ” and has n't been since 1054			0
the @entity200 churches are catholic , the biggest headed by the @entity201			0
the @entity202 ( including the @entity61 @entity54 ) identifies as both @entity48 and @entity203 , headed by the archbishop of @entity205			1
the @entity48 churches of @entity207 formed in the late 19th century as harbor for @entity36 who rejected papal infallibility ; they are in communion with @entity211			2
in the @entity61 at least 200 separate small @entity48 churches and clergy associations exist , often with their own bishops			0
some are @entity216 , a corps of married priests who celebrate the sacraments ; @entity219 , who like many others are ordaining women ; and the @entity223 , which has partnered with the other two groups			0
some people live in several @entity48 worlds			0
in the @entity61 , a @entity48 woman might attend a @entity41 parish , work for @entity230 , serve as an independent catholic priest , officiate weddings for divorced @entity233 on weekends and do @entity236 meditation every morning , too			0
what would it mean to account for vernacular @entity13 ? @entity240 @entity36 ? flows between @entity71 and other institutions ? understanding one of the world 's most populous faiths needs to encompass all of @entity13 -- not just the @entity41 version			1
and certainly not just the pope			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			2

@entity250 : pope @entity2 's resignation rightly drew *enormous* world attention
she says often media focus on the pope as *entirety* of @entity36
while pope commands attention , lay groups have become *increasingly* important , she says
@entity264 : @entity54 is split over many issues ; @entity18 doctrine is only part of the story
