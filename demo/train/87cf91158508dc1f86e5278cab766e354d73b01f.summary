-- when origami enthusiast @entity2 discusses her art , you quickly understand that it is about a lot more than folding paper			1
" in many ways it has been therapeutic , " she says			0
" i find the process of folding paper to be almost meditative			0
" @entity12 can be used to create incredibly realistic forms , not just to the likeness of say , an insect , but down to the exact species of that particular insect with proportions of its body segment true to real life			0
at the other end of the spectrum , you can mold paper to create the most abstract of forms beautiful because of their inherent structure instead of their likeness to real life forms			0
as someone interested in both science and art , i love that origami bridges the two			1
" worldwide movement now @entity36 is bringing her passion to the people of @entity40			1
for the exhibition surface to structure : folded forms , which will take place at @entity40 's @entity45 from june 19 to july 4 , @entity36 has gathered more than 130 works from 88 artists around the world			1
the exhibition includes adorable rabbits folded by @entity52 origamist @entity51 , and a realistic rendering of a field mouse by @entity56 @entity55			2
but it also includes " @entity58 -- the @entity59 " , a more ominous work by @entity63 origamist @entity61			0
it shows a winged angel carrying a sword			0
the exhibition marks the 55th anniversary of the 1959 exhibition @entity69 and @entity70 -- the first origami exhibition held in the @entity56 , which also took place inside @entity45			1
so far @entity36 has raised more than $ 24,000 of the $ 32,000 she needs to cover the cost of shipping the works , organizing security and building display cases			0
collectively the works demonstrate how origami artists are pushing the boundaries of technique and style			1
transcending language barriers in the 1950s , @entity85 organist @entity84 helped popularize the art by creating a universal system of diagramming , which involved arrows and illustrations rather than words			2
his book allowed people across the world to learn the craft and to easily construct pre-existing designs			0
but today artists have moved beyond that , with many using software that helps them dream up and then fold their elaborate works			1
" most origami involves folding one sheet of paper into some final form , " @entity36 says			2
" modular origami uses multiple sheets of paper , folded into identical units , and takes these units and interlocks them , without cuts or adhesive , to obtain a final form that is usually very angular and representative of geometric solids			2
a couple of my designs add embellishments onto the surfaces of these polyhedra			0
" regional variations in the art are becoming smaller and smaller as more people learn about origami via the @entity125			1
however , @entity36 says that she observed a few patterns among artists while curating her exhibition			1
@entity63 artists tend to be masters of wet folding , which creates soft , gentle bends rather than sharp creases			2
" their styles can be somewhat minimalist , and there is so much beauty in their simplicity , " she says			0
" the @entity85 tend to be more calculated and precise with their folding , which can allow for a huge amount of detail and complexity			0
i think the @entity146 style of origami lies somewhere between these two extremes			2
