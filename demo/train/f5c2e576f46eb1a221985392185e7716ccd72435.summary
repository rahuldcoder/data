-- with pope @entity2 leaving the papal office after resigning two weeks ago , the @entity1 will have to rush to pick his replacement before @entity5			1
normally , the @entity6 is not allowed to select a new pontiff until 15 to 20 days after the office becomes vacant -- usually when the previous pope has died			2
@entity2 's resignation is a rare exception			1
the last man to quit the head of the @entity1 did so 600 years ago			0
the situation calls for some rule bending , and having the current pope involved is proving advantageous			1
interactive : where does the pope live ? he has slightly amended the 500 - year - old policy on pope selection to get a successor into place more rapidly			1
the cardinals may to be able to pull it off before march 15 , according to father @entity25 , a @entity26 spokesman			2
this would give the new pontiff a little over a week to prepare for the next mass , @entity30 celebrations , on march 24			0
while @entity2 wo n't be directly involved in his successor 's selection , his influence will undoubtedly be felt			1
he appointed 67 of at least 115 cardinals set to make the decision			1
the pope gives his last audience wednesday morning			2
his last day on the job is thursday			0
here 's a look at the process of electing a new pope : a look at possible papal contenders what has to happen first ? there were traditionally three methods of choosing a new pope , but the church abolished two , leaving cardinals to pick a peer via paper ballot only			1
when a pope dies , the dean of the @entity6 calls for a meeting of all cardinals eligible to vote -- those under age 80			1
they have to vote in person			2
although some work at the @entity26 , most are spread out worldwide , running dioceses or archdioceses , and will have to travel to @entity64			0
once they get there , they ca n't leave until the process is done and are n't allowed to talk with anyone outside of the conclave			0
though @entity2 left the rules greatly untouched , experts on the church 's constitution will comb through the section on the " vacancy of the @entity77 and the @entity78 " ( how to elect a new pope when the office is vacant ) and interpret proper protocol for the election			1
@entity2 's predecessor , the widely popular @entity83 , made a number of changes to the voting process in 1996 to make it less taxing on the cardinals			1
opinion : how next pope must tackle child sex abuse will the world get to see the process ? although the procedure is transparent to participating cardinals , no one else is supposed to find out about the vote			1
in his amendments to voting procedures in 1996 , @entity83 anticipated modern forms of communication and forbade any recording devices			0
he ordered that technicians check the @entity104 for hidden microphones or cameras before the balloting begins			1
the new pope would be called to deal with violators personally			2
" they will be subject to grave penalties according to the judgment of the future pope , " the former pontiff wrote			2
notes cardinals make during the voting must be burned with the ballots			2
the final declaration of a winner is sealed in an envelope and archived			0
it may be opened only by order of the pope			2
the pope in retirement : what to expect what does balloting look like ? the meeting of cardinals , called the conclave , usually begins with a special morning mass in @entity132			1
in the afternoon , they walk in a procession to the @entity104 -- known for its famous ceiling painting by @entity137 artist @entity136 -- to begin the voting process			1
ballots are passed out , and cardinals write in a candidate 's name and fold it up , then one by one , in order of seniority , they approach an altar and ceremoniously place their ballots into a chalice			2
voting is secret , but ballots are counted in the open			0
a cardinal needs a vote of two - thirds to ascend to the papacy			2
if there is no winner , the vote is repeated one time on the first day			2
surprising standards for next @entity1 leader what does the smoke from the chimney mean ? after some of the rounds of voting , the ballots land in a furnace			1
if no one has won , a chemical is added to make the smoke black			1
this lets people waiting in @entity173 below know that there is no new pope yet			0
if there is a winner , no chemical is added , and the smoke remains white , telling the world that the conclave has agreed on a new pontiff			1
in the past , it has been hard for the crowd waiting in @entity173 below to discern the color , which has sometimes billowed out in shades of gray			0
the @entity26 has attempted to remedy this by adding a second furnace to boost the intended color			0
scandal threatens to overshadow pope 's final days what if there is no winner ? then they vote again , and again , and again			1
the cardinals may cast ballots as many as four times on the second and third days , according to voting rules laid down by @entity83 by the end of the third day , if there is still no new pope , they break for a day for prayer , discussions and admonitions from a senior cardinal			1
this recovery day was instituted by @entity83 voting can go on for another seven rounds of balloting			0
still no pope ? keep voting			0
@entity83 had decided to save the cardinals from themselves , if they reach this point			0
he reduced the necessary result to elect a new pope to an absolute majority -- 50 % plus one vote -- if they cross this tiring threshold			1
but in 2007 , @entity2 reversed the rule , so once again , two - thirds are needed to elect , according to @entity0 's @entity26 expert , @entity224			1
the pope emeritus preserved the day of rest on every third day of a deadlock			0
a long deadlock would be unusual , according to the @entity229 , @entity230			0
of the past 11 conclaves , none has run longer than four days			0
when there 's finally a winner , what next ? the winner must accept the decision for it to be valid			0
once he does , the dean asks him to choose a papal name			0
the oldest cardinal announces the new pope to the crowd in the square from a balcony			0
the new pope joins him to bless the crowd and the rest of the world			0
past popes have been crowned during a coronation ceremony , but @entity83 refused it , and @entity2 followed suit			1
both were inaugurated in a mass in @entity132			0
could the next pope be from @entity254 or @entity255 ? @entity0 's @entity256 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 changed a rule , which means the selection could take longer
of the 115 cardinals set to vote , 67 were appointed by @entity2
