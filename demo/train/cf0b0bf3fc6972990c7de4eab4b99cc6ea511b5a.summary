climate change is here and will only worsen			1
get used to more flooding , wildfires and drought , depending on where you live			0
cities and states across @entity9 already are spending lots of money to respond			0
those are the take - home messages of a new @entity14 report released tuesday that is part of president @entity16 's second - term effort to prepare the nation for the impacts of a changing climate such as rising sea levels and increasingly erratic weather			1
the @entity23 update said evidence of human - made climate change " continues to strengthen " and that " @entity9 are noticing changes all around them			2
" " this is not some distant problem of the future , " @entity16 told @entity27 , while @entity28 , who directs the @entity29 , said climate change " already is affecting every region of the country and key sectors of the economy			1
" read the @entity23 the @entity16 administration wants the report to ignite awareness of the need for government and communities to respond now to climate change in the face of fierce political opposition , mostly from conservatives			1
unrelenting political opposition a relentless campaign backed by the fossil fuel industry and its allies challenges whether climate change is real , and if so , whether human activity such as increased carbon emissions from power plants , factories and cars contributes to it			2
in a statement coinciding with the report 's publication , the @entity14 said the findings " underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change , protect @entity9 citizens and communities today , and build a sustainable future for our kids and grandkids			1
" breaking down the report by region @entity73 , a @entity74 operative who now counsels the president , told reporters that @entity16 will kick off a broad campaign this week to publicize the report , while @entity80 members and other administration officials would be " fanning out " across the country to spread the word about how climate change impacts specific regions			1
@entity87 critics immediately pounced on new report as a political tool for @entity16 to try to impose a regulatory agenda that would hurt the economy			1
@entity93 @entity87 leader @entity92 of @entity94 mocked what he described as the hypocritical stance of " liberal elites " who demand strong action on climate change while failing to reduce their own carbon footprint			1
" even if we were to enact the kind of national energy regulations the president seems to want so badly , it would be unlikely to meaningfully impact global emissions anyway unless other major industrial nations do the same thing , " @entity103 said in arguing against proposals to reduce industrial pollution			0
he called the debate " cynical " because @entity16 knew that " much of the pain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle class			0
" changing attitudes ? to @entity73 and @entity28 , the reality of climate change will win out over opponents of new energy policies to combat it			2
" public awareness has been going up and will continue to go up , " @entity28 told reporters , predicting increased public support for government action to reduce @entity9 carbon emissions and for @entity9 to take a leadership role on climate change in the international arena			1
five things you can do recent polling indicates most @entity9 believe human activities cause climate change , but also shows the issue is less important to the public than the economy and other topics			2
a @entity143 poll in march found that 34 % of respondents think climate change , called global warming in the poll , posed a " serious threat " to their way of life , compared to 64 % who responded " no. " at the same time , more than 60 % of respondents believed global warming was happening or would happen in their lifetime			1
more than 300 experts helped produce the report over several years , updating a previous assessment published in 2009			0
@entity73 called it " actionable science " for policymakers and the public to use in forging a way forward			0
scientists categorize the response to climate change into two strategies -- minimizing the effects by reducing the cause , which is known as mitigation , and preparing for impacts already occurring or certain to occur , which is called adaptation			2
the report breaks the country down by region and identifies specific threats should climate change continue			1
major concerns cited by scientists involved in creating the report include rising sea levels along @entity9 's coasts , drought in the @entity183 and prolonged fire seasons			0
sea levels rising it predicts sea levels will rise at least a foot by the end of the century and perhaps as much as four feet , depending on how much of the @entity189 and @entity190 ice shelf melts			0
such an outcome could be catastrophic for millions of people living along the ocean , submerging tropical islands and encroaching on coastal areas			0
low - lying @entity9 cities already experience high flooding , with @entity199 planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to address the problem , noted @entity201 of @entity202 , who chaired the advisory committee that produced the new assessment			0
the @entity206 could experience heavier droughts and heat waves with increasing frequency , while more wildfires in the @entity211 could threaten agriculture and residential communities , the report notes			0
@entity16 's week - long focus on climate change continues wednesday , when the @entity14 convenes a summit focused on green building tactics			1
later in the week , @entity16 will announce new solar power initiatives , according to @entity73			0
in his first term , the president faced opposition by @entity87 and some @entity74 from states with major fossil fuel industries such as coal production to significant climate change legislation			1
he pledged to renew his efforts on the issue in his final four years , including using executive actions that bypass @entity229			0
@entity16 has introduced new regulations on vehicle emissions and created " climate hubs " that help businesses prepare for the effects of climate change			1
a major upcoming issue is a proposal under consideration by the @entity16 administration to build the @entity240 , which would transport tar sands oil from @entity242 to the @entity243			2
environmental groups say the project would contribute to climate change because tar sands oil is dirtier than conventionally drilled crude , and importing it would maintain the country 's dependence on fossil fuels			1
republicans and some democrats from oil industry states want the pipeline approved to create jobs and bolster exports from a strategic ally and @entity9 neighbor			0
the new assessment calls for continued mitigation steps including regulations and programs to reduce carbon emissions , as well as necessary planning and investment to deal with the known impacts			0
@entity201 cited some adaptation measures already underway , noting a " terrific plan for extreme heat events " by the city of @entity273			0
" things are starting to happen , " @entity201 said , adding that the continued efforts over time will " ultimately present a very positive picture " about @entity9 taking action on climate change .			2
