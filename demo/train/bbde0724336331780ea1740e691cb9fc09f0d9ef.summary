-- to help keep the peace with her in - laws during holidays , @entity1 adopted a rule several years ago about talking politics : do n't do it , and do n't take the bait if anyone starts in			1
her relationship with her father - in - law in particular had always been fraught with tension , said @entity1 , who asked that her name be changed to preserve family relations			1
she was the " screaming liberal from @entity16 " who 'd corrupted his @entity19 - bred son into moving to " @entity21 " and voting @entity20			0
as far as she was concerned , he was a good ol ' boy who did n't like to talk politics as much as preach his views			1
her resolve was put to the test three years ago at @entity28 , right after @entity29 was elected president			0
she was picking at her turkey when , she says , her father - in - law suggested an act of violence toward @entity29			1
she attempted to keep cool by gathering her children and leaving the table			0
but then he repeated it at dessert			0
" i finally said to him , ' you ca n't use that language in front my children			1
' then he told me , ' you ca n't tell me what i can say in my home			0
' that led to a tirade with all kinds of four - letter words and him storming out , " she said			0
" before this , i just tried to ignore him , change the topic or walk away			0
but this comment ... it could n't be ignored , " she said			0
unfortunately , things have n't been the same since , she says			0
they have n't spoken in more than two years , and he refuses to visit her family , though her mother - in - law visits regularly			1
@entity1 's case represents an extreme example of a @entity28 horror story , but most of us have one			1
the holidays tend to bring out the best and worst in people , especially among those we love			1
but as election season heats up , politics becomes an increasingly common topic around the dinner table ... as if we needed more stress when visiting family			1
" politics is dangerous because people identify so closely with their beliefs			1
for my father - in - law , it was n't just who he would vote for but a part of who he was , and if you disagreed with his political beliefs , it was like it was a rejection of him , " @entity1 said			0
" for some people , political beliefs become too much a part of their personality , who they are , and they ca n't separate them from a person			0
that 's where we ran into trouble , because i truly wanted to get along with this man , even though i did n't agree with him on most fronts			1
i still wanted to have a loving relationship for the sake of our family			1
" politics may not be an easy topic for families with diverging viewpoints , but that does n't mean it 's off - limits , said etiquette expert @entity112 of the @entity113			1
in fact , people do n't need to agree as long as they 're capable of respectful back - and - forth , as opposed to testy debate			2
" when people are willing to listen , which means not dominating the conversation and allowing yourself to be open to another idea , it can work , " she said			2
" you may already know what the other person 's going to say , but letting their voice say it is where respect comes in			2
" avoiding anger in your tone is another way to keep things healthy and family - functional , she said			2
" it 's about respect , not making judgments and not using words that carry judgments			2
given what a big deal the political conversation is , i think it 's one worth making an effort over			1
" with some , a respectful conversation just is n't in the cards , and we usually know who those people are , @entity145 said			1
identify the people who are your triggers , and be proactive in your conversation choices : set the agenda and the tone , and do n't let it be politics if you already know that a lively conversation wo n't come out of it			1
another key consideration is what you hope to achieve by engaging in such a discussion			0
are you there to change their mind or talk about what 's going on in the news ? if it 's the former , you 're probably barking up the wrong tree , and you may damage the relationship in the meantime , she said			1
it goes both ways , of course			0
if it becomes clear that someone is not just listening but trying to convert you , have some exit phrases on hand to end the conversation or lead it elsewhere , she said			1
something like " we 'll have to agree to disagree " or " i 'll consider what you said " are good ways to get someone to let go and move on , @entity145 said			1
if the conversation proceeds , choosing your words wisely could mean the difference between a lively back - and - forth and an uncomfortable standoff , she said			2
" do n't assume other people believe what you believe			0
people will casually mention something about a candidate or a position or a piece of news and mention it in a way that clearly states a position and assumes everyone agrees with it			2
that can be deeply uncomfortable and , depending on the position , leave someone stifled in a conversation , " @entity112 said			1
in other words , leave the punditry to the pundits and focus on positions you can defend with facts instead of catchphrases			1
" in your own language with politics , cleansing it of idioms can make it more about facts and not opinions , " she said			1
" the goal is to avoid polarizing language			1
for example , ask someone what they think about health care rather than ' @entity230			0
' talk about the facts you know as opposed to ' i ca n't believe those guys are always pulling that stuff			1
' it makes a big difference			0
" not everyone goes by the same facts in the digital age , so even assuming that your facts are the ones everybody agrees on can land you in risky territory , said @entity245 , author of " from clueless to @entity247 : manners for the @entity249			1
" as much as you can prepare for the ones you love , a few variables inevitably pop up , such as the new significant other , the exchange student or the friend without a place to go			0
" if someone brings home a new love interest , i 'm going to hold back a little bit and say , ' what do you think of the debates so far ? ' so i will be able to gauge the new person 's political leanings , " she said			2
" if we agree , that 's great			2
i can launch into personal philosophies			0
if we do n't agree , i will ask a couple of innocuous follow - up questions to see if this is someone who can have civilized political discourse			0
maybe they can educate me , and it wo n't sway my vote , but it will make me a more well - rounded human being			0
if person gets red in the face and voice starts to rise , i will say , ' that 's interesting			2
so , have you seen this new film ? ' " if you 're the one hosting dinner , lay down some ground rules and let guests know what to expect , especially those who are easily agitated by opposing viewpoints , @entity1 said			0
tell your liberal parents that you 're inviting friends from the young @entity291 campus group			0
you might also consider sitting them on the same side of the table so they ca n't make eye contact , she said			0
setting ground rules for all guests is a new part of @entity1 's routine ever since that fateful @entity28 dinner three years ago			2
politics are off - limits as a topic of discussion , especially if alcohol is being served			2
she wishes it did n't have to be this way ; she also wishes that she had a better relationship with her father - in - law , she said			0
" hopefully , sharing my story will let others know they 're not alone			0
i also hope it makes people think about what they say and how they say it , especially when it comes to politics			0

it 's possible to talk politics with family over turkey in a respectful conversation , experts say
@entity112 : avoid polarizing language ; focus on positions you can defend with facts
know your limit , and devise an exit *strategy* if conversation takes turn for worst , @entity145 says
keep in mind that not everyone agrees on same set of facts , expert says
