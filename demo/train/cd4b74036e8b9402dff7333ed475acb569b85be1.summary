" i think it was february , after i do n't know how many ( job ) rejections , " the 48 - year - old told @entity2 , the frustration still clear in her voice , " i actually remember sitting here kind of yelling , ' this is it ! this is enough ! ' " that moment , @entity3 decided to create her own business , a one - woman photography and media company based in her family 's century - old home			1
with that decision , the energetic former newspaper photographer took a gamble that is central to the debates over the economy and the @entity27			0
small businesses generated 65 % of the new jobs in @entity30 over the past 17 years , according to the @entity31			1
and such firms , defined as having fewer than 500 workers , employ half of all workers in the private sector			1
both president @entity36 and @entity37 have spoken about the importance of small businesses and their commitment to supporting them			1
but @entity3 already understands the bigger issue : how to make sure a nascent business survives			2
" right now , i 'm not making much money , " @entity3 sighed , her laptop perched on the antique writer 's desk that used to belong to her grandfather , " but i think once more people know who i am and actually see me out more , i think that could change			2
" better off than four years ago ? watch @entity3 's @entity51 in addition to the normal steep hill involved with starting a business , this entrepreneur faces a hurdle with her location			1
@entity3 moved back to the small town of @entity0 , @entity1 , two years ago to help her mother , who was ill and died last fall			1
she has stayed in the farming community of 278 people for a number of reasons			0
her aunt is ill and in a nearby nursing home , and after returning to @entity0 , @entity3 has had a renewed sense of family and easy - going community			0
" there 's not a lot of nightlife here , " she admitted			2
then the former newspaper worker paused , her face then lighting into a smile , " but in the evening , when it gets cooler , you 'll see people walking , and they 'll walk through town or through the old cemetery			0
" @entity3 pointed out the homes of relatives , friends and perhaps the town 's most knowing resident , mrs. @entity84 , whose house has a clear view of the church steps			2
now , she hopes she can beat the odds and make a small business thrive in this quiet town			1
according to the @entity31 , a third of all small businesses shutter in the first two years , and half call it quits in the first five			1
this is what the men running for president say they want to change , and both men say they 'd try to help by changing the tax code			0
@entity37 would like to cut all individual income taxes by 20 %			1
but critics say the @entity104 's plan would result in higher tax rates for the smallest earners , like @entity3 , and lower tax rates for some bigger companies			2
@entity37 vs. @entity36 on taxes @entity36 has not made a specific proposal for individual income tax cuts but insists that he is for tax reform that would lower most rates			1
he has signed and proposed other specific tax help for small businesses , including a deduction on $ 125,000 worth of expenses			1
as with @entity37 's plan , critics point out that larger businesses could end up with lower tax rates than some small companies under the president 's proposal			1
@entity126 's behind - the - scenes video with @entity3 in @entity1 , @entity3 's business , with just five paying clients , is about as small as they get			1

" how we 're going to work has changed , " @entity3 said , her wide eyes getting narrow , " it 's possible , and this is scary , i never receive another full - time job			0
