-- twenty - three homeless shelter pods barnacled to the side of a railroad station in @entity4 , @entity5 , are safe , for now			1
once they touch the ground , most legal bets are off			0
that 's sort of the point , bien sûr			2
architect and former graffiti artist @entity11 seeks out these neglected armpits of cities ' public space and transforms them into light , flexible , emergency housing			1
he calls the process " architectural kama sutra " because of the unorthodox ( and exciting ) positioning of the structures next to , above , or below traditional buildings and city elements			0
@entity25 , as the @entity4 project is called , will be included in a series of similar efforts for @entity29 's book , @entity30 ( s ) , coming out in february of next year			2
@entity29 designed @entity25 -- the title a nod to the city 's drug - fueled gun violence problem -- in 2009 , but it was erected this past september in just 12 hours			1
the domes , which resemble a group of camouflage spider eggs , feature thermal blankets and storage space , the simplest requirements for temporary stays			1
all but one pod can fit two people , hence the number 47			1
putting up the structure in september was also part of @entity29 's strategy			2
" in @entity5 , there 's a rule saying in wintertime , you ca n't take someone out of housing , " @entity29 explains			1
meant to protect low - and middle income workers from being pushed out of housing and into the suburbs by obscene rent increases , recently passed laws now guarantee that most renters wo n't end up on the streets during the coldest months			0
according to @entity29 , the rule applies to @entity25			0
and because the structure is tacked to the side of the @entity67 - @entity66 train station , and not sitting horizontally on the property of the nearby cultural center , it also qualifies as public space			1
hoisting shelters on a wall plays another role as well -- that of visibility			2
while low and middle income workers might be quietly shuffled out of city centers in the spring , summer , and fall , @entity29 's work turns @entity5 cities ' housing crisis into a living , breathing billboard year - round			1
" @entity82 is very important , but it 's almost like a caricature of what 's happened			2
people in the low class and even in the middle class do n't have the power to afford to stay in decent houses , especially in @entity5 , " @entity29 says			1
" this is a failure of the housing system as we know it			0
we 'll be facing in the years to come more climate refugees , more political refugees , and the city will have to stand massive amounts of people coming			2
" oddly , though , the people using the @entity25 are n't native @entity4			0
when @entity29 went back to visit the structure in october , it was mostly populated by young travelers			0
( those would be the groups of curiously well - dressed homeless people you see in pictures above )			0
still , @entity29 hopes his project inspires other architects to work on more community - minded projects that take advantage of public space			1
" i really think that for architects now there are new ways , technical ways and methods , that would take us out of not only being the arm of the government , " he says			0
" we can be more open to societal problems			0

a @entity5 artist has turned the sides of urban public spaces into emergency shelters
erected in just 12 hours , the domes *provide* a *sleeping* space for 47 people per night
by building them on a wall , the artist hopes to make @entity5 's homelessness problem visible
