-- @entity3 is not cooperating , making it difficult for the @entity5 's nuclear watchdog agency to provide " credible assurance " that the country does n't possess undeclared nuclear material , the @entity2 director general @entity1 said monday			1
speaking to the @entity2 's board of governors , @entity1 said @entity3 should grant access " without further delay " to the @entity14 military complex , where the @entity15 is believed to have tested rockets			1
since @entity3 has not provided such access to date , " @entity17 therefore can not conclude that all nuclear material in @entity3 is in peaceful activities , " @entity1 said			2
for about a decade , international observers have accused @entity3 of secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons program , which @entity3 consistently denies			2
@entity1 noted that @entity3 has recently begun installing @entity24 centrifuges at its fuel enrichment plant at @entity26 , and that those high - speed devices that rotate to enrich uranium are more advanced than the previously - installed centrifuges			1
the @entity2 board has been trying to negotiate cooperation from @entity3 for years			1
on wednesday , diplomats from the so - called @entity33 -- the six - nation diplomatic bloc consisting of the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 -- held secretive talks with @entity3 representatives in @entity42 , and then announced future meetings on march 18 and april 5			1
the @entity15 already faces sanctions from the @entity5 @entity45 for violating a @entity5 resolution forbidding it from enriching uranium			0
but @entity3 says since it signed the @entity48 , it should be able to enrich uranium for peaceful energy needs			0
the @entity2 was created in 1957 to promote " safe , secure and peaceful nuclear technologies , " its website says			0
among its endeavors , the agency tries to verify that countries correctly and completely account for their nuclear material and activities			0
the agency says as of december 31 , it had " safeguards agreements in force " with 179 official countries , and @entity62			0
@entity0 's @entity63 and @entity64 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 says @entity3 is not allowing proper *inspections* of its nuclear program
the director 's report shows @entity3 has upgraded its uranium enrichment centrifuges
