how many of you have felt victimized by a @entity1 ? if you raised your hand , you can attest that even a decade later " @entity3 " still holds up			1
whether it 's because @entity11 's script so authentically captures the high school experience or because of the multiple quote - worthy lines ( admit it , you are glad " fetch " happened ) , the film about a group of teen girls who rule the school and the girl they sort of take under their wing is as popular now as it ever was			1
" for the high - school genre , @entity11 's hilarious script was unusually astute and provocative , " the @entity15 said of the film in 2013			1
" replicating teen doublespeak with brilliant authenticity , the dialogue was full of zingers , accounting for its continued life online			0
" april 30 marks the 10 - year anniversary of the now cult classic			2
not only can the 2004 movie be seen in heavy rotation on cable stations , but thanks to @entity30 anyone can enjoy the adventures of " the @entity3			1
" social media has also fully embraced it with @entity34 and trending hashtags devoted to the characters and their snappy dialogue			0
before gay rights were even being fully embraced , the movie offered up the loveable character of @entity41 , who was " too gay to function " and partial to singing @entity44 's songs in the school talent show			0
and for those who have witnessed the train wreck that has become the life and career of " @entity3 " star @entity51 , it also serves as a bittersweet time capsule of the days when she was billed as one of the most promising young actresses of her generation			1
based on the 2002 nonfiction book " @entity59 " by @entity58 , actress and screenwriter @entity11 was able to find the funny in what is often the victimization of young women in school			1
in the film , @entity3 is a 16 - year - old daughter of zoologist parents who moves from @entity68 to the @entity69 and is enrolled in public school after having been home schooled			1
she quickly catches the attention of the @entity3 , a clique of girls who indoctrinate her into their ways , including rules about what days to wear pink and the fact that " ex-boyfriends are off - limits to friends			1
that 's just , like , the rules of feminism			0
" when friends become bullies what follows is a war of manipulation , lies and revenge			0
@entity11 told the @entity93 that it was all quite familiar			1
" i revisited high school behaviors of my own â€” futile , poisonous , bitter behaviors that served no purpose , " @entity11 said			1
" that thing of someone saying ' you 're really pretty ' and then , when the other person thanks them , saying , ' oh , so you agree ? you think you 're pretty ? ' that happened in my school			0
that was a bear trap			0
" in fact , " @entity3 " has become a sort of cultural shorthand for machiavellian - type machinations -- as well as a favored pop culture reference			1
during the 2013 government shutdown , the " mean girls of @entity113 " @entity111 blog grew in popularity , and when @entity116 won a 2013 @entity117 , she said " i wish this was like ' @entity3 ' and i could just break this ( award ) up and throw it at all of you because you 're all responsible			2
" the movie grossed just over $ 129 million worldwide and helped cement the career of @entity51 and launch others , including @entity125 , who told the @entity126 it was her " best work			1
" " i look back and i 'm like , ' really , i thought i was doing a terrible job , " @entity125 said			2
" but it was written so well and so wonderfully directed			0
( director ) @entity130 made me look good ; he made me funny			0
and @entity11 wrote the coolest script of all time			2
i 'm so grateful for every experience			0
" the film is still so popular that news that a musical is in the works has been greeted with panting anticipation from diehard fans			0
in october 2013 ( and no , not on october 3 , the date that has significant meaning to @entity144 in the film ) , @entity11 's husband , composer @entity140 -- who is scoring the musical -- told @entity145 that progress was being made in developing it			2
so , while you wait , and in honor of " @entity3 , " grab your @entity3 or whatever you use to trash people ( around here we call it " the comments section " ) , sit back and maybe revisit the movie			2
do it for @entity156 .			0
