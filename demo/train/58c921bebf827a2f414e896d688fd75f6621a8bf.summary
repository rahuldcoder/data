-- @entity1 says it will lift restrictions on tourism in the zone around the @entity6 nuclear power plant in 2011 , formally opening the scene of the world 's worst nuclear accident to visitors			1
a limited number of visitors already are allowed into the 30 - kilometer ( 19 - mile ) exclusion zone around the @entity6 nuclear power plant , which exploded and burned in 1986			1
the @entity1 government will present a detailed plan for lifting the remaining restrictions on travel to the area december 21 , said @entity19 , the former @entity21 republic 's emergency situations minister			1
background radiation in the accident zone is still well above normal			0
but far from being a wasteland , wildlife has rebounded in the exclusion zone and trees are reclaiming the ghost city of @entity29 , said @entity30 , author of " @entity31 , " a 2005 book on the area			2
" it is very moving and interesting and a beautiful monument to technology gone awry , " @entity30 said			1
the april 1986 accident killed 32 plant workers and firefighters directly , and the @entity39 estimates nearly 4,000 more will die of related cancers from the radioactive material released by the disaster			0
currently , guides from the @entity44 take about 20 to 30 people into the exclusion zone a day during the summers , said @entity48 , whose @entity50 - based travel agency , @entity51 , books tours to the site			1
the tours typically take between five and six hours , not counting the drive to and from the @entity1 capital @entity57 , he said			1
while travel is no longer restricted to scientists and researchers , " the only way to enter the zone ( now ) is with a certified guide on a certified tour group , " @entity48 said			0
" that 's a huge restriction			0
" guides monitor radiation levels and " know where the people can go and where the people can not go , " he said			2
@entity30 said tourists should wear " something that you would n't mind leaving behind in case it does get dirty			0
" but most radioactive material has sunk into the soil , and visitors receive a dose comparable to the exposure they would receive on a trans - @entity84 flight			0
" the only concern i would have is if too many people come in and it becomes this nuclear @entity87 , " @entity30 said			2
" that would take away from a wildlife sanctuary ( that has thrived ) in the absence of people			2

@entity1 will present plans to open @entity6 next week
author says the site is " very moving and interesting "
