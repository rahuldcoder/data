-- as @entity2 and other countries stare into the financial abyss , questions are being raised about whether the @entity5 should be bailing out failing economies as the only institution with sufficient funds available to act on several fronts at once			1
but although the @entity5 may have the resources to help pull @entity2 and other cash - strapped eurozone nations back from the brink , bank president @entity10 says @entity5 intervention can not be the answer			1
" what makes you think becoming the lender of last resort for governments is actually the thing you need to keep the eurozone together ? " @entity10 said at a press conference last week			0
what is the @entity5 's traditional role ? the @entity5 was established in 1998 after the @entity27 -- known as the @entity27 -- created the structure for what would become the euro currency			1
the @entity5 's mandates are to control inflation and ensure some level of stability for the 17 countries that use the euro currency			1
like other central banks , the @entity5 's main tool for attaining these goals is by raising or lowering interest rates -- a key tool for influencing financial markets			1
the @entity5 's primary remit is to control inflation around 2 % or below			1
it also keeps money flowing through the eurozone 's economy by lending cash ( known as providing liquidity ) to the sovereigns in return for holding collateral , or bonds , of those states			0
the bloc 's financial structure allowed , however , each eurozone country to retain their own tax policies , budgets and banks and issue their own bonds			0
it is this lack of integration which is often pointed to as being a key contributing factor in the eurozone crisis -- not to mention a lack of fiscal responsibility by member countries , according to @entity68 , senior strategist at @entity69			0
" the @entity5 could 've been shouting across the rooftops that too many euro members were not obeying the rules that were set in stone before the eurozone came into being in terms of deficit and debt , " he said			0
how has that role changed during the crisis ? while the @entity5 's power was initially limited to controlling interest rates , as the global financial crisis deepened @entity85 leaders authorized the bank to begin buying government debt in order to stabilize countries ' bond yields -- the rate a country must pay to borrow money to pay its bills			1
if investors lose confidence that a country will pay back its debts , fewer investors will by the country 's bonds , which in turn will drive the rate up			2
@entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 were all forced to seek bailouts once their 10 - year bond yield , or rate , surpassed and remained above the 7 % mark for an extended period of time			0
since august the @entity5 has bought billions of euros worth of @entity2 bonds in attempt to keep @entity2 well below this " @entity116 " -- but on november 9 @entity2 's bond yield surged to a euro - era high of 7.3 % amid fears that the eurozone 's third largest economy could collapse			1
some investors and economists see the @entity5 as the only @entity85 institution with the capacity to respond quickly to the crisis in @entity2			2
why does n't the @entity5 want to continue buying @entity2 bonds ? as international lenders desert @entity2 , the @entity5 is now in the uncomfortable position of being seen as a potential lender of last resort for nations that can no longer borrow from the private sector			1
the @entity5 is reluctant to do so , however , because the bank believes the practice would merely gloss over serious economic problems in eurozone countries and discourage them from enacting austerity measures in order to bring their debts under control			2
" once you 've put that ' lender of last resort ' thing out there , the perception will be ( that cash - strapped countries will ) be automatically bailed out , " said @entity68			0
" but financial stability can only occur if countries have discipline			0
" experts say @entity2 needs to enact reforms that will boost economic growth , not just cut spending , to stabilize its debts -- and @entity5 leaders remain opposed to expanding the bank 's balance sheet with risky sovereign debt			1
still , other analysts say the @entity5 may quietly increase its purchases of @entity2 bonds if the government demonstrates a commitment to getting its fiscal house in order			1
what else can the @entity5 do ? while buying bonds is currently an integral part of the strategy to keep @entity2 from collapse , experts say any successful approach must be more comprehensive if it is to work			1
" buying bonds ca n't be the total modus operandi " , said @entity68			0
" the @entity5 will have to do a combination of things to ( prevent @entity2 default )			2
" the @entity5 could lower interest rates in an attempt to encourage growth in eurozone countries , although some experts doubt a rate drop would make a much of a difference			2
@entity85 leaders could also pass legislation to allow the @entity5 to print billions of euros to pay off sovereign debt , but experts say that would only devalue the euro , cause inflation and undermine the bank 's credibility			2
" if that was the easy solution it would 've been done , " said @entity68			0
" if the @entity5 printed money , the soundness of the bank would be seriously questioned			0
" @entity0 's @entity200 and @entity202 's @entity201 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 's primary mandate is to control inflation through interest rate changes
@entity5 has been buying @entity2 bonds since august to try to keep yields low
the bank has repeatedly said the bond - buying *program* is a temporary measure
