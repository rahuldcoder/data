" everything 's made of solid concrete , " @entity50 said			2

@entity94 near hurricane strength ; watch extends to @entity97 @entity98 made landfall in southern @entity100 a few days ago , and was expected to work its way toward @entity20			0
but @entity7 , which is much stronger , has stopped @entity98 's movement toward @entity20 and has been spinning it around			1
