@entity0 , @entity1 -- money , time zones , flags , water , ships : just a few of the issues to deal with when you divorce one country and prepare to join another			1
the @entity13 leadership of @entity1 is now issuing declarations on an almost hourly basis about the practical consequences of joining the @entity17 , even as much of the rest of the world says the whole process is illegal			1
their biggest headache is geographical : @entity1 has no land border with @entity17			1
the closest link is a windswept ferry crossing in the far north - eastern corner of @entity1 that connects @entity27 with the @entity17 mainland			1
the town 's mayor told @entity2 last week that a bridge will be built across the 4.5 - kilometer wide @entity32 to mother @entity17 , as promised by @entity17 prime minister @entity34 , but that 's a multi-year project			1
then there are other challenges			0
military there are still thousands of @entity40 troops based in @entity1 , and for many of them it is home			1
their fate is far from clear			0
the new @entity1 authorities say they can stay in uniform if they swear allegiance to @entity1 , or leave			2
those wishing to " return " to @entity40 would be given safe passage , without their weapons			2
the @entity40 government continues to insist the bases will not be evacuated			0
@entity40 's deputy prime minister @entity56 said monday that " if the @entity1 authorities try to force the @entity40 military out , the @entity40 military has the right to use force			1
" for now there is a stand - off , with the @entity40 saying that -- for several days at least -- an agreement has been reached that allows supplies to reach the troops still holed up in bases and surrounded by @entity17 troops			1
there 's been no word from @entity72 on this			0
the new @entity1 government says it intends to take over @entity40 naval vessels currently in @entity1 waters			1
some have been blockaded in a lake after several old @entity17 ships were scuttled			0
but most of the @entity40 navy is in poor shape and would not be much of an asset			0
in fact , the @entity40 admitted this month that only four navy ships were battle - ready , and the fleet 's commander has already switched allegiance			2
money currently @entity90 in @entity1 still dispense hryvnia , the @entity40 currency			1
the ruble is little used in @entity1 and money - changers would rather have your euros or dollars			0
@entity1 plans to have its own central bank , tied closely to that of @entity17 , and adopt the ruble as the official currency in april			1
in practical terms , it 's likely that some banks in @entity1 will start working in rubles while others -- for the time - being -- will use the hryvnia			1
the new @entity1 leader , @entity107 , says he expects @entity1 to be a dual - currency state for a while , and the regional parliament voted monday to allow the hryvnia to remain an official currency until 2016			1
for its part , @entity40 's central bank has no plans to starve @entity1 of currency , because it could wipe out the savings of @entity40 living in @entity1 , according to a bank official who spoke to @entity2 's @entity118 on monday			1
the @entity17 deputy finance minister , @entity119 , has floated the idea of a special tax regime for @entity1 while the new authorities adapt laws and tax regulations to conform with those of @entity17 and businesses and properties are re-registered			1
but @entity1 will also need an infusion of @entity17 cash , especially if @entity131 sanctions extend beyond visa restrictions and asset freezes for a few prominent individuals and start impacting businesses in @entity1			1
in the past the region has received hefty subsidies from the @entity40 government as one of the poorer parts of the country			2
the average wage in @entity1 is $ 240 a month , far lower than that of @entity17 , according to data from the @entity145			1
analysts say @entity17 may have to pump from $ 1 to $ 3 billion each year into the @entity1 government 's budget if pensions and other benefits are to be raised to @entity17 levels - at a time when several other @entity17 regions are close to insolvent			1
water and power between 80 and 90 % of @entity1 's water comes from @entity40			1
a canal brings water supplies from the @entity159 across the @entity160 of @entity161 and into the @entity1 peninsula			0
with warm , dry summers and low rainfall ( 15 inches a year ) , @entity1 needs that water to irrigate its arable land			2
@entity40 says it has no intention of cutting off water supplies , perhaps because it in turn relies on @entity17 as a source of natural gas ( and owes @entity17 provider @entity172 $ 2 billion on that debt )			1
to cut off @entity1 's water would look like a vindictive and indiscriminate gesture from a country desperate for western support			1
@entity17 could build a water pipeline under the @entity32 into @entity1 , using water from the @entity179 , but it would be an expensive long - term project			1
two - thirds of the peninsula 's gas supplies come from the @entity40 state - owned supplier @entity186			2
@entity1 's coal - fired power plants supply only one - tenth of the electricity it needs			2
the rest comes from @entity40			0
if @entity17 had to supply @entity1 with most of its power needs , pipelines and pylons would have to be built			1
which leads us to ...			0
energy resources on monday , the @entity1 parliament passed a resolution to seize the assets in @entity1 of two @entity40 energy producers			2
one is the state - owned @entity186 , which has drilling rigs off @entity1 's west coast and in the @entity203			2
the parliament 's resolution said the takeover would include ownership of the region 's " continental shelf and the exclusive ( maritime ) economic zone			0
" this could be very problematic			0
while a land border would look relatively straightforward ( even if rejected by @entity216 ) , disputes on maritime boundaries would not , as @entity1 's coastline is dotted by islands and spits of land			1
the @entity221 and @entity203 seas are estimated to hold nearly 60 trillion cubic feet of gas			0
several offshore fields being developed are close to both @entity1 and the @entity40 mainland and may become a flashpoint as the crisis evolves			2
on tuesday , the @entity40 justice minister , @entity227 , described the attempted confiscation of @entity40 assets as " an act of thievery made by those people who are part of the @entity235 government			0
" while losing a few railway locomotives is bearable when you are virtually bankrupt , losing oil and gas revenues is not			0
the crisis may also deter western oil companies from investing in exploration			0
@entity244 has already put on hold its pursuit of one block			0
none will want to be associated with a government the @entity250 and @entity251 has declared illegitimate			0
flags already lowered and raised			0
the vivid blue and yellow of @entity40 is gone ( though police cars will need repainting )			0
now the @entity17 and @entity1 flags flutter side - by - side : both red , white and blue , but slightly different			2
time zones the new leadership in @entity1 has already announced that on march 30 it will align the republic with @entity72 time -- two hours ahead of @entity40 's in winter months			1
this would mean dark mornings in @entity0			0
on @entity266 , the sun rises at 7:22am in @entity0			0
in the new time - zone it would rise at 9:22am			0
food wander round a supermarket in @entity0 and it 's soon apparent that most foodstuffs and household goods are coming from , or through , @entity40			2
the profit motive and consumer demand may be enough to ensure this flow continues , but much depends on whether the new border hastily being drawn across northern @entity1 becomes a regular @entity280 crossing or a grim reminder of the frontier that once divided the continent			2
the port of @entity285 provides @entity1 with an alternative but likely more expensive import - export hub			0
its facilities are badly in need of modernization , but a $ 10 billion investment plan proposed by a @entity292 tycoon may be disrupted by the current turmoil and / or sanctions			0
the future ? there have been orderly separations and divisions in the past , most notably that of the @entity300 and @entity301 in 1993 , dubbed the @entity302			0
but that was painstakingly prepared with guidance from international experts			0
@entity1 's rupture from @entity40 has been more sudden			1
integration with all things @entity17 will take much longer , and cost much more , than the rapid political process playing out in @entity72			0
@entity2 's @entity118 and journalist @entity310 contributed to this report .			1

there are issues when you divorce one country and join another , writes @entity2 's @entity318
the biggest headache is geographical : @entity1 has no land border with @entity17
there are still thousands of @entity40 troops based in @entity1 -- seen as their home
currently @entity90 in @entity1 still dispense hryvnia , the @entity40 currency
