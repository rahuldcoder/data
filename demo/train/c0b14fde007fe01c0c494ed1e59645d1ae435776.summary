-- i 'm reading a terribly sad book these days			2
it 's a book that i thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second - year medical school , and renew in me a sense of hope			1
it 's called " the @entity12 to win , " and it 's a memoir of @entity11 's 2008 presidential campaign			1
when i 'm finished with my patient write - ups at night and get into bed , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away			2
the election turned out to be a landslide , and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour			0
my classmates cried with joy , and my parents saved every newspaper they could find			0
a young team of visionaries was headed for the @entity30 , and the nation was ready for change			2
during @entity11 's transition to office in 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating			1
there was something in the air			0
and then i close the book			0
cutting to the present is a rude awakening , like snapping out of a dream			0
it 's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory , a sad reminder of opportunities gone by			1
@entity50 indeed happened , in the years since i cast my first ballot			0
it was simply nothing i could have imagined			0
i credit @entity11 with great and varied accomplishments , from the passage of the @entity55 to our military exit from @entity58 , the end of " do n't ask do n't tell , " to the killing of @entity61			1
moreover , i believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at @entity70 , among others			1
but , after the countless times in which i have found myself defending the @entity11 administration to colleagues and peers , i 've reached a limit to the explanations that i can provide			1
i 've reached a point of political despair			0
@entity81 obstructionism can not explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders , nor having drones strike innocent children overseas			1
it can not explain having the @entity87 collect data on the private lives of @entity90 , nor prosecuting whistle - blowers who reveal government wrongdoing			0
it can not account for assassinating @entity95 , an @entity90 citizen , without a trial , nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns			0
it can not justify the findings of a report that says the @entity30 's efforts to silence the media are the " most aggressive ... since the @entity105 "			1
and , most recently , it can not excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the @entity55 was signed into law			1
i do n't know if this is what i should have expected			2
if , at 18 years old , i was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it			0
obviously , elective office is n't a predictable course , as the opposing political party and random events , such as the @entity120 massacre , will shape our public conversation			2
yet , of all of the examples that i have listed above , they largely seem to be of the administration 's own choosing			2
that is what troubles me most of all			0
i voted for @entity11 again in 2012 , but not because i was excited by his candidacy			1
@entity131 presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions			0
i felt that a second term for @entity11 , free from the pressures of future elections , would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long			1
still , as @entity11 's approval rating sank below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder			1
it makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared			0
this week i was reading the portion of the book describing how @entity11 suffered a huge loss to @entity147 in the @entity149 primary			1
at a post-mortem campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause			2
" ' i want us to get our mojo back , ' he said			0
' we 've got to remember who we are			0
' " it 's five years later , mr. president , and i could n't agree with you more			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

@entity166 : i voted for president @entity11 twice , *sharing* hope in *possibility* of change
he says @entity11 has had *worthy* efforts *thwarted* by @entity81 obstructionism
@entity166 : obstructionism ca n't excuse @entity55 website woes , drone attacks
@entity166 : @entity11 's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been
