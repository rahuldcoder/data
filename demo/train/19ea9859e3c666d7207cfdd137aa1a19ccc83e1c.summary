it 's a breathtaking scenario			2
hundreds of petrol - heads roaring across some of @entity4 's most stunning landscapes in a grueling two - week endurance race where the competitors are at the mercy of treacherous terrain			1
the @entity10 's 465 competitors speed through the daunting sand dunes of @entity13 desert one day , and traverse the snow - capped @entity14 mountain range the next in a 9,000 - kilometer coast - to - coast marathon taking in @entity18 , @entity19 and , this year , @entity20			1
but environmentalists are worried about the effect the event -- which attracts millions of spectators -- has on a continent that is home to a wealth of fragile ecosystems			2
@entity18 ecological group @entity28 has accused officials of failing to conduct the necessary environmental impact assessments before ratifying the route of the race , which ends on sunday			1
" the first issue to be analyzed is regulation , " @entity28 president dr. @entity33 told @entity34			0
" in @entity18 , for the last rally , a lot of regulations were not accomplished by the race organizers and even local government			1
" the environmental impact assessment is mandatory , and these kind of things were never presented and accomplished			2
" however , race director @entity45 insists the @entity46 is only staged in areas where it has permission to go			2
" where we are going to go with the @entity46 , we are authorized to go , " @entity45 told @entity34			0
" that means we work all the year with all the administration in each country to get permission to go where it 's possible to go			2
" the @entity46 is like a cocktail			0
which means you need to put in a lot of ingredients			0
every year we chose the best places for the best sport in the event			1
" this year , with three countries , we have a fantastic route with a lot of different landscapes , very different every day			1
a level of difficulty is very important every day			0
with the three countries , we are really in the best position to have the best route for the 2012 edition			1
" but @entity73 counters that this desire to find the most dramatic and challenging landscapes is taking the rally into terrains which are not ready for the barrage of vehicles -- which come in four categories : cars , motorbikes , quadbikes and trucks			0
. " most of the adventure of the @entity46 is to use natural landscapes and scenery , " @entity33 said			0
" our region , @entity18 , @entity19 and now @entity20 , are really not prepared for this kind of event , especially environments which have very fragile ecosystems			1
" the @entity46 , first staged in 1979 , is named after the @entity95 capital which once served as its finishing point			0
competitors would set off from the @entity99 capital of @entity100 , in the shadow of the iconic @entity102 , and make tracks through north @entity104 to @entity95 and , for the victorious few , racing immortality			0
a test of courage , stamina , strength and skill , the @entity46 relocated to @entity4 in 2009 after the murder of a @entity99 family in @entity113 , combined with terrorist threats made against the race , forced the cancellation of the previous year 's event			1
the continental switch has forced competitors to adapt to new sets of laws and regulations in @entity4 , a transition that has thrown up several problems , according to @entity73			1
he and his team took many photos during last year 's installment that claim to show drivers breaking traffic laws on local roads when traveling between stages of the race			1
" during the 2011 rally , it was clear the people taking part in the competition in @entity18 violated ( traffic laws )			1
not during the competition itself , but during connections between stages , " he said			0
" we took more than 180 pictures showing these infractions			0
they put families in danger because at the time it was the holiday season in @entity150			0
" @entity45 insists the @entity46 is committed to doing all it can to ensure race entrants obey local laws during the rally			2
" we work with all the authorities , the police , " he said			0
" they need to respect the law			0
we are increasing the level of control with the full support of all the police authorities in the three countries			2
" organizers have sent the images captured by @entity73 and his colleagues to the 2012 entrants as examples of how not to drive on local roads			2
despite the controversy surrounding the @entity46 , it would seem the rally is a hit with local fans			0
the event 's official website claimed that last year five million spectators across two countries turned out -- 3.5 million in @entity18 and 1.5 million in @entity19			1
and @entity45 revealed that three more nations want to follow @entity20 and join the race			1
" we can imagine including a new country in the next route in 2013			0
at the moment it 's a bit early to speak about it , but we are working on some projects including a new country , " he said			0
" we have good potential there ( in @entity4 ) with a lot of propositions from other countries like @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198			1
" the race 's official website claims that " entering the @entity46 is , in a certain way , like climbing @entity202 , sailing round the globe or rowing round the world			2
" regardless of the political and environmental issues surrounding the rally , the racers who are crowned winners in @entity206 on sunday will have achieved an unforgettable feat.			1

the 33rd edition of the @entity10 will come to a conclusion on sunday
the @entity4 endurance event has attracted the ire of environmental groups
it has been held in @entity18 and @entity19 since 2009 , with @entity20 added this year
