-- hailed as the " world 's greatest golf course " by its owner before it had even opened , @entity1 has a lot to live up to			1
the statement would have been ridiculed by the golfing community had it not been made by a man who has pumped $ 150 million into his dream to date , with plans to spend over $ 1 billion by the time the controversial @entity12 project is completed			1
it has already bulldozed past environmentalists ' concerns , but @entity16 is reluctant to continue development due to a planned offshore wind farm			1
the fact that some of the key names in @entity23 golf attended this month 's opening -- surrounded by bagpipers and the miles of towering sand dunes along its @entity29 coast site -- is testament to the power of his brand			1
the @entity33 billionaire owns a dozen luxury golf resorts -- including @entity36 's faded @entity35 and its renowned " @entity38 " course which he plans to renovate -- but can his @entity40 venture be considered a contender for top spot so early on ? blowing in the wind ? @entity16 threatens to ditch $ 1b @entity12 golf resort of course , criteria for judging the " greatest " vary from golfer to golfer , with emphasis ranging from degree of challenge to spectacular views or history			1
for @entity1 to be considered as one of the greats , it first has to establish itself as a venue among @entity12 links courses			1
that will be no mean feat , with illustrious company including " the home of golf " @entity63 and other current @entity65 venues @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
@entity67 stands out as the most picturesque of those courses , while @entity66 hosts the world 's oldest golf club and @entity69 is often regarded as the toughest			1
on the other side of the @entity76 , there are the two outstanding links courses currently vying to host an @entity65 ; @entity78 and @entity79			1
there 's also hot competition south of the border in @entity83 , including the traditional highly - rated links of @entity85 and this year 's @entity65 venue , @entity87 and @entity88			1
the latter has seen the great amateur golfer @entity90 in 1926 and flamboyant @entity92 @entity91 in 1979 and 1988 among its victors			0
@entity1 is starting on the back foot against its @entity40 rivals , but with broadcast cables already running beneath the course and a plan in place for several thousand spectators , it has a strong case to one day host major tournaments			2
perhaps a fairer match for the new course would be against eight - year - old @entity105 in @entity106 , which runs along and around ridges on a secluded stretch of jagged coastline			0
it has already jumped up magazine rankings and attracted visitors from around the world with its spectacular views			0
the edge that @entity1 possesses is that it can be classed as links golf , which is favored by purists as the " true " setting for the game			2
acclaimed @entity83 golf architect @entity119 has skilfully routed holes around and between the massive dunes , some measuring 80 feet in height			0
his family business has worked on course designs for a hundred years and put its hand to several @entity65 venues			0
to get to the very top , @entity16 's new creation must surpass several private and exclusive courses in his home country , which have dominated magazine rankings for decades			1
@entity133 in @entity134 boasts some of the most dramatic holes in the world , playing over @entity138 bays where seals bask on the rocks amid crashing waves			0
the course was styled by @entity143 -- a renowned architect who also designed @entity144 , the lush and colorful @entity145 setting for the annual @entity146 since 1934			0
most golfers can only dream of setting foot on these courses , along with @entity150 in @entity151 , often considered the most perfect example of golf architecture on land that -- unlike the stunning natural beauty that awaits players at @entity1 -- was previously unremarkable			2
the notable exception to the top - ranked private clubs in the @entity33 is @entity159 , the picturesque @entity134 coastal course which is a video - game favorite and open to the public			2
it 's not cheap though , with a round costing $ 495 per person			2
one venue that every other struggles to compete with is @entity63 ' @entity167 , which is at the top of every golfer 's bucket list			0
it might not be the most dramatic or challenging course but it will always be the home of the game , where hard wooden balls were thrashed around wasteland almost six hundred years ago			0
@entity1 can not compete with the history of its @entity12 neighbors and it wo n't echo the exclusivity and originality of some of its @entity33 cousins			1
unlike many of its iconic rivals , it has no " signature " hole , but is comprised of a series of stern but fair tests that will suit different players according to personal preference			0
however , as it matures into its " championship course " billing with the backing of the professional game 's organizers , it certainly has a fighting chance of one day becoming the most dramatic of tournament venues			0
