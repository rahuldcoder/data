-- @entity1 suspended a mandatory online course that asked students and faculty about their sex lives and drinking habits following backlash from the school community			1
the @entity10 public university started using the third - party online course this semester as part of required " @entity14 training " on sexual violence prevention			1
questions such as : " how many times have you had sex ? " and " with how many different people have you had sex ? " raised privacy concerns among students			1
@entity1 junior @entity24 said she appreciates the school 's efforts to educate the community on sexual violence prevention , especially in light of recent headlines related to domestic violence in the @entity31			1
but , schools should be able to educate students without asking how many times they 've had sex in the past three months , or if drugs or alcohol were involved , @entity24 said			1
" this is not information that i discuss with my friends , let alone information i feel the need to disclose to the school or whoever the third - party source may be , " @entity24 , 20 , told @entity0 in an email			0
" as a questionnaire that is supposed to serve the purpose of educating students on gender equality to prevent sexual violence , why should there be questions regarding how much sex a student has had and if they used drugs , alcohol , or a condom ? " the controversy comes as schools across the country are experimenting with new approaches to sexual harassment prevention and education to comply with federal law			1
sexual violence prevention in higher education has been a concern for schools across the country amid widespread allegations that schools mishandled sexual misconduct incidents in violation of federal law			0
mandatory sexual violence education programming is common in schools nationwide			0
the @entity77 said this week that at least 500 freshmen could face holds on spring registration if they do not complete mandatory sexual harassment training this semester			0
the @entity81 launched a task force earlier this year dedicated to the issue , and unveiled a new public awareness and education campaign on friday called " it 's on @entity86			2
" the program , which president @entity88 and vice president @entity89 announced friday , aims to engage students and colleges to take active roles in preventing sexual assault on campus			0
@entity1 's @entity14 training module was stirring debate on campus as more people started taking it , @entity24 said			1
a @entity101 article on the program brought the conversation to the national level , prompting @entity1 to suspend the program wednesday pending further " review and revision			2
" " we felt it was important to take those concerns seriously , " @entity108 , dean of students and associate vice president for student affairs , told @entity0			0
" we are very committed to not only meeting federal requirements , but also assuring that we will provide critically important training and education to all members of our community			2
" @entity24 also questioned the extent to which her responses would be treated anonymously considering she used her name and student @entity123 number to register for the online course			2
but @entity108 said the responses were " captured anonymously " and would not be identifiable by the school or @entity127 , the vendor that created the module			0
" at the conclusion , we would gather it in aggregate and it would give us a better picture of campus culture and give us an opportunity to identify additional educational and training needs			0
" the questions were included among other slides related to campus resources and exercises in how to deal with potential scenarios , @entity108 said			2
on the whole , the course was intended to address requirements under @entity14 to make students aware of resources for dealing with sexual violence and how to report sexual misconduct , she said			1
schools that receive federal funding are required under the @entity151 to provide sexual violence education to new and returning students and employees			0
guidance under @entity14 issued by the @entity156 in 2001 and 2014 also makes clear that schools should be providing educational programs on sexual violence to their student body , said @entity161 with the professional group @entity162 in @entity164			1
surveys are not required by @entity14 and @entity151 , and schools do not have to purchase surveys or educational programs from third parties , @entity161 said			1
there are several models schools can adapt , including @entity81 guidelines			0
" by designing their own survey , schools can insure that the survey questions are non-invasive " @entity161 said .			0

@entity1 's " @entity14 " online training included questions about sex , alcohol and drug use
" how many times have you had sex in past three months ? " among questions asked
students said they were concerned over how the responses would be used
@entity1 says questions were anonymous , would be used to improve education programs
