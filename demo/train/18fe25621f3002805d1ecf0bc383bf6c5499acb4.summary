editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			0
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- at the foot of @entity24 , in the @entity19 of @entity20 , a lush and expansive forest named @entity22 sits dauntingly			1
local residents are told from an early age to avoid it altogether , as its sheer volume leaves little question that a curious youngster will be unable to find his or her way out of thickets that have become synonymous with a dark mythology			0
though the area has served as a respite for the peaceful elderly suicides of yore , today it has devolved into the country 's ultimate destination of despondent citizens suffering under the pressures of @entity20 's notoriously driven and achievement - based culture			1
@entity22 is now the site of 50 to 100 suicides each year			1
earlier this year , @entity9 contacted @entity48 , a geologist who for more than 30 years has patrolled @entity22 studying the land , serving as an environmental conservationist and stumbling upon the not infrequent dead body			1
a sweet , conscientious and demure man , it is strange to consider the amount of solitary carnage he has encountered			0
he 's come to act as a sort of counselor to the many people he finds contemplating death along @entity22 's pathways			1
see the rest of @entity62 at @entity9 as he led us into @entity22 , so creepily scored with the echo of birds and crackling brush , the idea that @entity48 was sane at all seemed almost impossible			1
that we 'd find a dead body , to us at least , was entirely possible -- so much so that when we did in fact stumble on what @entity48 judged as a suicide from at least a year before , and were left staring at the decomposed corpse , we were shocked it had n't happened sooner			2
over the course of our time with @entity48 , this eerie side of @entity20 culture came into clearer focus			2
he explained to us the numerous ways its citizenry is called on to excel -- and how the subsequent feelings of inadequacy mislead and often overwhelm			0
it paints a sweeping and telling portrait that a sole stretch of forest , born centuries before in the wake of a volcanic eruption , could come to represent to so many the only way of escaping the ways and pressures and apparent failures of an entire nation .			0

the @entity22 is @entity20 's most *popular* suicide destination
@entity102 , expansive land is the final resting place for 50 - 100 people a year
geologist patrols the land , discovering bodies and counseling at - risk people
