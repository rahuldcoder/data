@entity0 -- the @entity3 's top @entity2 said tuesday he will force a vote this week on whether to open debate on tougher gun laws , increasing pressure on legislators from both parties negotiating a possible compromise on a package that some @entity12 have threatened to filibuster			1
a @entity12 filibuster would mean senate majority leader @entity15 needs 60 votes on thursday just to begin @entity3 consideration of the package based on proposals by president @entity20 in the aftermath of the @entity23 school massacre in december that killed 20 first - graders and six educators			1
@entity20 has made gun measures a major focus of his second term agenda , holding events across the country to push for @entity31 to vote on the package			1
background checks on gun sales : how do they work ? he spoke monday in @entity37 , the state where the @entity23 shootings occurred , and vice president @entity39 made a similar call for action at the @entity42 on tuesday			2
@entity15 told reporters he hoped to get a bipartisan deal before the procedural vote on thursday			1
talks involving @entity48 sen. @entity47 and @entity49 sen. @entity49 of @entity50 have focused on a compromise on expanding background checks of gun buyers			1
@entity47 indicated late on tuesday the two were close to an agreement and have scheduled a news conference for wednesday morning			2
a @entity47 aide told @entity1 they are " hopeful " to have a deal to announce			0
@entity1 poll : background checks popular , worrisome separately , @entity48 leaders appear increasingly optimistic they will get enough @entity12 votes to overcome a threatened filibuster on starting debate			1
@entity48 believe as many as a dozen @entity12 will side with them and that will more than make up for the handful of pro-gun @entity48 who might not			2
at least five @entity12 have publicly opposed the filibuster pledged by 14 of their @entity3 colleagues , including @entity12 leader sen. @entity70 of @entity71			1
@entity72 later told reporters his filibuster threat referred to the specific package approved by the @entity77 and indicated he might be open to a compromise			1
sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , said tuesday she favored opening debate on the bill as long as amendments can be offered , adding : " i think it 's an important debate to have and i do not believe we should block the motion to proceed			2
" without a deal , a successful @entity12 filibuster would stop consideration of the gun legislation before any votes on specific provisions			1
@entity48 leaders want to give senators from both parties ample opportunity to amend the bill and are prepared to debate it beyond a scheduled recess the first week of may , if doing so will increase chances of passage			2
" the way you put together a coalition to pass the bill is to allow as many amendment votes as you can			0
we are willing to take the time to do that and have that process , " a @entity48 leadership aide told @entity1			0
@entity20 's rhetoric has reflected the political uncertainty , with the president and his aides using increasingly personal language intended to shame @entity12 into allowing public votes on measures that have public support but are fiercely opposed by the influential @entity119			1
opinion : why the @entity119 fights background checks " if senators do n't have the guts to go on the record to vote how they feel on this issue ... that would be a shame and that would be a disservice to their constituents , " @entity42 spokesman @entity122 told reporters on tuesday			2
at a later @entity42 event intended to keep up the public profile of the issue , @entity39 said @entity12 efforts to block tougher gun laws showed they were in a " time warp " because public support on issues such as expanded background checks " has moved beyond where it was five , ten , even three years ago			1
" on the other side , the @entity119 and its supporters in @entity31 argue the @entity48 proposals threaten the constitutional right to bear arms , and also offer ineffective responses intended as political show instead of real solutions to the problem of gun violence in @entity153			0
" on firearms questions , on @entity157 questions , there 's a divide in this country , " @entity119 president @entity154 told @entity1			2
" to call it an ideological divide is too simple because it 's a cultural divide			0
when something happens , the folks on the other side from us say , ' well the problem 's the gun , we need to do something about guns			2
' " defeat of the entire package in the @entity48 - led @entity3 would kill gun legislation for now , which would be a stinging defeat for @entity20 and @entity48 pushing for tougher laws			1
however , a public perception that @entity12 blocked popular proposals such as expanding background checks of gun buyers could harm @entity12 prospects in 2014 and 2016 among moderates they need to have any chance of countering strong support for @entity48 by minority demographics such as @entity185 , @entity186 and the gay - lesbian vote			1
with the high political stakes come hardball tactics and strategies			0
the @entity119 has long kept a comprehensive scorecard of the voting records of legislators on gun issues , which it combines with campaign contributions to try to influence elections			0
in response , a group led by @entity199 mayor @entity198 called @entity201 announced this week it was launching its own scorecard to identify members of @entity31 who vote against tougher gun laws			1
" we 're asked many times daily where people 's elected representatives are on gun laws , and we intend to tell them , in detail , " said @entity205 , director of the group of more than 900 mayors , of the campaign that will feature more than $ 1 million in cable television ads. why is this so hard ? the disconnect on background checks while most of the 12 legislators targeted by the ads are @entity12 , some are democrats from conservative - leaning states , such as rural @entity225 states where hunting and sport shooting are popular			1
the @entity77 passed a package of gun laws proposed by @entity20 in the @entity23 attack by a lone gunman			1
proposals in the committee 's package included expanding background checks on gun buyers , toughening laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases , banning semi-automatic rifles modeled after military assault weapons as well as large - capacity ammunition magazines , and coming up with ideas for improving school safety			1
the weapons ban , which would update a similar 1994 law that expired a decade later , already has been dropped , though @entity15 , @entity247 , has promised a floor vote on it as an amendment to the package			1
@entity15 and the @entity42 are pushing hard for expanding background checks to all gun purchases to close a loophole that exempts private sales , such as transactions at gun conventions			1
should anyone be able to buy guns ? share your views on tuesday , @entity15 made a highly personal reference to his own perspective on the issue			1
noting that his home state requires a three - day waiting period to pick up a newly purchased gun , @entity15 contended the delay saved lives			2
" sometimes people in a fit of passion purchase a handgun to do bad things with it -- even as my dad did , kill themselves , " he said			0
" waiting a few days helps			0
requiring a simple background check every time a gun is sold is common sense			0
" if @entity12 managed to filibuster the full gun package , @entity15 said later that he would find a way to introduce each component individually to force votes			1
" it will take a little bit of time but as i 've said for months now , the @entity153 people deserve a vote -- on background checks , on federal trafficking , on safety in schools , on the size of clips , and yes - assault weapons			0
" @entity39 sounded incredulous that @entity3 @entity12 would consider blocking full consideration of legislation that matters to so many @entity186 , as demonstrated by polls that indicate overwhelming support across the spectrum for expanded background checks			2
for @entity302 , a wounded life has a new purpose " a tragedy that traumatized a nation and caught the attention of the entire world ... and the climax of this tragedy could be we 're not even going to get a vote ? " @entity39 said , adding " i just do n't believe they 'll do this			0
" @entity154 and other opponents worry that an expanded background check system would create a paper trail that could eventually be used to create a national gun registry , which they reject as unconstitutional			0
they also contend it would prove a burden to law - abiding gun owners while doing nothing to stop criminals from getting hold of firearms			0
" the one thing you know today is that if the government creates a record , it 's not secure , " @entity154 said , adding that requiring background checks on all gun sales -- the so - called universal system -- raised the question of " is it linked to a national registration scheme			2
" however , @entity39 accused the @entity119 of spreading false information that the proposed legislation would intrude on @entity157 rights			0
some states already have passed stricter gun laws similar to the federal proposals since the @entity23 shootings			1
they include @entity37 , where the killings occurred , and @entity346 , the site of two other notorious mass shootings that contributed to a renewed gun debate in @entity153			0
from gun hater to @entity119 - loving mom the current background check system was created in 1989			0
it requires federally approved gun dealers to check whether gun buyers have a criminal background or other problem to make them ineligible to purchase a firearm			0
under the system , the gun dealer maintains a record of the transaction , but the federal government keeps no such identifying paperwork			0
according to a @entity369 report , less than 2 % of those seeking to purchase firearms were denied due to background checks from 1998 through 2009			0
opponents cite that figure as evidence that the system fails to stop illegal weapons sales that the legislation seeks to target , while supporters say the result shows the system keeps some guns out of the hands of the wrong people and the system should be expanded and strengthened			0
a @entity381 last november cited a government report that showed 9,903 of the 14,612 homicides in the nation in 2011 involved firearms			0
@entity1 's @entity386 , @entity387 , @entity388 , @entity389 and @entity390 contributed to this report .			0
