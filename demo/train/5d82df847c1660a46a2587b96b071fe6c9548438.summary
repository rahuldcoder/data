first , the ambitious @entity3 state senator had to fund his 2011 race for mayor of @entity6			1
when he came in fifth , he was stuck with $ 70,000 in campaign debt that he had to retire before he could mount his next run , for secretary of state -- a costly statewide venture			1
and that 's how prosecutors say @entity0 ended up sitting across from an undercover federal agent in a coffee shop in early march , brokering what he was told was a $ 2 million arms deal that would include the purchase of shoulder - fired missiles from @entity22 rebels in the @entity23			1
" do i think we can make some money ? i think we can make some money , " @entity0 told the agent in a conversation recounted in a 137 - page arrest affidavit			1
" do i think we can get the goods ? i think we can get the goods			0
" the veteran @entity32 , an advocate for gun control and campaign finance reform in @entity35 , is now one of about two dozen people charged in a sprawling racketeering case brought by the @entity40 attorney 's office in @entity6			1
his co-defendants include a former @entity6 school board president and a previously - convicted @entity45 mobster dubbed " @entity46			0
" he 's accused of putting his public office up for sale , and promising to push donors ' agendas in @entity35 and in his district in exchange for contributions			1
the allegations have stunned his constituents in @entity6 and its suburbs and cast a shadow over his state @entity60 colleagues , who have suspended @entity0 and two other @entity62 who have run afoul of the law in recent months			1
@entity0 has been free on $ 500,000 bond since his arrest			1
though neither he nor his lawyer have commented to @entity69 on the allegations , the senator pleaded not guilty in a court appearance tuesday morning			2
and he got a sort of backhanded defense from longtime @entity3 powerbroker @entity74			2
" i do n't think any of the allegations are anyplace close to any reality , " @entity74 told @entity69 -- but he said that 's because @entity0 lacked the clout to fulfill any of the pledges he made			1
" there 's no way anyone who is seriously trying to influence government by way of money would do it with @entity0			1
he could n't deliver anything , " said @entity74 , @entity6 's former mayor and onetime speaker of the @entity88			0
' careful and cautious ' the 65 - year - old @entity0 came to the feds ' attention during a five - year probe of the @entity94 , a @entity45 social club that agents describe as the hub of a coast - to - coast criminal enterprise			2
the original focus of the probe was the club 's " dragonhead , " or leader , @entity46 -- a man the affidavit puts at the head of a racketeering ring that had its hands in money laundering , drug dealing , gunrunning , murder - for - hire plots and trafficking in stolen liquor and contraband cigarettes			1
@entity116 's lawyer , @entity115 , proclaimed his client 's innocence to reporters outside the courtroom tuesday			0
@entity116 had pleaded guilty to racketeering in 2000 , got a lighter sentence for cooperating with the government and still wears an ankle monitoring bracelet , court documents say			2
in this case , he fell victim to " agent provocateurs " who tried to lure him into a crime , @entity115 , said after tuesday 's hearing			2
" it 's a case where ultimately the government created the crime , the government financed the crime and the government ensnared my client , tantamount to entrapment , " @entity115 said			2
but according to the court documents , @entity116 had taken two undercover @entity136 agents into his confidence			0
he introduced one , who was posing as a @entity140 member from the @entity141 , to @entity142 , a @entity6 political consultant and former school board president			0
@entity142 started hitting up the agent for contributions for @entity0 , according to the charges			1
the agent refused at first			0
but then he introduced another undercover agent to meet with @entity0 , who offered to " perform certain official acts " in exchange for contributions to pay off his mayoral campaign debt , the affidavit recounts			1
over the course of the next three years , prosecutors say @entity0 raked in about $ 50,000 from undercover agents , with @entity142 acting as an intermediary			2
in exchange , according to the charges , @entity0 lobbied officials in suburban @entity160 on behalf of a fake software company represented by one of the federal agents ; promised to lobby colleagues on behalf of a medical marijuana bill that would have benefited the supposed interest of another donor ; and for $ 6,800 , secured a state @entity60 proclamation honoring the @entity94			1
though @entity0 periodically said he was n't doing anything for his own benefit and raised concerns about crossing the line into unlawful " pay - to - play " tactics , he " never walked away from any quid pro quo requests , " according to the affidavit			2
and eventually , the agents ' relationships with @entity0 led to the coffeehouse last month , where prosecutors say he introduced the supposed @entity141 mobster to a man he said could provide guns and rockets			2
it had taken more than three months of cajoling and another $ 6,000 to get to this point , according to the arrest affidavit			0
the document recounts how @entity142 , who served with @entity0 on the city school board in the 1990s , promised @entity0 's associate could supply " cargo containers full of weapons " from @entity23 insurgents			1
in taking the money , @entity142 told the agent that @entity0 " fully understood " the money was for being introduced to arms dealer : " we just talked about that today , " the affidavit quotes @entity142 as saying			1
@entity142 is accused not only of being @entity0 's bagman but of taking part in other @entity94 schemes , including a murder - for - hire plot			1
but in court papers seeking to continue his release on bail , his attorneys argue that the crimes he 's accused of committing " were all driven by government agents			1
" " the government , despite having apparently targeted mr. @entity142 since 2011 , has not charged mr. @entity142 with one dangerous offense that was not inspired by a government agent , " attorney @entity213 wrote			0
" in short , the government agents created the purported danger that the government now seeks to use to incarcerate mr. @entity142			0
" @entity0 suspected something was up in the weeks before his arrest			1
in february , he said he believed one of his fellow senators " was wearing a ' wire ' for the @entity136			0
' " " senator @entity0 attributed his long career in public office to being careful and cautious , " the arrest affidavit recounts			1
his partner in that conversation ? an @entity136 agent			0
a ' sense of entitlement ' @entity0 has been in public office since 1988 , when he won a seat on the school board			2
he moved on from there to the city 's board of supervisors , then the @entity88 and finally , in 2006 , to the @entity60			0
the son of immigrants who had brought him from @entity240 at age 3 , he grew up to attend the @entity242 and earn a ph.d. in child psychology from the @entity245			0
but despite his longevity , @entity246 was a " loner , " @entity74 said -- and that limited his effectiveness as a legislator			0
" that 's why it 's such a shock to me , " said @entity74 , who once endorsed and later fired the aspiring politico			0
from a " practical , intellectual standpoint , " he said , " you do n't bribe or you do n't launder money or you do n't do things with people who ca n't deliver on public policy			0
" the allegations have rattled many in the city , particularly its ethnic @entity265 community , said @entity246 , the executive director of the @entity267			0
" it 's really out of the line of imagination for somebody who is in public service to be trading arms for campaign donations , " @entity246 said			1
but he said the charges against @entity0 highlight what @entity246 called the " arms race " that campaign finance has become in @entity3 , where it can cost millions to run for even a low - level office			1
" it also demonstrates the sense of entitlement that many of our elected officials feel they have to hold power , " he said			0
@entity0 " wanted at all costs to hold onto power , and i think voters are tired of it			2
" @entity291 , a constituent and @entity0 supporter , said the news of his arrest " surprised all of us			1
" " i mean , he 's living in my neighborhood , " she said			0
" we all backed him			0
" @entity291 said she thought his actions were " an isolated instance " -- one that may prompt a second look at some other local politicians , " but i do n't think it 's an epidemic			0
" @entity0 is the third @entity32 in the @entity60 to face criminal charges in the past year			1
@entity306 was found guilty of perjury and fraudulent voting in january after a jury concluded he was living outside his @entity311 - area district when elected in 2008			0
another @entity3 senator , @entity312 , was charged with taking bribes from undercover @entity136 agents in february			2
@entity246 called himself a " lifelong @entity32			0
" but in the wake of those scandals , he said , @entity319 " are watching the @entity62 in this state and what is going to be done			0
" he urged @entity0 to resign and allow his constituents to have an untainted voice in the @entity60			1
" what purpose does it serve to stay in that position while all this is going on ? " @entity246 asked .			0
