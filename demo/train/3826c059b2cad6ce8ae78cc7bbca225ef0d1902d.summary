-- @entity1 earned its 14th no. 1 at the box office this weekend — out of 14 releases			1
yep , the animation studio , now owned by @entity6 , has never not opened a film in first place			1
its latest release , @entity9 , was no exception			2
it finished at the top of its class			0
monsters graduated with $ 82 million from 4,004 theaters in its debut weekend , making it the second biggest @entity1 opener of all time behind @entity20 , which bowed with $ 110.3 million in june 2010			1
it also beat the opening of its predecessor , @entity25 , which opened with $ 62.6 million in 2001			0
that being said , when inflation is taken into account , @entity25 's debut adjusts to about $ 82 million today ( and that was without @entity32 tickets )			1
according to @entity6 , audiences were 56 percent female and 60 percent below the age of 25			1
families made up 73 percent of business , and teens accounted for a solid 15 percent			0
the film played well with all ages , and crowds issued @entity9 an " a " @entity42 , which should help it endure at the box office for weeks to come			1
@entity0 : ' @entity9 ' review @entity9 's biggest challenge arrives july 3			1
that 's when @entity49 's animated @entity48 hits theaters and will provide direct competition for families			2
the original @entity48 became a word of mouth sensation and earned $ 251 million in 2010 , and because it 's still fresh in audiences ' minds , it provides a formidable threat			2
but @entity6 is confident that positive audience reactions will carry @entity9 to success			1
internationally , @entity9 took in $ 54.5 million this weekend from 35 territories , representing about 48 percent of the overseas market			0
all together , @entity9 has earned $ 136.5 million worldwide in its first three days			0
it should be noted that @entity6 declined to provide a budget for the film			1
last year , the studio reported that @entity64 cost $ 185 million			0
because filmmakers had to bring voice actors @entity68 and @entity69 back into the fold to work on @entity9 , it 's likely that it cost substantially more than that			2
in second place , the @entity74 vehicle @entity73 went totally viral with an excellent $ 66 million debut from 3,607 theaters			1
the zombie thriller , which reportedly cost over $ 200 million to produce ( @entity79 is admitting to $ 190 million ) , had a famously troubled production , but thanks to @entity79 's relentless marketing campaign ( including numerous ads in this year 's hugely popular @entity85 finals ) , @entity73 became the biggest opening of @entity74 's career , ahead of @entity88 , which opened with $ 50.3 million in 2005			1
@entity0 : ' @entity73 ' review @entity73 has a long way to go before it can be deemed a success , but its great box office debut and surprisingly strong reviews have wiped away much of the stigma that surrounded the project			1
of course , the film 's on - set drama did n't matter much to the average moviegoer			1
according to @entity101 , 87 percent of people who purchased a ticket to @entity73 said that the film 's much - reported production struggles had zero effect on their decision to go			1
who was the average moviegoer ? @entity79 reports that crowds were 51 percent female ( yep , both a zombie movie and a monster movie played primarily to females this weekend ) and 67 percent at least 25 years old			2
overseas , @entity73 earned $ 45.8 million from 25 territories representing about 30 percent of the international market , which gives the zombie film a $ 112 million total after just one weekend			1
audiences issued @entity73 a " b + " cinemascore grade			1
@entity117 fell by a hefty 65 percent in its second weekend to $ 41.2 million			0
the $ 225 million @entity120 reboot has now earned $ 210 million after 10 days , easily surpassing @entity121 ' gross , which topped out at $ 200 million in 2006			0
unless it continues to plummet at this rate ( which seems unlikely — @entity73 and @entity9 provided unexpectedly massive competition ) , @entity117 is still on pace to reach the $ 300 million mark			1
@entity0 : ' @entity117 ' review this is the @entity130 rounded out the top five with $ 13 million and $ 7.9 million , respectively			0
this is the @entity130 fell by just 37 percent and has now earned $ 57.8 million against a $ 32 million budget			0
now @entity133 , meanwhile , dropped by just 29 percent and has earned $ 94.5 million after four weekends			0
the $ 75 million magician caper is now a lock to finish above $ 100 million			0
@entity9 -- $ 82 million 2			0
@entity73 -- $ 66 million 3			2
@entity117 -- $ 41.2 million 4			0
this is the @entity130 -- $ 13 million 5			0
now @entity133 -- $ 7.9 million in limited release , @entity139 's buzzy drama @entity138 , which stars @entity140 , expanded too quickly for its own good			2
the film , which opened in five theaters last weekend , expanded into 650 locations and took in $ 2 million			2
its resulting $ 3,077 per theater average limits @entity138 's chances for another major expansion			2
next week , @entity150 and @entity149 hit theaters			0
