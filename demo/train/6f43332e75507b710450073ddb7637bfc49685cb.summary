-- despite supporters ' hopes that this time it 's different , president @entity4 's new call for restricting some semi-automatic rifles and high - capacity magazines will face deeply entrenched resistance in the @entity10 - controlled @entity9 and could be a long shot even in the @entity13 - led @entity12			1
any gun legislation sent to the @entity9 " is going to have to pass with most @entity13 and a few @entity10 , " said @entity14 , deputy editor of the @entity15			1
" this would be an even more high - profile bill			0
" read the proposals and @entity4 's call for @entity23 to reinstate the federal ban on military - style rifles that expired in 2004 " is a further reach than some of the other proposals that are being tossed around , " @entity14 said			1
" there is no way that it is going to pass with a majority of @entity10 support , " he said			2
" that is just the reality of the situation			0
it is going to take virtually all the @entity13 , and all the @entity13 wo n't vote for that			1
" @entity4 and vice president @entity36 laid out a package of measures aimed at reducing gun violence wednesday , just over a month after the december massacre at a @entity42 elementary school			1
the killings of 26 people there followed a july rampage in a movie theater in @entity48 , @entity49 , that left 12 dead and the august attack on a @entity52 temple in @entity53 that killed another six			2
" the world has changed , and it 's demanding action , " said @entity36 , who led a @entity56 task force on gun violence after the @entity42 slayings			1
but before the announcement , local officials in at least three states vowed to resist any new gun controls			0
and @entity66 fans have poured out their vituperation online , some floridly warning of a power grab by the @entity4 administration			1
a look at @entity73 gun laws @entity75 state rep. @entity74 told @entity0 on wednesday that he 'll introduce legislation that would make it illegal to enforce a federal gun ban			1
" we 're going to do everything we can to call people back to the belief and the understanding that we 're a constitutional republic and that our rights do not come from @entity23 , " he said			0
" our rights come from @entity86 and are enumerated in the @entity87			0
" and in a video that spread virally across the @entity93 , the head of a @entity91 gun training and accessory company warned " all you patriots " to " get ready to fight " if the @entity4 administration took steps to restrict firearms			1
" i am not letting my country be ruled by a dictator			0
i 'm not letting anybody take my guns			0
if it goes one inch further , i 'm gon na start killing people , " @entity103 ceo @entity102 vowed			0
in a later video , in which he 's accompanied by his attorney , @entity102 apologized " for letting my anger get the better of me " and cautioned viewers , " it 's not time for any type of violent action			2
" opinion : @entity115 's paranoid fantasy @entity4 on wednesday signed 23 orders that do n't require congressional approval that he said would stiffen background checks on gun buyers and expand safety programs in schools			1
and he called on @entity23 to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds and to require a background check for anyone buying a gun , whether at a store or in a private sale or gun show			0
the steps that require legislative action are likely to bump up against the often - visceral opposition of lawmakers from conservative districts -- and some of their more outspoken constituents			0
most @entity10 in the @entity9 have top rankings from the @entity115 , the powerful gun - rights lobby , which quickly criticized the @entity56 plans			1
but it 's not just @entity10 : many @entity13 , particularly in the conservative @entity140 and rural @entity141 , are vocal gun - rights supporters as well			1
" guns have been one of the key issues that more moderate @entity13 have used to express their independence from the @entity13 , and this gun talk is putting a strain on that independence , " @entity14 said			2
though they might be willing to support proposals such as a ban on large - capacity magazines , they 're unlikely to vote to ban " an actual gun , " he said			2
@entity0 / @entity156 : slight dip in support for gun control measures in last month " you can just see the ads -- ' they are taking guns away ' -- where with these other items it is different , " @entity14 said			0
even in the @entity12 , where @entity13 control the chamber , @entity13 leadership sources told @entity0 that passing any new legislation will be extremely difficult			1
more than a dozen vulnerable democrats from conservative states will likely resist much of what the president is pushing , the sources said			0
those sources say they have no intention of putting their members in politically vulnerable position on a gun measure unless they are sure it can reach the president 's desk			2
that means not only getting enough red - state democrats on board , but getting enough @entity10 to break a possible @entity10 filibuster			0
but rep. @entity185 , @entity187 - @entity186 , said the tide appears to have shifted in favor of gun control after the @entity42 killings			1
a @entity0 / @entity194 / @entity193 poll released wednesday found 55 % of @entity73 generally favor stricter gun control laws , with 56 % saying that it 's currently too easy to buy guns in this country -- but only 39 % say that stricter gun controls would reduce gun violence all by themselves			0
@entity185 said @entity12 approval " might even give some members of @entity23 the spine to do the right thing			2
" " you know , the @entity115 is not in line with an awful lot of their members , and that is something we 're counting on to go forward , " said @entity185 , whose husband was among the six killed when a deranged gunman opened fire on a @entity210 commuter train in 1993 december 's killings have " gone to the heart of every mother , father , grandparent thinking about their children , grandchildren			1
we have to do something , " she added			0
opinion : gun control -- it 's on all of us @entity0 's @entity232 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 's proposed assault weapon ban is n't likely to survive the @entity9 , *analyst* says
vulnerable @entity13 may not support legislation in the @entity12 , either
but supporters say december 's killings in @entity42 changed the equation
