-- no - one can fault @entity1 secretary of state @entity2 for lack of effort			1
he has just wrapped up his 10th visit to the @entity8 in pursuit of a peace agreement between @entity11 and the @entity12 -- the most elusive prize in international diplomacy			1
@entity2 has a vision , according to @entity1 diplomats -- to climb the mountain with @entity11 prime minister @entity18 and @entity12 president @entity19 , and to peer down from the summit on the valley of peace to see what a two - state solution would look like			1
it is a poetic metaphor , but more than half - way into the nine - month timetable for reaching a framework agreement , @entity2 's partners are still bickering in the foothills			1
the more pessimistic observers -- with history on their side -- say both the @entity11 and @entity33 are positioning themselves to be able to blame the other for failure			2
@entity2 's aim is to gather together all the issues -- " borders , security , refugees , @entity41 , mutual recognition , and the end of conflict and of all claims " -- in this framework agreement , which would in his words " lay out the end - game , " the parameters for a final peace settlement			1
@entity52 and its partners would then help the two parties hammer out the details			0
@entity2 himself has acknowledged how difficult the climb would be -- choosing another metaphor while shuttling through the region last week			2
" in the end all of these core issues fit together like a mosaic , like a puzzle and you ca n't separate out one piece or another , " he said			2
" the last pieces may decide to fall into place , or may fall on the floor , and leave the puzzle unfinished			0
" @entity2 dropped hints about progress last week , saying after meeting @entity19 that talks had " fleshed out and even resolved " certain kinds of issues			2
@entity1 envoy @entity75 will stay in the region to follow up on last week 's talks and the secretary himself will likely return within weeks			1
but at the same time , both parties are busy blaming the other for obstructing the process			0
@entity18 , with @entity2 at his side , accused the @entity12 of continuing " unabated incitement against the @entity11 " over the past six months			1
" a few days ago in @entity87 , president @entity19 embraced terrorists as heroes , " he said , referring to the welcome given to @entity12 prisoners released by @entity11			2
@entity90 and @entity92 settlements are likely to be the most difficult piece of @entity2 's puzzle			1
the @entity11 government is expected to announce plans in the next few days for building 1,400 new homes in the @entity98 , a move guaranteed to infuriate the @entity33			2
a senior @entity101 official said last week that " the settlement activity that has been going on has created a lot of questions on the @entity12 side and in the international community about the intentions of the @entity108			0
" nearly half - a - million @entity92 now live in settlements in occupied territory , and @entity11 sources maintain that the largest -- such as those in @entity113 and @entity114 -- would not be surrendered on any settlement			1
president @entity116 laid out @entity118 's principles two years ago , saying that " the @entity12 people must have the right to govern themselves , and reach their potential , in a sovereign and contiguous state			0
" that state should be based on the 1967 land boundaries -- before @entity11 seized east @entity41 and the @entity98 -- plus swaps to take account of developments since			2
@entity18 shot back that a return to such borders would imperil @entity11 's security			1
" remember that before 1967 , @entity11 was all of nine miles wide , half the width of the @entity118 beltway , " he said while meeting @entity116			0
many @entity11 officials insist that today -- in the face of growing instability in the region and a resurgence of militant @entity140 groups -- the jewish state must maintain a military presence in the @entity142 as the only way to defend the country 's eastern border , providing some strategic depth			1
and that presence , they maintain , could only be sustained by a secure road cutting through the heart of the @entity98			0
some within @entity11 's coalition government even want to annex @entity92 settlements in the fertile @entity142 , potentially the bread - basket of a new @entity12 state , and home to nearly 30 % of @entity33 living in the @entity98			1
the proposal is unlikely to go anywhere , but demonstrates the internal difficulties that face @entity18 in any push toward a final settlement			0
whatever is going on behind closed doors , @entity11 and the @entity33 seem in public no closer to compromise on other core issues			0
both continue to claim @entity41 as their capital			0
the @entity33 reject outright @entity18 's demand that they recognize @entity11 as a jewish state , fearing that to do so would disenfranchise 1.5 million @entity11 arabs			1
@entity11 foreign minister @entity166 says he has an answer for that -- move the border so that the main concentrations of @entity171 will live within a @entity12 state			2
in @entity2 's favor is a recognition among many @entity11 that the current environment may offer the best opportunity to strike a deal , with much of the @entity179 world in disarray and long - term population trends threatening to leave the @entity92 a minority in their own homeland			1
@entity166 himself said on friday that @entity2 's framework was the best @entity11 could expect and " any other proposal from the international community wo n't be as good			1
" former prime minister @entity188 chimed in , saying " there 's nothing that will change our lives so substantially , nothing that could negatively impact our lives , more than the existence or absence of a peace agreement between us and @entity33 as soon as possible			0
" and in an editorial , the @entity11 daily @entity197 said @entity18 -- and @entity11 -- could not afford to be seen as the spoiler			0
" an @entity11 refusal would put @entity11 on the @entity202 track , banishing it to the punishment corner , a disgrace to the family of nations			0
an @entity11 refusal would endanger its intimate alliance with the @entity1 , on which its national security and economic wellbeing are based			1
an @entity11 refusal would play into the @entity214 ' hands , " @entity197 wrote			0
@entity2 seemed to hint at this dilemma when he said : " the time is soon arriving where leaders are going to have to make difficult decisions			2
" through intensive diplomacy the @entity1 secretary of state is trying to build momentum and to get both @entity18 and @entity19 to make a leap of faith despite the skepticism and outright opposition they both face at home			1
by phone , in person , through his support team , @entity2 is not giving either party a moment to drift backwards			0
the self - imposed timetable calls for a framework agreement to be reached by april			0
publicly , that remains the target			0
but one senior @entity101 official says with masterly understatement : " from my 35 - year experience on this particular conflict and the efforts to resolve it , it always takes longer than you think			0

through intensive diplomacy the @entity1 secretary of state is trying to build momentum in @entity8 peace talks
