-- a recent dust - up at @entity2 is driving the latest round of " gotcha " between the right and the left			1
a host has apologized , actually tearing up as she tried to make amends for a segmet that did n't provide information , only insult			2
and yet , even as the target of the attack says it 's time to move on , the right is still incensed			1
and the left still seems uncomfortable talking about what happened			1
and it prompts me to kick off the new year with a confession : i 'm bored with both the right and the left			1
in politics , everyone lies			2
no one tells the truth			2
they all push their own agendas			2
everything is divided into these camps of blue and red , liberals and conservatives			2
the order of the day is situational ethics			0
your guy says something wrong , and you defend him because he 's your guy			1
next week , your opponent says the same exact thing , and you excoriate him because , well , he 's your opponent			1
where is the consistency ? you wo n't find much of it in the game of gotcha			2
the first rule is that you can constantly reinvent yourself			0
the second rule is that no other player can remind you of the person you were 10 minutes ago			0
the third is that , once you catch someone on the opposing team saying something intolerant or insensitive , you get to jump all over them and act high and mighty -- that is , until the next time that someone on your team says something intolerant or insensitive			0
when that happens , you get to act surprised that anyone took offense and accuse the offended of having thin skin			0
to be sure , there was plenty of offensive material in @entity66 's recent comments to @entity67 appearing to liken homosexuality to bestiality and other deviant behavior			1
as if that were n't bad enough , the star of the @entity73 's " @entity72 " also appeared to minimize the mistreatment that @entity77 - @entity76 suffered in the @entity78 before the civil rights movement			1
the left could n't wait to pounce			2
now consider what happened when @entity2 host @entity82 and her equally self - righteous guests took a break from portraying themselves as morally superior to conservatives and decided it would be hilarious to turn a baby -- specifically , an adopted @entity77 - @entity76 baby -- into a punchline			1
the three used a year - end segment dubbed " @entity93 " to poke fun at the adoption of @entity96 , who this year found himself in a family @entity99 photo , atop the lap of his new grandfather , @entity103 to some on the left , the fact that @entity96 is black , and his grandpa is n't , is a real side splitter			1
opinion : why @entity96 adoption jokes hurt upon seeing the photo , guest @entity111 was so tickled that the actress burst into song : " one of these things is not like the others ! one of these things just is n't the same			1
and that little baby , front and center , would be the one			0
" @entity122 laughed at that crack and joked that she 'd like to see @entity96 grow up to marry @entity125 , the daughter of reality star @entity127 and rapper @entity128			1
" can you imagine @entity131 and @entity128 as in - laws ? " she said			2
the other guest was not to be outdone			0
comedian @entity134 chimed in with this : " i think this picture is great			0
it really sums up the diversity of the @entity139 , the @entity140			0
at the convention , they find the one black person			0
" liberals like to think of themselves as more enlightened than anyone else			0
but if this is what passes for " enlightened " these days , i 'd hate to hear what ignorant sounds like			0
it 's pretty clear that while the focus was on the baby ( " one of these things ... " and " one black person " ) , the real target was @entity131			2
that is , this was about politics			0
it was about left and right , and that 's boring			1
what interests me now is how people treat one another , how we interact with each other during the relatively short time we have here on @entity169			1
that is what is going to endure when we 're gone , not who we voted for in a given election or our party affiliation			0
if you 're still looking for a @entity177 's resolution , how 's this one ? let 's treat each other better			1
using a baby -- let alone an adopted baby -- to score cheap political points is not how we should treat one another			1
that 's what happened here			2
once politics took over , common decency and good manners went out the window			0
@entity122 , @entity190 , and @entity134 all apologized			0
but , would n't you know it ? even that was a mixed bag			0
@entity122 did a great job			0
a day after the incident , she apologized on @entity198 " without reservation or qualification			0
" then , she opened her show saturday with more of the same and veered off into the larger issue of keeping the families of political figures off limits			1
" adults who enter into public life implicitly consent to having less privacy , " she said			0
" but their families , and especially their children , should not be treated callously or thoughtlessly			0
my intention was not malicious , but i broke the ground rule that families are off - limits , and for that i am sorry			1
" now the bad news			0
her guests were not nearly so gracious			0
in fact , their apologies were less about contrition and forgiveness , and more about politics			0
@entity190 tweeted : " in a spontaneous reaction to a photo , my disdain for @entity131 's political platform led me to inadvertently insult adoptive families			1
" in a piece for the @entity231 , @entity134 ( who has appeared on @entity0 shows and written op - eds for @entity0 ) explained that he was in hot water because " i told a joke that many on the right -- and even a few in the middle -- did n't like " and because " those on the right who monitor @entity2 were outraged " and because " right - wing media outlets " had piled on			1
he said that " being attacked by right - wing publications " is not new for him and vowed " to the self - appointed right - wing pundits " that he will " never stop calling out the wrongs and hypocrisy of the right			2
" all right , then			0
still , @entity134 wrote , " i want to sincerely apologize to the @entity96 family if anyone was offended by my joke			1
" for his part , @entity96 told @entity254 that he 's ready to move on from the controversy			1
interestingly , the three jokesters only apologized after word of the segment got out and conservative media outlets kicked up a fuss			2
you see , apparently when you have a show on @entity2 , no one watches or hears what you have to say until someone else repeats it			1
now , that 's funny			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity272 .			1

@entity272 : dust - up over @entity2 segment is latest round of " gotcha " in right - left wars
he says the *predictable* cycle of insults exacts a price in the way we treat other people
" @entity72 " star 's comments and the @entity96 adoption " jokes " should be off - limits , he says
@entity272 : in 2014 , let 's transcend mean - spirited efforts to score political points
