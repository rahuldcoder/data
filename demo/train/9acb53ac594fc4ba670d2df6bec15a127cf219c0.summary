-- after president @entity2 said he did n't yet have a strategy for @entity4 in @entity5 , even a @entity6 on sunday criticized the president 's approach to fighting the extremist terror group			1
there 's been the expected @entity12 criticism : rep. @entity13 , @entity14 , said the president 's statement was " unfortunate , " a predictable assessment from someone who disagrees with the @entity2 's handling of foreign policy			1
but more notable is sen. @entity21 , the top @entity6 on the @entity22 , who split with the leader of her party			1
" i think i 've learned one thing about this president and that is he 's very cautious			2
maybe in this instance , too cautious , " the @entity29 @entity6 said on @entity31 's " @entity30			2
" @entity21 's description comes as the @entity2 administration is implementing a split strategy in dealing with the group now calling itself the @entity37			1
in @entity39 , where @entity38 recently concluded a long war there , the @entity38 has continued airstrikes against @entity4 , including strikes near @entity44 saturday			1
in @entity5 , meanwhile , the president has been reluctant to pursue military action as a complicated web of factions , including @entity4 , is fighting to defeat president @entity49 , also a @entity38 opponent			1
the threat while members of both parties indicated that @entity5 is the most dangerous country in the world right now as it is considered @entity4 ' home base , @entity12 differed from @entity56 in that they insisted that the threat @entity4 poses to the @entity38 is immediate			1
" i believe strongly that @entity4 does plan on attacking the @entity38 , " rep. @entity59 said on " @entity60			1
" @entity2 's no ' strategy yet ' comment on @entity4 in @entity5 sparks a political uproar sen. @entity64 went even further on @entity65 ' " @entity66 " : " i think it starts with an understanding that this is a direct threat to the @entity38 , that it may be one of the biggest we have ever faced			1
" the top @entity12 ' statements come just days after @entity71 prime minister @entity70 elevated the terror threat to " severe , " the second - highest rating for that country			2
but the top @entity6 on the @entity77 , rep. @entity75 of @entity76 , played down the immediacy of a direct attack in the @entity38 on @entity0 's " @entity80 , " saying strong intelligence " at this point " of an imminent attack on the @entity38 does not exist			1
another @entity6 , rep. @entity84 of @entity85 , acknowledged the threat @entity4 poses is real , but it 's " a bit of an overstatement " to compare the threat of @entity4 to @entity90			1
" there is no evidence at this point that they are actually doing the sort of command - and - control plotting , planning specific attacks against @entity99 targets , like @entity90 was , gosh , for better -- for almost a decade before 9/11 , " he said on " @entity66			0
" ' a cancer ' @entity13 used a cancer analogy describing @entity4 , expanding upon an opinion piece written by secretary of state @entity104 in the @entity105 friday when he said " the cancer of @entity4 will not be allowed to spread to other countries			2
" " if you have cancer in your liver , and it 's spreading to other parts of your body , you do n't just treat the other parts , you treat the liver , " the @entity109 veteran said on @entity0 's " @entity110			0
" " the liver is @entity5			2
" while the president has been taking heat for saying he does n't have a strategy for @entity4 , a @entity6 on the @entity77 discussed the challenges in formulating a strategy , in part , because obtaining intelligence about @entity4 from war - torn @entity5 has been difficult			1
" we have got to get the intelligence , " @entity75 said			0
@entity84 echoed his colleague 's sentiment			0
" we ca n't simply bomb first and ask questions later			0
we have to have the right targets and the right support in order to be effective in stopping @entity4 , " he said on @entity65 ' " @entity66			2
" on friday , rep. @entity134 , @entity135 , and others sent a letter to @entity139 chairman @entity138 , asking that committee members return to @entity85 ahead of schedule in order to oversee @entity2 's response to @entity4 and the possible expansion of airstrikes			1
" we are very concerned that due to the speed with which events are happening , waiting until september 8th for @entity148 to reconvene effectively sidelines our constitutional role			0
we respectfully request that the @entity139 reconvene as early as possible to provide the needed oversight over this new development , " they wrote			1
in response , a spokesman for @entity138 said the chairman appreciates the sense of urgency and that oversight can take a variety of forms			0
" currently the chairman and other members of the committee are traveling in the @entity165 , consulting regional leaders on this important issue			0
a classified briefing for committee members -- covering @entity4 as well as the events in the @entity172 -- is scheduled for the tuesday members return , " said @entity168			0
military action now -- or soon most republicans , including @entity64 , are urging immediate airstrikes in @entity5 , the place where the terrorist group gained traction with its brutal tactics and mostly erasing the border between the @entity5 and @entity39			0
the @entity182 @entity12 joined sen. @entity183 of @entity184 , who opened the door last week to putting more @entity38 troops in @entity39			1
@entity64 said that a comprehensive strategy to defeating @entity4 " is going to require some more special forces			0
" @entity75 was among the @entity56 who urged a broad strategic plan that leaves the door open for a variety of actions , which is the message put out by the @entity2 administration over the past two days , including in @entity104 's opinion piece			1
" if we need to go ... to protect ourselves from @entity4 , we will , but it 's got to be a coalition , " @entity75 said on " @entity80			2
" democrats insisted that building an international coalition in the region and beyond is the first step			0
" we have to build that coalition , " @entity84 said			0
" we need reliable partners to work with in the region			0
" but rep. @entity203 of @entity204 , the @entity12 head of the @entity77 , said the president should have been building that coalition for the past year			2
" it 's just very , very late in the game and it presents fewer options , " @entity203 said on " @entity60			0
" @entity210 counts 3 million @entity5 refugees			0

new : rep. @entity134 and others call for the @entity139 to reconvene
sen. @entity21 says @entity2 's approach to @entity4 might be " too cautious "
@entity12 insist the threat @entity4 poses to the @entity38 is immediate
obtaining intelligence about @entity4 from war - torn @entity5 has been difficult , @entity56 say
