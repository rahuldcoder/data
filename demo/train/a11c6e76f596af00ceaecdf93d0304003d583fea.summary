-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 found himself standing apart from his @entity4 rivals on a pair of immigration issues during a @entity0 / @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , monday night			1
sounding more like a previous @entity2 governor who brought " compassionate conservatism " to the @entity11 , @entity1 staunchly defended legislation he signed that aids the children of illegal immigrants even as the audience at the debate roundly disagreed			1
the @entity2 governor was asked about a measure he approved in 2001 that grants in - state tuition rates and financial aid to the children of illegal immigrants			1
" the bottom line is it does n't make any difference what the sound of your last name is			2
that is the @entity32 way , " @entity1 said			2
" i 'm proud that we are having those individuals be contributing members of our society rather than telling them , you go be on the government dole			0
" several people in the audience of tea party activists booed @entity1 's support of that policy , which is anathema to hard - line conservatives			1
they argue it provides an incentive for immigrants to enter the country illegally			0
@entity1 said he did not favor amnesty for illegal immigrants			1
" @entity54 is not to give taxpayer subsidized benefits to people who have broken our laws or who are here in the @entity32 illegally , " said rep. @entity51 , who used the opportunity to tout her conservative credentials			0
@entity1 has overshadowed her campaign since entering the race last month @entity1 also made waves when he said the key to securing the border would be to deploy enough " boots on the ground , " which he contended the federal government had failed to do			2
several of his opponents disagreed , arguing that the correct approach to tamp down illegal immigration would be to build a border fence between the @entity32 and @entity74			2
@entity1 has called the notion -- especially in rural areas -- " preposterous " and , at the debate , asserted his authority as the candidate with the most experience dealing with border security and immigration issues			1
on both issues , the governor is out - of - step with much of the conservative wing of the @entity4			2
how much it may hurt him during the primary process is unclear			0
as the governor of a state with a large @entity91 population , @entity1 's " reasonably moderate " approach to immigration policy is simple pragmatism , said @entity95 , director of the @entity96 at the @entity97			1
" i do n't think anyone 's going to walk around and say @entity1 's pro-immigrant , but he 's been a moderate on the issue for strategic reasons , " @entity95 said			2
" he 's had to manage a different political environment than many of his opponents			0
" @entity104 make up almost 40 percent of the population in @entity2 , and @entity1 carried 38 percent of their vote in his gubernatorial contest against @entity109 @entity108 in 2010			1
in addition , business owners in the state benefit from a large immigrant labor force and cross-border commerce with @entity74 , @entity95 said			0
the in - state tuition measure was not the governor 's only gesture toward @entity104			1
last year , @entity1 opposed @entity119 's tough immigration law , @entity118 , which orders immigrants to carry registration documents at all times and requires police to question individuals who they suspect may be in the @entity32 illegally			1
but he also moved to appeal to conservatives on the contentious issue			0
earlier this year , the governor supported a bill to ban " sanctuary cities " in the state			0
the legislation would have punished cities that shielded criminal suspects from having to answer questions about their immigration status			0
though it initially received enthusiastic @entity4 support , the bill did not pass			0
as the @entity4 presidential primary race continues , some candidates may choose to focus their attacks on @entity1 's perceived softness on illegal immigration			1
@entity95 believes @entity1 is conservative enough on other key issues to weather attacks from his rivals on immigration			1
" it 's one of the areas where he does n't fit into the conservative mold , " @entity95 said			0
" [ but ] i 'd be surprised if the dynamic of this race turned around immigration			0

immigration issues separate gov. @entity1 from his rivals
he supports in - state tuition for the children of illegal immigrants
his stance drew boos from the conservative tea party debate crowd
@entity104 make up almost 40 percent of the population in @entity2
