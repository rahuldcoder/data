@entity0 -- an @entity3 man whose wife died in a car accident earlier this year is suing the hospital where she was a nurse , claiming she was " worked to death , " and that the hospital knew about it			1
@entity10 's wife , @entity9 , was killed on march 16 while driving home after a 12 - hour shift			1
the wrongful death lawsuit , filed last week , alleges that from 2011 to the time of her death , @entity15 's unit at the @entity16 in @entity17 was " regularly understaffed , " causing some nurses , including @entity21 , to work through breaks and pick up additional shifts			1
additionally , @entity10 was routinely called into work while off duty because she was one of the few nurses qualified to work the unit 's dialysis machines , according to the suit			2
" it needs to change			0
these nurses can not be treated this way , " @entity10 told @entity1 affiliate @entity32 , referring to the conditions he says led to his wife 's death			2
" they ca n't continue to work these nurses and expect them to pick up the slack because they do n't want to staff the hospitals			1
" staff shortages and overextended shifts for nurses are a nationwide issue , according to @entity47 , the nation 's largest union representing registered nurses , with nearly 185,000 members throughout the country			1
but wrongful death litigation stemming from staffing issues is unusual			1
" chronic understaffing is rampant throughout hospitals around the country , " said @entity54 , the union 's government relations director			0
" it is probably the single biggest issue facing nurses nowadays , and it 's not only affecting nurses , but patient health as well			0
" @entity10 's attorney , @entity65 , said @entity15 may have fallen asleep before her car veered off the road , jumped an embankment and struck a tree			1
during her final shift , according to the lawsuit , @entity15 told other nurses she was " really stressed " and " had n't eaten			1
" the lawsuit alleges that fatigue from being overworked contributed to the death of the 38 - year - old mother of two			1
" this is just a tragic situation , " @entity65 said tuesday			0
" the hospital clearly did not take care of its own people , and it did so deliberately			0
" @entity10 's lawsuit claims that hospital staffers , including his wife 's supervisor , were aware of the staffing problems and alerted the hospital 's parent company , @entity85			1
her supervisor expressed concern to superiors that @entity15 was being " worked to death , " yet the hospital did nothing to deal with the staffing issue , the suit said			2
@entity97 , a spokeswoman for @entity85 , expressed sympathy for the family , but declined to comment on pending litigation			0
@entity54 , the union representative , said " safe staffing ratios " of nurses to patients remain largely unregulated in the @entity101			2
@entity105 is the only state with safe staffing ratio laws , @entity54 said			0
the law requires nurses on general medical or surgical floors to care for no more than five patients at a time , and nurses in intensive care units to care for no more than two			0
the law has been in effect since 2004			0
the union has pushed for safe staffing legislation around the country			0
