this week the @entity0 heard two historic cases on marriage			1
even though i was a lawyer in the litigation and in the courthouse both days , i ca n't predict which way the court will come down			1
but the outcomes range from nothing at all to fundamentally restructuring the foundational unit of western civilization			2
@entity12 is about whether state laws defining marriage as one man and one woman violate the 14th amendment of the @entity19 @entity18			1
@entity19 v. @entity20 asks whether @entity21 of the @entity22 , which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman , is unconstitutional			1
@entity22 passed in 1996 with 78 % of the @entity26 and 85 % of the @entity27 and was signed by president @entity28			2
the whole nation is focused on the litigation			2
ironically , it 's possible that neither case will be decided on the merits			2
in @entity37 , @entity36 's governor and attorney general abdicated their duties by refusing to defend their state constitution			2
so pursuant to @entity36 law , the sponsors of @entity43 — officially registered with the state — stepped in to defend the law , represented by @entity47 at @entity48 and the @entity49			0
in @entity20 , the defendant was the federal government			0
but president @entity52 declared that he believes @entity22 is unconstitutional and ordered his @entity53 not to defend it			0
so per its rules , the @entity26 voted to authorize @entity55 — probably the greatest @entity0 lawyer practicing today — to defend @entity22			1
@entity56 of the @entity18 limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts			0
one requirement is that there must be adversity between the parties			0
since the defendants in both cases refused to defend their own laws , the court will consider whether the @entity18 allows these third - party legal teams to become a proper party to the lawsuits			1
there 's a second issue in @entity20			0
@entity20 entered into a gay marriage in @entity74 in 2007 and lived in @entity75			1
when her partner died in 2009 , @entity20 sued to contest the federal estate tax she paid , claiming a spousal exemption			0
but @entity75 did not create gay marriage until 2011 , so @entity20 was not harmed by @entity22 not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage , since if the @entity84 used state definitions @entity20 would still be regarded an a single woman			1
thus it 's possible she lacks standing to sue over the issue			0
it also raises the issue of whether courts must recognize polygamous marriages , which are legal in dozens of nations worldwide			0
the swing vote regarding the @entity56 issues in both cases is probably chief justice @entity98			1
he openly expressed skepticism in @entity37 and led the @entity0 in an hour - long debate in @entity20 solely focused on whether the court has jurisdiction			1
assuming the court does decide the merits , the implications are historic			2
@entity20 would alter @entity19 's system of federalism			0
only the states determine who can get married			0
but the federal government is free to decide whom to confer federal benefits on — largely economic entitlements and federal issues such as immigration			2
federalism is a two - way street			0
but if @entity119 is invalidated , the states will be able to dictate whom the recipients of federal benefits are			0
if @entity20 is historic , @entity122 is earth - shattering			0
if the @entity0 declares a constitutional right to marriage other than one - man , one - woman , then all traditional marriage laws in all 50 states will be invalid , and there will be a serious debate ( already in a lower federal court ) of whether polygamists also have a constitutional right to national recognition			1
on the merits , the court seems unlikely to declare an unwritten constitutional right to gay marriage , though arguments did not go as well for @entity22			1
justice @entity141 is likely the swing vote in both			0
as justice @entity145 said this week , the @entity144 and cell phones have been around on this planet longer than gay marriage			1
it is an energetic debate in all 50 states , and this summer we will learn whether the @entity0 will shut down this debate by making it a constitutional issue on which the @entity19 people are not allowed to vote .			1

@entity154 : cases heard by @entity0 could result in *momentous* change
he says there are *questions* of whether cases could be *tossed* because of *special* *circumstances*
if court issues sweeping ruling , it could *deprive* voters of *chance* to weigh in
@entity154 : gay marriage is such a new *phenomenon* that court should n't freeze the debate
