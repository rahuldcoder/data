a 30 - day rape sentence given to a teacher who admitted to raping his 14 - year - old student may be illegal , according to the @entity4 judge who imposed it			1
the judge scheduled a new hearing for friday			1
" the defendant shall be present at argument as the @entity11 , if necessary and appropriate , will amend the mandatory minimum portion of the sentence , " read a court order filed tuesday			1
it appears the mandatory minimum is two years , not 30 days , the order said			1
" in this court 's opinion , imposing a sentence which suspends more than the mandatory minimum would be an illegal sentence , " it continued			1
the case drew widespread attention when district judge @entity23 imposed the 30 - day sentence on @entity25 and made controversial comments about the victim , saying she " seemed older than her chronological age			1
" @entity30 , a prosecutor with the @entity33 attorney 's office , did not immediately return a call for comment			2
in a memo from his office to the @entity4 attorney general 's office , attorneys had argued the relevant statute was " misapplied and the minimum sentence that could be imposed in @entity25 's case was two years " -- anticipating the judge 's tuesday order			1
