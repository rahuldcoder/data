@entity0 -- people ask me why a doctor would dress like a homeless person and make house calls under bridges			1
i say enthusiastically , " why not ! ? " that 's just what i did in 1992 in an effort to take my medical teaching career beyond the walls of the hospital			1
dressing like a homeless person seemed the best way to initially enter the street community , which i sincerely wanted to do			1
i had come to a point where i needed a new " classroom " in which medical students could fully experience the reality of those who did not make it into effective medical care			1
we needed to understand how health care is shaped by the real life experiences of those who struggle with difficult circumstances			1
if there were any people who could teach us those lessons , i believed it would be the people who were living under the bridges of @entity0			1
initially , i did n't tell the hospital ( or my malpractice carrier ) what i was doing			0
my guide was a formerly homeless expert , @entity38			2
together , we made house calls under the bridges , along the riverbanks and in the abandoned buildings of @entity0			1
a whole new world opened to me			2
the depth of medical need i saw was exceeded only by the hopelessness of the people i came to know			2
each person became inconveniently real to me , and going home to my warm bed became increasingly difficult			2
but what i also discovered was the profound satisfaction of bringing care directly to those who would otherwise have none			2
i was becoming part of the street world			1
another reality in the homeless camps and in the alleys , i found people who had suffered extremes of weather , violence and prejudice			2
many were older , confused people ; some were war veterans holding on to the last shreds of their dignity ; others were simply people who had fallen on hard times and lost hope			0
i saw hideous leg ulcers and cancers that were untreated			0
but mostly i saw human beings who had minimal access to loving , effective services			0
the street homeless live in another reality			1
it is often brutal and short			0
health issues are secondary to immediate survival , but according to the @entity85 , the average life expectancy among that population is estimated between 42 and 52 years , compared with 78 years in the general population			1
this essentially makes street homelessness one of the most fatal conditions in the @entity90			2
as i watched more and more people die out there , these numbers became a very real experience			0
looking in from the streets , i saw my community as a largely hostile , unforgiving place			0
the reaction of the non-homeless to those sleeping on the streets is often negative			0
i know this is born from frustration , but i believe that as long as ignorance and fear dictate how we perceive others , we have little hope of building effective , inclusive solutions			0
we must get close enough to know each other			0
i am also convinced that by " going to the people , " health care can learn to engage people on their terms , holistically building health solutions grounded in their reality			0
this will potentially make health care delivery more cost effective and efficient as the principles of " street medicine " are applied to other populations			1
how much we can learn from those who are left out ! a model for @entity124 as word of our work spread beyond the streets , other volunteers and students joined the effort			0
@entity131 was officially founded under the @entity132 in 1993			0
according to the group 's records , as of 2014 , more than 10,000 homeless individuals have been reached with more than 68,000 visits to the street homeless of @entity0			1
more than 900 chronically homeless persons have achieved housing directly through @entity131 efforts			0
significantly , for the first time , the medical care of the street homeless is coordinated within the entire city			1
students from all over the world now come to @entity0 to work with @entity131 , many starting street medicine programs of their own in cities such as @entity150 , @entity151 ; @entity152 ; @entity153 , @entity154 ; @entity155 ; and @entity156 , @entity157			1
in 2005 , after extensive global networking , the first @entity158 was held in @entity0			2
each year , a different city hosts the meeting , which is the only forum for pioneers of the street medicine movement to meet and develop this new field of medicine			0
at the 2013 meeting in @entity169 , 200 enthusiastic professionals and students gathered from five continents			0
in 2009 , the @entity171 was established with two visions : every person in the world who remains on the streets will have direct access to health care , and every medical school will have a " classroom " in its own streets			1
the @entity171 provides consulting services to assist communities that seek to establish new street medicine programs and improve the care of their own street homeless populations			1
under the umbrella of the @entity171 , there are now more than 40 street medicine programs in the @entity90 and more than 90 programs worldwide			1
increasingly , we are finding that by first addressing the immediate medical needs of those on the streets , pathways to housing , financial stability and recovery are being realized			0
we believe that by taking care of our own fallen citizens , but by doing it within a global vision , we reclaim the true spirit of health care and build better communities for ourselves			0
