-- if you think all conservatives support a deportation - only approach to immigration , think again			2
last week , hundreds of conservative evangelicals gathered in @entity7 to engage in a reasonable , respectful discourse on immigration			1
less than a year after @entity7 enacted the strictest immigration law in the land , evangelical students , pastors and national faith leaders gathered at @entity15 in @entity16 for " a @entity18 - centered conversation on immigration " called the @entity19			1
following the example of @entity23 's inaugural @entity19 gathering last fall in @entity24 , evangelical @entity20 gathered in @entity16 to discuss immigration through the prism of the @entity26			1
instead of listening to partisan sound bites , participants looked to the word of @entity30 -- specifically the 92 references to " ger , " the word for " stranger , " in the @entity32 alone			0
calls for humanity and compassion came from national and local evangelicals who recognize the law 's devastating effects			0
dr. @entity42 , president of the @entity43 , said , " as @entity20 , we have a responsibility to obey the rule of law , not to enforce the law			2
and , as citizens of heaven , we also have a responsibility to feed those who are hungry without asking them for [ their ] immigration status			1
policymakers ' misguided race to the bottom on immigration has also affected faith leaders ' ability to minister to all of @entity30 's children , regardless of immigration status			1
and , the economic impact to the state has been dramatic			0
the @entity7 law , @entity65 , resulted in some crops rotting on the vine and police arresting a visiting executive of a multinational car manufacturer with a new plant in the state			0
now , economists forecast that the law will cost the @entity7 economy billions of dollars			0
closing the event , dr. @entity76 , of the @entity77 in @entity16 , reflected on the nation 's ongoing struggle for civil rights : " @entity82 is a land of opportunity			1
and , if done correctly , it can be a land of opportunity for all of @entity30 's children			0
" a fundamental shift is occurring among conservatives toward a new consensus on immigrants and @entity82			1
these are the early steps in a march by @entity82 of all political stripes fed up with partisan attacks on immigrants and immigration -- a groundswell ready and willing to skewer political extremism from either side of the aisle			1
the conference in @entity7 was a quest for spiritual guidance to forge a path forward on immigration reform			2
contrast that with a meeting of another group of conservatives , about 1,500 miles to the west			0
ahead of this week 's primaries in @entity111 and @entity112 , the four @entity114 candidates for president " debated " immigration by choosing the same path : political expedience and division over practical , humane immigration solutions			1
in @entity126 , @entity111 , around the birthplace of that state 's own anti-immigrant law , @entity125 , the candidates were quick to endorse the family - separating tactics of sheriff @entity129 and call for the building of ( double ) walls at our borders			0
the candidates ' only hint of compassion was @entity138 's suggestion that he would not require individual homeowners to verify the legal status of their domestic help			2
in other words , undocumented immigrants can care for our children , do our laundry and mow our lawns , but we will do nothing to keep their families together or provide a way for them to emerge from the shadows			0
ignoring the economic and social value of immigrants and immigration to our nation , the @entity114 candidates ' strategy is to tap into the fear and unease of our constantly changing society			0
rather than work toward a political consensus on immigrants and @entity82 , they would rather implement unjust immigration laws that separate families , cost tens of billions of dollars every year and undermine @entity82 workers by pushing immigrants further underground			1
the @entity114 candidates for president are stuck in reverse			0
instead of treating immigration like other important conservative issues and actively seeking to change the law , they trumpet fantasies such as self - deportation and fail to lead @entity82 forward			1
their race to the margins runs the risk of pushing conservative @entity82 away			2
they 're missing an opportunity , as the events in @entity24 and @entity7 make clear			0
@entity82 want reasonable , humane solutions for our nation 's immigration system			1
it is time the @entity114 offered them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

evangelical students , pastors , faith leaders gathered for conference on immigration
@entity193 says discourse was reasonable and respectful
leaders saw responsibility to feed the hungry without regard to immigration status , he says
@entity193 : @entity82 want reasonable , humane solutions to immigration *problems*
