-- these days , stories about airline crew - member meltdowns and traffic controllers asleep on the job are enough to make even the bravest fliers clutch their armrests a little tighter			1
but despite these unusual incidents , the @entity8 airline industry is enjoying one of the safest periods in its history			1
" it 's really pretty amazing -- not just the year - to - year safety record -- but when you consider that air travel involves doing some fairly risky things , like flying an aircraft in bad weather and all kinds of conditions , " says @entity15 of the @entity16 , a nonprofit group focusing on safety research and advocacy			1
although regional airline crashes in 2009 , 2006 , 2004 and 2003 killed 133 people , the most recent deadly @entity8 crash of a large airliner was in 2001 , when @entity30 went down in @entity31 , @entity32 , killing 265			1
in the 1990s there were at least five fatal mid-size or wide - body domestic airline crashes , and in the ' 80s there were at least three			1
" we 've seen a dramatic improvement since the 1990s , " says @entity15			0
" everybody uses different stats , but you used to have probably between one and two accidents per million departures			0
last year we were down to well below one accident per million departures			0
" it 's not overstating it to say the nation has entered an unprecedented era of safer skies , according to industry experts including a former @entity52 official			1
a combination of improvements introduced and implemented in the ' 80s and ' 90s gets credit -- including innovations in pilot training , better sharing of safety solutions , and technological advances			1
an electronic on - board system called @entity64 , which is aimed at preventing midair collisions , has probably saved countless lives			0
so has something called ground proximity warning systems , which alert pilots if they 're in danger of crashing into the ground when weather makes visibility difficult			0
also developed in the past decades : cockpit resource management -- a fancy term for procedures first developed in the 1980s to help flight crews behave and communicate better to avoid circumstances that could have deadly consequences			1
in last month 's @entity82 incident during a flight between @entity32 and @entity84 , capt. @entity80 began acting erratically , prompting the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit			1
" i do n't know if 15 years ago whether a co-pilot would have had the guts to trick that captain into getting out of the cockpit , " says @entity87 , former managing director of the @entity52			0
" that all comes from @entity93 -- which is saying that everybody 's got a responsibility for safety			1
" " what was a very hierarchical authority - based crew structure back in the early 1980s has been completely overhauled , " says @entity15			2
" you have a whole new generation of crews that do n't even think the same way anymore			0
they work as a team together , not just in the cockpit , but with the cabin crew			2
" @entity107 travelers have benefited from vastly improved satellite and weather prediction technology			2
pilots and controllers have much more precise data allowing them to more accurately fly around dangerous storms			0
but weather data systems are n't infallible			0
@entity116 , from @entity117 to @entity118 , which crashed into the @entity119 in 2009 killing 228 , paid a price , says @entity87 , because it flew through a storm , while other aircraft avoided it			0
heavy news media coverage of terrible crashes in the ' 90s , like @entity134 near @entity135 and @entity136 off @entity137 , " allowed safety to really go to the top of the agenda in the aviation discussion , " says @entity87 , giving the @entity52 more influence to push @entity125 and the airlines toward more safety improvements			1
" safety is a nonevent which gives you the impression that it does n't require active effort , " says @entity15 , a former @entity138 official and air traffic controller			2
" about 731 million @entity8 passengers flew in 2011 , according to the @entity138			1
the yearly projection for 2032 is 1.2 billion			0
for that reason alone , there are serious questions about whether the industry can maintain its safety record			1
the biggest threat , says @entity15 , would be aggressive budget cutbacks , either on @entity155 or in corporate boardrooms			0
" will we have enough money for the infrastructure ? will we have the appropriate number of regulators available to support the growth that we are going to have and keep the brilliant safety record that we have ? " the @entity138 's plan to improve air traffic efficiency and communication , called @entity167 , is the key to safely managing the anticipated surge in passengers , says @entity87			2
in 2009 , a regional air carrier -- @entity172 -- crashed near @entity173 , @entity32 , killing 50 people			1
that tragedy offered the industry a warning about how a shifting economy can affect airline safety , says @entity15			1
" it was a product of a burst of growth , " he says			0
" @entity183 started running out of people to fill seats in the cockpit and in certain circumstances you may see cases where someone is not as qualified or trained or as experienced as you might like being pushed into the ( pilot 's ) seat			2
" @entity193 concluded the crash of the @entity195 was caused by the crew 's " loss of situational awareness and failure to follow @entity107 training and procedures			1
" the @entity138 has proposed more stringent qualifications for pilots in the wake of that accident			0
@entity15 sees " a very strong correlation between extreme growth pressure and accidents			0
" as examples he cites air crash upticks in the past decade in @entity211 and @entity212			2
" all of them were preceded by a sudden boom in the industry , " says @entity15			2
" we got a little taste of that with @entity193 -- and now the system has settled back down and hopefully we 've taken some lessons away from that			0
