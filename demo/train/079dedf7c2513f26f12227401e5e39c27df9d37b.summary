-- @entity1 is in siege mode			1
the manager of soccer club @entity4 has been so stung by widespread criticism of his actions this week that he claims the sole person not to have commented is @entity8 -- and that 's only because he 's busy trying to stop the @entity11 economy falling over a fiscal cliff			1
@entity1 , who recently gave a talk on his management techniques at @entity15 , has been under fire following a verbal exchange with referee @entity18 and his assistants during wednesday 's controversial 4 - 3 win over @entity21			1
it led to @entity21 manager @entity23 claiming that @entity1 should have been punished for his protests over @entity18 's failure to disallow @entity27 ' own - goal for what he believed to be offside			1
the @entity29 was furious that @entity18 overruled his assistant , @entity30 , who had flagged to give @entity31 offside before @entity27 diverted the ball into his own net			1
@entity36 controversy : has @entity1 gone too far ? @entity1 , who turns 71 on december 31 , will escape punishment from the @entity38 because the incident was not mentioned in the referee 's report , much to @entity23 's astonishment			1
it was the second match in four days where @entity1 has courted controversy , having claimed that his striker @entity36 " could have been killed " after @entity47 's @entity46 kicked a ball at his head in sunday 's 1 - 1 draw			1
and the @entity4 manager has defended his conduct , stating that everybody is suddenly keen to have an opinion -- apart from the man inside the @entity56			1
" the problem for me and @entity4 is that the profile of the club is huge , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" @entity23 has come out and criticized me			1
@entity23 is the worst at haranguing referees -- his whole staff ( do it ) every game			1
he was at it for the whole game on wednesday			2
" he shoves the linesman and laughs about it and he has to cheek to criticize me			2
he forgets the help i gave him , by the way			2
" the press have a good field day			2
they have addressed every possible angle , the only one they have not asked is @entity8 -- he is too busy			2
" it 's unfortunate that i carry that , because i 'm the manager of the biggest club in the world			1
i 'm not like @entity21 -- a wee club in the @entity82			1
" that is the facts of life			0
i was demonstrative but i was not out of order			0
that has been overplayed by the press			0
you 've all had a field day			0
" @entity92 winner lifts @entity4 @entity1 was reacting after @entity23 had given his views on the incident at @entity95			1
@entity23 told reporters : " i think @entity18 might feel slightly disappointed he did n't do something about it			2
" i think the pressure that was on him was tough for a referee to take			0
sometimes when you reflect on a game you think you might have acted differently			0
you do that as a manager and i think he might have done that as a referee			2
" but it 's an emotional game and apparently they had a cordial discussion			0
i 've had a few of those myself and sometimes i 've ended up in the stands as a result of that cordial discussion			0
" @entity1 seemed particularly irked by the comments , and referred to @entity23 's own altercation with a referee during a @entity117 match in august			1
@entity118 ' could have been killed ' @entity23 was fined $ 32,000 and given a two - match touchline ban after pushing an assistant referee during his side 's 2 - 1 home win over @entity123			1
" some managers shove linesman on the pitch and make a joke of it			0
i 'm not making a joke of this			0
i think it should have been disallowed , i really do , " @entity1 said			2
" there was no ranting and raving from me			0
i was demonstrative but then i am always demonstrative -- everyone knows that			0
i 'm an emotional guy			0
" what happened was that @entity18 was walking towards the center circle and i came up to the touchline and he came towards me and i went towards him			0
i was not on the pitch for more than three or four yards			0
then we came off together			0

@entity1 defends himself after fierce criticism from @entity21 manager @entity23
@entity4 manager says only person not to have a view on saga is @entity11 *president*
the @entity29 hits out at @entity23 and calls @entity21 a " wee club in the @entity82 "
@entity1 will not face any punishment for his behavior during 4 - 3 win over @entity21
