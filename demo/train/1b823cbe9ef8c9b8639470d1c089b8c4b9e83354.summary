-- when i was a small child , i spent many afternoons on my father 's lap seeing qat being chewed in front of my eyes			1
in fact , i used to innocently help my father and hand him the greenish leaves from the plastic bag that was seated right next to us			0
my father , like almost all men in @entity16 , would spend every afternoon , every day of the week and every month of the whole year chewing qat starting from afternoon until late at night			1
now i 'm joining a campaign against this leafy narcotic because of the devastating effect it has on my country			0
aside from the effect that the drug has on individuals , production of qat is using up almost a third of groundwater in a country that suffers chronic water shortages			1
we are calling for a " @entity33 " on april 12 , asking the government to completely ban qat from its offices			1
there are several reasons that my father -- and more than 90 % of @entity16 men -- chew qat for many hours a day			1
chief among these is the excitement they obtain from it and the relaxing and sociable atmosphere it generates			0
little did i know as a child the catastrophic effect it has on life in @entity16			2
chewing qat is a major cultural phenomenon in @entity16 and many @entity55 countries			1
it used to be socially unacceptable for women to chew qat but nowadays a great number of women chew qat			1
today , almost 90 % of my female relatives chew qat			1
i myself have tried it once			0
@entity66 is an integral part of @entity16 's society because of two factors			1
the first factor is that during qat sessions contacts are made , business deals are sealed and social and even governmental decisions are made			0
the second factor is qat induces a state of euphoria and elation with feelings of increased alertness and arousal			0
it contains cathinone , a natural amphetamine that in the @entity85 is a @entity86 one drug , alongside heroin and cocaine			0
in 1980 , the @entity89 classified qat as a drug of abuse that can generate light to moderate psychological dependence and not necessarily addictiveness			0
more alarming , qat farmers usually sprinkle pesticide residues on it , which causes cancers , liver cirrhosis and kidney disease			0
this destructive leaf is not only lethal for qat chewers but also for @entity16 as a state			1
" cultivated areas of qat have increased from less than 10,000 hectares in the early 1970s to 146,810 in 2008 , " said dr @entity105 , former minister of agriculture and fisheries , in a study paper quoted in the @entity108 in january 2012			0
" the gravity of the situation lies in the depletion of groundwater with qat eating up almost 30 % of the natural reserves			2
qat production generated in 2008 approximately 246 billion @entity118 ( $ 1.1billion ) , while fruits and vegetables brought in 276 billion @entity118 ( $ 1.3billion ) and grains 91 billion ( $ 422million ) , " he continued			2
@entity66 is consuming a huge percentage of @entity16 's water , when many experts predict that @entity16 will be the first country in the world to run out of water in the near future			1
@entity66 embodies a great threat to @entity16 's development socially , economically and environmentally			1
there have been numerous campaigns to fight qat and the most recent one was created by @entity135 , a @entity16 political analyst in social media living in @entity138			2
" this campaign is an expansion for the first campaign ( no @entity142 ) that occurred on january 12			2
the current campaign calls for the government to ban qat from governmental facilities , " she explains			1
" meaning , to ban employees from chewing qat at those institutions because it 's a troubling side of @entity16			1
" there is a collective neglect in @entity16 to this issue when it 's threatening			2
employees at governmental facilities , teachers in school , lecturers at colleges chew qat publicly and that 's awful			1
" at least we must start with those educated working people to eliminate the consumption of qat , which will assist tackling the water shortage , " she adds			0
also on inside the @entity170 : abused animals in @entity138 face losing safe haven in 1972 , @entity16 's former prime minister @entity173 designed a plan to fight qat with the assistance of religious figures , saying that @entity66 was sinful			1
after that , there was no concrete effort from the government to fight qat			2
however , today there is a hope with the grass - root efforts			0
@entity187 has tens of organizers from local civil - society organizations throughout the country that will run sessions on this issue and distribute posters to people and government employees			0
she also has endorsement from very influential figures , like @entity200 laureate @entity199 ; prominent researcher and writer dr @entity202 ; former @entity16 representative to the @entity205 @entity204 , and others			0
@entity187 believes the campaign will be a success			0
moreover , most of @entity16 's media outlets will cover the campaign after @entity212 , the minister of information officially ordered them to do so , and schools throughout the country will run activities to raise awareness about qat 's danger after dr. @entity221 , minister of education officially ordered them to do so			1
on top of all that , @entity224 , a @entity16 lawyer , designed a draft for a law to be legislated at the parliament			0
the draft suggests passing a law that bans chewing qat from governmental facilities			0
@entity16 kicked out former president @entity233 from power but will they kick out qat as well ? we shall wait and see			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			0

more than 90 % of @entity16 men chew qat , says @entity16 *journalist* @entity239
production uses almost a third of @entity16 's groundwater , she says
no @entity142 on april 12 asks government offices to ban qat for one day
