the @entity1 news keeps pouring in			2
two nurses who treated the first person diagnosed with @entity1 in the @entity4 are in isolation			1
a nursing assistant in @entity7 who contracted the disease has been declared free of the virus			1
health officials have cleared many of the people who came in contact with @entity15 patient @entity14 after monitoring their temperatures for 21 days			1
as these facts and more are revealed , here 's what you need to know about the deadly virus and what 's being done to stop its spread : what are the symptoms of @entity1 ? symptoms include fever , severe headache , muscle pain , weakness , diarrhea , vomiting , internal bleeding and stomach pain			1
the @entity34 says the average time it takes for symptoms to appear after infection is eight to 10 days			2
with all these cases in the @entity4 , should i be worried ? @entity1 is difficult to catch			2
you would only be at risk if you came into close contact with the blood , saliva , sweat , feces , semen , vomit or soiled clothing of an @entity1 patient , or if you had traveled to the impacted areas in @entity52 and came into contact with someone who had @entity1			2
for example , as of midnight sunday , 43 of the 48 people who had contact with @entity14 while he was symptomatic were cleared by health officials ; they no longer have to endure twice - daily temperature checks after reaching the 21 - day incubation mark			1
officials said the others on the list will be cleared shortly if no symptoms appear			1
why 21 days ? the @entity34 says it can take up to 21 days for symptoms of @entity1 to appear , so someone can be infected with the virus and not yet know that he or she is sick			1
health officials monitor potential patients for that long before declaring them safe			1
a blood test can only be positive for @entity1 once symptoms appear			2
there is some controversy over this number			2
@entity77 , who published a study last week on the topic , looked at past outbreaks and found there was a 12 % chance of people becoming symptomatic after the official 21 - day period			2
" i think ( the incubation period ) probably should be longer , " @entity77 told @entity85			2
" there needs to be more of a dialogue between the scientific and medical community and the policymakers on deciding what that appropriate level should be			2
" so what is the 42 - day period i keep hearing about ? the @entity95 declares countries free of @entity1 transmission after 42 days			1
when a country believes it has an outbreak under control , it must show there are no new cases during that 42 - day period			0
basically , @entity95 doubles the 21 - day incubation period of the virus to ensure no new infections are happening			1
have any countries in @entity52 stopped the ebola virus ? yes			1
who has declared both @entity110 , which had one case , and @entity112 , 19 confirmed cases and one probable , free of ebola virus transmission			1
unfortunately , the number of cases in @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 is still growing			0
the current outbreak is considered the largest in world history -- with more than 9,100 cases and 4,500 deaths due to @entity1			0
are @entity4 airports screening for @entity1 patients ? out of an abundance of caution , five of @entity4 's biggest and busiest airports are going to do special screenings -- including taking the temperature of anyone who has come from an @entity1 - affected country -- to keep the disease from spreading further in the @entity4			1
the @entity34 is going to monitor travelers for any sign of illness and will ask a series of questions about their exposure to @entity1 patients			0
travelers with symptoms will be isolated and those who are symptom - free will get information about how to watch for possible signs of the virus			1
authorities at the @entity150 's @entity148 and @entity149 airports , as well as @entity152 railway terminals , also will begin screening passengers arriving from @entity1 - affected @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity117			1
how did this outbreak start ? it probably started with a 2 - year old patient in a village in @entity117			0
the toddler died december 6 , 2013 , according to a report published in @entity160			0
scientists do n't know how the toddler got it , but the virus can spread from animals to humans through infected bodily fluids			1
it has been spread through infected chimps , gorillas , monkeys , fruit bats , porcupines and forest antelope , according to @entity95			0
is that why @entity7 officials euthanized an @entity1 patient 's dog ? health officials in @entity180 were concerned that the dog , @entity182 , might carry the virus because its owner -- a nurse 's aide who treated an @entity1 patient in @entity7 -- was diagnosed with the disease			1
despite a " @entity182 " petition campaign , which was signed by about 400,000 people , the dog was put to sleep			0
yet in @entity195 , @entity193 's @entity192 , @entity194 , was simply put in quarantine , so there are alternatives to euthanization			1
should i worry about my own dog ? studies on a dog - to - human transmission of the virus are not conclusive			1
in the 2001 - 2002 outbreak in @entity207 , scientists found signs of the virus in 25 % of the dogs living near the outbreak			1
the animals were not symptomatic , nor did they die during the time the scientists were studying them			0
" the only conclusion that may be safely drawn from this study is that the animals encountered ebola virus ( and their immune systems responded ) , " @entity214 , a clinical veterinarian and assistant professor of medicine at @entity217 , wrote in an email to @entity85			1
" whether or not dogs shed @entity1 once their immune systems encounter it remains to be seen			0
" " asymptomatically infected dogs could be a potential source of human @entity1 outbreaks , " scientists who studied the 2001 outbreak wrote			0
the @entity34 is working with the @entity229 and the @entity4 @entity230 to develop guidance for the @entity4 pet population , but the @entity34 says the likelihood that @entity4 pets will pass @entity1 on to @entity4 is slim			0
what if i have a cat ? the ebola virus has been found in other animals , but to date there have been no documented infections in cats			2
is there a cure ? not yet , but scientists are scrambling to find one			0
a drug called @entity248 was given to two @entity4 who contracted the disease in @entity118 and were brought to @entity250 in @entity251 for treatment in august			0
they recovered fully , and the medication seemed to play a role in that recovery , but there are no more doses of that drug			0
the @entity4 @entity259 has provided funding to @entity261 so it can conduct more early - stage clinical trials on the drug right now			0
a drug called @entity1 was used on another @entity4 patient who was treated in @entity266 , dr. @entity265			2
that drug , manufactured by @entity268 , showed some promise , and the @entity270 gave it a fast - track designation to speed up the testing process			0
the biopharmaceutical company @entity273 got approval for the emergency use of its drug , @entity277 , for @entity14 in @entity15			1
he did not get the experimental medicine immediately			0
the @entity280 also started human testing on a vaccine in september , and another vaccine developed by the @entity284 -- licensed to @entity286 - based @entity285 -- is about to start clinical trials			0
complete @entity1 coverage how many more people will get sick ? the @entity34 predicts as many as 550,000 to 1.4 million people could be infected with @entity1 by january			0
that calculation was based on figures from september , before the @entity4 sent additional help to @entity52			0
the @entity34 estimates that if 70 % of the people with @entity1 are cared for properly , the epidemic could decrease and eventually end .			0
