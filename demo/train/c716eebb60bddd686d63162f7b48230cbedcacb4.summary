-- in 2008 , president @entity1 campaigned on a message of " @entity3			1
" thursday , speaking in @entity4 , the president announced his re-election campaign message of " @entity7			1
" the president had to give another economic speech , nearly an hour long , because he has not given us economic results			1
@entity12 does not need excuses ; we need leadership			1
the president 's speech was a speech of excuses , basically blaming president @entity17 and tax cuts for all that ails the @entity12 economy			1
the president announced his intention to run against @entity17 , but he is a little late -- he missed that election by eight years			2
by the way , even that is not a campaign he can win ; i recommend that he should try to run against @entity29 instead			2
president @entity1 can not ask @entity12 if they are better off than they were four years ago , and so is trying to blame others for his record			1
over half a million fewer @entity12 have jobs today than when he took office			0
after his advisers projected that his $ 800 billion stimulus bill would keep unemployment below 8 % , it has remained above that benchmark for a record 40 months and counting			0
median family net worth has hit a two - decade low , median household income has declined , more than 30 % of borrowers are underwater on their mortgage , 23 million @entity12 remain unemployed or underemployed , and half of college graduates this year come out of school unemployed or underemployed			0
being president is a hard job			2
one of the hardest parts is that you ca n't just make excuses			2
it 's just not allowed from the president of the @entity12			2
excuses make the president look small and weak			1
it is frankly a little embarrassing			0
read @entity59 's view : @entity60 would let middle class pay tab for the rich the president himself promised , after being elected , that if he did n't get the economy fixed in three years , then his presidency was " going to be a one - term proposition			1
" president @entity70 , speaking in 2010 at the same spot where the president spoke thursday , said " give us two more years			2
if it does n't work , vote us out			0
now , the president is basically saying that he is a victim of circumstances , and we are all victims			2
thursday 's speech was also a speech of class warfare			1
the other campaign president @entity1 announced is a class warfare campaign of division			1
he plans to divide @entity12 along class lines , gender lines , party lines , age lines and any other lines he can find			1
he will run a campaign of rich against poor , men against women , @entity90 against @entity91 , young against old and liberals against conservatives			2
but @entity12 is fundamentally a young country at heart , and we know our best days are always ahead			0
we are an aspirational people who want our children to inherit more opportunity than we inherited from our parents			0
we know that our circumstances of birth , race , gender and zip code do not determine our outcomes as adults			0
we know we are promised equality of opportunity , not equality of outcomes			2
we are not an envious people who vilify success			0
we believe in an @entity12 where any child can succeed and pursue the @entity12 dream through hard work and a great education			0
we are not looking for a president who wants to make us more like @entity118 , manage the slow decline of a great nation , and redistribute the wealth			0
the president is completely correct when he says this election is a crucial choice between two paths			1
we must choose between the government path and the private sector @entity128			1
we must choose between the @entity118 path and the @entity12 path			0
the president promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term , and instead has amassed trillion dollar deficits every year he has been in office			1
at 24 % of @entity139 , federal government spending now exceeds @entity141 norms , as the federal government grows in size and involvement in our daily lives			0
president @entity1 has gotten the federal government involved in bailouts , crony capitalism and running car companies , banks and health care ; one can only imagine what would happen in a second term			1
yet , amazingly , president @entity1 on thursday doubled down on his failed policy of borrowing money from @entity156 to grow government spending , instead of growing the private sector			1
his entire philosophy can be encapsulated in one little line toward the end of his speech			0
he suggested we should put money into infrastructure and " do some nation building here at home			0
" while this may be a cute turn of phrase , and certainly polls well , it is all you need to know about the outlook of this president			0
he believes that this nation was built by the government , and that more government spending is the key to our future			0
this is a speech that should have been delivered in @entity183			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			1

@entity186 : president @entity1 failed to deliver what he promised on the economy
he says the president is *signalling* that his campaign will be one of " divide and blame "
@entity1 makes excuses for failing on economy , *promotes* class warfare , @entity186 says
@entity186 : choice is between trying to *rebuild* economy through government or the private sector
