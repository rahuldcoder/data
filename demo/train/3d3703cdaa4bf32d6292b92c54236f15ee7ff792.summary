-- in the last few years , awareness about bullying has increased dramatically			2
some adults may still think bullying is just a youthful rite of passage , but it seems worse than in previous generations for many parents , educators and kids			1
it does n't stop at the schoolyard or even a child 's front door			2
access to the @entity17 and social media websites mean kids can be bullied and tormented around the clock , even in the supposed safety of their own homes			2
the cruelty that can come with the strike of a button on a keyboard can hurt just as much as any punch or push in a playground			0
we 've produced a documentary called " @entity30 " which follows the stories of a number of people filmmaker @entity34 introduced audiences to in his remarkable 2012 film " bully			1
" these are kids and parents who have taken their pain , their suffering , their grief and turned it into action			0
our unhealthy love of reality tv bullying i first started reporting on the problem of bullying a few years ago when a rash of suicides of children propelled the issue into the national spotlight			1
since then , i 've interviewed far too many parents whose children took their own lives because they felt like it was the only way out of the pain			2
it 's not just tragic , it 's unacceptable			1
through our reporting , we 've repeatedly tried to understand the complex issues surrounding bullying			1
there are not just bullies and victims			0
sometimes a child who is bullied may bully someone else			0
we 've tried to understand how bullying can be a form of what researchers call " social combat , " and we 've looked at what programs work to prevent it , and why some schools fail to adequately address the problem			0
most bullying incidents are witnessed by bystanders : other students , teachers , and adults			0
all too often those bystanders fail to intervene , fail to stand up and say " enough is enough			0
" as a teenager i saw other kids being bullied			0
sometimes i tried to stop it , often times , i remained silent			0
it still pains me to this day			0
share your story about child bullying with @entity90 increasing empathy and understanding is one of the greatest weapons we have to reduce bullying			1
that 's why i believe in the power of reporting			1
and why i hope you will watch " @entity30 " on @entity0 tonight at 8 p.m. @entity99 is happening , and you can be part of it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity103			1
