@entity0 -- when the @entity6 torch lights up in @entity7 on friday , hundreds of millions of tv screens , laptops and mobile phones will likewise be turned on in @entity8			1
@entity10 sports fans are expected to watch the world 's best athletes compete for medals and fame at the @entity15			1
hardly any @entity10 expect @entity7 to be able to match the spectacular opening ceremony that @entity0 choreographed four years ago			1
@entity7 set for @entity6 opener " they will get the job done but it definitely wo n't be as good as @entity8 did , " said @entity18 , who works for @entity19 , the national television network			1
@entity19 plans extensive coverage of many events , including live broadcast of events featuring @entity10 athletes			2
" the @entity10 care about the scale of the ceremony , " said @entity28 , a 48 - year - entrepreneur in @entity0			1
" the @entity31 care about the spirit of the @entity15			2
" competition begins : best photos @entity10 athletes carry the burden of their huge nation 's hopes and expectations			1
who among @entity8 's superstars can excel and live up to the @entity6 motto -- faster , higher , stronger ? i consulted @entity43 , a writer at @entity8 who also serves as editor of the blog site @entity46 , and we came up with seven athletes worth watching in @entity7			1
@entity49 the 29 - year - old 110 - meter hurdler will aim for his second @entity6 gold at the @entity15			2
@entity49 's shocking pullout from the @entity53 remains one of the most memorable events of the @entity53			1
the nation watched aghast as @entity49 limped off the track after a false start by another runner and pulled out of the competition			0
@entity49 later publicly apologized to the @entity10 media , saying he could " do nothing but pull out of the race " because of the recurrence of a foot injury			2
" @entity49 is just coming back from injuries and he proved he can still fly eight years after winning gold in @entity69 , " @entity43 tells me			0
" when i interviewed him last summer , before the @entity70 , he seemed really self - confident and had gotten over the @entity0 memories			2
" @entity72 @entity72 , 20 , is the lanky world champion who is leading @entity8 's 50 - member swimming team to @entity7			1
@entity74 is @entity8 's hope for a gold medal in swimming , just as @entity49 was in track and field eight years ago			1
" no @entity10 man has ever won a swimming gold medal in the @entity15 , " @entity43 noted			1
" @entity74 broke the 10 - year - old record in 1500m freestyle last year			0
" @entity83 @entity83 , 30 , is the first @entity84 player to win a @entity86 singles ( 2011 @entity87 )			0
the tenacious tennis star is idolized by millions of her compatriots , but @entity83 's maverick streak may also be worth watching			2
@entity10 sports officials reportedly asked @entity83 to play doubles as well in @entity7 , but she balked , saying she has not played doubles in years and would rather focus on her singles event			1
" @entity7 will be her last @entity15 and it 'd be interesting to see whether the late - bloomer can give us another surprise , " @entity43 said			1
@entity97 @entity97 , 28 , is perhaps the best badminton player in the world			0
nicknamed " @entity97 " by his fans , @entity97 is a four - time world champion , five - time all @entity101 champion and the reigning @entity6 champion			0
to defend his title , he may have to face again @entity104 , the @entity105 star who beat him earlier this year			0
" to @entity10 badminton fans , the @entity107 matchup will be the most anticipated event , " said @entity43			1
@entity110 @entity110 , 24 , is the reigning table tennis world champion and @entity113 winner in singles			0
table tennis , or ping pong , no longer enjoys the attention it got 40 years ago , before @entity8 opened its door , but it is still widely considered by many in the @entity10 media as " guo qiu , " or the " national ball game			1
" millions of @entity10 play and watch ping pong			2
@entity110 is the latest superstar coming out of @entity8 's most competitive sport			1
" he has won every major tournament in singles except the @entity15 and @entity110 's toughest rivals may be one of his teammates , " @entity43 said			1
@entity130 @entity130 , 24 , is a policewoman and top amateur boxer			0
@entity130 is a three - time world boxing champ but she may be better known lately for the controversy about her age			0
@entity130 admitted recently that her actual birthdate is april 26,1986 , making her 26 , and not january 26 , 1988 , as had been registered with the international boxing association			0
the age discrepancy is unlikely to bar @entity130 from the @entity15 but her frank admission again puts a spotlight on cheating by some @entity10 coaches and officials accused of tampering the age of athletes just to win titles and medals			1
" to take her first @entity6 gold , @entity130 needs to beat @entity147 , the five - time world champion from @entity148 who carries the hopes of another one - billion nation , " opined @entity43			0
@entity151 @entity151 , only 18 , is a fast - blooming point guard of the men 's basketball team			0
although still green and prone to turning over the ball , basketball fans and commentators hail the emergence of stars like @entity151			2
" he represents a new generation of players that may look less freakish than @entity162 but could be more entertaining on the court , " said @entity43			0
the big question ... how many medals can @entity8 win ? since @entity8 is sending a relatively " small " team to @entity7 -- nearly 400 athletes , compared to 600 in @entity0 -- @entity169 will be hard pressed to match the 51 gold medals and 100 total medals that it hauled four years ago			1
team leader @entity173 acknowledges the challenge			0
" we made a calculation that in the last five @entity15 , the host country has a reduction of 32 % of gold medals and medals in total won at the next games , " @entity173 said			2
" we do n't think we will have the same amount of medals as in @entity0			2
but the @entity10 delegation will do its best			0
" with no home - court advantage , @entity43 said , " i think 32 golds and 95 medals should be more like it			0
" given the time difference between @entity7 and @entity0 , will @entity10 sports fans stay up late at night to watch @entity6 events ? " i hope to see the great performances by our @entity10 athletes , " said @entity97 , 24 , who works in a real estate company in @entity195			1
others say they will surely tune in but only selectively			0
@entity203 , a septuagenarian pensioner and a self - described qiu mi ( sports fanatics ) enthused : " i will stay up to watch the events i like and the athletes i admire , whether or not they win gold medals			0
" taking part , after all , is more important than winning , as another @entity6 motto goes .			0

@entity8 will be watching to see how @entity7 's opening ceremony compares with @entity0 's
@entity15 officially opens friday to a global audience of billions
@entity10 fans will be paying close attention to several top sports stars
@entity8 does n't expect to match the medal haul from the @entity53 in 2008
