@entity2 , @entity3 when my son was born , i picked the name @entity6 because the baby names book said it meant " leader of men , " and i was sure he was destined for greatness			1
here 's how i pictured it : he would be very smart , win awards , go to a prestigious university and maybe even be famous			1
at 5 months old , he still cried constantly , could n't eat or sleep and was n't really developing			1
and a heart condition was detected			2
his pediatrician suggested we have a geneticist look at him			2
it might be @entity21 syndrome , he said			1
i did n't know enough to be frightened , until i went to the hospital library where i worked and looked up the definition			1
of the 25 things that could accompany @entity21 syndrome , seeing the words " mental retardation " shattered me the most			1
i pictured someone on the short school bus , rocking back and forth in the seat , watching the world through glass but not being allowed to be part of it			2
that would not be our fate			2
we would beat @entity21 syndrome , just the two of us if we had to			1
i quit my job , took @entity40 to therapy twice a day			1
his older stepbrother , @entity43 , and i worked with him at home when he was n't in therapy			2
as the years went by , @entity40 made progress , but at what cost ? i became isolated and depressed			1
the other parents in our neighborhood made friends while their kids played together on the playground , but @entity40 could n't walk or climb unattended			1
i was n't about to let him sit in the wood chips by himself			2
we had work to do			2
with each evaluation , more deficits were revealed			2
every time , i asked what i could do to help my son			1
the professionals patted me on the head and told me to accept his limitations			0
i dreamed of a place for @entity40 and i where there was laughter and happiness , where other parents who shared similar experiences could come together			1
i did n't want to choose between having friends and helping my son			1
by the time @entity40 was 4 , i was a single parent			1
with my three sons , i moved from @entity72 to @entity73 , @entity3 , where the schools included kids with special needs in their regular classrooms			0
one by one , i met parents who were like me			0
one father would become my future husband			0
we noticed that even though our kids were technically included in school , it was n't true inclusion			0
they were invited in , but they did n't have the skills to participate			0
they were often standing on the sidelines watching because they could n't keep up or understand the rules			0
i shared my dream with my friends , and together we embarked on a journey to create a welcoming place where our kids would be understood and celebrated			0
in 2004 , we opened @entity97 , a nonprofit where kids , teens and adults with disabilities can learn valuable skills to help them fully engage in the world around them			1
instead of assuming every individual who walks through the door can follow complex directions , we support them as they are and teach them skills they need to be meaningfully included in their schools and communities			0
the first year , we ran eight classes and served 26 families			0
ten years later , we have around 75 classes a year , and we have grown to a community of 800 families			0
we laugh -- a lot			0
our children have taught us not to be afraid of mistakes , so we 've become fearless in our willingness to try			0
we frequently fail , which is the secret of our success			0
we understand , and are helping our communities understand , how much these unique and incredible children will grow up and enrich our community			0
it does not weaken us to make the effort to understand and include those who are different			0
it strengthens all of us			0
he does ride a smaller bus to school , and he does rock			0
we did n't beat @entity21 syndrome because he still has it , but at some point , that goal just became irrelevant			1
he is an accomplished musician who aspires to be a dj. he is in his high school musical , has had starring roles in @entity97 's theater productions ( everyone who wants a starring role gets one ) and studies voice through a program at the @entity146			1
he recently gave a talk to a group of delegates from @entity150 who came to the @entity151 to learn ways to improve their educational services for people with disabilities			2
he made such an impression on them that when i traveled to @entity150 with a group of professionals to support their work , a delegate said , " @entity40 is known all over @entity150			1
" so in a way , he did become famous .			0
