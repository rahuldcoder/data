-- growing up , @entity1 did n't have many role models			1
@entity1 lived in what he calls a " very broken home " as a child in @entity6			1
his parents got divorced when he was 8 , and he described the atmosphere in the house as filled with " anger and sadness			0
" however , he knew there was one thing he could count on : @entity14			1
he felt a bit like a loner , just like the character of @entity14 , whose alter ego @entity14 first appeared on newsstands in " detective comics " # 27 on march 30 , 1939 , and would be reinvented through countless movies , tv shows and books for the next 75 years			1
( @entity23 is the parent company of @entity24 , the same as @entity0			0
) readers were captivated by the story of how @entity14 , heir to a vast fortune , witnessed his parents ' murder at the hands of a mugger			1
as he grew older , @entity14 was driven by vengeance and decided one night to take on the form of a bat to " strike terror " in the hearts of criminals			1
" being a child that young and watching your parents split up is a very harrowing experience , " said @entity1 , now 26 and living in @entity38			1
" and in my head , the only way i could make any sense of it was likening it to being like @entity14 when he lost his parents to something senseless and tried to find something good to bring out of it			1
" despite the chaos at home , he could always rely on the 1989 " @entity14 " film making it all better			1
and after the 1992 animated series premiered , he came home every day , eagerly awaiting the show			0
" it was a pure joy with me after every episode feeling inspired to keep going on the path i was going even if those around me did n't understand my way of doing things			0
" an inspiration to generations of people in the 75 years since it began , the character of @entity14 has inspired many fans , young and old , in some cases because of a strong identification with the character			1
@entity1 says he would have been a very different person if not for @entity14 , and that those emotions could have manifested themselves another way			1
he is a writer , creating stories that he hopes will inspire others just as @entity14 's did			1
" had @entity14 not given me the compass of justice , i may have been nothing more than a punk kid who bullied kids for how they looked or what they did or for whatever i fancied at the time , " he said			1
" i would n't have gotten such good grades because i would n't have cared about school			0
and i may have even fallen into that dark place of feeling so angry and taking an unsavory means of trying to end what plagued me			0
" there is truly something universal to how people identify with @entity14 , said producer @entity91 , who has been involved in every " @entity14 " movie since 1989			1
@entity91 describes @entity14 's superpower as " his humanity " : " when you see a young boy whose parents are murdered before his eyes ... he sacrifices his childhood in the belief that one person can make a difference , that he will get all the bad guys even if he has to walk through hell for the rest of his life , " he explained			1
" that is an origin story that not only transcends borders but transcends cultures			0
" " @entity14 " comic book writer @entity113 put it this way : " he suffers a tragedy as a boy , and uses that tragedy as motivation to become a hero capable of preventing the same thing from happening to another child in @entity123			1
there 's something deeply inspiring in that			0
" young people identify with the @entity14 @entity128 , @entity129 , a clinical psychologist and scientist , has studied @entity14 for years and notes that many young people can identify with his problems			1
" nearly three - quarters of youths have been exposed to at least one trauma by the time they hit adolescence , " she said			0
" @entity142 resiliency is also quite impressive -- only a fraction of youths who experience traumatic stress actually develop long - lasting mental health problems			0
we do n't all put on a cape and cowl , but we are amazingly strong in the face of adversity			0
" feelings of isolation and intense loneliness have plagued retail worker @entity155 for his whole life			0
the @entity158 resident said he often keeps people at a distance and has problems letting them get close			0
he finds himself deep in thought on many occasions , much like @entity14 , but he also channels it into something positive			1
" he 's encouraged me to become a deep thinker , sharpen my wits , and truly believe in strong moral principles , " @entity155 said			0
he remembers a dramatic scene from the 1990s " @entity14 " animated series in which @entity172 confronts his parents ' killer and attempts to kill him			2
@entity14 tells him not to let his emotions get the best of him			2
" before i ever make a decision out of anger that i would come to regret , i always hear that voice in the back of my head saying ' you ca n't let your emotions get the best of you			0
' " @entity155 firmly believes that role models can have a major influence over how one lives their life , and he says he picked the right one in @entity14			2
' @entity14 helped me find my voice ' @entity193 's problems growing up were quite different , but @entity14 helped him as well			1
he grew up with a speech impediment			0
as a child , he had to practice with a speech therapist in the mornings , then practiced reading in the afternoons after school			0
once he opened up a @entity14 comic book , he immediately became a fan and became more interested in reading out loud			2
" @entity14 helped me find my voice , " he said			2
the character continued to be a big part of @entity193 's life when he would move to different parts of the @entity207 and switch schools			0
" during these periods of transition , i would always have a period of intense loneliness before i would make friends and during this time , @entity14 would be there to help through that time , " said the @entity211 , @entity210 , resident			2
it 's no wonder that children battling adversity -- such as cancer survivor @entity221 , who got to be " @entity221 " in @entity222 in november as part of his @entity225 project -- see the brave and fearless @entity14 as their favorite hero			2
" @entity14 turns weakness into strength , " said @entity227 , a professor of psychology at @entity229 in @entity230 and a fellow bat - fan			2
" @entity14 took his own childhood fears and made something better out of them			2
" @entity237 could not agree more			0
" @entity14 really touched me			2
and to this day i have a sense of justice and decency			0
