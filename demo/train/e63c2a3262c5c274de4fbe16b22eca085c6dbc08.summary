defying warnings from the international community , @entity1 launched a long - range rocket on friday , but it broke apart before escaping the earth 's atmosphere and fell into the sea , officials said			1
" it flew about a minute , and it flew into the ocean , " said @entity8 , a spokesman for @entity10 prime minister @entity9			0
he added that @entity10 authorities " have not identified any negative impacts , so far , " though he said the international ramifications could be significant			0
" this is something that we think is a regrettable development , " he said			0
@entity20 , president of the global security foundation @entity21 , told @entity22 that the launch 's apparent failure " shows the weakness of the @entity1 missile program " and suggests that the threat from @entity1 has been " exaggerated			1
" " it 's a humiliation , " he told @entity22			2
" i would n't want to be a @entity1 rocket scientist today			1
" in an unusual admission of failure , the @entity1 state media announced that the rocket had not managed to put an observation satellite into orbit , which @entity36 had insisted was the purpose of the launch			1
in the past , @entity1 has insisted that failed launches have been successful			1
" scientists , technicians and experts are now looking into the cause of the failure , " the official @entity40 said in a report , which was also read out in a news broadcast on state - run television			1
the @entity49 , @entity50 and other countries see the launch as a cover for a ballistic missile test			1
" our government strongly criticizes their action , " said @entity50 minister of foreign affairs @entity55			0
" they have ignored the starvation of their people and spent money on missiles			0
" @entity66 of @entity10 , citing an official with the @entity10 @entity68 , said the rocket broke into four pieces before falling			2
the @entity72 and @entity73 officials tracked the missile , which they identified as a @entity76 missile			2
" initial indications are that the first stage of the missile fell into the sea 165 km west of @entity82 , @entity50 , " they said in a news release			0
" the remaining stages were assessed to have failed and no debris fell on land			2
at no time were the missile or the resultant debris a threat			0
" the incident demonstrates an " unblemished track record of failure , " said a @entity49 official , who credited international sanctions for preventing @entity36 from obtaining needed materials			1
@entity97 foreign secretary @entity96 said in a statement that @entity36 " can expect a strong response from the international community if it continues to develop its missile and nuclear capabilities			2
" @entity50 's @entity105 , quoting a @entity50 defense ministry official , said debris appeared to have landed 190 to 210 kilometers off @entity108 's west coast , near the @entity109			1
the @entity113 will meet friday on the launch , two @entity111 diplomats and a @entity49 official told @entity22			1
the meeting had previously been scheduled , @entity49 officials said			1
at the @entity111 , diplomats had warned that @entity36 would face further isolation if it went ahead			0
the @entity49 official said that , despite the launch 's failure , " it will not change our response			1
" the @entity124 press secretary , in a statement , said the failed launch " threatens regional security , violates international law and contravenes its own recent commitments			1
" the statement added , " @entity1 is only further isolating itself by engaging in provocative acts , and is wasting its money on weapons and propaganda displays while the @entity1 people go hungry			1
" " this was supposed to be associated with ( @entity138 's ) ascension to power			2
so for this thing to fail ... is incredibly embarrassing , " said @entity140 , former director of @entity142 affairs for the @entity143 and now a @entity145 professor			0
@entity10 's chief cabinet secretary @entity147 said the rocket remained in the air for slightly more than a minute and did not affect @entity10 territory			2
after the failure , the @entity10 government held a security meeting			0
the launch occurred at 7:39 a.m. friday , @entity72 said			1
immediately afterward , the @entity50 military dispatched helicopters and ships in an attempt to find debris related to the rocket launch , according to @entity105			0
when is a missile not a missile ? international leaders had urged @entity1 to cancel the launch , but @entity36 refused to back down , insisting the operation is for peaceful purposes			1
in @entity168 , @entity124 spokesman @entity167 had said the launch would be a " significant and clear demonstration of bad faith " on the part of the @entity1 , making it impossible for the @entity49 to follow through on the food - aid deal			1
@entity50 described the planned move as a " grave provocation " and said it would respond with " appropriate countermeasures			0
" meanwhile , the @entity177 and @entity50 ordered commercial planes and fishing boats to stay clear of the rocket 's proposed path			0
" this launch will give credence to the view that @entity1 leaders see improved relations with the outside world as a threat to the existence of their system , " @entity49 secretary of state @entity182 said this week			1
" and recent history strongly suggests that additional provocations may follow			0
" a recent report from @entity50 intelligence officials said that @entity1 is planning a new nuclear test in the area where it staged previous atomic blasts			1
the @entity50 intelligence report noted that the two previous rocket launches that @entity36 said were intended to put satellites into orbit were followed a few weeks or months later by nuclear tests			2
rocket launch may provide intelligence windfall the last time @entity36 carried out what it described as a satellite launch , in april 2009 , the @entity113 condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated			1
that rocket traveled 2,300 miles before its third stage fell into the @entity211			0
and in 2006 , a missile failed after about 40 seconds into flight			2
@entity214 , @entity215 's @entity111 ambassador , told reporters outside the @entity113 chambers that members do n't have " clear agreement " about what steps to take if the launch goes ahead			1
" but one thing i can tell you : we have unanimity of understanding that if it were to happen , that would be a clear violation of two @entity113 resolutions			2
" and @entity229 , @entity49 ambassador to the @entity111 , warned , " every time they go down a path such as this , their isolation intensifies , the needs of their people increase and they become more and more out of the bounds of the international community			2
that will be the case if they do so			0
" meanwhile , @entity245 ambassador @entity244 said countries need " to do everything possible to defuse tension rather than inflame the situation there			0
" @entity245 is @entity1 's leading ally			1
the launch came amid @entity1 preparations to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity256 , the founder of @entity1 who ruled the communist state for more than four decades			1
his birthday on april 15 , known as the " @entity260 , " is a key public holiday			0
on wednesday , @entity1 's ruling @entity262 held a special conference that helped firm up the position of @entity55 's grandson , @entity138 , the secretive state 's new leader			1
@entity1 television showed a somber @entity55 standing beneath two towering statues of his grandfather and his late father , @entity272 , while receiving applause from party functionaries and the military			2
@entity272 was given the title of " eternal general secretary " of the @entity262 , while @entity138 was named the party 's first secretary			0
the title appears to be a newly created position that sets the stage for a virtual coronation of @entity138 , says @entity1 watcher @entity284 of the @entity168 - based @entity285			1
" creating this new position is sort of like retiring a jersey number for a famous baseball player , " @entity284 said			0
" it shows a deference to his father and to the old guard , while still cementing his control on power			0
" @entity1 announced other titles for @entity138 , including making him a member of the @entity297 of the @entity298 and chairman of the @entity300			2
@entity138 was already being described as the supreme leader of the party , state and army			0
but it is unclear how directly the young @entity55 , thought to be in his late 20s , is involved in policy decisions			0
the leadership transition bears similarities to the previous transfer of power from one generation of the @entity55 family to another			0
" @entity272 is now venerated at the same level as his father , buried in the same tomb , and they are making statues of them riding together on horseback , " @entity284 said			0
" but @entity138 never got the on - the - job training his father did , so he may have this title to allow some mentoring or sharing power and decisions with his elders			0

@entity1 state media say the launch failed to put satellite in orbit
short - lived flight never escaped the atmosphere , officials say
@entity113 will meet friday on the matter
despite the launch 's failure , " it will not change our response , " a @entity49 official says
