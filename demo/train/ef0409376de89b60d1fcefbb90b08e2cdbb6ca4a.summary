@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has a rich musical heritage , but @entity0 - based indie rockers blk jks are creating a new sound all of their own			1
described by @entity10 magazine as " @entity1 's best new band , " @entity7 ( pronounced @entity8 ) have just finished a six - month tour of the @entity13 and @entity14			1
last year 's debut album " after robots " was recorded in the @entity13 and released on an @entity13 label			2
it has received critical acclaim for its eclectic sound , mixing styles including prog rock and dub with traces of traditional @entity1 rhythms			1
while their music has a global appeal , the band says its roots are firmly in @entity1			2

drummer @entity39 told @entity2 , " it is important to know where you live , where you come from , your history , what 's happening in the world			0
" although their fusion of styles is a creating a stir outside @entity1 , it took a while for their music to be accepted in their home country , where four black musicians playing rock music is still a rarity			1
guitarist @entity59 told @entity2 , " in the beginning people were like , ' oh , they are black , they play rock ... ' " @entity1 is still segregated , so you have a situation where they put us in front of a white audience and the white audience is confused , and you put us in front of a black audience and the black audience is confused			2
so it 's not an easy crossover			0
" but @entity59 said the band 's music is ultimately traditional , with their rock sound based around " ancient rhythms			1
" @entity39 agreed that @entity1 traditions are at the heart of the band 's music			2
" the last song on the album is called @entity83 , a story we used to be told when we were young before we would go to bed , " he said			0
" those fables connect to how we 're living now , " added @entity59			0
although the band have toured all over @entity14 and the @entity13 , they say their most memorable gig was in @entity33 itself , where the @entity1 dance music of @entity94 reigns supreme			1
" in @entity33 , if they do n't like you , they do n't like you			0
they 'll throw bottles , " said @entity39			0
" so in @entity33 , the fact that they liked us is a huge thing			0
when we started playing everyone just stayed and danced			0
