@entity0 , @entity1 -- forget , for the moment , about computer whiz kids who download copyrighted music for free			1
forget , too , about sophisticated hackers who can steal identities			1
focus instead on the next wave of potential computer miscreants -- criminals who can penetrate corporate computer systems to turn valves , start pumps or surge power at factories or electrical plants			1
they might even be able to hit chemical facilities			1
those folks are on the minds of the researchers at the @entity23 , where the federal government regularly trains industry leaders on how to protect critical infrastructure from cyberattacks			1
in the not - so - distant past , instructors here say , security officials relied on the " 3 gs " -- guns , gates and guards -- to protect infrastructure from intrusions			2
but increasingly mechanical systems inside those gates are being linked to computers and controlled via networks and cyberspace			1
that has left industrial control systems vulnerable to attack			1
@entity2 : hackers take aim at real - world targets to demonstrate the vulnerability , the @entity48 and @entity23 in @entity0 recently showed reporters a cyberattack on a mock - up of a chemical facility			1
in the exercise , a small group of " @entity56 " attackers staged an assault on the chemical plant			2
a larger group of " @entity62 " defenders sought to protect that mock - up building , which was constructed of barrel - size containers of water connected by pipes and pumps such as those found in chemical plants			1
the exercise used concepts that are relevant in the real world			1
among them : exploiting corporate trust the @entity56 attackers , looking for access to the computer network , do n't look for direct access to the control systems they covet			2
they know the vulnerability is elsewhere -- most likely in the executive offices of the fictitious chemical company			2
executives frequently have access to internal computers networks , so they 'll have timely access to information about productivity , output and information important to the market			2
they also frequently have access , perhaps indirectly , to networks that link to control systems			2
assailants know they can " exploit the trust relationship			0
" getting a toehold into a system in the @entity1 exercise , @entity56 members get a toehold by phishing , a tactic also used by hackers to steal financial or other information			1
they send an e-mail that appears to be from a friend or a legitimate organization to a representative , which contains malicious software and which opens a link between the sender 's computer and the corporate computer			0
subverting a system 's security having established a toehold on the chemical company 's computer , the @entity56 discovers a surveillance camera in the chemical plant 's control room			0
the camera , intended to safeguard the chemical plant , can now be turned against it			0
the @entity56 can use the camera to observe the plant 's staffing levels or zoom in on control panels and mechanical devices , gathering information that will help them in their attack			0
and once the attack is launched , they can each watch their opponent 's response			0
the ' man in the middle ' in sophisticated attacks , the @entity56 can even insert itself between the machine and the machine 's operator			0
the team can control the amount of water through a pump , while indicating to the machine 's operator that everything remains normal			0
@entity151 exercises typically last between eight to 12 hours , and are followed by a " hot wash " in which a " @entity157 " analyzes the attack and reviews ways to prevent attacks and respond to them			0
fears of online intrusions on industrial control systems are not theoretical			0
in a then - classified 2007 demonstration at @entity1 , experimenters using computer inputs altered a large electric power generator , causing it to self - destruct			1
the experiment , known as " @entity167 , " was the first demonstration that attackers could not only turn a mechanical device on or off but could destroy it			0
then in 2010 , a computer worm known as @entity172 was discovered after it spread indiscriminately but is believed to have targeted equipment used by @entity174 to enrich uranium			0
the source of the worm has not been identified			0
@entity48 officials say attacks on industrial systems are occurring			1
attackers are " kicking on the doors " of industrial systems , said @entity182 , acting deputy under secretary of the department 's @entity185 .			0

officials in @entity1 train for cyberattacks that could affect the real world
hackers could target chemical plants , factories , water *treatment* centers
mechanical systems are increasingly linked to computers , making them vulnerable
