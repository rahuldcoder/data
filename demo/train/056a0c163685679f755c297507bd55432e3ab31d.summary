steps taken to thwart a public marijuana smoking event friday at the @entity2 appear to have worked			0
protesters who gathered at a quad on the campus for the customary 4:20 light - up time dispersed without an apparent toke			1
in past years the @entity8 on the campus of the @entity2 had drawn 10,000 to 12,000 people for the event , which falls on april 20 ( 4/20 )			0
marijuana smokers traditionally wait until 4:20 in the afternoon to light up as a celebration of marijuana culture and a protest against drug policy			0
this year , the school closed the campus to outsiders and spread an unpleasant - smelling , fish - based fertilizer on the quad before enclosing it in yellow police tape and stationing police officers around the perimeter			1
hours before the planned event , three students who crossed police lines and went onto the field were led away in plastic handcuffs			1
several hundred students gathered around the quad as the time approached			1
a man began shouting into the crowd , becoming its de facto leader			1
when asked his name he replied , " it does n't matter			0
" " alright , it 's 4:20 who is ready to get weird ? " he shouted			1
" who is with me ? " he called out			0
the crowd seemed to expect him light up a joint , but instead he dashed under the police tape and ran across the quad as police gave chase on foot			1
none of his encouragers followed			0
police ultimately nabbed him and carted him off in plastic handcuffs			1
their leader gone , no one in the crowd seemed to know quite what to do			1
no one could be seen smoking marijuana and by the less legendary time of 4:30 the crowd had gone on their way			1
the number 420 has become synonymous with all things marijuana , but exactly why is less clear			1
whatever the number 's origin , " 420 " events across the country have become opportunities to advocate the legalization of marijuana			1
the expansion of medical marijuana in @entity79 , @entity80 and other states is making efforts to legalize marijuana more mainstream and making more people comfortable coming out and smoking pot in public , according to @entity86 , curator of the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity79			0
@entity89 's is one of the biggest pro-pot rallies , and attendance had grown from year to year , according to university spokesman @entity93			1
" people fly in from around the country to participate , " @entity93 explained			0
" we do n't understand why they have to come to ( this ) campus			0
" celebs and the pot culture prior to the @entity80 event , university police spokesman @entity100 said the smoke - ins have become too dangerous			1
" it 's hard to keep track of that many people high on marijuana , " he said			1
why these marijuana advocates congregate each year on april 20 is a bit of a mystery steeped in the hazy lore of the @entity112 pot culture			0
some have said 420 is a local police code for someone smoking marijuana			1
others have said it refers to the number of active chemicals in marijuana			0
another theory holds that 420 is a nod to @entity124 and his 1966 song " @entity128 " which contains the lyric , " everybody must get stoned			2
" multiply 12 by 35 and you get 420			2
@entity86 said the leading theory traces the beginning of 420 to the early 1970s when a group of students at @entity134 in @entity79 would meet at 4:20 each afternoon to smoke marijuana			2
" it ( was ) the time between when classes were over and their parents came home , " he said			0
" the number 420 signifies that somebody is smoking marijuana right now and it becomes a clarion call for others to join			2
" @entity145 : when celeb chefs get the munchies according to @entity86 , the story goes that the @entity150 teens named themselves " the @entity154 " and would meet very day at 4:20 p.m. near a statue of @entity152 to smoke joints			0
a website that claims to be associated with the @entity154 declares them to be " the @entity157 of 420 , " although it does n't appear to be current			2
attempts to reach the owners of the site were unsuccessful			0
no matter what the origin , the number now signifies the pro-marijuana culture : craiglist ads for roommates , or for even so - called " casual encounters , " often note " @entity168			0
" an episode of the animated tv show @entity170 called " 420 " involves a plot in which marijuana becomes legalized and @entity173 is devoted to marijuana culture			2
the 2003 @entity176 bill that became the law that established medical marijuana in the state was called @entity180			0
what began is a secret code word between stoners has gone mainstream			0
" it 's a form of shorthand essentially			2
as far as being a secret code , it 's one of the least secret , " explained @entity86 with a laugh .			2

arrests , foul fertilizer *dampen* " 420 " *enthusiasm*
crowds turned out , but no one lit up ; few crossed police tape
one man pumps up crowd , enters quad alone , is taken away
@entity89 's is one of the biggest pro-pot rallies on *cryptic* date
