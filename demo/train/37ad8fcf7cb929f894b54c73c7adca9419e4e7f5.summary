@entity0 -- by all accounts , it started innocently			0
an airport screener missed a bag			2
but by the time it was over , authorities had shut down an airport terminal for two hours , airlines delayed almost a dozen flights and scores of air travelers probably were wondering whether they should have taken the train			1
the shutdown of the a- 2 terminal at @entity16 on wednesday is probably typical in many ways			1
but a @entity19 police report gives a detailed account of the breach , the @entity23 's response , and some of the behind - the - scenes confusion that led to the two - hour closure			1
the mistake it happened at 11:04 a.m. according to the @entity23 , an x-ray machine detected a suspicious object in a bag , and a screener was told to conduct a hand search			1
but , for reasons still unclear , before the officer turned his or her attention to the task , the passenger left the checkpoint , along with the bag			1
the @entity41 report gives a slightly different account			0
it says the @entity23 screener picked up and screened the wrong bag			1
when the mistake was discovered shortly thereafter , the traveler had already left the checkpoint , and the screener could not describe the passenger			1
authorities shut down the checkpoint , and a breach of security was issued , the @entity19 report says			1
the response at 11:18 a.m. , @entity23 screeners looked at recordings captured by the closed circuit television cameras			1
they told police they figured out who the unidentified passenger was			0
they gave police a description of a black female traveling with a black male			0
but when the two travelers were located and rescreened , it was found that they were not the folks involved in the breach			0
the confusion the @entity23 then gave a description of a tall black male carrying a black laptop bag , according to the police report			1
that person was also found , and ruled out			0
" this process continued three more times , " the police report says			0
police found , and then ruled out , a white woman traveling with two children in a stroller , a 6 - foot white male wearing a brown shirt and jeans and carrying a suitcase , and a white male with curly brown hair wearing a @entity88 uniform			0
after the fifth false identification , authorities ordered the terminal area shut down and cleared			2
all passengers , flight crews and employees were told to leave for rescreening			0
the end at 12:22 p.m. , more than an hour into the incident , a screener stopped a female @entity88 employee believed to be the owner of the bag			0
upon rescreening , it was determined that her bag was allowed to pass through security unchecked			2
but because of the lapse of time , and the possibility she could have taken contraband into the secure side of the checkpoint , officers continued with their inspection of the area and its occupants			0
they reopened the checkpoint about 1 p.m. but wait ! there 's a twist			0
while @entity41 union representatives complained that the incident was an example of @entity23 incompetence , a @entity23 official , speaking on background , said other factors may vindicate the agency			2
the @entity23 said that a woman they identified early in the incident twice denied being the woman with the suspicious bag			1
the woman 's repeated denials prompted them to focus on other individuals , prolonging the incident			0
the woman may have denied having the bag , the @entity23 official speculated , because she had purchased some perfume in a duty - free shop , and did not have the liquid in the required one - quart plastic bag			1
the @entity23 official acknowledged the theory was speculative , but said the @entity23 hopes to learn more in a " hot wash " or review of the incident			2
the consequences wednesday 's breach occurred just two days after a @entity23 miscommunication resulted in a scare at nearby @entity154 airport			1
in that incident , a screener removed two suspicious objects from a traveler 's bag , determined that they were not explosive , but placed them aside			2
when a later shift arrived , they feared the devices were pipe bombs and called police			0
" unfortunately , these glaring @entity23 security failures at our nation 's busiest airports continue to undermine security , which imperils and needlessly inconveniences the traveling public , " @entity166 , president of the @entity167 , said in a statement to @entity1			1
" it is a shame these security breaches have become daily events			0
" @entity166 said that the " astonishing number of @entity23 security failures " has led airport police organizations to ask @entity179 to create uniformed standards for airport security			1
" until @entity0 acts to mandate these reforms , this game of @entity185 will continue , " he said			0
responded @entity23 spokeswoman @entity187 : " we screen nearly 2 million passengers a day and we are always looking for ways to improve and strengthen our processes			2
" @entity187 said the @entity23 is conducting a thorough review of the incident to see why the suspicious bag was not " picked up and inspected right away			2
