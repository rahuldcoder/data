-- adventure travel is n't always about riding waves and ascending heights -- sometimes it 's about heading inside , to explore the realm of our inner worlds			1
while it might be counter-intuitive to travel long distances to sit with a bunch of silent strangers , meditation retreats offer guidance to those on an internal quest			1
" every wise culture knows that there are times that are important to walk out in the desert or in the mountains , or go on retreat and listen , " says @entity16 , a meditation teacher whose books include " @entity18 " and " @entity19			1
" " quiet the mind and open the heart and listen deeply			1
in the cycles of our life , that serves almost everyone			1
" it 's common to worry about a week without conversation , meat or sleeping in			1
but those who persevere are rewarded			1
" it turns out in almost every case that they love it , " says @entity16			1
" things that seem like they might be difficult , such as silence , turn out to be right away a splendid gift			1
" rules vary , but many dedicated centers will ask for a temporary vow of silence during most or all of your time as a visitor			2

be realistic about your physical needs and creature comforts			2
austere conditions may prompt insight into the difference between what you want and want you need			2
a traditional buddhist meditation retreat starts early in the morning ; nonprofits will likely expect you to do a work period ( cut those carrots mindfully ) and to pick up after yourself			2

" @entity77 , @entity78 once @entity81 's northern suburbs give way to what looks like @entity85 's shire , the hills of @entity77 appear			1
native americans once used this land for spiritual rites ; even the wild deer and turkeys are calm , without any need to flinch from humans			1
residential retreats , held throughout the year , run as long as two months			2
" some come for healing , either the healing of the heart or the healing of the body , " says @entity16 , one of @entity77 's founding teachers			1
" some come because they are in life transition and need to listen deeply to what is the next thing that is asked of them or how to deal with some great change			2
" as they quiet themselves , as they walk in nature , as they listen to their own breath and their own feelings and thoughts more deeply , they grow a sense of stillness and clarity			2
" and we see it on their faces			2
we call it sometimes the vipassana [ insight meditation ] facelift			2
you look at the shining faces of people after a week of retreat , and they look like they are 10 years younger			2
they 're brighter ; their presence and spirit has been renewed			2
" @entity128 @entity129 , @entity130 for @entity136 , the @entity133 monk whom @entity134 nominated for the @entity135 , cultivating lucidity is a means to connecting with yourself and others			2
" when you are mindful of something , you are concentrated on it , and the power of mindful concentration can help you see things as they really are and you discover the nature of interbeing , " he recently told @entity140 the monastery in southern @entity130 that he and about 200 monks and nuns call home welcomes visitors of all ages and features one lazy , unstructured day per week			2
