" " this nation has come together before to support this simple , common - sense measure , and it is the law in several states right now , " she said tuesday afternoon			2

" the manufacture and sale of new large - capacity magazines were outlawed under the assault weapons ban that was in place from 1994 until 2004 , when @entity89 let it expire under president @entity90			1
@entity50 's legislation would also apply to previously manufactured magazines			1
the measure includes exemptions for law enforcement and security purposes			0

" the @entity1 report says that @entity3 , 22 , shot @entity5 from about two or three feet away and then turned to his left , firing on people -- not shown in the video -- who were seated or standing in line for the event			1
then , the sources told the paper , he turned back to his right and shot @entity29 , 65			2
" judge roll starts to push @entity29 down on the ground and lay on top of @entity29 , and they start to scamper under the table , but @entity27 is on top , " one source said , according to the newspaper			0
" at that point , you can see the suspect shoot roll			0
roll gets shot in the back , then he sort of appears halfway on the other side of the table			0
he starts to look over his right shoulder , and then he lays back down			0
it took out his aorta is what the autopsy showed			0
" the sources said that video ends at that point , but others show @entity3 firing until he runs out of ammunition , when he was tackled by people attending the event			2
meanwhile , a law enforcement official said tuesday that federal and local authorities have conducted more than 300 interviews with family members , friends , neighbors and others as part of the probe into the shooting			0

the total number has now dropped to less than 250 people , the official said			0
local law agencies had assigned about 130 people to the investigation as well , but the official did n't know the current figure			0
the @entity1 reported the parents of alleged gunman @entity3 have not been able to provide much information and have told authorities they had little recent contact with @entity3			1
