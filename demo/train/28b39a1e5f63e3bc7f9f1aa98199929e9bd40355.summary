-- the fate of a 900 - pound statue of @entity3 remains unclear as the @entity5 community debates the former head football coach 's legacy in light of a recent report that said several @entity5 officials helped empower @entity11 in sexually abusing minors			1
a decision will be made in seven to 10 days on whether the bronze tribute will remain on campus , said @entity5 spokesman @entity16			1
however , one man , the sculptor , hopes @entity5 officials do not rush to make a judgment			1
" as an artist , of course , part of me is in that statue , but i 'm willing to go along with the just or fair decision , " said @entity20 , who designed the sculpture of the former coach in 2001			2
@entity20 hopes officials will wait for emotions to " cool down a bit " before making a final decision			2
" i say wait and see , " he added			0
" nothing will diminish what happened			0
[ but ] do we throw away all the positive things that [ @entity3 ] did ? do we cross out his name from the history of @entity38 ? " commissioned to design a sculpture honoring @entity3 more than a decade ago , @entity20 attended his first football game in @entity41 and , unbeknownst to the coach , took pictures of @entity3 on the field			1
" it was an incredible experience , " @entity20 said			0
" the energy i felt there was incredible			0
" @entity20 designed the iconic sculpture from his experience at that first game			0

@entity63 concluded that @entity3 could have prevented further sexual abuse had he taken action			1

" but are we underestimating his goodness that he shared with so many people while he was living ? " " are [ the students ] in their own way -- of course , nowhere near what the victims suffered â € ” are they victims in their own sense ? i think so , " he added			0
" do we have to consider those other people ? not just @entity3 , but what he stood for ? "			1
