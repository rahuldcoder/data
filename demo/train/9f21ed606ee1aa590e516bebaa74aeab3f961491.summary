-- one morning , nearly 20 years ago , i was lying in bed			1
i was supposed to be working , but i seemed glued to the mattress			1
i hated myself for my laziness			1
to enjoy being idle , you can pretend to meditate , stare at the clouds or lie in a field			1
and then , by chance , i picked up a collection of writings by dr. @entity12 , the 18th - century wit and the compiler of the first comprehensive @entity16 dictionary			1
in the book were excerpts from a weekly column he had written called " @entity18 , " in which the great man celebrated idleness as an aspiration , writing in 1758 , " every man is , or hopes to be , an @entity18			1
" this was an epiphany for me			1
@entity29 , it seemed , was not bad			1
it was excessive busyness that caused all the problems ! so i got out of bed and started a magazine called ' @entity18 , " in order to remind people of the forgotten , simple pleasures of doing nothing			1
i even wrote books about it			1
and , yes , you could say that idleness became my life 's work			1
so , based on all those years of tough - going research , here are my top tips for people who find it difficult to just be			1
we are all told that we should be terribly busy , so we ca n't laze around without that nagging feeling that we need to be getting stuff done			1
i rejected my guilt upon learning that @entity56 in the @entity57 felt no shame for lolling about			1
their favorite philosopher , @entity59 , had praised the contemplative life , and the monks spent a lot of time just praying and chanting			2
guilt for doing nothing is artificially imposed on us by a @entity68 and @entity69 culture that wants us to work hard			1
when you understand that it has n't always been this way , it becomes easier to shake it off			2
@entity0 : how to worry less 2			2
choose the right role models			1
most of the great musicians and poets were idlers			2
so feed yourself a diet of @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , and the like			1
carrying a slim volume of verse in your purse or pocket can be therapeutic -- something from @entity89 , who wrote of " evenings steep 'd in honied indolence , " or @entity91 , of course			2
( what could be more idle than wandering lonely as a cloud ? ) it 's delightful to read a few lines while you 're on a bus or a train , then stare out the window and ponder their meaning			1
if you are new to idling and feel compelled to be purposefully occupied , sketching a flower at the kitchen table can be an excellent way to bring some divine contemplation into your life			2
the act of drawing makes you observe the bloom in a way you never have before			2
all anxieties fly away as you lose yourself in close study			2
and at the end of it you have a pretty little sketch			2
@entity0 : 34 low - cost , make - you - smile ideas 4			2
bumbling is a nice word that means " wandering around without purpose			2
" it was indulged in by the poets of 19th - century @entity127			2
they called themselves flâneurs and were said to have taken tortoises around on leads , which gives you an idea of the tempo of their rambles			2
try making a deliberate effort to slow down your walking pace			0
you 'll find yourself coming alive , and you 'll enjoy simply soaking in the day			1
the ukulele is the sound of not working			1
my wife hates it for that very reason : the twang of those strings means that i am not doing something useful around the house			0
i keep my ukulele in the kitchen and play it at odd moments , like while i 'm waiting for the kettle to boil			1
many religions still observe a sabbath , whether it 's friday , saturday , or sunday			0
and for a long time secular society embraced sundays as a day of rest , too			0
but now sundays are as busy and stress - filled as any other day			1
having a day of rest was a very practical idea : we were excused from all labor and devoted ourselves to pleasure and family			0
take that ancient wisdom to heart and declare at least one day of the week as a do - nothing day			0
do n't clean the house or do the laundry ; do n't get in the car			0
stay home and eat chocolate and drink wine			0
doing nothing is profoundly healing -- to yourself and to the planet			0
it is precisely our restless activity that has caused the environmental crisis			0
so do some good by taking a break from " doing " and go and lie on your back in a field			0
listen to the birds and smell the grass			0
@entity0 : 10 guilt - free strategies for saying no 8			1
do n't have a field nearby ? doing nothing can easily be dignified by calling it " cloud spotting			0
" it gives a purpose to your dawdling			0
go outside and look up at the ever - changing skies and spot the cirrus and the cumulonimbus			0
to indulge in a siesta after lunch is the most wonderful luxury : it softens tempers and guards against grumpiness			0
yet our culture has decided that naps are for wimps			0
a nap is acceptable only if it is called a " power nap " -- a short doze that is supposed to return you to the office with more energy to kick some ass			0
but you should nap , not for the profit of a corporation but for your own health			0
research has shown that a daily snooze can reduce the risk of heart attack			0
and just knowing you 're going to sleep after lunch seems to make the morning less stressful			0
if curling up in your office is n't an option , go somewhere quiet , like a church or a park bench , and close your eyes for even just five minutes			0
for us westerners , meditation is an accepted way of doing nothing			0
tell everyone you 're going to meditate , then go into your bedroom , shut the door , and stare out the window or read or lie down for half an hour			1
you have excused yourself from household tasks and can indulge in contemplation , reflection , and that underrated pleasure , thinking , without fear of disapproval			0
