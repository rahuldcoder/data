@entity0 , @entity1 -- smoking in youth - rated movies has not declined despite a pledge two years ago by @entity6 studios to encourage producers to show less " gratuitous smoking , " according to an anti-smoking group			1
the @entity10 has been trying to get movie studios to make smoking - free films			1
the @entity10 , pointing to research that big - screen smoking leads teens to pick up the tobacco habit , called for an r rating for any movie with smoking scenes			1
the head of the group that gives @entity22 movies their ratings , however , said the smoke has been clearing from youth - rated movies , a result of the film industry 's sensitivity to the issue			1
the alliance , the medical association 's advocacy arm , launched a summer campaign this week aimed at publicly shaming studios into making smoke - free films			2
" research has shown that one - third to one - half of all young smokers in the @entity22 can be attributed to smoking these youth see in movies , " said dr. @entity35 , head of the @entity36			1
@entity35 cited another study that he said " found that adolescents whose favorite movie stars smoked on screen are significantly more likely to be smokers themselves and to have a more accepting attitude toward smoking			2
" the @entity50 , the industry group that issues ratings and parental guidance for @entity22 films , added smoking scenes as a factor in ratings two years ago , but @entity35 said it has not made a difference			1
" in all , 56 percent of the top box office movies with smoking released between may 2007 and may 2009 were youth - rated films -- @entity61 , @entity62 or @entity62 , " he said			1
@entity63 , who chairs the @entity50 's movie rating committee , offered her own statistics , based on all of the 900 films rated each year , not just the top movies included in @entity35 's numbers			1
the association has given no @entity71 ratings in the past two years to a movie with smoking , @entity63 said			2
overall , 55 percent of the movies rated in the past two years showed some smoking , but 75 percent of those with smoking scenes were given @entity79 ratings , @entity63 said			1
twenty - one percent were rated @entity62 and the remaining 5 percent were @entity62 , she said			2
a g movie is deemed suitable for all audiences , while a @entity62 rating is a signal to parents that a film may include some material they might consider inappropriate for children			2
@entity62 indicates a stronger warning that some material may be inappropriate for children under 13			0
no one under 17 can be admitted to see an r movie without a parent or guardian			0
@entity10 president @entity96 used as her chief example of a movie with " gratuitous smoking " this month 's blockbuster " x-men origins : @entity102 , " which was rated @entity62 " for intense sequences of action and violence , and some partial nudity			1
" " millions of children have been exposed to the main star of the film , @entity112 , with a cigar in his mouth in various scenes , " @entity107 said			0
" i 'm willing to bet that not one child would have enjoyed that movie or mr. @entity112 's performance any less if he had n't been smoking			2
" a spokesman for @entity120 , the studio responsible for the @entity102 movie series , said @entity112 's cigar was never lit and it was limited to just two scenes			0
in one scene , the cigar is shot out of his mouth , prompting @entity112 's @entity102 character to suggest its loss would lead to clean living -- an anti-smoking statement -- the studio spokesman said			0
he said that while the @entity102 character has a cigar in his mouth in almost every panel of the comic book series , producers made " a conscious decision " to limit the cigar in the movie			0
the @entity10 , hoping to draw studio executives ' attention , hired a mobile billboard to drive around the major studios this week			1
" the billboard shows a teenage girl asking the question , ' which movie studios will cause me to smoke this summer ? ' " @entity107 said			0
the alliance will keep an online scorecard throughout the summer to count " how many tobacco impressions each studio delivers to @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity62 audiences , " she said			0
" at the end of the summer , whichever studio has delivered the most tobacco impressions to youth audiences will be named in a billboard that will run outside of their headquarters , " she said			0
@entity50 spokeswoman @entity161 said the group " is very sensitive to the concerns of parents about the purpose of the rating systems			2
" " it 's reflective of society , " @entity161 said			0
" it 's really a tool for parents to help determine what their kids see			0
" they began factoring smoking scenes into the ratings two years ago as " a reflection of changes in society and health concerns , " she said			0
" smoking is rated like all the other factors , including violence and sex , " she said			1
@entity35 said it should be absolute -- and not just a factor			0
" any movie with smoking should be rated r , " he said			1
" and if they worry about an r rating hurting their profits , then they should work with studios to remove smoking from films that hurt youth			1
" @entity63 , whose committee makes the decisions , indicated such a zero - tolerance policy would not be accepted .			0
