@entity0 -- new details emerged of what the @entity3 knew about the @entity5 targeting of conservative groups , with spokesman @entity7 disclosing chief of staff @entity8 was among the top officials made aware of the matter late last month			1
in a new timeline provided by @entity7 to reporters on monday , general counsel @entity12 learned on april 24 of a pending @entity17 inspector general 's report on how @entity5 staff used criteria targeting conservative groups in assessing eligibility for tax - exempt status			1
according to @entity7 , @entity12 told @entity8 as well as other @entity17 officials about the pending report			1
it was the first time the @entity3 acknowledged that @entity8 was aware of the report before it became public in early may			1
@entity5 : by the numbers in addition , @entity7 made clear that the information @entity12 received on april 24 included details of improper acts by @entity5 officials			1
at the same time , @entity7 emphasized that the information was preliminary and could have changed before the inspector general released his final report on may 14			0
@entity7 insisted no one -- including @entity12 and @entity8 -- told president @entity37 anything about the inspector general 's pending report before media reports about it began appearing on may 10			1
" we knew the subject of the investigation and we knew the nature of some of the potential findings , but we did not have a copy of the draft report , " @entity7 said			0
" we did not know the details , the scope , or the motivation surrounding the misconduct and we did not know who was responsible			0
most importantly , the report was not final and still very much subject to change			0
" opinion : what happened to @entity37 's promise ? however , the new information on monday continued a perception of a @entity3 on the defensive over the issue , one of at least three controversies dogging @entity37 as his second term reaches the four - month mark			1
the @entity67 will hold the second congressional hearing on the matter tuesday , after the @entity70 grilled the outgoing acting commissioner of the @entity5 last friday			1
on monday , the @entity67 panel 's @entity74 chairman and ranking @entity76 sent a letter to the @entity5 official , @entity78 , seeking an exhaustive list of information about the case			1
another hearing is set for wednesday by a third panel -- the @entity83			0
some @entity76 are calling for a special investigation into the @entity5 matter , in which tax officers assessing applications for tax - exempt status used key words such as " tea party " in determining levels of scrutiny			0
@entity1 poll : @entity95 helps @entity37 survive brutal week separately on monday , a @entity98 tea party group filed the first lawsuit against the @entity101 government stemming from the @entity5 targeting			1
" the @entity5 and its agents singled out groups like @entity105 for intensive and intrusive scrutiny , probing their members ' associates , speech , activities and beliefs , " according to the suit filed in @entity113			1
" @entity105 and its members suffered years of delay and expense while awaiting the exemption and spending valuable time and money answering the @entity5 ' questions			0
the result was a muffling and muzzling of free expression " the lawsuit claimed			0
the group alleged violations under the @entity127 as well as violations of its constitutional rights guaranteeing free expression and equal protection under the law			0
opinion : we 're pointing a gun at our democracy @entity7 offered the new timeline in response to the first question at his daily media briefing , when a reporter noted " confusion " over what @entity12 was told about the inspector general report in late april			0
he noted the report found no outside intervention in the @entity5 targeting of what he called " inappropriate scrutinizing of conservative groups " seeking tax - exempt status , and that no one in the @entity3 intervened in the inspector general 's review or " did anything that could be see as intervening			1
" in addition , @entity7 said , the misconduct had stopped in may 2012 , almost a year before @entity12 or anyone else at the @entity3 were told of it by anyone at @entity17			1
at the same time , @entity7 disclosed that @entity3 and @entity17 officials discussed the pending inspector general 's report in the weeks before its formal release , even though he said no one told @entity37 about it			1
the @entity3 first was notified of the upcoming report , known as an audit , on april 16 , he said , calling that a routine notification also provided to @entity170			1
@entity12 was told about it eight days later and she informed @entity8 and others about it shortly thereafter , @entity7 said			0
" @entity12 was informed that the inspector general for tax administration was completing a report about line @entity5 employees improperly scrutinizing what are known 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations by using words such as ' tea party ' and ' patriot ' , " he said			1
in particular , @entity7 said that " at no time did anyone on the @entity3 staff intervene with the @entity5 inspector general audit			1
" " there were communications between the @entity191 's office and @entity3 chief of staff 's office with treasury office of general counsel and @entity17 's chief of staff office to understand the anticipated timing of the release of the report and potential findings by the " inspector general , he said , but added that @entity12 acted properly in not informing the president			1
@entity5 official denies intentional political targeting , lying to @entity170 " the cardinal rule , as i said , is you do not intervene in an independent investigation and you do not do anything that would be , that would give such an appearance particularly when the final conclusions , as was the case here , have not been reached , " @entity7 said			2
" that is the doctrine we followed and the bottom line is , and this is n't just the most important fact , it is what we have said from the beginning - neither the @entity3 nor @entity17 intervened in the inspector general 's audit			2
" last week , @entity78 blamed a huge increase in workload , rather than deliberate targeting , for " foolish mistakes " in the political discrimination cited by the inspector general 's report			0
he told the @entity70 that the @entity5 division handling requests for tax exempt status was overwhelmed by a surge that followed the @entity232 's @entity231 decision			2
" i think that what happened here was that foolish mistakes were made by people who were trying to be more efficient in their workload selection , " @entity78 said , calling the practices described in the inspector general 's report as " intolerable " and a " mistake , " but " not an act of partisanship			0
" he apologized for what he later called " horrible customer service , " but he also stubbornly rejected any accusation that it amounted to politicizing the work of the @entity5			0
however , @entity76 noted the increased requests for tax exempt status did n't kick in until 2011 , months after the targeting began , according to the inspector general 's report			2
rep. @entity251 , chairman of the @entity76 - led panel , and other @entity76 members sought to depict the controversy as indicative of government gone wild , with the @entity5 abusing conservative groups and other political foes of the administration			0
democrats on the committee also expressed outrage at the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status , but they pointed out that the top @entity5 official at the time was appointed by @entity76 president @entity266 , not @entity37			1
opinion : @entity5 scandal is about donors , not tax they also noted that the inspector general 's report stated there was no evidence of any political motivation for what happened , or influence from outside the @entity5			2
the @entity17 oversees the quasi-independent @entity5			0
some @entity76 are trying to find a link between the @entity37 administration and the @entity5 targeting			1
according to the inspector general 's report , the @entity5 developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities , which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax - exempt status			2
the controversial move began in early 2010 and continued for more than 18 months , the report said , declaring that " the @entity5 used inappropriate criteria that identified for review @entity290 and other organizations applying for tax - exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention			2
" among the criteria used by @entity5 officials to flag applications was a " @entity304 " list , which was discontinued in 2012 , the report said			2
conservative groups complain their requests were delayed for months or even years through the targeting that sought to prevent ineligible political groups from getting tax exempt status			0
@entity78 testified friday that determining the political nature of groups was one of the hardest tasks of @entity5 officers tasked with assessing requests for tax exempt status			0
the investigation by the treasury inspector general for tax administration was initiated after congressional complaints began to surface in the media in 2012 that the @entity5 was targeting conservative groups and holding up applications			2
in a written response included in the report , the @entity5 commissioner of the @entity321 said there was no criminal behavior behind the actions of the agents , but rather inefficient management			2
@entity37 called the inspector general 's findings outrageous and forced @entity78 's resignation			0
in addition , the commissioner of the @entity5 ' @entity321 and @entity333 also announced his retirement thursday			0
@entity336 will leave in june , according to an internal @entity5 memo provided to @entity1			0
@entity78 also is scheduled to exit then			0
@entity37 has appointed @entity338 , a @entity3 budget office official who has served in both @entity74 and @entity76 administrations , to succeed @entity78 through the end of the fiscal year on september 30			1
