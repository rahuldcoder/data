@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 states have seen drops in tourism linked to the @entity9 oil spill in the @entity5 , though it has not caused any beaches to close , tourism officials told @entity2 wednesday			1
more worrisome than the people who call to cancel are those who do n't call to book their trip in the first place , said @entity15 , a spokeswoman for visit @entity16 , the state 's tourism bureau			1
hoteliers have a shot at dissuading worried would - be vacationers who call to cancel , she said			0
but they are unable to have any effect on those who opt not to book travel to the state in the first place , she said			0
tourism in @entity16 is a $ 65 billion industry that employs more than a million people , rep. @entity30 , @entity16 , told the @entity31 on wednesday			1
complete coverage of @entity5 oil spill " and so we are devastated , " she said			1
they 're not coming to the hotels			0
they 're canceling , not coming to @entity16			1

" @entity16 has $ 2.5 million in its coffers for use in advertising and is making plans to use the $ 25 million promised this week by @entity9 , @entity41 said			1
@entity47 's coastal area , known more for sport fishing than for beachgoing , is also suffering			1
gov. @entity50 toured part of @entity47 's vast coastal marsh wednesday and found thick , oily sludge encroaching on the fragile ecosystem			1
" we saw some heavy oil stranded in the wetlands			2
the oil is no longer just a projection or miles from our shore			2
it is on our shores and in our marsh , " @entity50 said at a news conference after the airboat tour in @entity62			0
according to @entity67 , about 35 miles of @entity47 shoreline has been affected by oil			1
the annual @entity70 in the town of @entity72 the last weekend in july has been canceled so resources can be concentrated on the oil , @entity2 affiliate @entity69 reported			1
on @entity76 , the annual @entity75 is still on for july , but could be called off , local officials told @entity69			2
several other fishing rodeos have been canceled			2
the good news is that the state on wednesday reopened three oyster beds and parts of two others that have not been affected by the oil , the station reported			2
the @entity87 website assures visitors and potential visitors that there is no need to change travel plans , as the spill risk lies mostly east of the mouth of the @entity95 and 75 percent of coastal fishing waters are west of there			2
@entity9 promised $ 15 million apiece to @entity47 , @entity1 and @entity98 to help the states attract visitors			1
@entity98 tourism spokeswoman @entity101 said her state has seen a small number of cancellations , but it has launched a $ 1.5 million ad campaign that it plans to supplement with @entity9 's money			1
" i think we are getting word out with the tourism campaign , " she said			0
in @entity1 , about half of the people who had made vacation plans along the state 's coast before the april 20 spill have canceled them , said @entity117 , president of the @entity118			1
and it gets worse , he said			0
" what 's happening is we are not getting the phone calls to book , " he said			0
" it 's almost come to an 80 percent reduction in calls for future bookings			0
" the tourism commission has spent $ 600,000 of its own money for an advertising campaign set to begin monday " to let people know we are open , " he said			1
he predicted the state would begin using money from @entity9 -- which he credited for moving quickly -- starting next week			1
but he bemoaned the image that the disaster has conjured among many			0
" the perception is that everybody has oil on the beach and we are all closed up , " he said			0
" no beaches are closed , period			0
" all the state waters are open and open to all activities , he stressed			0
for some , the ripple effects of the spill have yet to hit shore			2
@entity148 , owner of @entity150 's @entity149 in @entity151 , @entity1 , said business at his seafood restaurant located 150 yards from the high - tide mark is pretty good			1
" the truth of the matter is it has n't affected me yet , " he said			0
" i do n't think it has			0
" but he has already seen the price for shrimp shoot up from $ 4.75 per pound last year to $ 6.75			0
at about 500 pounds per week , that adds up , he said			0
and , the 63 - year - old restaurateur said , " if the stuff starts starts hitting our beaches , i 'm sure we 'll be affected			2
" whatever happens , though , he vowed to stay put			0
" i ai n't leaving @entity151 , " said @entity148 , whose mother in 1964 founded the restaurant , which has survived other challenges			2
after @entity170 filled it with eight feet of water in 2005 , he and other relatives rebuilt it in 55 days , he said			2
asked wednesday in the congressional hearing how he planned to address the long - term issue of the psychological impact on the area -- the fact that people might not visit the @entity5 or eat its seafood because they fear contamination -- @entity9 , president and chairman of @entity9 , was stumped			1
in testimony to the @entity184 , he told rep. @entity185 , @entity47 , " i do n't have a specific answer for that , but i do want to let you know that our intent is to stand behind what we 're saying , and it does n't end when the cleanup ends			1
