-- some tennis players say they look deep into draws			0
others claim they simply look at their next opponent			0
but one thing everyone agrees on is that draws can make all the difference			0
take @entity9 , for example			0
when organizers went against the world rankings and named @entity14 as the top seed instead of @entity16 , who was pushed down to no. 2 , it helped the former			1
@entity16 's early path was filled with hard - hitting , dangerous players and the @entity20 suffered yet another upset at the @entity22 , losing to @entity24 's @entity23 in the fourth round			2
@entity14 , meanwhile , had a less bumpy road to the second week and he stepped up his game in the final to top @entity29			1
@entity29 , of course , was n't such an easy draw for @entity14 , especially on grass			1
the two took part in a five - set classic and without an injured @entity16 at the @entity37 , they 'll be expected to meet in the final again in @entity38 in a little over two weeks , despite a recent wobble from @entity14			1
as the top two seeds , they were placed on opposite sides of the draw thursday , with @entity14 appearing to land in the more difficult half			0
he could face 2012 champion @entity44 or resurgent @entity46 winner @entity45 in the quarterfinals and either @entity48 or the big - serving @entity49 in the last four			0
@entity48 upset @entity14 on the hard courts of the @entity51 in january and stretched @entity14 to five sets at the @entity37 last year			1
@entity14 , like @entity44 , is n't in great form , having slumped at warm - up tournaments			2
@entity29 , going for an 18th major , might meet huge servers in the second and third rounds , @entity57 and @entity58 , and the highest seed in his quarter is the man who has been compared to the @entity62 , @entity61			2
in his half lie fourth seed @entity64 -- @entity29 is 16 - 0 against the highest - ranked @entity20 at the tournament in @entity16 's absence -- and @entity67			2
although @entity67 has ousted @entity29 in two of their last three encounters , one at the @entity37 in 2012 , he enters the event in poor form and confronts feisty @entity24 @entity73 in the first round			1
in the women 's draw , @entity75 surfaced in the same quarter as @entity78 , who is trying to reach a grand slam quarterfinal for the first time this season			1
@entity78 crashed out early in @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , but she beat @entity75 to win the @entity85 in @entity85 last weekend			2
also in her half are @entity9 finalists @entity88 and @entity89			1
both have struggled since leaving the grass , yet in @entity89 's case that might be due to injury			0
whoever emerges from the fourth quarter will be the favorite to reach the final , and the leading contenders are @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
@entity101 trumped @entity100 in the @entity104 final and won another bruising contest in @entity85 last week			0
@entity102 is an elder stateswoman at 34 but her first - round foe , @entity108 's @entity107 , is even older at nearly 44			1
the last time they met at a major , @entity102 prevailed 8 - 6 in the third set at @entity9 in 2011 .			0

@entity29 plays his first - round match at the @entity37 against @entity114
world no. 1 @entity14 *begins* against a young @entity117 , @entity118
@entity78 starts against @entity120 and is in @entity75 's quarter
@entity9 finalists @entity88 and @entity89 could meet in the last eight
