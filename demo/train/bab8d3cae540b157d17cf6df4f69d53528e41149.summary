-- since taking the helm of @entity3 after years in @entity5 's upper echelon , @entity1 has been at the center of plenty of talk not focused on turning around the once - mighty web giant			1
as @entity15 's most prominent woman , her appearance , her motherhood and the way her policies will affect female employees have all , fairly or not , been the subject of spirited discussion			1
now , a two - page photo spread in september 's @entity21 has them talking again			1
in the photo , @entity22 lies upside - down on a backyard lounge chair , wearing a blue @entity27 dress			1
her blond hair fans out at the foot of the chair , her @entity29 stiletto heels point toward the top and she holds a tablet computer featuring a stylized image of her face			2
in the minds of some , that single image is enough to undo a 3,000 - word article -- the first in - depth interview @entity22 has granted since taking the reins at @entity3 -- that focuses on her successes and vision in a male - dominated tech world			1
" nothing says , ' i 'm a powerful woman ' like a photo of you upside down on a weird couch , " @entity47 , an editor at @entity48 , said on @entity49			0
" nice work , @entity21			1
" " being equal means you can be ( feminine ) and smart , " wrote online business consultant @entity56			0
" however , still wincing over @entity1 all stretched out for @entity21			1
" some people focused less on the photo and main article than they did on what they deemed a questionable sidebar piece titled " what would @entity64 ? : a @entity66 to @entity67			0
" " @entity1 's ascent up the corporate ladder and to the top of the tech world are enough to make her the mentor every working woman wants , " the piece reads			1
" but her uncanny ability to perfectly answer that age - old fashion question : what is work - appropriate ? is equally worth emulating			2
" it follows with a five - panel slideshow of outfits presumably inspired by @entity22			2
" @entity84 ... " read the one - sound review of @entity83 economics reporter @entity82 on @entity49			0
@entity22 has made no secret of her love for design and fashion			0
the article , in which writer and @entity92 editor - in - chief @entity90 calls her an " unusually stylish geek , " is her second appearance in @entity21 , following a 2009 feature when she was one of @entity5 's top leaders			1
read : how @entity1 makes her own rules much of the online response on monday , the first day other publications could run the image , remained focused on the article itself , with much of it praising @entity22 and the steps she has taken to begin a turnaround at a once - faltering @entity3			1
others said the photo , like it or not , should n't take away from the overall look at @entity22 's life and career			2
@entity113 , founder of women 's website @entity114 , argued in a column for @entity117 that " women who hold any position of authority get it coming and going " when it comes to their appearance			1
ignore it ? you lack self - respect			0
focus on it ? you 're superficial			0
if anything , she writes , @entity22 's photo and other recent debates " make me yearn for a time when female competence in one area is not undermined by enthusiasm for another -- in which women in positions of power are so commonplace that we do not feel compelled to divine motive or find symbolism in every remark they make , corporate policy they enact or fashion spread they pose for			1
" in the article , in which @entity22 reveals a fondness for even numbers , cashmere boleros , pineapple milkshakes and @entity156 , she also provides insight into her first year at @entity3 's helm			1
who works from home and how they do it on her vision for @entity3 : " close your eyes and listen to this list			2
e-mail , maps , weather , news , stock quotes , share photos , group communication , sport scores , games			0
you 're listening to what people do on their mobile phones			0
and it sounds like a list of what @entity3 does			2
" on buying blogging site @entity187 : " i 've done now between three and four dozen acquisitions in my career ... and i 've never seen this kind of lock - and - key fit between two companies			0
@entity191 is the youngest on the @entity192			0
" on her controversial move to end work - from - home at @entity3 : ( in a conversation with web investor and pioneer @entity197 ) " @entity22 elaborates , a little defensively , on her reasons for the change			1
she never meant it as any kind of larger statement about society , but simply as the right decision for @entity3 , where by various accounts working from home often meant hardly working			2
teams are happier now that absent participants do n't teleconference in for meetings			0
messages on @entity3 's ' devel - random ' e-mail list , the company 's informal forum , have lately turned positive			1
and in perhaps the clearest sign of support , employees have , she tells @entity220 , ' stopped leaking my e-mails ' to the press			0
" on getting ahead in @entity15 : " i did n't set out to be at the top of technology companies			0
i 'm just geeky and shy and i like to code			0
... it 's not like i had a grand plan where i weighed all the pros and cons of what i wanted to doâ € ” it just sort of happened			0

@entity3 **ceo** @entity1 is the subject of a 3,000 - word *profile* in @entity21

some find the image *inappropriate* for a **ceo**
*defenders* say women 's *interests* should n't undermine their work
