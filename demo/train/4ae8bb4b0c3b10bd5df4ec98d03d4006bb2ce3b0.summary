" our customers do not believe that old - style trade union militancy is relevant to our efforts to move @entity5 back toward profitability			1

" this dispute is not settled			0
passing the buck to the courts to do management 's job for them was never going to be the answer , " they said , warning they could vote again to strike			2

@entity5 has been losing hundreds of millions of dollars each quarter this year			1
cabin crew staff voted overwhelmingly in favor of the strike			2

some 10,288 workers voted , of about 14,000 cabin crew staff overall			0
the airline 's legal counsel , @entity90 , told the presiding judge that the balloting process contained " serious and substantial irregularities			2
" @entity90 called the union 's action in choosing to strike over christmas " willfully disproportionate and clearly unlawful			2
" he referred several times to the serious disruption that would be felt by the airline 's passengers , saying some " ordinary people will find it very difficult to understand			1
" @entity52 said management imposed terms on the union members without agreement , and when @entity20 asked a court to stop it , the court did not			0
the fact that the court has now blocked the union from striking " shows an imbalance in employment law , " he said			0

the drivers said they will strike friday and saturday , and again december 26 and 27			0
@entity169 , however , said service would not be affected , because drivers from @entity175 and @entity176 would be used			0
