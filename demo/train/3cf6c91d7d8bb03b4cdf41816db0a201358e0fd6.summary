@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prosecutors said thursday they charged a woman with murder after she admitted giving birth to and smothering eight babies over a 17 - year period in northern @entity1			1
the woman , @entity11 , said she hid the pregnancies and deaths from her husband , who said he had no idea what she had done , prosecutor @entity9 told reporters			1
@entity11 is overweight and was able to conceal the pregnancies , he said			1
@entity11 told investigators the reason she killed the babies was that she did not want to have any more children and did not want to see doctors for contraceptives , @entity9 said			2
despite earlier reports that the husband had been charged , @entity9 said he was free to go but may still be investigated			1
@entity9 said he personally still had " doubts " about the father 's story			1
" the sky has fallen in on his head , " @entity9 said of the father , @entity34 - @entity33			2
" he indicated he had no idea she was pregnant			2
" @entity9 said there are no other babies ' bodies left to be found			1
the case came to light when a couple gardening in their backyard in the northern town of @entity49 found two babies ' bodies in sealed plastic bags and called police			1
police spoke to @entity11 and her husband , who had previously lived in the home , and @entity11 admitted immediately that she was the mother of the two babies , @entity9 said			1
she then told police about six others concealed in their garage , @entity9 said			1
those six bodies were also in sealed plastic bags but were covered by various objects , he said			1
@entity11 , a nurse , had psychological problems from her first pregnancy , said @entity34 - @entity68 , the lawyer for her husband			1
" my client is in a deep state of shock , " @entity68 told @entity2 affiliate @entity70			0
" he had no idea about this			0
he has totally fallen apart			0
" the babies were born between 1989 and 2006 , but their exact birthdates are n't known , @entity9 said			0
" she knew that she was pregnant every time , and she has admitted this , " @entity9 said			1
@entity11 " answered in a very straightforward way			0
" @entity11 and her husband have two adult daughters , but it was a difficult first pregnancy that sparked her actions , @entity9 said			1
because of her weight , the first pregnancy was " traumatic , " and she did n't want to go through it again , he said			0
@entity91 did not explain why @entity11 went through a second pregnancy with her other daughter before apparently committing the crimes			0
@entity34 - @entity33 hopes the public does not make " simplistic conclusions " about his wife , @entity68 told @entity70			1
the family members " are supporting the wife and the mother because they realize she has serious problems , " he said			2
" there is no rejection of her as a wife and mother			2
" psychotherapist @entity108 told @entity2 that very little was known about incidences of infanticide because it was a taboo subject			0
a paper published in the @entity113 by researchers in @entity115 estimated that 2.1 cases of infanticide occurred for every 100,000 births , but @entity119 said the body of psychological research was " slim			0
" @entity123 suggested that women who denied or concealed their pregnancies , for whatever reason , were a " high - risk " group , she said			2
but other factors could trigger infanticide as well			0
" it could actually be to do with the social isolation of the mother , or it could be their psychopathology prior to pregnancy , " @entity119 told @entity2			0
" for example , do they have a history of substance abuse or other mental health concerns that have contributed to them being in this situation which they can not accept as a reality ? " postnatal depression could also be a possible contributory factor , she said			0
" that could be because when they 're depressed they 're not really of sound mind			0
it could be that they genuinely believe they are unworthy to be a parent			0
or it could just be the level of disordered thinking that comes with being depressed			0
" @entity2 's @entity157 contributed to this report .			2
