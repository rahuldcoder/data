-- with the news that a @entity5 citizen has been diagnosed with @entity6 on @entity8 soil , the @entity2 administration must finally act to ensure that the disease does not spread further			1
for weeks , i have been calling upon the administration to take a robust , proactive approach to prevent @entity6 from becoming a public health crisis here in the @entity8			1
these steps include appointing a single , accountable official to coordinate with the many agencies tasked with containing the @entity6 epidemic , and moving from passive to active screening at @entity8 ports of entry for all passengers traveling from countries with known outbreaks of @entity6			1
@entity6 prompts talk of enhanced screening these common sense steps , while not foolproof , would go far in preventing an outbreak of @entity6 and assuring the @entity8 people that their leaders are not taking the threat of this disease for granted			1
the recent case of @entity6 in @entity33 is instructive			2
currently , @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , under the direction of the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , engages in " passive " screening for @entity6			1
this means that @entity36 only stops travelers who are showing symptoms of @entity6			2
carriers of @entity6 who are not yet showing symptoms could enter the country without so much as a question about their potential contact with the disease			2
instead , we rely on government officials from @entity51 to ask those kinds of questions at the point of departure			0
if they fail to do so or if the person lies on their exit form , there is nothing to stop infected individuals from traveling to the @entity8			2
can you catch @entity6 on a plane ? this must change			0
moving from passive to active screening would give the @entity36 the power to more thoroughly review international passengers before they are allowed into the @entity8			1
just as travelers are now asked where they have been , whether they are bringing in fruits or vegetables or have been in contact with livestock , travelers from @entity51 would be asked if they were in contact with someone with @entity6 , someone displaying symptoms of @entity6 , or if they have any symptoms of @entity6			0
if the answer is yes or suspicions are raised , the passenger would be referred to @entity35 officials for additional questioning , medical screening and quarantine , if necessary			0
@entity35 chief : @entity8 can stop @entity6 in its tracks this particular patient in @entity33 apparently did have contact with someone with @entity6 and might well have been identified by active screening			1
this case proves that in today 's global society , great distance will not prevent a disease like @entity6 from spreading from @entity51 to the @entity8			1
it is only a few hours and a plane flight away			0
now we need to think about the next case , not the last one , and what we can do to ensure that no more americans are exposed unwittingly to this disease			0
there 's no reason to panic , but there 's no reason to be complacent , either			0
president @entity2 told the @entity8 people that it was " unlikely " @entity6 would reach our shores			1
we are now told that it is unlikely that @entity6 will spread			0
but our government should not play the odds or rely on luck when it comes to the health and welfare of the @entity8 people			2
this administration has a history of allowing manageable situations to spiral out of control before taking action			0
we ca n't be reactive when it comes to this disease			0
the administration must lead , and it must take proactive steps to ensure that the initial case of @entity6 in the @entity8 remains an isolated incident .			1

@entity126 : some common sense steps could help *protect* @entity8 from @entity6
@entity126 : @entity8 should shift from passive to active screening for @entity6 at *airports*
he says simply asking good questions can help *detect* people who might be at risk
@entity126 : @entity139 must take proactive steps to prevent outbreak of @entity6 cases
