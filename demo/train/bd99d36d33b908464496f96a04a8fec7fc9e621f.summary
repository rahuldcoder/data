-- in " gravity , " @entity1 plays a veteran astronaut who looks amusingly like @entity4 , and @entity5 is a medical engineer who is taking her first voyage into space and is having a hard time keeping her lunch down			1
they float around in the inky silent darkness , bobbing and gliding , with @entity12 spread out beneath them like a giant luminescent screensaver			2
even when tethered to a spacecraft , the two are really out there , exhilaratingly and terrifyingly free			2
the miracle of the movie is the way that director @entity25 , using special effects and 3 - d with a nearly poetic simplicity and command , places the audience right up there in space along with them			2
gravity is an awesome technological daydream of a movie , one that might be classified as science fiction , except that it is n't a futuristic fantasy			1
it 's a tale of disaster and grief and survival rooted in the possibilities of space travel as they exist today			2
part of what makes the film so thrilling is that it gives its characters no easy outs			0
the famous 10 - minute tracking shot in @entity25 's " @entity50 " was a bravura act of staging , yet watching it , you could tell that it was thought - out and choreographed			0
in gravity , though , the director works in such an ingeniously flowing and sustained way that his images all but transcend the essential visual grammar of '' the shot			1
'' the camera glides through space , twirling and doubling back , following the characters through pod doors and into the cramped interiors of satellites and then out again , giving the entire movie the spontaneous feel of a single unbroken shot — a free - floating galactic reverie			0
@entity5 keeps defying ' gravity ' with her career at the beginning we hear radio burbles of talk between the astronauts and @entity77 , and then , almost imperceptibly , a spacecraft drifts into view from the right side of the screen — it 's a @entity82 shuttle , and the astronauts are walking outside of it , attempting to repair a problem on the ship			1
you 'll surely be reminded of " 2001 : a @entity88 , " because what @entity25 echoes from @entity91 's great film — and what still seems eerily surreal in an outer - space movie — is the creeping rhythm of space , the weightlessness that places everything in a trance , turning the action into moment - to - moment semi-slow motion , a feeling of life suspended			0
simply as an out - of - this - world , zero - friction '' ride , '' " gravity " is unforgettable , yet the real essence of @entity25 's achievement is that the film 's technical virtuosity and its emotional grip become one			1
@entity1 's @entity111 and @entity5 's @entity112 are on a routine mission , but then there 's a bulletin from @entity77			1
a @entity117 satellite has exploded , causing a chain reaction			0
a shower of debris is about to come flying right at them , so they must abort the mission			0
it 's too late , though : the debris hits them , full force ( the @entity127 places us right in the hurtling metal thick of it ) , tearing the ship apart			0
seconds later , there is no ship			0
they are lost in space			0
what @entity136 thinks of ' gravity ' the ebb and flow of " gravity 's " story is deeply organic — it seems to be making itself up as it goes along , and that 's how it hooks us			1
yet what sustains our absorption is a rather tricky synthesis between our involvement in the characters ' plight and our head - scratching wonder at the matter - of - fact way that the film brings the physical realities of space to life : the sheer cosmic terror of it , the images of satellites cluttered with drifting matter , from chess rooks to tears			0
@entity1 shows a haunting chivalry beneath his bluster , and @entity5 is as desperate and resourceful and anxious and brave as @entity169 in the last half of @entity171			1
when @entity112 wriggles , slowly , out of her space suit , we realize that we 're seeing a tale of rebirth , and @entity5 's acting attains a new purity			1
she floats through this movie yet grounds it , letting " gravity " connect with all of us these days who feel just a little adrift			2
