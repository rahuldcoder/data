@entity0 and her husband @entity1 are locked inside a pitch - black concrete dugout in @entity3 , sweating in unbearable heat			1
with them is a shaman who has been chanting ceaselessly for the past two hours as strange vapors swirl around them			1
it may sound like a harrowing ordeal , but it 's one the couple volunteered for			0
this is the world of @entity13 , a practice dating back centuries to when @entity3 's @entity16 was wilderness and the @entity16 civilization was at the height of its power			1
@entity13 entails entering a stone igloo with little or no clothing on and sweating it out to the sound of chanting and the fragrance of herbs			1
typically carried out for small groups by a shaman who 's usually a member of one of the @entity16 communities in the surrounding area , the process lasts two hours			2
it can be a tough experience			2
anyone with diabetes or heart disease should forget it , while those susceptible to claustrophobia or skepticism , might think twice			0
even skeptics , however , can rest assured that they 'll come out from their two - hour session feeling refreshed , invigorated and a probably a few pounds lighter			1
during the session , rosemary , basil and peppermint and other scents waft over a vapor created by the shaman as he or she gently throws water over a pile of hot rocks in a pit in the middle of the floor			1
visitors are kept hydrated with herbal tea and are permitted to lie down , walk around , or sit still -- whatever it takes to cleanse body and mind			2
but once they check in , they ca n't check out			0
" i did freak out a bit when the shaman covered the dugout 's door with a thick blanket , " says @entity62 , who experienced a @entity13 in @entity63 , on southeastern @entity3 's @entity64			1
inner child her eyes soon adjusted to the darkness and she enjoyed a comfortable two hours			0
" the only light we ever saw were the brief sparks from the rocks when the water was poured on them , " she adds			2
her husband says he found the shaman 's constant chanting -- urging him to direct his woes and pains toward the smoldering rocks to rid his body of hatred and lighten his mental load -- a tad hokey , but the ambiance eventually caught up with him			1
when the shaman told him to " let his inner child out , " he laughed loudly as directed , carried away by the mood			2
the couple emerged from their session feeling refreshed and lighter -- physically and mentally			0
" my skin felt amazingly soft , " adds @entity0			0
" the ancient @entity99 respected the steam bath 's efficacy and power for treating both physical and spiritual diseases , " says @entity97 , author of " @entity98 : @entity104			1
" a doctor of naprapathy -- a science similar to chiropractic manipulation -- who 's trained in @entity111 traditional medicine , @entity97 says steam bath buildings made out of stone were a part of every major @entity99 ceremonial center			0
some are still intact in various parts of @entity3			0
hallucinogenic drugs while technically the word @entity13 is not @entity16 , but @entity121 , ancient @entity122 -- athletes , priests , kings -- regularly engaged in these sweaty detox sessions and took hallucinogenic drugs such as peyote to further enhance the experience			1
visitors are unlikely to be offered any peyote today , but just about every hotel in the touristy cities of @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity63 offers a version of a @entity13			1
many actually have a stone dugout , or sweat lodge , on their premises			0
they 're the main attraction for most travelers , says @entity142 , head of sales and promotion for @entity146 , an organization that arranges @entity147 and works closely with @entity16 communities in the region around @entity134			0
@entity142 attests that the physical benefits are many			1
she says the vapor created by the mix of essential herbs clears the digestive tract , improves blood circulation , energizes tired muscles and clears the skin			0
and finally , partaking in the experience helps develop tourism , in the best way			0
" by keeping the ancient steam bath practice alive , we are encouraging sustainable tourism and enabling traditional communities to earn their livelihood by doing what their ancestors did , " she says			0
