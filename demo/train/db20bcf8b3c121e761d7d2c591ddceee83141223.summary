-- president @entity1 seems determined to launch a two - front war with the new @entity4 @entity3			1
the bigger news has been about his threatened executive order on immigration			1
the @entity8 , however , has also indicated a determination to greet the new @entity11 majority leader from coal country with a series of very expensive environmental regulations necessitated by the climate agreement he announced with @entity17			1
before he takes these steps , president @entity1 should take a few days off and read a couple of books about president @entity21 's last two years in office			1
there are a lot of parallels between the two presidents			2
both liked to hide on a golf course ( @entity21 holds the record having played more than 1,000 rounds as president )			1
both had deeply held convictions			0
the collapse of the @entity21 presidency after the 1918 midterm defeat is a cautionary tale for president @entity1			1
republicans gained 25 seats in the @entity8 and five seats in the @entity11 , enabling them to control the @entity11 by a narrow 49 - 47 margin			0
@entity21 did not seem to realize how powerful that @entity11 control was , even if by a close margin			1
he also did not realize how deeply senators feel about their prerogatives and constitutional authority			0
@entity1 determined as ever to bypass @entity3 @entity21 's reaction to the new @entity4 @entity11 was to defy it			1
he went off to the peace conference of @entity54 which ended @entity55 with no @entity4 senators in the delegation			0
he wrote the @entity59 treaty ( the forerunner to the @entity60 ) refusing to compromise with @entity4 in the @entity11			0
when the @entity4 insisted on adding some limitations to the treaty , @entity21 fought them			1
he went to the country and launched a nationwide speaking tour			0
the tension and exhaustion led him to collapse with a stroke on october 2 , 1919			0
the incapacitated president was protected by his wife , who in effect ran the administration until he left office			2
the @entity73 people repudiated @entity21 by an enormous margin in the 1920 elections			2
@entity4 @entity76 won 404 electoral votes and more than 60 % of the vote			0
in the @entity8 , @entity4 gained 62 seats for a 302 - 131 majority			0
in the @entity11 , @entity4 gained 10 seats for a 59 - 37 majority			0
president @entity21 had presided over the destruction of the @entity85 -- and it did not become competitive again until the @entity87 a decade later			1
president @entity1 seems determined to reject the @entity73 people			1
he set the terms for this election on october 2 at @entity90 when he declared that his " policies were on the ballot			0
" the @entity73 people took him at his word and defeated @entity94 at every level			0
when the president 's party loses the @entity11 , additional seats in the @entity8 , a number of governorships , and almost 300 state legislators , the @entity73 people have spoken			2
republicans today have more state legislators than any time in the party 's history			0
republicans also control more state legislative bodies than any time in their history			0
@entity4 have very likely tied and may surpass their post @entity109 high - point in membership in the @entity112 , making @entity113 the most successful @entity4 speaker in electoral terms since @entity115 in the 1920s			0
if the president 's opponent reaches those kind of high - water marks after a 160 - year history , something big is happening			2
pollster @entity123 reports that 74 % of last week 's voters wanted president @entity1 to work with @entity3 rather than unilaterally issue an executive order on immigration			1
@entity127 reports that 53 % of the @entity73 people want the new @entity3 to set priorities while only 36 % favor president @entity1 setting the priorities			1
this is a striking decline for the president from 2012 ( @entity1 is down 10 percentage points and @entity4 are up 11 points in two years )			1
if president @entity1 defies the will of the @entity73 people , he will destroy the @entity94 ' chances in 2016			1
democrats in 2014 had to hide from @entity1			2
by 2016 , at this rate , they will have to repudiate him			0
that would all but guarantee their party 's defeat , with a party descending into internal strife and the @entity147 hard - liners fighting with @entity94 who just want to survive			0
@entity149 would find it a nearly impossible environment for a campaign			0
there are more immediate consequences to an @entity1 war on @entity3			1
the @entity3 will fight back , and the @entity3 has more tools to fight with than the president does ( the spending power , committee hearings and oversight power , and taking votes , to name a few )			1
congressional tools are so extensive and so misunderstood that they deserve their own column			0
it will be interesting to see how the @entity8 reacts to the new @entity3			2
outgoing majority leader @entity165 has protected the president from a lot of difficult choices by controlling the @entity11 so tightly			2
as a result , president @entity1 and his team may not even fully understand the disaster they could be creating by declaring war on @entity3			1
reading of @entity21 's catastrophic experience might temper the @entity1 @entity8			1
if not , the new @entity4 @entity3 will defeat it			2
join us on @entity178 / @entity177 .			0
