-- @entity1 has signed for @entity3 constructor @entity2 18 years after his uncle , former three - time world champion @entity5 , died driving for the team			1
the @entity8 will partner @entity7 when the 2012 @entity3 season gets underway in @entity10 on march 18 , replacing veteran compatriot @entity11			1
@entity1 's uncle @entity5 is one of the greatest drivers the sport has seen , winning drivers ' championship crowns in 1988 , 1990 and 1991 before he died in a crash at the @entity18 in 1994			1
it was only his third race for @entity2			2
@entity2 ' cars have carried his name ever since the tragedy at the @entity24 racing circuit , and @entity1 , who made his debut for @entity26 in 2010 , says he is excited to follow in his uncle 's footsteps			1
@entity30 's @entity29 slams @entity3 testing rules " it will be very interesting to drive for a team that my uncle has driven for , particularly as quite a few of the people here actually worked with @entity5 , " the 28 - year - old told @entity2 ' website			1
" hopefully we can bring back some memories and create some great new ones too			0
i also want to get some good results in return for the support my country has given me to help get me to this position today			0
" i am very proud to be @entity8 and more motivated than ever to demonstrate what i can do			0
ever since i first sat in a go - kart i never wanted to do anything else			2
" team principal @entity2 , who was in charge of @entity2 when @entity51 died , said he was looking forward to seeing @entity1 compete at the highest level			1
the driver struggled with @entity26 in the team 's debut season , then moved to @entity56 as a reserve driver before replacing @entity58 for the final eight races of 2011 , but scored points in just one of his eight races as he finished ninth at the @entity64 @entity18			2
" the circumstances of @entity1 's two seasons in @entity3 have not given him an ideal opportunity to deliver consistently so it was essential that we spent as much time with him as possible to understand and evaluate him as a driver , " he said			1
" we have done this both on track and in our simulator and he has proven quick , technically insightful and above all capable of learning and applying his learning quickly and consistently			0
now we are looking forward to seeing that talent in our race car			0
" @entity1 's deal with @entity2 could spell the end of @entity11 's @entity3 career as the 39 - year - old is now without a team with the new season two months away			1
he said on his official @entity83 account : " i wo n't be driving the @entity2 car this year			2
i wish my friend @ @entity86 all the best			0
