@entity0 , @entity1 -- i was 14 on september 11 , 2001 , and i was a freshman at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity1			1
i experienced a lot of anxiety following the attacks			2
terrorism was not a new concept to me			2
being @entity11 , i always had an interest in @entity13 , and even as a child , i was well aware of the threat and potential for hatred to manifest in malicious action			2
i became obsessed with the news coverage			2
any time i was near a television , i would tune to @entity2			0
i spent more time with @entity23 than with my parents			0
and looking back , this behavior was probably not the best for a 14 - year - old , or for anyone , but i could n't help it			0
i was mesmerized by the raw footage and intrigued by the uncertainty of our nation			0
it was exciting to be a part of the nationalism that characterized @entity36 after the attacks , but i was disheartened by its fleeting existence			0
the anxiety and fear that i experienced on and after the attacks on september 11 came rushing back the instant i heard of @entity44 's death			1
unlike the crowds of people who were seen celebrating in the streets in @entity48 and at ground zero in @entity50 , i was scared the same way i was on september 11			1
it was the first time that i felt scared again			0
i did not feel safer because he was dead			0
i was , and still am , fearful of what the reaction will be from his followers			0
i recalled the images of our retaliation on television : how i could n't discern any specific details , just the glowing green colors from night vision lenses , but knowing that i got what i wanted , what seemed like everyone wanted : revenge			0
now , nearly 10 years later , we were told on sunday night that we had brought @entity44 , the man responsible for the horrific attacks on september 11 , to justice			1
but while listening to president @entity72 's speech , i thought to myself that this is not justice			1
there will never be justice			1
@entity44 already accomplished what he wanted			1
as @entity36 watched the towers crumble on september 11 , we realized that @entity36 is not an impenetrable force , and our lives would never be the same because of it			1
killing @entity44 does not take that away			1
his actions were founded upon a deep - rooted hatred , a hatred that is shared by many others , whether he is dead or alive			0
even the end of his life alone brings fear			0
the truth is , it will never end			0
that is the goal of terrorism			0
i took this class because i felt i needed to			0
i wanted to use the skills i acquired as a journalism student to tell a side of the september 11 story that has been untapped			1
i liked the angle of hearing the accounts from children who lost a parent on september 11 and how their lives have been altered because of it			1
i am slightly older than the other students in the class , and i felt that my experiences on september 11 were less sheltered			1
i also wanted to take the class because 14 victims were from my hometown -- @entity4 , @entity1 -- and i felt that it was important for it to be represented in the september 11 narrative			2
there are children who live literally down the street from me , who grew up alongside me , who i did n't even know who were affected by the tragedy			2
my interview subject , @entity115 , is from @entity4 , and his father was a fire safety director ( contracted for the @entity118 / @entity1 @entity117 ) for the @entity119			1
i was impressed by @entity115 's willingness to speak about his experiences			1
as journalists , we distance ourselves from our subjects to avoid biases and to maintain objectiveness , but the focus of our class is centered on narrative journalism , which allows the reporter to establish a closer relationship with the people we interview			0
the stories we are compiling are not the quintessential accounts of september 11 , depicting where they were when it happened , etc. these are the stories of their lives now .			2

@entity142 interviewed @entity115 for her 9/11 project
the @entity147 students ' narratives on the children of 9/11 will appear in september
@entity142 *believes* that even with @entity44 's death , " there will never be justice "
