just in case you thought you had time to catch your breath from the culture wars , the issue of marriage for gay couples is back at the ballot box this year			2
on tuesday , @entity8 voted 61 % to 39 % to ban all forms of relationship recognition for same - sex couples			2
that 's right , this amendment does n't just prohibit gay marriage , it prevents the existence of civil unions and domestic partnerships under @entity20 's @entity19			1
shockingly , the state 's @entity23 @entity22 speaker , @entity21 , who was largely responsible for putting the measure on the ballot , called the anti-gay marriage initiative a generational issue and predicted that while the initiative would probably pass , it would also be repealed within 20 years			1
even for most of the @entity23 's old - school legislators , there is dawning understanding that opposition to freedom to marry is on the wrong side of history and damaging to the long - term , and increasingly the short - term , prospects of the @entity23 , especially among independent - minded younger voters			1
indeed , according to @entity41 , 70 % of people between the ages of 18 and 34 believe that same - sex marriage should be legal			1
vote means uncertainty for @entity20 's same sex couples in november , residents of four more states -- @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- will voice their views on same - sex marriage at the ballot box			1
voters in @entity52 will consider a constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage , and in @entity51 and @entity53 , they will probably face measures to undo new laws legalizing same - sex marriage passed by state legislatures			1
@entity50 will , for the first time in history , have the chance to vote " yes " for a freedom to marry law			0
unlike in previous years , polling shows that advocates of the freedom to marry stand a good chance to win some of these battles -- and the potential losses they would face are by much smaller margins than @entity75 witnessed even five years ago			0
while the reigning stereotype is that @entity23 are opposed to gay rights , growing @entity23 support in state - by - state fights belies this perception			1
indeed , in @entity82 and @entity83 , republicans were critical to recent marriage freedom victories			2
and @entity23 will play key supportive roles in november at the ballot box			0
there are tectonic shifts happening just beneath the surface within the @entity23 that have n't percolated to the national dialogue on gay rights			2
efforts to support gay rights by @entity23 state legislators in several states are real and indicative of an increasing realization that expanding equal opportunity and freedom to gay @entity75 should n't be a partisan issue			1
most recently , a stunning victory occurred in @entity82 , where anti-gay forces sought to roll back the freedom to marry			0
after @entity23 gained three - quarters supermajorities in both chambers in the 2010 elections , the @entity103 , the chief organization opposing same - sex marriage , proclaimed it was " confident of victory " and would show " that history is not unidirectional " on the issue			1
unfortunately for them , @entity82 republicans who believed in the state 's " live free or die " motto were quick to build a powerful campaign and harness the two - thirds of the public who opposed taking freedoms away and downgrading people 's families			1
they mobilized hundreds of civic and business leaders and thousands of citizens to make their voices heard			0
not only did the @entity23 - controlled @entity82 @entity22 defeat the repeal bill , it did so by a lopsided 211 - 116 margin			1
the most overlooked fact : a substantial group of @entity23 legislators , 109 to be exact , voted to preserve the freedom to marry in the @entity82			1
despite the best efforts of the @entity103 , history is unidirectional on the issue , and the freedom to marry is a settled issue in @entity82			2
the trend toward greater acceptance is clear , irrefutable and happening on both sides of the aisle			0
to date , 197 @entity23 state legislators across the nation have stood up for the freedom to marry -- and have lived to tell the tale			0
republicans put the bill on the @entity147 floor and provided the votes needed to make same - sex marriage a reality , making it the first @entity23 - controlled legislative chamber in @entity75 to do so			1
the state senators who courageously voted for marriage risked primary opposition from anti-marriage forces but are now garnering wide support			0
they are well - positioned to fight single - issue attacks while running campaigns and building records of public service that respond to the core priorities of their constituents : less government , lower taxes , individual autonomy and personal responsibility			0
( in the interest of full disclosure , as a @entity83 resident , i personally advocated for the passage of freedom to marry in @entity174 last summer			0
) a few years ago profiles in courage like these seemed to come in ones and twos			0
today , they are occurring frequently			0
a growing number of @entity23 legislators are choosing to stand on the side of freedom because they have gay and lesbian people in their lives who they care about			2
they 've done so because the politics has shifted dramatically , taking the peril out of following one 's conscience			0
they 've done so because they believe , like so many of us , that marriage is the most powerful social institution on @entity198 , integral to strengthening our society because it is rooted in the traditional values that strengthen our families and communities : the values of love , commitment and sacrifice			0
to be sure , there 's a long way to go before the @entity23 fully embraces these values and is consistent about being the party of individual freedom , but i 'm glad to see more and more of my fellow @entity23 on the right side of history .			2

@entity20 *approved* measure banning same - sex marriage , domestic unions
@entity221 says there 's significant and growing @entity23 support for gay marriage
