-- " i measure every grief i meet " with analytic eyes ; " i wonder if it weighs like mine , " @entity6 has an easier size			2
" -- @entity8 to sing @entity13 's " @entity12 " is not a sickeningly sweet way to show how you feel today about @entity11			1
it 's a charming way , if you ask me			2
because , as wise ol ' @entity13 puts it in another oldie , " me and you are subject to the blues now and then			1
" so , come on , let 's hear it			2
sing a song sung blue			2
it 's what red - eyed @entity26 fans did , loud and strong , on saturday when their team came back to its own diamond for the first time since the @entity32 bombings -- and diamond himself showed up to lead the crowd			1
i know it 's what @entity37 fans did a few nights ago in @entity40 , where a singalong of " @entity12 " in that team 's stadium would normally be about as welcome as a @entity45 anthem in " @entity46 " in @entity48 's bar			1
@entity53 fans , @entity54 fans , @entity50 fans and others have sung it at recent games as well in @entity11 's honor			1
which is totally cool of you all			2
it 's what a @entity61 or @entity62 or @entity63 or @entity64 or a fan could do at a home game to show solidarity , not unlike nine of @entity70 's disciples all running onto a field wearing 42			2
it would n't kill a @entity74 fanatic , a @entity76 soul or a @entity78 soprano to belt out a stanza 's worth of " @entity12 " for one inning , even if not everybody is in agreement with the line that goes , " @entity85 never seemed so good			1
" it can happen anywhere @entity13 tweeted a thank you to @entity40 -- " you scored a home run in my heart " -- for warbling his ditty in their city , inasmuch as his long - ago ode to @entity96 has over the years evolved into the @entity26 's good - luck tune			1
ok , so it 's not the hippest verse on @entity100			2
ok , so the judges from " @entity102 " would probably cover their ears			2
ok , so this is n't a song up for a @entity106 so much as it is a song that 's sung around the house by your @entity106			2
an innocuous song is n't a life - altering tribute , any more than " @entity112 " years ago lessened the pain of loved ones heartsick about missing daughters and sons			1
but sometimes , hey , it really is the thought that counts			2
@entity11 , we are with you			1
for those of us not fans of your teams ( or @entity40 's ) , it would n't normally break our hearts if we woke up to find out that @entity127 wants to move you 3,000 miles to be the @entity26 of @entity129			1
@entity130 : @entity132 's national anthem at @entity134 game helps @entity11 heal today , though , i and others like me would gladly link arms with @entity139 and @entity140 and @entity141 and don a cap with a big " b " on it and stand by your side , crooning about " @entity147 " as if if it were the greatest musical composition since @entity149 's			1
i can not conceive of what the sorrow must be like from monday 's horror , any more than i could a while ago when innocent @entity154 children were killed			0
@entity8 , the gentle " @entity155 of @entity156 , " summed it up as well as anybody could in her poem , " @entity159			0
" " i wonder if it hurts to live , " and if they have to try , " and whether , could they choose between , " they would not rather die			0
" events such as these cause many of us to re-evaluate what matters most			0
getting to a finish line is of no meaning if no one is there to care			1
winning a race is irrelevant if no one is waiting at its end to give you an embrace			0
@entity130 : @entity26 release uniforms honoring victims of @entity32 tragedy i covered a couple of @entity184 , back when it was several times more famous than any other marathon in @entity187 , or maybe the whole world			1
i ca n't recall if back then @entity40 even had a marathon			1
to see that city on @entity191 was quite a sight			0
it was n't a @entity195 crowd or a @entity197 crowd			1
it was the whole commonwealth of @entity199 , or felt that way , lined along the sidewalks and streets			0
alas , life has a way of interfering with our enjoyment of it			0
terrorism was so rampant in @entity210 once when i went to @entity212 to attend a @entity213 , the sign identifying the bureau my newspaper shared with @entity217 on the @entity218 had to be masked with tape , i suppose so no mad bomber could easily find it			0
that same year , 1986 , a bomb was placed at the @entity223 but failed to explode			0
a couple months after the bike race , bombs went off in a @entity212 town hall , then a casino , then at a police headquarters			0
roughly 10 years later , i was in @entity230 , winding down from a long day , when we heard a distant boom			0
blocks away , a pipe bomb had gone off in @entity234 , right in the middle of the @entity236			0
one dead , 111 injured			0
( a cameraman also died of a heart attack			0
) a lot of us who did n't care at all about @entity230 turned into @entity244 fans that day			1
we brace for the worst , but it shocks us anyway			0
@entity130 : @entity134 fans unite in @entity248 of @entity249 @entity11 is our latest casualty			1
we outsiders ca n't do much but sympathize with you			0
and , yes , sing with you			0
how is it @entity13 's other song goes again ? the one sung blue ? " funny thing , but you can sing it with a cry in your voice			1
and before you know , you start to feeling good			0
you simply got no choice			0
" today , i am from @entity11			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			1

the @entity26 returned to @entity11 on *friday* for the first time since the marathon bombings
*people* have been singing " @entity12 " at @entity127 games all week
the @entity13 tune is a @entity195 bottom - of - the - eighth ritual
@entity266 says , " getting to a finish line is of no meaning if no one is there to care "
