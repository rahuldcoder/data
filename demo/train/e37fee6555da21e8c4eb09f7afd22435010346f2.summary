-- @entity1 is back -- but the five - time grand slam winner says she has no plans to take on the world 's best any time soon			1
the 32 - year - old ended her six - year absence from competitive @entity8 action by playing doubles alongside @entity11 's @entity10 at the @entity12 wednesday			1
@entity1 , who retired for the second time in 2007 , spent 209 weeks as the world 's top - ranked player after bursting onto the scene as a teenager			1
the @entity18 ace has already confirmed that she will play alongside @entity10 at the @entity19 and enjoyed a winning start following a 6 - 1 6 - 1 victory over @entity23 's @entity22 and @entity25 @entity24			1
but @entity1 ruled out any thoughts of a comeback on the singles tour -- insisting that it 's doubles or nothing			1
" not singles , no , " she told reporters after being asked if she wanted to return to the women 's circuit			1
" it 's a completely different world			0
even @entity37 ( @entity37 ) now , it 's brutal , it 's only one set but still the next day you wake up , and you have to put so much more effort into it			0
" @entity1 has spent the past few months playing @entity37 on a regular basis and helped the @entity43 win the @entity37 league title in july			1
but her return to @entity8 action has given her a new lease of life and an extra buzz			0
" it was awesome , " @entity1 told the @entity8 official website			2
" it took @entity10 a lot of courage and inspiration to kind of dig me out of the grave , but i 'm really happy to have a partner like her , it makes it so much easier			2
i was nervous going into the match , but she was really solid out there , and that gave me so much more confidence			0
" after the first set it was pure pleasure			0
" @entity1 first emerged as a star in the making at the age of 15 when she partnered @entity70 to win a grand slam doubles crown			1
the following year she became the youngest ever singles winner at the age of 16 years and three months at the @entity75 before becoming the youngest woman to become the @entity77			2
@entity1 , who also won nine grand slam doubles titles , was forced to retire at the age of 22 in 2003 following a struggle with injury problems			1
she returned to action in 2005 but her comeback was cut short in 2007 when it was divulged that she had tested positive for a metabolite of cocaine after her third round loss at @entity88 six years ago			1
@entity1 maintained her innocence , but was banned for two years by the @entity90			2
fast forward to the present day and @entity1 is more philosophical about her tennis having spent years in the wilderness			2
" when you 're 17 everything seems so easy , but now i 'm almost twice the age , " she added			0
" i would n't want to come out and play one or two matches and then lose third round , that 's not my type of personality			0
" i feel pretty good			0
we 'll see how it goes this summer			0
" obviously i would n't put myself in this position if i did n't feel like i could compete at this level			0
