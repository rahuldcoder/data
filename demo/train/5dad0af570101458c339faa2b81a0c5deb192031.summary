@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's stranglehold on the @entity7 @entity6 record charts looks as though it might be coming to an end			1
the talent show judge 's latest protege and winner of @entity7 tv talent show " @entity14 , " @entity9 is currently lagging behind heavy - rock group @entity16 in the battle for the @entity20 @entity6 number - one slot			1
with just over two days to go before the winner is announced , @entity16 's re-release of their 1992 song " @entity25 " is narrowly beating " the climb , " @entity9 's cover of a @entity22 hit			1
the winner of " @entity14 " -- which @entity4 produces and judges -- has held the top spot over the festive season in the @entity20 for the past four years			2
the popularity of the talent show -- this year 's final was watched by around 20 million viewers -- has meant the race to the number - one slot in recent years has been , in effect , a non-contest because of the publicity the " @entity14 " winner has enjoyed			2
but a campaign on the social networking site " @entity44 " to make the @entity46 rock group number - one ahead of " @entity14 " winner has received massive support from the @entity7 record buying public who have been snapping up " @entity25 " in their thousands			1
whoever ends up on top of the @entity20 charts this @entity6 , the @entity56 battle has enlivened what has become a rather dull and predictable procession to the top of the charts by the winner of the @entity20 talent show			0
in an appearance on @entity66 radio station " 5 live " thursday , @entity16 's front man @entity63 swore several times during a live performance , forcing the @entity66 to issue an apology to listeners			0
and on friday , sir @entity70 , came out in support of the @entity46 rock group , despite performing on the final show of " @entity14 " this year			1
speaking to @entity74 said : " it would be kind of funny if @entity16 got it			0
" meanwhile , @entity4 has been raging against , well , just about anyone in defense of @entity9 telling the @entity20 tabloid newspaper " @entity80 " that " musical snobs have ganged up against @entity9			0
" he also called the @entity44 campaign " a huge hate mob " -- a claim which the @entity44 group have denied			0
all will be revealed this sunday when the final @entity20 singles chart before @entity6 is announced			2
will the talent judge be celebrating his fifth " @entity88 " in a row or will he be overcome by rage ? we 'll have to wait and see .			0
