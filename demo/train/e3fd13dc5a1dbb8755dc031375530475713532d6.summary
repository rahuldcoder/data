-- if a measure of a successful society is its ability to prevent infant deaths , then there is an ugly truth in the @entity7 today that public health officials know but the public largely does not : too many of our babies are dying , and they do n't have to			1
public health officials , doctors and researchers from around the world are gathering in @entity16 this week for the 139th annual meeting of the @entity18 to address the pressing public health issues of the day , and it is imperative that they focus their attention on protecting the most vulnerable members of our society			0
the @entity7 infant mortality rate is one of the highest among all developed countries			1
the disparity in rates within the @entity7 is alarming as well , with black babies dying at more than twice the rate of white babies			1
the most recent statistics from 2007 show that the @entity7 rate of almost seven deaths per 1,000 live births ranked the @entity7 behind the majority of other developed countries			1
thirty developed countries have lower infant mortality rates , according to the @entity41 , all of them spending much less than we do on health care within the @entity7 , infant mortality ranges from a high of almost 10 deaths per 1,000 in @entity48 and @entity49 to about five deaths per 1,000 in @entity16 and @entity51			1
although the overall rates have been slowly declining since 2000 , the huge gap between whites and blacks continues to exist			2
@entity7 women who are most likely to lose their babies are @entity58 black women , with a rate almost 2 1/2 greater than that for @entity58 white women			1
this is one of the greatest injustices in our country : that a baby 's chance of having a healthy life is largely dependent on where he or she is born			0
states and local communities vary widely in what care their leaders choose to provide to women and children			0
but these higher rates can be lowered by implementing strong initiatives at the state and federal levels			0
and maternal and child health experts know what needs to happen , based on what 's worked in places with lower rates			0
preventing infant mortality is not just about prenatal care			1
there are four key periods in the lives of women and their children , each vital in determining whether an infant lives or dies : before pregnancy , during pregnancy , at birth and during the first year of life			2
interventions that work during each of these periods must be consistently supported to reduce infant mortality			1
these include teen pregnancy prevention programs , such as the @entity103 to prevent teen and @entity105 ; family planning services ( the @entity107 -- or @entity107 -- nutrition program , which provides federal grants to states , is one good example ) ; back - to - @entity113 education campaigns that help reduce the risk of @entity115 ; full coverage of prenatal care and child health ; and cessation programs for pregnant women who use tobacco or other substances			1
these are examples of services that should be available for all women and infants , regardless of where they live			0
currently , the @entity7 does not ensure that women have access to comprehensive health care services for the four key periods			2
countries with universal health care that includes women 's health coverage ( including family planning ) before and after pregnancy -- that is , prenatal care as well as infant and child health care -- have better outcomes than the @entity7			2
prenatal care is necessary , but taken alone wo n't solve our scandalously high infant mortality rates			1
policies and regulations are needed in all states and in all hospitals to make sure we give infants the best possible care			0
it will take a village of support to lower infant mortality and improve health and development of our nation 's children			2
since 1935 the @entity7 government has supported maternal and child health through @entity164 of the @entity165 , which demands that states be a " point of accountability " to ensure the health of mothers , women , children and youth			2
healthy start programs funded by the @entity7 @entity175 since the early 1990s have helped communities provide an array of services and support to pregnant women who face challenges getting access to quality medical care , housing , food and other services			1
both @entity164 and @entity186 are regularly at risk in budget discussions			0
to do better as a nation , we must develop and sustain the political will to fund both programs fully as well as support all services and policies we know help prevent infant deaths			0
continuing to provide a patchwork of fragmented services for mothers and infants across the country will do little to improve our infant mortality rates			1
when it comes to the budget , @entity203 must prioritize services that will prevent poor and minority children from dying or suffering from other conditions that result from inadequate health care for mothers and their babies			0
now is the time for our society to reflect its values			0
we can do better for our women and children			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			0

@entity219 says infant mortality rates in @entity7 remain *unacceptably* high
the @entity7 ranks 31st in developed nations for infant mortality
@entity226 : rate for blacks in @entity7 highest ; funds for prevention programs regularly face cuts
she says *policymakers* must make funding for women and infant programs a policy priority
