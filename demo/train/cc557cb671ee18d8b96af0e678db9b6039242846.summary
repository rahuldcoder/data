by the time we depart @entity2 's @entity1 , we will have spent 36 hours on the ground			1
like @entity4 , whose exact location here in the transit lounge remains a mystery , we can not step foot on @entity11 soil without special visa clearance			1
we arrived early tuesday morning on a mission -- to find the former @entity15 surveillance specialist in the transit zone			1
as it turns out , this airport has an expansive area for transiting passengers and we now know nearly every corner of it			0
read more : dozens of journalists heading for @entity23 ... without @entity4 @entity4 and those who are reportedly handling him are here , according to @entity11 president @entity26			1
" he is a transit passenger in the transit zone and is still there now , " @entity26 said tuesday			1
" the sooner he selects his final destination point , the better both for us and for himself			0
" that statement came after we 'd already landed on the ground in @entity1			0
it piqued global interest in the story			0
@entity26 broke his silence on @entity4 , after leaving initial diplomacy to his seasoned foreign minister @entity38			1
legally , @entity2 has taken the view that @entity4 has not cleared passport control , therefore is not on @entity11 soil			1

the rooms are the scale of large walk - in closets in the @entity15 but with much poorer insulation			0
the kind receptionist at the front desk has heard of @entity4 but without hesitation insists he or anyone assisting him has not stepped foot in the @entity54			2
we check in and use the hotel as our airport production base			0
10 best boltholes : where on @entity74 could @entity4 go next ? after a few hours on the ground we produce a mini video report on @entity4 's movements , the locations he could be at the airport and why @entity38 says insinuations by @entity81 of harbouring @entity4 are not acceptable			1
once the story is filed , we conduct a live report from @entity50 with nothing more than a hand - held camera , a laptop , a microphone and a fist full of phones to liaise with our operations in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			0

global interest reaches a crescendo			0
the next thing we know , @entity101 is the only international broadcaster inside the transit zone and we begin conducting two - three live shots an hour			1
we do this from the center of the terminal			0
around us , passengers come and go to places such as @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
we , of course , take particular interest in @entity120 flight number 150 , which is bound for @entity121			0
a day earlier , that same flight carried journalists -- including our @entity124 -- hoping to travel with @entity4 , possibly on his way to @entity126 , @entity127			2
again , no @entity4 , but we take stills and video shots just in case			2
read more : @entity4 a ' free man ' in @entity2 airport , @entity11 president says this global game of " cat and mouse " appears to have entered a new phase			1
the @entity11 president compares the situation to trying to shave a piglet			1
a lot of noise , @entity26 noted , but very little hair to be had			2
by this point we are showing up on the radar of airport security , and so our very own game of cat and mouse ensues as we try to continue doing live reports while being tracked by burly @entity11 guards			1
outside the airport walls , international diplomacy is also getting fractious			0
secretary of state @entity154 , traveling in @entity155 , asks @entity11 for reciprocity			0
@entity81 handed over seven @entity11 , @entity154 points out , when asked to by @entity2			1
this administration wants @entity4 in return			0
opinion : why @entity15 is being humiliated by the hunt for @entity4 the two former @entity162 adversaries cooperated on the @entity163 , but when it comes to @entity4 and his treasure trove of leaked documents , it does not appear @entity11 is prepared to do so			2
we finish our last live report at 0400 @entity2 time wednesday , 21 hours after arrival			2
@entity4 is very likely still here , spirited away in a room designed to keep him out of sight but certainly not out of mind .			0

@entity101 's @entity176 and @entity177 have spent hours in the transit zone of @entity2 's airport

@entity2 's view is that @entity4 has not cleared passport control , therefore not in @entity11
it 's a global game of cat and mouse -- and @entity101 ends up in its own version of the game
