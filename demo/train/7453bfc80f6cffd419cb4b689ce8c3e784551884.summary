-- most of us have dreamed of telling our bosses what they can do with this stupid job , perhaps with the help of a marching band , if your fantasies skew grandiose			1
so what happens to the guy who actually does it and lives to post a video of the stunt on @entity15 ? the numbers do n't lie : twenty - four - year - old @entity17 has become a veritable internet celebrity , a hero and a viral video sensation			1
the original @entity15 video of " @entity22 " earned more than 2 million views a week , which includes 18,092 likes and 438 dislikes and counting			1
" i 'm goingï » ¿ to quit like that if i 'm going to quit , " one commenter said , echoing the wishful thinking of many			2
" @entity17 is the hero of all downtrodden workers because he is the embodiment of ' take this job and shove it			1
' he 's living out the fantasies of countless workers who also hate their bosses , " said @entity32 , ceo of the @entity33 , a digital marketing and talent agency			2
beyond resonating with millions of people , the video says a few things about how social media are changing the way businesses interact not just with customers but with employees , she said			1
" managers should remember that if you 're terrible to your people while they are working for you , your formerly silent former employees will have a platform to out you in a potentially very public way			1
and that sentiment can effect your business too			2
" it also demonstrates how social media are allowing employees to control the circumstances of their departure for a change , said @entity61 , a former @entity62 executive and author of " it 's @entity65 : emotions in the @entity67			1
" she cited ousted @entity71 ceo @entity70 's e-mail to @entity71 employees saying " i 've just been fired over the phone " as another example of someone getting in front of their former bosses to control the message			1
" rather than having the situation defined for them , people are trying to shape the conversation on their own			2
for all we know , @entity17 was going to get fired the next day , but he turned it around			2
" the video 's release could n't be more timely , although @entity17 made the video when he quit his job at the @entity90 in august			1
the unemployment rate has remained at 9.1 % , since july and new claims for unemployment benefits have lingered above 400,000 since april			2
those factors , taken with the @entity96 movement , create the ideal cultural climate for the birth of an @entity100 folk hero who embodies the anger and malaise felt by many , @entity61 said			2
" there 's a kind of confluence of events that 's forcing people 's anger and dissatisfaction to the surface			2
everyone 's been taking it on the chin for years because of the recession but now they 're exhausted and want change , " @entity61 said			0
" @entity17 's approach is unique in saying , ' i 'm going to have some fun with this			0
' " @entity17 is not the first , and he 's probably not the last , to publicly stage his flame - out			0
if anything , his video is the latest example of how the internet age has created a broader platform for behavior that used to be contained to smaller circles , @entity124 - based career coach @entity123 said			1
" people have been flaming out publicly forever			0
now , with social media , we have a bigger stage for our flame - outs , and there 's ever so many more places for it to be done , " @entity133 said			1
a @entity15 video posted in 2007 shows a @entity143 manager tearing off his work shirt to reveal a white t - shirt with the words " i quit " while " @entity147 " plays			1
the worker launches into a respectable imitation of @entity151 's original dance routine , complete with backup dancers			0
another take on the " i quit " chest proclamation appeared in a 2008 @entity15 video of a man who tears off his shirt and has the phrase written on his bare skin			1
he giddily skips around the office , boom box on shoulder , with " just got ta get right outta here " from @entity169 's " @entity168 " on a loop			0
the last disgruntled employee to strike a chord in the public consciousness was former @entity176 flight attendant @entity174 , who famously deployed an emergency evacuation slide to dramatically exit an airplane after announcing to the flight that he was fed up			0
@entity182 was back in the news thursday when he was sentenced to a year of probation after completing a mental health treatment program			0
his departure will cost him $ 10,000 in restitution to @entity176 , the price of repairing or replacing the emergency evacuation chute			0
@entity182 told @entity0 the past year had been " long " and " challenging			0
" he spent much of it commuting to a @entity192 treatment facility from @entity193 , where took care of his ill mother , who died this year			0
but just imagine if someone had captured the incident on camera , @entity133 said			0
each departure reflects how the person felt about his job			1
" the question becomes what 's the genesis of what prompted them to not just quit but to engage others in their departure , " she said			0
" it 's usually a combination of frustrations , usually oriented toward management , but it can also include other stressors from the job			1
" @entity17 said problems with management led to his departure			0
he said he worked at the hotel for more than three years , during which time he participated in a push for employees to join a union			1
the employees prevailed , but the struggle damaged relations between management and employees , he said			1
" they treat us like s * * * , " @entity17 said at the start of the @entity15 video			1
" i 'm going to go and quit right now with the help of my bandmates			0
" on the video , he leads members of the @entity233 ? brigade into the hotel through a side entrance			1
his boss encounters them and tells them to leave , @entity17 responds by handing him a letter and saying " i quit			0
" cue the band as @entity17 walks away , smiling broadly , hands raised in triumph			1
@entity17 said he has a new job that allows him to use his history degree , but he would n't say where			2
but it 's hard to say what the stunt will cost him in the long run , @entity32 said			0
" if @entity17 wants to work in a creative industry , he may get to keep his hero status and use it to his advantage , " she said			0
" i 'd say to him , get an agent , use this moment to your advantage			0
" finding a job in corporate america , where potential employers do extensive background checks , could be more challenging , she said			2
" he can expect to definitely be googled by hiring and recruiting managers who might take a pass on him because they 'll think , ' do i want to be the butt of a @entity17 joke when he quits on me in a few years ? this guy seems like a disgruntled employee before i 've even met him			0
i think i 'll pass			0
' " or , maybe it wo n't matter in a few years , as we grow even more accustomed to living our lives online			0
" my guess is he 's not going to want to work in the hotel industry , but he 's super-young , so do n't think it 'll irreparably ruin his chances			2
depending on the job , it might endear him to a potential employer			1
