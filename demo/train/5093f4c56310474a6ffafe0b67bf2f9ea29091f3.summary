a @entity1 judge tuesday vacated the conviction of a man who spent nearly a quarter of a century behind bars for a @entity6 slaying that occurred while he was vacationing in @entity8			1
@entity9 , 51 , was found guilty in 1989 in the death of @entity11 in the @entity13 neighborhood of @entity6 and served the next 24 years and 8 months in prison , according to the @entity6 district attorney 's office			1
he was released tuesday afternoon			0
@entity9 has always maintained he was on a family trip to @entity18 in @entity8 when @entity11 was shot to death early on the morning of august 15 , 1989 , in a dispute over stolen money			1
after years of reviewing documents and re-interviewing witnesses as part of a joint investigation between his attorneys and the @entity6 district attorney 's @entity29 , it was determined that the only evidence tying him to the crime was an alleged witness who later recanted her statement			1
" as you can imagine , after sitting in jail for 25 years for a crime he did n't commit , he ca n't help but feel vindicated , " said one of @entity9 's lawyers , @entity36			1
" on the flip side , that 's 25 years that have been stolen , that he 'll never get back			1
" at his trial , defense lawyers provided family photos and home videos of @entity9 in @entity8 around the time of @entity11 's killing			1
but according to @entity52 , another of @entity9 's lawyers , they did not have evidence he was in @entity8 on the day of the slaying			1
the prosecution persuaded jurors to ignore the alibi			0
@entity9 told his attorneys he had paid a bill for phone calls made from his @entity8 hotel room the night before @entity11 was killed , and he believed the receipt was in his pocket when police arrested him			1
but authorities told the defense he had no such receipt , according to @entity52			0
in the course of the investigation , the @entity29 found the receipt in police records , time stamped and dated -- solidifying @entity9 's claim that he was in @entity8 at the time of the killing , according to the district attorney 's office			1
" this is proof of alibi that was basically purposely withheld , " @entity52 said			0
the review unit also interviewed @entity9 's former girlfriend , who said she called @entity9 the night of the killing while he was still at his hotel in @entity8			1
the investigation found her story to be credible , with phone records to support it			0
the prosecution also produced a witness who said she saw @entity9 commit the crime			0
according to @entity52 , the woman recanted her testimony weeks after @entity9 's conviction			2
she later testified in front of a judge that she was on parole and had been arrested with another woman for being in a stolen van the night of the killing			0
she said police persuaded her to give a statement against @entity9 to avoid going back to jail			0
@entity52 said the judge threw out her later testimony because she could not provide enough facts to back up her story			0
a review unit search of police records years later came up with a timeline			0
the woman on probation was arrested with another woman on grand larceny charges and brought to the @entity6 district attorney 's office , where she gave a statement			0
within the hour , the investigation found , charges against her were dropped			0
@entity52 said defense investigators even found a witness in @entity118 who claims to have been the getaway driver during @entity11 's killing and who even identified someone they say is the real killer			2
judge @entity125 tuesday vacated the conviction after a " careful and thorough review of this case , and based on key alibi facts that place @entity9 in @entity8 at the time of the murder , " said district attorney @entity132			1
@entity52 and @entity36 say the next step is ensuring that @entity9 has a way to support himself after he is released			2
" he has no job , no career , no prospects , " @entity52 said			0
" we 're suing everybody , let 's be honest , " @entity52 added , saying @entity9 's legal team intends to bring a civil rights lawsuit against the city and seek reparations from the state under a provision set up to redress wrongful convictions			2
@entity132 , who became district attorney at the beginning of the year , has already released two men who had been in prison for more than half their lives in connection with three killings after dna evidence tore holes in their convictions in february			1
@entity158 and @entity159 were teenagers when they were imprisoned			0
but after reviewing dna evidence , @entity132 said the previous convictions for the 1992 murders in @entity6 would most likely not stand up in court and agreed the two men should be freed			0
those cases , as well as @entity9 's , are not connected to investigations into detective @entity169 , whose questionable tactics have led to a review of some 50 other cases , the district attorney 's office said			2
on monday , @entity132 named @entity174 law professor @entity173 as special counsel to the district attorney for the @entity29			2
@entity173 , who heads @entity174 's @entity177 , will guide the group in future cases brought for review , according to the @entity132 's office			1
