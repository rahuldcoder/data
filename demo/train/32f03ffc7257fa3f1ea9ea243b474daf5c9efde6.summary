-- as outrage over the shooting death of 17 - year - old @entity4 continues to grip the nation , key questions remain unanswered over what happened the night of february 26 as conflicting accounts are given by witnesses and attorneys for both sides			2
what is known is that @entity4 , wearing a hoodie , ventured out from his father 's fiancee 's home in @entity16 , @entity17 , to get a snack at a nearby convenience store			2
as he trekked back to the home with a bag of @entity22 and an @entity24 iced tea , he was shot and killed by @entity25 , a 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer			1
@entity25 has said he acted in self - defense			1
@entity0 spoke to a witness to the shooting for a second time friday , who offered new details about what she saw			1
@entity25 's attorneys , for their part , were quick to knock down her statements			1
here 's what they said : who yelled for help ? a recording of a 911 call made the night of the shooting captured someone pleading for help			2
@entity25 has said he was yelling for help , according to his family members and his account to authorities			1
@entity4 's relatives have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is @entity4 's			2
" from the very beginning and i still do feel that it was the young boy , " the witness , who wants to remain anonymous , told @entity0 friday			1
the witness lives in the apartment complex where the shooting occurred and saw the incident through her window			2
she described the cries for help as " devastating , desperate , " and something " that will really always stay with me			0
" when pressed if she could determine who was yelling , the witness said " it was the younger , youthful voice ( rather ) than it was the deep voice i heard when they were arguing			1
" @entity25 's attorneys jumped on the witness ' characterization of @entity4 as " the young boy			1
" " i 'm not sure when she came to that conclusion , " said attorney @entity71 , noting that when news of the shooting first broke , pictures of @entity4 as a 12 - year - old were the first to circulate			2
" the pictures you 've put up tonight show a 6 foot 3 boy who was 17 years old , " @entity71 said , pointing out that teenage boys can have voices that range from high to as low as a grown man			0
a police report listed @entity4 's height at six feet			0
audio experts @entity87 and @entity88 , who analyzed the 911 recordings for the @entity90 , said they do n't believe it is @entity25 who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call			1
they compared those screams with @entity25 's voice , as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier			1
in that call , in response to the 911 operator 's question , @entity25 described a " suspicious " black male , who ended up being @entity4			1
in describing her questioning by investigators , the witness remembered expressing that she should have done something more , in retrospect , after hearing the cries for help			0
" the lead investigator said to me kindly , ' well , if it makes you feel any better , the person that was yelling for help is alive , ' " she recalled			0
who was on top of whom during the scuffle ? @entity25 says he killed @entity4 in self - defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk , according to an @entity90 report that was later confirmed by @entity16 police			2
one of the responding officers saw a wound on the back of @entity25 's head and a bloody nose , and noted that his back was wet , indicating he had been lying in the grass , according to the police report			1
@entity4 's family and supporters say @entity25 , who is @entity135 , racially profiled the teen , who was black , and ignored a police dispatcher 's directive not to follow him			1
@entity25 's attorneys interpret the call differently , and say the operator did not order @entity25 not to follow			1
" i know it was very dark , but i really would have to say that i thought it was the larger person on top , " the witness said , referring to the heavier build of @entity25			1
@entity147 , another @entity25 attorney , questioned how the witness could determine the identities of those on the ground at that time of night and from her vantage point			1
" i think it was dark , and i do n't think she 's sure what she saw , " @entity147 said			0
the police investigation : the @entity16 police department has come under intense scrutiny for its actions following the shooting , and protesters have called for the firing of police chief @entity163 , who stepped aside temporarily last month amid criticism			0
the witness declined to characterize her questioning by investigators as " in depth , " instead saying " i just kind of told what i saw and heard			0
" she noted that when she offered to show the investigators where she saw the scuffle occur , she was told , " nah , we do n't need to see it			0
" she added that two phone calls to the lead detective have gone unanswered			0
her attorney , @entity176 , said a follow - up visit on behalf of the state attorney 's investigation on wednesday yielded only 15 minutes of questioning			0
" it was very general , " @entity176 said , adding that had he been in the investigators ' position , he would have had her recount her story again			0
the state attorney 's office declined to comment friday , citing the ongoing investigation			0
@entity16 police did not respond to requests for comment friday			0
what will happen next ? a grand jury is expected to convene next week and could take up the case			0
whether a grand jury will choose to indict , @entity147 said : " we do n't know			0
" until now , only friends and relatives of @entity25 's have come forward to offer his side of the story			1
@entity71 said @entity25 " would love to be able to do that right now , " but due to threats to his safety and the possibility of charges , he ca n't			2
" there 's going to be a time , hopefully in the fairly near future , where he 'll have an opportunity to tell the public exactly what happened , " @entity71 said			2
until then , @entity147 cautions against jumping to conclusions			0
" everybody wants to know what happened , but we need to take a step back and let the evidence come out , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity214 contributed to this report .			1
