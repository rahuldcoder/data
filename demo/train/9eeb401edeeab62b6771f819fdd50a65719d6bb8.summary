@entity0 -- @entity2 apologized to the @entity4 public with full - page advertisements in seven national newspapers saturday , a day after two senior executives resigned over a phone hacking scandal that has engulfed his media empire			1
" we are sorry , " @entity2 says in saturday 's ad , which will also run in newspapers sunday and monday			1
" the @entity14 was in the business of holding others to account			0
it failed when it came to itself			0
we are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred			0
we are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected			0
" @entity2 's apology comes after his media empire lost two top executives friday			1
former @entity14 editor @entity24 resigned from her post as chief executive at @entity27 , the @entity4 arm of @entity2 's @entity29 , early friday			1
hours later , her predecessor , @entity30 resigned			0
@entity2 also visited the family of @entity32 , a murdered @entity4 teenager whose voice mail was allegedly hacked by staff working for the @entity14			1
police in the @entity4 have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking in documents recovered from a private investigator working for the paper			1
there were also allegations that @entity29 reporters may have bribed police officers			1
@entity2 's campaign of contrition comes 12 days after the scandal first broke and barely a week after the @entity14 , @entity4 's best - selling sunday tabloid , was shut down by @entity27 in the face of public outrage			1
the advertisement expresses regret for not acting more quickly " to sort things out , " but @entity2 acknowledges that apologizing is not enough			2
" our business was founded on the idea that a free and open press should be a positive force in society			0
we need to live up to this , " he says			0
the media mogul pledged to take " concrete steps " to resolve issues and make amends			0
" you will hear more from us , " his message concludes			0
@entity2 , his son , @entity68 , and @entity69 are to appear before @entity4 politicians tuesday to answer questions over the phone hacking scandal			1
some of the claims @entity69 faces relate to the @entity14 's alleged hacking , while she was editor , into @entity77 's mobile phone account			1
she has warned that her answers may be limited by ongoing police and judicial inquiries			2
" as chief executive of the company , i feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt , and i want to reiterate how sorry i am for what we now know to have taken place , " she said in a statement friday			2

" the pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable , " he said in a letter provided by @entity92			0
@entity4 prime minister @entity100 has been among those publicly decrying the hacking , blasting @entity2 's company wednesday as he launched a high - powered judge - led investigation into the nation 's press			1
yet he has his own ties to the scandal , given his relationship with @entity111			0
@entity111 resigned as @entity14 editor in 2007 , after his former royal editor and a private detective were convicted of conspiracy to hack into royals ' voice mails			1

earlier this month , @entity111 was arrested in connection with claims of phone hacking and corruption dating to his days as the @entity14 editor			2
after the arrest , the prime minister took full responsibility for hiring @entity111			0
but while not denying this personal connection , @entity100 has maintained public pressure against @entity29 meanwhile , the @entity145 is also investigating @entity29 after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of september 11 survivors , victims and their families			2
@entity2 's @entity29 encompasses @entity154 , @entity94 , the @entity155 and @entity157 publishers in the @entity158			1
@entity27 -- a @entity4 subsidiary of @entity29 -- owns the @entity159 , @entity160 and the @entity161 in @entity4 .			2
