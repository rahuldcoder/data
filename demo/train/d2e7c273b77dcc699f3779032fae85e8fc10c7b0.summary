@entity1 , @entity0 -- investigative newspaper reporter @entity3 thought he faced 10 criminal cases against him for articles he had written			1
but when he logged on to a @entity0 government website to check his legal status , @entity3 discovered an unpleasant surprise : two new cases filed against him			2
" they are asking for up to 95 years imprisonment for me in these 12 [ cases ] , " he said			0
the charges against @entity14 range from violating secrecy to influencing judicial processes			0
media watchdog organizations warn growing numbers of @entity0 journalists now face not only the threat of lawsuits and fines for their work , but also possible jail sentences			1
according to the @entity26 , as of september 30 , 50 press workers were incarcerated in @entity0 prisons and at least 50 more were facing possible jail sentences			1
the climate of intimidation led the @entity30 to accuse @entity0 of not sufficiently guaranteeing freedom of expression			2
" concerns remain as regards political attacks against the press , " the @entity30 announced tuesday , in its annual progress report on @entity0 's bid to become the first predominantly @entity36 country to join the @entity37			1
the @entity42 report comes on the heels of a decision by the association @entity45 to downgrade @entity0 's rating on a press freedoms index			1
in two years , @entity0 has dropped from 102 to 138 on the association 's index , and now sits among the bottom 40 countries of the world when it comes to @entity53			1
" these declines can be explained , " @entity45 wrote , " by the frenzied proliferation of lawsuits , incarcerations , and court sentencing targeting journalists			2
" at a speech in @entity62 on monday , @entity0 president @entity60 conceded his country faced shortcomings when it comes to @entity53			1
" there are unfortunately certain cases that have been brought before the courts about journalists and it is a cause of concern for us as well , " @entity60 said			2
" there are certain legal amendments that will be introduced on this subject			0
" @entity60 's @entity76 , or @entity76 , has instituted historic reforms since it first swept to power in 2002			0
strict taboos imposed by the once politically - dominant @entity0 military have been relaxed			2
" the taboos have changed			0
the military is not taboo anymore , " said @entity82 , a veteran journalist who was black - listed and lost his job for his critical reporting on the military - dominated regime			0
but as power has shifted over the past decade from military to civilian rule , the @entity76 government has introduced laws that make it easier to prosecute journalists			0
a 2005 change to the @entity0 penal code established prison sentences for press - related crimes such as " breach of secrecy " and " influencing of a fair trial			1
" the journalistic red lines are now much harder to discern , said @entity82 -- who anchors the prime - time evening news on @entity0 's @entity104 " we knew what the military censorship was , " @entity82 said			1
" the problem with civilian government -- you do n't know			0
... it 's very , very unpredictable now			0
" last year , the @entity0 government slapped @entity82 's employer , @entity113 , with a $ 2.5 billion fine for unpaid taxes			1
at the time the assets of @entity117 , @entity0 's largest media conglomerate ( and a business partner of @entity2 's parent company @entity119 ) , was valued at $ 2.8 billion			1
tuesday 's @entity30 assessment report argued the penalty against @entity117 amounted to a political attack against the press			1
throughout @entity117 's subsequent battle over tax evasion charges , several journalists working for the conglomerate -- speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs -- told @entity2 they routinely self - censor reports to avoid arousing further anger from the government			2
but journalists said they are also frequently targeted by court cases launched by the political opposition			0
investigative journalist @entity3 said roughly half the cases he faces stem from articles critical of the @entity76 government , while the other half come from articles critical of @entity0 's older secular establishment			1
" in a country like @entity0 , where political polarization is widening between traditional power - holders from the military and @entity151 on the one hand and conservative liberals on the other , ... we journalists become the ones who take the first bullet , " he said			1

three years later , he has not been convicted			0
in the meantime , newspaper columnist @entity165 has been fighting in court after publishing a book accusing @entity0 police of not doing enough to stop @entity158 's murder			1
at one point , @entity165 faced a possible 32 years in prison -- a stiffer penalty than the one potentially faced by the alleged murderer			0
last summer , a court acquitted @entity165			0
several police officers named in his book are trying to appeal the decision , he said			0
