@entity0 may want to prepare for a deluge of attention from the literary set			1
her debut novel , " @entity5 , " just topped @entity7 's list of the 100 best books of the year			1
" we loved it , " said @entity7 editorial director @entity9			1
" this book is a gem			0
it 's beautifully written , it 's pitch - perfect			1
... it 's a bit of a sleeper , but a beautiful one			2
" " @entity5 , " which was released in late june , concerns an @entity19 - @entity18 family in @entity20			1
their star student daughter @entity21 has just died , found in the bottom of a nearby lake , and the family is torn apart trying to figure out what happened			0
in a rave review , the @entity26 praised the book 's freshness			2
" if we know this story , we have n't seen it yet in @entity18 fiction , not until now , " wrote @entity30			0
there are a number of well - known authors on @entity7 's list -- @entity38 's newest , " revival , " came in at no. 6 , and @entity41 's long - awaited " @entity40 " was no. 14 -- but @entity42 recognizes that singling out @entity0 could make her book a best - seller as well			1
" it 's thrilling to see that picking a book like this can actually make a difference , that people now will know about it who did not know about it before , " @entity42 said			2
the selection was made by six people on @entity7 's editorial team who lobbied one another furiously but tried not to let outside forces -- including reviews from major literary publications -- influence their choices , @entity42 said			1
the site picks best books monthly , so with those winners , as well as others on their radar , the group started with about 150 choices			2
@entity42 added that business politics are also kept away from the process			2
@entity7 has been involved in a months - long dispute with @entity69 , a major publishing firm that owns such imprints as @entity72 and @entity73			1
" no one has said anything to me , ever , about choosing by publisher , even amidst this @entity69 business , " @entity42 said			0
" nobody called me up and said , ' you 're in trouble , you put @entity69 's books on this list			1
' " she added that she keeps an open mind			0
there are a number of titles on the list , including " @entity40 , " @entity90 's " @entity89 " and @entity92 's " @entity91 , " that have earned their share of brickbats from critics			1
some choices are unanimous , @entity42 said , and others benefit from some strong votes			0
" a lot of this job is being able to evangelize for the books that you love			0
i 've had people on my team that love something that i 'm so - so on , and sometimes they speak about it so passionately that it makes me go back and read the book , " she says			0
" and sometimes i agree with them and sometimes i still do n't agree with them			0
" it 's a democracy , " she chuckles , " but i sort of guide a little bit			0

@entity0 's " @entity5 " tops @entity7 's 2014 best books list
other titles include @entity38 's " revival , " @entity41 's " @entity40 "
@entity7 's @entity9 : we try to keep business out of it
