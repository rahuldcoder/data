the news that a @entity2 woman has contracted the ebola virus has raised questions about what went wrong in the treatment of two patients evacuated from @entity8 to @entity9 , allowing the potentially deadly disease to spread from person - to - person outside @entity8 for the first time in this outbreak			1
how did the patient contract @entity14 ? the woman is a nursing assistant at the @entity15 in @entity9 ; it is thought she was exposed to the virus while trying to help one of the two @entity2 people flown there for treatment after they contracted @entity14 in @entity8			1
@entity2 health authorities insist all health protocols and procedures were followed in the care of missionaries @entity25 , who became sick while working in @entity27 , and @entity28 , who was taken ill in @entity29			1
both men eventually died of the disease			0
an investigation is under way into how the woman , who is in her 40s and married , was infected			0
it is thought there was no obvious problem , such as a torn glove , which would have raised the alarm ; concerns only emerged when she became ill on september 30 , four days after the death of the second patient			2
dr. @entity45 , from the @entity46 at @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , said the woman 's infection was likely due to " gaps in the safety protocol , the infection control precautions " at the hospital			1
" healthcare workers are at really great risk when they take care of patients with @entity14 , and we anticipate that from time to time there may be one or perhaps even a few cases of transmission from patients with @entity14 , during healthcare , to their healthcare providers , " @entity45 told @entity56			1
however , some @entity2 unions are blaming the government , saying they warned that personal protective equipment used by the medical team did not meet the highest standard ; authorities say proper procedures were followed			1
epidemiologist professor @entity75 , who worked on the world 's first @entity14 outbreak and now heads @entity78 , said the precise cause of the infection may never be known			1
" the barrier was let down somehow , " he said			0
" it could be something as simple as a defect in a rubber glove , or a momentary lapse , or it could be something major that the nurse does not want to report			0
these things do happen ; it 's not clear and may never be			0
" how can hospitals protect medical staff from @entity14 ? the ebola virus is transmitted by contact with the body fluids of an infected person , so hospitals must take steps to ensure their workers are protected from them			1
" there are protocols that if you follow carefully , you diminish greatly the likelihood that you 're going to get infected , " explained immunologist dr. @entity99 , of the @entity101 @entity100			2
the @entity101 @entity106 ( @entity106 ) recommend that medical personnel treating those with @entity14 wear protective clothing including gloves , an impermeable gown and eye protection			1
it says extra precautions should be taken when the patient 's condition means they are likely to come into contact with " copious amounts of blood , body fluids , vomit or feces			0
" @entity99 says that to keep medical staff safe " it 's more than just goggles and gloves			2
it 's a hood , it 's a gown , it 's a rubber apron , it 's coverings for your shoes			0
it 's everything that can keep a splash of body fluid away from you			0
" and he says that as well as having the right equipment , workers must know how to use it effectively , and to dispose of it properly			0
" it 's important to wear it , but it 's important also that when you take it off , you take it off properly , " he insists			0
" it is conceivable that you could be protected while you 're doing everything you need to do with the patient and then as you remove the protective material that could be a point of vulnerability			0
" is the hospital equipped to handle @entity14 cases ? the medical facility where the nurse 's assistant worked , @entity9 's @entity154 , is a specialist hospital for infectious diseases			1
in addition to @entity2 , patients suffering from @entity14 have been evacuated to @entity159 ( two ) , @entity160 ( one ) , the @entity161 ( one ) and @entity162 ( one ) ; this is the first time a medical worker treating one of them has been infected			1
" the hospitals where the patients are being taken are supposed to be equipped and ready to deal with @entity14 patients , " @entity168 spokesman @entity167 told @entity56			2
all members of the medical team which treated @entity25 are now under observation , as are the woman 's husband and the ambulance crew which took her to hospital			2

" we were kind of expecting this , " said @entity191 , a nursing assistant at @entity9 's @entity192			1
" at least i was expecting it , because this is not a game to be played in the way that they 've done it			0
it 's a very worrying matter , and they have not handled it correctly			0
" some argue that the two missionaries were so ill they should not have been brought to @entity2 for treatment , exposing many others to the disease			1
but experts insist the risk of an @entity14 outbreak outside @entity8 are still very slim			1
" if protocols are being followed , it 's highly unlikely that an outbreak could happen in the @entity213 , " said @entity167			0
" but zero risk does n't exist , particularly in a hospital where staff are dealing with sick people			2
" we need to find out as soon as possible what happened and if we need to revise procedures			0

" if you 're running a hospital or if you 're a public health administrator in a big city , you should definitely be concerned by this , " said dr. @entity236 of @entity237 in @entity238			0
" this should be a disease you can prevent by really rigorously adhering to protocols , and what we 're seeing [ with this case ] is that even if teams notionally know what they 're doing -- there 's a protocol in the drawer , they 've ordered the right kind of suits - that people have to be really well - versed in putting them on , in taking them off , in practicing			2
" this is about drill , practice and preparedness , " he said			0
" every hospital everywhere needs to be aware that this could come to them , " insisted professor @entity75			2
" they need protocols in place , and they need to be ready to deal with it			0
