@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity3 went to the @entity4 in @entity5 in the heart of @entity1 's @entity7 , where a spectacular musical version of " @entity9 " is enjoying a successful run , to meet @entity12 composer @entity11 , whose blend of @entity15 culture with rock and @entity18 classical styles has revolutionized the @entity12 film industry			1
and now @entity11 is about to make his mark in @entity21			1
@entity11 , interviewed by @entity2 's @entity3 virtually unknown in @entity22 and the @entity23 , @entity11 has sold 200 million albums worldwide -- more than the @entity25 -- and is worshipped throughout much of @entity15 , where he 's known as the @entity26			1
now he has added a @entity21 film score to his vast repertoire of movie music			1
@entity11 explained to @entity2 what he thinks makes great movie music			1
" a great soundtrack is like ' @entity33 " s theme ' , the ' @entity36 ' theme , ' @entity37 ' and all those sorts of things , where it stood by itself , " he said			0
but recently , he 's noticed a changing mood			2
" now it is becoming too abstract and more ambient and more ... i do n't know , soundscape - ish , more than melody			0
people are afraid of melody : ' oh , that melody is distracting my scene , ' it is becoming like that			0
" and that brings fresh challenges for the makers of film music			1
" now the challenges of the composer are much more , " he told @entity2			2
" one needs to know of recording , production , it is not enough to compose a great theme and [ know ] how it can intertwine with the movie			2
and with @entity12 film it is an even greater challenge , because we need to be like @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and an @entity12 folk composer all put together			1
so they expect finesse and they expect versatility			0
" @entity11 's compositions are versatile enough to be used by both @entity77 and @entity21 , a case in point being his music for the @entity77 film " @entity84 , " which was used almost a decade later by @entity82 for " @entity83			1
" but for @entity11 , the process to create film music is being challenged by increasingly crammed movie schedules			1
" there used to be a time where the director and the composer would work together , " he explained			1
" they would develop themes and the director would shoot a scene , but now the world 's so fast that people are finishing the movie even before going to a composer			1
" as well as writing songs and scores , @entity11 has featured in many @entity77 films singing the songs which are mimed by the acting superstars			2
he recently completed a sell - out tour of the @entity23 performing highlights from his songbook to devoted fans			0
he explained to @entity2 how playback singing is a normal part of @entity12 film music			1
" well , until i worked in ' @entity112 ' six or seven years back , i never realized that it is not cool to have playback singing			0
until then , it was the story of @entity12 films where somebody else lip synchs and somebody else sings			2
" and @entity11 has been converted to the @entity18 model , where those singing on - screen usually provide the vocals themselves			2
" in my future projects i would rather have a star who sings , " he said			0
director @entity127 recruited @entity11 and fellow composer @entity128 to provide the score for @entity131 's sequel to " @entity132 , " " the @entity133 , " which premieres at @entity134 in september this year			1
@entity127 described the thrill of working with two such different -- and complementary -- composers			0
he told @entity2 , " here are two totally different cultures			0
@entity128 is strings and heart , the skies , choir , angels and devils , and @entity145 r. is modern , restless music			0
" " just to get them together was very interesting for me			0
to sit there and see both of them jamming together , that was fascinating			0
they would n't talk , they would jam , and out of the jamming came the music			0
" @entity11 is still getting used to his new - found status as darling of both @entity159 -- and it leads to a somewhat chaotic lifestyle , as he explained			2
" it is terrifying sometimes			0
i suddenly wake up in @entity163 doing music for ' @entity133 , ' and suddenly wake up doing an @entity12 superstar film , but i think after all these years i am probably getting a balance			1
