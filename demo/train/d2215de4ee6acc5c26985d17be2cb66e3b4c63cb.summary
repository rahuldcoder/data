-- a @entity3 man fatally stabbed three people , slashed at least five others , hit and killed one man with a car and hijacked two vehicles before being wrestled to the ground early saturday while trying to break into the cab of a subway car , police said			1
@entity12 , who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist , was arrested aboard a northbound train in @entity16 around 9 a.m. saturday , about 28 hours after he allegedly began a spree that spanned three @entity3 boroughs , police commissioner @entity19 said			1
" it 's so horrendous and bizarre , " @entity19 told reporters saturday afternoon			0
" we have no reason that we can give you as to why he did this			0
" around 5 a.m. friday , police say @entity12 , 23 , got into a dispute with his mother at her home in the @entity31 section of @entity32			1
she had refused to let him take her 2004 gray @entity35			0
the suspect 's stepfather intervened and was stabbed 11 times , according to @entity19			1
the stepfather -- @entity40 , 54 -- died , while the mother alerted authorities after surviving unscathed			1
police believe @entity12 , having then taken the @entity35 , fatally stabbed the mother of his ex-girlfriend 11 times in her @entity32 home around 10:30 a.m. the victim , 56 - year - old @entity47 , lived there -- which was about a mile north of the earlier stabbing -- with her daughter			1
around 4:15 p.m. , @entity12 's former girlfriend returned home , found her mother dead on the floor and called 911 three times , police said			1
commissioner @entity19 said all the calls , the last of which came in around 4:18 p.m. , were brief and that authorities had arrived on the scene around 4:20 p.m. in that short period , @entity12 -- presumably lurking somewhere in the apartment -- went after 20 - year - old @entity62 with a knife , @entity19 said			2
likely stabbing her first inside , the suspect allegedly chased his former girlfriend into the street and -- after kniving the jacket sleeve of a passerby trying to stop him -- killed her			2
" there 's no indication on the ( 911 ) tapes that she was aware of him being present , " @entity19 said			0
" ( it seemed ) a tremendously traumatic experience for her			0
" @entity12 hopped back into his @entity35 , and rear - ended a 1995 @entity79 , according to police			1
he stabbed that car 's driver -- a 60 - year - old man whom @entity12 did not know -- in the shoulder and neck in a confrontation , ditched his @entity35 and left the scene in the @entity79			1
police said they later found four kitchen knives inside the @entity35			0
as of saturday afternoon , the @entity79 's original driver was in stable condition at a local hospital recovering from three stab wounds to the chest , according to the commissioner			0

the man , later identified as 60 - year - old @entity99 , died of his injuries			0
the suspect eventually abandoned the @entity79 , which was found in @entity32 near a railroad line that @entity12 was known to frequent as a graffiti artist			2
shortly before 1 a.m. saturday , according to @entity19 , @entity12 hopped into a cab in @entity32 and stabbed its driver			1
that man is also in stable condition at a local hospital			0
the commissioner said @entity12 then got out of the cab and confronted a couple , stabbing a 25 - year - old man in the hands and taking his keys to a @entity114			2
that man , who @entity19 said suffered only defensive wounds , was treated and released at a hospital			0
the @entity114 was later found in the @entity3 borough of @entity119 , not far from a subway station			1
around 8:30 a.m. saturday , @entity3 police got a phone tip that @entity12 might have been riding on a southbound subway train in @entity16			1
another witness , who approached police at a subway stop , said @entity12 knocked from her hands a newspaper that featured his picture and alleged exploits and said to her , " do you believe what they 're writing about me ? " @entity12 crossed the tracks at a midtown @entity16 stop and jumped onto a northbound express train			1
the suspect stabbed another passenger -- a 40 - year - old man , whom @entity12 did n't appear to know -- in the head and neck sometime during his time onboard , @entity19 said			1
that male subway passenger is also in stable condition			0
eventually , the suspect worked his way to the front cab of the train			0
the commissioner said @entity12 pounded on the cab 's door , yelling " police " -- apparently trying to get in , by claiming he was a police officer			1
he did not appear to know two transit police officers , later identified as @entity152 and @entity153 , were inside the cab with the train 's operator			2
soon after , the officers -- with aid from off - duty @entity3 police @entity159			1
@entity162 and an unnamed civilian nearby -- wrestled @entity12 to the ground			2
no one was hurt in that scuffle , during which a knife fell to the ground			0
police also found @entity12 had another , smaller , knife when they detained him			1
he also had what @entity19 described as a " significant amount of money			0
" " this was a tremendous effort , " @entity19 said , referring to the various law enforcement units and tools used to look for @entity12			2
@entity19 said the suspect was mostly " incoherent " after being arrested , besides a statement that " she had to die			0
" the commissioner said he did not know if " she " referred to @entity62 , her mother or someone else			0
as of saturday afternoon , @entity12 had not yet been charged with any crime and was in a @entity16 police precinct			1
@entity19 said @entity12 had 10 previous arrests , mostly for drug charges and graffiti , plus one robbery charge			2
