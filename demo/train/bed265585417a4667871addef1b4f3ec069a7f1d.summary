@entity2 's remarkable @entity1 scoring streak came to an end on sunday as @entity4 celebrated reclaiming the @entity6 title with a less than convincing 2 - 1 win at @entity8			1
@entity2 started his first domestic match since the end of march , but was taken off in the 68th minute having apparently failed to recover from the injury problems that have dogged the latter part of his season			2
it meant his run of having scored in 21 successive league matches came to a halt , but @entity4 did recover from 1 - 0 down when he left the pitch despite needing to complete the match with only 10 men having made all possible replacements			1
the victory that leaves the @entity25 on course to match @entity28 's points record from last season			0
having clinched a fourth title in five seasons when second - placed @entity28 could only draw with @entity32 on saturday , @entity4 went behind five minutes after halftime in the @entity6 capital			1
@entity35 dispossessed @entity36 and fed the ball to striker @entity38 , who netted his 28th goal this season to stay third in the " pichichi " scoring stakes behind @entity2 ( 46 ) and @entity43 ( 34 )			2
@entity44 leveled the score five minutes after @entity2 departed , toe - poking in a low shot after combining well with @entity47 for his 10th in @entity1			2
the @entity48 was then booked after taking off his shirt to reveal a @entity51 message			0
@entity4 's winner came with 10 minutes to play , and was equally unrepresentative of the elegant play usually associated with the club			2
striker @entity55 scuffed a shot which deflected off @entity57 and -- apparently going wide of the goal -- then hit @entity35 before bobbling into @entity60 ' net			0
ugly as it was , it means @entity4 can equal @entity28 's tally of 100 points by winning the last three games			1
@entity8 stayed third after the defeat , but can still win a trophy this season by beating city rivals real in next friday 's @entity71 final			1
@entity72 climbed into the fourth @entity74 place with a 4 - 0 win at midtable @entity76 , moving a point above @entity78 -- who host @entity80 on monday			1
sixth - placed @entity81 drew 0 - 0 with @entity82 , while seventh - placed @entity83 won 1 - 0 at home to second - bottom @entity85 , with @entity86 scoring the second - half winner			1
@entity88 @entity89 clinched a first @entity91 title since 1994 after winning 1 - 0 at third - placed @entity92 on sunday			1
midfielder @entity93 scored the only goal in the 53rd minute to put big - spending @entity89 seven points clear of @entity96 with two matches to play			1
it gave coach @entity99 a league title in three countries , having previously won in @entity102 with @entity103 and in @entity104 with @entity105 , while star striker @entity106 celebrated a championship in his fifth different nation			0
january signing @entity109 came on for a brief cameo in time added on , and is now the first @entity104 player to be involved in title - winning teams in four countries			1
it also represented the first trophy for @entity89 's @entity120 owners , who have spent a reported $ 320 million on players since taking a controlling share in 2011			2
" we fulfilled our objectives of winning the @entity91 title and going a long way in the @entity74 , " said @entity99 , whose team reached the quarterfinals of @entity126 's top club competition before losing to @entity4 on away goals			2
" the squad has worked very hard and were always very professional			0
" the club 's president @entity132 added : " i am delighted to have won this title after two very tough years			0
we deserve to win this trophy			0
we were happy that @entity96 won yesterday , because we wanted to win the league with a victory in this match			0
" it 's a magnificent moment for the club and our supporters			0
i am so proud of our fans who have been right behind us through thick and thin			0
they deserve this title too after 19 years			0

@entity4 star @entity2 unable to continue his 21 - game domestic scoring run
four - time world player of year goes off during 2 - 1 win over @entity8
@entity89 win @entity88 title for the first time since 1994
sunday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity92 puts @entity89 seven points clear with two games left
