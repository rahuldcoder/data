-- the tragic murder of cpl. @entity2 by @entity3 -- " a recent convert to @entity4 " as every media outlet in the @entity6 would like to remind you -- has added fuel to the already fiery debate in this country over the inherently violent nature of religion in general , and @entity4 in particular			1
it seems that , in the minds of many , the only possible reason a @entity15 convert would go on a shooting spree in the @entity19 @entity18 is because his religious beliefs commanded him to do so			2
of course , it could very well be the case that @entity3 was motivated by his @entity4 beliefs			1
it could be that he read a particular passage in the @entity26 , understood it to mean he should kill as many @entity19 government officials as possible , and then went out and did just that			2
after all , there 's no question that a person 's religious beliefs can and often do influence his or her behavior			2
the mistake lies in assuming there is a necessary and distinct causal connection between belief and behavior -- that @entity3 's actions were exclusively the result of his religious beliefs			1
the notion that there is a one - to - one correlation between religious beliefs and behavior may seem obvious and self - evident to those unfamiliar with the study of religion			0
but it has been repeatedly debunked by social scientists who note that " beliefs do not causally explain behavior " and that behavior is in fact the result of complex interplay among a host of social , political , cultural , ethical , emotional , and yes , religious factors			0
in the case of @entity3 , his violent behavior could have been influenced as much by his religious beliefs as by his documented mental problems , his extensive criminal past or his history of drug addiction			0
yet , because @entity3 was a muslim , it is simply assumed that the sole motivating factor for his abhorrent behavior was his religious beliefs			1
indeed , there 's even a term for this idea : @entity74 -- an imaginary contagion invented by the neo-conservative commentator @entity76 to describe how any normal - seeming @entity15 can suddenly snap for no reason at all and go on a murderous rampage ( thus proving @entity76 ' point that " all @entity15 must be considered potential terrorists " )			0
strangely , this causal connection between belief and behavior seems not to be as aggressively applied if the criminal in question claims a different religion than @entity4			1
take the example of the @entity89 terrorist @entity88 , who slaughtered 77 people , the majority of them children , in 2011			1
@entity88 explicitly defined himself as a @entity94 warrior fighting what he called an " existential conflict " with @entity4			1
nevertheless , a great deal of the media coverage surrounding his actions seemed to take for granted that his crime had nothing to do with his @entity94 identity -- that it was based instead on his right - wing ideology , or his anti-immigrant views , or his neglectful upbringing , or even , as @entity107 famously argued , because his view that " @entity109 will be overrun by @entity4 " was being censored by a politically correct media , leaving him " no other choice but to use violence			1
" all of the above explanations for @entity88 's behavior , including his religious beliefs , are pertinent in understanding the motivations for his behavior			0
but to argue that @entity88 's or @entity3 's actions were motivated solely by their religious beliefs -- or that their religious beliefs necessarily dictated their actions -- is simply irrational			1
and yet , this trope has become exceedingly common among some critics of religion			0
take the following excerpt from the bestselling book " @entity140 , " by the anti-theist activist @entity128 ( note : because @entity128 has repeatedly tried to defuse the significance of his argument and has even gone so far as to accuse those , including me , who quote his words of defamation , i will present the passage in its entirety so that there can be no confusion as to his meaning )			0
" the link between belief and behavior raises the stakes considerably			1
some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them			1
this may seem an extraordinary claim , but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the world in which we live			0
certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion , while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others			0
there is , in fact , no talking to some people			1
if they can not be captured , and they often can not , otherwise tolerant people may be justified in killing them in self - defense			2
" @entity128 ' argument is that a person 's religious beliefs do not merely influence his or her behavior			0
in other words , people holding certain beliefs should be killed , not because those beliefs may lead to violent behavior , but because they necessarily will			2
therefore , in order to save ourselves ( " self - defense " @entity128 calls it ) we may be justified in killing the believer before his or her beliefs turn into action -- as they inevitably will			0
it is true that religious beliefs can often lead to actions that violate basic human rights			0
it is also true that a great many of those actions are taking place right now among @entity15			0
but it is ridiculous to claim that the actions of @entity4 extremists are either necessarily or exclusively the result of their belief in @entity4			1
there may be millions of @entity15 who share the ultra-orthodox , puritanical strain of @entity4 -- called @entity203 -- that fuels the members of @entity206			1
but the @entity6 is not at war with @entity203 ( if it were we would have bombed @entity209 long ago )			0
it is at war with @entity206 , and not because of what they believe , but because of the actions they have carried out based on their interpretation of those beliefs			0
arguing otherwise leads to the preposterous conclusion that anyone who shares any measure of religious beliefs with a violent extremist is equally guilty for that extremist 's violent actions -- regardless of how diverse the interpretations of those beliefs may be			0
in fact , @entity128 makes this exact point : " given the link between belief and action , it is clear that we can no more tolerate a diversity of religious beliefs than a diversity of beliefs about epidemiology and basic hygiene			2
" the danger of this mistaken view of " the link between belief and action " is that it makes it that much more difficult to counter religious violence			2
when we condemn an entire community of faith for sharing certain beliefs with extremists in their community , we end up alienating the very people who are best positioned to counter such extremism in the first place			1
people should be free to believe whatever they want to believe , no matter how irrational those beliefs may appear to us -- just as people should be free to criticize those beliefs			2
it is when such beliefs lead to violent behavior that people of all faiths -- as well as those of no faith -- should unite in condemnation			1
join us on @entity267 / @entity266 .			0

role of @entity4 was *discussed* after the shootings in @entity271
@entity273 says simply having a certain belief does *n't* cause one to engage in terrorism
he says the real issue should be how people act , not what faith they hold
