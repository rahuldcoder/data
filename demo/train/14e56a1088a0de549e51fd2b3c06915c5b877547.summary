-- the ebola virus has killed 10 people in the @entity4 , the @entity1 said tuesday			1
as of monday , @entity1 said , the deaths are among 13 probable and two confirmed @entity7 cases reported in @entity8 in eastern @entity4			1
the @entity4 @entity9 has set up a task force to deal with the outbreak and is working with @entity1 , @entity12 , @entity13 and the @entity14			1
twelve cases and eight deaths occurred in the area of @entity18 , a town in @entity4 's north , @entity1 said			1
the fatalities included three health care workers			0
one death each occurred in @entity4 's @entity25 and @entity26 regions			2
prisoner with suspected case of @entity7 escapes from hospital in @entity30 @entity4 's @entity8 province borders western @entity30 , where 24 probable and confirmed cases , including 16 deaths , have been reported since the beginning of july			1
but @entity1 spokesman @entity35 told @entity0 that there 's no connection between the outbreaks in @entity30 and @entity4			1
the viruses , he said , are two different @entity7 strains			0
there are five strains of the virus , a highly infectious and often fatal agent spread through direct contact with bodily fluids and , @entity35 said , it is extremely difficult to travel between @entity18 , for example , and @entity49 , the western @entity30 district where an outbreak emerged last month			1
that 's because it is heavily forested with impassable roads , and the only viable way to travel is going 10 to 15 kilometers per hour via motorbike			0
so it is unlikely there would be contact between @entity30 and @entity4 that would lead to infection			2
could the @entity7 outbreak spread to the @entity62 ? the natural habitat of the ebola virus is in the @entity66 forest belt region , @entity35 said			1
it 's " either by chance " or from " more surveying " for the disease , he said , that " we see these two outbreaks concurrently			0
" health agencies have embarked on an aggressive approach in @entity30 to deal with the cases			2
who has asked countries bordering @entity30 to " enhance surveillance " for the virus			0
the last confirmed case in @entity30 was admitted to an isolation facility on august 4 , @entity1 said			2
the virus was first detected in 1976 in @entity4 , when the country was known as @entity4			0
symptoms can include fever , vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal pain , headache , a measles - like rash , red eyes and , at times , bleeding from body openings			0
