-- holders @entity1 remain on course to become the first side to retain the @entity4 , as two goals in the first 11 minutes saw them defeat @entity6 3 - 1 for a 4 - 1 aggregate victory and a place in the final against either @entity10 or @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity13 celebrates scoring @entity1 's second goal as they reached the @entity4 final			1
a carnival atmosphere at the @entity17 saw the home fans optimistic that last week 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity20 could be overturned , but those hopes were cruelly dashed as two individual mistakes allowed @entity1 to take a foothold in the game -- a position they never looked likely to relinquish			1
@entity6 went into the match unbeaten in their last 27 home matches in @entity29 , since @entity10 defeated them 2 - 1 at @entity30 in 2004 , and had yet to taste @entity32 defeat at the @entity17 , but that proud record always looked in doubt from the moment @entity1 took an eighth - minute lead			1
@entity13 played a dangerous ball from the left into the @entity6 penalty area and young @entity37 left - back @entity38 , who has deputized superbly for @entity41 international @entity40 in recent weeks , lost his footing -- allowing @entity43 to collect the ball and fire past goalkeeper @entity46			1
the goal , the first @entity6 had conceded at home in @entity29 this season , justified manager @entity51 's decision to select @entity52 ahead of @entity53 in the only change to the @entity1 side from last week 's victory at @entity20			0
@entity52 's strike meant @entity6 now had to score three to reach the final , but their task was made even harder just three minutes later when @entity13 's 40 - yard free - kick deceived @entity46 , who had kept @entity6 in contention in the first leg with a string of fine saves			1
despite the ferocity and brilliance of @entity13 's long - range strike , @entity46 appeared to misjudge the flight of the ball as it nestled into the left - hand corner of the net			0
the second goal effectively killed off the contest , with 79 minutes remaining , and @entity6 were fortunate not to go three goals down on the night in the 17th minute when @entity46 dived full - stretch to tip @entity78 's superb curling effort around the post			1
the half - time interval gave @entity6 some respite , but @entity1 looked far from finished as an attacking threat and could have extended their lead six minutes after the break when @entity13 twisted and turned the @entity6 defense before firing a fierce shot that @entity46 did well to turn around the post			1
@entity6 pressed forward in search of a goal that would have given them some hope , but left themselves open to a @entity1 counter-attack and in the 61st minute the visitors added a devastating third			0
an @entity6 corner was cleared and the ball found its way to the @entity52 , who found @entity78 on the left			0
the @entity100 striker looked up before picking out @entity13 who had burst into the box , and the @entity103 winger clinically despatched his finish into the top corner of the @entity6 net			2
with the match over as a contest , @entity6 were now just playing for pride			0
@entity111 's long - range shot stung the hands of fellow - @entity114 @entity113 in the @entity1 goal , while substitute @entity116 fired into the side - netting after a promising run			0
however , there was a late sting in the tail for @entity1 when midfielder @entity122 tackled @entity123 in the penalty area			2
the @entity125 appeared to take the ball but @entity128 referee @entity127 stunned @entity1 by pointing to the penalty spot before sending off @entity122 , meaning he will now miss the final			2
@entity111 stepped up to convert the penalty , but it was scant consolation for a well - beaten @entity6 side , as @entity1 moved to within 90 minutes of winning a fourth @entity4 and a possible showdown against @entity136 rivals @entity10 in a repeat of last year 's epic final in the @entity140 rain			1
" we got the lucky break by scoring the first goal , " a delighted @entity51 told @entity141			0
" however , after that , i though our performance was terrific			0
" it 's just such a shame that @entity122 will miss the final			0
he clearly took the ball and mr @entity127 is one of the best referees in @entity29 , but he got that one wrong and unfortunately there is no appeal procedure			0
" talking about the final , @entity51 added : " @entity11 's display against @entity156 on saturday had me drooling with admiration , but @entity11 have defensive problems and i just think @entity10 might be too strong for them on the night			2

@entity1 reach the @entity4 final in @entity12 after defeating @entity6
the defending champions win 3 - 0 at the @entity17 for a 4 - 0 aggregate *success*
@entity43 and @entity13 kill the game with two goals in 11 minutes
@entity1 finish game with 10 men after @entity122 unluckily sent off late on
@entity1 will face either @entity10 once again or @entity11 in the final on may 29
