@entity0 , @entity1 -- the regime of ousted leader @entity5 and the rebel government -- the @entity4 -- have both committed war crimes during the conflict in @entity1 and someone needs to take control to stop abuses from continuing , @entity3 said in a report released tuesday			1
the 112 - page report detailed many examples of abuses by the @entity5 loyalists , which included " mass killing of prisoners , torture , enforced disappearances , and arbitrary arrests			1
" the report also spotlighted what @entity3 called a problem with the @entity4 in controlling divergent groups of @entity28 fighters			1
a researcher on @entity1 for @entity3 , @entity30 , told @entity2 she had overheard screams of pain and the sounds of whipping on a recent visit to a @entity1 detention center			1
" it is the responsibility of the @entity39 to investigate these crimes , " she said			0
" we have called on them as @entity3 to put the judicial processes in place and to make sure that they get a grip on the various armed groups that are currently conducting arrests outside the framework of the law			2
" the report said rebel fighters have conducted revenge attacks on prisoners and , at one point , conducted house - to - house raids killing people they thought were @entity5 mercenaries			1
" the @entity4 is facing a difficult task of reining in opposition fighters and vigilante groups responsible for serious human rights abuses , including possible war crimes ; but has shown unwillingness to hold them accountable , " the report says			1
" so far , @entity4 officials have not provided details of any measures taken to address such concerns			2
" @entity5 officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the report			1
the @entity4 released a statement about the report tuesday			1
" the @entity3 report is overwhelmingly filled with the horrific abuses and killings by the @entity5 regime , however there are a small number of incidents involving those opposed to @entity5 , the @entity4 strongly condemns any abuses perpetrated by either side , " the statement said			1
" the @entity4 is firmly committed to upholding human rights and the rule of law , both international and local , the violation of rights no longer has a place in @entity1			2
" @entity3 said it was up to the @entity4 to fix these issues			1
" it is a war crime for any party to a conflict to kill prisoners , " @entity3 said			1
" the onus now is on the @entity4 to do things differently , end abuses and initiate the human rights reforms that are urgently needed			2
" @entity30 said an @entity3 team had visited about eight detention centers in western @entity1 , including in @entity0 and @entity102 , where about 2,300 prisoners were held			2
" many of them told us that they were beaten , some were tortured , " @entity30 said			0
" in fact , when i was in one of these detention centers i could overhear prisoners screaming in pain and i could overhear the sounds of whipping -- and this was when an @entity3 delegate is inside the facility			1
you can imagine what takes place outside this oversight			0
" the @entity3 report comes a day after the country 's interim leader gave a speech from @entity0 and promised to rebuild @entity1 's institutions and justice system			2
" we aim to establish a state of law , a state of welfare , a state where @entity132 @entity131 law is the main source of legislation , " said @entity128 , chairman of the @entity4			2
" this matter requires several things , primarily unity of classes and non division and the soul rejection of hatred and envy -- not taking law into your own hands			0
" @entity128 was justice minister under @entity5 before defecting to join the opposition in february			0
the head of the @entity4 spoke the same day @entity5 purportedly vowed to " kill until victory " in a message read by an anchor at the @entity153 - based television station @entity154			1
@entity154 , a privately owned station that has , in recent weeks , taken over for @entity1 state media in fulfilling a role as @entity5 's mouthpiece , had previously reported that it would air a message from the former leader			0
because of security concerns , the station decided to delay the broadcast of the video , the anchor said			0
instead , he read a statement that @entity154 attributed to @entity5			0
" @entity1 people have no option but to defeat the coup attempt against the revolution			0
we can not surrender our land to the @entity174 people so that they may enjoy it			0
and we can not become subjects after we were rulers in local committees and local meetings , " the statement said			0
" we can not surrender @entity1 to imperialism once again like the agents / spies want us to now			0
so we have no option but to kill until victory and to destroy this attempted overthrow			0
" @entity2 's @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
