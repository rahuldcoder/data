@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 announced a voluntary recall of 223,000 popular strollers following the death of an infant eight years ago and the near strangulation of another in 2006			1
the heads of the two infants became entangled between the tray and seat			1
but officials did n't link the cases to a specific brand and model of stroller until recently			0
the recall involves @entity21 and @entity22 strollers made by @entity23 , @entity24 in 2004 , a 6 - month - old @entity26 boy died after his head was trapped between his stroller 's seat and the tray			1
in the 2006 incident , a 7 - month - old @entity32 girl nearly died from similar circumstances			1
" entrapment and strangulation can occur , especially to infants younger than 12 months of age , when a child is not harnessed , " the @entity2 said			0
" an infant can pass through the opening between the stroller tray and seat bottom , but his / her head and neck can become entrapped by the tray			2
infants who become entrapped at the neck are at risk of strangulation			0
" manufactured between january 2004 and september 2007 , in a variety of colors , the strollers were sold nationwide at retail outlets , according to the @entity2			2

in 2008 , a voluntary industry standard went into place addressing the height of the opening between the stroller 's tray and the seat bottom			2
