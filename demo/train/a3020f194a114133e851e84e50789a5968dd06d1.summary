-- @entity1 may only have been founded 13 years ago but on wednesday it stood on the brink of the biggest result in its brief history			1
the @entity6 club , transformed by multi-millionaire businessman @entity7 , stood a mere 13 minutes away from a draw with @entity10 champions @entity9			1
in front of a packed @entity18 in the @entity6 capital of @entity20 , the @entity13 side 's superstars -- including @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 -- were on the verge of a major embarrassment			1
but @entity24 's side are n't @entity26 holders for nothing and @entity29 striker @entity28 got them out of jail in the nick of time with a goal that sealed a 2 - 1 win			1
football : @entity36 crazy for @entity37 ? the minnows had gone ahead , @entity39 converting from a corner after just 6 minutes to send an already excited crowd into raptures			2
just four minutes later @entity43 -- on loan from @entity46 club @entity45 -- won a penalty but @entity14 's effort was saved by @entity49			1
ironically , it was defender @entity51 who gave the @entity53 the chance to make amends 15 minutes later after bringing down the world player of the year inside the area			0
@entity51 had been @entity1 ' hero when it made the group stage , going in goal after its goalkeeper was sent off and saving two penalties against @entity63 's @entity62 in the playoff			1
but @entity51 could only watch on as @entity14 found the bottom corner to restore parity			0
ludogorets gave as good as it got in an open second half but just as it looked as if the match was destined for a draw , @entity28 finished neatly from a right wing cross			2
the other match in @entity73 saw @entity75 club @entity74 beaten 1 - 0 by @entity76 in @entity77			1
@entity78 scored the only goal of the game , pouncing on a loose ball inside the penalty area to slot into the roof of the net from close range			0
@entity87 wasted @entity74 's best chance while striker @entity89 was again kept quiet			0
captain @entity90 told @entity91 : " they wanted it more and we were second best against an ok team			0
we made it easy for them			0
we wanted at least a draw and i expected us to win so i 'm very disappointed			0
" @entity99 notched his first hat - trick in @entity102 colors as the @entity103 thumped @entity105 side @entity104 4 - 1 at @entity106 in @entity107			1
the striker , signed by @entity109 from @entity45 on transfer deadline day , struck first on 22 minutes after a through ball from another new recruit -- @entity113 , signed from @entity114			0
poor defending from the @entity105 allowed @entity99 to double his tally eight minutes later , as he raced onto a misplaced header from @entity118 and finished into the bottom corner			2
@entity120 ensured @entity102 went into the break leading by three as he cut inside and found the same corner @entity99 had moments earlier			2
and @entity124 forward @entity99 completed his first treble for his new club with a neat finish on 52 minutes , dinking the ball over @entity129 from @entity131 's pass			2
@entity102 were reduced to 10 men when goalkeeper @entity133 brought down @entity134 in the area , the striker slotting home from the spot after substitute @entity139 had come on			0
@entity140 told @entity91 of his first senior hat - trick : " the manager has shown a lot of faith in me and i 'm delighted to repay him			1
" i 'm playing up front in my favored position and i 'm going to do everything i can to help the team			0
" @entity109 , celebrating his 18th anniversary as @entity103 boss , added of the striker : " it was a great performance -- he has the instinct of a goalscorer and finished well the work of the team			0
" elsewhere , a double from @entity160 helped @entity162 outfit @entity161 to a 3 - 0 victory over @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity166 grabbing the other goal			1
a late goal from @entity169 sealed victory for @entity13 champions @entity171 over @entity172			1
it was the first goal the @entity175 champions had conceded this season			0
@entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 got the goals as @entity181 defeated @entity182 3 - 1 in @entity162			2
a double from @entity183 helped @entity184 to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity187 club @entity186 in @entity188 , while @entity191 side @entity189 and @entity192 drew 0 - 0 in @entity193 .			1

@entity9 *eke* out a narrow away win over @entity6 minnows @entity1
@entity28 scored the winner with 13 minutes left after @entity9 had gone behind
@entity99 grabs a hat - trick as @entity46 side @entity102 beat @entity104 4 - 1
@entity169 's late goal seals 1 - 0 win for @entity13 champions @entity171 over @entity172
