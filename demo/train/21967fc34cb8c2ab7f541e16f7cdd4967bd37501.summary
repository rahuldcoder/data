-- as she sat in the makeup chair , dressed in a plush terrycloth robe while two women did her nails and another did her makeup , @entity1 knew the day she had longed for had finally arrived			2
the 62 - year - old @entity7 has a long resume of disparate jobs : schoolteacher , performer , hostess and shop girl , to name a few			0
but in april , she finally added model for a high - fashion house to the list			1
" i felt like such a princess , a queen for a day , " @entity1 said			0
" i was as high as a kite			0
" for many , the life of a model is the stuff of dreams , an aspiration so far out of reach that we would never dare utter it to friends			0
but some fashion labels are putting the focus on women ( and men ) who are n't typical calendar girls			1
@entity1 is one of 11 " real people " selected to appear in @entity36 designer @entity35 's winter ad campaign , which is generating buzz for using people of all sizes , colors and ages to create intimate images that resemble portraits			1
it 's about bringing a sense of reality to fashion to show that the lofty world of high style is not as unattainable as it seems , said @entity50 , creative director of @entity35			1
" @entity52 does n't look good only on models , it can look good on different people of different ages and different body shapes , " he said			1
" we did n't think there would be such a big talk because we just did it and we thought let 's try to work with real people			1
let 's do street casting , let 's work with different men and women of different ages and see what comes out of it			1
" aging stylishly , online and in the streets none of them fit the typical model mold because they are n't professional models			1
casting agent @entity76 found @entity1 and 82 - year - old @entity77 through the popular street style blog @entity79 , which documents men and women of a certain age			1
others came from street scouting , including one of the older male models , who was spotted walking out of a basement bar in @entity7 's @entity88 , said @entity76 , whose agency scouted the models			2
while the @entity35 models are not professionals , they possess a certain mystique			1
" it 's beyond visual			0
sure , they might have great eyes or features but it 's more about their presence , their ownership of their own individuality , " @entity76 said			0
" you might see someone who has style , but if you strip away everything , are they still powerful ? because we are taking them out of who they are and putting them in new clothes			0
are they interesting beyond what they 're wearing ? " of course , pounding the pavement in search of raw talent is nothing new			0
but it 's becoming increasingly common as fashion and style slowly embrace different ideals of beauty			1
earlier this month , @entity126 revealed that the new face of its ad campaign would be 60 - year - old @entity129 , who was spotted in a @entity7 restaurant			1
in swimwear , @entity133 designer @entity131 © s chose an infant with @entity136 to be the face of the brand 's 2013 @entity139 ads. it would have been easy to create a beautiful photo with a beautiful model , said @entity50 , especially working with photographer @entity144 and some of the top names in hair and makeup			2
but , at this level , it 's important to think outside the box and move forward with each campaign , he said			0
" i 'm always looking for a story , " said @entity50 , whose career includes stints with @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
" in high fashion we 're always accused of doing things that are not very relevant , not the real world			1
i know that it 's important sometimes to do fantasy but i felt like touching people and going back to different women and men , especially the idea of different ages and body shapes			1
" it 's a timely message , he said , in an era of cultural bias toward youth - oriented ideals of beauty			1
" the phenomenon i see today of women erasing their age -- nobody is allowed to have an age anymore , nobody is allowed to have wrinkles or imperfections , " he said			0
" i thought , let 's change that , let 's show that fashion can be amazing on 81 - year - olds and 17 - year - olds , on @entity191 , who is not [ @entity194 ] size 36 , and she looks gorgeous			2
" while apparel and lifestyle brands have long been using " real people " to draw new audiences and generate buzz , it 's rare for a high - fashion house such as @entity35 to take this approach , said @entity204 , associate chair of fashion at the @entity206			1
but it 's happening more often , in ads and on the covers of fashion magazines , she said , as part of the effort to democratize fashion			2
has image overtaken music ? " the effect on viewers is that it 's easier for them to pictures themselves in the clothes and identify with the clothing line , " she said			0
" not only is it about democracy of fashion but it creates a buzz			2
how do you stand out as a fashion ad campaign ? by using people off the street it does generate buzz			1
" it also reflects the growing influence of street style blogs in touting alternative beauty ideals , said @entity238 , the writer behind the @entity79 blog , which led the casting agency to @entity1 and @entity77			2
" i think the message is to embrace individuality and personal style , and alternative notions of beauty , " @entity238 said			0
" it 's hugely important to show more diversity in advertising			0
by focusing on superyoung models and too much @entity252 , advertisers set up unreal expectations for consumers			0
" even if consumers like what they see in the @entity35 campaign , that does n't mean they 'll be able to afford it			1
for @entity1 , the vintage @entity35 jacket that she owned before the shoot will have to suffice , along with memories of being a queen for a day			2
" what are the odds that my first time out as a model i 'm with the top people in the field ? " she said			0
" it totally came to me , i did n't do anything to make this happen except be myself			0
it was all orchestrated by @entity274 , a gift from the universe			0
" how do you feel about fashion and reality colliding ? would you like to see more ' realistic ' fashion ads ? let us know your thoughts in the comments below .			2
