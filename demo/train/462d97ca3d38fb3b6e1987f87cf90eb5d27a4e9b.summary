@entity0 -- in a move that could shake up the @entity5 immigration system , the @entity2 is going to begin reviewing all 300,000 pending deportation cases in federal immigration courts to determine which individuals meet specific criteria for removal and to focus on " our highest priorities			1
" @entity2 secretary @entity12 said the review will enhance public safety			0
" immigration judges will be able to more swiftly adjudicate high priority cases , such as those involving convicted felons , " @entity15 wrote thursday in a letter to assistant majority leader sen. @entity17 , @entity18 , and 21 other senators including @entity22 @entity21 @entity20			1
in april , @entity17 and @entity20 sent a letter to @entity15 asking her to stop deportations of immigrant students who could earn legal status under the the @entity33 -- legislation that would give children of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship through military service or college education			2
@entity15 said the @entity42 administration has frequently pointed out " it makes no sense to expend our enforcement resources on low - priority cases , such as individuals ... who were brought into this country as young children and know no other home			1
" officials say immigration court dockets are clogged , putting public safety in jeopardy , costing money , resources and time			2
they want to see @entity2 enforcement resources diverted from illegal immigrants who do n't have criminal records to individuals who pose a threat to public safety and national security			2
a senior administration official , who requested anonymity because details of the policy change had not yet been announced , told reporters 79 % of deportations involve people without a criminal record -- people who have just entered the country illegally or had been previously deported and re-entered			1
@entity15 said the new policy change would not negate reforming immigration laws and " will not alleviate the need for passage of the @entity33 , " which would give legal status to illegal immigrant students who attend college or join the military			1
she added , " president @entity42 has called the @entity33 the right thing to do for the young people it would affect , and the right thing to do for the country			0
" but the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) , which advocates changing policies to decrease the number of immigrants coming to the @entity5 , said in a statement on its website that the action by the @entity42 administration " amounts to an administrative amnesty and a sweeping overhaul of the nation 's immigration policy without approval by @entity99			1
" @entity87 president @entity101 said in the statement , " in essence , the administration has declared that @entity5 immigration is now virtually unlimited to anyone willing to try to enter and only those who commit violent felonies after arrival are subject to enforcement			2
" under the new process , a @entity2 and the @entity111 working group will develop specific criteria to identify low - priority removal cases that should be considered for prosecutorial discretion , including cases with minors , the elderly , pregnant and nursing women , victims of serious crimes , veterans and members of the armed services and individuals with serious disabilities or health problems			1
@entity17 expressed support for the @entity42 administration announcement , saying in a written statement that it was " the right decision " specifically as it relates to students			0
" these students are the future doctors , lawyers , teachers and maybe , senators , who will make @entity5 stronger , " @entity17 stated			0
" we need to be doing all we can to keep these talented , dedicated , @entity5 students here , not wasting increasingly precious resources sending them away to countries they barely remember			0
" @entity17 's statement added that when reviews of individual cases result in cases being closed , those individuals " will be able to apply for certain immigration benefits , including work authorization			2
" @entity17 's statement did not elaborate on that aspect of the policy change , beyond saying such applications for benefits would be reviewed on a case - by - case basis			1
the @entity152 , an organization advocating improved rights for day laborers , praised the move			0
" the administration had earned the president the title of ' deporter - in - chief			0
' we hope the statement today announcing review of the current caseload of victims of indiscriminate enforcement is carried forth , " the group said in a news release			0
@entity1 en @entity168 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
