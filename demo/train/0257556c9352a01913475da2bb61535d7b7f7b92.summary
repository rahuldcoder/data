we hire presidents to shoulder for us the weight of the world			0
given the size and importance of their job , it 's natural that we resent any time they spend not studying , discussing , thinking about or building support for the decisions they must make -- decisions that affect the lives of millions			1
how can a president ever feel well - enough informed ? how can he turn off his desk light , close up shop and retire to the @entity20 residence to help his children with their homework ? presidents belong to us			2
if the kids need help with homework , hire a tutor , whose time is not so precious			2
except that it does n't work that way			2
until technology enables us to elect robots to the @entity20 , we 're stuck with presidents who , like the rest of us , are human beings , mere mortals who must spend time with family , unwind with friends , sleep , eat , veg out in front of the tv			1
indeed , only a robot could perform so demanding a job without time spent away from it			2
almost since he took office , president @entity46 has faced criticism for a supposedly aloof style that causes him to neglect a key facet of his responsibilities			1
he lacks the human touch , goes this line of thinking , in a business that demands it			0
he refuses to attend to the care and feeding of the lawmakers whose votes he needs , and is reluctant to provide simple favors , such as posing for photographs , to the wealthy donors whose money he needs			0
speaking to @entity67 's @entity66 for the documentary " @entity46 revealed : @entity69 , the president , " @entity46 denied that his apparent standoffishness results from an icy personality : " sometimes @entity70 and i not doing the circuit and going out to dinners with folks is perceived as us being cool			1
it actually really has more to do with us being parents			0
" in other words , while he is @entity81 's only president , he is also his daughters ' only father ; his duty to them demands that he take time out from his duty to his country			1
and so he makes sure that at 6:30 each evening he 's seated at the family dinner table			2
after the meal , he helps his daughters with their homework			0
while the president 's devotion to his family is something we can all admire , i wonder if he doth protest too much			1
it may be counterintuitive that people of elite status , whether by virtue of elective office or a hefty wallet , are so insecure that they need coddling before they will support a cause they believe in			2
but we all know that egos require stroking from time to time -- elite ones , perhaps , most of all			2
it seems that @entity46 neglects that task less because of his devotion to his family than because of his distaste for the process			1
a recent @entity114 profile of @entity46 's closest friend and adviser , @entity117 , revealed that the @entity20 needlessly snubbed @entity118			1
presumably acting at the president 's behest , @entity119 turned down the liberal billionaire 's request for a private meeting with @entity46 to discuss the economy			1
whether or not that cold shoulder is the cause , @entity118 and his money are sitting this election out			0
with moguls such as the @entity132 brothers and @entity133 bankrolling super pacs on the other side of this tight race , @entity46 needs all the help he can get			1
while we may respect the president 's disinclination to bow before great wealth , his failure to cultivate @entity118 may prove to be an expensive mistake			0
@entity144 , the last president in office with a child of grade - school age , tried to be present in his daughter 's life			1
@entity150 , a political consultant who worked for @entity144 in @entity151 and @entity152 , recalled that when he and then - gov. @entity144 would travel for the day out of @entity154 they would start out at the governor 's mansion : " i 'd get there in the morning and the first thing we would do is drop @entity159 off at school			1
he took @entity159 to school every day			0
he said , ' let me give you a piece of advice if you 're going to have a life in politics			0
take your kids to school in the morning , because you never know what time you 're going to get home at night			0
' " as president , @entity144 did spend time with his daughter during evenings when he could			1
like @entity46 , he helped with the day 's homework			1
when he was out of town , he 'd supply the assistance by telephone			0
but unlike @entity46 , @entity144 always found time to connect with people			1
while the self - contained current president is said to hold only a few friends close , the extroverted former president craves constant human contact			0
he would spend hours on the phone with members of @entity185 and his cabinet , cajoling them on a vote or asking their advice or gaming out their appearance the next day on " @entity190			0
" he also stayed in touch with friends -- from around the country , but particularly from @entity151			0
when he could n't make it to @entity154 to reconnect with home , home would come to him			0
old friends would stay overnight at the @entity20 , although they might not sleep much , given that games of hearts with the president would extend into the wee hours of the morning			0
as busy as they have been , all presidents have set aside personal time			1
many -- @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , both @entity206 , @entity144 , @entity46 -- have played golf			1
@entity208 took his daily constitutional and played poker with his pals			0
@entity213 , perhaps the most diligent worker of the bunch , played tennis			0
@entity222 found time for such activities as phoning a @entity225 clothier to order , in exacting and earthy detail , half a dozen pairs of pants			1
@entity204 spent time , well - lubricated by scotch whiskey , in @entity231 with his friend @entity233 - @entity81 businessman @entity232			0
and , of course , @entity144 and @entity211 put aside affairs of state to pursue affairs of a different nature			1
@entity144 's obsessive need for human interaction led him to cross boundaries of appropriate behavior , and not just with @entity243			1
much to the consternation of those on the other end of the telephone , @entity144 would call at all hours -- late in the evening , even well past midnight			2
@entity249 , his first secretary of the treasury , turned off his phone rather than endure such intrusions			0
one @entity253 former congressman told me that he would answer the phone , then lay the receiver down as the president talked and the congressman and his wife tried to get back to sleep			0
former sen. @entity261 of @entity262 , a key ally of @entity144 's , recalled of the late - night communications , " my wife would pick up the phone and felt it was either one of the children who had gotten in an automobile accident or it was @entity144			2
all the times it was @entity144			2
" so if members of @entity185 feel slighted by @entity46 's lack of attention , they can at least take consolation that he 's not keeping them from a good night 's sleep .			2

criticized for his aloof style , president @entity46 says he likes to spend time with family
@entity282 : @entity46 seems standoffish because he does n't like to *schmooze*
he says unlike @entity46 , president @entity144 always found time to connect with people
@entity282 : the way each president has set up his private life depends on his personality
