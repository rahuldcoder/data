@entity0 -- about 400 members of an exiled @entity4 opposition group who are the first to leave a long - term camp in @entity6 under a @entity8 plan criticized their treatment and the conditions at the new temporary site saturday			1
the group left @entity15 at midnight following 12 hours of inspections and checks , @entity12 of the @entity13 said in a statement			0
when they arrived seven hours later at the new site , a former @entity21 military base near @entity22 called @entity23 , the group discovered a heavy presence of police			1
another inspection was then demanded , prompting the residents to protest what they consider " degrading , humiliating and inhumane treatment " and the obstructive behavior of the @entity6 forces by refusing to leave the transit buses , @entity12 said			2
" the preliminary reports indicate that @entity23 is a prison from all aspects , " he added			0
the group 's relocation to the new site was agreed between the @entity8 , @entity6 authorities , the @entity21 and the @entity39			1
from there , the @entity8 high commissioner for refugees will begin efforts to resettle the group outside of the country			2
@entity45 , the @entity8 secretary general 's special representative and head of the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , was at the temporary site to welcome the new arrivals			1
" this is the first step towards a better future outside @entity6 , " he said			2
" i look forward to their continued cooperation with the @entity6 authorities to complete the relocation without delay			1
" he also praised the @entity6 for having ensured the " safe and secure relocation " of the first group of residents and urged them to guarantee the human rights and safety of all those still to relocate			2
@entity15 has been home to members of the @entity67 , or @entity67 , for more than 25 years			0
more than 3,000 exiles , described as @entity4 resistance figures and their sympathizers , live at the camp			0
the @entity67 has been on the @entity21 terrorism list since 1997 because of the killing of six @entity21 in @entity4 in the 1970s and an attempted attack against the @entity4 mission to the @entity8 in 1992			1
however , since 2004 , the @entity21 has considered the residents of @entity15 " noncombatants " and " protected persons " under the @entity79			1
before moving , the @entity15 residents had demanded a commitment that no @entity6 police would remain inside the new site , in order to ensure the security of the residents			1
the group believes the current regime in @entity6 , under orders from prime minister @entity90 , has previously staged deadly attacks against @entity15			1
instead , there are several police posts inside the facility and residents must be accompanied by the police even to go to the dining area , @entity12 said			0
" the most important of the @entity15 residents ' demands is that the police must leave the camp area and stay outside the walls , " a statement released by the group friday said			1
" this is a condition without which it will be impossible to have more people in @entity23 as it will result in further confrontations , tensions and killing			0
" the residents also asked for guarantees with regards to the site 's infrastructure -- and say these have not been met			0
" in a nutshell , @entity23 lacks the most basic international humanitarian standards and human rights standards are not met , " the statement said			0
the residents say the camp is much smaller than they were told it would be , and that they are being denied free movement and access to medical services			0
the @entity8 's refugee agency confirmed that the new camp 's infrastructure and facilities were in line with international humanitarian standards at the end of january , @entity8 secretary general @entity123 said earlier this week			0
@entity15 was established in 1986 after former @entity6 leader @entity131 invited members of the @entity67 to relocate to @entity6 in an effort to undermine the @entity4 government , which was then at war with @entity6			1
@entity4 also considers the group to be a terrorist organization			0
a @entity8 commission on refugees has described the residents as " formal asylum seekers " from persecution by the regime in @entity4			2
the temporary facility , at what was formerly the @entity21 - run @entity23 , will remain open for an unspecified period of time , though a senior @entity21 administration official said in december that there were plans to keep it open until all of the camp residents were resettled			2
@entity1 's @entity153 contributed to this report .			0
