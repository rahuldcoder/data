-- @entity1 became the first @entity3 man to win a @entity5 final since @entity6 in 1936 after defeating @entity7 in the final of the @entity9			1
the @entity10 even surrendered a two - set lead during a five - set thriller that lasted almost five hours , before he regained his focus to win 7 - 6 ( 12 - 10 ) 7 - 5 2 - 6 3 - 6 6 - 2 in swirling winds at @entity15			1
it proved to be fifth time lucky for the @entity19 champion , who -- like his coach @entity20 -- had lost his previous four @entity5 finals			1
@entity1 will now replace the injured @entity22 as world @entity23 in the official men 's rankings			1
' shocked ' @entity27 wins @entity9 final thriller " they were incredibly tricky conditions			2
it was really tough because @entity7 is really strong and fights all the way , " said @entity1 after the final			1
" i have always had tough matches with him			2
i do n't know how i managed to come through in the end			0
" with his support team in @entity37 swelled by fellow celebrity @entity38 , @entity41 manager @entity40 and actor @entity42 , the 25 year old singled out @entity20 , a three - time @entity9 champion , for praise			2
" he was one of the greatest , " @entity1 said			1
" he has helped me through the tough times as have all of my team			0
it 's the best feeling for me , i 've had an unbelievable summer			2
" @entity1 put the bitter disappointment of losing this year 's @entity53 final against @entity54 behind him by taking the @entity55 at the @entity56 at the @entity59 star 's expense -- a result many believed could be a turning point in the @entity64 - born star 's @entity5 fortunes			1
but it was never going to be easy on monday night			0
after narrowly losing the first two sets , @entity7 proved why he was the 2011 champion in @entity37 , as he battled back to take the third and fourth sets with apparent ease as far as the scoreboard was concerned -- but in reality both players fought tooth and nail for every single point			0
though the momentum appeared to be with @entity7 , @entity1 refused to give up and summoned his earlier verve and aggression to put his visibly tiring opponent on the back foot once again			1
not even a late pause for treatment on the @entity83 's cramping leg could prevent @entity1 from closing in on the prize @entity3 tennis has coveted for 76 years , much to the delight of the crowd inside the cavernous @entity88			1
when the final shot of the match -- a rasping forehand from @entity7 -- went long , @entity1 was left visibly stunned by his achievement			2
but he had finally overcome lingering doubts about his mental fortitude when it mattered most			0
despite his own disappointment , @entity7 was quick to pay pay tribute to his great friend and rival			0
" it was n't to be and i want to congratulate @entity1 on a first @entity5			1
he deserves it , " said the @entity83			0
" i tried my best and i gave it my all			0
it was another tremendous match and i am proud to have been part of it			0
