-- @entity1 is taking its last big step before releasing what promises to be a massive overhaul of its @entity6 operating system -- and , by extension , how almost all devices running it work			1
nearing the end of a long process of tinkering under the hood , the computing giant on friday rolled out its final preview of @entity15 , which is expected to go on sale this fall			1
" since our first preview release last september , millions of people now use the pre-release product on a daily basis and millions more have been taking it through its paces , totaling hundreds of millions of hours of testing , " @entity1 's @entity17 wrote friday on the @entity15 blog			1
" we genuinely appreciate the effort that so many have put into pre-release testing , and of course , we appreciate the feedback too			0
direct feedback and feedback through usage contributed to hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under - the - hood changes			0
" the post said @entity1 has received about 18,000 comments from 7,000 early testers of @entity15 , which have contributed to " hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under - the - hood changes			2
" the release will mark the first major update of @entity1 's operating system since @entity44 was released three years ago			1
unlike previous releases that have , essentially , revamped ( or , in at least one case , mercifully killed ) existing features , @entity1 is touting @entity6 8 as a radical reimagining of its core product			1
perhaps its most visible difference from previous versions of @entity6 will be its compatibility with touchscreen technology			0
that , combined with the system 's ability to connect devices ( say , a pc , a tablet and a @entity61 gaming console ) is what @entity1 hopes will renew the enduring @entity63 vs. pc war on a new front			1
" in our hands - on of @entity1 's @entity69 , we declared that your familiar @entity6 desktop is all but dead , " @entity66 wrote friday for @entity67			1
" in the changes we 've seen in the @entity74 , this still holds true , " she added			0
" @entity1 is focused on improving and deepening the @entity75 [ the system 's design language ] experience , where the desktop is only a portion -- or even an afterthought , for some users -- of a larger , app - based system			2
" the company has made something of a ripple with its smartphone system , at least among critics			0
the recently released @entity89 has been heralded as the best @entity6 phone ever , although , as of march , only about 4 % of @entity92 smartphones ran the company 's operating system			1
( for what it 's worth , that 's a month before the @entity98 was released			0
) but @entity1 has barely moved the needle in the tablet space , where @entity101 still rules the roost , and only a simpler and less expensive device like @entity105 's @entity104 has been able to put up much resistance			2
even as the final @entity15 trial was being announced , reports were surfacing that @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 all plan to unveil @entity6 tablets next week at the @entity114 trade show in @entity115			1
meanwhile , many in the tech world are watching and waiting			0
with its prowess in the computing world , it 's impossible to count @entity1 out			0
but with @entity101 and @entity124 's @entity123 system grabbing the attention and market share in the mobile world , @entity1 appears to have an uphill battle			2
" there 's a long , narrow road ahead for @entity15 , " reviewer @entity129 wrote for @entity130			0
" it could be the next big thing , but there 's not much room for missteps			0

@entity1 rolls out its final preview version of @entity15
