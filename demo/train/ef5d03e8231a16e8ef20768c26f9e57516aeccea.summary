@entity0 -- in a highly symbolic break with previous policy , @entity2 reopened its border crossing into @entity6 on saturday , opening the door for @entity8 to the outside world and raising fears among some @entity11 that militant attacks will increase			1
" procedures were excellent , " said @entity13 , who described his travel into @entity2 as the first such visit in his life			2
" i hope there will be peace between our people and i want to thank the @entity2 people and the @entity2 government ... we always hope for easier ways for @entity8 because our people suffered enough			2
" crossing officials said more than 600 palestinians passed saturday through the @entity29 border , which had been subject to frequent closures by @entity2 after @entity32 , an @entity33 militant group , took control of @entity6 in june 2007			1
the closure of the border had been part of an embargo policy by @entity2 and @entity11 aimed at cutting off @entity32 , though it simultaneously created an economic hardship in @entity6 by limiting shipments of goods in and out of the country			1
@entity2 opted to reopen the border to offer relief to the people of @entity6 , said ambassador @entity46 of the country 's foreign ministry			2
" today , we are facing a new stage , a new stage were this blockade is defeated , " said a @entity32 representative at the crossing			0
" this step is to support the resistance of the @entity8 people to face the @entity59 blockade			0
" " this is a @entity8 - @entity2 frontier and it 's not the business of the invaders , " said @entity60 , general director of border police			1
" this border does not submit but to the @entity2 - @entity8 rule			1
" @entity69 adviser and negotiator @entity68 heralded the move by the government in @entity73 , calling it a " brave and bold decision " that demonstrated " the new @entity2 stands by the @entity8 people			0
" it was seen as a victory by many in the @entity32 government of @entity6 , which staged a celebration rally saturday near the crossing			1
some in @entity11 's security establishment have privately expressed concerns that the increased traffic at @entity29 could serve to allow more militants and weapons to cross in and out of @entity6 and that it could ultimately serve to bolster the position of @entity32 , which @entity11 and the @entity87 consider a terrorist organization , but the @entity11 government has said little publicly			1
neither the office of @entity11 prime minister @entity91 nor the foreign ministry would publicly comment due to the sensitive nature of relations with @entity2			0
@entity95 , who serves as director of @entity97 , an @entity11 organization that advocates for @entity8 freedom of movement , welcomed the changes at the crossing and said @entity11 need not be overly concerned			2
" it continues to prevent goods from traveling via @entity29 and it also continues to limit travel to those listed in the @entity11 - approved @entity8 population registry , " @entity95 said of the new @entity2 policy			1
" @entity2 is allowing an incremental and welcome change , but it is still expressing its willingness to engage @entity11 and engage @entity11 security concerns			0
" the @entity29 crossing was open sporadically between june and january , when @entity2 ordered it opened to those in need of medical care , students , and foreign passport and residency card holders			0
among those people allowed to cross were those wounded during an @entity11 assault aboard a flotilla of ships headed to @entity6 last year			0
@entity29 is one of two crossings through which @entity8 can exit @entity6 ; the other is controlled by @entity11 and bars passage by most @entity8 save for those with emergency medical conditions			1
since the flotilla raid , @entity11 has allowed a greater amount of goods to enter @entity6 , but it still maintains a complete blockade of the airspace and territorial waters and has limited most exports			0
after @entity2 president @entity138 was forced from office , the interim government promised to reopen the border			0
@entity1 's @entity141 and @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
