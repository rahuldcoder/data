@entity0 was thrilled when she heard about @entity3 sgt. @entity2 's release			1
she hopes her father will be next			0
gunmen abducted @entity6 nearly three years ago from his home in @entity8 , @entity9			2
they posed as neighbors , offered food and then pistol - whipped the @entity14 aid worker and tied up his guards			1
now he 's being held by @entity16			1
and as political backlash over the controversial prisoner swap for @entity2 grows , @entity0 's daughter says her happiness for the soldier and his family has turned to worry			1
" we started to realize that the administration is going to be a lot less likely to do this again if it causes some political problems for them , " she told @entity31 's " @entity30 " on wednesday			0
" so does that mean that the door is closed for us ? " for years , when @entity6 's case came up , @entity14 officials called for his release but repeatedly said @entity37 would n't bargain with @entity16			1
now , @entity0 says it 's clear that negotiating is an option			2
" they have shown with this exchange that they can get this done			2
if they want to , they can do this , " she said			0

he was incredibly pale and gaunt			0
... my father is certainly not in good health , " she said			0
listening to @entity72 administration officials justify the swap by pointing out that @entity2 was a soldier does n't ease her worries			0
" my father is just as deserving of freedom as sgt. @entity2 , as are all of the @entity14 who are being held abroad , " she said			1
" you can not distinguish between these hostages			0
... they ca n't just pick and choose , decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there			0
" just a few months after @entity0 's capture , @entity16 leader @entity86 released a recording claiming the terror group was holding @entity0 -- and demanding , among other things , an end to airstrikes by the @entity14			1
he described the captive as " a former employee and a current contractor working with the @entity14 government in its aid program to @entity9 , which aims to fight the jihad in @entity9 and @entity99 , and just like the @entity14 arrest any suspect linked to @entity16 and the @entity101 , even if they were far related			1

he is a world - renowned development expert , according to the company 's website			0
in the video @entity16 released of him in december , @entity6 said he felt abandoned			1
