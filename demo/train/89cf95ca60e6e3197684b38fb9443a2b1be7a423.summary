@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 has concluded @entity1 carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people , president @entity3 said wednesday , a claim that comes amid a looming diplomatic showdown over whether to strike against @entity10 's military			1
@entity3 's declaration to " @entity12 " came at the end of a day that saw @entity15 and @entity16 walk out of a @entity18 meeting as word surfaced @entity20 planned to pursue a resolution to authorize the use of force against @entity1 , even as @entity25 weapons inspectors were in @entity1 assessing whether chemical weapons have been used			1
" we do not believe that , given the delivery systems , using rockets , that the opposition could have carried out these attacks			2
we have concluded that the @entity1 government in fact carried these out , " @entity3 told " @entity12			1
" " and if that 's so , then there need to be international consequences , " the president added			2
@entity3 said that he has " not made a decision " about whether to conduct a military strike in @entity1			1
allegations of a chemical weapons attack carried out by @entity10 's forces in a @entity0 suburb last week triggered the international machinations , which have been growing as body counts on both sides in the more - than - 2 - year - old civil war have increased			1
those who claimed to have survived the alleged chemical weapons attack described a horrific scene in the town of @entity53			1
" after the chemicals , they woke us up and told us to put masks on , " a 6 - year - old boy said , describing the alleged attack			0
" i told my dad i ca n't breathe			0
my father then fainted and i fainted right after that , but we were found and taken to the emergency room			0
" @entity2 obtained video of the boy and others who made the claims to a journalist in the area			2
@entity71 's government has blamed rebels for carrying out the attack , a claim that @entity3 told @entity12 was impossible			1
" we have looked at all the evidence , and we do not believe the opposition possessed ... chemical weapons of that sort , " he said			1
" we do not believe that , given the delivery systems , using rockets , that the opposition could have carried out these attacks			2
" in the video obtained by @entity2 , one man claimed he evacuated two dead bodies during the attack			2
" then there was another explosion			0
i could n't breathe , i had cramps and i could n't see			0
" the horror of the attack on civilians has jolted the world into potential action on a crisis that has killed more than 100,000 people , according to the @entity25			0
last week was not the first time chemical weapons are believed to have been used in the conflict			1
but it was by far the worst			0
' red line ' debate : chemical weapons worse than attacks ? " @entity1 is now undoubtedly the most serious crisis facing the international community , " @entity108 , @entity25 and @entity109 special envoy to @entity1 , said wednesday in @entity110			1
" it does seem that some kind of substance was used that killed a lot of people , " he said			0
the death toll could be in the hundreds , or possibly more than a thousand , he said			0
@entity108 said the crisis in @entity1 shows how important it is " for the @entity1 and the international community to really develop the political will to address this issue seriously and look for solutions for it			2
" @entity126 also followed suit with a warning of its own wednesday			0
" the @entity1 regime maintains custody of stockpiles of chemical weapons			1
information available from a wide variety of sources points to the @entity1 regime as responsible for the use of chemical weapons in these attacks			1
this is a clear breach of long - standing international norms and practice			0
" any use of such weapons is unacceptable and can not go unanswered			0
those responsible must be held accountable			0
we consider the use of chemical weapons as a threat to international peace and security , " @entity126 said in a statement			1
some @entity1 have told @entity2 they doubt their government used chemical weapons			1
' not warmongers ' @entity1 ambassador to the @entity25 @entity156 lashed out wednesday at the warnings and threats			2
" we are not warmongers			0
we are a peaceful nation seeking stability in the area because instability would serve the @entity169 interests , " he told reporters at the @entity25 headquarters in @entity163			0
" we are in a state of war , " and preparing for the possibility of such a scenario , he said			0
" the @entity1 government is looking for stability			2
" @entity156 accused rebels of obtaining material to produce chemical weapons " from outside powers -- mainly speaking , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180			1
" intervening in @entity182 turmoil : mission impossible ? in a letter to the @entity25 , @entity1 asked for the @entity25 weapons inspectors to stay in the country beyond their weekend deadline , @entity156 said			1
@entity25 @entity189 ban ki - moon did not address the letter directly but seemed to ask for a reprieve wednesday for the sake of the inspectors			0
" the team needs time to do its job , " he said from @entity193 , where he visited the @entity194			0
he said the inspectors had already collected valuable evidence			0
' groundless excuses ' @entity15 , a close ally of @entity1 , is expected to use its veto power to block a resolution , setting up a possible diplomatic showdown			2
foreign minister @entity203 insists there is no proof yet @entity1 's government is behind the chemical weapons attack			1
the ministry accused @entity209 of trying to " create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention			0
" " the @entity213 handles the @entity215 world the way a monkey handles a grenade , " @entity15 deputy prime minister @entity212 tweeted			0
missile strikes on @entity1 likely response to chemical attack @entity16 , which also has a permanent seat on the council , would also probably object to military measures			1
" it 's time that the @entity25 @entity18 shouldered its responsibilities on @entity1 , which for the past two and a half years it 's failed to do , " @entity20 foreign secretary @entity227 said wednesday			1
he added that even if @entity16 and @entity15 veto a resolution , " we and other nations still have a responsibility " to act			0
@entity234 foreign minister @entity233 , meanwhile , warned of " graver conditions " if strikes are carried out against @entity1			1
" if any country attacks another when it wants , that is like the @entity240 , " he said			0
who wants what after chemical weapons horror @entity1 : chemical weapons -- how did we get here ? @entity4 ruled out ground troops for almost two years , @entity3 has avoided direct military involvement in @entity1 's bloody civil war as the death toll skyrocketed to more than 100,000 , according to @entity25 estimates			1
but @entity3 had warned that a chemical attack would cross a " red line			1
" the @entity253 previously ruled out sending ground troops to @entity1 or implementing a no - fly zone to blunt @entity10 's aerial superiority over rebels			1
@entity1 strikes could worsen war , analysts say @entity108 said international law requires that that the @entity18 approve military action			2
" i do know that president @entity3 and the @entity4 administration are not known to be trigger - happy , " he said			1
" what they will decide i do n't know			0
" outside of the @entity25 , a military coalition is taking shape among @entity270 powers			0
@entity271 has also signaled it would join @entity270 military intervention against forces supporting @entity10			0
president @entity274 said @entity271 is " ready to punish those who made the decision to gas these innocent people			1
" the @entity271 @entity278 will hold a session next week to debate the situation in @entity1			2
@entity282 chancellor @entity281 and @entity20 prime minister @entity283 spoke by telephone wednesday about the crisis			1

" both agreed this is a break in the already long ongoing internal conflict and that it can not continue unpunished therefore an international reaction is inevitable			1
both hope no member of the @entity18 will close their eyes to this crime against humanity and that the corresponding consequences will be decided			0
" @entity20 's @entity278 , meanwhile , is voting on a motion thursday that would rule out any consideration of possible military action until the @entity25 chemical weapons inspectors explain their findings to the @entity18			1
after the inspectors have made their findings , members of @entity278 would be required to take another vote , according to the motion being put forward			0
