-- @entity2 's voice assistant took an extended coffee break on thursday			1
asked by the blog @entity5 what she 'd been doing during an apparent service outage , @entity9 , the voice - controlled " assistant " that 's the standout feature of the new @entity11 , replied in a way that would raise any employer 's eyebrows : she just listed the names of a bunch of day spas			1
" @entity9 where have you been all day ? " the blogger asked			2
her response : " i found 12 places matching ' all day ' ... 11 of them are not far from you			0
" well , at least she responded			0
for much of thursday -- five hours , according to @entity0 's partner site @entity27 -- @entity2 's voice - controlled assistant was n't functioning at all for some people , apparently because of a server outage			1
@entity9 needs to communicate with computers that are in the cloud to understand and process voice commands , leading observers to believe something went wrong with that system			1
@entity2 has n't commented on the outage and did not immediately respond to @entity0 's request for information			1
many @entity11 users , when they asked @entity9 questions thursday , reported being greeted with this : " sorry , i 'm having trouble connecting to the network			1
" that message came even when phones were connected to @entity48 or 3g networks , according to the reports , which surfaced on tech blogs and @entity52			0
some @entity9 users felt kind of lost without their personal assistant			1
that 's pretty amazing when you consider that @entity9 is definitely a new hire			1
the @entity11 went on sale october 14			2
but some people already have come to depend on her in those three weeks			2
" ( @entity62 ) t was awful			0
i had to use the annoying google app to find a jamba juice ! ! " the @entity52 user @ @entity67 _ wrote in response to a question from @entity0 about the outage			0
" she 's usually pretty reliable although sassy , " that user said			0
tech writers debated which management style might be best for this errant helper			0
@entity76 at @entity77 thought it might be best to cut her some slack			0
" granted , @entity9 is still a beta product -- and this is what happens to beta products -- but when @entity2 promotes @entity9 as one of the best and @entity86 - got ta - have - it new features of its latest device through its cloying new tv ads , it 's worth noticing when the service does n't quite deliver as promised , " she wrote			1
others see her responsibilities -- namely answering her owner 's questions , finding directions , calling people and looking up songs to play -- as unrealistic given @entity9 's job qualifications			1
maybe it 's too much to think the servers that run @entity9 -- a complicated and fairly new technology that 's been tried and failed before -- would always be up and running			2
" not only is @entity106 still in its infancy -- a condition it 's been in for more than half a century -- but it relies in its current incarnation on networks and servers whose unreliability you can bank on , " @entity104 wrote on @entity27 's @entity2 2.0 blog			2
" good thing the @entity11 still has a touchscreen			2
" things may turn out ok though			0
so far , no one seems to want to fire @entity9 just yet			0
well , except maybe this @entity119 .			0
