@entity1 and @entity2 safety officials asked regulators on thursday for new rules to prevent rail accidents like the one that decimated the @entity9 town of @entity10 last july			1
the @entity11 and the @entity12 say the growing use of trains to ship highly volatile crude oil is endangering communities in both countries			2
" the large - scale shipment of crude oil by rail simply did n't exist 10 years ago , and our safety regulations need to catch up with this new reality , " @entity11 chairman @entity18 said in a statement			2
" while this energy boom is good for business , the people and the environment along rail corridors must be protected from harm			2
" forty - seven @entity10 residents died and the town 's center destroyed when an unattended train hauling oil descended down a grade , derailed , and erupted in fire			1
the @entity1 and @entity2 safety agencies that investigate accidents issued an unprecedented joint recommendation calling for a series of new rules			1
crude oil shipment by rail has increased over 400 % since 2005 , the @entity11 said , citing figures from the @entity44			0
the growth has been spurred by increased drilling in the @entity48 region of @entity49 , @entity50 and adjoining provinces in @entity2			1
@entity2 safety officials still have not ruled on the cause of the @entity54			2
but they have said the highly volatile oil in tanker cars was improperly described in shipping documents as a less flammable substance			0
the petroleum cruel oil was a hazardous " @entity62 , @entity63 " product , but was shipped as a " @entity63 " product , investigators said			0
the misidentification explains in part why the fuel ignited so quickly after the derailment , authorities said			0
but investigators have not said whether the shipping error was intentional or inadvertent , and suggested it was unlikely the error made a difference since both types of fuel -- @entity76 -- are shipped in the same class 111 tank cars			0
following the @entity10 catastrophe , the @entity78 and the @entity79 issued a safety advisory and announced an operation to conduct unannounced inspections and testing of crude oil that shipped by rail			1
but the @entity11 said it " remains concerned the practice of mischaracterizing the packing groups of crude oil shipments may allow shippers to avoid " security requirements			1
the @entity11 is recommending that rail and hazardous materials safety agencies require expanded planning for railroads to avoid populated areas when shipping petroleum products when possible			0
it is also wants an audit program to ensure railroads have adequate capabilities to respond to " worst - case discharges " of products carried on a train			0
and it asks the government to audit shippers and railroads to ensure they are properly classifying hazardous materials and have adequate safety and security plans in place			0
the @entity11 and its @entity2 counterpart issued the safety recommendations jointly because railroad companies routinely operate crude oil unit trains in both countries and across the border .			1

joint @entity1 / @entity2 recommendation aims to prevent accidents
they were *prompted* by a derailment that killed *47* people in @entity10 , @entity9
an increase in oil shipments in @entity2 and the @entity1 and across the border raising concern
