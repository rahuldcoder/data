@entity9 secured back - to - back victories at the @entity15 @entity14 in front of a capacity crowd of 135,000 , overtaking @entity18 's @entity1 on lap 42 of 56 in @entity19 and relegating the 25 - year - old to second in his 100th @entity5 race			1
@entity2 kept his title dream alive by finishing third , and gained a controversial place on the grid before the race after teammate @entity26 broke the seal on his @entity29 's gearbox and took a five place penalty			1
it all points towards a dramatic climax in @entity33 , where @entity1 will defend a 13 - point lead over his @entity36 rival , needing to finish fourth or higher to retain the world championship			1
latest @entity5 standings the race marked a triumphant return to the @entity15 for @entity5 after an absence of five years , with drivers and pundits impressed with the show put on at the newly built @entity45			1
though he did n't clinch the drivers ' championship crown , @entity1 's performance did ensure @entity18 won the constructors ' championship for the third time in a row			1
but the @entity11 , who was heard to be angry on the team radio after @entity9 passed him , blamed @entity56 backmarker @entity55 for slowing him down at a critical moment of the race			1
" i was n't too happy to send a nice big invitation to @entity9 when i had to go through @entity55 , " he said			2
" he was right behind in the @entity61 zone			0
he took that opportunity , fair enough , down the straight and he passed me			0
i tried to defend , but i knew he would have so much more speed			0
" i was obviously not too happy			0
@entity9 had one chance and he took it			2
after that i tried to stay with him , but there was n't much between us			0
" @entity1 got to the first corner in front of the chasing pack off the grid and his teammate @entity74 was able to steal a place on @entity76 and move into second			2
but after @entity74 retired with mechanical failure on lap 17 @entity9 began stalking @entity1 until he engaged his @entity61 boost to flick past the @entity11 14 laps from home , the pair 's cars only a matter of inches apart			1
can @entity5 rekindle its @entity15 dream ? @entity2 jumped a place after @entity29 's decision to invoke a five - place grid penalty for @entity26 , which meant he switched from the dusty , slower portion of the track to the clean side			1
the difference was clear as @entity2 charged round the outside and gained three places going into the first corner			2
the @entity99 also benefited from @entity74 's retirement as he held on to third place			0
@entity26 battled his way up to fourth place while @entity9 's @entity105 teammate @entity104 claimed fifth			2
@entity9 , who will end his long association with @entity105 after the final race of the campaign in @entity7 , was elated with his victory , his second successive triumph in the @entity15 after winning the last @entity111 at @entity112 in 2007			1

" it 's been a long time since we had a win			0
i 'm so proud of the team and grateful for the support we 've had			0
