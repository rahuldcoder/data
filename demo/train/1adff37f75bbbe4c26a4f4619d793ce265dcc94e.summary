@entity0 -- the @entity2 has passed the @entity4 budget plan submitted by rep. @entity5 , but some budget experts believe that he federal government is so far in the red that it may not balance the budget again in our lifetime			1
" we may never , as a country , have a balanced budget again , " said @entity12 , policy director for the @entity13			1
" and you know what ? we do n't have to			0
" @entity12 is a bit of a budget wunderkind who was also a staffer for the @entity21 , established by president @entity22 to address the nation 's fiscal problems , and for the congressional super committee			1
he and the nonpartisan think tank where he works used to push vehemently for a balanced budget			2
now the bumper sticker hanging in his cubicle reads , " stabilize the @entity31			0
" he feels that @entity0 has fallen so deep into the deficit hole that it has set off a seismic shift among some fiscal hawks			1
they now hope to contain the deficit , not erase it			2
" it 'd be great if we could balance the budget , " @entity12 said			1
" but ... it 's just not realistic to look at balancing the budget right now			2
right now , what we need to look at is bringing the debt down relative to the economy			0
" the @entity5 budget , despite its cuts and aggressive fiscal moves , does not balance the budget for at least 23 years , according to the @entity52 and the @entity53			1
@entity2 passes @entity4 budget " this just shows you how deep of a hole our country is in , " @entity5 , a @entity55 @entity4 and chairman of the @entity52 , said when asked about the 2035 budget balance date			1
but in a city where politicians pass appropriation legislation for a few months or sometimes even a few days at a time , such a long timeline for balancing the budget seems hypothetical at best and meaningless at worst			2
hence that unlikely catchphrase " stabilize the debt			0
" the idea is to keep government 's annual deficits small enough that they are outpaced by the growth in the economy			0
that , some say , would stop the current explosive path the national debt is on			0
for example , the @entity53 estimates that the 2011 deficit was nearly 9 % of the economy , as measured by gross domestic product			2
but gdp itself grew by less than 2 % during the same time			0
think of the economy as a living thing , like a tree			0
if the tree grew by a couple of feet last year but the deficit burned up several times that growth , it would use far more resources than had been created in the past year			2
@entity12 and those who share his outlook want a budget under which that tree , the economy , grows by more than the deficit is burning and keeps adding fiscal height overall			1
but under this scenario , the debt itself would probably grow -- just more slowly			0
" we do n't need a balanced budget , " @entity12 concluded			2
" what we need to do is stabilize the debt relative to the economy			0
" to do that would take about $ 4 trillion in deficit cuts , he and others estimate			1
the @entity5 budget gets there , but barely			0
the problem ? " we 're not going to get to this with one party , " @entity12 asserted			0
" the public , i do n't think , is going to be able to tolerate the level of cuts in congressman @entity5 's plan , even though the level of deficit reduction is only a little bit more than what we need			1
" neither , @entity12 said , would the public tolerate a federal spending plan that cuts the deficit solely by raising taxes			1
so nearly everyone in @entity0 admits that it would require compromise , but few admit that even a tough - to - get compromise most likely will just stabilize the budget , not balance it			1
follow @entity136 on @entity137 at @ @entity138 .			0

new : @entity2 approves @entity141 budget , *228* - *191* , will send to @entity142
expert who looked at numbers said it now may be *impossible* to balance the budget
huge cuts and significant taxes would be required to dig out of deficit hole
