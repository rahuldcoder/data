a former top appointee of @entity1 says there is evidence contradicting what the @entity5 governor has said publicly about the notorious @entity8 traffic lane closures that have roiled the @entity10 's administration , according to the man 's lawyer			1
@entity13 resigned his position at the @entity15 and @entity5 in december amid allegations that @entity1 appointees had ordered access lanes to the nation 's biggest river crossing in @entity21 closed last year to punish that town 's mayor politically for not endorsing @entity1 for reelection			2
@entity13 's attorney , @entity25 , wrote on friday that " evidence exists " contradicting @entity1 's recollection about the lane closures at a news conference earlier this month			1
" evidence exists ... tying mr. @entity1 to having knowledge of the lane closures , during the period when the lanes were closed , contrary to what the governor stated publicly in a two - hour press conference ( on january 9 ) , " @entity25 said in a letter to the general counsel of the @entity15 and @entity5 , which operates the bridge and where @entity13 had worked for the governor			1
days of lane closures the letter references the closures over a work week in september , but does not suggest that " evidence " contradicts anything @entity1 has said so far about his advisers at the time or any role they might have played in alleged political shenanigans			1
the letter also does not suggest that @entity1 had any advance knowledge of the closings			2
@entity25 also did n't disclose the evidence			2
@entity55 senior legal analyst @entity54 said @entity25 ' letter is just that			0
" it 's not sworn testimony			0
it 's not proof , " he said			0
read letter from @entity13 's lawyer @entity1 said at the january news conference in @entity65 about the traffic mess that he " had no knowledge of this -- of the planning , the execution or anything about it -- and that i first found out about it after it was over			1
" he also said he had fired a close aide , @entity73 , who e-mails suggest was linked to the closures			0
in addition to @entity13 , two other top christie advisers left their jobs , including the man who ran his two gubernatorial campaigns			0
all have been subpoenaed by a state legislative committee investigating the matter that has called into question @entity1 's swaggering governing style , which has resonated with @entity5 voters and has him as a leading potential candidate for the @entity10 presidential nomination in 2016			1
the @entity89 in @entity5 is also investigating the bridge scandal as well as allegations from the mayor of @entity93 that @entity1 administration officials last year conditioned @entity96 relief funds on her support for a redevelopment project backed by the governor			1
the officials , including lt. gov. @entity101 , deny the assertion			0
governor 's office statement a statement released by the @entity1 administration said the letter written by @entity25 " confirms what the governor has said all along - he had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever mr. @entity13 's motivations were for closing them to begin with			1
" but the statement does n't say whether or not he knew during the week of the lane closures from september 9 - 13 that they had been shut down			1
and a source in @entity1 's office told @entity55 's @entity120 that his advisers had n't yet pinpointed when exactly he learned about the closures -- but stressed that it was after press reports surfaced and it was not before they occurred			1
for his part , @entity1 has given different accounts of when he first learned specifically about the traffic jams , but consistently has said that it was after the lanes were reopened and only after media reports appeared			2
" i think that was the first i heard of it , " @entity1 said at a december news conference about an october 1 @entity133 article			2
" but it was certainly well after the whole thing was over before i heard about it			0
" the @entity1 administration initially said the lane closures were part of a traffic study , which has since been called into question by e-mails suggesting key advisers carried them out			1
@entity21 mayor @entity146 told @entity55 he would love to know " what they mean " specifically about the lane closures , which ended when @entity15 's executive director @entity150 fired off an e-mail on september 13 ordered the lanes reopened			1
" if it 's monday , that 's one thing			0
if it 's friday late morning , that 's another , " @entity146 told @entity55 on friday			0
panel chair not seen documents @entity5 assemblyman @entity158 , who chairs the legislative panel leading the investigation of the bridge scandal , told @entity55 that it has not yet received any documents supporting @entity13 's claim about the timing of when the governor knew about the lane closures			1
" i am concerned as committee co-chair that @entity13 [ @entity25 ] @entity168 is now identifying documents that he has not provided to us , " @entity158 said			0
" i 'd like an explanation as to why they were n't provided before he wrote this letter ( that first appeared in ) the @entity175 , " @entity158 said			0
@entity13 invoked his constitutional right to not testify before the state legislators on the matter earlier this month			0
@entity158 , a @entity179 , said what he read in the @entity13 letter " validates the skepticism that many people have had about the governor 's statements on ( january 9th )			2
a source with knowledge of the investigation said @entity25 is a well - respected attorney in @entity5 who would not likely risk his own credibility on a client like @entity13 if he did n't have documents to back up his carefully worded suggestion			0
@entity25 ' letter also challenged the @entity15 's decision to not pay @entity13 's legal expenses related to the legislative investigation			2
" i would request that you kindly reconsider the @entity15 's decision , " he asked .			0
