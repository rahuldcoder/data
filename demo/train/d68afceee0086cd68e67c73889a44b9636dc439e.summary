-- the @entity2 will collect data about police stops , searches and arrests , aiming to reduce possible effects of racial bias in the justice system , attorney general @entity1 said on monday			1
the agency is launching a new @entity11 and justice , which will focus data - collection on five cities over two years as part of a $ 4.75 million pilot program			0
@entity1 said in a video message the initiative grew from the case of @entity20 , an unarmed @entity21 - @entity21 teenager shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in @entity23 in 2012 and from president @entity24 to improve trust between law enforcement and the minority communities			1
@entity1 has ordered a federal civil rights probe of the racially - charged @entity20 case , which is ongoing			2
@entity1 cited a study that showed the majority of @entity21 men are arrested at least once by age 23 , and that group was six times more likely than white men to be imprisoned			0
the figure for @entity39 men was 2.5 times higher than whites			0
" this overrepresentation of young men of color in our criminal justice system is a problem we must confront â € ” not only as an issue of individual responsibility but also as one of fundamental fairness , and as an issue of effective law enforcement , " @entity1 said			1
" racial disparities contribute to tension in our nation generally and within communities of color specifically , and tend to breed resentment towards law enforcement that is counterproductive to the goal of reducing crime , " he said			2
the five cities to be studied by the @entity2 under the initiative will be announced later .			0

effort stems partly from @entity20 shooting in 2012
