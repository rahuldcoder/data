the agents were convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant and then covering it up			1
president @entity19 issued commutations for both men during his final days in office last month			1
@entity14 and @entity15 had received 11 - and 12 - year prison sentences , respectively			1
after the commutation , their prison sentences were set to end march 20			1
@entity14 was released on furlough to travel from prison in @entity29 , @entity30 , to his home in @entity32 , @entity33 , where he will serve the remaining portion of his sentence under house arrest , said his attorney , @entity37 of @entity38 , @entity33			2
after march 20 , @entity14 will be on " supervised release " -- similar to probation -- for up to three years , @entity37 said			2
@entity15 had been incarcerated in @entity41 , @entity42 , said @entity3 rep. @entity43 , @entity44			2
" at last , @entity14 and @entity15 have been rightfully reunited with their families , " @entity43 said in a statement			1
" this day is long overdue			0
i wish the @entity14 and @entity50 families the best as they now try to pick up the pieces and begin to heal from this terrible ordeal			2
" both men had requested presidential clemency , and the @entity58 's @entity57 was reviewing their requests when @entity19 made his decision , office spokeswoman @entity54 said			1
" the president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they , and their families , have suffered enough for their crimes , " a senior administration official said			2
the official noted that both @entity73 and @entity74 members of @entity75 had supported a commutation , including president @entity78 's chief of staff , @entity79 , and @entity81 sens. @entity80 and @entity82			0
@entity87 inspector general @entity86 , in a statement posted on the agency 's web site , confirmed that his staff wrongly told members of @entity75 last september that @entity15 had stated he " wanted to shoot a @entity90			0
" " at the time my staff made that statement , they believed it to be true , although we later learned it was inaccurate , " @entity86 said			0
" in fact , mr. @entity15 had stated in a sworn statement that ' my intent was to kill the alien ... and i think @entity101 [ @entity14 ] was also trying to kill the alien			1
' " critics of @entity3 immigration policy have been campaigning for a pardon for the two agents , arguing they were just doing their jobs			0
the shooting happened february 17 , 2005 , on the @entity3 - @entity90 border southeast of @entity32 , @entity33			0
during their trial , @entity14 and @entity15 said that the illegal immigrant , @entity112 , had brandished a gun while actively resisting arrest			1
@entity112 said , however , that he was unarmed and trying to surrender when @entity15 attempted to beat him with a shotgun			2
@entity112 was shot while fleeing toward the @entity116			0
@entity14 and @entity15 were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon , lying about the incident and violating @entity112 's @entity120 right against illegal search and seizure			1
after receiving immunity to testify in the case against the two agents , @entity112 was arrested in 2007 on charges of bringing more than 750 pounds of marijuana into the @entity3			0
the case became a political flashpoint , with advocates of tighter border controls defending the agents and civil liberties groups saying that the agents had used illegal and excessive force against @entity112			0
@entity19 granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations during his eight years in office , far fewer than presidents @entity138 and @entity139 in their two - term administrations			1
a commutation reduces a convict 's prison term , but the conviction remains on the person 's record			0
a pardon wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction			0
a president has the sole authority to grant clemency to whomever he chooses , although a @entity58 office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering such standards as a person 's degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release			0
those applying for a pardon through the @entity58 are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement .			0
