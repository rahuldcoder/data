@entity0 remembers exactly what he did a year ago tuesday			1
he ran down fences , drove through fields and over curbs to get his family out of the way of the historic tornado that tattered @entity8 , @entity9			1
the dark gray monster that killed 24 , including 9 children , was in his rear - view mirror , lathing a 17 - mile wound into the landscape that was more than a mile wide in places			1
once it was gone , the @entity16 returned to their hometown just south of @entity19			1
the whirlwind -- an @entity22 tornado , the most destructive on the @entity24 scale -- had sheared houses , schools , businesses into sticks , bricks and shards that lay jumbled and jagged in the straight - line rows of their subdivision streets			1
the @entity16 ' home and everything in it was gone , but something else was on @entity0 's mind -- his neighbors who were missing			2
he and other survivors ran up and down the street			2
" if you can hear me , call out , " he cried to anyone who might have been stuck under rubble and still alive			2
the damage was so complete that when rescuers moved in , city officials raced to print new street signs to help guide them through the apocalyptic landscape			1
a key home improvement a year later , it 's tornado season again , and @entity0 's wife @entity51 seems happy about the new addition to their new home , which is still under construction			2
" we 're gon na build our storm shelter right here kind of between the second and third cars so we can still get in even if there 's cars here , " she said , as a contractor worked inside the incomplete house			2
storm cellars are all the rage in the neighborhood now			2
other homes - in - progress dot the subdivision , where new houses stand surrounded by threadbare lots			1
one bald slab sports a rusty storm cellar door -- apparently the only thing the tornado left standing there			2
nothing else has been added to that empty foundation			0
the terror was too much for some residents , and they are n't rebuilding , because they 're not coming back			0
last year 's cyclone injured 353 of them , and @entity8 is as prime target for twisters , right in the middle of " tornado alley			0
' @entity87 cat and mouse some of them may have recalled the may 1999 tornado that killed dozens in @entity8			1
lt. gov. @entity91 has said it had the strongest wind speeds of any twister in history			0
it was part of a spate of dozens of twisters in tornado alley in just a few days that year			0
or they may remember the 2003 tornado that was less deadly but ripped up buildings			1
or fright may still be in their bones from the tornado that ripped apart another @entity19 outlier last year one day before death visited @entity8 from above			0
and trauma might still be fresh on their minds from the perhaps even bigger monster that missed @entity8 by a hair 11 days after its ravishing -- the so - called @entity115 tornado on may 31 , 2013 , that razed mostly sparsely populated countryside			1
@entity115 was " one of the most powerful tornadoes sampled by mobile radar and also the widest known tornado on record , " the @entity117 said			1
it seems that to live in @entity8 is to play cat and mouse with deadly storms with heart - rending consequences			1
seven of the nine children killed in last year 's tornado died when it flattened one single school building			1
more than 70 students and teachers hunkered down at @entity134 , when the torquing winds pushed walls and ceilings down on top of them			0
@entity140 had no storm shelter a year ago			0
that will change when the school is rebuilt			0
commemorations and a new start remaining @entity8 residents will celebrate their resilience on tuesday with commemorations that start at 10 a.m. local time ( 9 a.m. @entity149 )			1
gov. @entity150 and @entity8 mayor @entity151 will commemorate the dead , as the local fire department tolls a bell in their honor			0
a chaplain will hold a prayer			0
then a shovel will plunge into the dirt for the groundbreaking of the new @entity161			0
a year ago , the tornado tore the old one to pieces and tousled automobiles onto its ruins			0
rescuers were forced to take @entity8 's injured to other hospitals in the region			1
in its place stands a barren empty lot of red earth			0
something new will start to take form there on tuesday			0
honest advice from @entity177 to @entity8 one year later : ' something good 's got ta come out of this '			0

@entity87 killed 9 children and lathed a 17 - mile path into the landscape
the damage was *1.3* miles wide at its largest point
the @entity22 whirlwind sheared houses , schools , businesses into sticks , bricks and shards
deadly , powerful tornadoes come often to that region of the @entity198
