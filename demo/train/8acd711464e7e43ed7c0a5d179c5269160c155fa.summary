@entity0 , @entity1 -- for most , jail may well be an unpleasant experience			1
some facilities are rough and tough places , serving bad food and filled with a whole host of society 's underachievers			2
meanwhile , one @entity1 jail is being sued by one of its inmates who says he 's being tortured -- because he has to watch the same movies over and over again			1
" it 's a lot like @entity19 water torture , " said @entity16			1
in an interview with @entity2 affiliate @entity21 , @entity16 said that the @entity23 's inmates are n't able to watch regular television and are forced to watch the same movies repeatedly			1
movies like wartime epics " @entity27 , " and " @entity28 , " and the holiday classic " @entity30 , " with its boisterous children on a speeding train			2
" i hear those little kids screaming through my brain			0
all night long i can hear them , " @entity16 said " i can close my eyes , but i 'm still going to hear them over and over and over , " he added			0
@entity16 has been at the jail for almost four years now , so it 's not too surprising that he 's seen a couple of the features more than once			1
he 's been there since early 2007 , when he was charged in a @entity44 crash that killed his female passenger			2
@entity16 should have been at the jail only a short time , but he 's filed 15 court motions for continuances , which have delayed his trial			1
he 's also filed six lawsuits against the jail			1
all the previous lawsuits have been dismissed except one in which he demands access to newspapers and publications			0
" we 're not preventing him from receiving any material , " said commander @entity58 of the @entity0			0
" he just has to get a subscription and pay for it , " she told @entity2			0
but magazines and newspapers are taking a back seat to @entity16 's complaints in a new lawsuit that he has to watch the same movies again and again			1
@entity58 says that tough economic times have affected the jail 's budget , just like they 've affected most people 's budgets			1
when the broadcast networks switched over to digital technology , the jail would have been forced to purchase new tv equipment			1
as a savings move , the jail decided to keep its old tvs and dvd players , thereby losing the ability to get tv channels			1
" we decided to do things more constructively , " said @entity58			0
jail officials restructured their program to offer more educational dvds , as a way to help the inmates			1
" we try to keep them informed , and provide something that could keep them from getting @entity94 or hepatitis ...			0
instead of watching @entity96 , " said @entity58			0
@entity58 says that historical dvds are often followed by movies about the period			2
so , movies like " @entity27 , and " @entity28 , " have gotten some play			0
but that does n't appear to be good enough for @entity16			0
it seems he does n't necessarily have to have his @entity105 , but he does crave just plain tv			2
" the jail has the necessary equipment already to go ahead and give us regular tv , " he said			2
" we have a right to the media in jail , " he said			0
jail officials say that in the time that live tv access has been gone from the jail , inmate - on - inmate violence is way down			1
" there are families that do n't even have cable tv			1
we ca n't bring it in for his ( @entity16 's ) benefit , at the taxpayers ' expense , " said @entity58			2
" he does n't have to watch it , " she said of the movies programming			2
" he can go in his room and close the door			0
he can read a book			0
no one forces him to watch			0
" " when you have someone here as long as him , he is going to see a rerun			0

a @entity1 jail inmate says watching the jail 's few movies over and over is " torture "
jail officials say they do n't have cable tv for cost reasons , but they do have movies and dvds
the inmate wants to take it to court
he 's been at the jail nearly four years after filing 15 court motions delaying his trial
