-- @entity2 boss @entity1 insists he should not have been sacked by @entity3 , stoking the tension ahead of tuesday night 's @entity5 last - 16 tie in @entity7			1
@entity8 champions @entity2 hold a 2 - 1 lead after winning the first leg in the @entity11 , with @entity1 making an emotional return to the club where he is still adored by fans after winning two @entity16 titles despite his acrimonious departure in 2007			1
the @entity19 coach was axed by @entity3 's billionaire @entity21 owner @entity20 just two months into the season following a disappointing 1 - 1 draw with @entity25 club @entity24 in the @entity5			1
he led @entity2 to the @entity27 title in his first year in charge and the @entity30 top the @entity8 table again this season , though their lead has been cut to one point following friday 's shock defeat by @entity35			1
blog : @entity37 need @entity1 's magic @entity3 , meanwhile , have won only the @entity39 since his departure , with his replacement @entity42 and then @entity43 being sacked before current manager @entity44 took over from interim boss @entity45 in july 2009			1
" i feel sorry but i look forward			0
i feel sorry because , when i look at the big four teams while i was in @entity48 , [ their managers ] are all there , " @entity1 told reporters on monday			2
" sir @entity51 is here			0
i did more than enough to be here			0
but the decision was made			0
i keep winning important things			2
they keep winning ... something			2
" the most important thing is the relation we have			0
no regrets , no big problems			0
in football , coming back to an old team , it 's important to feel like i feel			2
it 's one of the most beautiful things in football			2
they move on , i move on			0
" however , the 47 - year - old admitted having one regret about his time at @entity74 -- he would have preferred to leave on his own terms after winning the @entity39 in may 2007			1
" i would have left the day after the @entity39 final after my third season			0
i waited three or four more months more and , after that , i left in september and i did n't enjoy my time from then to the day i went to @entity2 , " he said			2
" for me , being away from football is too painful			0
if i had left @entity3 in may , i would have started the next season in a new club and i would not have been without football for six or seven months			1
" @entity1 , who won the @entity5 in 2004 before joining @entity3 , said he still wishes to return to @entity48 in the future			1
" i have , as i said before , three things to do in my career			0
one is to come back to @entity48 football , another thing is to win the @entity89 championship , because no - one has won @entity8 , @entity48 and @entity89 titles			1
and another one , when i 'm old , is to coach my national team			0
but , for now , i would like to keep winning with @entity2			1
" @entity1 has had a difficult relationship with the @entity8 media since taking over from @entity96 , now manager of @entity48 club @entity97 , and he has now come under more pressure following his latest falling - out with young striker @entity100			1
the 19 - year - old , who was dropped by @entity1 for a month last season for reportedly not training hard enough , did not make the trip to @entity48 after missing the @entity35 game			1
media reports claimed that the highly - rated @entity100 argued with @entity1 following a below - par performance in the previous game against @entity109 , a 0 - 0 draw , claiming that he was ill. " i do n't want to talk about him , " @entity1 said			2
" he wo n't be here			0
he wo n't be at the match			0
" i can explain whey i called up the other 20 players			0
it 's more important to talk about the players who will be there , not those that are not			0
" @entity89 club @entity121 host @entity119 in tuesday night 's other @entity5 match			1
the two teams drew 1 - 1 in the first leg in @entity125 last month .			1
