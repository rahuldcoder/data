government and politics teacher @entity1 ' voice goes tight with frustration when she thinks back to how trying to register her students to vote thrust her into the center of @entity9 's high profile and deeply partisan voting rights controversy			1
" i never felt like the voting process was on my side ... that 's not the way it 's supposed to be , " said @entity1 , a registered @entity12 who was slapped with a $ 1,000 fine when she ran afoul of a state law requiring a 48 - hour deadline for third parties to turn in voter registration forms			1
" i felt like i was taking on my own party , " she said			0
though a federal judge recently struck down the 48 - hour deadline requirement , @entity24 and other @entity25 have been stunned by the state 's standoff with the federal government over voter registration laws			1
for some @entity9 voters , 2012 is starting to feel eerily like 2000			1
twelve years ago , the fate of the presidency hung in the balance as @entity9 elections officials scurried to recount ballots to determine whether @entity12 candidate @entity36 or vice president @entity37 , a @entity38 , would emerge as victor from the close contest			1
in the electoral chaos that followed , a number of minority voters said they were turned away from the polls or not provided language assistance , a matter that leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of the state 's civil rights activists to this day			1
the matter of who won the 2000 presidential election was ultimately decided by the @entity54			2
and @entity9 , a battleground state with a history of voting irregularities , cemented its reputation as a place where electorally things sometimes go awry			1
on tuesday the @entity60 filed a lawsuit to keep @entity9 from potentially purging thousands of voters from its registration rolls			2
@entity9 gov. @entity64 has said the purge — which comes months before the general election — was both legal and necessary to keep non- @entity68 citizens from voting illegally			1
@entity9 is suing the @entity69 to gain access to a citizenship database and blames the agency for the election year timing of the purge			1
" had they not stonewalled us , we could have easily identified non-citizens , removed them from the voter rolls , and the issue would n't be what it is today , " said @entity75 , a @entity64 spokesman			0
so far , the state has identified " almost 100 individuals " who are n't citizens but are registered to vote			0
state officials also say they " are not aware of any eligible voter who has been removed through this process ; we are only aware of ineligible voters on the list , " said @entity91 , spokesman for the @entity9 @entity92			1
however voters on those lists tell a different tale			0
@entity96 , who is originally from the @entity97 , became a citizen a few years ago			0
getting her citizenship and registering as a @entity12 was a big day for her and her family			0
so they were shocked to find her name on the list of voters who could potentially be purged from @entity9 's rolls			1
" we did everything that we were supposed to do properly ... she aced her exam on questions of @entity68 law and history and everything , " said her husband , @entity108			0
@entity96 declined to speak with @entity115			0
" if she 's already a citizen , why does she have to go out and then reprove that she 's a citizen to bureaucrats that are not researching properly , " her husband asked			0
the state also has tussled with voting rights groups including the @entity122 , the @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 over the controversial 48 - hour deadline requirement to turn in registration forms			1
" it just seems as if the train has gone off the tracks , " said @entity129 , president of the @entity122 of @entity9			2
" the lack of justification of these laws			0
it 's an extraordinary movement toward disenfranchisement of these voters			0
it 's shocking in a state that has had a history of voter suppression			1
" @entity9 's efforts to crack down on illegal voting through strict new laws are part of a national trend			1
thirty - two states have put in place varying degrees of voter identification laws , according to the @entity152			2
some of the states that have the most stringent requirements are also states that have seen an increase in their minority population			0
@entity9 has the nation 's third largest @entity160 population			2
it is also a deeply partisan state where " the @entity12 have made a concerted effort to try and limit turnout by @entity167 - leaning voters , " said @entity115 legal analyst @entity168 " after the midterm elections in 2010 , lots of @entity12 - leaning states passed efforts to limit voting , " @entity168 said			2
" what 's particularly noticeable is the effort in @entity9 because the state has such a history in this area			1
" state officials say they welcome the spotlight and stand by the purge			2
" there is naturally going to be more scrutiny of a state the size of @entity9 which has such a significant influence on national politics , " @entity182 said			2
" but we hold ourselves to a high standard and expect @entity25 to hold us to a high standard , as well , because we recognize how important it is to have fair elections			0
" in the meantime , voters like @entity24 are waiting to see if the 2012 elections are a déjà vu			0
" i agree with folks wanting to clean up the voter rosters , " @entity1 said			0
" but being skeptical the way i am , i want to see who is picking and choosing whose getting kicked off			0

2000 cemented @entity9 's reputation as a place where elections sometimes go awry
voting rights groups and @entity9 elections officials are *facing* off over strict new laws
political experts say partisanship at play in state 's voter purge
