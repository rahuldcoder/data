@entity0 , @entity1 -- not all of the earthquake - traumatized @entity6 are receiving the aid they need , a @entity4 general said thursday , partly because displaced residents are moving from place to place			1
" we 're still not up to meeting the needs of the @entity6 people as far as the amount of supplies that are there			1
and so , there have been some instances , isolated , where we 've been out to give distribution to citizens , there has n't always been enough food , " said @entity18 gen. @entity17 , head of the @entity0 - based @entity4 @entity19			1
he added : " we have n't anticipated the demand , i guess , at each site as we 've gone out because the @entity6 have -- have migrated around , if you will , from distribution site to distribution site , so we 're finding pockets that we have n't been able to get in to			1
" he said the distribution is inconsistent , however , because there are areas where fresh fruit and plenty of food are available			2
" the need keeps moving around a little bit , " @entity17 said			1
" that 's an evolving issue			2
" @entity40 : @entity6 's missing and found full coverage another problem has been damage to the south pier of the port in @entity47 , which is reducing the number of containers that can be unloaded there , @entity17 said			1
the pier was damaged by new tremors on wednesday			2
the @entity54 will expand its distribution points in @entity47 from 12 to 15 on friday , the general said			1
there are hundreds of camps for displaced persons in the capital and surrounding areas following the devastating january 12 earthquake			1
@entity17 said from 800,000 to about 1 million @entity6 have lost their homes			1
he said there was tremendous support from the international community , and " the relief efforts improve every day			2
" one of the most popular items distributed recently is hand - cranked radios			2
@entity17 gave the report on the relief effort to @entity72 reporters via teleconference			1
he said one of the most pressing needs was a place for patients in recovery , and that problem was being worked on			2
girl , 16 , rescued in @entity6 when was asked how much the @entity4 military effort was costing , he said he did n't know			1
" i do n't have an accurate assessment of the cost , primarily because it involves many parts of the @entity72 , " he said			0
he added president @entity85 and secretary of defense @entity86 have said they will fund whatever he says is needed			0
however , there appeared to be a somewhat different message wednesday from @entity72 spokesman @entity90			0
when he was asked how much the @entity6 operation was costing , he seemed to indicate that cost is now becoming a factor			1
" you know , i think we 're still working that			0
but i mean , you know , we 've got 24 ships out there			0
you 've got 15,000 personnel			0
this is a -- this is a very expensive operation			0
" we have committed enormous capabilities towards this mission , and the meter is running			0
and so i do n't know that we 've gotten arms quite yet around how much , but -- you know , probably hundreds of millions of dollars			0
" as the general was making his comments , the @entity110 was discussing the enormity of the task of rebuilding @entity47 , given the devastation			1
" you have to have so many parts to coordinate , " said sen. @entity116 , @entity117 , who chairs the committee			0
" and you 've got to come in there with a new city planning concept			0
you 've got to have a vision for what you want this place to look like			0
" i do n't see any entity at this point or movement ... that suggests to me the global community is coming together around that organizational effort the way that it ought to , " @entity116 said			0
@entity132 , the @entity133 deputy special envoy for @entity6 , testified that he agreed			1
" this task is so massive that we need the ' international a-team ' working on this case , " @entity134 said			0
@entity116 said he believed the project could be pulled together to empower @entity6 , and " we 're going to press this concept			2
" @entity2 's @entity141 contributed to this report .			0
