-- red wine in moderation has been shown to reduce the risks of heart disease			2
enjoy a glass with dinner tonight			0
those words accord with the best available medical knowledge			0
when i write them here , i am protected by the @entity11			0
if , however , a winemaker were to include those words on a wine label , that winemaker would find itself in serious legal trouble			1
fortunately , most of us have a pretty good idea of the health risks and benefits of wine			1
but when it comes to other important health - affecting products , we depend on doctors , and they , in turn , depend on medical researchers			1
the free flow of information among medical researchers is regulated very nearly as tightly as advertising by winemakers but by a different government agency : the @entity34			1
the @entity34 tells pharmaceutical companies what they may say about their products			1
any use of the drugs must be approved by the @entity34 before companies can recommend that use			1
they are forbidden to mention anything beyond that			0
up until last week anyway			0
last week , the @entity45 decided a case ( @entity47 ) that could that could dramatically expand the free - speech rights of pharmaceutical companies , allowing them to share unapproved information about the drugs they make			1
the case involved a salesman who talked too much			2
@entity56 worked as a sales representative for @entity58 , now called @entity59 , the company that makes @entity60 , a drug approved to treat a severe version of the sleep disorder narcolepsy			1
this is a rare condition , and the market for @entity60 was small , about $ 20 million a year in 2005			0
@entity56 's job was to promote the use of @entity60 to physicians			2
he seems not to have been very successful at it			0
in 2005 , the federal government began an investigation into @entity72 for illegally promoting the drug for uses unapproved by the @entity75			1
he was recorded saying that @entity60 could be used on patients under age 16 , unapproved by the @entity34			1
@entity56 also suggested that @entity60 could be used to treat fibromyalgia , ditto unapproved			0
he finally suggested that the drug could be used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness , a use unapproved at the time but approved later			1
@entity56 and an associate were sentenced to a year 's probation			2
all @entity56 did was to speak			0
one of his claims was corroborated later by the @entity34 itself			1
the @entity34 made no contention that any of his other claims were false or misleading			1
he was punished not for speaking fraudulently but for speaking without permission			0
other people are allowed to speak about off - label use of drugs			1
if you take aspirin for your heart , but have not had a previous heart attack , you are engaged in an off - label use of drugs right now : @entity34 - approved labels only mention aspirin as a remedy against recurrent heart trouble			1
yet many doctors recommend aspirin as a prophylactic for everyone at risk of heart disease			2
doctors freely debate this issue			2
the only people forbidden to join the discussion are the companies who actually make aspirin			0
@entity56 's words became a crime only because he happened to be an employee of the company that made @entity60			0
how , @entity56 and his employer asked , can that be constitutional ? on december 3 , a 2 - to - 1 majority of the @entity45 agreed with @entity56 and @entity59 : it 's not			1
the court said , " the government can not prosecute pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives ... for speech promoting the lawful , off - label use of an @entity34 - approved drug			1
" this is big , big news for the drug industry			0
the ban on discussion of " off - label " uses of medicine is based on a binary vision of how medicines operate			1
in this vision , any potential use of a drug is either " safe and effective " or not " safe and effective			0
" until the @entity34 says yes , the answer must be no. the trouble is , that vision does not describe the real world very well			1
rather than fit into clearly defined categories of " effective " or " not effective , " the value of drugs often blurs across a spectrum			0
a friend who thinks profoundly about these issues calls pharmaceuticals " useful poisons			0
" they always come with harms attached			0
the harms and benefits are always uncertain			0
for example , @entity34 - approved advertising will recommend aspirin only for those who have had one heart attack already , but many doctors recommend aspirin prophylactically for people at risk for a first attack			1
the @entity34 applies bright line rules , backed by criminal penalties , to an area of science where the lines are not bright at all			2
there 's no mystery to the evil @entity34 seeks to prevent			1
it 's well - described by the dissent in the @entity72 case			2
" hardware stores are generally free to sell bottles of turpentine , but may not label those bottles , ' @entity182 : there is no sore it will not heal ; no pain it will not subdue , ' " the judge wrote			2
@entity193 's @entity182 was one of the very first products shut down by the @entity196 in the early 20th century			0
but in trying to protect the public from flim - flam , the @entity34 also risks depriving doctors of early notice of information that could treat and cure their patients			1
the irony is that the law allows " all - natural food supplements " to make all kinds of wild promises : they 're subject to a different and much more permissive regulatory scheme			0
you 'll hear radio ads for " supplements " that tout these products as " so effective , clinical trials have already begun			0
" yet for pharmaceutical products , even the news that a clinical trial has been completed was , until this week , forbidden speech unless the @entity34 gave the word			1
that rule has abruptly changed			0
you 're going to hear more talk about what scientists think medicines might be able to do			0
where the side effects of a medicine are high , and where good alternatives are available , doctors and patients will want to exercise caution until the final experiments conclude			2
but where alternatives do not exist , where something is better than nothing , the @entity72 ruling offers hope for a more transparent drug - approval regime			1
nothing is certain until the @entity240 weighs in			0
but it 's looking likelier that freer speech is coming to @entity244 medicine			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			2

@entity247 : court ruling may dramatically open drug companies ' free speech rights
drug salesman *convicted* of promoting uses not approved by @entity34 for a legal drug
@entity257 : but doctors often use drugs " off - label " ; court said it 's free speech to discuss
by trying to protect public , he says , @entity34 risks depriving doctors of good information
