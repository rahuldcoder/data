-- when @entity2 announced its cloud - based @entity4 laptop , the tech community was left puzzled			1
they could n't put a little category box around the @entity4 , so they began berating the only thing they could : the software			1
but sometimes a new product comes along that represents a major shift in how we have learned to do things			0
@entity2 loaned me a pixel for this review , and i liked it so much that after i returned the review model i purchased my own			0
i 've been using it for more than a month , but it only takes turning the computer on once to realize how different it is from anything else out there			2
first , though , some background : @entity2 's @entity26 are built on the promise of cloud computing , where your files live not on your hard drive but on web servers			1
everything you upload is just a click away if you want it to be			0
the files do n't physically have to be in the same location as the worker			0
more and more people are embracing the cloud , not just at work , but on their personal machines , too			2
they upload all sorts of files , accessible anywhere			0
within the last two years , @entity2 has started selling these affordable computers that run an operating system called @entity49 @entity49 , and its open - source sibling , @entity51 , are @entity2 's answer to the desktop computer			1
built for the cloud , they run through a combination of the @entity49 browser and web apps			2
up to now , the computers have been inexpensive and fast			0
but @entity2 has done something unexpected with the new @entity4			1
this new computer is still very much a @entity4 , but it boasts sturdy , @entity62 - like aluminium unibody design			1
it also has a gorgeous touchscreen that demands to be seen and touched			1
you can interact with all your content with just a swipe of your finger			0
after the computer boots up , simply log into your @entity2 account and all your apps , e-mail , calendar appointments and contacts load instantly			2
@entity2 has created a seductive app launcher , sort of like how @entity62 operates with its @entity77 suite but still unique			1
instead of a physical computer dictating how you do what you do , the @entity4 is offering you a way to work and connect that requires only your username and password			1
let 's jump right into some of my favorite features : -- trackpad			0
it 's the best i have ever used			0
it is fluid and responsive and in my opinion , better than the @entity94 trackpads i 've used in the past			0
it is not too firm but not too mushy , as i have experienced on some @entity62 laptops			1
depressing a key on the chiclet - style keyboard produces just the right amount of pushback			2
i have found that the action of the keys is just stiff enough to prevent accidental bumping of other keys while your hands move across the keyboard			2
the resolution on the screen , my favorite feature , is simply amazing , although it 's more than just the crispness of the screen			0
the way it renders colors is completely unique			0
i have used @entity119 " laptops before , but i prefer the color of the @entity4 's display , which appear warmer and more alive			1
the screen 's viewing angles are wide and have very little glare -- perfect for viewing in a group setting			0
now here are three features i do n't like so much : -- @entity128			0
i am usually plugged into a wall socket for power , but on the rare chance i venture out without the charger ; i 'm disappointed how quickly the battery gets to red			1
i wonder if there is a software update that can do some improvement on power management of the battery ? -- charging port			0
it can sometimes get unhinged from the computer by the tiniest accidental pull of the wire			0
i wish the computer held the power cord a little more snugly so i would not have to keep plugging it back in			0
i do n't usually hear the fan running unless i have a lot of windows open on my screen or am watching a hi - def video			2
but the @entity4 's fan can get spinning very fast and loud			1
i wonder if a software update would be able correct this when the fan speed switches to hyper - drive			2
still , on balance the @entity4 is a fine machine			2
the computer is very quick , thanks to a beefy processor and the fact that most tasks are done via apps online			0
its @entity49 has a history of being secure ( although cloud computing will never be as protected as a local personal hard - drive )			1
earlier this year @entity2 held a competitive hackathon and offered $ 3.14 million in prize money if anyone could infiltrate @entity49			0
if you 're looking for a speedy , sturdy machine and are comfortable living in the cloud , the @entity4 may be for you			1
overall i found this computer to be a refreshing approach to computing in the cloud , thanks to its hi - def screen and wicked fast computing power			1
my month with the @entity4 thoroughly changed my thinking on how a computer should behave while handling my files			1
with the @entity4 , i 'm totally on cloud nine			1
what 's been your experience with the @entity4 ? or are you considering buying one ? let us know in the comments below .			2

the new @entity4 boasts sturdy , @entity62 - like aluminum unibody design
