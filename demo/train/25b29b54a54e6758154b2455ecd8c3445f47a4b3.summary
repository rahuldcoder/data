@entity1 , @entity0 -- when the 10th @entity4 opens this week , @entity3 will have greater access to films made in the @entity8 territories than many people living in the region			1
@entity8 director @entity12 's first feature film , " @entity11 , " premiered at @entity13 in 2008			1
today , there is only one movie theater operating in the @entity16			0
the " @entity21 " theater in @entity20 is the only formal film venue for a population of nearly 2.5 million in the @entity16			0
due to travel restrictions it is virtually inaccessible to the one and one half million @entity8 residing in @entity17			1
it is estimated that about 80 percent of @entity8 children have never been to a movie theater , according to a report in the @entity30			0
with this lack of distribution , and hardly any formal funding available , producing a film within the @entity8 territories is a tremendous challenge			1
against the odds , the region 's filmmakers completed three feature films and an estimated eight shorts in 2008 -- more than ever before			1
local directors are determined to tell their stories and have adapted to cope with the region 's difficult circumstances			0
lack of cinematic infrastructure one of the greatest obstacles filmmakers face is a lack of equipment and crews			0
according to industry experts , directors in the @entity8 territories have little hope of competing with international news media over the limited resources			1
" crews who can work for international news organizations at very high salaries do n't want to work for independent film makers , " says director and coordinator of the @entity60 's @entity59 , @entity61			2
are you interested in seeing more films made by @entity8 directors ? tell us below in the @entity71 box below " they do n't want to rent their equipment out for a 10 - hour shooting day , when they can rent it out for just two hours and triple the price to an international crew			1
" as a consequence of this , filmmakers are looking to local residents for production assistance			0
@entity12 's first feature film , " @entity11 , " which premiered last year at @entity13 , tells the story of an @entity86 woman who travels to @entity87 to visit the land where her grandfather lived before @entity8 were ejected in 1948			1
the film was shot with a crew consisting largely of novices assembled by the director , including a former ambulance driver , a jeweler and a radio dj. " there were always discussions with my producers , who preferred bringing more experienced professional people from @entity101 in , and i insisted that i 'd rather have locals even if they 're less experienced , " @entity12 told @entity2			1
" we 're trying to build something in [ the @entity8 territories ] , and when things got tough , because they believed in what we were doing , they stayed			1
" during the shoot @entity12 's team also received unexpected support from members of the local community , who brought them food and drinks in between takes			1
" we even had the entire @entity8 police force blocking traffic ; going out of their way to help us , " remembers @entity12			2
restricted mobility a further complication faced by @entity12 and her colleagues is the limitation on movement and access in the @entity8 territories			1
since @entity87 's occupation of the @entity16 and @entity17 in 1967 , @entity87 authorities have imposed varying degrees of restriction on the movement of people in and out of the territories , according to human rights group , @entity132			0
in 2007 , the year in which @entity12 shot the majority of her film , @entity132 reported 84 manned checkpoints and 465 unmanned blockades within the @entity16 alone			2
as a result of these security measures , which the @entity87 say are necessary to secure their country from @entity8 attacks , the production of " @entity11 , " a movie with over 80 shooting locations was logistically very complex			2
in order to shoot the road movie lawfully , @entity12 and her crew had to apply for permission to leave @entity20			0
" every single crew member was rejected			0
so , just purely getting through the checkpoints and the logistics of keeping a film crew together was an obstacle			0
" obtaining shooting permission was equally problematic			0
permits for various locations including @entity157 were refused repeatedly -- a hindrance which did not deter @entity12			2
" in some cases we just filmed anyway			0
we put the actors in a real situation and we just did it guerrilla - style			0
that 's how most @entity8 filmmakers are managing to do their work , " she told @entity2			2
a bright future ? while drawbacks such as a lack of funding , a lack of resources , and restrictions of movement would dissuade directors in many other countries , members of the growing film community in the @entity8 territories are forging bonds over the difficulties			1
while @entity183 and @entity12 agree that it would be going too far to speak of a " national cinema " at this stage , they look to the future with great optimism			0
the novice crew members @entity12 recruited to work on " @entity11 " have continued to find work in filmmaking -- a fact @entity12 believes indicates an industry is gradually starting to emerge			1
" i think there 's a wave coming -- a lot of new filmmakers , a lot of people making documentaries and more experimental films , working together , " @entity12 told @entity2			1
@entity183 , whose @entity202 festival will enter its fifth year this fall , is equally hopeful			0
" the fact that we , under the harshest of conditions in the @entity207 world , have been able to hold an annual women 's film festival , and that hundreds of students come to our screenings means that people want their worlds to be expanded , " she said			2
" they want wider horizons , and i think for me , this is what makes it possible to go on in the context that we live in			0

more films were made in the @entity8 territories in 2008 then ever before
filmmakers must *overcome* problems like travel restrictions and poor distribution
director @entity12 's film " @entity11 " showed at @entity13 in 2008
@entity12 : " i think there 's a wave coming -- a lot of new filmmakers "
