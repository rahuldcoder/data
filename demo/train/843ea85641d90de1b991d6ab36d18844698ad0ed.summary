-- @entity2 's president has spoken out against @entity4 's military incursion into his country , saying his nation 's @entity7 neighbor has overstepped its bounds by pursuing @entity11 militants beyond its borders			1
@entity2 president @entity13 said monday that the strike degrades the trust built up between the two countries over the past few decades , and called @entity4 's actions " not good			1
" his comments contradict a joint @entity2 - @entity4 communique issued three days after the @entity4 incursion			1
in that statement , both countries declared the @entity11 extremist group @entity27 " a common enemy to both countries " and pledged to work together to stabilize @entity2 and cooperate in security and military operations			1
@entity4 forces entered @entity2 on october 15 in a strike on @entity27 , a @entity2 militant group that @entity4 blames for the recent kidnappings of foreigners from northern @entity4			1
the @entity4 forces are ultimately seeking to take the @entity2 port city of @entity33 , described by the @entity34 as a key stronghold and source of cash for @entity27			1
the @entity34 estimates the group collects up to $ 50 million a year from businesses in @entity33 , about half of its annual income			2
@entity2 's frail @entity42 , aided by forces from the @entity44 , has itself been fighting @entity27 militants in the capital , @entity47 , and reported last week that they had largely pushed the group out of that city			1
on monday , the state - run @entity50 reported that @entity4 troops were gearing up for an assault of @entity53 in south central @entity2 , a key location in the effort to capture @entity33			1
@entity4 forces had pushed 35 kilometers ( about 22 miles ) north into @entity2 as of monday , @entity50 reported , and were conducting aerial assaults against @entity27 positions in @entity33			1
@entity4 officials declared self - defense justifies crossing the border with @entity2 , saying the recent spate of kidnappings threatened its security and constituted an attack			2
" if you are attacked by an enemy , you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try ( to ) hit wherever that enemy is , " @entity4 defense minister @entity65 said in a news conference sunday			2
@entity27 warned @entity4 that it would face repercussions if it did not withdraw its troops immediately			2
days later , twin explosions in @entity75 killed at least one person			0
in response to suggestions that the @entity81 might be aiding the @entity4 assault , a @entity78 spokesman said monday that it is not providing any advice or assistance to @entity4			0
@entity86 , a @entity87 spokeswoman , reiterated that point tuesday , saying , " the @entity81 is not participating in @entity4 's current operation in @entity2			2
" the kidnappings that sparked the @entity4 attack raised the ire of @entity4 and @entity93 alike			0
on september 11 , armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where @entity97 @entity96 and @entity98 , both in their 50s , were staying			0
@entity98 was shot dead while trying to resist the attack			0
his wife was grabbed and spirited away aboard the pirates ' speedboat			0
she is believed to have been taken into @entity2			0
on october 1 , pirates made another cross-border raid , this time snatching a @entity106 woman in her 60s from the holiday home on @entity109 , where she lived for part of the year			0
that woman , @entity111 , reportedly died after her capture			0
and last week , gunmen abducted two @entity114 working for the medical charity @entity115 ( @entity115 ) from the @entity117 refugee complex , about 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) from the @entity2 border .			0

the @entity2 president calls @entity4 's incursion to chase down a militant group " not good "
his statement contradicts a joint statement issued by @entity2 and @entity4 days after the move
in the statement , the countries called @entity27 a " common enemy "
@entity4 troops are *preparing* to battle for a key city on their way to the port of @entity33
