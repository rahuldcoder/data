@entity0 -- it 's been a bad month for @entity4 conservative politicians who ca n't seem to resist the temptation to rewrite history and make provocative gestures while shifting and minimizing war responsibility			1
@entity9 , prime minister @entity10 's overworked spokesman , has been in damage control mode , issuing numerous denials while restating and reinterpreting controversial statements			1
@entity10 is feeling confident as polls show strong public support , mostly because he has ignited the stock market with massive quantitative easing			0
now he is showing his true ideological colors and galvanizing his base by recanting on apologies and war guilt			0
but can his slick pr machine repair the damage inflicted on @entity4 's reputation and credibility ? history matters because @entity4 has made it into an issue that further antagonizes @entity29 and @entity30 at a time when @entity4 would like their cooperation in dealing with the @entity35 threat			1
trampling on the neighbors ' sensitivities about their shared past also limits room for managing territorial disputes involving both countries or making headway on a range of other pressing issues			0
war responsibility also matters because conservative loudmouths tarnish the national reputation by backtracking on previous apologies and muddying the waters on what exactly @entity4 acknowledges about its wartime excesses			1
the @entity53 @entity52 recently criticized abe - history for roiling regional relations in ways detrimental to @entity53 interests			0
ironically , @entity10 promised to improve relations with @entity60 during last year 's lower house election campaign , but just as in 2007 when he quibbled about the extent of coercion used in recruiting so - called " comfort women , " he is undermining bilateral ties			2
given heightened regional tensions , it seems absurd that @entity10 and other conservatives are seeking dignity in denial and implying that @entity4 aggression was justifiable and not a colossal catastrophe			2
the " dr. @entity77 " of @entity4 history who embrace an exonerating and validating narrative of @entity4 's @entity83 rampage 1931 - 45 do a great disservice to their country			1
they are embedded in the political mainstream and dominate the @entity10 cabinet , but their retrograde views on history are not supported by public opinion			0
@entity10 has long championed a beautifying of @entity4 's history inconsistent with established facts and seeks to promote patriotic education			1
there is much that @entity4 can be proud of since 1945 -- rapid recovery from war devastation , adopting a pacifist @entity97 , the economic miracle , achieving the best living standards in the region , creating a robust democracy in a relatively egalitarian society , and promoting regional economic development through massive aid and technical cooperation			2
but conservatives seek to vindicate @entity4 's imperial aggression and pretend that it was really about liberating @entity83 from the yoke of @entity109 colonialism			1
@entity4 historians have exposed this as a sham , pointing out that prime minister @entity114 's ( 1941 - 44 ) wartime diary emphasized the need for ousting the colonial powers , not to liberate them but in order to seize @entity83 resources to win the ongoing war aimed at subjugating @entity29			1
towards the end of april , three cabinet ministers , including deputy prime minister @entity121 , visited the @entity123 , the talismanic ground zero for a valorizing view of @entity4 aggression that is fully displayed at the adjacent @entity127			2
soon after , a phalanx of 168 @entity130 lawmakers also genuflected at this sacred space of unrepentant imperialism			0
subsequently @entity10 quibbled in the @entity4 parliament remarks about how to define " aggression , " and in doing so subverted the 1995 @entity134 that expresses regret for @entity4 's colonial rule and aggression			1
on may 10 , spokesman @entity9 sought to douse the brushfires by insisting that @entity10 has never denied @entity4 's history of aggression and unequivocally supports the @entity134			1
this wink - and - nod approach to history may be politically expedient , but is unconvincing and inevitably puts @entity4 back on the defensive because the government looks like it is shirking			2
and history is the gift that keeps on giving as the @entity130 policy chief @entity144 , appearing on television on may 12 , told viewers that in fact @entity10 does n't accept the verdict of the @entity149 , again denied by @entity9 , while she also slammed the @entity134			0
then it was the turn of @entity153 's outspoken mayor			0
@entity154 courted controversy when he suggested that the " comfort women , " tens of thousands of teenage girls mostly from the @entity157 forced into providing sexual services for @entity4 soldiers between 1931 - 45 , offered a " necessary service " by helping battle - stressed soldiers relax and thereby maintain discipline in the ranks			1
he also revealed that he advised top brass in the @entity53 military that @entity53 soldiers stationed in @entity168 should visit local sex shops more often as a way to reduce sex crimes			0
in his view , the ban on @entity53 personnel visiting adult entertainment facilities discriminates against women legally working in the business			0
@entity154 's remarks portray the comfort women system as a necessary evil , flouting the contrition expressed in the 1993 @entity182			0
perhaps he hopes to revive the flagging fortunes of his @entity184 ? co-leader @entity185 , the main instigator in provoking @entity186 over the @entity188 / @entity188 dispute , defended @entity154 's controversial comments			2
when they launched their party in 2012 it generated a big buzz , winning 57 seats in the @entity195 , but recent polls suggest tepid voter interest			0
it 's not immediately clear which constituency @entity154 is targeting with his recent outbursts since the @entity130 has a lock on jingoists			2
his remarks will also not appeal to women voters who have largely shunned the party			0
nearly 68 years after surrender , some @entity4 conservatives are engaged in counterproductive battles over history that make @entity4 appear weak and undignified , unable to take the measure of its history			2
this is not about convincing the world about @entity4 's innocence			1
this is a longstanding internecine battle that has animated post-wwii @entity4 politics , one that has already been lost in the court of domestic public opinion and in the research conducted by @entity4 's professional historians			1
@entity4 's recalcitrant conservatives are playing with fire and surely @entity10 recalls that when he was hounded from office in 2007 the denouement began when he tried to revise history			1
perhaps stoking tensions abroad is his agenda as he rallies domestic support for remaking @entity4 by revising its pacifist @entity97			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			0

recent comments from a nationalist politician suggested @entity239 sex slaves were necessary
@entity242 's spokesman forced to issue numerous denials , *clarifications* of controversial statements
@entity247 : conservative loudmouths tarnish @entity4 's reputation by backtracking on apologies
such behavior risks antagonizing already strained relations with @entity4 's neighbors
