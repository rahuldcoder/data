-- does anyone really want to be @entity3 's teammate at @entity4 ? okay , it wo n't be like it was with @entity7 between 1996 and 2006 when he was the undisputed number one in the team , but whoever ends up there will be playing -- at best -- second fiddle			1
perhaps that 's one of the reasons why @entity15 , who was touted as a possible @entity4 driver , has signed up to race alongside two - time @entity19 champion @entity18 for another year at @entity20			1
@entity15 led for much of the 2010 world championship only to lose out to @entity18 at the season 's end , but last year he was completely overshadowed : one win to the @entity25 's 11 , and that came in the final grand prix when his younger teammate had a gearbox problem and let him through			1
this year , though , he 's had the measure of @entity18 -- he 's 16 points ahead in second place overall after heading off @entity3 and @entity18 to win the @entity34 @entity33 , and he 's arguably getting on better with this year 's @entity20			1
@entity15 pips @entity3 to take @entity34 @entity33 you 'd put your money on the @entity37 having a better race than his 25 - year - old colleague at this weekend 's @entity25 @entity33			1
and that 's before you look at @entity18 's record in his home event , which consists of two podiums , but no win			2
rewind to 2009 , and this race is where @entity15 won his very first grand prix at the age of 32 -- though that year it was held at @entity49 ; this weekend it will be at @entity50 , as the venues alternate			2
@entity20 's designer @entity52 admitted that @entity15 was absolutely gutted to miss the championship in 2010 , so much so that he brought some of that negative feeling into the next season			1
however , the reason for his troubles last year were even more basic than that			0
the winning formula for success ? 2011 was the year of the exhaust - blown diffuser -- a system whereby the designers managed to get the exhausts to " blow " over the rear diffuser even when the driver did n't have their foot on the throttle			2
this created a significant amount of downforce and extra grip , meaning the cars cornered like they were on rails and the drivers got less feedback through the steering wheel			0
@entity15 was n't a fan , unlike @entity18 -- who changed his style to suit the new characteristics			2
not only did @entity15 struggle to get the best out of the super-grippy car , but he also found the @entity86 tires difficult			0
if you 're up against one of the best drivers in the world as your teammate , you do n't need problems like that			2
sure enough he was regularly over half a second off @entity18 's pace , and that -- in @entity19 terms -- is an age			0
@entity15 signs one - year @entity20 extension this year the exhaust - blown diffusers have been banished from the sport , as have @entity15 's troubles			1
yes , the @entity86 tires continue to confound the drivers because of their complexity , but what the 35 - year - old does have is that " feel " back from the steering wheel			1
it may sound like a weak excuse , but in order to gain that last percent of performance in @entity19 , drivers need to balance the car on a knife - edge			0
if you are n't aggressive enough you 'll tumble down the time sheets ; if you fall the other side of the blade , you 'll rumble into the barriers			0
part of that balance is being able to feel every minute detail of what the car is			0
unlike 2011 , this year is not all about the speed of the @entity20 , though			0
the @entity25 @entity33 will not just be a two - horse race between @entity15 and @entity18			1
@entity15 wins @entity126 @entity4 has managed to transform its car into a competitive machine after a slow start to the season , and @entity131 should improve following a " crisis meeting " after the @entity34 @entity33			1
@entity133 and @entity134 finished down in eighth and 10th at @entity135 , soundly beaten by both the @entity136 , which is not where they expected to be			0
there 's a limit to what a team can do in two short weeks in order to turn their fortunes around , but @entity131 is the best in the business when it comes to in - season development			0
when the lights go out at the start of the race on sunday , @entity15 will -- qualifying problems aside -- be feeling confident			0
