-- despite the progress made toward gender equality , there remains this fact : women still hold fewer leadership positions in government and industry , and men still face a social stigma if they stay home , as @entity13 coo @entity12 writes in her much - discussed book , " @entity15 : women , work and the @entity18 to lead			1
" @entity12 talks about the need for women to " lean in " to greater leadership roles at work and insist on equal partnerships at home			1
we wanted to know what " leaning in " looks like in practice			1
@entity0 invited families to share their successes and struggles at balancing work and family			1
can women -- or for that matter , anyone -- be high - fliers at home and work ? and if so , how does it work ? what it means to " lean in " while arrangements differed , there was a common refrain : you ca n't go it alone , there 's no right path and we need to stop judging each other 's choices			1
' it boils down to removing the stereotypes ' " in our household , there are no traditional roles , " wrote @entity53 , a human resources specialist and mother of three in @entity55 , @entity56			1
she and her husband both work full - time , and he also goes to school at night			1
@entity53 puts in longer hours most days so she can have every other monday off for appointments			1
they keep their children -- ages 7 , 5 and 20 months -- on a strict routine during the week			1
working women , know your value above all , she said , " husbands need to understand that they will have to clean , wash clothes , cook , dress the kids or whatever needs to be done			1
... it boils down to removing the stereotypes of the traditional family			1
" wo n't work ' if it means paying someone to raise our kids ' @entity83 works as a federal law - enforcement agent , a job she wanted from the time she was a little girl			1
while she 's investigating criminal activities , her husband is taking their daughter to ballet , helping their son with his homework , preparing dinner and doing the laundry			1
he stays home with their three children , ages 6 , 3 and 1			1
trained as a lawyer , he has never found a job that earned enough to support their family			1
as much as he wants to work , he does n't want to do it " if it means paying someone else to raise our kids , " @entity83 said			1
professionally , " i am a better agent because he stays home			1
i could n't do this job full time as a mother to three little ones , if he did n't handle everything else , " @entity83 said			2
confessions of a busy mom : 5 lessons @entity83 's own parents both worked and her mother was the primary breadwinner			2
they raised her to associate happiness with a great job , not motherhood			2
yet as proud as she feels about being a special agent , @entity83 would quit her job and retire at 35 if her husband found a job that paid as much as hers			2
" @entity124 , no matter how much opportunity is afforded me , i 'm a mom through and through , " she said			2
" i have a fantastic job , no doubt			2
but i truly feel i would be more personally satisfied by not missing a moment of my kids ' childhoods			2
" ' life is a team effort ' one of 10 children , @entity133 was raised in a traditional household			2
his father worked as a meat cutter and never washed a dish			2
every night he sat in his place at the end of the table and was always served first			2
@entity133 met his wife - to - be , @entity142 , in 1999			2
he had two young children at the time and a job at an architectural firm that required he work up to 60 hours a week			1
all the day care pickups , cooking and housework fell to @entity142 , who was also in graduate school working on her doctorate			2
opinion : why women trash each other things came to a head when @entity133 's son was diagnosed with a developmental delay and needed extra care			1
@entity142 was pregnant at the time , and it was too much for her to handle everything			2
he decided to quit his job and build his own practice			2
" now i was home , running my business from the basement			2
now i picked up the kids from school , tidied the house , did all the laundry and when she came home , she did the cooking			0
" looking back , it was a " slow change			0
" but he realizes now @entity142 " would n't be very happy without a career , and i would n't be very happy without that wife			0
in a way i 'm married to her career , too			0
" ' the boys know they can always count on me ' " parenting is hard , and it does take a village			0
sometimes a village and a neighboring village , " wrote @entity187 , a divorced mom of two boys in @entity189 , @entity190			0
she works as an administrator in an @entity195 office and maintains blogs about motherhood and social media marketing			0
though technically she is a single mom , @entity199 often feels the need to add the disclaimer that her ex-husband is very involved with their children , of whom they share custody			1
opinion : @entity12 left single mothers behind she said too many women have bought into the notion they need to " bring home the bacon , fry it up in a pan , and never let their man forget he 's their man , " to paraphrase the song used in the 1980s commercial for @entity218 , " the 8 - hour perfume			1
" " there are times i ruminate on why i 'm not the kind of mom that can stay home and make homemade hummus with organically grown crinkle cut cucumbers , then i stop thinking about that because there is laundry to be done , hugs to give , dinner to cook , homework to check and inevitably something to pull out of the dog 's mouth , " she wrote			0
" @entity235 hummus or not , the boys know they can always count on me and their dad , and their extended family , and that is my version of ' having it all			1
' " ' it is hardly ever perfect ' " i used to be ashamed of the number of before - and after - care providers i employed , " wrote @entity242 , a mother of three and a registration coordinator for a large physician group in @entity245			0

but that 's not an option			0
the family needs her steady paycheck and the health insurance that comes with it			1
the kids are in day care most of the week			0
at work , she said , " leaning in " to bigger opportunities -- as @entity13 's @entity12 advises women -- does n't feel realistic , either			1
" i just do n't have the mental ability to put in 10 hours of work a day and additional work on the weekends , which seems to be the unspoken requirement ... in order to receive promotions in a typical work environment , and then coming home and cook dinner , clean up , and give my children my 100 % attention			1
" the myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career she said she gets through each day by " choosing sanity " and not comparing herself to other families			1
" my house is a war zone and guests know to call before they come over			0
pursuing a higher career is on hold so the spare time i do get is spent with my kids			0

she plans to return to a more demanding job when her youngest leaves for college in a couple of years			0
" the biggest mistake women make -- those that choose to stay at home and those that work and have others help with their kids -- is they think too much ! stop second guessing and move on with the decision you have made			1
... i have dear friends that are literally running the world , and others that have been home for 20 plus years -- thank goodness you had the choices you had ! " opinion : working moms , do n't try to be perfect at home			0
