-- she has eyelashes but no eyebrows			2
she has all her fingers but is missing four nails			2
her skin is so taut now that she can no longer frown			2
but she can still smile			2
her face tells a story of suffering			2
her name , @entity10 , tells a story of a new journey			1
last week , 4 - year - old @entity10 arrived in the @entity13 for what her caretaker , @entity14 , hopes will be the start of the rest of her life			1
@entity10 , discovered with severe burns in @entity20 , will undergo reconstructive surgery in january			1
she will never look fully normal , but @entity14 hopes the surgery will make it easier for @entity10 to grow older and help others see what @entity14 has seen all along : an effervescent bundle of love			1
in 2009 , @entity14 was on a medical mission with @entity30 - based @entity29 in @entity20 's @entity31			1
the region 's natural beauty was once compared to @entity34 's , but by then it was a @entity36 - infested area rife with violence			2
one of the doctors found three little girls left in a trash bin			1
" who are they ? " the doctor asked			2
where were their parents ? where were they from ? all anyone could say is that there had been a @entity13 drone attack , though @entity13 officials say that drones have never struck targets in @entity31			1
it was not known how the girls came to be where they were but one thing was clear : they 'd suffered horrific injuries			2
the doctor , who was traveling with @entity29 , took them back to a clinic			2
they were in grave condition			0
two of the girls died , but the littlest one had a chance of making it if she were treated right away			0
she was only a year old , @entity14 guessed , but small for her age			0
she had fresh burns all over her face , her scalp and on her arms			1
@entity14 began searching for the little girl 's family			1
she needed their consent before doctors operated on her			0
but when no one stepped forward , doctors proceeded anyway to treat the burns			0
otherwise , they would have to amputate her arm			0
otherwise , she might not survive			0
" life , " she said , " was a gift for her			0
" @entity14 continued to look for relatives , even scattered posters of @entity10 everywhere and solicited the help of the @entity20 army and a government official			1
but still , no one claimed her			0
@entity10 was finally taken to @entity93 in @entity94 , where she spent the next three years in a charity ward			1
@entity14 was finally able to bring @entity10 back to @entity96 , where @entity14 lives			1
when the @entity98 flight landed , @entity10 turned to @entity14 , whom she calls @entity99			1
" are we in @entity13 ? " she asked			0
" yes , " @entity14 replied			0
@entity10 put her hands together and clapped			1
on the plane , @entity10 had learned to count from 1 to 27 in @entity103			1
it was a good start , @entity14 thought			0
@entity29 has helped thousands of children with congenital birth defects or those who have been disfigured in war , but @entity10 was special			1
@entity14 raised three sons , who are grown			0
her house once again filled with the mirth of a youngster			0
" she 's like my tail , " @entity14 said			2
" she follows me around all day			0
" she took @entity10 to @entity113 's			1
@entity10 gobbled up chicken nuggets			1
she learned that in @entity13 , chips were called @entity117 fries and tomato sauce was ketchup			0
@entity14 was ironing her clothes tuesday when @entity10 ran up to her			1
" @entity99 , do you love me ? " she asked			0
" how much ? " " this much , " @entity14 said , gesturing			0
@entity10 ran into the bathroom , stood in front of the mirror and started screaming			1
it was then that @entity14 realized @entity10 was overwhelmed			1
she had gone that day to meet her doctor , @entity126 , at the @entity127 in @entity128			2
he volunteered to do the reconstructive surgery			1
@entity10 arrived in a turquoise striped dress , black leggings and white lacy socks			1
she wore beads around her neck and a big pink ring that @entity137 volunteer @entity136 gave her			0
she called him " @entity139 , " the @entity141 word for grandfather			0
at the hospital , @entity10 touched @entity126 's coat buttons ; the nurse 's stethoscope			1
she referred to @entity126 as her doctor and understood as best a child could that he was trying to make her well			2
" it 's not easy and it 's not a single - day procedure , " @entity126 said about the surgery			1
he will start january 16 with her right hand			0
he will never be able to give her eyebrows or restore the missing nails on four of her fingers			0
sometimes , when @entity10 eats spicy food , her flesh feels raw and irritated			1
she will have to always be careful about that			0
he will never be able to fix the severe discoloration on her forehead			0
but he hopes to reconstruct her nose , fix her eyes			0
@entity10 took it all in stride at the hospital			1
but it was that sense of belonging and being loved that was alien for her , @entity14 realized			0
" she needs security , " @entity14 said			0
" yesterday was a very emotional day for her			0
" @entity14 had been working with children for 25 years			0
but @entity10 was teaching her new things			1
@entity14 hopes @entity10 will be adopted by a family in the @entity13			2
it would be unfair , she said , to send @entity10 back to @entity20			1
she has no one there			0
for now , @entity10 will adjust to life in @entity13 in @entity14 's home			1
@entity14 may never know where @entity10 came from or who claimed her as a daughter			2
but she knows she was able to give @entity10 new life -- and a name that could not have been more fitting .			2

a doctor found the little girl in a trash bin in @entity20 's @entity31
her face and arms were severely burned
