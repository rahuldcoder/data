-- he is arguably the most well - known @entity2 general since @entity3 , and perhaps the most effective since @entity4			1
now gen. @entity5 takes on what many believe will be his biggest challenge yet : reversing the momentum of the @entity9 in @entity10 and helping to stabilize the rickety regime of @entity10 leader @entity12			1
@entity5 faced far more daunting challenges in @entity14 when he assumed command there in early 2007			1
those challenges , and how they were overcome , are worth recalling as he assumes command in @entity10 , as they may provide some indicators of the way forward there			1
first , @entity14 was embroiled in a vicious civil war in which @entity28 and @entity30 civilians were showing up dead on the streets of @entity14 's cities at the rate of 90 a day , some tortured in the most unspeakable manner , their heads drilled open			2
@entity14 's @entity35 , which was nominally in charge of the country 's security , itself had taken been taken over by @entity28 death squads			2
this was further complicated by the industrial - strength sunni insurgency led by @entity43 's vicious @entity14 affiliate			2
it recruited fighters from around the @entity46 , who were largely responsible for an epic campaign of suicide attacks that killed thousands of @entity14			2
indeed , more suicide attacks were conducted in @entity14 between 2003 and 2007 than had taken place in every other country of the world combined since 1981			2
the war was so violent that almost five million @entity14 -- around a fifth of the population -- fled their homes for the safety of other countries or internal exile			2
relatively few of those refugees have since returned			0
despite the widespread perception that @entity10 is today going to hell in a handbasket , more than five million @entity10 refugees have returned home since the fall of the @entity9			2
last year some 2,400 @entity10 civilians died in the war -- too many , of course , but in @entity14 when @entity5 took command , 3,200 civilians were dying every month , making @entity14 around 15 times more violent than @entity10 is today , when adjusted for relative population size			1
and contrary to the old saw that @entity10 are virulently opposed to foreign forces on their soil , a @entity78 / @entity77 poll taken earlier this year -- almost a decade after the fall of the @entity9 -- found that 62 percent of @entity10 support international forces in their country			1
contrast that with @entity14 , where a @entity78 / @entity77 poll taken just two years after the @entity2 - led invasion found that only one in three @entity14 supported the foreign soldiers in their country			1
this is a critical point in @entity10 , as the center of gravity in a counterinsurgency is the protection of the population itself , a theory of counterinsurgency warfare that @entity5 enshrined in @entity2 military doctrine , when he oversaw the work on the unglamorously named @entity95 3 - 24 in 2006 at the @entity97 's training center at @entity98 , @entity99			1
when the final version of the @entity95 was published in december 2006 , it was downloaded 1.5 million times within a month of its posting			0
the @entity105 gave it a serious review , something of a first for a dense military tome that weighed in at some 400 pages			0
the doctrines in that counterinsurgency manual have driven the subsequent actions of the @entity2 military both in @entity14 and @entity10			1
the following points from the manual summarize its central message : " unsuccessful practices : overemphasize killing and capturing the enemy rather than securing and engaging the populace ; conduct large - scale operations as the norm and concentrate military forces in large bases for protection			0
" successful practices , according to the manual : focus on the population , its needs , and its security , and provide amnesty and rehabilitation for those willing to support the new government			0
in a section titled " paradoxes , " the manual made a number of recommendations that were hardly typical of prevailing @entity2 military doctrine : " sometimes doing nothing is the best reaction " and " the host nation doing something tolerably is normally better than @entity2 doing it well			2
" these commonsense prescriptions would , in time , help to change the course of the @entity147			0
@entity5 , an intensely competitive officer with a ph.d. in international relations from @entity150 , assembled a brilliant staff to reassess and redirect the @entity147			1
when he arrived in @entity152 , @entity5 brought with him a sense that there was a plan			2
and he also had the full support of president @entity157 , with whom he held a weekly private videoconference , which was unprecedented since the president was circumventing several levels in the chain of command to speak to his field commander			0
watching @entity5 's @entity164 , held every morning at " @entity165 " in @entity152 , was to see a master at work , cajoling and cheerleading his commanders across the country via video link as they reported on every variable of the @entity14 body politic from the grandest of political issues to the minutest of water projects			1
the new team and new approach got @entity2 soldiers out of their bases and into the neighborhoods			2
it was amplified by the arrival of what would eventually become the 30,000 soldiers of the " surge " authorized by @entity157 as @entity5 took command in @entity14			1
@entity5 outlined his " population - centric " strategy in a three - page letter he distributed to all of the soldiers under his command			2
" you ca n't commute to this fight			0
... living among the people is essential to securing them and defeating the insurgents			0
... [ p ] atrol on foot and engage the population			0
situational awareness can only be guaranteed by interacting with people face - to - face , not separated by ballistic glass			0
" there were also shifting dynamics on the ground in @entity14 that would make the additional combat brigades of the surge a force multiplier rather than simply more cannon fodder for @entity14 's insurgents			2
those changes included : the rise of the " awakening " movements -- former @entity30 insurgents who signed up for security jobs paid for by the @entity2 military			2
previous sectarian cleansing that forced millions of @entity14 to flee their homes , and which made it harder for the death squads to find their victims			1
in @entity152 , half the @entity30 population had fled the city by the end of 2006			0
around the same time , efforts to register all military - age @entity14 males using biometrics such as retina scans , which created a useful database of that population			1
@entity233 built around vulnerable neighborhoods that kept insurgents out			0
better bomb detection devices , such as drones equipped to spot subtle anomalies in roads indicating the presence of bombs ; the increasing deployment of hulking armored vehicles with v - shaped hulls known as @entity245 , which are largely immune from roadside bombs ; and an aggressive effort to map and target the networks of @entity14 's bomb makers			0
all these things led to a decline in the number of deaths caused by the leading killer of @entity2 soldiers -- the improvised explosive device			0
the number of ied attacks in @entity14 dropped from almost 5,000 in 2006 to around 3,000 two years later			0
the @entity260 briefing slides so beloved of the @entity2 military showed the violence in @entity14 peaking in almost every category in the first months of 2007 and steadily dropping after that			1
that decline was true across the board , including attacks by insurgents , civilian deaths , @entity2 soldiers killed , @entity14 security forces killed , car - bomb attacks , and ied explosions			1
the number of @entity14 civilians dying in sectarian violence began a sharp decline from its high of around 90 every day in december 2006 , to single digits two years later			0
can @entity5 and his team pull off something similar in @entity10 ? the strategy that @entity5 will pursue there will not differ in any substantial way from that pursued by outgoing gen. @entity285			1
after all , @entity5 is the principal theorist and practitioner of counterinsurgency in the @entity2 military and was one of the small group of @entity292 leaders who pushed for @entity285 to be installed as the commander in @entity10 a year ago			1
as @entity5 himself has sometimes said , @entity10 could be harder than @entity14			1
and indeed it may be , for while the country is certainly not in the grip of a full - blown civil war as @entity14 was in early 2007 , it is still reeling from the effects of more than three decades of war			0
also , the @entity9 in @entity10 are not a bunch of foreigners with foreign ideas as @entity43 was in @entity14			1
in the rural @entity304 of @entity10 , the @entity9 are the guys you grew up with and are much savvier about how to win , if not the support , at least the acquiescence of a sizable part of the population			1
the insurgents in @entity14 had nothing on the scale of @entity315 's tribal regions as a safe haven , as the @entity9 do now , nor did they have the world 's largest supply of opium and heroin to help finance their insurgency			0
in @entity14 , @entity5 helped stanch a terrible bloodbath and bring the country up to the level where it is a state perpetually on the edge of conflict between @entity328 and @entity329 or between @entity28 and @entity30 , but it has at least achieved some kind of tenuous peace			1
in @entity10 , @entity5 must convince all sorts of constituencies , from the @entity10 people , to the @entity315 military and political establishment , to the @entity337 , to the @entity2 public , that some plausible progress is being made ; that the @entity2 are not going to " cut and run " before a semi-stable @entity10 government and military are in place			1
and he must do that all on a timetable in which some kind of @entity2 drawdown begins in july 2011			0
it 's as big a challenge as plugging the @entity349 oil spill , and to do it right might take as long as reversing the environmental catastrophe that is already in progress in the @entity352 -- a very long time , measured more in decades than in years			0
no one is better equipped to handle the challenge than gen. @entity5			1
but as a student of history , the general is surely aware that what worked on the banks of the @entity360 and @entity361 in 2007 could still crash on the shoals of reality on the banks of the @entity366 and @entity367 rivers several years later			0
as the philosopher pointed out : you ca n't step twice into the same river			0
not even someone as talented as @entity5			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity374 .			0

gen. @entity5 , who has a ph.d. from @entity150 , wrote the book on counterinsurgency
@entity374 says @entity5 accomplished a huge *turnaround* in @entity14
the general took many steps to gain public support for @entity2 efforts in @entity14 , @entity374 says
he notes @entity5 has said @entity10 will be harder
