-- does money make you happy ? does being rich contribute to your spiritual life and its possibilities ? is the gap between the rich and poor a religious problem as well as a social problem in desperate need of solutions ? @entity10 , @entity11 , and brain scientists have asked these questions , and the answers are clear if unnerving			1
wealth and power are dangerous for your mental health , your spiritual condition , and for society in general -- especially when they contribute to the neglect of the poor			1
new research explains how this works ( more on this in a minute )			2
@entity27 the world of poverty is , of course , a fantasy			2
@entity10 knew this : " you will always have the poor among you , " he said ( @entity33 )			1
he also said , " @entity34 blesses you who are poor , for the kingdom of @entity34 is yours			2
" ( @entity38 6:20 )			0
only a few verses before this moment in @entity38 , he cries ( echoing the @entity41 ) : " the spirit of the @entity43 is upon me , for he has anointed me to bring the good news to the poor			0
" ( @entity38 4:18 )			0
@entity10 also noted , famously and controversially , that it is easier " for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven			1
" ( @entity33 19:23 - 24 )			0
let 's just hope that we 've got some very skinny camels			0
@entity10 discouraged the accumulation of wealth , worried about its effects on those who had it , and took special pleasure in helping the poor , dedicating his efforts to them			1
he must have shaken his head at the large gaps between rich and poor throughout ancient @entity66 in the first century			0
pope @entity11 has taken up @entity10 ' call on this			1
on his recent visit to @entity70 , he repeated a cry that has become a central theme of his papacy , telling hundreds of thousands of listeners in @entity75 that the gap between the rich and poor in @entity70 was a problem , and they should think back to early @entity80 martyrs in @entity70			1
he said : " their example has much to say to us who live in societies where , alongside immense wealth , dire poverty is silently growing ; where the cry of the poor is seldom heeded and where @entity90 continues to call out to us , asking us to love and serve him by tending to our brothers and sisters in need			1
" everyone knows that the wealth gap in the @entity97 has increased dramatically			1
" the top 10 percent took more than half of the country 's overall income in 2012 , the highest proportion recorded in a century of government record keeping , " the @entity98 reported in april			0
it 's a problem that makes you dizzy , and one that will never be easily solved			0
indeed , the concentration of wealth at the very top of @entity97 society recalls the early 20th century , before the income - leveling measures of the @entity112 kicked in			2
the growing income gap is perhaps the most pressing issue before the world , not just the @entity97 , as the level of misery rises among the poor			0
even those formerly known as the middle class , who have struggled mightily to make ends meet for decades now , face an array of problems that create mental and physical pain on a vast scale			1
so let 's go back to @entity10 and @entity11 and their concerns			1
do people on the other end of this inequality equation really fare better ? does wealth make you happy ? @entity10 certainly did n't think so , as the baptist thinker @entity135 has recently noted			1
he writes : " the @entity97 marriage between market capitalism and @entity97 evangelical piety makes @entity10 impossible			1
his words are inconvenient at best and heretical at worst			0
@entity135 has spoken frankly and bravely here			0
he points to a fascinating new study from the @entity142			2
three @entity144 neuroscientists have suggested that being rich and powerful actually makes you less happy and , even worse , unable to sympathize with the poor			2
they find that the rich and powerful among us show less brain activity in that region of the brain where human sympathy is excited			2
" @entity157 diminishes all varieties of sympathy , " explains @entity153 , a social psychologist at the @entity154 , in a recent interview on @entity156			0
conversely , those who feel poor and marginalized in society show a great deal of sympathetic activity			0
the ability to sympathize with those around us seems crucial to our survival , and it 's connected to the mirroring functions of the brain			2
as the research now suggests , the richer and more powerful we feel , the deader will be that area of our brain where this crucial activity , which generates empathy , occurs			1
in fact , power fundamentally changes the way we respond to those around us			2
is it any wonder that when a rich young man came to @entity10 asking for spiritual guidance , @entity10 said : " if you wish to feel complete , go and sell your possessions and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven			1
" ( matthew 19:21 )			0
the young man " went away grieving , " as he had so much property and did n't want to let go of anything			0
but letting go is essential to our own happiness as well as the world 's economic equilibrium			0
@entity10 , @entity11 and brain scientists would agree on this			1
it 's a hard teaching , but it 's important .			0

@entity203 : @entity10 , @entity11 , scientists address question : does money make you happy ?
new study says wealth , power *bad* for your mental health -- as @entity10 knew
he says the @entity215 , in his @entity70 trip , said we must *redress* inequality
@entity203 : study finds too much wealth *suppresses* part of brain that causes empathy
