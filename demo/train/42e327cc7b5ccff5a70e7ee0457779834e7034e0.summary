@entity0 -- a small religious group has lost its fight before the @entity4 to erect a granite monument in a @entity7 park next to an existing @entity9 display			1
@entity10 , a religious group , wanted to place its own monument next to this @entity9 monument			1
in the free - speech case involving competing faiths , politics and social norms , the justices voted unanimously on wednesday that such privately donated displays on public property represent " government speech " subject to local officials ' discretion			1
@entity10 , a @entity25 - based group , wanted to put up a 3 - foot granite slab on the " @entity10 of @entity10 " in the city of @entity28 , at the group 's expense			1
local officials argued they should be allowed to decide which permanent displays can be erected , since they would claim ultimate ownership and control			2
the justices agreed with the city 's view			1
" it is hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression , " wrote justice @entity39			1
at issue was whether donated monuments on public property represent private or government speech			1
the ruling could affect monuments nationwide , ranging from 9/11 victim tributes to battlefield markers			0
" it is clear that the monuments in @entity28 's @entity58 represent government speech , " wrote @entity39			1
@entity10 argued that by denying it the necessary permit to erect the monument , it was being discriminated against because the existing @entity9 monument was placed there in 1971 by another private group , the @entity66			1
the case dealt only with free speech constraints , not the @entity69 , which prohibits government endorsement of religious faith or doctrine			1
both are contained in the @entity75 's @entity74			0
justice @entity76 confidently stated that the current @entity9 display in @entity28 does " not violate any part of the @entity74 ... the city can safely exhale			1
" not so fast , said @entity79 , @entity10 's lawyer			2
he notes the case now goes back to lower federal courts , where his group will make a new argument : the city violates the separation of church and state doctrine			2
" we 're going to say the city has adopted clearly religious tenets of @entity89 as their speech , " @entity79 told @entity1 , " and given this mounment has a prominent display in their public park , it 's clearly in violation of the @entity69			1
" he heads the @entity96			0
two justices seemed to anticipate the upcoming legal fight			0
" even if the @entity102 neither restricts nor protects government speech , government speakers are bound by the @entity75 's other proscriptions , including those supplied by the @entity69 and @entity107 , " wrote justices @entity99 and @entity101			1
" these constitutional safeguards ensure that the effect of today 's decision will be limited			0
" a conservative legal group that represented the @entity7 city hailed the high court ruling			2
" the decision gives government the right to speak for itself and the ability to communicate on behalf of its citizens , " said @entity114 , chief counsel for the @entity115			0
" it 's a landmark decision that clears the way for government to express its views and its history through the selection of monuments -- including religious monuments and displays			1
" the ruling joins a series of decisions in which the @entity4 has refused to offer a broad rule on religious monuments , taking a more case - specific approach			0
@entity9 displayed in public schools were banned in 1980			2
but the justices in 2005 allowed a 57 - year - old @entity9 granite monument to stay on the @entity141 statehouse grounds , where it stands amid a series of nonreligious symbols			1
a similar display in @entity146 was ordered removed after the high court concluded it violated the separation between church and state			0
unlike @entity7 , those cases involved efforts to remove the monuments			0
@entity10 was founded in 1975 by @entity155 , who claimed alien visitors -- or " advanced living beings " -- revealed the @entity10 concepts to him			2
he gathered several dozen members and launched a legal fight to erect monuments			0
he died earlier this year			0
classified as a tax - exempt church , @entity10 's members prefer to call it a philosophical group			1
they claim no over-arching doctrine or supreme being , but their movement is extensively laid out in pamphlets , a web site and internet radio broadcasts			0
on its one - acre compound in @entity25 -- along with a 27 - foot - tall copper - shelled pyramid -- is a building where the group uses resins and fiberglass in a lengthy rite of mummification , which the group 's current leader , @entity180 , called a key aspect of @entity10 , central to the idea that " the soul moves forward			1
" both humans and pets undergo the procedure			0
the @entity10 are psychokinesis , correspondence , vibration , opposition , rhythm , cause and effect and gender			2
" all we want to do is share what we have with everyone else			0
i mean , it 's not like proselytizing , " said @entity180 , 53 , who is a piano teacher			0
" not everyone follows the @entity9 , so maybe people are looking for something else , and all we want to do is show them the possibility			2
" @entity28 , with a population of 30,000 , lies between @entity25 and @entity206			0
@entity58 includes an old schoolhouse and wagons , along with the @entity9 monument , tucked back near a 9/11 memorial placed by a local @entity212 troop			1
" this park is dedicated to the history of the people , the founding of the city and significant citizens who have lived and contributed to the community , " said mayor @entity213			2
he said the @entity9 display was allowed because the @entity66 , which has erected similar monuments in hundreds of other communities since the 1950s , has long - standing ties to the community and performs continuing charity work			2
a federal appeals court had ruled for @entity10 , concluding parks are a " public forum " to which private groups have access under free - speech protections			1
@entity39 in his ruling cited several pop - culture references to illustrate how monuments convey often - competing meanings			0
one included the ad slogan " beef			0
it 's what 's for @entity243			0
" another included the lyrics to @entity247 's 1971 song " imagine , " which he said was made part of a mosaic honoring the late performer in @entity252 's @entity251 .			0
