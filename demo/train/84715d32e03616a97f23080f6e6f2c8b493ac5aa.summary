@entity0 -- we have all heard about the @entity3 , the rapid change which swept through the streets of the @entity5 and @entity6			1
in @entity8 in march , there was a brief coincidental @entity9 spring			0
10 out of 15 nations approved a @entity9 resolution endorsing a firm response to a crackdown in @entity14			1
i saw and felt a difference			0
@entity0 diplomats and staff expressed confidence and hope that the international organization was finally going to make a difference by being unified and taking dramatic action to help citizens threatened by their own government			2
' horror story upon horror story in @entity29 ' reporters were almost gleeful , dreaming that the slumbering global gang in @entity8 would now be ready to move on and take action in other trouble spots			1
alas , reality eventually set in			0
people call it the @entity14 hangover effect now			0
despite months of a similar violent crackdown in @entity29 , there has not been a peep from the @entity9			0
@entity40 and @entity41 are getting their diplomatic revenge for the way the @entity14 resolution quickly turned into @entity16 bombing			1
they feel the resolution was over-interpreted			2
the two countries have veto power when it comes to @entity0 voting at the @entity9 so a @entity29 resolution pushed by the @entity53 and @entity54 has stalled			1
@entity56 's foreign minister @entity55 said concerns with the @entity14 resolution was " influencing the way delegations look " at other resolutions , like @entity29			1
it 's the way it is at the @entity9 table			0
whether its @entity65 or @entity66 , no matter the level of repression , several countries led by @entity40 and @entity41 feel it is not the @entity0 's role to get involved in each member country 's dilemma			1
" the failure of the @entity9 to act is a tragedy , " says @entity73 of the @entity74			0
he says @entity41 and @entity40 fear that if the @entity9 feels empowered to address major human rights violations occurring around the world , eventually it could get around to @entity79 and @entity80			1
analysts feel @entity40 and @entity41 can hold out			1
other diplomatic initiatives , usually on the @entity5 , die on the vine at the @entity0 as events change and distractions occur			1
so far resolution backers say they have the nine votes minimum required for a yes vote , but ca n't avoid the veto threat			0
@entity40 and @entity41 have @entity90 to throw in their defense too			2
@entity93 countries @entity56 and @entity94 join @entity40 and @entity41 in opposition			1
they fear a resolution would help to destabilize a key @entity5 country			1
resolution proponents hope to get at least 11 out of 15 countries to sign onto the resolution , then test the veto threat			0
but watching diplomats leave a discussion on the resolution last week said it all			0
the @entity107 were glum , avoiding reporters ' eyes , while the @entity40 @entity0 ambassador was confident , smiling and remarking " no news is good news			2
" of course , even those who want a resolution have to concede they are fighting for a text which will not dent president @entity116 's regime			0
there is no threat of @entity14 - style military force or even sanctions			2
some countries have imposed their own unilateral sanctions against @entity29			1
a @entity0 resolution though is the toughest international diplomatic law			2
" we do think the @entity9 has to act			0
. it 's simply sending a message , " said @entity54 @entity0 ambassador @entity126			0
the resolution would demand an immediate end to the violence in @entity29 and condemn systematic human rights abuses			2
the proposed text calls on @entity29 authorities to lift the siege of affected towns and provide reforms for political participation , inclusive dialogue and the exercising of political freedoms			0
" the @entity9 has failed to react to @entity29 which is both extraordinary and disappointing , " said @entity140 , a former @entity53 diplomat at the @entity0 he now recommends citizens go around the @entity0 deadlock by using websites to highlight @entity29 or other government repression , and encourage more boycotts of products from companies involved with " problem " nations .			1

the @entity0 authorized action in @entity14 *swiftly* but @entity29 has been a different story
@entity40 and @entity41 are getting their diplomatic revenge ; they feel the @entity14 resolution was over-interpreted
other nations fear a @entity29 resolution would help to destabilize a key @entity5 country
some countries are imposing their own unilateral sanctions against @entity29
