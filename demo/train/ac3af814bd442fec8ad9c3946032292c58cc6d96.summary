-- everyone talks about our broken political system			1
politicians do n't know how to lead			1
citizens are not as attentive to governance and public policy as they should be			0
@entity11 either ignore politics or see it is one more form of entertainment , " @entity16 " on steroids			1
as a result , politicians get away with all kinds of misstatements and truths , in part because the electorate is so gullible			0
how do we make our democracy work better ? political reform will be essential to making sure that our institutions operate effectively			2
the news media needs to do a better job of separating truth from fiction and backing away from the increasingly partisan outlook of journalism			0
civic organizations need to do more to make sure that voters are active in politics and , at a minimum , that they actually vote on @entity39			0
but education is also going to be a key part of the equation			2
the way in which we teach our citizens in schools and colleges is how we shape our electorate from a very young age			0
if we do not do a good job imparting the basics that are needed to be virtuous members of our democracy , the system will never be repaired			2
unfortunately , there is some bad news on this front			0
a recent study by the @entity59 sounded the alarm that vital subjects such as history , literature , language , civics and the arts are in trouble			1
according to the report , the percentage of students majoring in the humanities has dropped in half , falling from 14 in 1966 to 7 in 2012			1
in 2010 , only 45 % of high school students were able to demonstrate a basic understanding of @entity11 history			1
government funding for this kind of research , compared with the sciences , has also fallen			0
the study points out that the federal share of funding for research in law and humanities was the only area of research that was smaller in 2011 than in 2005			1
in recent years , the @entity87 - controlled @entity86 has repeatedly targeted funding for political science research			2
the commission argues this kind of decision has hurt our nation 's economy			2
of the nation 's business leaders interviewed in the report , 51 % said they believed that a liberal arts education was " very important			1
" the humanities and social sciences are essential to making good citizens			2
to improve our politics , we need to make sure that these disciplines remain integral to the curriculum of our students			0
why ? each offers a particular set of tools that is hugely important to the ability of citizens to make good decisions			0
in history , my area of focus , understanding the past gives us a much richer understanding of the political problems facing the nation today			1
" history does n't repeat itself , but sure does rhyme , " @entity122 once said			1
we learn how politicians have tried to tackle problems before , what has worked and what has failed			1
there have been so many missteps in foreign policy , such as @entity132 , that could have been averted with a better understanding of the past			0
we also gain a better understanding of the roots and origins of contemporary challenges			0
if we approach issues such as immigration with that kind of long - term vision , we are in much better shape to actually tackle the forces that cause our problems and to do so in a way that does n't repeat the mistakes of the past			1
the study of language is absolutely essential in our modern world			0
in the 21st century , the lines separating one nation from the other continue to thin			0
the more that our leaders and citizens can communicate across broad swaths of territory , the better understanding we will have of how our government 's decisions affect different parts of the world and how events going on overseas might reshape the @entity11 back at home			1
the study of @entity168 , particularly literature , is a window into understanding different perspectives			0
there are few subjects like @entity168 that help students really probe how other people see the world , a rigorous exercise into looking into the mind of a writer as he or she unpacks characters , place and time			2
" it 's always amazing how little @entity186 and @entity87 know about each other , " writes @entity184			2
in an era when polarization has done so much to make this kind of communication among @entity11 virtually impossible in politics , the practice of literature is the best way to force oneself to shift perspectives and develop empathy for the worldview of others			1
it also is great instruction in the art of writing and communication , another skill that seems to be falling by the wayside in modern politics			0
finally , the study of civics is essential			2
political science can move students beyond the horse race that is often overcovered in journalism and into understanding the larger structural patterns and institutional dilemmas that continually shape politics			2
rather than just speaking about a red and blue @entity11 , we can see if the polling data actually supports that argument and , if it does , what the forces are that drive divisions between the parties			1
the kind of work that @entity227 has produced in the @entity228 , which offered much better understanding of what was happening in the election , is based on long - term statistical analysis rather than snapshot analysis			0
it 's built on the kind of rigorous civics instruction that schools can provide			1
in one of my classes on leadership in historical perspective , a former government official from overseas spent much of the semester writing a paper about how @entity245 approached the negotiations with @entity247 , hoping that one day he could use the lessons himself			0
he was recently appointed to a high - level position by his country 's president and might well be in an ideal position to translate this kind of learning into action			0
another student , an undergraduate economics major , decided to take one of my seminars on political history primarily for his intellectual curiosity			1
he told me that the readings on issues such as the @entity264 and the history of health care were enormously helpful in his recent work advising a high - level aide to president @entity269			0
one student who had a long career as state police trooper and who worked as an adviser to a governor pursued his doctorate in history			0
he had returned to complete his undergraduate degree after years in the workforce and found that studying the history of @entity11 politics opened up many insights into the origins of the problems he had confronted			1
others have applied their education in fields as diverse as child advocacy and international law			1
too often in our race to pour resources into disciplines such as the hard sciences that have more tangible applications and output , we lose sight of the kind of learning that is essential to produce good citizens			0
the costs of such bias become clearer every year , as our political system suffers and , as a nation , our government seems incapable of dealing with the biggest problems before us			1
policymakers would do well to rethink our narrowing vision of education			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity313 .			1

@entity313 : people *deplore* our broken political system , but do n't seek root causes
he says @entity11 education is turning away from fields such as history , civics , languages
@entity313 says a new report points out humanities majors have *declined* sharply
he says those who *'ve* studied history learn much that they can apply to today 's problems
