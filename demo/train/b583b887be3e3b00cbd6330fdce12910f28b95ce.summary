-- when the likes of @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity5 come storming across film screens this winter , in the drama @entity8 , viewers will be immersed in the world of @entity11 art theft			0
the @entity12 were a group of some three - hundred @entity14 officers charged with locating , protecting , and recovering art and monuments that were endangered by the fighting in @entity18 they would eventually learn of @entity21 's elaborate and highly - organized plan to strip @entity22 of its art. indeed , @entity21 had established a military unit solely dedicated to art and archive theft and made detailed plans to restructure the entirety of his boyhood town of @entity31 , @entity32 , into a city - wide " super museum , " containing every important artwork in the world			1
we have the so - called @entity12 to thank for the salvation of tens of thousands of masterpieces , among the estimated five million cultural objects stolen during the war			0
but while the film will focus on two great trophies , @entity46 's @entity45 , and @entity48 's @entity47 , there will be something of an elephant in the screening room			0
for a fascinating question remains , and one with a complicated answer : did the @entity53 steal the @entity55 ? the answer is that they thought they did			1
@entity55 's vanishing act the most famous act of theft associated with the @entity55 took place about a century ago			1
december 14 , 2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the return of the world 's most famous painting to public display , after it was stolen in 1911 from the world 's most famous museum			1
@entity69 's @entity55 was swiped from the under - secured @entity70 by an amateur @entity72 painter and handyman named @entity74			1
@entity74 was under the mistaken impression that the painting had been looted by @entity77 , during his @entity72 campaign			1
this was a pretty good guess , for through his art theft unit ( the first military unit in history dedicated to art theft ) , @entity77 had made off with tens of thousands of artworks during his @entity72 campaign			1
@entity69 's painting was not among them , however , as it had left @entity72 with the elderly @entity69 , when he spent his twilight years under the protection of the @entity91 king , @entity90 , who legally purchased several of his paintings after his death , the @entity55 among them			1
read more : @entity95 : evolution of the @entity98 art market but @entity74 had missed the lecture on this historical detail			0
he saw an opportunity to repatriate the painting when the firm for which he worked as a carpenter and glazier was hired to build protective cases to cover some of the @entity70 's most famous works , ostensibly to protect them from attack , after an anarchist had slashed an @entity113 painting in protest			1
@entity74 found himself with a @entity70 worker 's uniform , and direct contact with the @entity55			1
on the night before august 2 1911 , he hid inside a closet in the @entity70 , waiting for the footfalls of the night guards to fade into the distance			1
in the early morning hours , he slipped out of the closet , removed the @entity55 from its wall in the @entity70 of the @entity70 , and retreated to a service staircase			1
there he took the painting out of its frame , wrapped it in a white sheet , and headed down the stairs			0
there was surely a moment of great panic , when @entity74 twisted the doorknob at the foot of the stairs , and found it locked from the inside			0
he was prepared for an eventuality such as this , and had tools with him			0
he unscrewed the doorknob and slipped it into his pocket , thinking this might unlock the door , but it did n't			0
he was trapped inside the @entity70 , with the world 's most famous painting tucked under his arm ... and then he heard the sound of footsteps approaching			1
up the stairs came a plumber , making his morning rounds			0
to the plumber , @entity74 looked like a @entity70 worker who had accidentally been locked in overnight — not an unheard - of occurrence			2
he opened the door and let @entity158 out , thinking nothing of the @entity55 - shaped package that @entity74 carried with him			2
it would be two years before the @entity55 was seen again			2
the investigation was a fiasco that resulted in the dismissal of the head of the @entity70 and the head of the @entity168 police			2
international media mocked the lack of security at the @entity70 -- in fact , this was the first theft to spark the interest of the world media , kicking off a love affair with the elite world of high - priced art , and its theft			2
read more : rare @entity181 book sells for $ 14.2 million priceless loot the most cinematic and resounding success for the @entity12 was the salvation of the 12,000 masterpieces destined for @entity21 's planned @entity31 museum , which were stored in an ancient salt mine at @entity188 , in @entity32 , which had been converted by the @entity53 into a secret stolen art warehouse			0
it was supervised by a ferocious @entity192 officer , @entity191 , who was determined to destroy all of the art if he could not defend it against the @entity195			0
this is where the most famous pieces were kept , including gems by @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , and a who 's - who of @entity204 artists			0
but there is some confusion as to whether the @entity55 was there , as well			1
there are two primary source documents that attest to the @entity55 's presence in the @entity188 salt mine			2
the report of a secret mission called @entity216 , in which four @entity32 double - agents were parachuted into the alps to delay the destruction of the @entity188 mine until the @entity221 could arrive , stated that the double agents " saved such priceless objects as the @entity70 's @entity55			1
" another document from 12 december 1945 notes that " the @entity55 from @entity168 [ is included in ] 80 wagons of art and cultural objects from across @entity22 " that were found in the mine			1
and yet there is no record beyond these two documents of the world 's most famous painting being part of the world 's most famous hoard of looted art. surely that would have been noteworthy , a rescued prize as famous as @entity45			0
shrouded in mystery the @entity70 remained reticent about whether it had lost the @entity55 at all			1
the only documents about the painting during @entity18 attest to its having been crated up on august 27 , 1939 , and sent with other @entity91 national treasures to a series of five chateaux , for safe - keeping — theoretically just ahead of the advance of the @entity53 south through @entity91 , though the invaders quickly overtook the entire country			2
the next document that refers to the painting is not until 16 june 1945 , when the painting was listed as having been returned safely to the @entity70			1
its whereabouts during the war are unrecorded			0
but are they unknown ? the latest word from the @entity70 is that an identical copy of the @entity55 , also from the 16th century and difficult for any non-specialist to distinguish from the original , was one of a few thousand works that were gathered at the @entity260 , for whom owners could not be found			1
this copy was marked @entity260 265			0
after five years had passed with no one able to prove ownership , it went to the @entity70			2
from 1950 onward , it hung on the wall outside the office of the director of the museum			0
based on the available evidence , and a little detective work , a plausible ( though unconfirmed ) conclusion may be reached as to what happened to the @entity55 during the war			2
a painting was crated up in 1939 and sent to various castles , just ahead of @entity11 hands — but it was this 16th century copy , not the original			0
knowing that the @entity55 would be such an obvious target for @entity11 art hunters , the @entity70 may have kept the original hidden in @entity168 , while the copy led the @entity53 on a wild goose chase			1
this would explain why the " @entity55 " did return from @entity188 , but why it may also be that the " @entity55 " never left @entity168			2
it was the copy that was stolen , hidden at @entity188 , and recovered			0
some who saw it assumed it was the original , while others , specifically the art - savvy @entity12 who catalogued the art saved from the salt mine , recognized that it was only a copy			0

confusion remains where @entity55 was kept during @entity18
