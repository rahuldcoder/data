@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 trotted off the football field after making a special - teams play and headed to the bench			2
automated external defibrillators are increasingly available in public places , including airports and malls			1
@entity11 manned his lacrosse goal , blocked a shot with his chest and prepared to make a play on the ball in his first high school game			2
within seconds , each teen collapsed			2
in both cases , coaches , medical personnel and parents rushed to the boys , figuring they were dehydrated , had had the wind knocked out of them or had suffered a concussion			1
before they realized the boys were in cardiac arrest , both were dead			1
two 14 - year - old boys			2
two lives that could have been saved , their parents said , with one solution : an automated external defibrillator			1
if a defibrillator had been nearby , " there is no doubt in my mind @entity11 would be alive today , " said @entity11 ' dad , @entity35			2
eight years after their sons died , @entity11 and his wife , @entity42 , and @entity43 and @entity44 have made it their mission to make sure other parents do n't suffer the same wrenching loss			1
the couples successfully lobbied in their home states of @entity51 and @entity52 to pass laws mandating defibrillators in schools			1
now , these two families have joined cardiologist dr. @entity57 and lawmakers to push for a bill in the @entity61 @entity60 to mandate federal funding for defibrillators in primary and secondary schools across the nation			1
the automated external defibrillator is a portable , self - contained machine that can shock the heart back into rhythm			1
the device comes with complete audio instructions			2
in most cases , you 'll hear it tell you to remove the person 's clothes and place the electrode patches in specific locations			2
statistics show more than 200,000 @entity61 die of sudden cardiac arrest every year , according to the @entity81			1
up to 50,000 of these deaths could have been prevented , the association said , if someone had initiated what the group calls the @entity87 and a defibrillator had been available			0
in a study presented last fall at the annual heart association meeting , a team of heart experts from @entity91 reported evidence that at least 522 lives can be saved annually in the @entity61 and @entity96 by the widespread placement of automated external defibrillators			1
@entity61 rep. @entity99 , an @entity51 @entity100 , introduced a measure in @entity102 named for young @entity3 that would establish a grant program to help schools nationwide afford defibrillators			1
" the availability of automatic external defibrillators can be the difference between life and death when an individual goes into sudden cardiac arrest , " she said			1
" schools are central gathering places in our communities , and placing @entity115 in our schools will not only potentially save the lives of students enrolled there , but they will be available for teachers and staff , parents and volunteers , and the many other members of the community who pass through our schools every single day			1
" @entity57 joined the cause after seeing videotape of @entity3 's tragic death			0
" it was the most sickening thing in the world , " @entity57 said			0
" in that normally boisterous stadium you could hear a pin drop -- except for his mother wailing			0
" @entity57 is making it his goal to try and re-educate people on the importance of the lifesaving devices			0
" when someone collapses from a cardiac arrest , their heart starts to quiver , and unless immediately shocked , they 'll die , " he said			1
calling 911 and waiting for paramedics is not enough , he said			0
@entity57 said the average response time is eight to 12 minutes			0
" if you do the math , for every minute that they are lying there , the chances [ of survival ] decrease , " he said			0
" that 's why only a precious few survive			0
" one of the big fears that many people have about defibrillators , @entity57 said , is that they will hurt someone by using the machine			1
but in fact , the defibrillator wo n't automatically shock anyone			1
once placed on the patient , the defibrillator analyzes the heartbeat and wo n't deliver a shock if one is not medically needed			1
the device may prompt the rescuer to begin cpr			0
if a shock is needed , the machine instructs the person using it to stand clear			2
after the first jolt , it will continue to analyze the patient 's heartbeat to see whether more shocks are needed			0
for every minute a person is n't shocked , his or her chance of survival drops 10 percent , @entity57 said			0
with cpr alone , that survival rate improves , but use of a defibrillator can be as much as 10 times more effective , he said			0
studies have shown the devices can be used safely by anyone -- even children			0
@entity57 said in one study where paramedics and seventh - graders were trained on the machine , the students only took 29 seconds longer to figure out how to use them			0
one of the biggest concerns people have is that there is a liability if they try to use the defibrillator without training , but citizens are protected by the @entity205 , @entity57 said			0
the @entity11 and @entity3 families believe defibrillators at their children 's schools could have changed their lives			1
because the biggest problem in stocking schools with defibrillators is funding , the bill before the @entity60 would require the federal government to match funds for the devices			1
defibrillators cost about $ 1,500			2
" what 's a life worth ? " @entity222 asked			0
@entity35 said the answer is in the number of people whose lives have been saved because of the devices being in schools			2
" you 're asking the wrong person if this is a worthwhile device , " he said			0
" that morning i would have given everything to have owned one			0
