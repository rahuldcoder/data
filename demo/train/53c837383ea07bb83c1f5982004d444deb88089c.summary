one day last january , @entity0 , a 26 - year - old man with @entity1 , went to see the movie " @entity3			1
" when it was over , @entity0 briefly left the theater , then decided to return and see it again			1
the manager called security because @entity0 did n't pay , and three off - duty deputies , moonlighting at the mall , came in to confront him			1
according to @entity11 , @entity12 , police statements , he swore at them and refused to leave			1
the deputies tried to remove him , despite @entity0 's caretaker 's warnings and pleas for them to wait and let her take care of it			1
what happened next is a little unclear , but witnesses say the deputies put @entity0 on the floor , held him down and handcuffed him			1
@entity0 , called @entity24 by his family , suffered a fracture in his throat cartilage			1
the death was ruled a homicide , but a grand jury failed to indict the deputies and they returned to work without charges			2
my son has down syndrome , so i have been following this case closely			0
but for months , it seemed as if only people in the disability community cared about it			2
petitions for independent investigations sputtered out with just a few hundred votes			0
local reporting on the case never made a splash in national media			0
meanwhile , the @entity11 sheriff investigated his men 's conduct , ruled they had followed procedure correctly , and tried to move on			0
police violence against people with disabilities is not uncommon , but the cases do n't seem to get a lot of publicity			1
most people see the disabled as , at best , passive victims , objects to care for , perhaps to love , but not people with whom we automatically identify			1
we are all only temporarily able - bodied			0
accidents , illness , and age wait for us all			0
what happened to @entity0 could happen to you			1
in july , his death began to get more attention			0
@entity73 , a member of the @entity74 and candidate for governor , seized on @entity0 's story and called for new training for law enforcement			1
@entity80 , an investigative journalist in @entity81 , began to broadcast and write about the case			0
a petition asking gov. @entity84 to investigate went viral in mid-august , garnering 300,000 signatures in just a week			0
this petition fueled a renewed , suddenly national , media narrative			0
@entity0 and # @entity88 are now an official cause			1
what 's next ? an outside investigation either by the @entity92 or as part of a civil lawsuit might piece together the chain of events from the moment deputies confronted @entity0 to his death on the cinema floor			1
we need an unbiased assessment of responsibility , not just to help the @entity0 family understand -- although that 's important -- but to help all of us understand what went wrong			1
when law enforcement officers encounter people with disabilities , things can go wrong very easily			1
@entity110 trains police on how to respond to people with intellectual disabilities , and argues that such cases require special tactics			1
first , he says , law enforcement officers should ensure that they , bystanders and the person with a disability are all out of danger			2
if the situation is safe , @entity110 says , officers need to take all the time that 's necessary to resolve the problem without force			1
he tells officers that if the person with a disability is n't " aggressing into the officer 's space , " then there 's generally no good reason to " aggress into theirs			2
" @entity0 's aide was asking the officers to wait , rather than handcuff and arrest him , because he hated to be touched			1
to wait sounds a lot like common sense			0
according to both the officers ' and witnesses ' statements , no one seems to have been in danger , a deputy initiated contact only after @entity0 swore at them , and witnesses report that the officers remained calm throughout			1
at worst , taking more time would have inconvenienced other moviegoers -- who , in any event , did not see their movie because of the death			0
i ca n't say whether the deputies did anything wrong ; in fact , they may have followed their typical procedures to the letter			0
but with just a little more patience , @entity0 could still be alive			1
this tragedy raises questions about how people with disabilities fit into society			1
the @entity165 suggests that employers must offer reasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities			2
that standard has entered the broader culture , even as we repeatedly litigate the meaning of " reasonable			0
" would it have been reasonable to let @entity0 watch the movie for free ? would it have been reasonable to try to talk it out for 10 minutes , 30 minutes , an hour , delaying the start of a movie ? would it be reasonable to bar admission to people with disabilities ? making sure we figure out how to safely include people with disabilities throughout our community matters to everyone			1
here 's a very different story with an equally tragic ending			0
on august 2 , @entity187 , a 95 - year - old @entity188 veteran in @entity189 , @entity190 , was scared			0
he did n't want to go to the hospital for surgery , because he did n't want to end up on life support			0
the staff at his assisted living community decided to involuntarily commit him and called the police			2
he threatened the staff with a shoehorn and a cane			0
they shot him with a taser and and fired beanbag rounds at him			0
the @entity189 police say , " attempts were made verbally to have the resident comply with demands to drop the articles , to no avail			2
" the police claim he had a kitchen knife , but the family disputes this , saying there was no knife in the old man 's room before the incident			2
unlike @entity219 , @entity187 was not born with a disability			0
he made it through @entity188 with his body intact			0
but he was only temporarily able - bodied , then age caught up with him			0
once in the world of disability , confused and stripped of his power to govern his body , he encountered the police and was killed			2
disability rights are universal human rights , not abstract principles			2
but if it takes a personal reason to care about rights for the disabled , remember this : you might need them someday .			2

@entity0 , 26 , with @entity1 , died in a cinema when he refused to leave
witnesses say officers put him on floor and handcuffed him , and he died of asphyxiation
@entity248 : police need to learn to deal with people with disabilities without force
@entity248 : we all benefit from disabled rights , we will be old and disabled one day
