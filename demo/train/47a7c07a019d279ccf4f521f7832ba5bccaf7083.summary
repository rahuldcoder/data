@entity0 , @entity1 -- with only days to go before the @entity3 puts forward its recommendations on development goals beyond 2015 , after the current @entity6 expire , progress towards gender equality and increased empowerment of women hangs in the balance			1
it is vital that this issue does not slip down the global agenda but retains its rightful position as one of the key , stand - alone development goals			1
the current goals contain a specific commitment to women 's equality and empowerment , which has -- while not perfect -- succeeded in putting the subject firmly on the global map , giving impetus and strength to organizations working in this field , in their relations with governments , their ability to push against cultural barriers , and their capacity to raise funds for their work			1
that 's why we 've seen some progress in recent years			1
more girls are going to school , and the gender gap in formal education is closing in the majority of countries			1
in some areas such as @entity47 and the @entity48 , more women than men are enrolled in tertiary education , but women have yet to catch up in political representation , technology , access to capital and management skills , to name but a few examples			2
in the discussions that are taking place about what will replace the @entity6 post- 2015 , there are voices arguing for abandonment of this stand - alone commitment to women 's equality , in favor of a more generalized commitment to tackle ' inequality			1
' were these voices to carry the day , the negative effect on progress towards gender equality would be substantial , but crucially it would also undermine the cause of reducing ' inequality			1
' this is because improving the status of women is crucial to tackling the very inequalities that it is suggested the new goals should focus on			2
whether it 's making sure that children have access to education or health care , or bringing in more income for the family , so many of these core development goals are primarily delivered by women			1
women are on the road to becoming drivers of their economies , running businesses , and creating jobs and opportunities within their communities and beyond			2
according to the @entity99 , we need to create 600 million jobs globally by 2020 , mainly in developing countries , just to keep up with population growth			2
but we will inevitably fail to achieve employment targets unless many more women have economic opportunities			0
the more power they have , the more they can deliver			0
i have seen for myself how women 's financial independence delivers benefits to their families and to wider society			0
on a recent trip to @entity116 and @entity117 , i spoke with some women entrepreneurs and asked them what they spent their money on and they said their families			0
on educating their children and taking care of their health			0
on investing back into their businesses and hiring additional employees			0
not one had spent the income on @entity129 , communities and economies suffer when women are treated as unequal to men			0
furthermore , without female role models for future generations of women , progress will not just stall -- it will reverse			2
leveling the playing field -- where women and men have equal chances to become economically , socially and politically active , make decisions , and shape policies -- is likely to lead over time to more representative , and more inclusive , institutions and policy choices and thus to a better development path			2
in order for us to achieve real progress in development , gender equality must be a standalone goal			1
i am not alone in this view			0
there are many others who have been calling for the same for months			0
the @entity158 has called for women and girls to be front and center in the post- 2015 framework			1
the @entity164 has convened 85 of the @entity166 's leading development ngos and gender experts to ensure women 's empowerment is promoted in the next framework			1
their most recent report argues that the next framework must tackle the underlying causes of gender inequality to achieve sustainable change			1
@entity176 women have called for a goal that includes issues specifically about women , such as eliminating violence against women and girls , expanding women 's choices and opportunities , ensuring their full participation in decision - making at all levels , and including targets and indicators that specifically relate to women			1
as the @entity192 on @entity193 issue their recommendations , we must keep up the pressure			0
women are at the heart of every family			0
they are the mothers , the carers , the managers , the peacemakers			0
but they can deliver so much more			0
as we look ahead to a new framework , we can not afford to let gender equality slip off the world agenda			1
our future depends on it			0
give women equality of opportunity and the rest will follow .			2

with @entity6 to expire , @entity176 @entity3 will meet to discuss post- 2015 goals
@entity214 wants gender equality to remain on @entity176 global development goals
she argues progress has been made , but more must be done to combat inequality
