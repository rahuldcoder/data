-- the college students who showed up with bare midriffs and never contributed to discussions during @entity5 's communication classes were surprised when they were n't picked for coveted internships and jobs			1
they would also e-mail the public relations executive without so much as a greeting but with demands such as " i need a reference , " or " i need a letter of recommendation			0
" no " please , " no " thank you , " no face - to - face handshakes , introductions or follow - ups after classes			0
these same students would " friend " @entity5 on @entity20 -- it was a class about branding yourself , after all , so the social networking site genuinely came into play from an academic standpoint			1
but @entity5 would find her @entity20 newsfeed filled up with updates from these young adults posting salacious statements and tagging one another in drunken and / or raunchy photos			1
@entity5 was taken back by their behavior and wondered whether the students realized she was a potential future boss or colleague			1
that 's when it clicked for her : teach basic social skills to children because if they want to get far in life , manners are a requirement , not an option			1
she started socialsklz :-) to help kids learn what they were not being taught at school			1
@entity49 :-) logo includes a smiley face icon to convey its fun , interactive , hip relevance			2
@entity5 is quick to point out that these are not fancy manners and etiquette classes			1
" it 's not pinkies - up and pearls at high tea , " @entity5 told @entity0			1
she likens it more akin to " life skills 101			1
" during a class for children 4 to 7 , they were taught about the importance of eye contact and a firm , but not too tight , handshake			2
they were also led through basic greetings as well as proper phone etiquette when calling friends			0
the children practiced with each other in interactive scenarios			2
after being taught the principles of writing letters , they wrote thank you notes to their parents to highlight the importance of being thoughtful in life			2
in the coming weeks , they will learn online and text messaging etiquette as well as table manners and much more			2
@entity5 politely corrected kids on some basic errors , such as when one little girl kept saying " ax " when she really meant " ask			1
" the ' tween group of 8 - to 12 - year - olds was slowly but surely being taught to drop their penchant for saying " um , " incorrect usage of the word " like " and uttering the dreaded phrase " ya know			0
" the kids were issued cards called @entity99 when they broke @entity5 's " like , um , ya know " rule and cards were counted up at the end of class			1
one little boy racked up 11 " um " @entity99			0
the ' tweens also went on a field trip to @entity108			0
on the way , one of the boys held the elevator for everyone while another held doors open			0
each child ordered his or her own doughnut of choice and had to speak clearly and enunciate			0
@entity5 also encouraged them to have their selections ready so as not to hold up the line			1
the teen group , which meets for two hours a week , learns social graces as well as skills needed for college and job interviews			1
@entity127 , a career counselor at @entity128 , warns the first few minutes of a job interview can mean the difference between getting a job or not			2
" appropriate dress attire , a firm handshake , a relaxed smile and maintaining direct contact are all essential elements of a good interview before the actual process even begins , " says @entity127 who previously worked in @entity132 for a large institution			2
and do n't go to an interview without doing something else important she warns			0
" the advice i usually give students and my adult clients is to be sure to practice , practice , practice , " @entity127 says			0
" @entity149 is the only way to become better at interviewing , and it 's something all job candidates must take the time to do			0
" the socialsklz :-) teen students are also taught about e-mail etiquette and about the perils of posting something on a blog that they might regret later			1
they also learn the do 's and don'ts of posting material on sites such as @entity20 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
young job seekers have to transition from being a family member , friend or student to a professional in their online communications , warns @entity173 , assistant dean for career development in the @entity175 at @entity176 in @entity177			0
she says do n't be too casual and write things such as " @entity179 , " " hey , " " thx , " " np. " and do n't send a recruiter a friend request on @entity20			0
but within 24 hours after an interview with a potential employer , @entity173 says , the job applicant should write a thank you note			0
@entity5 said the real reward is when parents approach her and tell her that they see their kids using their newly acquired social skills out in the real world			1
she is also proud when she sees first - hand the confidence that her classes instill in her students .			0
