@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the @entity1 faced a long , grim path to recovery in the wake of @entity7 , the storm plowed into northeastern @entity8 early monday , packing powerful winds and forcing hundreds of thousands to evacuate			1
@entity1 authorities warned that the typhoon may have killed thousands there , leaving behind a trail of devastation on a scale they 'd never seen before			1
bodies scattered on the streets			0
and a death toll that could soar			0
the @entity1 @entity28 estimates that at least 1,200 people were killed by the storm , but that number could grow as officials make their way to remote areas made nearly inaccessible by @entity7			1
others put the toll much higher : the @entity37 said it 's realistic to estimate that 10,000 people may have died nationally			1
the grim task of counting the bodies was just beginning monday as authorities sifted through the rubble of what was left behind in hard - hit cities like @entity0 on the island of @entity47			1
the official toll stood at 255 monday , according to the country 's @entity49			0
" i have not spoken to anyone who has not lost someone , a relative close to them			0
we are looking for as many as we can , " @entity0 mayor @entity56 told @entity2			1
interactive map of the storm ' this is really , really like bad ' desperately needed aid was making its way into the storm - ravaged city of @entity0 on monday			1
c - 130 planes arrived , carrying food , water and supplies			0
other planes left -- some of them carrying body bags with storm victims			2
a steady stream of typhoon survivors arrived at @entity76 , looking for food , water and escape			2
she had lost her home and business			0
and she was desperate to leave on the next military plane			0
she made an anguished plea for help			0
" get international help to come here now -- not tomorrow , now , " she said			0
" this is really , really like bad , bad , worse than hell , worse than hell			0
" she directed some of her anger at @entity1 president @entity93 , who on sunday toured some of the areas hit hardest by the typhoon , including @entity0			1
many of the people in the city , population 200,000 , are angry at the authorities ' slow response to the disaster			1
@entity93 said there was a breakdown , especially at the local government level			1
" they are necessary first responders , and too many of them were also affected and did not report for work , " he explained , saying that contributed to the slow delivery			1
@entity93 said the government will coordinate with the local units and put more people to work			1
supplies become scarce in @entity0 , the search for food and water led to increasingly desperate efforts			1
@entity121 showed people breaking into grocery stores and cash machines in the city			2
national police and the military sent reinforcements to the city sunday to prevent such thefts			0
and authorities said they were sending several hundred additional security personnel into the city to keep law and order			0
another dire scene played out in the city 's only functioning hospital			0
doctors could n't admit any more wounded victims -- there was n't enough room			0
some of the injured lay in the hospital 's cramped hallways seeking treatment			0
" we have n't anything left to help people with , " one of the doctors said			2
" we have to get supplies in immediately			0
" complicating the search efforts is the lack of electricity in many parts of the storm 's path			2
the northern part of @entity159 , in the central @entity1 , suffered a blackout sunday , and authorities said it will take months to restore power			1
crews search for victims , survivors @entity56 , @entity0 's mayor , told @entity2 that reports 10,000 people may have died in @entity47 province were " entirely possible			1
" " people here were convinced that it looked like a tsunami , " he said			2
the @entity37 said it is fairly realistic to estimate that 10,000 people may have died nationally , because many areas are unreachable by organizations			1
" in the western islands of @entity1 , for instance , no one can evaluate the casualties , " said @entity37 spokesman @entity175			1
" it could effectively be a number close to 10,000 , " @entity175 told @entity2			2
" but the notion that 10,000 people are dead in @entity0 alone is not possible			1
" aid groups struggle to reach those suffering the @entity185 's @entity184 is setting up logistic pipelines to transport food and other relief items			0
" the main challenges right now are related to logistics , " said @entity184 representative @entity189 , who returned to @entity190 from the affected areas on sunday			0
" roads are blocked , airports are destroyed			0
" interactive map of the storm @entity184 spokeswoman @entity198 said the @entity185 group was gearing up its global resources to send enough food to feed 120,000 people			1
" these high - energy biscuits will keep them alive , " she said			0
@entity198 pleaded for financial support from the international community and directed those wishing to donate to @entity208			0
" those are families like you and me , and they just need our help right now , " she said			0
@entity1 gets more than its share of disasters @entity216 makes landfall in @entity8 the massive losses in the @entity1 have put much of @entity8 on edge			1
authorities evacuated around 600,000 people from vulnerable areas as the typhoon neared , the @entity8 government 's official online newspaper @entity220 reported			1
@entity7 made landfall around 4 a.m. monday ( 4 p.m. sunday et ) with sustained winds of 120 kph ( 75 mph ) and gusts of 150 kph ( 93 mph )			1
at least six people were initially reported to have died as a result of the storm , according to @entity220			1
the storm had weakened by the time it hit @entity8 , and it was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall			1
but it 's still expected to cause heavy rain and flooding in northern @entity8 and southern @entity238			2
tropical cyclones with sustained surface winds of 74 mph or more are known as typhoons when they form west of the international date line			2
east of the line , they 're known as hurricanes			0
an enormous blow @entity7 may be the strongest tropical cyclone in recorded history , but meteorologists said it will take further analysis to confirm whether it set a record			1
the typhoon was 3.5 times more forceful than @entity255 , which hit the @entity256 2005			0
it was n't the storm 's 250 - kph ( 155 - mph ) gusts that caused most of the damage -- it was a mammoth storm surge that reached up to 5 meters ( 16 feet ) high			2
