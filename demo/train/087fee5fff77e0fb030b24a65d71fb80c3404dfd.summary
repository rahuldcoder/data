-- returning home from the @entity3 , i discovered the level of @entity6 media coverage for a global sports event			1
ten days of competition , 21 sports , and 503 events crammed into five - and - a - half hours of coverage			1
to think that we have 227 athletes who just returned home after representing @entity14 at the largest @entity15 in history , where 2.7 million tickets were sold , and most @entity6 did n't even know about it			1
that hits home personally , not only because i am a @entity15 , but because four - and - a - half years ago i was like most @entity6 and did n't know about the @entity3			1
opinion : the @entity3 were brilliant , why were n't you watching ? before i was paralyzed , i did n't so much as know the word @entity3 even existed			1
i was raised in a well educated household in @entity24 , but i knew nothing about the @entity3 until after my paralysis in 2008			1
after i was paralyzed swimming saved me ; swimming gave me hope again and allowed me to believe in what my future could hold			1
from disaster to triumph : a week in the life of @entity34 swimming , and being involved in the @entity3 , changed my life and changed me as a person			1
silent voices i saw how getting involved in not only the @entity3 , but athletics changed my life			1
i have heard countless stories of amazing ability that my fellow @entity14 teammates displayed			2
but how many of them were and are heard ? how many paralympians are household names in the @entity6 ? how many households are aware of the @entity3 ? the biggest difference i noticed though was the appreciation for @entity15 athletes overseas			1
during the @entity3 , when i left the village and went into @entity51 , people knew about the @entity15 , not just knew about them but respected them and were following them			1
the media coverage was totally different there			2
you could n't turn on the television without seeing it , much like it is during the @entity58 here in the @entity6			1
for me it is my hope that i can continue to help push the @entity15 movement forward for generations of athletes to come , just as those before me paved the way for opportunities i have been fortunate enough to experience			1
so it is a weird feeling being back home			2
four years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over			2
i have spent time at home unpacking and organizing my things and it feels like yesterday i was packing my bags for the start of this adventure			2
i trained for four - and - a - half years and it is already over			1
i am back home and making plans as to what i do next , starting to plan my next four years as i begin training for the @entity80			2
overcoming adversity i will be honest , coming home from @entity51 is n't what i expected it to be			2
my goal was to come home as the @entity15 ' most successful athlete ; my goal was to bring home nine gold medals			1
as i got on the plane to return to @entity24 i carried one gold medal and one bronze , but i carried them with pride			1
what i had to go through to earn both of those medals makes them more meaningful than nine golds ever could be			2
that medal represents more than just a winning performance			2
that one gold medal represents hope , belief , overcoming adversity , a dream and my supporters who backed me throughout the entire journey			1
when i look at it i see everything i went through to get it , the ups and the downs , the joy and the pain			2
when i look at my gold medal , i see a dream that i made four - and - a - half years ago and the journey it took to achieve that dream			1
in life we all make plans			0
we have this idea of how things are supposed to go and when they do n't go according to plan we often find ourselves disappointed			0
i feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are			0
life does n't go according to a plan			0
we can map it out , we can plan it , we can even envision it but often we find that life has a plan of its own			0
my life this past month had a plan of its own			0
it did n't matter that i had planned that moment for the past four years , it did n't matter that i had done everything in my power to try and control the situation			0
when the day came to a close the plan i had envisioned was n't the plan that life had for me			0
bubble over these past few weeks , as i have tried to understand what happened and make sense of it all , i have realized everything happens for a reason			0
there is a reason i was reclassified in @entity51 , there is a reason life threw me another curve ball , and there is a reason i am sitting here in a wheelchair			0
as i came back home , i continued to reflect on @entity51 and felt many emotions			0
as an athlete i have put a lot of thought into what i can do different next time			0
what can i change in my preparations over these next four years before the @entity80 ? i have also found myself settling back into life			0
when i was in @entity51 we as athletes were in this little bubble , the village			0
we were away from the real world in many ways			0
we did n't think of what day of the week it was or what the date was , we thought of what day of competition it was			0
most of us were cut off from the real world because our lovely cell phones did n't work internationally			0
but then we return home and real life hits			0
you no longer are completely focused on competition ; you are no longer surrounded by other athletes in the bubble			0
