@entity0 -- his wife advised him not to go			0
his friends said it was too dangerous			0
but in 2011 veteran american football coach @entity6 ignored the warnings and traveled to the @entity8 of @entity9 -- @entity11 's longtime political nemesis -- to help @entity9 's national football team qualify for the @entity13 in @entity14			1
" sports is my life , " said @entity6			1
" when i came to @entity9 it did n't have anything to do with political reasons			1
my personality is one of adventure and curiosity			0
i wanted to experience a culture in a part of the world i had never been to			0
" the goalkeeping coach 's journey to @entity9 is the latest chapter in an international career that 's taken the 58 - year - old from the amateur football leagues in the @entity34 state of @entity35 -- where he was born -- to the football capitals of the world			1
the @entity39 - @entity34 's resume includes stints with @entity42 's @entity41 and the @entity39 national team -- featuring megastar @entity44 -- which qualified for the @entity45			1
in 2011 , @entity6 's friend and former colleague @entity46 was named head of coach of @entity9 's national football team			1
soon after , @entity46 invited @entity6 to join the coaching staff in @entity9			1
at the time , the @entity9 government was locked in a bitter political feud with @entity11			2
@entity9 regularly called the @entity34 " @entity54 "			1
@entity34 politicians frequently described @entity9 as a rogue nation led by a radical regime , secretly building a nuclear bomb			1
when discussing @entity11 's conflict with @entity0 , @entity34 president @entity59 said that " all options are on the table " , suggesting an attack against @entity9 was not out of the question			1
despite the ominous climate @entity6 accepted the offer -- a decision his wife was n't quite comfortable with			2
" she was shocked , " @entity6 said			2
" she was concerned as most family members were			0
" @entity6 admits he had concerns too			2
" when we first arrived , we did n't know how to behave and how to react , " he said			0
during his first few months @entity6 did n't socialize much and rarely left his apartment , except for trips to football practice			1
but @entity6 says he steadily started feeling comfortable			2
he says he learned his impressions of @entity9 , created mostly by the media , did n't quite match reality			2
" when you listen to the news and you read the news , you see things			0
sometimes during commercials i step off my couch and look out of the balcony and it 's not what i am seeing , it 's not what i am reading , it 's not what i am hearing			0
" @entity6 says what he has observed during his stay in @entity9 is a nation full of generous people who love their country , their food and their football team			1
one of his most memorable moments was meeting former @entity9 president @entity98			2
" he walked on to the pitch and asked everyone to sit down , and then he himself sat down on the grass , " @entity6 said			2
" i thought it was interesting how he put himself on the same level as everyone else			0
at the end of the day -- i saw him as another human being			0
" in recent months , @entity6 's stay in @entity9 has coincided with a push by @entity0 to improve relations with @entity11 , as moderate president @entity112 tries to settle @entity9 's nuclear dispute with the west			1
" right now more than ever there seems to be a lot of hope and optimism and a sense of energy that things will get better , " says @entity6			0
" for me i believe in peace , and , if peace is an end result , then that 's best for the world			0
" but the highlight of @entity6 's @entity9 adventure came on the night of june 18 , when @entity9 's national football team recorded a 1 - 0 win over @entity131 to qualify for the @entity13 for only the fourth time			1
the win sparked frenzied celebrations on the field and in the streets of @entity0			0
" there were a lot of tears , a lot of hugging			0
you ca n't describe it			0
only a few privileged people have the opportunity to climb the mountain and go to the big dance in @entity14 in 2014			0
" @entity6 says his only disappointment that night was not being able to share the win with his wife and family back in @entity34			1
his contract in @entity9 runs through @entity13 in @entity14 next june and july			1
he says his focus is to help @entity9 impress at the tournament and then return to @entity34 with some remarkable memories			1
" if i would 've listened to the experts , and my friends , and family , i would have never been here in @entity9			0
it 's been part of my life for three years and the memories will last a lifetime			0
