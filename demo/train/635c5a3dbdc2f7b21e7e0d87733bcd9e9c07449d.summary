@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 president @entity3 on thursday defended his decision to end fuel subsidies , a move that caused gasoline and diesel prices to spike and has led to protests in major cities since it was announced over the weekend			1
the country 's subsidies led to an artificially low price for diesel and gasoline , which resulted in widespread smuggling of those products to neighboring countries , where smugglers sold it for a profit , @entity13 told @entity2 en @entity25			1
" there 's a tremendous amount of smuggling ( to @entity29 and @entity30 ) and the state loses			2
" for example , @entity1 will spend $ 660 million this year importing fuel , of which $ 380 million will have been subsidized by the government , he said			1
of that , he said , $ 150 million will have been siphoned out of the country through contraband sales of the gasoline and diesel in neighboring countries , where the price is higher			1
" for a small country like @entity1 , that 's a lot of change , " he said			2
@entity13 ' remarks came a day after he attempted to explain the move in a nationally televised address			1
though the initial price shock may seem high , the average @entity4 will benefit from the move , he said			1
money saved under the new policy will be plowed back into the economy , with 20 percent increases in the minimum wage and spending in education , health , and security , he said			2
" our policies are always to favor the poor people , " said @entity13 , the nation 's first indigenous president			1
for those people who will not be helped by the salary increases , he said , " the only way ( to help them ) is to create new jobs			0
" he acknowledged that transportation costs in some areas have doubled since sunday , when his government announced he was ending the subsidies , but blamed unscrupulous @entity4 for the increases			1
" evidently , there are some people in transportation who take advantage of this situation and increase their fares by 100 percent , " said the president			2
government studies indicate that public transportation fares should have increased by no more than 30 percent , he said			0
in @entity84 , hundreds of people -- most of them young -- gathered outside government buildings , breaking windows and dismantling a protective fence in front of one			0
in the afternoon , demonstrators broke windows at the mayor 's office , pelted cars whose drivers dared drive in the area , and set parked cars afire			0
in @entity100 , hundreds of demonstrators broke into one government building and hauled files from the offices to the street , where they set them ablaze			0
in some areas , demonstrators blocked traffic for brief periods until they were dispersed by police			0
once the police had left , they would do it again , according to a reporter for @entity1			0
asked about protests in the streets of major cities like @entity0 , the capital , @entity13 questioned the use of the word " massive " to describe them			1
" the information i have is some 5,000 @entity4 " have demonstrated			1
he suggested that his opposition was mobilizing the protests for political gain			2
" this will stabilize , " he said			0
" i have a lot of faith			0
" @entity13 also said his government will seek to counter the impact of the price increases by investing $ 300,000 per rural municipality across @entity1 to spur economic growth through the creation of infrastructure projects with an emphasis on irrigation			1
gasoline prices rose by as much as 73 percent and diesel by 83 percent monday			0
subsidies had kept the price of gasoline at about 50 cents per liter ( $ 1.88 per gallon )			1
by comparison , neighboring @entity29 sells gasoline at $ 1 per liter and @entity30 at $ 1.58 per liter			2
the president of the @entity145 , @entity146 , disputed @entity13 ' assertion that the business sector had orchestrated the demonstrations			1
" he 's badly informed , " @entity150 told @entity151			0
" he is attacking the private sector , which is the sector that has shown responsibility			2
" for example , he said , the @entity154 , which is a member of his organization , calmed rumors wednesday of an imminent financial crisis that could have led to a run on the nation 's banks			0
@entity150 added that the vast majority of employees in the country will not be affected by @entity13 ' 20 percent wage increase , and he worried aloud that the move would result instead in higher inflation			1
" the invisible hand of the market has returned to the country , " he said			0
" @entity150 said he was not opposed to raising the price of petroleum products , but he criticized what he said was @entity13 ' failure to consult with other sectors prior to acting			1
" why not build among all of us a productive policy ? " he asked			0
" we want to build a country			0
" @entity2 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
