@entity0 -- the number making @entity3 anxious these days is 15			1
that 's the lead @entity5 have over @entity7 among working class voters in the final days of the 2014 midterm elections , according to his polling at the @entity12 , the nation 's largest labor federation			1
that might seem good for @entity5 , but in modern times , the party always wins voters making $ 50,000 or less			1
for @entity3 , the @entity12 's political director and one of the @entity5 's top thinkers on voter turnout , it 's the spread that matters			1
" @entity5 victories are powered by the votes of the people who are more financially stressed , " @entity3 said in an interview with @entity1 at the labor federation 's @entity0 offices , just up the street from the @entity27			1
" that 's been the case going back to the @entity33			0
when working class people turn out and vote @entity5 , that more than compensates for the advantage that @entity7 have among upper income voters			1
" in other words , with @entity7 dependably winning upper - income @entity38 , it 's up to @entity5 to run up the numbers with downscale voters , who made up about 40 % of the electorate in the last election			1
when democrats clobber @entity7 nationally among working class voters — as they did by 22 points in 2012 — they win			1
when the margin is tighter — it was only an 11 - point win for @entity5 in 2010 — they lose			2
the 55 - 40 lead democrats are clinging to among people making under $ 50,000 is wider than the 50 - 39 lead they had earlier this summer , making this year 's outcome harder to predict			0
@entity3 said it does explain why @entity5 are still in the hunt heading into next tuesday , suggesting that next week 's election wo n't resemble the @entity7 tidal wave of 2010			1
but it still makes him nervous			0
too many @entity5 campaigns have failed to rally their working class base , @entity3 said , choosing instead to run on wedge issues -- like sen. @entity65 's relentless opposition to a personhood amendment in @entity67 -- rather than broader economic populism			1
" it 's very dangerous , " he said			0
" i think that picking niche issues and trying to run on a collection of issues and contrasts in this environment is less effective than mobilizing the voters they need to turn out			0
" " throughout this cycle , polls have shown @entity7 voters to be more enthusiastic , because @entity5 have been taking an approach in general that 's more about slicing into independent voters and into the middle , and has left the base fairly unmotivated , " he said			2
the @entity5 who have nurtured working class voters with an economic message — like @entity87 in @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity90 — are n't getting much national attention , he said , because they have pulled away from their opponents and are n't being covered by the horse - race - obsessed media			1
tight races are not breaking open in the final days , an indicator of " the cynicism and apathy that people have			0
" but even with a motivated base , @entity3 said @entity7 are still not where they would like to be heading into @entity102			2
" it 's really remarkable how many close races there are right now , " he said			0
" and unlike 2010 , republicans are not making inroads into blue territory			0
in 2010 , they were able to win @entity111 races in @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and so forth			0
this time around they may be able to win races like @entity117 or others , but they are not changing the presidential map at all			0
they have their work to do to figure out how to get the map from the way it looks now to a winning map in 2016			0
" @entity3 , an engineer of the progressive movement 's superior voter turnout machinery , said the battle on election day will be about get - out - the - vote mechanics			2
he framed the contest as a test of the @entity7 's " wholesale gotv " — paid media and base enthusiasm in a good @entity7 year — versus the " retail gotv " of the @entity5 coalition that relies on the party 's technological advantages and focuses on person - to - person contact and			2
watch : @entity142 clarifies ' jobs ' remarks the @entity12 's super pac , @entity145 , is part of the field program @entity5 are counting on in tough @entity111 and gubernatorial races in place like @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
" the @entity5 ' retail @entity137 has gotten much , much stronger than in 2010 , when the base was even more disillusioned , " he said			2
" democrats will do a better job on retail gotv , and have more of the personal networks on the ground to pull people out			0
it 's going to be interesting to see how effective that can be			0

@entity12 political director @entity3 is worried about @entity5 ' *standing* with working class voters
