-- in typically collected fashion , @entity2 's triple world champion @entity1 is taking each race as it comes			1
the unflappable @entity6 driver could become only the third driver to win four consecutive championships at this weekend 's @entity10 @entity9 -- following in the footsteps of legendary drivers @entity13 and @entity14			1
but like any great champion , the @entity15 is concentrating on the next grand prix			2
" i 'm not really focusing on the title , i 'm trying to focus on the race , " the 26 - year - old , who is bidding for a fifth consecutive grand prix win at the @entity20 , told @entity0 in @entity21			1
" we have a fantastic car , we are in great shape			0
we have to enjoy that and try our best			0
" in order for @entity1 to be crowned champion this weekend he must take the checkered flag and hope @entity33 's @entity32 -- his nearest rival -- finishes no higher than ninth			2
@entity1 recently suggested the superiority he enjoys over two - time world champion @entity32 could be the reason why he has been booed on the podium at a number of races during the 2013 season			1
his popularity among fans was also dented earlier this year , when he ignored team orders to pass teammate @entity44 and win march 's @entity45			0
while he admits that the booing is disappointing , @entity1 attributes it to sporting rivalry rather than a particular dislike for him or his all - conquering @entity6 team			1
" it 's not nice for sure , " he said			0
" but it 's sport , there is no deep meaning behind it			0
somebody starts , some people join , others do n't			0
it 's not a big deal			0
" @entity1 will get a lift this weekend when he takes to the track at @entity20 , one of his favorite circuits on the @entity2 calendar			1
" it 's one of the best tracks in the world , " he explained , " with all the fast corners , i always enjoy it a lot			2

@entity1 *refuses* to be *distracted* by *thoughts* of a fourth world title
the @entity6 driver can wrap up the @entity2 championship at *sunday* 's @entity10 *gp*
@entity1 admits being booed by *spectators* throughout 2013 has been *unpleasant*
the @entity15 lauds @entity20 as " one of the best tracks in the world "
