-- reclusive author @entity1 has emerged , at least in the pages of court documents , to try to stop a novel that presents @entity5 , the disaffected teen hero of his classic " @entity10 , " as an old man			1
@entity1 has stayed out of the public eye for most of the past half century			1
lawyers for @entity1 filed suit in federal court this week to stop the publication , sale and advertisement of " 60 years later : coming through the @entity26 , " a novel written by an author calling himself @entity20 and published by a @entity22 company that advertises joke books and a " sexual dictionary " on its web site			1
" the sequel infringes @entity1 's copyright rights in both his novel and the character @entity5 , who is the narrator and essence of that novel , " said the suit , filed monday in @entity28 in @entity29			1
published in 1951 , " @entity10 " is an iconic take on teen alienation that is consistently listed among the greatest @entity40 - language novels ever written			0
@entity1 , 90 , who has famously lived the life of a recluse in @entity43 for most of the past half - century , last published in 1965			1
with the exception of a 1949 movie based on one of his early short stories , he has never authorized adaptations of any of his work , even turning down an overture from director @entity52 to make " catcher " into a movie			2
" there 's no more to @entity5			2
it 's all there , " the court filing quotes @entity1 as saying in 1980			1
" @entity5 is only a frozen moment in time			0
" the filing refers to the new book 's author as " @entity63 , " saying that the name @entity65 probably is made up			1
the first - time novelist 's biography on @entity68 says @entity20 is the son of a @entity22 mother and @entity72 father who was named after the state where he was born			2
it claims he is a former gravedigger and triathlete who found a copy of @entity1 's novel " in an abandoned cabin in rural @entity80 " and that it helped him survive " the most maniacal of tropical fevers and chronic isolation			1
" the web site 's description of the book is written in the same choppy , first - person stream of consciousness that @entity1 employs as @entity5 wanders the streets of @entity29			1
it describes a character , " mr. c , " who flees his nursing home and " embarks on a curious journey through the streets of @entity29			2
" the lawsuit names @entity22 publisher @entity97 ; its offshoot , @entity99 ; and @entity20 - based @entity100 as defendants			0
the web site for @entity97 advertises such books as " the @entity104 " and " @entity105 , " which it describes as an erotic " flick book			0
" @entity107 , @entity1 's @entity29 - based attorney , declined to speak on the record , citing her client 's private nature			1
e-mail messages to @entity97 were not returned wednesday			0
@entity112 , president of @entity100 , said the people behind the new book plan to defend it against the lawsuit			0
" we believe we have the right to distribute this book and the publishers believe they have the right to publish it , " he said			0
@entity112 , whose company distributes books by about 150 publishers , called " 60 years later " a work of " social science fiction , " saying that @entity20 does n't plagiarize , but sets a well - known character in an alternate place and time -- as literature has done for centuries			1
" it 's amazing , " he said of the book			0
" if it was something else , or it felt like a knock - off or whatever , i would have told the publisher we would n't do it			0
but it 's really just amazing			0
" despite his cloistered lifestyle , @entity1 nods to the contemporary marketplace in the lawsuit , noting that , as of last week , " ' @entity10 ' currently sells more copies on @entity68 than ' @entity142 , ' ' @entity143 , ' ' @entity144 ' or ' @entity145			1
' " a hearing in the case is expected monday			2
@entity1 's lawyers will ask a judge to freeze publication of the book until a final ruling is made			1
the book is already available in @entity154 and the @entity155 , and is scheduled to be released in the @entity72 in september			0
the lawsuit asks that sales be halted and that books already distributed be recalled and destroyed			0
the argument is reminiscent of the legal tussle over the 2001 novel " @entity161 , " a parody of @entity163 's " @entity166 " told from the perspective of a slave			0
@entity163 's estate argued that the book , by novelist @entity168 , infringed upon her copyright			2
but the 11th @entity171 ruled in @entity173 's favor , saying the book was protected as a parody of a well - known work			0
@entity1 's lawyers say " 60 years later " deserves no such protection			1
" the sequel is not a parody and it does not comment upon or criticize the original , " the lawsuit argues			2
" it is a rip - off pure and simple			0

lawsuit seeks halt to " 60 years later : coming through the @entity26 "
@entity1 says " sequel " infringes on copyright of his classic novel
new author says he 's former gravedigger , discovered " catcher " in @entity80
