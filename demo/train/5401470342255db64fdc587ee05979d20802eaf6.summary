-- what 's the first thing you think of when you think of @entity4 ? the foaming - white sea lapping at a golden - sand beach surrounded by palm trees swaying in the breeze ? well , sure -- @entity4 's one of the world 's ultimate beach destinations , an island paradise made for basking in the sun sipping daiquiris or hitting the waves to surf some righteous tubes			1
but what to do if you 're one of those people who just ca n't stand beaches ? ( scorching sunburn , salt in your hair and sand everywhere ! ) if you 're a beach hater , do n't dismiss @entity4 just yet : there 's plenty to do on the @entity28 where you 'll never have to step foot on sand			2
here are some of our suggestions			0
@entity4 ( the @entity34 ) @entity35 this dormant volcano 's peak is 4205 m ( 13,796 ft ) above sea level -- the highest mountain in the state of @entity4			1
( if you measure from its base underneath the @entity45 , though , it 's 10,000 m ( 33,000 ft ) tall -- making it the tallest mountain on @entity48			1
) with such a clear vantage point , it 's no wonder that its snowy summit is dotted with the greatest collection of astronomical telescopes in the world			2
the @entity56 here offers astronomy displays and nightly stargazing programs to the public			0
experienced mountaineers can even hike 12 miles to the summit through an otherworldly landscape of volcanic cinder cones and ancient archaeological sites			2
@entity65 if you 'd prefer to see some live volcano action , head southeast to this unique national park , where @entity69 , the world 's most active volcano , has been erupting continuously since 1983			1
outside the park boundaries , depending on conditions the day you visit , you may even be able to see fresh molten lava flowing into the sea ( which is slowly but surely making the @entity34 even bigger , year after year )			1
but even if the volcano goddess @entity76 is n't cooperating , there are still plenty of intriguing sights within the park 's confines : hollowed - out lava tubes , steaming craters , tropical rainforest and old lava trails			1
rangers offer guided walks and other activities at the visitor center			2
for information on volcanic activity , the @entity89 has helpful updates ( plus lava cam )			0
@entity94 @entity95 and @entity96 the volcanic soil and sloped pastures of @entity99 have sustained much of @entity95 's farming and livestock for the past two centuries , and the paniolo ( cowboy ) vibe is still strong in towns like rustic @entity107			1
a drive through the plush pastures of the @entity110 will take you past cattle ranches , vineyards with cellar - door sales , goat dairies and a huge lavender farm ( with a cafe and gift shop offering lavender versions of just about any foodstuff or cosmetic product you can imagine -- and even those you ca n't )			1
if you keep driving you can follow a tortuously winding road up the flank of @entity99 itself , up 3055 m ( 10,023 ft ) to the summit , where you can explore the surreal , lunar - like landscape -- home to unique flora such as the ten - year - blooming @entity128 , which grows nowhere else on @entity48 -- and stare down at clouds filling enormous volcanic craters below you			1
if you can get up early ( or stay up late ) enough , book a tour to catch the sublime sight of sunrise from the peak ; you can also have a van take you and a bicycle up to the top so you can ride -- er , roll all the way down			0
@entity139 this colorful town was once the whaling capital of the @entity45 , where ships would dock for supplies , sailors and shore leave			0
today the dance halls , saloons and brothels that kept the whalers busy have been replaced by the best restaurants on @entity95 , art galleries that host free " art nights " every friday , bars with live music from @entity150 trad to jazz and , of course , souvenir shops ( c'mon , it is @entity4 )			2
meanwhile , @entity139 's seafaring past is kept alive by the numerous whale - watching cruises that depart from its harbor			1
@entity165 @entity166 this extinct volcanic tuff cone stands guard over @entity169 , and is @entity165 's signature backdrop			2
you can hike to the top in about an hour or less -- a paved trail leads 1.3 km ( 0.8 miles ) all the way to the summit , which at 232 m ( 760 ft ) affords some pretty awesome views of @entity169			0
( ok , you 'll still have to see a beach , but you wo n't have to step on it			0
happy ? ) @entity179 the tragic events of december 7,1941 are memorialized at @entity181 , just a short drive from downtown @entity183			0
the @entity179 lies where it sank , the resting place of over a thousand of the @entity187 sailors who died in the @entity189 attack			0
in 1962 the memorial was opened , with a structure built over the ship that allows you to view its remains poking out of the shallow water below ; a marble wall inside is engraved with the names of the honored dead			0
a visit to @entity181 will leave you with a palpable sense of the history that was made there			0
@entity203 @entity204 this gigantic chasm at the heart of @entity203 is one of the island 's greatest natural wonders , and its red - and - black - striated lava - rock walls contrasted with the lush green forests that blanket its top is a true sight to behold			1
its name comes from the @entity217 , which runs through the bottom ; the canyon was formed by a combination of erosion and the partial collapse of one of the island 's shield volcanoes			0
@entity204 has lookout points over @entity203 's stunning @entity228 cliffs , as well as numerous hiking trails through and around the canyon , a wilderness lover 's delight			1
helicopter ride over @entity203 way more thrilling than a day at the beach is a helicopter ride over the interior of @entity203 , most of which is too densely forested and mountainous for wheeled vehicles			1
numerous helicopter companies ( most based in @entity242 ) offer up - in - the - air jaunts over waterfall - striped @entity244 , the island 's central shield volcano and one of the wettest spots on @entity48 , and the sheer - hewn sea cliffs of the @entity228 , accessible otherwise only by ocean kayak			1
@entity252 @entity253 @entity254 ( leprosy ) was introduced to @entity4 by foreigners in 1835 , and soon spread through the islands			0
@entity260 , in an attempt to stop the epidemic , created a law banishing all those afflicted to this remote peninsula jutting out from beneath the towering sea cliffs ( the world 's highest ) of @entity252 's north coast , which became the final home for the unhappy exiles			2
around 40 years later , a compassionate @entity270 missionary named @entity271 came to visit , and remained with the colony for 16 years , when he died after contracting the disease himself ( @entity271 was officially canonized by the @entity274 in 2009 )			0
the enforced isolation law was finally revoked in 1969 ; today , only a handful of patients , all senior citizens , remain			0
you can visit the peninsula to see the village and @entity271 's church and gravesite only by pre-arranged tour -- either flying down to the peninsula ( which takes about eight minutes ) or riding a mule down a steep , 2 - mile ( 3.2km ) route zigzagging across the cliffs			2
