-- in @entity3 , an @entity2 party wins the election			1
in @entity8 , statements about adopting @entity6 , or @entity2 law , raise concerns about the future			1
in @entity12 , the @entity11 strategizes about how best to score political gains			0
in the @entity15 , real fears arise that the @entity16 will spawn new states more akin to the principles of @entity19 and @entity20 than fledgling democracies			1
political @entity2 is sure to be a factor as major change sweeps through formerly despotic nations			1
but exactly how is a question that is up for intense debate			0
the idea of political @entity2 raises eyebrows among secularists , women , minority religions who fear their ways of life will come under serious threat if @entity2 parties enforce their will			1
but some caution against looking at @entity2 's role too simplistically -- it is , after all , deeply rooted in the region			1
" @entity44 is basically @entity45 alarmism , " said @entity41 , professor of religion at @entity43			2
" it 's lazy analysis to dredge up images of a @entity52 - like prospect for any country , " he said referring to the @entity47 revolutionary leader			2
so when @entity8 's @entity56 chairman @entity55 announces that any law contradicting @entity2 principles of @entity6 are ineffective , it does n't mean that @entity8 will have hands cut off for stealing or women will be forced to cover up head to toe , @entity41 said			1
what @entity55 's comments will mean in practice has yet to be determined , said @entity66 writer @entity65 in @entity67			0
" it needs to be stressed that each country 's experience will be different			0
" @entity8 's ambassador to the @entity72 , @entity71 , said @entity6 is not necessarily against democracy and equality			1
and @entity55 quickly reassured the international community that @entity8 are moderate @entity2			1
@entity41 said it 's almost impossible to be a leader of a @entity11 nation without paying obeisance to @entity6			0
@entity80 did it in @entity82 ; @entity83 did it in @entity12			0
" it 's like the president of the @entity72 saying , ' @entity87 , ' " @entity41 said			0
" it 's your credibility marker that you are a believer , a way to show religious credentials			0
" in @entity3 , @entity93 , the founder of the winning @entity95 party , is known to be a philosophical thinker drawn to the @entity98 model of governance and faith -- an officially secular country ruled by an @entity103 party			1
@entity98 's constitution limits the public exhibition of religion			1
@entity41 sees @entity98 as a nation that has internalized @entity2 ethics			1
and @entity3 , he said , could do the same , where @entity2 could play a public role but with filters			1
@entity41 , who said he knows @entity93 fairly well , said the @entity95 leader was alarmed when @entity52 issued a death fatwa against author @entity114 after the publication of " @entity116 " -- a novel written by @entity114 that has been decried as blasphemy by some @entity2 fundamentalists			2
@entity95 is not looking to impose @entity6 as it has traditionally been imposed wrote @entity121 columnist @entity120			0
the party 's leadership contends @entity6 is a set of principles open to interpretation , wrote @entity126			1
@entity126 recently met with @entity127 and @entity128 , @entity95 's secretary general , and wrote that both men see @entity6 as a " body of immutable demands			0
" " we know there are some muslims who do not believe in democracy or freedoms in society , " @entity128 told her			2
" we consider this a wrong interpretation			0
for us , the authority in @entity2 is given to the people , and even the legislative power should come from the people			2
" the key is for @entity45 nations to exercise patience , said @entity148 , a professor of @entity2 studies at @entity150			1
" certain parties may have a tendency toward @entity2			2
they may succeed or they may not , " he said			0
" but we have to give them a chance			0
" @entity148 said democracy is a @entity45 ideal that is foreign to many @entity11 nations			2
it took the @entity72 centuries to perfect its own brand of democracy			0
why then , should @entity167 expect @entity3 , @entity8 or @entity12 to achieve perfection overnight , @entity148 asked			1
part of the problem , he said , is that after three decades of hostage taking , terror threats and attacks by @entity2 groups , @entity45 nations now associate @entity2 with unsavory actions and the word @entity2 has taken on a negative connotation			1
" it is important to understand that most muslims in @entity3 , @entity12 and @entity8 want justice , " @entity148 said			1
they want incorruptibility , honesty from their rulers			0
all of them quote @entity2 precedence for these features			2
in the ideal , @entity2 promises that these rulers must have these virtues			2
" @entity41 said he would not be surprised if some time down the line , discordant voices rise up in @entity3 to advocate for what they view as genuine @entity6			2
" one hopes saner voices will slap them down , " he said			0
but it 's that debate that will make the @entity205 world 's post-dictatorship nations a real test for whether @entity6 can ever be reconciled with democracy			1
islamic law , said @entity41 , can be interpreted as a need for providing for the poor , stable governance and implementing a rule of law that is in the best interests of the people			0
" what does @entity6 mean ? " he said			0
" there has not been an honest conversation on what it can be			0
" the answers will help define how the people of the @entity16 try to rebuild their nations .			0

@entity44 is sure to be a factor as change sweeps through @entity205 nations
but can @entity2 law be reconciled with democracy ?
@entity3 's leadership may look to @entity98 as a model
@entity8 reassure the @entity15 they are moderate muslims
