for anyone who 's suffered through severe bouts of malaria , this is the nauseating roller coaster the disease typically wreaks on its victims			1
but now an award - winning innovation by two students in @entity18 could help reduce the devastating impact of the life - threatening disease , which is caused by parasites that are spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes			1

launched by @entity43 students , the @entity40 is a global competition designed to help budding entrepreneurs transform their ideas into businesses that will have a positive social impact			1
@entity41 is made from shea butter , essential lemongrass oil and other ingredients that are still a secret			1
" after using the soap , it leaves on the skin a scent that repels mosquitoes , " says @entity26 , who studies with @entity25 at the @entity52 in @entity53 , the capital of @entity18			1
