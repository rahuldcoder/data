@entity0 -- in what now seems like a fairy tale scenario , friday was supposed to conclude the 112th @entity4 , with members heading home for holiday cheer with their loved ones			2
many were leaving town , including @entity12 speaker @entity11 , but they 'll be back next week as the year - end deadline looms for the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff that economists fear could bring a recession			1
@entity11 , the lead @entity19 negotiator on a possible agreement , met thursday afternoon with president @entity22 at the @entity12 in their second face - to - face talks of the week			1
the 50 - minute meeting that both sides described as " frank " produced no breakthrough on the core issue of whether tax rates will rise on the wealthiest @entity29			1
@entity11 planned to return to his home state of @entity31 for the weekend , but will be available by phone if needed , according to one of his aides			1
he and the rest of the legislators will return monday to work the congressional equivalent of overtime on reaching an agreement to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt by the end of the year -- less than three weeks away			2
@entity12 majority leader @entity44 , @entity45 , is advising members the session could run up to @entity48 , then break for the holiday and resume again before the new year			2
the 113th @entity4 is scheduled to convene on january 3			0
fiscal cliff : it should n't be this hard the inability to reach a deal so far reflects the ideological divide between @entity55 and @entity19 over the size and role of government			1
fears that the negotiations could end without a comprehensive agreement , such as the deficit reduction talks between @entity22 and @entity11 in 2011 , is causing jitters among consumers and investors			1
stock prices fell for a second straight day friday as it became clear neither side appeared willing to budge			0
@entity22 insists on raising additional revenue through tax reform and higher rates on top income brackets as part of a package that would include spending cuts and cost savings from entitlement programs			1
his plan is to extend most of bush - era tax cuts set to expire as part of the fiscal cliff , but letting rates on income over $ 200,000 for individuals and $ 250,000 for families return to higher rates of the 1990s			1
" that 's the best thing for the economy , the best thing for @entity29 families , " @entity22 told @entity88 affiliate @entity87 on thursday			1
" that will take the edge off things			0
we 'll still have to deal with some deficits and debt problems , but it means 98 % of @entity29 , 97 % of small businesses will not see their taxes go up			1
" one simple , controversial fiscal cliff fix @entity11 and @entity19 have reluctantly agreed to some new revenue , but they reject raising anyone 's tax rates and instead propose eliminating deductions and loopholes			1
before meeting @entity22 on thursday , @entity11 told reporters the president has yet to offer a plan that " is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem			1
" @entity19 note that 71 % of every tax dollar now goes to support @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , as well as paying interest on the national debt , and they say the cost of those items would equal all federal tax revenue in 2026 unless changes are made			0
" the president wants to pretend spending is n't the problem , " @entity11 said			2
" that 's why we do n't have an agreement			0
" minutes before he spoke , @entity131 @entity130 argued @entity22 and @entity4 already cut spending in budget battles of the past two years			2
simply cutting more , she said , could hurt the economy			0
@entity135 and @entity136 : here 's how to make a deal " you 're not going to reduce the deficit by ... only cutting your way to it because you will cut the prospects for job creation , which produce revenue , " @entity130 said			0
at the @entity12 , spokesman @entity145 complained @entity19 have n't offered details on which deductions or loopholes they would eliminate to raise revenue			0
regardless , he reiterated @entity22 will agree to a deal only if it involves tax rates going up for the top 2 % of @entity29 and extending tax cuts for all others -- a proposal some @entity19 have said they can accept as a first step to move beyond the deal - breaking dispute			1
@entity22 and @entity55 want @entity11 to hold a vote on the president 's tax plan , which the @entity162 has passed			1
@entity11 avoided a direct answer when asked thursday about a possible vote			2
even @entity165 worried about the ' cliff ' @entity19 reluctance to raise tax rates stems from the conservative quest to shrink government and the percentage of federal spending as part of the overall economy			0
traditionally , raising taxes to fund increased spending is much easier than lowering rates to reduce the money feeding the federal belly			0
@entity55 argue that @entity19 efforts to reduce federal deficits through cost - cutting alone would worsen an already difficult situation for middle - class @entity29 facing stagnant wages , rising costs and reduced opportunity			2
in particular , @entity55 consider entitlement programs to be the foundation of the social contract with @entity29 and therefore question pushes to cut them			2
instead , they insist the programs can be strengthened through improved efficiency and other reforms , such as the $ 700 billion in @entity116 savings under @entity22 's 2010 health care reform law			2
polls consistently show the public favors @entity22 's position of raising taxes on wealthy @entity29 in order to minimize cuts			1
by the numbers : fiscal cliff nearly half of @entity29 -- 49 % -- approve the president 's handling of the talks , compared with 25 % who say @entity11 is doing a good job , according to an @entity212 / @entity211 poll released wednesday			1
meanwhile , a @entity213 found nearly two - thirds of respondents , including nearly 50 % of @entity19 , believe @entity22 's re-election gave him a mandate to seek higher taxes on the wealthy			1
regardless of which side of the debate citizens fall , experts agree almost everyone will be affected if a deal is n't struck			0
two former @entity162 majority leaders said thursday both sides must be ready to compromise			0
" the simplest way to put it is that we 're at 24 % spending , we 're at 16 % revenue , " said @entity135 , a former @entity55 senator from @entity226			0
" we 've got to bring those two closer together , and that 's how you get a balanced budget , and ultimately that 's how you get fiscal responsibility			0
... it can be done			0
" to @entity136 , a former @entity19 senator from @entity238 , it comes down to the principal negotiators			0
" there 'll come a moment when the speaker ... and the president will have to make a decision , " @entity136 said			2
" but they need to do it in concert			0
" it 's like directing the orchestra			0
you 've got to have the winds and the brass come together , and they 're not quite there			0
" how is the fiscal cliff affecting you ? @entity1 's @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 contributed to this report .			1
