-- @entity2 's new military ruler has added a personal touch to his junta 's post-coup charm offensive , penning the lyrics to a patriotic ballad vowing to " return happiness " to the country			1
performed by the @entity13 band , the song , " return happiness to @entity2 , " has so far racked up more than 200,000 views on @entity15 since it was released on friday			1
it is played regularly on @entity2 radio and television and has featured at the military 's goodwill concerts around the country			0
colonel @entity21 , head of the @entity13 band , was quoted in @entity2 media as saying gen. @entity23 had rattled off the lyrics , in his own handwriting , in about an hour			1
the song includes the couplet : " let us be the ones who step in before it is too late / to bring back love , how long will it take ? " since the may 22 coup d'etat , the country 's 12th in 82 years , @entity2 's junta has embarked on an unprecedented pr campaign to win hearts and minds in a divided country			1
the @entity41 , as the regime calls itself , has held public festivals featuring mini-skirted dancers , free haircuts , petting zoos and stands where the attendees can take " selfies " with soldiers			2
on sunday , the regime is promising free tickets to screenings of a patriotic movie across the country			1
@entity54 , a political science professor at @entity56 's @entity55 , said the pr campaign was far more intense than those following previous coups			1
" earlier coups did not require as much pr campaigning because public expectations and media tools of scrutiny at home and abroad were less pervasive and powerful , " he said			2
the campaign has been conducted under the banner of " happiness			1
" on friday , @entity23 delivered the first of a planned weekly tv and radio broadcast , " returning happiness to the @entity77 , " in which he repeatedly struck on the concept while outlining his junta 's vision			1
" we need to solve many issues ; from administration to the budget system , corruption , and even the starting point of democracy itself -- the election			0
parliamentary dictatorship has to be removed			0
all these have caused conflict and unhappiness among @entity2 people , " he said , in comments questioning whether @entity2 was ready for democracy			0
" we intend to return happiness to everyone living in @entity2			1
" watch : @entity2 protesters reference @entity98 movies but the cheery overtures have been accompanied by an unrelenting crackdown on dissent , with hundreds of people rounded up , including academics , journalists , activists and politicians			2
the junta has urged government officials to identify potential troublemakers among their colleagues , and issued warnings about liking dissenting posts on social media or flashing the three - fingered anti-coup salute co-opted from the @entity98 films			2
@entity116 , a @entity2 associate professor of @entity117 at @entity118 , described the happiness campaign as a " gimmick , " and a " very crude form of populism " that was unlikely to work			2
" i do n't think the majority of @entity124 will buy into this happiness project , because there is nothing to be happy about when your basic human rights have been taken away , when you can not even express how you feel in public peacefully , " he said			1
" the reality is they 're continuing to hunt down and harass people			0
happiness versus a climate of fear -- it does n't go together			0
" @entity54 said he believed the campaigning might help the regime , but only in the short - term			0
" initially , the hearts - and - minds campaigns will seem to hold promise because of the complete dominance of the new regime and the lack of alternatives , " he said			0
" but it would be surprising if these superficial and manufactured approaches succeed in resolving such deep - seated conflicts that have built up over many years			0
