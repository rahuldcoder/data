-- until 2011 , we were in a @entity3 - world			1
events unfolded so fast that every morning , we seemed to wake up in circumstances unrecognizably transformed from those of the previous night			2
yet this year has broken the mold			1
nothing happened : certainly , nothing worthy of record by an historian like me			2
you can imagine the almanac - writers ' dilemma as they prepare copy for @entity17 , struggling to make the year seem memorable			1
they 'll headline @entity21 's death , but he was a has - been who had ceased to influence history and whose death can make no difference to our world except by adding one more item to @entity29 ' already tedious list of grievances			1
newspapers will parade pictures of the @entity34 , which dethroned @entity35 in favor of @entity35			2
recycled photo montages will revive the embarrassment of an expensive wedding in @entity43 , in which a prince of feeble attainments played a bit part in a show dominated by trash celebrities			0
the death of @entity48 will get little coverage -- partly because few good pictures will be available , partly because it really does n't matter			0
the @entity52 talks on climate change hardly merit a mention : they confirmed not only that environmental change is now out of human control but also that no one is prepared to make real , urgent effort to try to do anything about it			1
the @entity68 " drawdown " from @entity69 may get some deserved applause , but it has come too late to make much difference to the long - term misfortunes of a war that was worse than a crime , because it was also a mistake			1
pundits will reissue dire pronouncements about the @entity73 debt crisis , but it already looks as if i was right , when the crisis broke , to predict in @entity78 and @entity79 media that the euro will emerge barely scathed , with the @entity81 , if anything , marginally strengthened			0
politicians have supplied some real - life comic opera to enliven the generally cheerless , pointless record			1
@entity85 added " bumpa - bumpa " to the world 's lexicon			1
@entity89 entertained us with his impersonation of the gait and patience of a @entity95 cockerel			0
@entity96 devised amusing excuses to escape jail			0
politicians ' posturings reached new heights of self - ridicule when @entity107 , a noisy mountebank , whose gestures always seem to have the impact of a feebly flung custard pie , called president @entity108 a clown			2
the @entity68 congressional impasse did only modest harm to @entity68 but made the country a world - wide laughing - stock			2
the inane antics of @entity116 presidential candidates brought smiles to the faces of @entity68 recession victims			0
@entity120 could n't remember which departments he wanted to abolish			0
@entity122 revealed unexpected depths in the sex life of a pizza guy			0
even @entity126 and @entity127 became funny in a desperate sort of way when @entity116 voters turned to the unelectable twins in revulsion from all the other options			0
but the candidates ' parade seemed mainly to show the poverty of democracy and the shallowness of voters ' morals			0
members of the debate audiences bayed for the blood of death - row inmates and uninsured hospital patients			2
state legislatures courted the votes of the hateful and resentful by victimizing poor immigrants and their innocent children			0
2011 ought to have been a great year			1
@entity151 could have unlocked the bank vaults and reversed recession			0
punishment could have made an example of the guilty men of the global economic crisis , but the fat cats have gone on gorging			2
@entity161 could have gutted corruption out of the @entity68 political system -- but the 2012 election will be like all the others , bought by millions of dollars , abandoned by millions of voters			1
@entity167 could have rejoined civilization , but , instead , the irrational alienation of @entity167 has continued			0
imaginative initiatives could have helped to reverse the clash of civilizations , but inter-communal violence has gone on accumulating			0
i relish unmemorable years : they make it easier for me to update my textbook on the history of the world			1
they absolve me from further work			0
but , on the scale of those of 2011 , missed opportunities are bad for all of us			1
the year 's non-events have , at least , taught us two truths			2
first , the global political system is sclerotic			1
the inertia of the @entity68 government , with decision - making deadlocked and almost every program frozen -- the promising and menacing alike -- seems representative of a world baffled into pusillanimity by the scale of its problems , while the feebleness of the @entity81 's response to the financial crisis has shown the same sort of freeze - framing , in a system too clogged with complexity to function			1
@entity207 , 2011 , like other unremarkable years , has confirmed the already dominant features of the history of our day : intractable economic stagnation , moral and intellectual torpor , tacky culture , environmental degradation			1
we can congratulate ourselves , as we head into 2012 , only on escaping the infamous old @entity216 curse : we do not live in interesting times			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 : for all its sound , fury , 2011 was a year in which little changed
he says @entity21 was a has - been who had ceased to influence history
no real progress on *reform* of economy or global political system , he says
author : opportunities were missed to make 2011 a *pivotal* year
