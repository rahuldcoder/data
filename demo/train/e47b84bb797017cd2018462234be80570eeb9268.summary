@entity0 -- @entity2 is an elite @entity0 firefighter			1
he is also a highly decorated officer in the @entity3 , who has served four tours in @entity6 and @entity7			1
so why is maj. @entity2 facing possible discharge on less than honorable terms after serving 13 years with the @entity10 ? he is accused of mishandling classified information and faces an investigation that could determine his future			1
" for a man like @entity2 , being asked to separate from the @entity10 that he loved so much would be an even worse punishment than jail , " said @entity14 , @entity2 's attorney , a former @entity15 officer who is providing @entity2 pro bono representation along with his law firm @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 & @entity21			1
in an e-mail to @entity1 , @entity10 col. @entity25 wrote that because of " the mishandling of classified information , maj. @entity2 has been ordered to show cause of retention in the @entity3 before a @entity29			1
" that board will consist of three officers : one colonel and two lieutenant colonels			0
@entity2 , a tall man with a strong @entity0 accent and a blond buzz - cut , is legally barred from speaking about his case			1
but influential supporters are leaping to the 32 - year - old veteran 's defense			1
a congressman , a senator and two @entity10 generals have written letters on @entity2 's behalf			1
none of his defenders dispute the fact that @entity2 broke security protocol when he sent classified information over an insecure line in summer 2012			1
in fact , his attorney said @entity2 quickly reported the mistake to his superiors			2
his defenders argue the urgency of the situation warranted the security breach			0
" maj. @entity2 was in a position where lives were in danger and time was of the essence , and in the end his assessment of the threat proved accurate , " wrote @entity0 sen. @entity60 in a letter to the @entity10			2
during summer 2012 , @entity2 was attending graduate courses in @entity71 when he received an e-mail from @entity10 officers in @entity7 's @entity75 province , a deeply troubled area where @entity2 had been deployed in 2009 - 2010			1
" the subject line of the e-mail he received said in all capital letters with three exclamation marks ' important : @entity81 is back , ' " said @entity14			0
@entity2 had history with @entity83 , an @entity7 police commander who had been active in @entity75			1
" when @entity2 was serving in @entity7 in 2010 , he caused @entity83 , a police official , to be fired from that position because he was raping children , " @entity14 said			1
despite repeated efforts by @entity1 's bureau in @entity89 , @entity83 could not be found to comment for this report			0
@entity14 said " within minutes " @entity2 wrote his colleagues back at @entity92 in @entity7 , with a warning about jan. he attached to the e-mail a classified document that included allegations about @entity83 , claiming he had ties to the @entity98			1
" @entity2 immediately responded with everything he knew , including some extraordinarily derogatory information he knew about this man indicating that he was a threat not only to local children but to @entity10 , " @entity14 said			1
" when the @entity10 in @entity7 wrote back saying that some of that information might have been classified , ( @entity2 ) immediately turned himself in			1
" in retrospect , some observers believe this was a breach of security that could have saved lives			0
on august 10 , 2012 , less than two weeks after @entity2 's warning , three @entity10 were shot to death in the gym at @entity92			1
their names were staff sgt. @entity116 , cpl. @entity117 and @entity119 @entity118			0
the suspected gunman was a teenage servant , known by the single @entity7 name @entity122 , who was working on the base for jan. despite his earlier dismissal , @entity83 had been appointed to command the @entity7 police in another district of @entity75 , where @entity92 was located			2
more than a year later , @entity118 's home in @entity128 , @entity0 , is decorated with @entity130 flags and photos in honor of the slain 21 - year old			1
asked what would have happened if commanders at @entity92 heeded @entity2 's warning , @entity133 paused , his eyes filling with tears			1
" i would have my son , " he said			0
" i would have my boy with me today			0
" before the shooting , @entity133 said that his son had warned him over the phone about the @entity7 police commander named jan. " he told me that ( @entity83 ) was a bad person , " the elder @entity118 said			2
" they all knew that he was a bad guy			0
he was thrown out of two other bases prior to this for drug laundering , prostitution and ties to the @entity98 , " he said			0
in the aftermath of the shooting , @entity83 was detained by @entity7 security forces , according to an august 2012 report in the @entity155			2
despite repeated requests for information , @entity7 officials both in the @entity75 provincial government and in the @entity158 of the national government in @entity89 told @entity1 they had no information about either @entity83 or @entity122 's current whereabouts			1
meanwhile , more than 14 months after the deadly shooting , @entity130 investigators have yet to publish the results of their inquiry			0
" the case is still open , pending prosecution by the @entity173 , " wrote @entity168 , a spokesman for @entity169 , in an e-mail to @entity1			0
military experts and government officials are questioning why it has taken so long to release a report			0
" generally , investigations are conducted a lot more quickly , " said rep. @entity178 , a @entity179 from @entity0			0
last month , @entity178 sent a letter to the @entity183 asking investigators to answer several questions , including : -- did @entity83 commit sex crimes against juveniles while on @entity183 facilities ? -- did @entity83 use @entity130 government funds to procure his victims ? -- why was @entity83 reportedly dismissed as district police chief ? why was he reappointed ? instead of getting answers , @entity178 said he saw action being taken against @entity2			1
" the only person who 's being penalized , or potentially punished , is the person who tried to warn the @entity10 , " the congressman said			0
" i can not possibly understand it			0
" @entity2 's case has been taken up by the @entity198 , the newspaper that first broke the story of the major 's legal troubles			2
" @entity2 's treatment sends the messages that in the @entity10 there 's no room for honest mistakes , " the @entity198 wrote in a recent editorial			2
" he 's the sort of officer the @entity3 needs more of , " it read			0
@entity210 , father of the slain @entity10 , agrees : " they should be giving him a medal , not prosecuting him			0
" the @entity10 declined to comment further on @entity2 's case			2
@entity25 said the silence was vital to avoid influencing the officers the major is expected to face at his board of inquiry next month			0
the hearing , which could take a few hours or a few days depending on the number of witnesses called , will end with an immediate recommendation by the board			0
depending on the evidence presented , there are several options open to the board			0
the three officers could recommend either an honorable discharge or a less - than - honorable discharge			2
the latter could result in a loss of veteran 's benefits , including free health care			1
the secretary of the navy would need to give a final stamp of approval on that decision			0
if the board recommends no action against @entity2 , the decision is final .			2

@entity2 faces possible discharge on less than honorable terms
he served for 13 years , including four tours in @entity6 and @entity7
