-- history , we are told , is immutable			2
what has happened can not be changed and , when lessons are not heeded , is doomed to repeat itself			0
the entertainment industry , however , has been known to tamper with our historical memories , changing them to fit a story or to create an entirely alternate version of history			1
developers at @entity12 decided to leave real history alone but explore its gray , murky areas where creative license can still exist in their upcoming video game , " @entity17 " ( it 's set for release october 30 in @entity19			1
) the latest game in the action - adventure series is set during the tumultuous times of the @entity23			1
the young nation that would become the @entity25 is just forming and trying to establish itself as independent from the @entity29 monarchy			1
with redcoats on one side and a wild frontier on the other , colonists want the ability to determine their own fate without the crown taking its pound of flesh ( or , for that matter , tea )			0
stepping into this historical arena for a video game could be problematic since the time period is so well - known and the men and women of the time are revered for their accomplishments			1
@entity48 , lead game designer for " @entity17 , " said there was a lot of pressure to make sure they got the history right			1
" we 're treating these characters with respect , " he said			0
" we have so much information about how these people were thinking , what they were thinking , what they were feeling , how they felt about the revolution			2
we were able to portray these characters accurately and give the history the service it deserves			2
" @entity48 said the abundance of knowledge about the era actually creates problems for game makers			1
instead of rehashing what has already happened in a simulation - type game , " @entity17 " aims for the gray areas of history and focuses on events that may not have a clear - cut explanation			1
with @entity77 and online searches , it would n't take much effort to pinpoint historical inaccuracies in the game			2
what developers aimed for were moments in time that are less clear or perhaps have conflicting histories			0
masters gives an example of a soldier who died on the battlefield			0
" was he shot ? was he stabbed ? was it friendly fire ? that sort of thing allows us to go in and insert our version of the history and tell our story , " he said			2
that 's not to say major historical events wo n't be represented in the game			1
players will be involved in such iconic events as the @entity105 and the battle at @entity107			0
masters credits having a historian on staff during the development process for keeping them on track and not letting them take too many liberties			0
historian @entity116 worked with @entity12 for more than three years to include and accurately represent key elements of history			2
while his expertise was @entity124 history , his knowledge of the time period in @entity25 history was exactly what they were looking for			1
because the main character , @entity127 , is of mixed heritage ( half @entity128 , half @entity29 ) , he also looked into the @entity130 culture from that time to help develop the character			1
" we took a look at all the different tribes that were close to @entity135 and @entity136 in the period , " @entity116 said			0
" we decided to choose @entity138 because they were the most interesting that appeared during the revolution			1
we worked with members of the tribe because we wanted to be appropriate , be respectful as well as be historic			2
" @entity48 said it was important to be accurate with the @entity138 history because it serves as the basis for @entity127 's motivations			1
there is an entire sequence of the game spoken in the @entity138 language , and @entity127 's village is represented as well			1
" considering the general treatment of @entity128 in video gaming , i think we 've got one of the strongest and most accurately portrayed characters that has ever been created , " he said			0
" i 'm really excited to let people see that and bring that to the front			0
" @entity116 worked on making @entity136 and @entity135 , two of the major locations in the game , as accurate to the period as possible using old maps and building drawings from the era			1
he thinks players could just wander around in those cities and be amazed at all the detail in the look and feel of the areas			0
people in those cities also react to in - game events that have recently transpired			1
" if you 've just played the @entity180 sequence , in the next sequence people are already talking about that event and offering a point of view about that , " @entity116 said			0
besides offering historical knowledge to help build the story , @entity116 also had to keep in mind the game franchise 's back story -- a never - ending battle between the @entity192 and assassins			1
" we wanted to explain events in our own way , " he said			0
" the outcome was always the way history showed it , but how it got there may be a bit different			2
" " we 're about reliving history , " @entity48 added			2
" we 're about going to those moments and seeing them happen through the history behind the known history			2
" to bring such a vast , historically rich time period to life , the team needed to have something with more power to represent the huge battles during the revolution from the perspective of @entity127			0
the game features a new engine called @entity218 , which allows for greater resolution and more elements on screen at one time			0
" to re-create @entity107 , that was going to take a completely different technology , " masters said			0
" you want to be there and experience it			0
you want the grandeur of that massive battle happening around you			0
" @entity218 also helped them accurately represent naval battles ( which are new to the series ) in the @entity232 and dynamic weather conditions , both of which played critical roles in history and could not have been done with their previous game engine			1
@entity48 said his team really wanted to do everything possible to immerse the player in the era as fully as possible so they could feel like they were taking a " historical vacation			0
" " it 's a chance for people to go and experience the history in a way you ca n't from just reading a book or listening to a lecture , " he said			1
" the power of interactivity allows us storytelling potential for an interesting and compelling way to hear these stories			0

" @entity17 " puts @entity25 history on center stage
designers built a revolution - era @entity19 without changing the big picture
