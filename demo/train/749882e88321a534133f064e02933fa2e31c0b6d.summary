-- @entity2 host @entity1 revealed on her show that a recent on - air mammogram had found she has breast cancer , but the diagnosis would n't have been made if she followed certain federal guidelines for screening			1
@entity1 is 40 , and the @entity9 , a group of independent experts convened by the government to review the risks and benefits of different screening practices , advised in 2009 that as a public health measure , the benefits of saving lives would outweigh the risks of screening if women started getting yearly checks beginning at age 50 , rather than at age 40 , as the @entity24 and other groups advise			1
the task force based its conclusion on the potential costs , both economic and emotional , of uncertain mammogram results , which would lead to follow up tests including biopsies and procedures like lumpectomies and mastectomies , most of which , the studies they investigated showed , ended up being negative			2
but maximizing public health and decreasing harm may be at odds with minimizing an individual woman 's risk of dying of breast cancer			2
and that 's the situation that " we see every day in my field , " says dr. @entity49 , a breast cancer expert at @entity51			0
" we see real human beings getting screening mammograms so their cancer is detected at stages when we have curative treatments , " @entity49 continues			1
" when people talk about the downsides of screening , it does n't compute in the minds of people who are actually in contact with human beings			0
" @entity0 : @entity2 's @entity1 reveals on - air test led to breast cancer diagnosis @entity1 wrote on @entity2 's website that she has " very little family history " of the disease , and " considered it virtually impossible that i would have cancer			1
" she only agreed to get the mammogram live on air , at the request of her producers and colleague @entity74 , herself a cancer survivor			1
had she followed the @entity9 guidelines , which some doctors do , and upon which some insurers base reimbursement decisions , she might not have gotten a mammogram for another decade			1
" i do n't want to imagine what could have happened if she had her first mammogram at age 50 , " says @entity49 of @entity1 's case			1
and that 's why , despite the public health advice , most doctors still recommend that their patients start getting regular mammograms when they turn 40			1
it 's not that they are being ornery , or stubborn to change , but that there 's a biological mandate to find potential tumors in younger women early			0
for one , the idea that the stage at which a cancer is detected , which has a lot to do with its size , determined a woman 's prognosis , are fading away			0
what truly matters is the biology of the tumor itself -- understanding how it grows , what it feeds on , and whether it 's driven by genetic factors -- is far more predictive of whether a woman will survive a breast cancer or not			0
" younger women tend to get aggressive tumors that are quicker growing and not fed by estrogen , " says dr. @entity114 , a breast cancer specialist at @entity116			2
the concept of cancers growing slowly over years is more typical of older women who are past menopause than younger women in their 40s			0
there 's also growing evidence that in breast cancer , tumors start to send out signals to other parts of the body to prime them for metastatic growths			2
" the lungs change before the first cancer ( from the breast ) gets there , " says @entity49 , " and the lungs become a fertile field so when the first cancer does get there , it 's ready to grow			0
and that 's a time dependent process , so the earlier you intervene , you can stop the process of metastasis			0
" and once a cancer has spread , it 's much more likely to be deadly			0
@entity0 : mammogram guidelines : what you need to know why is the @entity9 conclusion so at odds with the breast cancer care that most doctors practice every day ? part of the problem may be that the studies the task force included involved older mammogram machines that did not provide the digital images that newer machines do , with better resolution and multiple views of the breast tissue to more accurately identify potential tumors			1
the task force guidelines did not rule out mammograms for women under age 50 ; women with a family history of the disease , or other risk factors such as exposure to environmental estrogens , being on the pill or drinking alcohol should talk to their doctors about starting screening earlier , the members said			1
the decision about when to start screening , says @entity114 , should really be a personalized one , made by a woman and her doctor , after factoring in her medical history			1
and for now , that conversation is likely to be an involved and difficult one , but will hopefully become easier as better methods for detecting the first signs of breast tumors become available			0
" screening is going to evolve , and we will have not just imaging but biologic tests such as biomarkers , " she says			0
" would n't it be great to have a blood test , or be able to spit into a cup and then know whether you have cancer , and you would n't have to go through unnecessary biopsies ? " study questions benefit of yearly mammograms that day may be coming , but it 's not here yet			2
in the meantime , women like @entity1 have to make their own decisions about when to start screening			1
they also have to understand that the risk factors for cancer do n't always stand up and shout and make themselves obvious			2
@entity1 decided to undergo a double mastectomy to treat her disease , and wrote that " i got lucky by catching it early			2
i can only hope my story will ... inspire every woman who hears it to get a mammogram , to take a self exam			0
it is the difference between life and death			0

@entity1 is 40 ; federal guidelines recommend yearly checks at 50
her cancer was found in an on - air mammogram
women should make their own decisions about when to start screening
