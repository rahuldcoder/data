@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 have hired a prominent conservative attorney to defend the federal @entity5 in a pending lawsuit , legal sources say , and will make an effort to divert money from the @entity10 to fund its high - profile fight			1
house speaker @entity12 disclosed the legal and political strategy in a letter monday to @entity3 minority leader @entity15			1
the @entity17 administration , which normally would defend federal laws in judicial disputes , announced last month it believed the @entity5 , often referred to as @entity5 , to be unconstitutional			1
the law defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman			0
@entity12 said that with the @entity10 not participating , he had " no choice " but to act unilaterally			1
" the burden of defending @entity5 , and the resulting costs associated with any litigation that would have otherwise been born ( sic ) by @entity10 ( the @entity10 ) , has fallen to the @entity3 , " @entity12 said			1
" obviously , @entity10 's decision results in @entity10 no longer needing the funds it would have otherwise expended defending the constitutionality of @entity5			1
it is my intent that those funds be diverted to the @entity3 for reimbursement of any costs incurred by and associated with the @entity3 , and not @entity10 , defending @entity5			1
" such a move would require @entity40 approval , an unlikely prospect since @entity42 control that chamber			0
@entity12 will probably end up finding money for the legal fight from other discretionary and non-discretionary spending sources , according to legal experts			1
there was no indication just how much the legal fight could eventually cost			1
in response to @entity12 's letter , @entity15 , @entity55 , asked the speaker how much the legal defense of @entity5 would cost taxpayers			1
" i am requesting that you disclose the cost of hiring outside counsel for the 12 cases where @entity5 is being challenged , " @entity15 's letter said			1
she also asked for details on the reported hiring of @entity66 , a former solicitor general , specifically when a contract was signed and why a copy was not provided to @entity42 on the @entity69			1
legal sources say the @entity3 @entity2 leadership hired @entity66 , a @entity0 appellate attorney , to defend the law			1
he filed a brief monday in a pending case from @entity74 , where a lesbian received an estate tax bill of more than $ 360,000 after her longtime partner and legal wife had died			2
@entity66 is a former solicitor general under president @entity79 , serving from 2005 to 2008			1
it was his job to defend federal laws and executive actions in court , similar to what he will be doing now as a private lawyer on retainer			0
he was mentioned at one time as a possible @entity88 nominee			0
separately , he also is representing more than two dozens states in their lawsuit against the administration over the sweeping health care reform law passed by @entity93 last year			2
that case is pending in a federal appeals court in @entity96			0
in the @entity5 dispute , groups on both sides of the issue noted the highly charged political aspects			0
" not only are @entity3 @entity2 leaders defending the indefensible , they 've brought in a high - priced attorney to deny federal recognition to loving , married couples , " said @entity102 , president of the @entity103			1
" speaker @entity12 appears ready to go to great lengths , and the great expense of a high - power law firm , to try to score some cheap political points on the backs of same - sex couples			1
" but conservative groups applauded the move			0
" at last we have a legal eagle on this case who actually wants to win in court , " said @entity117 , president of the @entity118			2
" thanks to speaker @entity12 's actions , president @entity17 's attempt to sabotage the legal defense of @entity5 is not going to work			1
" president @entity17 on february 23 ordered the @entity10 to stop defending the constitutionality of the law			1
" the president has concluded that given a number of factors , including a documented history of discrimination , classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny , " said attorney general @entity131			2
the key provision in the law " fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional			0
" @entity17 had previously expressed his personal opposition to the @entity5 but had never stated an opinion relating to its constitutionality			2
@entity131 's chief spokesman said the department had no comment on @entity12 's moves			2
two pending lawsuits from @entity74 and @entity152 challenge the law			0
the 2nd @entity155 @entity154 , which includes both states , is the only federal circuit to have never decided the basic legal question of whether a law discriminates against gay men and lesbians			2
the @entity5 was passed in 1996 by the @entity2 - controlled @entity93 and signed into law by president @entity163			2
it bars federal recognition of same - sex marriages and says states can not be forced to recognize such marriages allowed in other states			0
the @entity74 legal fight was prompted by @entity171 , who lived with her female partner , @entity171 , for more than four decades			1
they married out - of - state in 2007 , but neither the federal government nor their home state of @entity74 recognized the legal union			2
@entity178 died and left her estate to @entity171 , who was then forced to pay taxes on the money because she was not considered a legal spouse			0
in july , a federal judge in @entity186 , in a separate case , became the first to rule part of the @entity5 unconstitutional			0
district judge @entity188 said that " irrational prejudice plainly never constitutes a legitimate government interest			0
" the administration 's decision comes on the heels of other major developments in the struggle over gay and lesbian rights			0
in december , @entity17 signed legislation that will repeal the controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and bring an end to the ban on openly gay men and women serving in the armed forces			2
courts in @entity55 are considering a legal challenge to @entity206 , an initiative narrowly approved by that state 's voters in 2008			0
it defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman			0
either one of those cases could reach the @entity88 in coming months , perhaps in time to become a major issue during the 2012 election year			0
same - sex marriage is legal in five states -- @entity152 , @entity219 , @entity186 , @entity220 and @entity221 -- and in the @entity0			0
civil unions virtually equivalent to marriage are permitted in @entity224 , while several other states offer more limited civil unions or partnerships			0
the @entity74 case is @entity171 v. @entity155 ( 1:10 - cv - 08435 ) .			0

new : @entity15 asks what the legal fight will cost taxpayers
attorney @entity66 was solicitor general in the second @entity79 administration
@entity12 says he had no choice but to act after the @entity17 administration backed off
@entity3 @entity2 also want to divert @entity10 funds for the effort
