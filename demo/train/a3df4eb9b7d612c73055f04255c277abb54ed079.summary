@entity0 -- @entity2 , a 6 - year - old @entity4 boy , has traveled with his parents to @entity6 seeking treatment for a rare genetic condition that has left him developmentally disabled			1
you might think this was a hopeful mission until you learn that an overwhelming number of medical experts insist the treatment will have zero effect			2
he walks with the aid of braces			0
to battle his incurable condition , which is so rare it does n't have a name , @entity17 has had to take an artificial growth hormone for most of his life			2
his divorced parents , @entity26 and @entity27 , are so driven by their hope and desperation to help cash they 've journeyed to the other side of the globe and paid tens of thousands of dollars to have @entity17 undergo experimental injections of human embryonic stem cells			1
the family is among a growing number of @entity36 seeking the treatment in @entity6 -- some at a clinic in the heart of @entity0 called @entity40 run by dr. @entity41 , a retired obstetrician and self - taught embryonic stem cell practitioner			1
@entity41 first treated @entity17 -- who presents symptoms similar to @entity45 -- in 2010			1
" i am helping improve their quality of life , " @entity41 told @entity1			2
after five weeks of treatment , @entity17 and his parents returned home to the @entity36 that 's when @entity17 began walking with the aid of braces for the first time			2
before the treatments , @entity17 could only get around by hopping , his mother said			0
the results were enough to persuade @entity17 's mother to go back to @entity41 for more help			1
" we saw evidence the first time that it 's worth trying again , " @entity27 said			2
" in this particular case , with @entity17 's other conditions , we do n't have many other options			2
" for four or five weeks of treatment , @entity41 says she has charged her 87 @entity36 patients an average of $ 25,000			1
it 's a big financial hit for @entity26 , a volunteer firefighter and property manager , and @entity27 , who attends technical college in @entity75 , @entity4			0
but the boy 's family and friends went into fundraising mode , creating a blog called @entity81 , and amassing about $ 50,000 over a year			2
are patients like @entity17 truly receiving treatments that improve their quality of life ? or is therapy giving patients false hope ? doctors say all that work and hope and money @entity17 's supporters have funneled into his experimental therapy likely will have no medical benefits			1
there are several types of stem cells			0
adult stem cells can be found in mature cells and some organs			0
for example , bone marrow cells are a type of adult stem cell that have been used in transplants for more than 40 years			1
but because adult stem cells are taken from parts of the body that already have a purpose , they may be limited as to what they can be turned into			0
embryonic stem cells are the controversial ones because they 're harvested from leftover @entity117 embryos , which are then destroyed in the process			1
embryonic stem cells come from 4 - or 5 - day - old fertilized eggs and have the ability to turn into any type of cell in the body			1
since human embryonic stem cells were first discovered in 1998 , researchers have been trying to take these unique cells and coax them into becoming cells for every part of the body , which then could be used to repair damage or regenerate tissue			1
for many years a virtual ban on funding this type of research slowed the field down			0
researchers have developed another source of stem cells : skin cells			0
scientists learned to turn the clock back on skin cells so they 're like embryos -- with stem cells that have the same " blank slate " properties like embryonic stem cells -- but without the controversy			1
these cells are called " @entity150 " ( induced pluripotent stem ) cells -- and are not yet being used in human experiments			2
there are no approved embryonic stem cell treatments in the @entity36			1
however , the @entity155 has approved two experimental clinical trials in humans using treatments made from human embryonic stem cells			1
one of these -- to repair spinal cord injuries -- was stopped due to the high cost of this type of research ; the other trial -- to restore vision in people with macular degeneration -- is still underway			0
there is hope that embryonic stem cells might someday lead to treatments for @entity172 , diabetes , traumatic spinal cord injury , duchenne muscular dystrophy and other conditions , according to the @entity177			1
nevertheless , @entity41 is n't waiting for further research			2
she 's injecting patients with embryonic stem cells now			1
" there is zero evidence for what she is doing being effective , " said @entity182 's dr. @entity181 , a leading @entity36 neuroscientist			2
" it 's concerning no matter how you look at it , " said @entity1 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity186			2
" frankly it 's the complete wrong way of going about this sort of science			0
" inside her clinic , surrounded by patients , @entity41 disagreed			1
" success , " she said , " is defined differently by various groups of people within that therapy mode			2
so as of right now , almost everyone -- greater than 90 % -- have had success			1
" but @entity17 's family has its doubters , too			0
the boy 's father said he still is n't totally convinced the treatment works			2
" if we had taken away the stem cells and had n't done it , is this where he would be naturally ? " @entity26 said			0
" and that 's where i keep coming back to is -- i 'm not sure			2
" " it 's risky medical therapy , " acknowledged @entity27 , who feared it would worsen @entity17 's condition			1
" but i knew that we were going to have to do it			0
we did pick this clinic for a reason			0
i mean , we did look around , and we decided this is the place where we felt safe			0
she had a good track record			0
" an energetic doctor who trained in @entity6 , @entity41 says she acquired embryonic stem cells with the patient 's permission after she performed an in - vitro fertilization procedure on a woman more than a decade ago			1
she would not allow @entity1 access to the facility where she says the embryonic cells are kept and harvested			0
nurses and assistants at @entity40 routinely inject patients with embryonic stem cells daily simply by sticking the needle into a patient 's back			1
the routine at the clinic starkly contrasts with procedures @entity1 observed at a sanctioned embryonic stem cell trial at @entity243 's @entity242 , where technicians and surgeons took hours to conduct a safe injection			1
@entity40 's treatment also includes physical therapy			1
the patient and a guest receive room and board			0
the rooms are cramped with bathroom facilities available down a long hallway			0
@entity41 has treated patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or @entity258 , more commonly known as @entity260 's disease			1
others had spinal cord injuries , cerebral palsy , genetic and muscular skeletal disorders			0
pure embryonic stem cells are not meant to be put directly into the body , since they have to the potential to turn into any cell			1
that 's why credible researchers first chemically " coax " these stem cells into heading down the path of what they should turn into -- for example nerve cells or heart cells -- before injecting them into very specific parts of the body to achieve the desired results			1
the doctor offered examples of her successes including a man from @entity285 who she said was a paraplegic because of multiple gunshot wounds and an @entity6 toddler who she said has a genetic disorder similar to @entity17 's			0
@entity291 , an 18 - year - old from @entity292 who was paralyzed three years ago in a motocross accident , cites himself as another example of success at the clinic			2
" before i came here , i did n't have any movement in my left hand between my fingers , " said @entity291			0
" now i can retract them really good			0
" @entity41 conceded that when she attempted to present her findings to an internationally sanctioned stem cell conference , her medical abstract paperwork was rejected			1
but she continues to defend her work			0
" i believe that my patients are getting better , " she said			0
" i have proved it time and time and time again			0
" she was present at a recent meeting of the @entity309 where prominent @entity6 physicians criticized embryonic stem cell clinics that have appeared in @entity0 and elsewhere throughout the sprawling country			1
a leading @entity6 neurosurgeon , dr. @entity313 , agreed there was zero medical evidence of the effectiveness of embryonic stem cell therapy like that provided at @entity40			1
there is no stem cell treatment proven in @entity6 that will make patients like these better , @entity313 said , and none " proven anywhere in the world			1
" patients also have traveled for similar therapy in @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 , although that country has recently clamped down on stem cell clinics			1
for @entity181 , the money charged for the therapy stands out as an ethical issue			0
" it 's all about $ 25,000 , " he said			1
the cost of the treatment is " calculated to take a family to the brink of what they can afford , and they take everything			0
" " who does n't want to get rich ? " @entity41 asked			2
" who does n't work for money ? but you also have to work from the heart			0
you also have to see what you 're doing			0
is it ethically right ? and i believe i am doing everything right			0
" @entity1 medical managing editor @entity352 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 , 6 , had experimental embryonic stem cell therapy
doctors overwhelmingly say there 's no *possibility* it will have an effect on his condition
dr. @entity41 offers the treatment for $ 25,000 at her clinic in @entity0
@entity41 says " almost everyone -- greater than 90 % -- have had success "
