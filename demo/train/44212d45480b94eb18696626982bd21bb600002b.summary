@entity1 , @entity0 -- a foul smell permeating @entity1 and parts of @entity0 over the past two days is due to farmers on the @entity7 continent spreading manure in their fields , forecasters and @entity13 farmers said saturday			1
experts say the inescapable farmland smell permeating @entity1 will stick around for a couple of days			1
the agricultural odor is inescapable in central @entity1 and smells vaguely of farmland or even garbage			1
forecasters said a stiff breeze from the east is carrying the smell across the @entity24 from @entity25 , the @entity26 and even @entity27			1
they said the smell is likely to hang around through the weekend as the easterly wind continues			2
" you ca n't say it 's going to smell for two days , but the wind is coming in from the same direction , " said @entity29 , a forecaster with the @entity30 , @entity13 's weather service			1
" it 's not really until monday , tuesday that we 'll see a change in the wind direction , with a more marked improvement in air quality			0
" he said the smell had probably been stagnating in those countries for a few days , resulting in a more pungent aroma once the winds brought it to @entity0			1
the @entity46 blamed the smell on the muck - spreading by @entity26 farmers , who it said are banned from the practice in the winter and are now spreading it " en masse			2
" although the smell may be unusual , the phenomenon of @entity7 air spilling its contents over @entity0 is not , forecasters have said			0
" we quite often get pollution in the form of haze coming over when we 've got these winds from [ an ] easterly direction , particularly when the winds are coming off the near - continent , " he said			0
@entity29 said the smell is in much of central and eastern @entity0 , and has reached as far west as @entity64 , on the southwestern tip of @entity0 , where his office is located			2
@entity1 newspapers reported the smell on their front pages friday afternoon , with one paper branding it " @entity71			2
" the farmers ' union used the odor to make its case against a similar winter ban proposed on muck - spreading in @entity13			0

" while we are obviously very sorry for any unpleasantness caused to people living in the @entity88 , we are grateful to the @entity26 farmers for laying on such a pungent demonstration of what could happen every spring here in the @entity13 if the government presses ahead with its ill - conceived proposal to implement a blanket ban on winter slurry spreading across most or all of the country			0
