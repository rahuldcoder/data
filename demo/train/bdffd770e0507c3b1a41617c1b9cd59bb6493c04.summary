" usually i can earn $ 200 to $ 300 for a @entity25 handbag , but i will get more for a @entity12 , " @entity2 told @entity1			2

but an anti-corruption campaign launched by @entity7 president @entity100 that saw @entity7 sales of luxury goods slow significantly in 2013 has also hurt his business , said @entity76			1
