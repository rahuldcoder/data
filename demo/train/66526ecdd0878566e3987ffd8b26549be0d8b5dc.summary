-- when the @entity4 on monday sent @entity5 , an affirmative action case , back to the lower court for a second look , supporters of race - conscious policies breathed a sigh of relief			1
the @entity11 , which considers race among many other factors to achieve a " critical mass " of racial diversity in admissions , was sued by @entity17 , an unsuccessful white applicant			2
the 5th @entity19 ruled in favor of the university , and many expected the @entity4 to overturn that ruling and invalidate any use of race in college admissions			1
instead , the court remanded the case			0
the @entity17 ruling was not a simple sidestep , however			1
justice @entity32 's opinion for a surprisingly large court majority -- seven out of eight voting justices -- re-emphasized a troublesome aspect of previous rulings			2
when colleges and universities take affirmative steps to ensure that their student bodies include racial diversity that enhances the educational environment for all students , their actions are held to the same strict scrutiny as the admissions requirements that originally barred students of color from many schools in the first place			1
opinion : @entity4 does minorities a favor @entity32 wrote that the 5th @entity19 did not correctly apply the strict scrutiny standard , which requires that government policy disadvantaging a person based on race must serve a " compelling governmental interest , " and the policy must be " narrowly tailored " to achieve that interest			1
the high court ruled in 2003 that achieving diversity in higher education is a compelling interest , in part because diversity can aid the educational environment by bringing different perspectives into the classroom			2
at stake in @entity17 was whether the @entity73 admissions program was " narrowly tailored			1
" although the court suggested that it was appropriate to defer to the university 's judgment that diversity was important , @entity32 wrote that the university receives " no deference " on the question of whether its admissions standards are narrowly tailored			1
instead , he wrote , courts themselves must compare policies to determine whether " no workable race - neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity			1
" since it is racial diversity that 's at stake , this puts educational institutions in the awkward position of trying to achieve a policy indirectly , since they may only work to foster racial diversity by adopting policies that appear not to involve race at all			1
justice @entity97 , the only dissenter , argued this calls for obfuscation			0
" only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternatives as race unconscious			0
" it is the height of irony that the @entity106 should be read to require institutions committed to enlightenment to instead practice obfuscation			0
the court 's approach also puts judges in the driver 's seat for determining college admissions programs			2
this leaves the court with an outsized role in setting educational policy			0
it is troubling to see such a strong judicial footprint in educational policy when there is no reason to believe that white students in @entity73 lack political power or the ability to be heard when educational policy is made at the state and university level			0
it was different for @entity133 students , the original beneficiaries of strict scrutiny			0
they were overtly denied admission at the @entity11 until the 1950s , while @entity73 also had a long history of race discrimination in voting			0
in an earlier case , former justice @entity141 suggested there should come a day when affirmative action programs will not be necessary			1
as colleges and universities work toward this goal -- redressing disparities that linger after a long history of racial discrimination -- there must also come a day when the @entity4 stops micromanaging college admissions			2
the @entity17 ruling takes us further from this goal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			0

@entity158 : @entity4 's ruling was not a simple sidestep of affirmative action policies
she says ruling held that a lower court did not show race policy was " narrowly tailored "
she says ruling held courts should determine whether no option to race policy is available
@entity174 : universities could end up *hiding* diversity policies from courts acting as *arbiters*
