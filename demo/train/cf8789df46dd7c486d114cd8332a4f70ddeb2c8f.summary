@entity0 -- @entity3 lawmakers from more than 20 states across the country are willing to take federal funding , but only on their terms			1
some state lawmakers are pushing for sovereignty from the federal government			1
from @entity13 to @entity14 , lawmakers in mostly red states have pushed ahead with measures calling for state sovereignty under the @entity17 , saying the federal government has overstepped its bounds with the stimulus package			1
the states are calling for the right to ignore laws they deem unconstitutional			0
@entity26 state sen. @entity25 , a @entity3 and the first to introduce this type of legislation last year , originally pursued it because he thought then - president @entity30 and @entity31 exceeded their authority with the @entity33 , which required states to include certain information on driver 's licenses			1
he called the stimulus package " immoral and unconscionable " and said it was " the final straw that broke the financial back of @entity41			1
" @entity25 's bill passed the @entity43 on wednesday and the state @entity44 approved a similar measure			0
the office of lead @entity44 sponsor @entity48 rep. @entity48 said it is confident a joint resolution will get through			0
the legislation would be binding			0
so , if the governor signs it , it theoreticallly would allow @entity26 to ignore laws that are not " enumerated and granted to the federal government by the @entity57 , " as stated in the @entity17			1
" i 'm sick and tired of @entity31 overreaching and underachieving , " @entity25 said			0
he added , " if we have an opportunity to salvage freedom and protect sovereignty , it has to be done at the state level			2
" similar legislation is moving along in @entity14			0
the bill already passed in the @entity44 and a state senate panel approved it on tuesday			0
@entity3 state rep. @entity67 said he chose to sponsor the @entity14 measure because he thinks the stimulus package grants the federal government more power than the @entity57 allows			1
" the federal government is living beyond the scope that the @entity57 grants it and states should put it on notice , " @entity67 said			1
" i have n't been pleased for some time with what the federal government gets involved in , but it came to a head with the stimulus bill			2
" the @entity3 lead sponsor of the bill in @entity85 , state rep. @entity82 , said his state has used only a small portion of the money allocated in the stimulus package			1
he said local officials are the best managers of @entity85 's budget and the federal government should n't interfere with how the state chooses to spend its money			2
" i 'm not saying we do n't benefit from some of the money , but it 's important to question what are the roles and boundaries , and ask if @entity31 is exceeding them , " @entity82 said			0
" our representatives in the federal government represent the same people we do and they need to work to keep the government small and limited and efficient			2
" all the bills invoke the @entity17 , which states that " the powers not delegated to the @entity41 by the @entity57 , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people			2
" most are symbolic measures and none have passed yet , but local officials are hoping to send a message to @entity0 to back off			0
many states are criticizing the stimulus package , while others are trying to assert authority over other issues , like abortion in @entity122 and exempting firearms from federal regulations in @entity13			1
many of the bills include a provision that once the bill is passed , a copy will be sent to president @entity130 and @entity31			0
" it 's time to send a message to @entity31 that we 're sovereign , " said state rep. @entity131 , an @entity132 @entity3			2
" we have many states doing this and if you have enough sending the same message , they 're going to have to step back and take a look at what they 're doing			0
