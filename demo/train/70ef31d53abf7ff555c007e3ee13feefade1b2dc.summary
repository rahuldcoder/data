many observers point to @entity2 's close ties with @entity3 going back to the 1950s as a reason for @entity6 now acting to defend the @entity8 regime in @entity9 against its many internal and external opponents			1
what has apparently been forgotten is that @entity2 's ties with @entity9 have been plagued by tensions and disagreements throughout this entire period			0
underpinning the @entity2 - @entity3 relationship for over half a century now has been a common antipathy toward @entity18 , @entity19 , and the moderate @entity21 states			0
but they have also differed on many issues			0
when @entity25 - @entity9 relations first became close during the mid- 1950s , @entity2 seemed to hope the then - powerful @entity26 might at least share power with the virulently anti-israeli and @entity28			1
but the @entity9 @entity29 feared the communists and agreed to the 1958 merger of their country with @entity34 and even accepted the leadership of the latter 's ruler , @entity36 , partly in order to get his help in suppressing the communists			0
after @entity36 helped them do this successfully , he and the @entity9 @entity29 fell out , and @entity9 withdrew from their union ( officially the @entity46 ) in 1961			0
@entity2 restored ties with @entity3 , but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with @entity34 , which had allowed the @entity25 to build up military and naval facilities there			1
@entity25 - @entity9 relations improved after @entity36 's successor , @entity51 , switched @entity34 from being a @entity25 ally to being an @entity18 one , and even made a separate peace with @entity19			1
@entity2 was also grateful to @entity9 for being one of the few @entity57 states that did not condemn the @entity25 for invading and occupying @entity58			1
nevertheless , @entity2 and @entity3 disagreed on several issues			0
although the @entity25 supplied arms to @entity9 , @entity3 complained that @entity18 supplied better ones to @entity19 , and that this allowed @entity19 to best @entity9 on the numerous occasions when their forces clashed			2
@entity2 responded by saying there was nothing wrong with the quality of @entity25 weapons ; it was the quality of the @entity9 personnel operating them that was deficient			2
while it broke diplomatic relations with @entity19 during the june 1967 @entity72 , the @entity25 at least recognized @entity19 's right to exist			0
@entity9 , by contrast , did not			0
as a result , @entity9 did not cooperate even with @entity25 - sponsored @entity21 - @entity19 peace initiatives			2
in addition , @entity2 was not pleased about @entity9 's intervention in @entity80 's long civil war beginning in the mid- 1970 's			0
@entity2 and @entity3 often found themselves supporting different factions during it			0
further , while @entity2 ( and many @entity84 states ) supported @entity85 during the 1980 - 88 @entity86 , @entity9 -- practically alone among @entity21 states -- supported @entity88			0
@entity9 was not happy with @entity25 leader @entity89 for having improved relations with @entity18 , the @entity91 , the moderate @entity21 states , and even @entity19			1
and while @entity6 relations with @entity18 and the @entity91 deteriorated during the @entity95 era ( 1991 - 99 ) , this was also a period in which @entity6 was largely absent from the @entity97 and thus did not provide much support for @entity9			1
after @entity99 rose to power at the very end of 1999 , it soon became clear that he wanted to reassert @entity6 's influence in the @entity97 and elsewhere			1
even so , @entity6 - @entity9 relations did not improve for several years and were actually quite testy until 2005			2
@entity99 was unhappy that @entity9 was unwilling to repay its @entity25 era debt -- some $ 12 - 13 billion -- to @entity2			2
@entity3 was unhappy about the improvement in @entity6 - @entity19 relations that occurred under @entity99 , and about @entity6 's refusal to sell advanced weapons that @entity9 wanted but @entity19 objected to it acquiring			0
@entity6 - @entity9 relations , though , did improve in 2005 -- the year that @entity9 withdrew its forces from @entity80 in response to an amazing popular uprising in that country and possibly to @entity9 fear of @entity18 intervention if it did not withdraw			0
@entity2 and @entity3 resolved the debt issue ( very much in @entity9 's favor ) , @entity2 began work to revitalize the use of naval facilities at the @entity9 port of @entity121 that the @entity122 had used during the @entity124 era , and the @entity6 oil firm , @entity125 , gained a foothold in the @entity9 petroleum sector			1
while the @entity91 and the @entity128 have condemned president @entity130 's regime for its violent oppression of the popular unrest against it that arose in 2011 , @entity6 ( along with @entity134 ) has staunchly defended @entity3 in the @entity135 and elsewhere			0
many of the previous @entity6 - @entity9 differences , though , remain -- especially ones concerning @entity6 's close relations with @entity19 and the inability of @entity9 to obtain certain @entity6 weapons systems			2
should the @entity8 regime manage to crush its internal opponents and remain in power , it is doubtful that these ongoing @entity6 - @entity9 differences will disappear			1
@entity2 is not defending the @entity8 regime because it has been such a great @entity6 ally			1
what motivates the @entity148 instead is the fear that if the @entity8 regime falls , what comes next in @entity9 will be worse for @entity6 : either a @entity84 , democratic government that has no further need of @entity6 , or a radical , @entity154 regime that is as anti-russian as it is anti-western			1
in either case , @entity6 would lose influence in @entity9			2
and since @entity9 is the last country in the @entity97 in which it has strong influence , this means @entity6 will lose influence in the @entity97 as a whole			1
compared to this prospect , it is not surprising that @entity2 prefers to see the survival of the @entity8 regime despite how difficult and uncooperative a partner for @entity6 it has proven itself to be			1
