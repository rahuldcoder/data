-- your tax dollars that fund @entity4 may be going toward excessive amounts of name - brand drugs when cheaper generics could be prescribed instead , a new report suggests			1
a small portion of doctors nationwide is costing @entity11 taxpayers big time because of their tendency to prescribe name - brand medications through @entity4 even when generics are available , according to an analysis by @entity16 , a nonprofit organization producing " investigative journalism in the public interest			1
" the biggest offenders are 913 practitioners who , thanks to disproportionately prescribing name - brand drugs , cost taxpayers an extra $ 300 million in 2011 , say @entity16 's @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
each of these doctors wrote at least 5,000 prescriptions that year , according to the report			0
many of these doctors also had financial ties to the companies that manufacture the drugs they prescribed , @entity16 reports , and have accepted thousands of dollars from drug companies in the form of promotional or consulting fees			1
although @entity4 's drug program has been considered an achievement in government health care , " this seeming fiscal success has hidden billions of dollars lost to unnecessarily expensive prescribing over the program 's eight - year history , " the report said			2
the detriments of @entity48 part of the wasted money results from well - intended aspects of @entity4			2
a provision called @entity48 , which has given individuals with low incomes access to cheap medications , has at the same time enabled doctors to prescribe name - brand drugs without complaint from low - income patients , @entity16 said			1
regardless of the medication 's cost , @entity48 allows patients to pay less than $ 7 per prescription if they have low incomes			1
the lack of incentives for cheaper drugs for low - income patients is an important point raised by the report , said @entity71 , an @entity72 economics professor who was not involved in the study			1
insurance companies can use financial incentives to sway participants who are not impoverished toward generic coverage , @entity71 said , which has generally prompted a shift toward lower - cost generic coverage			0
but low - income populations are covered by the subsidy , which caps what they pay for prescriptions anyway , so there are n't financial incentives for the use of generics			1
" @entity4 needs to find a different way to monitor prescribing patterns and lower costs for this population , " @entity71 said in an e-mail			0
part d cost taxpayers $ 62 billion last year , and more than a third of that went toward this low - income subsidy , @entity16 reported			1
more than 11 million people receive the subsidy			0
the @entity16 piece pointed to an analysis from the @entity102 , or @entity102 , which reports to @entity103 on @entity4 , showing that @entity4 could save $ 1.3 billion a year in seven drug categories if generics were prescribed to low - income patients and other @entity4 enrollees in the same proportion			1
the savings might be even more , to the tune of $ 44 billion in a decade , according to the @entity112 think tank @entity111			0
@entity4 pays for one in four prescriptions in the @entity11 , @entity16 said , but it does not limit the name - brand drugs that physicians can prescribe			1
who are the doctors prescribing so many name - brand medications ? @entity16 found some patterns in ethnic neighborhoods and areas around large cities			1
for instance , a stretch of @entity124 in @entity125 has seven of the doctors with high rates of name - brand prescribing , and a building in @entity131 with six such doctors is in a @entity134 community			2
the " average cost of a @entity48 prescription in these enclaves can be more than 50 percent higher than that of surrounding areas , " @entity16 said			2
a challenge for the medical community the report 's findings about money wasted on brand - name drugs are n't too surprising , said dr. @entity146 , assistant professor of public health and medicine at @entity149 in @entity150			1
" i think that there 's a lot of marketing and misconceptions about how good is the newest , latest drug for which there 's not a generic alternative , " said @entity146 , who was not involved with the @entity16 report			1
there are few instances where brand - name drugs are superior to their generic alternative , @entity146 said			2
she could not think of a specific example			0
" @entity167 and large , if there is a generic , it should be prescribed , " she said			0
there are some efforts already in place toward addressing the problem			0
for instance , the way @entity146 's electronic health records are set up , when she enters a medication into her system , a generic gets automatically prescribed if one is available			0
she also noted that sometimes pharmacies will give patients the generic version of a drug even if the brand name has been prescribed unless the physician has specified otherwise			0
there are also drugs that have no generic equivalent , @entity146 noted			0
but for those that do have generic alternatives , marketing efforts are generally stronger for the brand - name versions			0
" many of us who practice medicine and know about the issues of rising health care costs , know that we spend a lot on brand - name medications when we do n't necessarily need to , " she said			0
" this is an interesting study because it quantifies it with a very small group of doctors			0
" variations in prescriptions for brand - name drugs have been on the radar of many insurance companies and health care researchers , @entity146 said			2
they should look at the issues presented in the @entity16 report to help control rising health care costs , she said			1
why some doctors continue prescribing brand - name versions of drugs that have generic equivalents is an important question , she said			2
" that 's a question that the medical community has to come to terms with , " she said			0
" are we not being good stewards of the resources that are available by prescribing things that could have cheaper , as effective alternatives ? "			0
