@entity0 -- enjoy hypocrisy ? this past weekend you could glut the appetite			0
on monday , @entity6 ships stopped a flotilla carrying materials that could be used for war , including cement that @entity6 maintained could be used to build bunkers , to @entity13 - ruled @entity12			1
the crew of one boat resisted violently , triggering a firefight in which nine people were killed , most of them @entity19 nationals			2
but , question : @entity19 is a @entity22 ally , an applicant to the @entity24			0
what is it doing allowing its nationals to smuggle cement that could build bunkers ? especially when those nationals belong to a group , the @entity19 @entity32 ( @entity32 ) that @entity6 has designated a terrorist organization ? the flotilla departed from @entity19 - occupied northern @entity35			1
@entity19 's occupation of half of @entity35 is deemed illegal by the @entity24 and the @entity38			1
if the government of @entity19 feels so strongly about ending disputed occupations , why does it not start with the disputed occupation it is operating itself ? the flotilla followed a breathtaking friday at the @entity38			1
the 189 signatories of the @entity46 agreed on a final list of resolutions for a safer world			0
the nuclear threat from @entity51 ? unmentioned			2
instead , the @entity46 resolution targeted -- what a surprise -- @entity6			2
shamefully , the friday resolution was joined by the @entity56			0
yes , the @entity58 administration issued a statement at the same time that " deplores the decision to single out @entity6 " and also " the failure of the resolution to mention @entity51			1
" the administration deplored -- but it signed			0
the @entity58 administration 's signature marks an abrupt departure from previous @entity56 policy			0
since the 1960s , the @entity56 has accepted @entity6 's nuclear arsenal on condition that @entity6 not threaten its neighbors			2
@entity6 has more than met that condition			0
in 1973 , @entity72 outright invaded @entity6 , in full confidence that @entity6 would not go nuclear so long as @entity72 stopped short of attacking @entity6 's cities			2
it 's important to understand that @entity6 ( like @entity76 and @entity77 ) has never signed the @entity46			2
so @entity6 's nuclear force violates no commitments or pledges : unlike , say , the nuclear programs of @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity51 , to name just four of the @entity86 countries that have been caught violating the @entity46			1
@entity51 by contrast is violating the npt			0
@entity51 is the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism			2
and @entity51 leaders have threatened to use the nuclear weapons they are seeking to annihilate @entity6			1
on monday , the @entity92 reported that @entity51 has accumulated enough nuclear material for two bombs , when fully enriched			0
and the latest round of @entity38 sanctions will do nothing to stop that bomb , because they omit the most crucial measures : a ban on exports of gasoline to @entity51 ( @entity51 now imports half its gasoline ) measures to sever @entity51 's central bank from the global payments system the measures adopted by the @entity109 last week are not only toothless , but they even contain a loophole legalizing the sale of @entity113 air defenses to @entity51 , the better to protect nuclear facilities from action by the @entity56 or @entity6			1
ok , so maybe it is not news that the @entity38 system is hypocritical and useless			0
what is news is this : the @entity58 administration has broken with 40 years of precedent and has affixed its signature to a document suggesting that it is @entity6 's weapons -- not @entity51 's -- that ought to be priority no. 1 in the @entity86			1
and now , post-flotilla , the @entity58 administration stands in danger of being drawn into the attempt to open @entity13 - ruled @entity12 to military - capable imports , and to force @entity6 to engage in some kind of negotiation with @entity13			1
former ambassador to @entity6 @entity134 , who is close to @entity58 administration thinking , outlined in the @entity136 monday the contours of just such a deal : " the administration needs to work on a package deal in which @entity13 commits to preventing attacks from , and all smuggling into , @entity12			1
in return , @entity6 would drop the blockade and allow trade in and out			0
" it 's a pretty thought			0
@entity147 groups did not go to the trouble of organizing a flotilla of supplies that could be used for war in order to end smuggling of war material into @entity12			1
nor are @entity155 groups seeking to ship the material into @entity12 in order to thwart future attacks on @entity6			1
rebuilding @entity13 ' bunkers is not a step toward peace			0
but as with the @entity58 administration 's joining the @entity163 resolution at the @entity38 on friday , followed by after - the - fact explanations that @entity6 had nothing to fear , so the @entity58 administration is now being drawn into another @entity163 action , again cushioned by assurances that , " this is for your own good			1
" monday morning , @entity171 's @entity170 reported an unnamed administration official promising " no daylight " between the @entity56 and @entity6			2
but the same administration official who promised " no daylight " also told @entity170 : " the president has always said that it will be much easier for @entity6 to make peace if it feels secure			0
" meaning : first we soothe you , then we squeeze you ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

@entity182 says @entity12 flotilla was carrying war materials
@entity19 's criticism of @entity6 ignores @entity19 's occupation of northern @entity35 , he says
new @entity38 *non-proliferation* resolution targets @entity6 but ignores @entity51 threat , @entity182 says
