-- @entity1 was determined to find pink uggs			0
@entity3 and @entity4 listened to @entity5			1
and @entity8 took a lot of @entity11 rides to @entity12			1
it 's amazing what the " @entity15 " cast remembered after 10 years			1
@entity1 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity6 and @entity8 ( who also wrote the film ) got together for @entity19 to chat about the 2004 movie and their experiences			1
( @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 did n't participate			2
) @entity8 said that the group all stayed at the same hotel in @entity12 , where the movie was shot			1
it allowed for bonding , but for the writer and actress , there were also some drawbacks			2
" the fire alarm would go off pretty much every night at some point -- it was just a flaw of the hotel , " she recalled			0
" at the time i was coming back and forth from ( ' @entity40 ' ) a lot from @entity42			0
i do n't remember if i was weird about flying or if it was the timing , but sometimes i would go do ' snl , ' then i would get in a @entity11 at two in the morning and be driven to @entity12			1
" but the members of the plastics -- the group of girls played by @entity6 , @entity4 and @entity3 -- had a good time			1
" @entity3 and i became very close very quickly , " said @entity4 , who turned 21 during filming and hosted a dinner for @entity52			1
@entity4 was obviously a good cook			2
" @entity4 taught me how to make pecan pie			1
she made my experience so magical and so safe for me , " said @entity3			0
and what of @entity1 ? she originally wanted to be the queen of mean , @entity57 , but finally gave in to director @entity58 ' insistence that she should play @entity7			0
the pink uggs were part of her @entity63 process , she laughed			0
oh , there was also the @entity65 attacking @entity26 's breast			0
the bit was done by placing a cocktail weiner in @entity26 's bra , @entity6 recalled			2
" she 's trying to do her lines and being so professional , and this dog is chomping on her fake boob			0
i 'll never forget that , " she said			0
however , though they have fond memories of the film , they 're still perplexed when people recite its very quotable lines back to them			0
what makes a movie quote so quotable ? @entity6 was recently staying in @entity84 when a fan asked her to say some of her favorites			1
" i could n't think of any of them ! " she said			0
" she literally fed me all these lines , " @entity6 said , " like : ' is butter a carb ? ' "			2
