-- for @entity5 's lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and intersex community , 2013 strengthens us with fresh resolve			1
but a new year also torments us with old anxieties			2
@entity5 is my home , but every day i must fight tooth and nail to remain			1
i inhabit a land and a paradox where my right to have a consensual relationship with an @entity16 woman is illegal -- " un-african " -- and where my daily work is a life and death matter			2
since 2009 , my community has faced the potential passage of an anti-homosexuality bill that threatens @entity24 in same - sex relationships with life imprisonment ( there are conflicting reports on whether the original death penalty provision remain )			1
this year , many @entity31 officials and other leaders have declared the legislation 's speedy passage as their @entity36 's resolutions , with the bill scheduled for discussion when @entity5 's parliament reconvenes in february			1
as a transgender man , i am not safe			2
but as a @entity5 , i am here and i remain optimistic			1
existing out in the open is ordinary for most people , but visibility is magical for those of us who once roamed the land like ghosts			2
" there are no homosexuals in @entity5 , " our leaders said not too long ago			1
they can not say that now			2
they say i am evil			0
they say my love is illegal			0
but in 2013 , they can no longer say i am not here			0
i am fighting to end discrimination as the @entity5 government cracks down on all human rights activity			1
to speak out about injustice is deemed rebellion against democracy , and to advocate for @entity63 rights is to be out of your mind			1
the @entity67 and @entity63 empowerment workshops i facilitate get shut down by minister of ethics and @entity70 fr. @entity69 even though @entity72 infections and inequality have not gone away			1
the increased fervor to pass the anti-gay bill has re-opened the wounds of past tragedies and threatens to create new ones			2
the fear is still fresh on the second anniversary of the murder of @entity82 , my colleague , whose gruesome death changed me and @entity5 's @entity63 community forever			1
seated in the same office at the gay rights organization , @entity86 , known as @entity86 , @entity82 and i had committed to ending discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity			2
we refused to stay invisible , to remain dehumanized as ghosts			0
as a result , we found ourselves on a @entity5 newspaper 's list of 100 homosexuals			1
the story 's banner : " @entity100			0
" @entity82 was subsequently killed			0
but he was not silenced : i still hear his voice telling us not to hide , or else " they will keep saying we are not here			0
" i am here , still , in 2013 , but i dread things as simple as shopping at a kiosk for groceries , because the owner has told me he does n't sell to " such people			2
" if i insist , he said , he will " teach me how to be normal			0
" a full night 's sleep is thwarted by the fear of a stranger who has followed me home or the neighbors who have formed a mob			0
my personal struggle is a small reflection of the entire @entity63 community 's everyday apprehension			1
with action on @entity5 's anti-homosexuality bill looming , the lives of the nation 's @entity63 are threatened			1
these are not nameless faces , but real people like my girlfriend , who trembles at the prospect of coming out			0
people like one trans woman who in september was brutally beaten in public by friends who discovered her identity , and another who was dragged to the police in full glare of the public			0
even heterosexual @entity24 -- including family and friends who fail to disclose @entity63 loved ones to authorities -- would face criminal charges if this bill were to pass			1
but i can report some good news			0
before @entity82 's murder , he was alive to see us win a lawsuit against the newspaper that called for our hanging			0
indeed , the @entity5 courts ' impartiality in our cases helps me stay optimistic			1
and i hope to win a @entity157 lawsuit against @entity157 evangelist @entity158 for the anti-gay terror he exported to my country			0
the past five years have also brought progress outside the courtroom			0
just a decade ago , i could n't have imagined discussing the rights of @entity63 people with motorbike taxi drivers and members of parliament alike			1
while i 've lived through the homophobia - fueled murders and suicides of friends , i also photographed my country 's first pride march last august , where we proudly waved both the @entity5 and rainbow flags @entity176			1
in drag and plain view , @entity24 celebrated life in the face of legislation that calls for our death			1
" as long as you refuse to be a victim , and you seek to empower yourself and others , whatever 's going on will get better , " president @entity184 has said			0
i believe him , and beyond that , i believe in myself			0
those who wish me harm may control the laws , but they will never steer my destiny			1
despite the injustice that follows @entity24 into a new year , our desire for freedom has taken deep root			1
the roots will one day prove deeper than their hatred , deeper than our closets			0
that 's what keeps me optimistic			0
and that 's why they can not say i am not here			0
@entity5 is my home and i intend to continue living here as i am			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity209 : new year fills @entity63 community in @entity5 with resolve -- and anxiety
he says threat of anti-homosexuality bill passage endangers @entity63 @entity24
he says by his vocal presence , he aims to end discrimination
@entity209 : @entity63 @entity24 have made advances ; *oppressors* ca n't steer my destiny
