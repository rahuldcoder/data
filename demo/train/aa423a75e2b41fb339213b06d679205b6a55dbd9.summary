-- witnesses began describing the final moments of and futile attempts to save a @entity5 mother and her two daughters inside their burning home , opening the trial monday for one of the men who authorities claim is responsible for their murders			1
prosecutors declined to give an opening statement to start the trial of @entity16 , 31 , who faces 17 charges in a brutal home invasion in @entity20			1
but they did introduce tapes from two 911 calls , a bank teller who claimed the mother tried to withdraw $ 15,000 as ransom and a police officer who found dr. @entity16 -- the lone survivor -- fighting for life outside his family 's burning home			1
the first defendant to stand trial in the case , @entity16 , was sentenced to the death penalty in december after being convicted on 16 of 17 charges filed against him			1
prosecutors allege that @entity16 and @entity37 went into the @entity39 home , beat and tied up dr. @entity16 , raped and strangled his wife , molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee			1
the two daughters , who were both tied to their beds , died of smoke inhalation			0
entering the @entity49 court monday , @entity39 succinctly told reporters , " i just hope justice was served			0
" he was one of several of the victims ' family members packing the courtroom , many of them wearing pins that judge @entity57 allowed over defense lawyers ' objections they might sway the jury			2
while he did n't present a comprehensive statement , @entity49 state 's attorney @entity61 briefly spoke to jurors , explaining that prosecutors believe the jury will be able to listen to the evidence and render a decision			1
under the law , @entity61 said , @entity37 is charged both as a principal and an accessory			1
@entity37 's defense attorney , @entity72 , told jurors that his client never intended to kill anyone , that his sole purpose in breaking into the @entity39 home was to steal			1
@entity72 said @entity37 did not have a weapon			1
he told jurors that in order to convict @entity37 of capital murder , they must determine he intended to kill someone			1
it was @entity16 , @entity72 said , who raped and strangled @entity16 , poured the gasoline and lit the match			1
@entity37 was a willing participant in the break - in and theft , but not the murders , according to @entity72 , who recounted mounting dissension between @entity16 and @entity37 as the home invasion progressed through that morning			1
@entity16 felt the @entity94 needed to be killed , @entity72 claimed , but @entity37 refused to kill anyone			1
@entity72 did allude to a " confession " that @entity37 had later made in the incident			1
while it was not yet entered into testimony on this trial 's first day , during @entity16 ' trial , a court clerk read from writings of @entity37 , in which he described the incident in a 40 - page letter that he wrote to author @entity106 in 2008			1
" all were compliant , " he wrote			0
" this time i took a risk , pulled the trigger , and the chamber was loaded			0
... the @entity39 family passed through their fears and into terror			0
" ... it was captivating , validating that this pain in me was real			0
... i was looking right at my personal demon , reflected back in their eyes			0
... @entity120 is a fighter ; she tried time and time again to free herself			0
... mr. @entity39 is a coward ; he ran away when he thought his life was threatened , and ran away to leave his wife and children to madmen			2
... i was cheated of my retribution , and so was @entity127			0
... i am what i am ; i make no excuses			0
... i 'm a criminal with a criminal mind			0
" the reading continued , " @entity133 , @entity120 , and @entity134 , forgive me ; i am damned			0
... i ca n't believe i lost control ; i hate myself / i love myself			2
" after the defense lawyers presented their opening arguments , the prosecution began to present evidence and call witnesses -- the same five people thus far , in the same order , as they did during @entity16 ' trial			1
if they continue this trend , dr. @entity39 would be the next witness to testify when the trial resumes tuesday morning			2
the first person on the stand monday was @entity148 , a registered nurse at @entity39 's medical practice who said that @entity151 had called in to say her husband was sick -- only the second time , in her recollection , that he 'd ever done so			2
then @entity155 testified how @entity151 came to her bank window to withdraw $ 15,000			2
@entity157 showed the transaction , which spurred a 911 call from the @entity162 branch 's manager , @entity163 , warning that that the family might be in trouble			0
@entity163 described @entity151 as " terrified			2
" about an hour after the visit , authorities say , she was dead			0
another 911 call came from the @entity94 ' next - door neighbor @entity169 , who testified spotting dr. petit " all banged up " and asking him to call police			0
and lastly on monday , @entity172 @entity171 explained how he 'd arrived to find @entity39 bloodied on his neighbor 's driveway			0
by the time he tried , unsuccessfully , to enter the door of the home , @entity16 and @entity37 had left and " everything was burning , " @entity171 said			1
authorities threw rocks at windows and doused flames with a nearby hose			0
but once they finally got in , " we saw no signs of life , " he said			2
in @entity187 's @entity186 and @entity0 's @entity188 contributed to this report .			0
