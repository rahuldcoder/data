-- the family of a @entity3 teenager who committed suicide after she was allegedly gang - raped and bullied says it opposes any kind of " vigilante justice " to avenge the attack			1
this comes after the activist group @entity9 said it might release the names of teens it says raped the girl in an effort to force authorities to pursue prosecution			1
an earlier police investigation ended without criminal charges			1
@entity20 , a 17 - year - old high school student from @entity21 , @entity22 , was taken off life support sunday , three days after she tried to hang herself			0
" @entity26 act fast , " @entity9 warned @entity3 law enforcement in a statement			1
" take immediate legal action against the individuals in questions			1
" " the names of the rapists will be kept until it is apparent you have no intention of providing justice , " the group said			1
@entity37 , partner of @entity20 's mother , @entity38 , said thursday that the family does not " support the publishing of the names " in the case -- which has shocked @entity3			1
" we are not looking for some kind of vigilante justice			2
" her family told @entity0 they met with @entity3 justice officials wednesday and urged them to reconsider filing charges			2
the officials assured them they would take a fresh look after a police investigation ended without criminal charges			2
how to help young rape victims a girl in torment @entity20 was bullied for more than a year after the alleged sexual assault , which happened in november 2011 when she was 15 , her family said			0
authorities confirmed that a photograph allegedly showing @entity20 having sex with one of the boys was circulated to friends ' mobile phones and computers			0
as a result , her family said , she developed suicidal thoughts			0
she also struggled emotionally after the police investigation , her mother wrote on her @entity74 tribute page			1
" @entity20 is gone today because of the four boys that thought that raping a 15 - year - old girl was ok and to distribute a photo to ruin her spirit and reputation would be fun , " her mother wrote			2
" all the bullying and messaging and harassment that never let up are also to blame			0
lastly , the justice system failed her			1
those are the people that took the life of my beautiful girl			0
" disseminating such a picture -- even if the sexual encounter was consensual -- is considered child pornography under @entity3 law			0
however , a joint investigation by @entity96 and local authorities found " insufficient evidence to proceed with charges , " @entity96 spokesman cpl. @entity95 said			0
" there are factors in determining other than the picture itself ; ages , who sent the material , computers , so it 's complex , " he said			1
" we do understand people want the answers , and the big question here is why was it done or why were n't there charges , and we understand that			0
we 're not trying to deflect blame or not be accountable			0
" healing process after rape never ends @entity9 slams law enforcement the @entity21 case is similar to the recent case in @entity124 , @entity125 , in which two boys were convicted of rape			1
in that case , lurid text messages , cell phone pictures and videos , and social media posts surrounding the sexual abuse of a girl emerged at the @entity125 trial			1
it attracted the attention of bloggers and @entity9 , a loosely organized hacking activist group			1
as far as the @entity3 incident goes , @entity9 told @entity22 justice minister @entity139 that " justice is in your hands and supports the legal machinery to move forward with charges			1
" we do not approve of vigilante justice as the media claims			2
that would mean we approve of violent actions against these rapists at the hands of an unruly mob			2
what we want is justice			2
and that 's your job			2
so do it , " the group said			0
the group said it took only a few hours to identify the boys who assaulted @entity20			0
" this was n't some high - tech operation that involved extracting private messages from someone 's @entity74 account			0
dozens of e-mails were sent to us by kids and adults alike , most of whom had personal relationships with the rapists			0
many recalled confessions made by these boys blatantly in public where they detailed the rape of an inebriated 15 - year - old girl , " the group said			0
the group said that declarations from police and prosecutors that there was n't enough evidence for an arrest " should be viewed solely as an admission of incompetence on their part			1
" " these sad little boys had no fear whatsoever about admitting publicly their crimes and even spreading photographic evidence of it			0
why were they unafraid ? they believed no one was ever going to do anything to stop them and they were right , " the group said			0
every officer that signed off on the " no evidence " conclusion , @entity9 said , " should be guarding the entrance to a petting zoo for the remainder of their careers , " when bullying goes high - tech			1

activist group @entity9 tells police : " better act fast " to take action against teens
mother says the justice system failed her daughter
*mounties* defend their actions : " it 's complex "
