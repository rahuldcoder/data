@entity0 , @entity1 -- just stepping into the stadium you can feel the electric atmosphere			1
die - hard rugby fan or not , it is thrilling			2
tens of thousands of people who have journeyed into the desert to see history being made are in full voice			2
rugby fans get into the party spirit by dressing up - this time as smurfs			2
last week 's @entity18 in @entity0 lived up to the sport 's unpredictable reputation , with surprises and upsets at every turn			1
the 78,000 people who ignored the global credit crunch to attend were well rewarded , with @entity26 lifting the @entity27 for the first time			1
they had never reached a final in any @entity31 international rugby tournament but the young squad , who have only been together for two years , can now add their names to the list of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity39 stars who have won the world cup in the shortened version of the game			1
but @entity31 , which is bidding for inclusion in the @entity44 , is as much about the spectacle as the play			1
@entity31 has seven players per side compared to the standard 15 in traditional rugby , and is played over two halves of seven minutes apiece as opposed to 40 minutes per half in traditional matches			1
as a result a @entity31 tournament can be played in just a few days , while traditional rugby tournaments may last a month			1
the result is a fast - paced game that witnesses frequent upsets and a sport that prides itself on creating a party atmosphere			1
in @entity0 , fans dressed as @entity63 , @entity65 guards , cavemen and @entity67 -- the little orange men from " @entity69			1
" standing by the sidelines wearing my @entity72 rugby shirt and euphorically cheering on my home team when they scored their only try against @entity76 was an amazing experience			0
" @entity31 is a sport in which any country can become good at , any country can play against the big boys such as @entity37 , @entity76 , " said @entity72 player @entity78			1
" playing in a @entity18 is a dream come true			0
" the spectacular opening ceremony came to life with dancers , acrobats , balloons and , yes , camels			0
the stadium 's design -- with its wide walkway between the stands and pitch -- gave the tournament a relaxed feel , allowing people to stand on the sidelines as opposed to being kept at a distance in the stands			0
fans were so close they could almost touch the players			0
the informal atmosphere also led many families to bring along their children to enjoy the event			0
every upset at last week 's tournament was ferociously cheered			0
@entity108 shocked @entity109 -- regularly winners on the @entity111 -- in the quarterfinals as the vocal crowd pushed them to hold on			0
their own fans danced in t - shirts with the image of @entity118 president @entity117			0
the event was broadcast to a record 200 hundred countries , with women 's teams included in the world cup for the first time			1
the women 's final featured a showdown between traditional rugby nations @entity37 and @entity129			0
@entity130 was needed for @entity129 to claim victory			0
it is the sport 's reputation for fun , entertainment and growing reach which supporters point to as they aspire for @entity139 recognition			2
@entity31 is competing against baseball , softball , golf , karate , squash and roller - sports for one of two new spots at the 2016 games , and @entity18 chairman @entity149 believes it has an edge			1
" having the likes of @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 competing with @entity37 , @entity76 , @entity158 and @entity159 in a @entity161 tournament is a very exciting development for the game , " @entity149 said , according to a report to the @entity152 ( @entity18 )			0
@entity164 , coach of the @entity156 women 's side which won the bowl ( a secondary prize in the women 's competition ) , said their victory was a breakthrough for them and the sport			2
" it is very important because rugby is not as popular as other sports such as table tennis and @entity139 sports , " @entity164 said on the @entity18 's web site .			2

@entity31 is bidding to be included in the @entity44
the recent world cup in @entity0 proved just how popular the sport is becoming
