@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 greets visitors with a crisp salute and a few pieces of candy			1
the 80 - year - old man stands at the gates of @entity10 in @entity1 where he has lived in retirement for years , dressed in an olive green army uniform and soldier 's cap , carrying a long wooden stick that he taps against the pavement as he walks			1
" thank you , " he cheerfully repeats to hospital guests -- in @entity18			1
@entity3 is a @entity1 veteran who fought and bled for @entity18 in the @entity20			1
sixty years ago , @entity22 and @entity1 - led armies battled each other to a bloody standstill in a conflict between @entity26 that left millions dead			1
in 1953 , both sides signed a truce that has left the @entity29 dangerously divided to this day			0
last march , during an orchestrated campaign of international saber - rattling , the communist regime in @entity18 declared that armistice agreement invalid			1
more : why the @entity20 still matters in 1951 , @entity3 was only 18 years old when he volunteered to join the @entity34			1
that same year , @entity3 was deployed to help defend @entity18 communists from @entity37 - backed troops on the @entity29 , shortly after @entity1 emerged from its own deadly civil war			1
" the people of @entity18 were suffering , " @entity3 says			1
" we were watching the @entity18 people and we had all gone through war			1
you look at @entity1 , the revolution , the struggle against the @entity45 , many people had died , " @entity3 continues , recalling preceding years of turmoil in @entity1			1
" seeing the people of @entity18 farming the land and being killed by enemy planes ... what were they to do if they could not farm ? the planes would just come and bomb them to death			1
we had to help protect the people of @entity18			2
" today , @entity3 leads visitors down a dark corridor , past framed black - and - white photos of @entity1 army heroes , to a tidy room in the hospital he calls home			2
aside from a nephew , @entity3 saiys he had no living relatives			0
his neighbors are also elderly veterans dressed in military fatigues			2
they chat outside the hospital ward , seated on park benches			0
the uniforms are a source of pride for the retired military residents , but also apparently a hospital safety measure in case one of them wanders too far outside the grounds and into the city			0
" they 're worried that the veterans that came from the countryside will get lost , so when they come here they make them wear uniforms to keep them safe , " @entity3 says			0
much of what @entity3 recalls from the @entity20 years seems to revolve around digging trenches , which he says provided essential protection from @entity22 warplanes			2
" digging trenches is not easy ... it 's not soil , it 's rock , " he says , adding that they used their bayonets to break up the rocks			2
though @entity1 military units were accompanied by @entity18 translators , @entity3 says @entity1 and @entity18 soldiers were not allowed to fraternize			1
however , another @entity94 veteran says he did have face - to - face encounters with @entity22 soldiers			0
former infantry soldier @entity97 says his mission was to guard @entity22 prisoners of war held far back from the front lines			0
" handling the captives was very dangerous , " you says			0
" they might kick you so i had to tell them to stay on their knees			0
" more : @entity18 photos and maps @entity3 says he remained in @entity18 until 1953 , when he was severely wounded in battle			2
during his two year deployment , one of @entity3 's missions was to charge up a mountain carrying explosives towards well entrenched @entity37 - backed troops			2
" they 're shooting guns at you , " he says , holding his walking stick up to his shoulder like a rifle and making shooting noises			0
" we had to bring up the explosives and bomb them , using explosives and flaming oil			0
" @entity3 was wounded at least twice			0
he rolls back a sleeve to show scars from severe burns resulting from what he said was an airstrike			0
and in the privacy of the medical ward , he insists on dropping his pants and lifting his shirt to show deep scars in his abdomen left by bullets that struck him during a battle on a mountain			0
@entity3 says he was shipped home after this injury , which left him maimed and unable to reproduce			0
the sight of the elderly war veterans in their baggy uniforms contrasts sharply with the vision of modern @entity1 that has grown up around them			1
the years of starvation and conflict seem like distant history , in a country that is now the world 's second largest economy , as well as home to billionaires , gleaming sky - scrapers , luxury shopping malls and brand new airports			2
the veterans at the @entity10 say @entity1 's newest generation know little of the hardships they suffered in @entity18			1
" young people ? of course they do n't know , " says you , the former infantry soldier who once escorted imprisoned @entity22 gis			0
" these wars took place decades ago			0
all the young people have no idea			0
" asked whether @entity18 understood the sacrifice @entity1 troops had made , the veteran shakes his head " no. " " what do the @entity18 know ? " you asks himself out loud			1
" they know what the @entity18 ( government ) tells the @entity18 people			2
" this modern - day ambivalence towards @entity18 is echoed by some @entity1 intellectuals			1
recently , @entity182 openly challenged the @entity1 government 's alliance with @entity18 in writing			1
partly as a result , he lost his job as deputy editor of the @entity188 , a journal published by the @entity190			0
" the current laissez - faire attitude the @entity22 and @entity1 have towards @entity18 is comparable to that of ( former @entity195 prime minister @entity194 towards @entity196 before @entity197 , " @entity182 said , in a recent interview with @entity2			1
if @entity199 continues threatening its @entity201 neighbors , @entity182 argued , @entity198 should take steps to reign in the regime , like freezing @entity18 accounts in @entity1 banks			1
" the unpredictability of @entity18 's policies prove its nature is dangerous , " @entity182 said			1
veterans who risked their lives for @entity18 more than half a century ago have little to say about the current government in @entity199			2
but they do not seem to hold a grudge against their former @entity22 enemies			0
when asked by an @entity22 reporter whether he had any message for the @entity22 , @entity3 responds by saying , " the @entity22 are peaceful people			0
" next to him , several of his fellow veterans nod in agreement			0
" i think the @entity22 did not want to go to war ( in @entity18 )			2
" asked whether he feared war might once again break out on the @entity29 , @entity3 expresses confidence that the @entity1 government would prevent hostilities from erupting			1
" the central government will handle it			0
it is guided by the ideas of @entity228 , " he says , referring to the founder of @entity1			2
" big countries do n't want war and we 're against war and this is what we 've been taught			0
" more : will @entity18 listen to @entity1 ? more : the @entity18 you have n't seen			1
