reigning formula one world champion @entity1 was the fastest man on the tracks during the second last day of pre-season testing at the @entity6 near @entity7 saturday			1
the @entity9 driver notched up the best lap of the day after changing from the slower medium compound to soft tires			1
yet his time of one minute , 23.022 seconds was still marginally slower than that achieved by team - mate and 2014 driver 's championship rival , @entity18 on the soft tires on friday			2
the @entity20 later told reporters he would have liked more laps having missed last week 's practice session due to illness but was content with how the car was performing			0
" it 's been generally good , " @entity1 said in quotes carried by the @entity29 news agency			1
" the team has done a great job to get all the components here and reliability has been strong			0
we are in as good a shape as we can be			0
" @entity9 were by far and away the dominant force in @entity38 last year and there was little indication saturday that this will not be the case in 2015			1
@entity42 were the closest challengers , as they had been on friday , with @entity44 finding his best time of the testing season			2
but this was still fully two tenths of a second down on @entity50 despite @entity44 being on the faster super-soft tires at the time			0
@entity54 's @entity53 clocked third fastest time of the day , marginally over one hundredth of a second behind @entity44			1
saturday proved yet another unhappy day for the @entity0 sponsored @entity59 - @entity58 team as reserve driver @entity61 's participation was cut short after his car suffered an oil leak			2
@entity61 was standing in for @entity64 who suffered concussion after crashing last sunday			0
" the day stopped a little too early for us , " said @entity59 racing director @entity66			2
" we did n't do as many laps as we wanted			0
it is true it is going to hurt the development of the car on the performance side , but we will recover			0
" the @entity38 season gets underway in @entity75 on march 15 .			1
