@entity0 -- despite being out of office for more than two decades , former president @entity2 has been a regular feature in political news this year -- receiving awards for volunteer work or jumping out of planes to celebrate his birthday -- and this week he kicks up his schedule right as his last name is again buzzing with presidential speculation			1
@entity2 will receive a prestigious award for his work as his presidential center observes the 25th anniversary of the fall of the @entity18 , a major milestone which occurred during his presidency			2
he then will appear with his son , former president @entity22 , in a public event as he unveils a biography he has written about his dad -- an occurrence which is sure to draw a lot of public attention on both of them , their relationship and the @entity2 presidencies			1
on monday the @entity33 awarded the elder @entity2 the @entity34 , which recognizes public figures who have advanced the cause of peace , the construction of @entity40 and human values			1
he is the first @entity42 to receive the honor			0
" throughout his long career in public service president @entity2 was always mindful of human rights and the need to advance the cause of peace in the world , " said former ambassador @entity47 , dean of the @entity48 at @entity49			1
that is where the presentation occurred during a conference commemorating the wall 's fall and will include key officials from @entity2 's administration -- his national security adviser @entity60 and secretary of state @entity61			1
on tuesday , @entity2 and his wife @entity62 will be on hand at a very different type of event			2
their son will unveil the biography he wrote " 41 : a portrait of my father , " which is described as a personal look his father through his own eyes			1
@entity2 41 , a prolific letter writer , never wrote an autobiography but did release copies of many notes he penned throughout his life to family , friends and colleagues giving the public a glimpse of his personal thoughts and impressions of his life and career			2
in his new book @entity22 not only discusses the professional highlights of his dad but also his influence on his own life -- growing up in @entity89 , recounting early campaign trips with him , his decision to go into politics then following in his footsteps into the @entity94 and the decision to go to war in @entity97 -- a country which dominated both @entity2 presidencies			1
now the elder @entity2 just saw a new generation of his family enter government service			2
his grandson @entity103 won statewide office in @entity89 capturing the politically powerful position of @entity106 in a landslide and is looked at as a rising star in the @entity109			0
@entity2 41 now waits to see whether his son former @entity111 gov. @entity110 will run for the @entity94 as he has urged him to do -- although other members of the family have not embraced a possible third president @entity2 as enthusiastically			1
" forty one believes strongly that @entity110 would be a superb president and very much hopes he will run			2
mrs. @entity117 also knows - and has stated several times - that @entity110 would be a superb leader in the @entity119 , but what mother wants to see their son or daughter attacked and pounded the way she saw it happen to her husband and eldest son ? as @entity129 often says , presidential politics ' ai n't bean bag , ' " @entity2 spokesman @entity127 told @entity1			1
the elder @entity2 also has kept his hand in politics this campaign year endorsing several successful @entity109 candidates , including @entity135 senator @entity134			0
in an interview with @entity137 @entity22 talks about one moment -- the 1992 speech accepting the @entity109 's presidential nomination -- when @entity2 41 did not meet his son 's expectations			1
" i was very disappointed , not in him , but in the process			0
and he gave - he did give a flat speech [ at the @entity146 ] and it frankly was n't full of many interesting ideas			0
it was kind of defensive			0
and there 's a couple of lessons there about this moment			0
one is - is that if you 're gon na give a big speech , get it written early and get used to it , " @entity2 told @entity137			0
" get comfortable with it because it enhances the delivery			0
and secondly , that if you expect to win political races , you better have strong policy platform			0
and they were playing - they were kind of playing small ball at this point , and presidents have got to have bigger agendas			0
