-- once again , the head of world soccer has put his foot in his mouth			0
@entity6 , the man who infamously said that racism on the pitch could be settled by a handshake , has been forced to apologize to @entity10 after apparently mocking the @entity12 and @entity13 star			1
when asked at a question and answer session at an @entity20 university last friday if he preferred @entity10 or his rival @entity14 , the @entity16 president at first said he could not decide			1
however , after extolling the virtues of @entity22 's " good boy " @entity14 , he stood up and gave the audience at @entity24 a bizarre impersonation of @entity10 , calling him " a commander on the field of play " and then claimed he spent " a lot more at the hairdresser 's			1
" @entity6 concluded : " i like both of them , but i prefer @entity14			1
" @entity10 , who was named tuesday with @entity14 among 23 candidates for @entity16 's 2013 @entity35 world player of the year award , posted a response on social media along with a link to footage of @entity6 's performance			1

@entity12 president @entity77 , who signed @entity10 , wrote a letter to @entity16 complaining about the player 's treatment by a man who is a " socio " ( honorary member ) of the club -- which represented @entity62 as one of the ruling body 's founder members back in 1904			1
" it that has been a huge disappointment among the @entity91 family , especially since these unfortunate and unacceptable manifestations come from the president of world football 's governing body , " @entity77 wrote			2
" on the one hand , they are unfair to a football player who has millions of fans around the world			2
this is without doubt one of the best players of all time			0
he embodies the values of sport in a society certainly in need of these kind of examples			0
" finally , we understand that your comments may influence the votes of those who have to decide on who should receive the award			0
" @entity6 wrote to @entity10 via @entity47 , saying : " i apologize if you were upset by my light - hearted answer at private event on friday			1
i never meant to offend you			0
" he also sent a reply to @entity12 , which the club published on its website			2
" in response to a question about @entity14 and @entity10 , the moderator asked me to choose between one of the two and , in this moment having commented that @entity14 is the type of son all mothers would like to have , i ended up saying his name , " @entity6 explained			1
" however , i want to make it clear that for me @entity10 is at the same level as @entity14 and that they are both exceptional players , each one in their own way			1
" it was never my intention to upset or show a lack of respect towards @entity12 , one of their players or their fans			0
" meanwhile , @entity22 moved four points clear in @entity62 with a 3 - 0 win at @entity147 on tuesday			0
@entity14 was not able to add to his eight @entity66 goals this season , leaving him joint second with @entity10 , but he helped set up @entity152 ' second goal			1

@entity58 reached the quarterfinals with a 4 - 0 win over @entity178 struggler @entity193 , as @entity196 striker @entity195 scored twice , but @entity198 's poor season continued with a 4 - 3 defeat at second division @entity200			0
