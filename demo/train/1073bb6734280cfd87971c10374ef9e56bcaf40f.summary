an x-ray shows a bullet lodged in a baby 's head			0
the image would be chilling enough without knowing the child was still in its mother 's womb when it became the target of snipers hiding in the shadows in northern @entity12			1
and it 's not the only one			0
volunteer doctor @entity17 , a @entity18 surgeon who 's worked in several @entity12 hospitals with the charity @entity20 , says snipers are playing a " targeting game , " and heavily pregnant women are on the hit list			1
" most of the children removed were seven , eight , nine months gestation , which meant it was fairly obvious to anybody that these women were pregnant			1
" young children are also being targeted , @entity17 said			1
polio cases suspected in @entity12 photos provided to @entity32 by @entity20 show a young girl with painted nails lying in a hospital bed with head wounds			1
she appears no more than five years old			0
another , around the same age , lies under a green sheet with a gaping wound to her forehead			0
@entity17 said 90 % of surgeries he performed on any given day were for sniper wounds			1
on some days , the wounds were suspiciously similar			1
" after a while we noticed that there were certain trends going on , " @entity17 said			1
" we had some days , say , 10 or 15 gunshot wounds of which eight or nine of them were targeted in one particular area			1
so for example , one day , we received say 15 , 16 gunshot wounds and of that eight to nine were targeted in the left groin only			1
" then the following day they were targeted in the right groin only			2
so it seemed to me like there was some of thing going on -- a game going on -- between the snipers			1
" @entity65 said other local doctors he worked with told him they 'd heard snipers were receiving little presents -- like packets of cigarettes -- for people they 'd shot during the day			2
@entity18 foreign secretary @entity72 : no role for @entity74 in future @entity12 desperate dash for supplies in video obtained by @entity32 from @entity81 , men , women and children try to outrun snipers ' bullets as they cross from the regime - controlled enclave of the city to rebel - held areas			1
they risk their lives because food and provisions are on the rebel side			0
but their homes and families are on the regime side			0
desperate , they make a dash for supplies			0
not everyone makes it through			0
it is a scene reminiscent of another conflict : @entity103			0
its capital , @entity106 , was literally under siege from snipers of the @entity109 for more than four years			0
but during that war in the early 1990s , the @entity111 operated humanitarian corridors to ensure that , despite the fighting , aid still got through			0
@entity17 also volunteered in @entity103 and described his relief back then at seeing extra supplies trucked in			2
" it was wonderful to see the lorries coming in with @entity120 written on them			0
and when you saw one of them , you knew that that they were filled with food , provisions and medical aid for the besieged town			2
" he says @entity12 desperately needs the same			2
" now is the time to develop a humanitarian corridor to allow health and aid workers to go in , and not feel threatened on the way in and not feel threatened on the way out , " he said			2
" i felt very scared going in and coming out and this is n't right			0
" in northern @entity12 , rebels use satire as a weapon			2
