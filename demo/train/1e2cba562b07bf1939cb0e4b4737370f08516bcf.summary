-- throw a little celebratory glitter for " @entity2			1
" despite being in its 18th season , the @entity4 reality series still managed to make monday night 's premiere feel fresh			1
part of that is thanks to @entity10 , the @entity12 personality who 's taken over co-hosting duties from @entity14 , but monday 's episode also debuted a set makeover , a new band and a new twist on voting			1
every week , celebrities pair up with their assigned professional ballroom dancers to learn a dance routine to perform for the judges			0
with a combination of votes from viewers and scores from the judges , each celebrity competing vies to be the star with the highest score weekly so he or she can advance to the next round			0
those who land in the bottom are eliminated from the show			2
but to shake up the process , " @entity40 " is now allowing viewers to vote for stars to switch pro partners midway through the season			2
the cast this year includes child stars such as @entity43 ( aka @entity44 from " @entity45 " ) and @entity46 ( @entity47 from " @entity48 " ) , plus " @entity54 of @entity55 's " @entity49 , comedian - tv host @entity50 , and champion ice dancers @entity51 and @entity53			1
@entity51 , who 's paired with @entity56 , and @entity57 , who 's dancing with @entity58 , had the top two routines of the night			1
( the " @entity48 " actress caught the judges off guard with her skills			0
) @entity50 , @entity49 and @entity43 , whose fox trot got thunderous applause , all earned scores that landed them in the middle			0
@entity69 ended up scoring below her ice - dancing partner @entity51 , earning just a 24 to @entity51 's score of 27			2
( that difference made at least one viewer wonder if the judges are playing favorites			0
) the real standout of the night was @entity78 ( as we predicted )			2
the 76 - year - old " @entity81 " actor not only pulled off a cha - cha with pro partner @entity83 to the movie 's theme music , but he did it with two stormtroopers and @entity87			0
the audience -- which included some @entity90 -- loved it , but the judges thought his routine was lacking energy and gave him the lowest score of the night , a 15			0
the first elimination in the 18th season of " @entity2 " will take place next week .			1
