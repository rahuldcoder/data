@entity0 -- if history is any guide , president @entity2 will reach for the stars during his @entity7 address tuesday night			1
but in the end , reality will bring his plans back down to @entity11			1
@entity2 's " blueprint " for 2012 may run into similar partisan roadblocks that trimmed his lofty hopes for last year			2
" there are absolutely things that remain undone that need to be done , " @entity17 spokesman @entity16 admitted to reporters on monday even as he touted a " fairly comprehensive list of proposals " that he believes the president has achieved			1
ambition is taking the fall for unfinished business			0
" if you got through a year and you achieved everything on your list then you probably did n't aim high enough , " @entity16 said			1
@entity31 : 4 things to look for in speech among the president 's unmet promises from last year 's address are pledges to increase investment in clean energy , take action on the status of illegal immigrants , fund new infrastructure projects , overhaul social security and let the @entity46 tax cuts on the highest income bracket expire			1
the president submitted proposals to @entity50 addressing some of his 2011 pledges , including on infrastructure spending and the tax cuts , but @entity54 promptly rejected those measures			1
on other issues , including entitlement reform , a simplification to the tax code , and addressing illegal immigration , no concrete plan from the @entity17 ever reached @entity50			1
but the @entity17 can point to some concrete achievements outlined in last year 's address			1
these include the passage of trade deals with @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 ; an end to the war in @entity70 ; and a repeal of the " 1099 provision " that was said to burden small businesses ' bookkeeping efforts relating to health care coverage			0
even before the president utters the first words of his carefully crafted 2012 speech , @entity54 are sending loud signals that there will be little to applaud			2
" this year , the president 's prospects for hope and change are even smaller , " @entity82 press secretary @entity81 said			1
read a pre-release transcript of the speech some of the president 's policy proposals that @entity17 aides describe as ambitious will require congressional approval , and most of those " may be dead on arrival in @entity50 , " @entity81 predicted			1
but the president 's tone is expected to be matched with a call for action			2
" he rejects the idea that nothing can get done in an election year , " @entity16 said			1
seizing on the economy as his principal theme , @entity2 gave a preview of the speech to supporters in a video released by his re-election campaign			0
in what he called a " blueprint for an @entity116 economy that 's built to last , " the president said manufacturing , energy , education and values would be the foundation for building an " economy that works for everyone , not just a wealthy few			2
" he 'll fill in the details during the speech , but a @entity127 source briefed on the current draft of the @entity7 gave @entity1 a preview of what will be proposed : a tax code that lets the @entity46 tax cuts expire and the wealthy pay more more refinancing for homeowners in trouble additional tax breaks for companies that create jobs in the @entity116 more clean energy incentives enhanced education and job training initiatives a renewed call for the so - called @entity145 rule , a minimum tax rate for the wealthiest @entity116 the creation of a @entity149 task force to monitor trade violations these proposals come after months of deliberations behind the scenes			0
the president held a conference call last week with state legislators , mayors and tribal leaders " to hear their ideas about the @entity7 , " a senior administration official told @entity1			2
through draft after draft , top aides have described the president as " very engaged " in the process			2
he worked with chief speechwriter @entity167 and others on his policy team to " refine it			0
" tweaks will continue until delivery			0
looking to draw in viewers beyond the traditional television networks , the @entity17 will host an interactive live - streamed version of the speech on its website at @entity178			1
senior administration officials are expected to take part in a post-address discussion that will include a live audience and questions from @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			0
another sales pitch will involve the president hitting the road wednesday with a three - day , five - state tour			2
he 'll tackle one of the main pillars laid out in his address each day , according to a senior administration official			0
on wednesday it will be manufacturing ; thursday , energy and energy security , and friday , @entity116 skills and innovation			0
@entity54 consider the highly touted tour a tax - funded campaign trip , with convenient visits to states that could be key to the president 's re-election efforts			0
" @entity2 's speech wo n't be as important for the policy agenda he lays out ... as for the political campaign it sets for the next nine months , " the @entity82 's @entity81 said			1
" perhaps that 's why he will travel to @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 , all potentially swing states in the election			0
" the @entity17 brushes aside that criticism and redirects attention to the president 's primary goal of fixing the economy and creating jobs			1
top aides insist that despite predictions of more gridlock , there 's no reason proposals that will be detailed in the @entity7 address ca n't find bipartisan support			0
and while some of last year 's promises went unmet , tuesday night 's address will be no less ambitious			0
" you should n't trim your sails because of that , " @entity16 said			0
@entity1 's @entity239 contributed to this report .			0
