-- nine women , a bold proposal and a $ 1 bill			1
that was what it took for women 's tennis to begin a 40 - year journey of self - empowerment that has created a generation of sporting millionaires			1
back in 1971 , the total prize money on offer for the first women 's tour was $ 309,000 spread over 19 tournaments			1
in 2012 , including the purse from the four grand slams , it cracked $ 100 million for the first time -- this year it is projected to hit $ 107 million			1
" i forecast to the athletes in my first player meeting that we would get to $ 100 million in 2014			2
to be able to reach that milestone two years ahead of that is testament to the commercial success of women 's tennis , " says @entity24 , who has been chief executive of the @entity25 since 2009			1
when @entity32 , the modern queen of the @entity25 , won the @entity33 last september her $ 2 million prize haul matched the entire career earnings of @entity35 -- one of the pioneering nine and a dedicated fighter in the cause of women 's equality			1
" i think they 're truly proud of how far women 's tennis has come from the $ 1 contract to the $ 100 million generation , " @entity24 told @entity0			1
" meeting the original nine and spending time with them this past april in @entity46 was inspirational			0
" to hear their stories and what they had to go through to stand up to the establishment and take the risk for something they believed in was amazing			0
" @entity35 was one of the players frustrated by a lack of parity with the men 's game in her era , when women struggled to find enough tournaments to play in -- let alone be paid on equal terms			2
defying the @entity65 , she set up a rebel tour with the help of publisher @entity68 , who proffered the symbolic $ 1 contracts for the players			2
it was a schism that led to the formation of the establishment - approved @entity25 in 1973 -- which will be marked this year by the @entity25 's " @entity79 " commemorative campaign , a celebration of four decades of progress in the women 's game			1
it was the start of a circuit that now covers the globe			0
this year 's schedule began with simultaneous events in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , and will climax with the season - ending championships in @entity88 in late october			2
the 2012 @entity90 showpiece attracted the event 's biggest crowds for 12 years , in a country not known for its tennis heritage , while @entity84 will host a fifth @entity25 tournament from 2014			1
" we are obviously seeing extensive growth in our @entity98 territory and in @entity84			0
we are looking at how we take the next quantum leap , " said @entity24			2
" we are making sure that at the end of the day we have a circuit structure that can consistently deliver to our top events , because that 's how we 're going to drive the business , to deliver to sponsors and broadcasters			2
" and it is becoming a very big business			0
@entity35 was the first woman to earn six figures in a season , back in 1971			0
last year world no. 1 @entity111 and @entity32 both became the first to break the $ 7 million barrier			1
in the men 's game , only @entity114 ( $ 12.8 million ) and @entity115 ( $ 8.6 million ) earned more on court			1
the brand of women 's tennis has been driven by the @entity25 's " @entity136 is beautiful " campaign , which depicts the players both as athletes and style icons -- along with celebrity endorsers such as singers @entity127 and @entity129 , actress @entity130 and businessmen @entity131 and @entity133 ( see pictures in the gallery above , courtesy the @entity25 )			1
" we 're marketing the players as the world 's strongest female athletes , " @entity24 said			1
" we do have this duality of the off - court lifestyle and entertainment part of it , premium and glamorous			0
strong confident women who have endured intense battles to be at the top of their game and be the best in the world			0
" while other women 's sports , such as golf , have struggled to maintain lucrative sponsorships , tennis is bucking the trend			1
" it is very important to stress that women , both in terms of prize money and in terms of commercial incomes in tennis and other sports , are the poor relations compared to men , " says sports business expert @entity158			1
" the women who earn significant revenue often fit a specific sociocultural stereotype			0
" @entity158 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity174 's @entity173 , cites the examples of @entity176 and @entity177 -- @entity178 who capitalized on both their good looks and playing skills to become two of the most wealthy and high - profile women 's players			1
@entity158 says that while the gap between men 's and women 's pay is closing in tennis , the sport is also becoming more global -- which increases its value for sponsors and commercial partners			1
" further , i think female tennis player brands embody a particular set of qualities , such as strength , power , beauty , success , that some brands find appealing because it enables them to target specific consumer groups , thus strengthening perceptions of their brands -- for which corporations are prepared to pay , " he told @entity0			0
" the fact that some of the recently successful players , such as @entity209 , are from growing or strong economies , has been helpful in drawing in new revenue streams to the sport from sponsors and commercial partners that previously may not have had an involvement in tennis			0
" while @entity176 and the @entity32 sisters have their own off - court business empires , the @entity25 actively helps players establish their own brands			2
" one of our competitive advantages is that we have so many compelling individual stories , " @entity24 said			2
" our team is there to help develop their brand plans			0
some of them have agents who do that , others do n't -- that 's where the campaign helps			0
what 's most important is that they be themselves			0
" the @entity25 has not always been in such a healthy situation			2
when @entity24 joined in 2006 , having made her name at @entity239 as a reviver of struggling tournaments , she faced a situation where players were complaining of burnout			1
" we needed radical change			0
the bottom line was at the top tournaments players were n't consistently showing up , and that was impacting our credibility -- media were talking about it , sponsors were questioning ' are they really going to show ? ' " she said			0
as part of its " roadmap reform , " the @entity25 cut the number of top - level events players had to enter from 26 to 20			2
it 's now 22 , and prize money is up 51 %			1
" we had grown and grown and grown , there was no shortage of people wanting to do @entity25 tournaments -- if anyone raised a hand , we said come on			1
but there 's only so many top - 10 players , " @entity24 said			2
" the intensity of their play through that period just escalated and their bodies were breaking down			0
we knew we had a commitment system that could n't work			0
" in the 1990s the women 's game was invaded by girls in their early teens , such as @entity279 and @entity177 , whose stars burned brightly but comparatively briefly			1
more recently top players such as @entity282 and @entity283 retired twice each before they were 30			0
both battled with injuries at the end of their careers			0
in view of these issues , the @entity25 's emphasis is now on prolonging the careers of marquee players such as the @entity32 sisters			2
both have been selective about their playing schedule as they have battled back from injuries and serious illnesses , though @entity32 has not opted out of the tournament commitment system -- which , under @entity25 rules , she could do as a top - 10 player over the age of 30			0
" we 've been able to take the average career length from 12 years to now 15 years			0
i 'd rather have 15 years of a superstar than a couple of great years then injured , " @entity24 said			0
" both @entity32 and @entity306 are a gift to women 's tennis			1
@entity306 is thinking long term and i know @entity32 is , along with others			0
" the @entity25 's pressing business goal is to find a replacement for main sponsor @entity314 , which concluded an eight - year partnership at the end of 2012			1
" we 'll get through that			0
i 'd like to have it for 2013 but usually a sales cycle for a global multimillion - dollar sponsorship is 18 - 24 months , and we are 10 months into this , " @entity24 said			2
and if there is ever any hint of complacency about continuing the @entity25 's success , @entity24 will remind the players of the words of that pioneering nine			1
" they 're proud of women 's tennis and proud of our success			1
a couple of them looked at me poignantly and said ' do n't let them catch us			0
' we did n't work this hard for women 's tennis not to be no. 1			1
