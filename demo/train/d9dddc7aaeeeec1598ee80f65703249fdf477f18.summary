join them at the following times : june 5 : 0900 ( @entity13 ) , 1400 ( @entity14 )			0
@entity15 ( @entity7 ) -- when @entity0 took to the @entity17 to mark her diamond jubilee alongside tens of thousands of well - wishers , it was n't the first time the royals have made merry by messing about on the river			1
for centuries , @entity1 's monarchs have celebrated their biggest occasions on the water , creating scenes that have inspired generations of artists , musicians and writers			1
constitutional historian @entity32 says the @entity17 has long been " @entity1 's royal river and @entity15 's ' grandest street , ' " playing host to a string of colorful regal festivities			1
" the grandest royal river pageants have always been used to celebrate the coronation and inauguration , " said @entity32 , guest curator of the " @entity41 " exhibition at the @entity39 in @entity40			1
@entity48 's famed " water music " and his " @entity49 " were both written for regal @entity46 festivities in the 18th century			0
and diarists @entity50 and @entity52 wrote of the spectacle they witnessed when @entity54 took part in a pageant in 1660 , a year after the restoration of the monarchy			0
@entity50 described the scene as the king and queen journeyed downriver from @entity62 to @entity63 " under a canopy with 10,000 barges and boats , i think , for we could see no water for them			2
" for @entity71 , the event was " the most magnificent triumph that ever floated on the @entity17			2
" he wrote admiringly of " the innumerable boates and vessells dress 'd and adorn 'd with all imaginable pomp ... the thrones , arches ... stately barges ... musiq and peals of ordnance both from ye vessels and the shore			0
" now things have come full circle : the @entity2 pageant was partially inspired by the work " the @entity17 on @entity91 " by 18th - century artist @entity90			1
@entity92 artist @entity90 ( 1697 - 1768 ) -- better known as @entity90 -- painted the piece ( seen above ) while living in @entity15 in the 1740s and 1750s			2
@entity90 was most famous for his depictions of the lavish celebrations along the canals of his native @entity98 , and found a similarly festive subject during his stay in @entity1			1
today , the painting is part of the @entity103 in @entity104			0
currently on loan to the " @entity41 " exhibition to mark the jubilee , it has an intriguing history			0
in the gallery 's audio guide , chief curator @entity110 explains how the work was purchased from the artist by @entity115 , the sixth @entity116 of @entity117 , while he was in @entity15 buying horses -- and carrying on a scandalous affair with the wife of the @entity98 ambassador			0
it was displayed in the family 's homes for generations , until it was stolen by the @entity126 during @entity127 for years in an @entity129 salt mine , it was finally returned to @entity104 at the end of the war , only to be confiscated again by the @entity132 in 1948			0
following the fall of the @entity136 in 1989 , the @entity116 family , who had long since fled to the @entity134 , set about reclaiming the collection			0
@entity110 says the painting shows a time when " the @entity17 was the main highway , the lifeblood of the city , filled with craft of every size , making their way up and down and across the river			2
" and it is exactly this that the organizers of the 2012 event hoped to emulate , with " a piece of theater on the water " -- complete with music , fireworks and special effects -- not to mention 20,000 people on a 7 - mile - long flotilla made up of 1,000 boats			1
" what more appropriate way of celebrating the @entity2 of the queen , who will herself , at the climax of the celebrations , lead another grand royal river pageant ? " @entity32 asked .			1

seven - mile - long flotilla of 1,000 boats traveled along @entity17 to mark queen 's jubilee
event followed the *pattern* of " theatrical " pageants of past centuries
@entity90 painting *provided* inspiration for the celebration along " @entity1 's royal river "
