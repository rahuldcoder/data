-- if they 're going to pull out a victory in the midterm elections , @entity1 need to win over women			1
but they 're doing everything in their power to alienate them , from pushing extreme anti-abortion measures that even most @entity1 voters oppose to blocking equal - pay legislation to , well , just opening their mouths			2
a leading @entity1 congressional candidate in @entity12 recently said , sure , a woman can run for office if she is " within the authority of her husband			0
" a report actually commissioned by @entity1 groups and reported in @entity20 found that women view the party as " intolerant " and " stuck in the past			2
" the report found that women are " barely receptive " to @entity1 policies			2
in other words , @entity1 are losing female voters faster than their anti-contraception policies can produce them			1
what are @entity1 to do ? the @entity1 seems reluctant to change its actual policies to support women 's economic and reproductive choices and , ya know , generally acknowledge the realities of modern liberated women			1
so instead , several @entity1 candidates are coming out against domestic violence in an attempt to seem sensitive to us girls and our issues			1
that should do the trick , right ? " my ex-husband beat me with a baseball bat , threw me in a garbage can filled with snow and left me in a frozen storage locker to die , " a woman says , looking straight at the camera , in one such ad for @entity48 , the @entity1 governor of @entity49			0
" at that time , i was pregnant , and i lost the child i was carrying			0
but i fought to stay alive for my other two children , and today i am fighting for @entity48			0
" similar ads have been run by @entity58 , @entity1 @entity60 candidate in @entity61 , and @entity62 , @entity1 @entity60 candidate in @entity63			0
there 's just one problem : all the rhetoric in the world does n't make up for republicans opposing and obstructing pro-women policies			0
it 's not just the repeated attempts to crush reproductive freedom and block equal - pay legislation ; republicans also opposed the reauthorization of the @entity76			2
that 's the law that was actually supposed to do something about domestic violence , a law that @entity1 blocked for over a year before finally caving and allowing it to pass			1
republicans objected to provisions in the bill that would expand domestic violence protections for @entity86 and gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender @entity89 ; they even tried to pass their own version of the bill with these protections stripped out			1
ultimately , after a year of obstructionism , @entity1 allowed the more expansive and bipartisan @entity60 version of the act to come up for a vote in the @entity98 -- and even then , a majority of @entity1 voted against the measure			2
fast - forward to election season			0
@entity104 @entity1 @entity103 has one of the toughest re-election fights in the country			0
in the @entity98 , @entity103 voted against the expanded version of the @entity76 , the version that ultimately passed , but voted for the narrow @entity1 version that did n't pass			1
now , @entity103 is running an ad featuring a survivor of domestic violence who says , " our congressman , @entity115 , is advocating for things like ( the ) @entity76			1
" well , kinda sorta but not really , @entity115			0
@entity103 's opponent , @entity118 , had her response ad up within 24 hours , accusing @entity103 of " saying one thing in tv ads , doing the opposite in @entity123			0
" which basically sums up all the attempts of @entity1 to appeal to female voters on rhetoric but abandon them on policy			1
and to be clear , equal pay and reproductive freedom are also key to preventing domestic violence			1
as the @entity136 writes , " like all women , survivors of domestic violence need equal pay initiatives like the @entity135			1
as long as women are paid less than men , most survivors will have less ability to gain financial stability and independence			0
" many of these women are low - wage workers , who would also be helped by raising the minimum wage			0
and a new study this week finds ( @entity150 ) that as many as one in four women who seek an abortion experience violence from an intimate partner			0
women often say one primary reason for seeking an abortion is to avoid exposing their children to domestic violence			2
another reason : they do n't want to remain tied to an abusive partner			0
according to this long - term study , when these women are able to access abortion services , their odds of being abused decrease by 7 % each month after -- while women who ca n't get an abortion see their rates of domestic violence remain the same or even increase			2
reproductive choice , including abortion rights , and wage equity , including raising the minimum wage and passing gender - equity legislation , are key not only for all women and their families but for victims and survivors of domestic violence , for whom economic and reproductive freedom translates directly into freedom from abuse			1
the @entity1 has do more than just talk about domestic violence and women 's opportunity and actually support the real policies that support women 's freedom and choices -- or otherwise , women will keep choosing to vote for @entity194 .			1

@entity196 : @entity1 needs to win female voters , but its policies are just alienating them
@entity196 : to look as if they care , @entity1 candidates are coming out against domestic violence
@entity1 blocked @entity76 for year before allowing it to pass , she says
she says @entity1 fights true women 's issues of reproductive choice , wage and gender equity
