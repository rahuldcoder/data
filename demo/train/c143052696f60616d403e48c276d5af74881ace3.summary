@entity0 -- recordings until recently locked inside a college library in the @entity4 might help solve a decades - old murder mystery , but the release of those tapes threatens to damage the fragile peace in @entity9			1
the investigation into the december 1972 abduction and killing of widow @entity13 in @entity14 was revived by authorities after the release of interviews made by @entity18 as part of the @entity20			1
the interviews conducted with former @entity9 paramilitary fighters provide an oral history of the decades of fighting			1
participants in the project were told their recorded interviews would be kept secret until their deaths			0
last year a @entity4 court ruled that tapes of deceased interviewees that contained claims about the killing be given by @entity18 to police in @entity9			1
one of those featured in the tapes was @entity37 , a now - deceased former commander of the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , a @entity40 paramilitary group , who accused @entity43 leader @entity42 of involvement , an allegation he denies			1
on wednesday , after recordings made by deceased members of the @entity38 were passed to police , officers arrested @entity42 in connection with the killing -- though he has not been charged with an offense			1
@entity13 , a mother of 10 children , was taken from her home in @entity14			0
she was reportedly killed by the @entity38 because the group believed she was a spy for the @entity56 army			1
her family say they do not believe she passed information to the @entity56			0
@entity13 's remains were found partially buried on a beach in @entity62 in 2003			0
she died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head			0
" they came about tea time and they dragged her out of the bathroom and dragged her out , " remembers @entity13 's daughter , @entity66 , who was then a teenager			0
in the tapes , @entity37 told his interviewer about @entity13 : " i knew she was being executed			2
i did n't know she was going to be buried or disappeared as they call them now			0
" @entity42 denies any involvement in the killing			2
" i believe that the killing of @entity13 and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice , " @entity42 , 65 , said in a statement posted on his party website			2
" malicious allegations have been made against me			0
" while i have never disassociated myself from the @entity38 and i never will , i am innocent in the abduction , killing or burial of mrs. @entity13 , " @entity42 said			1
long associated with the @entity38 , once considered the armed wing of @entity43 , @entity42 is a prominent @entity40 politician who helped broker peace in @entity9			1
today , @entity43 is @entity9 's second - largest opposition party			1
@entity93 , a @entity43 member and the deputy first minister of northern ireland , told reporters in @entity14 that the arrest was unnecessary , unjustified and politically motivated			0
he said he had seen the " dark side " of @entity9 policing " flex its muscles in the course of the past couple of days " and that the arrest was a " ' deliberate attempt to influence the elections that are due to take place in three weeks ' time			1
" @entity93 said he was confident that @entity42 would be able to rejoin election campaigning shortly and would " continue to lead our party in a very positive way			0
" @entity9 is part of the @entity56 , and @entity111 loyalists wanted to keep it that way			1
catholic nationalists were fighting to force the @entity56 out and reunite the north with the rest of @entity9			1
known as the @entity117 , the conflict lasted 30 years , ending in 1998 with the @entity118 that brokered peace			1
the agreement provided a political framework for power - sharing among the parties			0
reminders of @entity127 ' troubles ' rise to surface the @entity38 admitted in 1999 to killing a number of people who have become known as " @entity131 " -- those who vanished during the @entity117			1
police investigating these killings say they were alerted to the secret archive of interviews by the book , " @entity142 , " written by @entity20 archive manager @entity137 , which is based on transcripts from two of the recorded interviews			0
@entity37 said in his taped interview that @entity13 was killed because the @entity38 believed she was working with the @entity144			1
the @entity145 dismiss this claim though , saying she was too busy looking after her 10 children to be an informer			0
the @entity9 police vow to " follow the material in the @entity157 all way to court if that 's where it takes them ... they say detectives have a legal responsibility to investigate murders ... and follow all lines of inquiry			2
" the @entity56 government 's then most senior politician on @entity9 , @entity164 told @entity1 in 2012 that no one person was above the law			2
" we have to support the police to have complete operational independence in pursuing every line of inquiry in bringing those who committed crimes to justice , " @entity164 said			0
it remains to be seen if @entity42 will charged in a court of law			0
former @entity38 man @entity178 recorded a statement for the @entity18 archives and said lawyers had told him under @entity56 law tapes of interviewees could never be used in court			1
" i find it just imponderable , why the police are going down this road when they must know that there is no chance of obtaining any convictions at the end of this , " @entity178 said in 2012			0
like many other @entity193 , @entity178 said he believed the police are biased against them , trying to settle old scores and bring @entity42 and others down			0
but for @entity66 , herself a @entity40 , getting access to the tapes is about much more			2
for her , it 's not only about justice but a release from the pain of never knowing the truth			2
" they tried to destroy what life i have now , " she said			0
" they are the people who committed the crimes in this			2
" @entity42 ' arrest praised by murder victim 's family			2

recordings inside a @entity4 college library might help solve an old murder mystery
but the release of those tapes threatens to damage the fragile peace in @entity9
known as the @entity117 , the conflict lasted 30 years , and ended in 1998
the @entity38 admitted in 1999 to killing a number of people who have become known as " @entity131 "
