-- when @entity3 decided to expose the administration 's massive surveillance program , the @entity2 contractor turned to journalists he knew would be sympathetic			2
by approaching the @entity8 's @entity7 , a liberal columnist for a liberal newspaper , and filmmaker @entity11 , who @entity7 has credited with " exposing truths that are adverse to @entity18 government policy , " @entity3 was following an increasingly common path for leakers of sensitive material : find a like - minded soul in the media			1
and in doing so , they are bypassing the establishment press , which is then forced to play catch - up			2
true , @entity3 wound up sharing part of his scoop with national security reporter @entity26 , who wrote about the government 's internet surveillance for his former newspaper , the @entity29			2
but the fact that @entity26 and the @entity29 balked at the source 's request that they commit to publishing all of his batch of @entity35 slides — prompting @entity3 to say he could no longer give @entity26 the story exclusively — underscores why some leakers have grown wary of journalists who play by a traditional set of rules			1
@entity26 has said the @entity29 consulted with administration officials about the story and withheld some details at their request			2
opinion : why @entity47 spying scares the world when i asked @entity7 on @entity0 why the source had approached him , he cited a history of " supine behavior , subservient behavior in the @entity18 media			1
" @entity7 pointed to multiple examples of news organizations having sat on classified information " at the request of the @entity18 government , " most notably the @entity60 delaying publication of the @entity64 administration 's warrantless phone surveillance for nearly a year			1
@entity7 told me he 's not worried about getting caught up in a leak investigation , but if rep. @entity67 has his way , such journalists would be in legal jeopardy			1
" if they knew that this was classified information -- i think action should be taken , especially on something of this magnitude , " the @entity74 @entity73 told @entity0 's @entity75			2
he added that in such major cases " there is an obligation , both moral but also legal , i believe , against a reporter disclosing something which would so severely compromise national security			0
" fortunately , there is no chance that @entity67 's position , which would criminalize journalism , will become law			0
@entity7 also works for the @entity18 subsidiary of a @entity92 paper , which may have felt more freedom to expose @entity18 secrets than its @entity18 counterparts			1
( @entity92 media are more cautious at home because of their country 's strict libel laws			2
) if that was @entity3 's reasoning — and he certainly put his full trust in @entity103 , inviting him to his @entity105 hideout — he is hardly alone			0
twice in the last year , sources with liberal leanings have handed bombshell material to @entity110 , the liberal @entity111 reporter and @entity113 commentator			0
one was @entity114 , the bartender who secretly recorded @entity115 saying at a fundraiser that he would never get the votes of 47 % of @entity18 who had become addicted to government benefits			1
@entity114 not only gave the tape to @entity121 after communicating through an intermediary — @entity124 's grandson — but revealed his identity to @entity113 's @entity126			0
opinion : your biggest secrets are up for grabs it was his " civic duty " to leak the tape of the top - dollar fundraiser , @entity114 said : " there 's a lot of people that ca n't afford to pay $ 50,000 for one night , one dinner , and i felt an obligation for all the people who ca n't afford to be there			0
" @entity141 , a liberal @entity142 activist , turned to @entity121 after secretly recording @entity144 minority leader @entity143 and his strategists discussing ways to discredit actress @entity147 , a potential challenger for his seat			0
@entity141 came out publicly on the liberal website salon , saying : " i do n't subscribe to the lie that activism and journalism can be separated			0
" that , of course , runs counter to the prevailing view in the @entity157 , although newer players from the @entity159 to the @entity161 delight in delivering journalism with a topspin			0
@entity165 founder @entity164 split the difference when he did his massive dump of @entity169 cables in 2010 , giving them to the @entity8 but also to two establishment outlets , the @entity60 and @entity173 's @entity172			0
but after the @entity60 published a critical profile of @entity164 , he bypassed the paper months later in releasing a new batch of 250,000 documents to the @entity8 and other @entity179 outlets			0
( @entity8 thoughtfully shared its haul with the @entity60			0
) @entity3 , like @entity164 ( now holed up in @entity183 's @entity182 embassy while he ducks sexual assault charges ) , wanted to control the story			0
that is evident in the video interview he gave @entity7 , in which @entity3 speaks quietly but passionately about being appalled by the surveillance state			1
but that personalized approach has also made him the overriding issue , an easier and more polarizing debate for the media than government spying and illegal disclosures			1
the same technology that enabled the administration to keep track of @entity199 searches and @entity201 postings also allowed @entity3 to gain instant fame by beaming his image around the world			0
once sources who wanted public attention had little choice but to approach the mainstream media ; that 's why @entity210 dealt with @entity211 and @entity212 went to the @entity60			1
but although @entity3 opted to work within the media system , some activists now prefer to be their own broadcasters			2
opinion : massive spying on @entity18 is outrageous @entity218 , the conservative activist who pulled off stings against @entity220 and @entity221 , did n't have to hand his undercover video to a news organization			1
while he has sometimes favored conservative outlets , @entity218 packages the material himself ( and , in the case of @entity220 , engaged in misleading editing )			0
@entity218 told me in 2011 that " reporters do a lot of stenography in this country , " but that " real investigative reporting is showing things for what they are			0
" @entity218 's contention that the press is n't doing its job carries echoes of @entity7 's argument , from the other end of the spectrum , that the press is subservient to political power			1
little wonder , then , that journalists such as @entity7 and @entity121 are grabbing big scoops that once might have belonged to the @entity249			1
what may be lost is the media 's role as neutral arbiter , a sense that they are holding their sources accountable even while disseminating their information			1
but in the age of the partisan press , traditional journalists may simply have to take a back seat to those more in tune with the leakers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 .			2

@entity267 : @entity270 journalists have been *recipients* of some big scoops
he says leakers who once might have only gone to mainstream media now have other options
@entity7 says @entity18 press has a history of behavior subservient to government
@entity267 : role of mainstream media as a neutral arbiter may be *eroding*
