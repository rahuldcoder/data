-- if your air hostess seem better suited to a fashion runway than an airport runway , it may be because her uniform has a designer label			2
recently , there 's been a rash of cabin crew going couture			1
last month , @entity13 carrier @entity12 tapped @entity14 -- whose designs have graced the backs of celebrities ranging from @entity18 to @entity19 -- to revitalize the staff apparel			1
@entity21 is currently doing the same for @entity22 ( stewardesses will start wearing the uniforms on trial next month )			1
" it could have something to do with the changing of the airline industry			0
everyone is having to approach the business differently , and everyone is having to put an emphasis on look , " says @entity31 designer @entity30 , who in addition to clothing the likes of @entity33 and @entity34 crafted the new uniforms for @entity38 last april			1
high - end airlines put an emphasis on excellence , @entity30 says , and @entity38 is no different			1
" they apply the principle to everything : the food , the design of the interiors , the lounges			0
it 's the same with the uniforms , " he explains			1
the updated outfits feature a haute take on @entity38 ' red triangle logo			1
@entity30 referenced the graphic in the uniform tops , which are navy blue with ruby red and fuchsia pink diagonal stripes across the shoulder			1
" the uniforms have to be identifiable and easily seen			0
you want to be able to see from afar the staff you 're looking for			0
when you 're running around an airport , you 're constantly looking for the logo of the aircraft , " he says			0
moreover , @entity30 's design has an on - trend retro feel to it			1
the ensemble includes a trilby - style hat made from recycled bottle tops and trench coat			0

" [ the accessories ] very much came from staff feedback			0
they said , ' we want the glamor back			1
we want hats , gloves , the whole kitten caboodle			0
' " though @entity21 's designs have not been unveiled yet , sketches suggest that the female staff will have gloves			2
some of the items will also be made from a polyester yarn made from used plastic bottles			0
in a statement released by @entity22 , @entity21 said the uniforms would be in keeping with her " enduring interest in ' 40s @entity111 couture			1
" some airlines have been sporting designer threads for years			0
@entity115 had @entity116 -- previously artistic director of @entity111 fashion house @entity117 -- overhaul their uniforms in 2000			1
@entity120 staff , meanwhile , have been wearing costumes crafted by @entity122 since 2005			1
" because we have ' @entity120 ' in our name , we 're an ambassador for the country , " explains @entity123 , the vice president of branding for @entity120			2
" the idea is that we should give our customers the best @entity111 can bring them , and when you 're thinking about @entity111 , you 're thinking about food , you 're thinking about wine , and you 're thinking about fashion			2
" airlines have a long tradition of collaborating with designers			2
@entity136 notably crafted some space - age - style uniforms in 1965 for the now - defunct @entity139			0
still , @entity123 maintains it 's actually quite difficult finding people willing to take on such a limiting project			0

" it has to be comfortable , it has to be in materials that are not flammable , it has to be flattering to everybody -- blonde , redhead or brunette , thin women and not so thin women			0
and it has to be in keeping with the brand colors			0
it 's very challenging for a fashion designer to work under these constraints , and that 's why it 's not always easy to find one willing to do it			2
" still , @entity30 says for him at least , it 's long been a fantasy			1
" i 've loved the essence of flight since i was a child , " he says			2
" i love the idea of groups of people looking smart , looking tailored and being part of a team			0
