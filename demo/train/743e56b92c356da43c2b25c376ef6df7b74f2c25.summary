-- a @entity3 man tied to @entity4 , who was in @entity6 in the days after 9/11 , is out of the @entity8 military prison in @entity9 , @entity10 , where he 'd been held for the last 12 years , the @entity1 said tuesday			1
the @entity1 announced the transfer of @entity12 to the @entity3 government			1
it was n't immediately clear how @entity3 will handle @entity12 's case , including if he 'll be freed totally			2
regardless , the move represents a major milestone for @entity12 , who has pressed for his release for years and whose family has long professed his innocence			0
according to a 2010 @entity8 appeals court document on his case , @entity12 , who was born in @entity25 in 1977 , traveled to @entity6 in august 2001			1
he says he went there to do charity work and teach the @entity29 , the @entity30 holy text , to the poor and needy ; the @entity8 government says he went to join the @entity33 in its fight against the @entity35			1
upon his arrival , @entity12 met with a @entity33 official who he said took him to schools around the @entity6 countryside			1
federal prosecutors dispute this assertion , saying that @entity12 could n't name any of the schools he went to , fellow teachers or students			0
he was in the longtime @entity33 stronghold of @entity45 on september 11 , 2001 , the day that members of @entity4 -- the terrorist group led by @entity48 that had found a home in @entity6 -- hijacked four @entity8 commercial airliners and crashed them , killing nearly 3,000 people			1
@entity52 rented a car and drove to eastern @entity6 's @entity55 province , contending that he wanted to leave the country			2
but he did not , instead staying there about a month before acquiring an @entity59 rifle that he had while walking around the mountainous @entity61 region with about 150 men			0
@entity61 is where @entity8 forces and their allies cornered @entity48 in december 2001 , before he managed to escape into @entity66 , according to a @entity68 report			2
his group came under attack at one point , but @entity12 survived unscathed			0
yet his ordeal came to an end in late 2001 , when @entity66 guards detained him at @entity66 's border with @entity6			1
@entity52 was then passed to @entity8 authorities , and he was moved to @entity9 in early 2002			2
federal authorities have tied @entity78 to @entity4 on a number of fronts , including that his name appeared in a document on the terrorist group 's official website and that his passport was found in an @entity4 safe house yet his father , who fought alongside @entity8 forces in the first @entity89 , says @entity12 has been wrongly imprisoned			1
" he went in 2001 , trying to help people and teach them , " @entity90 told @entity0 in january 2003			0
" then 9/11 happened , and he was caught there during the war			0
" @entity52 's release leaves 148 prisoners still at @entity9 , which was repurposed after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks to hold detainees in the so - called war on terror			0
since they were not on @entity8 soil , then - president @entity101 's administration said @entity9 detainees were not covered by the @entity104 and instead were " enemy combatants , " a label that gave them limited legal protections			0
president @entity109 signed an executive order to close the @entity9 detention center days after his 2009 inauguration			0
yet , while the number of detainees has dwindled -- through releases like that of @entity12 , as well as controversial swaps this year of five prisoners for @entity116 sgt. @entity115 , an @entity8 soldier captured in @entity6 -- the facility remains open			1
former @entity9 inmates tell of confessions under ' torture '			0

@entity66 border guards captured @entity12 in late 2001
he says he 'd gone to @entity6 to teach the @entity29 to *children*
the @entity8 government says he went to join the @entity33 , ties him to @entity4
