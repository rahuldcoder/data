-- islamists attacked a gas field in eastern @entity3 , killing two people and seizing hostages , including @entity6 , @entity3 's interior minister said wednesday			1
the incident may be linked to @entity10 's military support for the government of nearby @entity12 , according to reports from the region			2
the @entity6 , accompanied by @entity3 security forces , were en route to @entity19 when they were attacked early in the morning by a group of no more than 20 people , the official , @entity16 , told @entity3 state television			1
the security forces returned fire , and the attackers withdrew to the base of the petroleum operation , some 3 kilometers away , he said			0
upon arrival at the base , he continued , the attackers " took in a number of @entity6 and @entity3 -- some people told us they were nine , some people told us 12			1
" @entity36 spokeswoman @entity35 said @entity37 were among the hostages			1
accounts over the number differed			0
an @entity3 and a @entity42 were killed in the attack , and two other @entity6 , two of the security forces and two guards from the base were wounded , @entity41 said			1
a spokesperson for @entity51 's @entity50 , citing the @entity3 government , said a @entity51 national was among the dead			1
@entity51 foreign minister @entity55 , speaking in @entity53 , @entity54 , said the captives included " a number of @entity51 nationals			1
" @entity55 said the @entity50 had sent a " rapid deployment team " to @entity59 to beef up staffing at the embassy			2
@entity3 military forces were surrounding the building holding the hostage - takers and the hostages , @entity41 said			1
late wednesday , the hostage - takers released the @entity3 they had been holding but continued holding the @entity6 , @entity3 state television reported			1
the group has issued demands , but they elicited no response , @entity41 said			0
" the authorities do not negotiate , no negotiations ; we have received their demands , but we did n't respond to them , " he added			0
a @entity76 news agency , @entity75 , said the attackers demanded in a news release an end to " brutal aggression on our people in @entity12			0
" it cited " blatant intervention of the @entity10 crusader forces in @entity12 " and accused the world of having left @entity85 's people " groaning under the pressure of the butcher " president @entity87			2
the news release said they chose to carry out the operation in @entity3 because the country 's president , @entity92 , had allowed @entity10 military forces to cross @entity3 air space in attacking @entity12			1
a @entity37 official was skeptical			2
" the level of planning suggests that this was in train before the @entity10 overflights ever took place , " the official said			0
that view was echoed by another @entity37 official , who told @entity0 's @entity105 that , " as of now , the attack appeared organized , " not put together quickly or opportunistic			1
the official said it was likely that the attackers had cited @entity3 's opening of its air space to @entity10 fighters as the reason for the attack to protect their operational methods and make the attack appear spontaneous			1
the news release put the number of hostages at " more than 40 , " including seven @entity37 , two @entity10 , two @entity51 and a number of other @entity119			1
an @entity121 group claiming responsibility for the attack told the @entity123 and @entity124 that 41 " westerners including seven @entity37 , ( as well as ) @entity10 , @entity51 and @entity126 citizens have been taken hostage			1
" but the real number of @entity37 hostages could be as few as three , two @entity37 officials said wednesday			1
the @entity3 press service , citing a source from the provincial administration of @entity135 , reported that " a little more than 20 foreign nationals are held hostage			1
" defense secretary @entity138 , in @entity119 meeting with @entity141 allies , called the incident " a terrorist attack			1
" nine or 10 @entity37 were working at the site , and @entity37 officials were trying to determine who had been abducted , a @entity36 official told @entity0			1
the source said the abductors were demanding that members of their group being held prisoner be released and sent to northern @entity12			0
the official was not clear about where the prisoners were			0
" the first priority is to gain understanding of what is happening , " a senior @entity37 official with direct knowledge of the matter said			2
" we are working on ways to improve that now			0
" the official added that a special operations team -- the @entity167 -- " is on a very short string			0
" he said that " another important piece will be for @entity169 to really lock down the nearby border on their side , " so personnel and weapons can not get through			0
a @entity37 official said the capability existed " to see the area " around the facility and that the ability to monitor the situation will " improve soon			2
" the @entity167 unit is prepared to move within four hours of being ordered to do so , a @entity37 defense official told @entity0			2
the official said that , before the hostage incident , the unit had been headed to @entity185 , where it was to be on standby for missions in @entity12 , but that it may now move elsewhere			2
a second @entity37 official said that any operation would take time to unfold			2
" this is not the type of mission that you plan and execute overnight , it 's just not , " the official said			2
" we do n't know specifically how many militants or hostages there are			0
but with so little information , if you 're talking dozens of militants and up to 40 hostages , i do n't see how you go in without killing half the hostages			0
" the second official said that @entity207 would be deployed only to augment security at any nearby embassies			0
they would not be deployed for field operations in any rescue attempt , the official said			0
the @entity218 's @entity217 is taking the military lead on the matter , and the @entity36 and @entity221 are the lead agencies in contact with the @entity3 government , a defense official said			1
the official said commanders have assets " not too far away , " including aircraft from the @entity230 's base in @entity231 , @entity232 , and a @entity233 in @entity234 , @entity232			0
any action would need to be approved by @entity3 , " which is more than just a formality , " the official said			2
a spokesman for the group -- whose name means " those who sign with blood " -- said that jihadists controlled the plant			0
saying that the operation was an act of revenge against @entity3 , the spokesman said 400 @entity3 soldiers were on the site " who have not been targeted by jihadists			2

the gas field lies about 60 kilometers west of the @entity169 border and some 1,300 kilometers from the capital , @entity59 , @entity273 said			1

in a statement , rep. @entity307 , @entity308 , called the attack " the latest demonstration of a large and growing radical movement across @entity313 " and said the @entity10 " have acted appropriately " in intervening in @entity12			0
