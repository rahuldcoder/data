-- the decision to give @entity3 's son - in - law civilian , not military , treatment has reignited passionate differences of opinion on which type of justice is appropriate for someone who wages war on the @entity12			0
several @entity13 insist that @entity14 , the @entity3 relative who was also @entity15 's chief spokesman , should be sent to the detention compound in the @entity12 naval base at @entity18 in @entity19			1
@entity14 pleaded not guilty friday in @entity20 to charges of conspiring to kill @entity12 as part of terrorism			2
civilian prosecution " makes little sense , and reveals , yet again , a stubborn refusal to avoid holding additional terrorists at the secure facility at @entity18 despite the circumstances , " senate minority leader @entity26 said of the administration 's decision			1
president @entity33 has pledged to close the @entity18 facility , controversial for alleged human rights violations , including interrogation techniques that a 2006 @entity38 report said " amounted to torture			1
" " at @entity18 , he could be held as a detainee and fulsomely and continuously interrogated without having to overcome the objections of his civilian lawyers , " @entity40 said			1
" @entity14 has sworn to kill @entity12 , and he likely possesses information that could prevent harm to @entity12 and its allies			2
" federal prosecutors said @entity14 gave investigators a 22 - page statement after his arrest , but they did n't reveal any of what the terror suspect said			1
sen. @entity54 , @entity55 , also said that @entity14 should have been sent to @entity18			1
" if you are that close to @entity3 , " he said , " we want to develop all the information that person has			0
" " i think we ( are ) setting a new precedent that will come back to bite us , " sen. @entity59 , @entity61 - @entity60 , told reporters			0
" it 's clear to me they snuck him in ... under the nose of @entity68			0
" the @entity69 says it examined the nature of @entity14 's alleged offenses and whether charges would better be served in federal court or through a military commission			1
" in this case , the president 's national security team examined this matter and unanimously agreed that prosecution of @entity14 in federal court will best protect the national security interests of the @entity12 , " department spokesman @entity75 said in a written statement			1
@entity85 spokesman @entity84 said the administration can bring @entity14 to justice while obtaining intelligence from him			1
" we 're able to do both , " @entity84 said			0
from at least may 2001 to 2002 , @entity14 appeared with @entity3 and his then - deputy @entity91 and warned that attacks similar to 9/11 would continue , @entity84 said			2
" so , this is somebody who is going to be held accountable for his crimes , " @entity84 said			0
evidence in the court case has been sealed , and prosecutors said they were reviewing classified evidence to see if it would be used in @entity14 's trial			1
@entity14 's 22 - page statement could be admitted in federal court if he was given a @entity105 warning , but military tribunals could allow the statement even if the warning was n't given , @entity0 legal analyst @entity101 said			1
" so that 's a clear difference " between the two systems , @entity101 said			0
information obtained by torture , however , is n't admissible in a @entity18 military tribunal , @entity101 added			2
" the government has said they will not attempt , even against major ( terror ) figures like @entity117 , to use information that was obtained through water boarding , " @entity101 said			0
@entity0 security analyst @entity119 said @entity14 appears not to have been involved in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity12			2
rather , he emerged as an @entity15 figure after the attacks , @entity119 said			0
" he 's really been a sort of bit player -- not to say that it is n't important that he goes on trial , " he said			0
military legal expert @entity128 said the conspiracy charge against @entity14 is not a war crime and is outside the jurisdiction of a military commission			2
the @entity133 has described @entity14 as " the official spokesman of @entity15 since his appointment to that position after the attacks of september 11 , 2001			1
" he has appeared in videos as " the mouthpiece of @entity3 , " the department said			0
in january , the @entity141 reassigned the special envoy dealing with the closing of the @entity18 detention facility and has no plans to replace him , leaving the administration 's timetable for closing the facility in question .			0

@entity152 : " we 're able to do both , " @entity33 spokesman says of prosecution , intelligence
@entity14 should face military prosecution , several *republicans* say
he should be interrogated at @entity18 for intelligence on @entity15 , they say
but the @entity69 says federal court protects national security
