like millions of @entity1 , i was glued to the @entity2 over the weekend			1
i loved , simply loved , @entity4 's strong , athletic performance on ice to one of my favorite songs from @entity8			1
truth told , i loved her pre-competition comments more			2
she told @entity11 , " people see figure skaters as these pretty little porcelain dolls that you put up on a shelf			0
but i am not a soft skater , and i do n't want to be			2
i am strong ; i 'm powerful ; i 'm athletic			1
most importantly to me i feel like i 'm a woman out on the ice			2
beautiful words in a world that denigrates female power by using phrases like , " man up , " " girlie men " and the " feminization of our culture			1
" and , i might add : what is wrong with that anyway ? last time i checked , roughly half our culture was already as such			1
i simply do n't equate " feminine " or " girly " with " weakness			2
" but , plenty of others -- men and women -- do			0
conservative @entity38 analyst @entity37 recently blamed a " sort of feminized atmosphere " for @entity42 gov. @entity41 's woes			0
it seems , in @entity37 's mind , our overly sensitive culture can no long abide a " masculine , muscular " guy like @entity41			1
@entity49 urged the crowd at the @entity51 in 2004 to support free enterprise and to not be " economic girlie men			0
" yes , he was capitalizing on his @entity55 image , but the phrase drew a standing ovation			0
even strong women inadvertently slam female strength			0
@entity60 urged the @entity61 to " man up " in 2010 and support @entity64 candidates			1
why did n't @entity60 shout , " woman up ? " i know , i know			0
i 've used the " man up " slam too			0
it 's fun , cutting and effective			0
but , upon further reflection , is it ? i love my friend @entity72 's story about " girlie men			1
" nine months pregnant , and standing in line at @entity76 behind two male construction workers , she overheard one of them say to the other , " you 're such a girl			0
" @entity72 , exhausted from getting up at 2:30 a.m. to arrive at work on time snapped , " then i 'm sure he 's stronger than you			0
" i do n't mean to pick on @entity61 , but perhaps the use of " man up , " " girlie men " and " the feminization of our culture " are hurting them needlessly			1
according to a new @entity95 / @entity94 poll , a majority of @entity1 , and women in particular , do not believe the @entity61 understands the problems and concerns of women today			2
as @entity99 rep. @entity99 of @entity100 told @entity95 : " when you look at our position on issues , a lot of times ( a ) majority of @entity1 agree with our positions			0
but it 's the way that we talk about it that does n't resonate , and we have to do a better job			0
i think it 's fair to say there have been some comments which are offensive and they 're not representative of the entire @entity61			1
" which brings me back to the @entity2			2
for the first time ever , women will compete in ski jumping			1
they 've been petitioning to compete in the @entity2 since 1998			2
if you 're wondering why it 's taken 16 years , a hint : according to the @entity124 , the president of the @entity126 , @entity127 , told @entity128 in 2005 that ski jumping " seems not to be appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view			1

@entity134 says @entity2 skater @entity4 calls herself a strong , athletic woman
@entity134 : she 's *refreshing* in light of remarks like " girlie man " and " feminization of culture "
what 's wrong with feminine ? the @entity61 should beware of comments like this , she says
@entity134 : in 2005 , ski jumping was not " appropriate for ladies " ; finally they 're competing
