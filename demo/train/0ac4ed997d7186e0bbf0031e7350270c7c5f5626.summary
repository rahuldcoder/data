, 3,700 post offices , 300 mail processing plants , or even the post office itself ? with millions of jobs and businesses lost to the recent recession , these may seem like just more numbers , or more seemingly inevitable " facts " -- that in the electronic age we now rely on the private sector to deliver public services			1
but postal workers are people we depend on and post offices are places we want to know will always be there			1
downsizing the @entity24 - - which is so low on money , it 's in imminent danger of default -- may seem like a ripple in this troubled economy , but it promises to be a social tsunami if action is n't taken soon to save it			1
for one thing , the postal service has been a huge employer			1
before i became a history professor i carried mail for the @entity24 for 20 years			2
as with many government jobs , you 're hired for this one based on achieving a high score on a competitive exam			0
veterans , roughly 20 % of today 's postal workforce ( though once well over 50 % ) earn extra points on this exam , thus giving them a head start and a job to come home to after military service			1
who were my co-workers ? just everyday people who , like me in 1980 , were attracted to a job that had good benefits , job security , and started at $ 8.10 an hour			0
this was as a result of the 1970 nationwide postal wildcat strike that began in @entity59 after postal workers declared they were tired of earning $ 2.95 an hour and having to work a second job or collect food stamps to make ends meet			0
in collecting oral histories for a book i later wrote on the postal service , i interviewed those who had worked before 1970 , including those who struck			1
the postal worker 's job could include processing mail as clerks and mail handlers , delivering it as letter carriers , driving it as truck drivers , and as maintenance workers keeping up the vehicles , buildings , and grounds			2
above all , postal workers were proud of having a career serving the public			0
the job allowed many to move into the ranks of middle - class wage earners , where they were able to buy homes and send their children to college			0
but they were also members of extended families and community networks			0
many started small businesses on the side , adopted foster children , were active in civic organizations , or enrolled in college classes			0
their jobs mattered to communities			0
postal jobs have especially played a key role in black community development			0
the post office has long been one of the largest employers of @entity107			1
even as they faced discrimination at other jobs , many found work there with college degrees or military service under their belts			0
by 1970 , they had become twice as likely as whites to work for the post office , and even before the wage bump that year , the job had afforded them a middle - class status and the ability to accumulate wealth			1
today the nation relies on a vast mailing industry that operates primarily for profit			0
but that network is underpinned by the @entity24 -- a self - supporting quasi-corporate government agency that remains committed to universal service by constitutional and congressional mandate			1
many @entity107 may not realize that it was the @entity24 that pioneered parcel post in 1916 in response to the overpriced , poor , and inconsistent service disaster that was private package delivery			1
or that the @entity24 came up with the concept of overnight mail and zip codes that @entity135 and @entity136 rely on so heavily in their business			2
many do n't make the connection that e-commerce not only competes with but also generates @entity142 mail			2
or that during the turn of this century -- the @entity24 's peak years of revenue and mail handling -- it was common to hear competitors and political ideologues calling for the agency 's privatization , while at the same time blocking @entity24 innovations like the proposed 1997 @entity153 program to help expedite parcels through customs			2
or that the post office is the victim of an artificial deficit created by the 2006 @entity159 , signed by president @entity160 , which forces the @entity24 to pre-fund its retiree health benefits 75 years into the future over the next 10 years			1
what should have been annual revenue surpluses for the @entity24 over the last decade have instead contributed to nightmare annual deficits as it is forced to pay $ 5.5 billion a year out of operating funds to satisfy this unnecessary and devastating mandate			2
. we lose more than numbers when we lose postal jobs and post offices , or even the existence of a universal postal service			1
we lose more than just people committed to providing service , but also people engaged with their communities			2
people able to consume goods that others produce to help drive local economies			0
we would also lose the promise of jobs in the future that provide what has become a more dependable service over two centuries since the founding of this country ( the post office was started in 1775 )			1
an alternative to this loss ? people could demand that @entity195 treat the @entity24 as a venerable @entity142 institution worthy of fulfilling its enduring mandate , for which it has recruited generations of skilled and dedicated professional government employees			1
a good start would be @entity201 1351 , introduced by rep. @entity202 , @entity203 , a bill that would at least allow the @entity24 to transfer surplus pension funds to satisfy the retiree health plan pre-fund requirement			0
and that pre-fund requirement ultimately needs to be repealed to keep the @entity24 from running off the rails			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212			0

@entity214 says the @entity24 *threatened* by major cuts or even closure
he says post office represents people , places we rely on ; cuts will have huge effect in @entity142
he says it 's a major employer , innovator and *fulcrum* of national communications system
@entity212 : @entity195 must assume *responsibilty* for finding a way for postal service to stay *afloat*
