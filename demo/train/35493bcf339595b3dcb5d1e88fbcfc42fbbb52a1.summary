-- july 22 , 2011 download a @entity2 map related to today 's show : @entity4 transcript this is a @entity7			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
first up : @entity11 @entity12 , @entity13 : hey , i 'm @entity15 , reporting from @entity4 this week where -- get this -- it is actually hotter than it is 500 miles south in @entity18 , @entity19 at @entity0 's world headquarters ! the reason for the sizzlin ' is a heat wave that 's stretching over the eastern part of the @entity25 caused by this high pressure weather system that 's expanding across the country			1
we 've got something for you today , though , that 'll hopefully help you cool off			0
i 'm joined by my @entity33 colleague @entity32 , who 's going to talk to us about what to eat to stay cool on the inside while you seek shade on the outside			1
@entity40 , @entity32 ? @entity41 , @entity0 national correspondent : right , @entity15			1
it 's great to have you here , even though it 's super hot here in @entity4			1
and when the weather 's like this , sometimes you do n't really feel like eating			1
but a nutritionist tells me that it 's actually really important that you do , because you want to replenish all the water that you 're losing when you 're out there sweating it out			1
( begin video ) @entity58 : when the weather is hot and sticky , the foods you love may not seem as appetizing			1
but you can help your body beat the heat by changing your grocery list			1
@entity65 , @entity66 : we need to be eating , and we need to be eating light meals , eating often , and we also want to make sure that we replace a lot of the water that we lose when we 're sweating			2
@entity58 : to replace that water , registered dietitian @entity71 recommends stocking up on fruits and veggies , which are almost all water , and quite nutritious			0
@entity76 : some of the nutrients that you get in dairy foods , you can actually get in vegetables			2
for example , a lot of our leafy greens are a good source of calcium			0
@entity58 : fill your cart with alternative sources of fat , instead of processed or , especially , fried foods			2
@entity76 : they 're so hot , so hard to digest , with all that extra fat in there			1
your best sources of fat in this heat are going to be fat from seeds and nuts and avocados			2
@entity58 : and most people know to stay hydrated , but check the labels on flavored waters and other drinks			0
@entity76 : a lot of waters are kind of " fancified , " and they 've got artificial colors and flavors			0
some can have more than a day 's worth of sugar in just one bottle			2
@entity58 : be sure to check the caffeine content of drinks as well			0
( @entity114 ) goodbye @entity58 : and you want to be sure you 're not taking in too much caffeine and things like soda and things like iced coffee , because when it 's really hot outside and you 're working and you 're running around , your heart rate can start racing really fast			1
you want to avoid that , especially in the heat , @entity15			2
@entity125 : well , you know @entity32 , i always resort to ice cream			0
i usually think , okay , maybe it 's not so healthy , but it cools me off			2
can i stick with that ? @entity58 : you can stick with that in moderation , like all good things			0
you know , there 's a lot of sugar and there 's a lot of fat in some ice cream , so you do n't want to eat ice cream 24/7 , seven days of the week			0
you might want to stick with sorbet , or another option that the nutritionist gave us is some frozen fruit			0
maybe sticking some watermelon or grapes in the freezer , and then take them out for a nice cool snack			0
@entity125 : all right , @entity32			0
thanks so much for being with us on @entity0 .			1
