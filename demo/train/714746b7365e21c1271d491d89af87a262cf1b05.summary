@entity0 -- a @entity3 presidential debate on tuesday focused on national security issues exposed deep fault lines within the @entity3 over how to grapple with the nation 's challenges overseas			1
the eight @entity3 candidates who took to the @entity1 debate stage in downtown @entity0 differed on a range of issues confronting the @entity12 , including the war in @entity14 , aid to @entity16 and cuts in defense spending			1
the issue of illegal immigration also arose again as the newest @entity3 front - runner , former house speaker @entity21 , called for a " humane " approach to immigration policy , a position at odds with many conservative activists who dominate key nominating contests in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity31 stressed the importance of securing the @entity12 border with @entity34 and penalizing employers who hire illegal immigrants			1
but he expressed sympathy for people who entered the country illegally and since became contributing members of society			2
blog : the @entity1 debate as it happened " i do n't see how the party that says it 's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families which have been here a quarter - century , " @entity31 said			1
" and i am prepared to take the heat for saying , let 's be humane in enforcing the law without giving them citizenship , but finding a way to give them legality so as not to separate them from their families			2
" the answer was reminiscent of @entity65 gov. @entity64 's response to a question about a 2001 bill he signed that granted in - state college tuition to the children of illegal immigrants			1
in a september debate , @entity64 said @entity3 who oppose the legislation " do n't have a heart " -- and his standing in the polls plummeted in the following days			1
@entity77 , the party 's @entity79 front - runner for much of the year , pounced on @entity31 's remarks			1
" @entity82 is a magnet , " @entity77 said			2
" when we have had in the past programs that have said that if people who come here illegally are going to get to stay illegally for the rest of their life , that 's going to only encourage more people to come here illegally			2
" @entity91 : what makes a good presidential candidate ? @entity95 rep. @entity94 , a member of the @entity96 who had one of her strongest debate performances of the cycle , also chided @entity31			1
" we need to move away from magnets , not offer more , " said @entity94 , who is in single digits in the polls and pegging her candidacy to a strong showing in the @entity28 caucuses			1
the debate was held at @entity107 in downtown @entity0 and was co-sponsored by the @entity108 and the @entity109 , two conservative think tanks			2
@entity31 entered the debate with fresh momentum in the @entity3 race and found himself in the spotlight for much of the evening			1
according to a @entity1 / @entity117 released on the eve of the debate , 24 % of @entity3 and @entity3 - leaning independent voters said they are most likely to support @entity31 for their party 's nomination , with 20 % saying they back @entity77 , who is making his second bid for the presidency			1
@entity31 's four - point margin over @entity77 is within the survey 's sampling error			1
a @entity1 poll released one week ago had @entity77 at 24 % and @entity31 at 22 %			1
@entity31 was at 8 % in a @entity1 poll in october			1
the new front - runner got the first question of the night , which sparked a feud with the libertarian - leaning @entity65 rep. @entity134 over the @entity135			1
" i would look at strengthening it because the dangers that are posed are so great , " @entity31 said about the legislation			1
@entity134 , who has been sharply critical of the @entity135 since it was signed into law by former president @entity141 in october 2001 , called it " unpatriotic " because it " undermines our liberty			2
" @entity134 took on the role of the lonely isolationist throughout the debate , calling on the administration to withdraw @entity12 troops from commitments overseas as a way to slash government spending			2
he also questioned the point of humanitarian aid , including money to combat @entity157 and other diseases in @entity159			0
" i think the aid is all worthless , " @entity134 said			0
" it does n't do any good for most of the people			0
you take money from poor people in this country and you end up giving it to rich people in poorer countries			0
" in the night 's sharpest clash , @entity77 and former @entity172 gov. @entity171 battled over the @entity12 military presence in @entity14			0
@entity171 , a former ambassador to @entity175 and the sole candidate with diplomatic experience , said he wants to withdraw most @entity12 troops from the country and instead rely on predator drones and a small contingent of forces to fight terrorists			0
" are you suggesting , governor , that we just take all our troops out next week ? " @entity77 asked			0
" did you hear what i just said ? " @entity171 fired back			0
" i said we should draw down from 100,000			0
we do n't need 100,000 troops , many of whom ca n't even cross the wire			0
" when @entity77 said the president should rely on the generals on the ground , @entity171 again responded aggressively			0
" at the end of the day the president of the @entity12 is commander - in - chief , " he said			2
" of course you 're going to listen to the generals			0
but i also remember when people listened to the generals in 1967 and we heard a certain course of action in @entity205 that did n't serve our interests very well			0
" the candidates were also pressed on how they would change airport security measures if elected president			1
@entity65 gov. @entity64 said he would privatize the @entity210			0
former @entity212 sen. @entity211 said his administration would apply " more scrutiny " to @entity215 passengers in airports , as did former @entity218 ceo @entity217			0
" if you take a look at the people who are trying to kill us it would be easy to figure out , " @entity217 said			0
later , @entity95 rep. @entity94 dueled with @entity64 over his proposal to scrap all funding for foreign governments like @entity16 , which may not agree with @entity12 interests , and ask them to make the case for @entity12 funding			2
@entity64 said the government should stop writing " blank checks " to @entity16 , but @entity94 called that proposal " @entity237 " because the country has nuclear weapons that must be protected			0
" @entity238 could get a hold of these weapons , " @entity94 said .			0
