-- the @entity1 asked wednesday that a federal shield law be reintroduced in the @entity3 , a move that could affect the way the @entity6 conducts investigations into leaks of secret government information			1
administration officials told @entity0 that the request was made to sen. @entity12 , @entity14 - @entity13			2
it comes two days after the @entity16 announced that the @entity6 had seized some of its phone records as part of a national security leak investigation			1
" this kind of law would balance national security needs against the public 's right to the free flow of information , " @entity12 said in a statement			2
" at minimum , our bill would have ensured a fairer , more deliberate process in this case			0
" the records covered a two - month period beginning in may 2012 and included more than 20 @entity16 lines , including personal phones and @entity16 phone numbers in @entity13 ; @entity38 , @entity39 ; and @entity40			1
" a shield law would keep lazy prosecutors from going after reporters ' notes and phone records and compel them to actually conduct investigations that do not step all over the @entity42 , " @entity41 , the @entity42 chairwoman of the @entity43 , said in a statement issued before the @entity1 announcement			1
federal shield legislation -- which would protect journalists from revealing their sources and beef up protections for reporters and their sources caught up in such probes -- passed the @entity59 in 2009 but never advanced			1
the @entity16 phone records controversy pits @entity42 advocates against an administration that has made unprecedented moves to end the leaking of government secrets in the name of national security			1
" if there were a shield law and it said that the government has to let you know when it 's subpoenaing your phone records , your hotel records or any other records that you do n't have in your hands , that would have been a big help , " said @entity68 , chairman of the media law department at the law firm of @entity71 in @entity40 , who has represented the @entity16 and @entity0 in the past			1
his comments too were made before the @entity1 announcement			0
related : @entity6 defends itself in @entity16 snooping scandal " they kept that information from journalists and went to the phone company to prevent giving journalists the chance to fight in court , " @entity68 said in a telephone interview			1
" that kind of end - run could be prevented if there were a federal shield law that required notice when the government goes after records from third parties			1
" he added , " it 's colossally troubling to everybody , and should be , that the government can come between journalists and their sources in this kind of an unfocused and unbridled fashion			2
" typically , he said , the government negotiates with the news media to ensure that any subpoena is tailored as narrowly as possible			2
but in this instance , " the government issued what appears to be an overbroad subpoena , " skipping the step of notifying the journalists ahead of time , which would have given them the opportunity to challenge it			2
" and they did it on purpose , " he said			0
" they did not want to give the journalists an opportunity to try to get this narrowed or quashed			0
" @entity6 regulations allow the government to seize records only in the case of " a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation , " @entity68 said , adding that that did not appear to have been the case with the @entity16 probe			1
" it 's hard to imagine that there was a substantial threat to an investigation of past events that would warrant not giving @entity16 a chance to go to court on this issue , " he said			1
" that 's deeply troubling			0
" the wire service said the investigation into its records appears related to an @entity16 story about a thwarted terrorist plot in @entity151 to bomb an airplane bound for the @entity153			1
" these records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the @entity16 during a two - month period , provide a road map to @entity16 's newsgathering operations , and disclose information about @entity16 's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know , " said @entity154 , @entity16 's president and ceo , in a letter of protest sent monday to attorney general @entity158			1
@entity154 said tuesday in a statement that the news organization had taken extraordinary measures to placate federal authorities , delaying publication of the story , at their request , " until the government assured us that the national security concerns had passed			1
" at the time of publication , the administration itself was preparing to announce that the bomb plot had been foiled , he said			2
" the @entity1 had said there was no credible threat to the @entity153 people in may of 2012			0
the @entity16 story suggested otherwise , and we felt that was important information and the public deserved to know it			1
" but @entity158 told reporters on tuesday that the article that prompted the investigation was one of " the top two or three most serious leaks that i 've ever seen			2
" he testified wednesday to the @entity201 that he could not comment on the matter because he had recused himself from the case to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest and that the matter was being handled by a deputy			0
forty states have passed shield laws and nine others have de facto shield laws created by court decisions ( @entity214 is the outlier ) , according to the @entity216 , which offers legal advice and other resources to journalists			2
but the state laws confer no protection from federal actions like the one reported by the wire service			2
in the past decade , @entity225 has come close to passing a federal shield law			1
but support for the measure shrank during the @entity229 scandal in which thousands of classified @entity153 diplomatic cables were released			0
such a law could keep federal authorities from employing what some media lawyers decry as overly aggressive tactics			1
the issue has been muddied as the @entity237 has blurred the line between journalist and private citizen			2
under a federal shield law introduced in 2011 , the federal government would have had to prove to a judge that the information it was seeking outweighed the journalist 's need to keep confidential information , according to the @entity249			1
two years later , it remains in a subcommittee			0
the @entity6 's seizure of @entity16 's phone records appears to have been legal , said @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity254			1
" a lot of people think the @entity42 protects journalists from having to disclose this sort of information , " he said monday			0
there is no privilege to protect this kind of information			0
" but administrations since the @entity267 have exercised restraint , he said			0
" they have said , ' look , we will do whatever we can to avoid having to subpoena journalists			0
' " president @entity272 had indicated he would follow suit			1
a day after he entered office , on january 21 , 2009 , @entity272 said that he would embrace openness			1
" transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency , " he vowed			2
that promise has not been kept , legal analysts contend			0
the @entity272 administration has used the @entity285 , which was passed in 1917 , to target suspected leakers in six cases , twice the number undertaken by all previous administrations combined			1
@entity254 said the @entity16 's subpoena was particularly egregious			1
" i have never heard of a subpoena this broad , " he said			0
" the administration is not violating the @entity42 , but they are certainly doing more than has ever been done before in pursuing the private information of journalists , and we will see if there is any political check on them , because there does n't appear to be any legal check on what they 're doing			2
" such seizures risk turning the news media 's news - gathering process into an investigative tool of the government , said @entity306 , senior vice president and executive director of the @entity308			2
" reporters become effectively recorders of contacts and information for the prosecution , not at all what journalism is supposed to be			0
" but a former spokesman for the @entity6 who worked as an aide to @entity158 defended the government 's actions			0
" what they 're trying to find out through this investigation is what government official broke the oath that they signed to protect classified information , " said @entity319 , who left the @entity6 in 2011 and is now a public affairs consultant in private practice			0
" there is no reporters ' privilege in law protecting their records			1
" the @entity6 could have been even more aggressive , forcing the reporters to testify and throwing them in jail had they refused , he said			0
besides , federal authorities have an incentive to find out who leaked the story that goes beyond the case , he said			0
" the government has to send a signal to its employees that these laws mean something , and they will investigate and prosecute you for violating them			0
" whether a federal shield law would keep the @entity6 from carrying out such actions " would totally depend on what the federal shield law looks like , " @entity319 said , noting that several versions have been proposed			1
some would prevent reporters from ever being subpoenaed , others would allow judges to carve out exceptions in cases of national security			0
@entity1 press secretary @entity361 reiterated on tuesday that the administration had no involvement in any criminal investigation by the @entity6			0
presidential historian @entity365 predicted that the move will have little long - term impact			0
" it seems to be a kind of a strange , isolated case , " he said in a telephone interview			0
he predicted the @entity272 administration would back off rather than court further outrage			1
@entity0 's @entity374 contributed to this report			0

proposed federal shield law might have protected @entity16 from seizure of records
the @entity272 administration has taken a hard line against government leakers
