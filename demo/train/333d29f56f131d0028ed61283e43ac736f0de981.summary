@entity1 , @entity0 -- picture this : you 're sat down for the @entity5 final , or a long - awaited sequel to the " @entity8 " movie and you 're watching all the action unfold in @entity10 on your coffee table			1
the future of television ? this image is an impression of what 3d holographic television may look like			1
it sounds a lot like a wacky dream , but do n't be surprised if within our lifetime you find yourself discarding your plasma and lcd sets in exchange for a holographic @entity10 television that can put @entity28 in your living room or bring you face - to - face with life - sized versions of your gaming heroes			1
the reason for renewed optimism in three - dimensional technology is a breakthrough in rewritable and erasable holographic systems made earlier this year by researchers at the @entity39			1
dr @entity40 , chair of photonics and lasers at the university 's @entity43 , told @entity2 that scientists have broken a barrier by making the first updatable three - dimensional displays with memory			0
" this is a prerequisite for any type of moving holographic technology			1
the way it works presently is not suitable for 3 - d images , " he said			1
the researchers produced displays that can be erased and rewritten in a matter of minutes			2
to create television sets the images would need to be changing multiple times each second -- but @entity40 is very optimistic this can happen			2
he said the @entity39 team , which is now ten - strong , has been working on advancing hologram technology since 1990 -- so this is a major step forward			1
he believes that much of the difficulty in creating a holographic set has now been overcome			2
" it took us a while to make that first breakthrough , but as soon as you have the first element of it working the rest often comes more rapidly , " he said			0
" what we are doing now is trying to make the model better			0
what we showed is just one color , what we are doing now is trying to use three colors			0
the original display was four inches by four inches and now we 're going for something at least as big as a computer screen			0
" there are no more great barriers to overcome now , he said			0
the breakthrough has made some long - time researchers of the technology believe that it could now come to fruition			1
@entity94 , a retired physics professor at @entity95 outside @entity96 who had studied holography since the 1960s told @entity99 ; " when we start talking about erasable and rewritable holograms , we are moving toward the possibility of holographic tv ... it has now been shown that physically , it 's possible			1
" and what might these holographic televisions look like ? according to @entity40 , they could be constructed as a screen on the wall ( like flat panel displays ) that shows @entity10 images , with all the image writing lasers behind the wall ; or it could be like a horizontal panel on a table with holographic writing apparatus underneath			1
so , if this project is realized , you really could have a football match on your coffee table , or horror - movie villains jumping out of your wall			1
@entity40 is also optimistic that the technology could reach the market within five to ten years			2
he said progress towards a final product should be made much more quickly now that a rewriting method had been found			0
however , it is fair to say not everyone is as positive about this prospect as @entity40			0
@entity130 , a lecturer in @entity131 at @entity132 in @entity133 , told @entity2 that small steps are being made on technology like @entity10 holograms , but , he ca n't see it being ready for the market in the next ten years			1
" it 's one thing to demonstrate something in a lab but it 's another thing to be able to produce it cheaply and efficiently enough to distribute it to the mass market , " @entity130 said			0
yet , there are reasons to be optimistic that more resources will be channeled into developing this technology more quickly			2
the @entity150 government is pushing huge financial and technical weight into the development of three - dimensional , virtual - reality television , and the country 's @entity154 is aiming at having such technology available by 2020			2
@entity40 said there are no major sponsors of the technology at present , but as the breakthroughs continued , he hopes that will change			2
even if no major electronics company commit themselves , there is hope that backers could come from outside of the consumer electronics industry , he said			0
" it could have some other applications			0
in training it 's useful to show people three - dimensional displays			0
also it would be good to show things in 3 - d for defense command and control and for surgery , " he said .			0

researchers have created the first rewritable and erasable holographic images
holographic televisions could come out of the wall or up from a table
the @entity10 hologram technology could have uses in surgery or in the *military*
