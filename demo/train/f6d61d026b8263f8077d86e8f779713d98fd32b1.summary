@entity0 and i love baseball and hate sleep			1
it only made sense that , one midsummer dawn when i was 9 , we drove to the local park with our baseballs , gloves and yankee caps			1
no time is too early for a father - son catch			1
" if you thought night baseball was a thrill , just wait , " @entity0 told me			1
" morning air carries the ball like you 've never seen			1
" once we hit the dew - sprinkled field a few minutes later , i learned he was right			1
our fastballs charged faster and landed lighter into each other 's mitts			1
the echoes of our back - and - forth catches popped louder			1
and it was all as the sun rose and most of my suburban @entity29 slept			1
the park was all ours for about two hours			1
then a young mother pushed her stroller , complete with a kicking newborn , toward us			1
@entity0 paused our catch to sip from a nearby water fountain			1
when the mother and child neared , he politely leaned into the stroller , waved and gave the baby his best smile			1
but because the @entity45 's palsy still lingered , his grin looked more like a smirk			1
the mother found his smile condescending			1
she ogled at him for a second or two , then rushed her stroller away			1
@entity0 hid his mouth in his hand and walked to the car			2
he wanted to go home			2
" @entity55 , bud , " he said			2
" i 'm not feeling well			2
" a month earlier , @entity45 's palsy had struck @entity0 , paralyzing the right side of his face			1
it drooped his eyelid and left him slurring words			2
he could hardly drink from a cup or bottle without liquid spilling onto his neck and shirt			2
and his smile , which once eased the pain of playground cuts and burst at the mention of @entity72 's strut , @entity74 's films or his very own @entity75 , was gone			1
as i slumped into the car , i began suspecting that our sunrise park visit was n't about watching daylight lift beneath us			2
@entity0 had spent weeks lamenting the loss of his smile			1
this was his effort to avoid stares			2
it was a solemn drive home			2
i killed time by curving my cap 's brim and fidgeting between songs on the radio dial			1
we returned home and he went to bed			2
lying down but unable to nod off , he simply spent a few hours sighing and groaning toward the ceiling			2
after that morning , @entity0 and i did n't visit parks , nor did he want to play catch			2
he spent more time indoors			2
he left the shopping , driving and @entity102 games to @entity103			2
since being a freelance editor enabled him to work from home , he turned our dining room into his office and buried himself in manuscripts			2
when @entity0 was n't at his desk , he attended physical therapy			2
he obeyed the doctor 's orders : " now smile as wide as you can ... now lift your right cheek with your hand ... now try to whistle			1
" only the sound of blowing air came out			0
my earliest childhood memories were of @entity0 whistling to songs on the radio			0
he did n't care if the station was playing @entity124 or @entity125			0
he taught me to whistle , too			0
of the roughly 40,000 @entity127 that the @entity128 says are afflicted with @entity45 's palsy each year , most recover within several weeks			1
other cases take a few months to heal			0
but after nine weeks of therapy , @entity0 's face hardly improved , and the doctor confessed she could n't do much more to help			1
" i 've never seen anything like this , " she told him after his final session			0
then she handed him the bill			0
rather than calling another doctor or physical therapist , @entity0 stuck to humor			0
he occasionally grabbed washable markers and drew an even - sided grin across his face			0
other times , he practiced his @entity145 impersonation			0
he joked that curled lips had already lent him a handicap , thereby giving him more time to perfect his renditions of " @entity149 " and " @entity150			0
" the effort -- a regimen of shower - time vocal warmups and leg stretches -- paid off			0
he could soon don white jackets and swing his hips as if he lost himself in the @entity157			1
by the time i entered fourth grade that september , @entity0 's case of @entity45 's palsy had improved			1
he could blink his right eye and speak clearly again			0
but his smile still had n't returned			1
i tried convincing myself that it did n't matter and that smiling was overrated			0
so i abstained from making grins of any kind			0
nothing about fourth grade made my no - smiling vow easy			0
classmates were both old enough to laugh about pop culture and young enough to appreciate fart jokes , burped alphabets and straws in noses			0
breaking the promise i made myself was tempting , but i could n't let @entity0 not smile alone			1
i did n't care how hard i needed to bite my lip			0
kids would call me " @entity181			0
" ( it did n't help that i was merely 3 - foot - 10 at age nine			0
) teachers would escort me into hallways , wondering what was wrong			0
when i asked my physical education coach , " what 's so great about smiling ? " he made me do pushups while the rest of the class played wiffle ball			1
i never learned what @entity0 discussed with the coach			0
but when i got off the school bus that afternoon and saw him waiting for me , holding our mitts and ball , it did n't seem to matter			0
he tapped the brims of our matching yankee caps			0
for the first time in months , we got in the family sedan and went to the park for a catch			0
" it 's been too long , " he said			1
the park always bustled on friday afternoons			0
when we arrived , young children dashed to the nearby ice cream stand			0
mothers kissed boo - boos and gossiped			0
and roughly a half - dozen fathers and sons lined the field with mitted arms in the air			0
even if @entity0 could n't smile as widely as the others , he could n't help but beam ; neither could i. @entity220 came quickly			1
the field 's white lights glowed and everyone else left the park			1
but @entity0 and i did n't tire			0
we threw everything from curveballs to folly floaters into the night			0
we had catching up to do .			0
