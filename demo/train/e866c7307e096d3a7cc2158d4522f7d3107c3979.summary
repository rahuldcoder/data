@entity0 @entity2 is having a moment			0
as in @entity4 , the 43 - year - old senator from @entity5 , who seems to be experiencing a resurgence in popularity among fellow @entity8			1
it 's something that just six months ago , few political observers could have predicted			0
and if @entity4 is interested in applying for a job on @entity14 , as seems to be the case , the timing of this warm embrace could n't be better			1
on friday , former @entity17 gov. @entity16 bowed out of the 2016 presidential campaign , telling supporters on a call that he believes it 's " best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity " to become the nominee			1
" i feel that it is critical that @entity27 elect a conservative leader to become our next president , " @entity16 said on the call			1
" you know that i have wanted to be that president			2
but i do not want to make it more difficult for someone else to emerge who may have a better chance of becoming that president			1
" could @entity4 be that someone ? if so , a lot of people who know a lot about politics did n't see it coming			1
in fact , last summer , a @entity8 strategist who knows @entity4 fairly well told me that not only was it not a foregone conclusion that the one - time @entity8 golden boy would seek the presidency in 2016 , but he might even hang it up altogether and not even run for re-election to the @entity50			1
what 's unbelievable is that , at the time , i found this far - fetched assessment completely believable			0
back then , @entity4 seemed to be a man without a constituency			1
after landing on the cover of @entity56 in february 2013 under the headline : " the @entity58 , " @entity4 spent the next several months getting hammered by conservatives -- on cable television and talk radio -- for joining the @entity50 's " @entity66 " and proposing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants			1
some of the attacks were comical ; a top @entity4 aide told me that the @entity69 , who was born in the @entity27 , was getting nativist hate mail telling him to " go back to @entity72			1
" eventually , @entity4 caved in to the pressure and backed away from his own legislation			1
as a result , he spent most of 2014 getting hammered by the left as a flip - flopper , while being distrusted by the right , which saw him as soft on illegal immigration			0
making matters worse , by then , there was another player in this game : sen. @entity84 of @entity85 , who arrived in @entity86 in january 2013 and proceeded to do to the @entity8 establishment in the @entity50 what a candy - starved kid does to a pi√±ata			0
the fire - breathing @entity84 wasted no time in railing against " amnesty " and quickly became the @entity92 , someone who conservatives could trust to keep the border secure ( and the immigration debate safe from honesty and common sense )			0
with @entity84 's arrival , @entity4 's stock with the right dropped further			1
the self - described son of exiles was himself an exile from his own party			0
last month , @entity4 got a @entity107 present he could really use : a second chance			1
it came courtesy of the @entity111 and president @entity113 's proposed policy change to open up relations with @entity115			2
@entity4 's parents left the island in 1956 , and so they are more accurately described as immigrants than refugees			1
but , once @entity120 took power in 1959 , they were never able to return			0
so , as @entity4 has noted , they lived much of their lives in the @entity27 feeling like exiles			1
@entity4 opposes the @entity113 administration 's policy change , and he has won accolades from conservatives for offering a forceful counter view			1
which brings us back to this moment			0
think of it as the @entity4 renaissance			1
the senator has done himself a lot of good by getting out of @entity86 and meeting with @entity8 around the country			0
he is selling a new book , " @entity142 : restoring @entity143 for everyone			0
" he is also holding fundraisers , and , from the looks of it , gearing up to run for the @entity8 nomination for president			1
a @entity151 poll earlier this month showed @entity4 trailing @entity16 and @entity152 , but besting several other serious potential primary rivals , including @entity84 , @entity85 gov. @entity154 , @entity156 gov. @entity155 and @entity158 gov. @entity157			1
with @entity16 out of the race , @entity4 could soak up much of his support			1
one could assume that many of those who were " for @entity16 " took that position because they did n't want to be " for @entity152			2
" maybe now they 'll be " for @entity4			2
" @entity4 is already making a pitch to those voters			2
after the news broke that @entity16 was stepping aside , the senator said this : " over the past two years , there has n't been a day when i did n't think that @entity16 would have been a better president than @entity113			1
over the years , i 've enjoyed getting to know @entity16 and campaigning for him , was grateful for his support in my @entity50 race , and i know what a difficult decision this must be given his love of our country			2
he certainly earned the right to consider running , so i deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to lead			2
" and guess who , at 43 , is part of the next generation ? given that @entity152 and @entity4 both hail from @entity5 , you have to wonder if both will actually end up running for president next year ; things could get a little crowded in the primary			1
at 61 , @entity152 has seniority			0
but do n't count on @entity4 bowing out just to be polite			2
much has been made about the fact that @entity152 is supposedly @entity4 's political mentor , but folks close to both men claim this narrative is overblown			2
they are two @entity5 republicans , they have similar politics , and they draw from the same pool of supporters and donors			0
do n't expect any deference			0
all is fair in love , war and politics			0
it 's still very early in the 2016 saga			0
and yet the poll that really matters is the enthusiasm meter			0
these days , every time @entity4 steps into a room , he takes control of it			2
he 's there on television , arguing against opening up @entity115 and praising dissidents in @entity218			0
he 's out talking about @entity219 and other foreign policy issues , dueling with sen. @entity221 of @entity222 , who preaches a repackaged but still dangerous form of isolationism			0
and he appeared with @entity221 and @entity84 at a recent forum in @entity226 , @entity227 , and impressed attendees as someone who comes armed with substance , not just sound bites			0
a @entity227 @entity8 who saw @entity4 speak during this week 's swing through the @entity233 says she was reminded why she was once so enamored of him			2
she said he has good instincts , and that he is charming , smart , serious , and that he understands @entity27 's unique role in the world			0
i would add that @entity4 is also a fresh face and a master communicator who knows how to navigate the media			2
he is latino , and the @entity8 needs to mend fences with that group			0
he is also bilingual , so he can bring the party 's message to immigrant audiences that @entity8 usually avoid			0
all these tools will come in handy as @entity4 enters the arena and begins the long journey to what his suddenly replenished ranks of supporters hope will be the securing of the @entity8 nomination			1
this is one moment that could last a while .			0

@entity16 tells supporters friday he does not intend to run for president in 2016
