-- even though it 's set in a prison that serves tampon sandwiches for lunch , " @entity5 " is a pretty highbrow show , whether it 's quoting @entity8 , name - dropping @entity9 , or analyzing @entity10 's '' @entity11 '' in a way that will permanently alter how you interpret that poem			1
@entity17 through the second season , officer @entity15 ( @entity16 ) makes a literary reference that 's particularly spot - on			2
she 's monitoring the inmates ' telephone conversations when her eyes brighten			0
'' it 's so interesting , all these lives , '' she says			0
'' it 's like @entity26			1
" @entity5 " might be the closest thing we have to @entity26 right now : a sharp denunciation of an arcane system , driven by hardscrabble characters with whimsical names that define who they are and what they like			1
' @entity5 ' : mugshots and rap sheets this season delves further into the complicated lives of @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , and @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , making them even more sympathetic , especially when @entity46 's old drug - dealer boss @entity49 ( @entity49 ) shows up			1
) and when @entity51 ( @entity52 ) starts snooping into allegations of fraud at @entity55 , " @entity5 " continues its savvy critique of officials who benefit from the oppression of the poor — what , exactly , is @entity63 ( @entity62 ) doing with those prison funds ? — and prisoners who manipulate the goodwill of officials			1
and there 's no better satire of white privilege on television : when @entity73 ( @entity74 ) tells @entity51 that he just stood in line for hours to get a much - hyped '' bagnut '' — half bagel , half doughnut — she sighs , '' i forgot what it 's like to have all that freedom to waste			0
'' maybe that 's the biggest difference from last season : @entity51 's not the @entity85 - eating , @entity87 - shoes - buying idealist anymore , and it 's gratifying to see her lose the wide - eyed blondie shtick			2
early on , she must decide whether to tell the truth and testify against a drug lord , or lie and protect @entity94 ( @entity93 ) , and her decision makes her want to declare herself '' a lone wolf , and a vicious one			0
'' ' @entity98 ' @entity97 will star in new @entity100 drama but these women are way too caught up in one another 's lives for that , and watching how much they depend on each other in this matriarchal world can be quite moving , from @entity107 saving a piece of cake for the ever - excluded @entity110 to @entity42 helping @entity46 tailor her skirt for @entity112			1
when @entity51 wonders whether anyone would care if she died , @entity113 ( @entity114 ) is right there to reassure her			0
' ' you 're one @entity118 in the bulk box of life , '' she says , '' but you f --- in ' tickle me , so i think it would matter			0
'' okay , so that 's not exactly the stuff of @entity26 — but that does n't mean it 's not profound			2
