@entity0 -- additional @entity3 military advisers are now on the ground in northern @entity5 with the @entity7 administration considering a possible air evacuation of thousands of minority @entity9 under threat from @entity13 militants and trapped on @entity14			1
president @entity7 ordered nearly 130 advisers to @entity16 to assess the situation , and it 's now likely that a small number of them will travel to the mountain area to get a first - hand look at what might be possible			1
the new group comprised of @entity25 and special forces adds to the hundreds of other @entity3 advisers already in the country advising @entity5 troops in their fight against @entity32 militants from the @entity13 , an @entity33 off - shoot formally known as @entity34			1
the group has waged a brutal campaign while seizing large areas of territory this year in @entity5			0
it 's aiming to establish a caliphate			0
hundreds of thousands of @entity5 's ethnic and religious minorities have fled @entity34 fighters			0
nowhere is the crisis more evident than the @entity14 , where an estimated 40,000 minority @entity9 are hiding			0
the plight of the @entity9 , coupled with the @entity34 assault against @entity5 's semiautonomous @entity48 region , prompted the @entity3 to begin targeted airstrikes over the past several days			1
the aim , according to @entity7 , is to help protect @entity3 personnel in the area and to destroy @entity34 positions around the mountains to ease the threat to minority groups			0
air evacuation option @entity7 has also authorized humanitarian airdrops to help the @entity9 , and is now weighing an air evacuation , a @entity3 official told @entity1 on wednesday			1
focusing on a possible air option -- rather than a ground one -- is due to initial indications that going by land would take too long would up the risk to the @entity9 , according to the official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and asked not to be named			1
in addition , many of the stranded @entity9 are in poor medical condition to make a lengthy journey , the official said			2
however , @entity3 officials did say that a ground option is still under consideration as well			2
if an air operation is proposed and approved by @entity7 , it would require putting @entity3 ground troops both on the mountain and at a nearby airfield , the official said			1
the operation will be characterized as a short - term humanitarian mission , not a combat one			0
but @entity3 troops would have the right to defend themselves against any @entity34 attacks			1
as part of an air evacuation , @entity3 forces would establish a security corridor around the area to try to provide airspace for helicopters and other aircraft to pick up people			2
the newly arrived advisers would form the beginning of a joint task force to carry out such an operation , the official said			2
they would work to develop procedures for rescuing and then processing people taken off the mountain			0
but there are still several unresolved questions -- such as , where will the @entity9 be flown to ? asked about a potential evacuation operation on @entity1 's " @entity107 , " @entity105 spokesman rear adm. @entity104 said he did n't " want to get too far out in front " of any potential scenarios			0
" we should n't be jumping to a conclusion right now that there is or wo n't be a rescue operation in particular , " he said .			0
