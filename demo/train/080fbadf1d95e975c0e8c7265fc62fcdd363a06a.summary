-- @entity2 's @entity1 , the world 's largest and most biologically diverse lake , faces the prospect of severe ecological disruption as a result of climate change , according to team of @entity10 and @entity11 scientists			1
the baikal seal is the world 's only freshwater seal			1
publishing their analysis in @entity18 magazine the team found the most pressing threat came from the dependence of the lake 's food chain on microscopic algae			2
@entity1 's algae are particularly vulnerable to expected reductions in the length of time the lake is frozen each winter			1
the lake is considered a treasure trove for biologists and was designated a @entity31 by @entity32 because a high proportion of its rich fauna and flora are found nowhere else			1
the report 's authors say @entity1 's climate has become measurably milder over recent decades , and that annual precipitation is expected to increase			2
the average ice depth in the lake is believed to have decreased in recent decades , and the ice - free season to have increased			0
changes in the lake 's food - chain composition have been noted , the scientists say			0
shorter periods of ice cover is expected to slow the growth of the lake 's algae , the authors say ; the organisms bloom under the ice in springtime and are highly dependent on ice cover for their reproduction and growth			0
algae is the principal food of tiny crustaceans abundant in the lake , which in turn are food sources for the lake 's fish			0
the crustaceans could also be affected by changes in the transparency of the ice , an expected result of shifting precipitation and wind patterns			0
shortened periods of ice cover and changes in the ice 's transparency may also harm the baikal seal , the lake 's top predator and the world 's only exclusively freshwater seal			1
because the seals mate and give birth on the ice , premature melting forces them into the water before molting and drastically reduces their fertility , the authors say			0
a warmer , wetter climate may be the principal threat to @entity1 's unique biological heritage , but it is not the only one , say the report 's scientists			1
the secondary effects of climate change , including greater nutrient inputs and industrial pollution from melting permafrost , may also exact a toll on an already - stressed ecosystem .			2

study says climate change threatens *important* algae in @entity11 's @entity1
warmer *temperatures* could also affect world 's only freshwater seal
@entity1 is a @entity32 world heritage site for its unique flora and fauna
