-- a day after the @entity3 slapped @entity4 with a $ 219,000 fine for spending violations during his failed presidential bid , a spokeswoman for the vice president is calling the ruling " commonplace			1
" " some repayment is commonplace after presidential campaign audits and the repayment ordered here is relatively small , " said @entity4 spokeswoman @entity8			1
" payment is due to the @entity14 30 days after the @entity3 issues its formal ruling and ' @entity4 for president ' will comply with that			1
" in a report released friday , the @entity3 said a mandatory audit showed the campaign had accepted contributions above the legal limit , failed to adequately pay for rides on a private jet , and issued several checks that had never been cashed			1
specifically , the @entity3 found @entity4 had not returned more than $ 106,000 in contributions that exceeded the legal limit of $ 2,300 per - person for a presidential @entity3 also found the committee had not returned more than $ 1 million in over-the - limit contributions in " a timely manner			1
" the commission report also said the campaign failed to adequately pay for a ride three people received on a private jet between @entity37 and @entity38 in june of 2007 because the campaign reimbursed the owner of the aircraft at a significantly below - market rate			0
the reimbursement for the flight was based on comparable commercial first - class tickets			0
but because the plane was designated by the @entity48 as a charter aircraft , the campaign underpaid by close to $ 27,000 , the @entity3 report says			2
the @entity3 report also found @entity4 owes $ 86,000 as a result of stale - dated checks -- that is , checks that the payees have not cashed			2
according to the @entity3 , if the campaign has issued checks that the payees have not cashed within a reasonable time frame , the campaign must reimburse the @entity14 for the amount of the outstanding checks			0
" stale dated checks are where someone contributes over the allowed max and campaign sends back refund of overage , but the check is never cashed , " said a senior administration official in the vice president 's office			1
" this is common and obviously not in the campaign 's control			0
the excess contributions were less than 1 percent of the money raised ; the vendor errors were well under 1 percent -- one half of one percent			0
" the findings are the result of a mandatory audit because @entity4 accepted taxpayer money as a result of opting into the public financing system			0
in all , @entity4 received $ 857,189 in taxpayer funds to run his campaign			2
@entity4 dropped his bid for president in january 2008 after a fifth place finish in the @entity38 caucuses			2
