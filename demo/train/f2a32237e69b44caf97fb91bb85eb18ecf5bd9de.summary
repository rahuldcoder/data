@entity0 , @entity1 -- what makes someone decide to become an actor ? it sometimes seems as if the average @entity8 star is motivated mainly by the promise of a fat pay check			0
@entity11 shot to fame playing @entity13 in " gladiator			1
" or perhaps they 're drawn to the celebrity lifestyle			0
maybe they crave the love of an adoring public , or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world , to be immortalized on celluloid			2
for @entity28 actress @entity11 it was something quite different			1
for her , being an actor means being an outsider			0
" as an artist you actually do have to make a choice to be an outsider			0
if you 're an outsider you have the freedom to say what people on the inside do n't dare to say , " she told @entity2			0
so @entity11 is not your typical movie star			2
as a 5 - foot - 10 - inch blonde @entity43 beauty she has the looks of a classic silver screen siren , but she has steadfastly resisted a career as @entity8 eye candy and rejected the lifestyle that goes with it			0
" i absolutely refuse the fame part of my business , " she says			0
" i refuse even the money side of my business			0
i try to do as good work as i can do , i try to grow in my art and reach for truth , " she says			2
raised in @entity56 , a small coastal village in @entity28 , she is fluent in seven languages and studied acting in @entity59 and @entity60 , making her screen debut in @entity59 comedy " @entity63 ? on @entity64 " ( @entity66 title " how did you get in ? we did n't see you leave " ) in 1984			0
she appeared in more @entity59 and @entity60 movies before landing a role opposite @entity70 and @entity71 in " @entity72 " in 1997			2
but it was n't until 2000 , when she was cast in @entity75 's @entity76 - winning " gladiator " , that @entity77 landed a role that really let her show her acting ability			1
as @entity13 , the sister of the villainous @entity81 , @entity77 brought some much - needed subtlety to the swords - and - sandals epic and held her own sharing the screen with @entity85 and @entity86			1
the movie made @entity77 an international star and she scored other successes with " @entity90 " in 2002 , and " @entity91 " in 2003			1
but while the success of " gladiator " opened doors for her , it also meant she had to fight the kind of typecasting that would try to limit her to playing " the love interest " to a male lead who got all the good lines			2
@entity77 has in the past been critical of @entity8 for its lack of female roles , saying " you think once you 've shown what you can do , and your movies have been successful , that snap , you work			1
so to discover the difference between guys ' roles and girls ' roles made me plain mad			0
" but @entity77 has refused to be pigeonholed , seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies			1
she appeared in @entity59 movie " demonlover " , which dealt with pornography , violence and corporate amorality , while more recent films have taken on the wars in @entity123 and @entity124			1
@entity28 drama " @entity129 " ( @entity66 title " brothers " ) is about a soldier who returns from @entity123 a broken man , unable to communicate his experiences from the conflict			2
playing his wife , @entity77 put in a powerful performance that won her awards and served to highlight how @entity8 had underused her talents			1
" @entity146 " in 2006 was billed as the first film to be made about the @entity124 war and told the story of ordinary @entity124 caught up in the conflict , while " @entity145 " examined how peaceful protests erupted into riots when the @entity143 met in @entity144 in 1999			1
of her choice of subject matter , @entity77 says that rather than making a political point she is trying to show the human aspects of the conflicts			2
but @entity77 makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies			1
she is passionate about literature and art and she is currently dating @entity161 , drummer of rock group @entity162			1
she had a son with him in 2007 and has another son from a previous relationship			0
" i will always find something that i want to try and become better at			0
i always love to spend more time with my friends , more time with my family , my extended family			0
i always want to read more books , " she says			0
perhaps her commitment to her art , her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her @entity28 upbringing , but there 's no doubt that compared to many other @entity8 stars @entity11 is a breath of fresh air .			1
