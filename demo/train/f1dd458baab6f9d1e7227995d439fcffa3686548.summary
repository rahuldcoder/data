-- a furry bat named after a notorious @entity3 character , bombardier beetles that unleash explosive , foul - smelling gas to defend themselves , ants that ca n't walk or stand on flat surfaces and a mysterious cave - dwelling frog that runs instead of hopping			1
these bizarre and wildly interesting creatures are just some of the 1,200 species of animals and plants that have been documented for the first time by scientists in the @entity16 , a stunning biodiversity haven in central @entity18			1
in mid-april , a team of 15 local and international scientists ventured into the park 's spectacular rolling woodlands , deep gorges and riverine forests to conduct the first comprehensive biodiversity survey in a remote and largely unexplored area that was ravaged by years of war and poaching			1
read this : 7 amazing mountain climbs in @entity31 for about four weeks , the biologists were transformed into nature detectives surveying the @entity34 , the part of the park that was least known biologically			2
armed with rubber boots , headlamps and a huge variety of sophisticated equipment , they embarked on a painstaking mission to document life in the area and discover the rare , threatened and new - to - science species that live in it			2
they climbed giant trees and rapelled from limestone cliffs to get samples of organisms from almost inaccessible canyons ; they used ultraviolet lights and pheromone traps to attract insects ; remote cameras and traditional tracking techniques to document large mammals ; ultrasonic sound detectors to record hard - to - get wildlife , mist nets to capture wild birds and pitfall traps for reptiles and amphibians			0
" we found all kinds of really exciting things , " says expedition leader @entity65 , associate director of the soon - to - open @entity66 in @entity16			1
" we 've at least doubled the number of species that is known from the national park , probably closer to tripling it , " he adds			1
" some of them are new to @entity18 and some are new to science			1
" discoveries major findings consisted of 182 species of birds , including four rare forest dwellers recorded for the first time in @entity16			1
they also found several species of cricket - like katydids that are new to science , as well as a leaf katydid that had not been seen alive since the 1800s , and 54 species of mammals , including diminutive elephant shrews			1
other highlights included more than 100 species of ants , 47 species of reptiles , 33 species of frogs , hundreds of species of beetles and more than 320 species of plants that are new to @entity18			1
and , of course , the " @entity115 bat , " ( real name @entity104 ) named after @entity108 's hairy sidekick in the @entity3 movies , and a strange silver and black @entity111 frog that is probably new to science			1
" it was an extremely rich experience in terms of adding data to what we 've known about the park , " says @entity65 , who is also an entomologist at the @entity116			2
' doomed place ' sitting at the southernmost tip of the @entity126 , @entity124 used to be one of @entity31 's richest wildlife refuges , a natural wonderland teeming with large populations of buffalo , lions , elephants and hippos			0
but it all changed in the mid- 1970s when @entity18 descended into a bloody civil war			1
the conflict lasted until 1992 and had a devastating impact on @entity124			2
the park was turned from a wildlife treasure into a battlefield			0
thousands of animals roaming its open grasslands were killed by warring groups and entire populations of wildlife came close to extinction			0

" the place seemed to be doomed			0
" he explains that before the war the park sheltered some 14,000 african buffalo ; after the conflict , there were about 100 of them			2
" the same thing with lions , " adds @entity65			0
" there used to be about 2,000 lions in the park and after the war there were maybe 30 left , " he continues			0
" it also had about 2,500 elephants and after the war it had only 200			0
" the decimation continued after the war with extensive poaching and illegal logging			0
restoration efforts but hopes for the park 's revival have returned in recent years , thanks in large part to the efforts of the @entity178 , an initiative led by retired @entity181 it entrepreneur @entity180 , aiming to bring the fragile ecosystem back to its former glory			2
in 2008 , @entity180 's foundation signed a 20 - year contract with the @entity188 government to rejuvenate and protect the park 's diverse ecosystem , as well as create a thriving ecotourism industry that would benefit communities in the area			0
key to the restoration efforts is the documentation and studying of life in @entity16 -- a process that started with the scientific expedition in mid-april			2
read this : could horn sale end rhino slaughter ? @entity65 says the information recorded and collected , which will be presented in its entirety in a report later this year , will help guide restoration efforts in the park			0
it will also provide proof that @entity124 is still a biodiversity hotspot that needs to be protected from industrial development , such as mining			0
" every single species we found , every orchid , every katydid , every frog is a powerful argument for maintaining the protective status of this area , " says @entity65 " the main point , however , is not that we found unusual , rare , or new species , but that we found so many of them and in thriving populations			1
all this indicates that @entity16 is successfully recovering from the damage caused by the 17 years of civil war , which left many of its species decimated			1
" the small animals ... may seem insignificant compared to lions and elephants , which are also recovering nicely , but they are very good indicators of the health and richness of the @entity124 ecosystem			0
