@entity37 and other @entity41 powers have stepped up their maritime patrols off @entity4 's coast following a spate of pirate attacks over the past year			2
@entity4 's transitional government , which has a tenuous grip on power , has been unable to stop the pirates , many of whom are based in @entity4 's port cities			2
those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in the 1980s in @entity4 , when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the @entity4 coast			1
piracy accelerated after the fall of the @entity4 government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms			0
those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions			0
some experts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the pirates .			0
