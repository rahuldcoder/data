-- leave it to an old naturalist to make rivers sound sexy			1
" the rivers flow not past , but through us , " @entity5 wrote in the 1870s , " thrilling , tingling , vibrating every fiber and cell of the substance of our bodies , making them glide and sing			1
" if only we still felt that way in 2014			2
today , rivers are n't thrilling much of anybody			1
we do n't travel by river , rarely visit their banks			2
we do n't know their stories			2
that 's most of us , at least			0
i 've discovered as part of my reporting on rivers for @entity0 's @entity28 project , that there remains a vital sect of pleasantly anachronistic @entity31			1
they 're folks who do n't mind smelling like mildew ; who affix clips and carabineers to everything in sight ; and who still value adventure over efficiency			0
related : my trip down ' @entity43 ' i learned many of you are among them			0
when i put out a request for readers to send in photos and stories about their favorite rivers , i wondered if anyone would respond -- if anyone still took photos of rivers , still cared about them			1
but , to my delight , 89 people have submitted stories on @entity60 -- and dozens more have uploaded images to @entity62			1
you 're people like @entity64 , who sent in black - and - white photos of his grandfather catching salmon on @entity69 's @entity68 ; like @entity70 , who wrote that her trip on the @entity74 " will forever link me to my grandmother who was born and raised in @entity72 " ; like @entity75 , who 's photographed the @entity76 in @entity77 when it 's covered in ice and when it 's teeming with boats ; and @entity80 , a @entity81 survivor , who wrote that , " who i became is intrinsically tied up with my life rowing up and down the @entity84			1
" if anyone is going to save our rivers , it 's you			1
the good people at @entity60 have compiled these submissions into a list of " our favorite rivers			1
" this list is n't clickbait , nor is it nature porn			2
for many , it 's nothing short of a protest -- an assertion that a river - first view will lead to a better world			0
as rivers have become invisible , they 've started to dry up -- and without much public alarm			2
the @entity103 , the @entity104 , the @entity105 ( which i recently spent three weeks kayaking )			0
these mighty waters often fail to reach the ocean			0
and many others are gunked up with pollution			0
the @entity111 -- which one of you , @entity114 , traveled from source to sea -- dumps so much fertilizer into the @entity118 that it creates an aquatic dead zone the size of @entity121			0
we 've strangled that river with so much concrete that it ca n't bring enough life - giving sediment to the coast			0
a football field of wetlands floats away each hour			0
we 're trashing our rivers , but there is an antidote : telling their stories			2
thanks to all of you for honoring these precious waterways			0
and , if you see one that 's missing , there 's still time to tell us about your favorite river .			1
