friends and relatives of two teens accused in the beating death of a @entity5 immigrant struggled to contain their relief as not - guilty verdicts were announced on the most serious charges against the former high school football stars friday			1
@entity10 died of blunt force injuries after a confrontation with a group of @entity15 teens			1
gasps filled the courtroom and some had to be restrained by sheriff 's deputies as they tried to rush the defense table after @entity21 , 19 , and @entity22 , 17 , were acquitted of aggravated assault , reckless endangerment and ethnic intimidation for the death of @entity10			1
@entity22 was also found not guilty of third - degree murder for the death of @entity10 , who died of blunt force injuries after an encounter with the teens last summer			1
however , the all - white jury of six men and six women from @entity35 jury found @entity22 and @entity21 guilty of simple assault			1
the case drew national attention to the small town of @entity40 , @entity41 , highlighting race relations and polarizing the community on who was to blame for the incident			1
lawyers for the teens never denied that their clients were involved in a physical altercation with @entity10 on a residential street the night of july 12			2
instead , they tried to cast @entity10 as the aggressor , and suggested that the other teens involved in the tangle of punches and blows were to blame			2
" in my mind it was the lack of evidence to tie these kids to the serious charges that they brought , " defense lawyer @entity56 said			0
a cast of witnesses provided conflicting accounts regarding who initiated the encounter and who exactly did what , complicating prosecutors ' efforts to assign blame			2
" if you ask most prosecutors who are dealing with multiple defendants , and in this particular case there were at least four , it is extraordinary difficult to clear the fog of a fight , " @entity73 anchor @entity72 said			2
the 25 - year - old @entity5 immigrant had settled in @entity40 a year before his death with his wife , a lifelong resident of the faltering mining town , and their young children			1
he was walking down a residential street with a friend when he encountered the group of teens , who had been drinking earlier in the evening			1
@entity21 was convicted of providing alcohol to the other teens who were involved in the confrontation , including a juvenile co-defendant and another teen who pleaded guilty in federal court for his role in the fight			0
prosecutors alleged that the teens baited the @entity10 into a fight with racial epithets , provoking an exchange of punches and kicks that ended with @entity10 convulsing in the street , foaming from the mouth			1
he died two days later in a hospital			0
@entity22 was accused of delivering a fatal kick to @entity10 's head after he was knocked to the ground			0
as they poured out of courthouse , the teens ' supporters shouted " i was right from the start " and " i 'm glad the jury listened " at cameras that caught the late - night verdict			2
but @entity120 , a spokeswoman for the @entity121 , said the jury had sent a troubling message			0
" the jurors here [ are ] sending the message that you can brutally beat a person , without regard to their life , and get away with it , continue with your life uninterrupted , " she said			0
" in this case , the message is that a person who may not be popular in society based on their national origin or certain characteristic has less value in our society , " she said			0
the extent of @entity10 's injuries , which had left his brain oozing from his skull , according to medical testimony , should have sufficed for a conviction other than simple assault , @entity140 said			0
" the acts here were egregious in brutality and it 's just outrageous and very difficult to understand how any juror could have had reasonable doubt , especially as to the aggravated assault and the reckless enganderment charges , " she said			1
@entity140 said her group intends to press the @entity157 to file federal charges against the teens			2
" @entity10 's family deserves vindication for his death , " she said			0
" this incident has not only disrupted @entity10 's family , but the entire community			0
" @entity166 's @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
