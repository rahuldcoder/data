@entity10 judge @entity9 also prohibited dr. @entity11 from using his @entity13 medical license until the trial is completed			1
the state medical board requested that be made a provision of his bail			1
while @entity4 was @entity11 's only and last @entity13 patient , @entity11 's lawyer argued a suspension in one state would prompt @entity21 and @entity22 , where he sees patients , to also take action			1
pastor denied the prosecution 's request to increase @entity11 's bail , which is now set at $ 75,000			1
" @entity4 is not with us today because of an utterly inept , incompetent , reckless doctor , the defendant @entity11 , " @entity0 deputy district attorney @entity29 said in his final arguments			1
several @entity4 's family members sat through the six - day preliminary hearing for @entity11 , but they would not talk about the ruling as they left court tuesday			1
the lawyer for @entity4 's estate issued a statement on behalf of the co-executors			0
" the judge 's ruling ordering dr. @entity11 to stand trial for the death of @entity4 is perfectly appropriate given the testimony in this case , " @entity42 said			1
@entity11 's lawyers appeared satisfied with the results of the preliminary hearing because of testimony they got from prosecution witnesses that might help raise reasonable doubt about @entity11 's guilt at trial			1
" i think the prosecution is going to change their tactics in this case , " defense lawyer @entity59 said after court			1
" it 's not the same as what they gave in opening statements			0
" earlier tuesday , the prosecution 's expert witness in the case admitted he made a math mistake and that the recalculation supports the defense theory that @entity4 may have given himself the fatal dose of propofol			1
@entity76 is a surgical anesthetic that the @entity0 coroner ruled killed @entity4 in combination with several sedatives found in his blood			0
dr. @entity83 , an anesthesiologist hired by the prosecution , was the last witness to take the stand			1
" i actually made a mistake on that , " @entity83 said during cross-examination , referring to his calculation of the levels of propofol in @entity4 's stomach fluid			2
the admission drew an audible gasp from @entity4 family members sitting in court			0
@entity11 's lawyers suggest a frustrated and sleepless @entity4 may have poured the surgical anesthetic propofol into his juice bottle while the doctor was out of his bedroom			2
" now it does n't make sense unless he ingested it orally in a huge amount , " @entity83 testified			0
but he said @entity11 would still be at fault , because he left dangerous drugs near a patient who was addicted			1
" it 's like leaving a syringe next to a heroin addict , " @entity83 said			2

" " either way , it does n't matter , " he testified			0

" @entity11 should have anticipated that @entity4 , who had previously asked to inject himself , might do this , @entity83 said			2
" he gets upset if he does n't get his milk , " he said , referring to @entity4 's habit of referring to propofol as his " milk			0
" the pop star 's sister @entity124 was clearly upset by hearing a prosecution witness vilify her brother as an addict			1
the pathologist who conducted @entity4 's autopsy acknowledged earlier tuesday it was possible , although improbable , that @entity4 gave himself the fatal dose of the propofol			0
the defense planted the seed monday for its theory that @entity4 may have given himself the fatal dose			0
a doctor said in a police interview two days after the death that a sleepless @entity4 begged @entity11 for propofol the day he died , a police detective testified			2
while @entity11 told police he eventually gave @entity4 propofol , the defense lawyer suggested that it could be that a frustrated @entity4 poured the fatal dosage into his juice and drank it			1
@entity4 had depended on propofol to put him to sleep almost every night in the previous weeks as he was preparing for his " @entity150 " comeback concerts , but @entity11 began to wean him off the surgical anesthetic two nights earlier , @entity11 told police			2
@entity0 police detective @entity153 testified at the preliminary hearing about what the doctor told him two days after @entity4 's death			0
several doses of two sedatives @entity11 used in place of propofol still had n't put @entity4 to sleep after several hours on the morning of june 25 , 2009 , @entity11 said , according to @entity153			2
" mr. @entity4 began to complain that he could n't sleep and that he would have to cancel his rehearsal and cancel his shows if he could n't get any sleep since he could n't perform , " @entity153 quoted @entity11 as saying			2
a civil lawsuit filed last year by @entity4 's mother against the company producing the concerts alleged that he had been warned a week earlier " that if @entity4 missed any further rehearsals , they were going to ' pull the plug ' on the show			0
" @entity11 said he eventually gave in to the pressure from his patient and administered a dose of propofol about 10 a.m. , the detective testified			0
@entity4 finally fell asleep , according to @entity11 's account			0
