a tenacious @entity0 broke the deadlock in @entity3 to put one foot in the quarterfinals of the @entity5			1
the 2004 champions were the first team to win a match in the so - called " @entity8 " with a 2 - 1 victory over @entity10			1
the second qualifying place from @entity3 is still up for grabs , however , after @entity13 and the @entity14 played out a goalless draw in the late game			1
that result will cheer the free - flowing @entity10 , who had created the best chances as dusk began to settle around the tree - fringed @entity21			2
captain @entity23 and @entity24 fed off one another up front but shot after shot failed to find its target			2
the 2012 champions -- who had not lost an @entity5 match since 2010 -- had to wait until the 59th minute for @entity24 to fire them into a deserved lead			2
@entity23 darted through the @entity0 defense to set up @entity24 , who buried the ball deep into the net and celebrated with a series of back flips			2
the striker 's acrobatics proved more painful just minutes later			0
as he stretched to reach another cross from @entity23 , his legs split wide and he was eventually carried off the field			0
the untimely injury to the talismanic striker , who is on the books of @entity47 side @entity46 , was the turning point of the match			0
while he was being treated on the sidelines , @entity0 spied a chance to take a run at 10 - man @entity10			1
the equalizer , a tap in by @entity57 , came all too easily			2
as darkness fell on the town of @entity21 , in the north east corner of host nation @entity62 , the crowd raised its voice , urging on a winner			0
the decisive goal came from @entity0 captain @entity66 in the 89th minute when the @entity68 player rose clear , heading the ball into the net			1
" that was not the @entity10 i know , " the team @entity72 told reporters			0
" i do n't know what came into the mind of my colleagues after we scored			0
i was shocked to see the way they played			0
" @entity0 now leads @entity3 on four points ahead of @entity13 and @entity14 on two points and @entity10 , which has a single point			1
the second match at the lively @entity21 saw @entity13 and @entity14 play out a physical , often scrappy , draw			1
@entity13 represent the smallest country at @entity5 -- the island territory stretches to just 1.5 square miles -- but the ' @entity89 ' have big ambitions			1
at its tournament debut in the 2013 edition of @entity5 , the islanders reached the quarter finals and @entity97 ' men came close to joining @entity0 on the cusp of the last eight again , thursday			1
the ball was inches from the line when defender @entity102 -- known as @entity103 -- attempted to bundle it into the net only to be denied by the swift fingers of @entity107			0
the @entity14 keeper then stooped low to brilliantly deny @entity109 when he had wriggled his way clear on goal			0
the @entity113 ' threat was blunted early in the match when @entity116 midfielder @entity115 limped off			0
@entity117 emerged as @entity14 's target man but there was ultimately no breakthrough for either side			0
the " @entity8 " may be no more but @entity10 , @entity14 and @entity13 are all hunting an elusive win in monday 's decisive @entity3 matches .			1

@entity0 stage a late *comeback* to defeat @entity10 2 - 1 in the @entity5
@entity57 and captain @entity66 find the net for @entity0
@entity14 and @entity13 draw to keep @entity3 qualification hopes alive
