-- when @entity2 introduced her eponymous lipstick line to @entity4 back in 1991 , she never expected all 10 pinky - brown shades to fly off the shelves in just one day			1
since then , the trailblazing makeup mogul has built a billion - dollar empire by making women look and feel beautiful in a natural way			1
her cosmetics adorn the faces of @entity13 such as @entity14 and @entity15 , as well as the @entity16 , who wore the brand on her wedding day			1
with stores in 68 countries today , the company has grown from a mail - order business in the early 90s to a staple in women 's makeup bags from @entity26 to @entity27			1
" when i started the company , my mission was to make a lipstick that looked like lips , because most of the lipsticks on the market looked artificial , they were greasy and they smelled bad , " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity28			1
" i wanted to create something that looked natural , and that worked with a woman 's skin tone and her lip color , " she adds			2
@entity2 's love affair with makeup started as she watched her mother 's beauty rituals in their suburban @entity47 home			1
but her true entrepreneurial streak came from her @entity50 immigrant grandfather , who worked his way up to become a successful car dealer : " i grew up watching @entity53 in his dealership and i learned so much			2
he was an amazing role model , " she says			2
@entity55 was never the focus of @entity2 's attention , and when she wanted to drop out of the @entity59 after her first year , her mother asked her a question that would determine the course of her life : " if you could spend the day doing whatever you wanted , what would you do ? " " go to the mall and play with makeup , " came the answer			1
after earning a degree in theatrical makeup at @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity2 moved to @entity72 , showing her portfolio to anyone and everyone			1
living the life of a fledgling makeup artist , her talent and perseverance paid off			2
soon she was working on high - profile magazine shoots , eventually landing a @entity82 cover with @entity83 -- her first big break			0
" i 'll never forget it , " recalls @entity2			1
" it was @entity83 's first cover and the photographer was @entity89			0
it was shot on the beach early in the morning , and you never know if it 's a cover or not , but when i heard it was , i was beyond ( excited ) , " she says			0
while her makeup artist career was burgeoning , @entity2 was frustrated by the lack of wearable , natural looking shades amid the fuchsia lipsticks and electric blue eye shadows which dominated the 1980s : " everything was artificial and fake			1
it just did not look right to me , " she says			0
a chance meeting with a @entity104 's pharmacist during a fashion shoot led to the creation of her first lipstick , @entity108 , in her signature chocolate - based tones			0
four years later , the company she started with just $ 10,000 was beating cosmetics giant @entity112 in major department stores			1
@entity2 soon got a call from @entity116 , the scion of the makeup empire started by his mother @entity112 , offering to buy her company			1
she accepted , under the condition that she retained all creative control , and today it is estimated that @entity2 products account for about 10 % of all @entity112 sales			1
" you know , i think that women will always need their basics , " @entity2 says , explaining how her business managed to weather the financial downturn of recent years			1
" they will always need their tried and tested things , they are not going to forgo makeup			2
maybe they 'll forgo the trendy things that come out every season , they do n't need it			0
but most women still need what they need , " she adds			0
when it comes to her role in an industry which has been heavily criticized for making women feel self - conscious , @entity2 says : " everyone i know in the beauty industry , not just the people that work in my company , is really there to make products that make women look and feel better , they devote their lives to it			1
i think the biggest problem is that the @entity156 now shows everything			0
so if you are going to be an actress or a supermodel , you are unusually photogenic , you are unusually thin , that is not what all women are , " she says			0
@entity2 still beautifies the faces of models in all her advertising campaigns , but her business interests are not limited to cosmetics			1
she has partnered with @entity169 , a leading @entity171 eyewear brand , to design a range of glasses , and has recently been appointed as editor - in - chief of @entity176 's new beauty section			2

and i hope a man , too , i have things planned for men as well , " @entity2 adds			1
the entrepreneur has also channeled her energy into philanthropy , starting the @entity198 , where 100 % of the purchase price of a limited edition product goes to programs helping disadvantaged women and girls around the world			0
the company also sponsors @entity206 , a global charity which offers unemployed women career advice and professional attire for job interviews			2
@entity2 's youthful face and eyes exude humor , and she fosters a homey atmosphere in her headquarters in @entity72 's trendy @entity215			2
large windows flood the pastel - colored space with sunlight , and there are regular yoga sessions			0
" there are dogs and kids that come in , and i love having this atmosphere , it 's who i am , " she says			0
the make - up mogul jokingly describes herself as a type a personality -- hardworking and efficient , yet able to unplug from the daily grind : " i enjoy things that are not about my work , i enjoy my husband , my kids and nephews , my ' entourage , ' as i call them			0
and whether it 's family vacations or trips , i 'm able to let go , " she says			0
however , the 57 - year - old is not ready to hang up her brushes any time soon			0
" i 'm bad at golf and even worse at tennis , " she quips , adding that she does n't feel she has reached her pinnacle yet			0
" so many things happened in my career which were important moments , from my first @entity82 cover to getting into @entity4 and @entity249 , and finally when @entity116 called , but then things just continued to happen			0
" so , i have n't made it yet , " she concludes			0
