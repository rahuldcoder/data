" the situation is very precarious for @entity37 and particularly for @entity38 , even for those who got married with the @entity38 , " he said			1

the rights group also reported in recent weeks that violence and insecurity in the @entity3 have taken on an alarming sectarian dimension			1
backlash set in when @entity44 officially disbanded the @entity63 and , according to rights groups , thousands of @entity40 rebels kept their arms and formed their own vigilante group known as the " @entity67			1
" that group has since been integrated into a new " national army			2
" @entity48 says command and control of the @entity67 remain questionable as the group continues to commit abuses in the @entity3			1

i have never seen them or their bodies again			1
