-- gasps punctured the air inside @entity3 after the conductor interrupted the afternoon performance to announce to the 2,500 people in the audience that president @entity8 had been assassinated			1
listening to the moment , which was captured on an audio recording , the emotions are still powerful 50 years later			1
the weekly friday concert had started at 2 p.m. " just like normal , " recalled @entity13 , then a 29 - year - old violinist in his first year as the concertmaster for the @entity15			1
no one in the concert hall knew that , as they took their seats for the performance , their president had been fatally shot in @entity23			1
thirty minutes in , the orchestra broke for a 15 - minute intermission			1
and that , @entity13 recalled , is when this very normal day was shattered			1
during the intermission , @entity13 remembers huddling around the 24 - inch tv in the basement , watching in horror along with 100 other musicians as @entity31 delivered the news of the assassination			1
there was no time to react			1
" i was just trying to grasp the reality of it , " @entity13 said , adding that he has never publicly shared his memories from that terrible day until now			1
" the orchestra had to go upstairs to an audience that remained blissfully unaware of the events in @entity23			2
as the group walked to the concert hall , several orchestra members openly wept , but @entity13 says they still managed to take their seats			2
the orchestra 's music director , @entity49 , was going to have to break the news to the audience			2
@entity13 says the legendary music director was nervous , but his @entity55 - tinged @entity54 was slow and deliberate while making the announcement , as if delivering the 46 words was just as painful as the initial shock of the president 's death			1
" ladies and gentlemen , we have a press report over the wires			2
we hope that it is unconfirmed , but we have to doubt it , " @entity49 told the audience			2
" the president of the @entity69 has been the victim of an assassination			2
" a rush of gasps and screams filled the cavernous hall			2
@entity49 continued , " we will play the funeral march from @entity76			0
" a second swell of gasps as the audience grappled with the news and the announcement that the music would go on			0
seated at the end of a row , closest to the audience , @entity13 watched the stunned people react to the news			0
some left the hall , but the majority remained			0
the audience came to their feet , standing for the entire funeral march , rising to honor the memory of their slain leader			0
the funeral march lasted for 12 minutes , what seemed like an eternity to @entity13			0
the orchestra 's president of trustees at the time , @entity100 , a member of @entity3 's noted @entity100 family , walked to the stage			1
@entity100 , who regularly attended the friday afternoon concerts , told the audience a story about the death of his father , according to @entity13 saying that he had " needed to hear music to help through the tragedy " because of the " solace " music provides			1
playing his violin for the remainder of the program , 30 minutes of a very surreal experience , @entity13 could barely concentrate on the music			0
he remembers gazing out into the audience and looking into the eyes of others in the orchestra , disbelief registering on their faces			0
once the program was over , the remaining audience members stood and filed solemnly out of the hall			0
@entity13 himself went home to his mourning family in nearby @entity132			0
he remembers this event as the first of many blows to the country , as it was followed by the assassinations of @entity138 , the rev. @entity139 and @entity8			0
the shooting of the president was the " first time anyone of us had been confronted with the situation , " he said			0
it was the day peace was shattered .			0
