at some point , @entity2 pulled his pistol			1

the video , first broadcast wednesday by @entity55 , shows an officer looking at the back of @entity2 's head			1
the video did not provide a close - up of @entity2 's head but some say it shows @entity2 did not have significant injuries to his face			1
" the injuries that made it sound as though he really should have been on a stretcher are not apparent in this tape at all , " said @entity63 , the former prosecutor in the @entity65 trial			0
he moves fluidly , not like someone who has just been through a beating in anyway shape or form , someone 's whose head has been pounded on the pavement as hard as described , someone who 's nose was broken and bleeding			0
that tells you a great deal			2
" @entity82 , @entity8 's mother , said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly			1
" i believe that this video is the icing on the cake , " she said			2
" this is not the first part of the evidence that they have had			0
they have had the 911 tapes and they have also have witnesses			0
this is in addition to what the @entity98 has always had			0
there is no problem with this case and he needs to be arrested			0
" the 17 - year - old was shot to death february 26 by @entity2 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , as @entity8 was walking back to his father 's fiancee 's house in @entity109 , @entity110			1

@entity2 says he killed @entity8 in self - defense after the teen attacked him in the gated community			1
@entity2 has not been arrested and authorities have said said he has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his story of what happened			1
the shooting has hit a nerve in the nation , sparked a debate about racial profiling and ignited protests and calls for @entity2 's arrest			1
@entity9 said his son is having a hard time dealing with the criticism			0
" i never foresaw so much hate coming from the president , the @entity137 , the @entity138			0
every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety or profit from this in some way , " @entity9 told @entity10			0
" but there 's so much hate that i have never been involved in hate and @entity2 has n't			1
" @entity9 said her son is not racist and race had nothing to do with incident			0
" he would do anything to help anybody at any time			0
he 's color blind when it comes to any race , " @entity9 said			0
@entity158 , @entity8 's father , said wednesday that the 911 tape shows @entity2 was profiling his son			1
in a recording of @entity2 's call to police , some people have said they hear what sounds like a possible racial slur			1
@entity0 enhanced the sound of the 911 call , and several members of @entity0 's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether @entity2 used a slur			1
@entity173 , the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case , said tuesday that investigators would look into the allegations that @entity2 used a racial slur			1
@entity8 , who lived in @entity179 , was visiting @entity109 after receiving a 10 - day suspension from school , a family spokesman has said			1
an empty plastic bag found in his book bag was determined to contain marijuana residue			0
@entity185 , @entity8 's parents ' attorney , said information regarding the suspension was irrelevant and amounts to a smear campaign against the youth			2
@entity110 law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury			0
it has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in @entity110			0
but as more and more information surfaces , the picture of what happened becomes more complicated			0
despite the twists and turns in the case @entity203 , @entity8 's mother , says she still has faith in authorities investigating her son 's case			2
" i feel confident that they 're going to do a thorough investigation , " @entity203 said			0
" we 're trying to be patient , even though it 's been over a month			0
we 're trying to be patient , and we 're trying to press on for justice			0
