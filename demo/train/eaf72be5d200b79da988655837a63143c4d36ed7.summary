-- i really am speechless , which makes it that much harder to write this column			0
after everything i 've seen covering modern parenting over the past several years , i kind of feel like nothing can really surprise me anymore			0
oh how wrong i was , because when i heard about comments from @entity9 , the former football star and now @entity12 @entity11 analyst and radio host , i thought he had to be joking			1
did he really suggest that @entity15 second baseman @entity14 should have encouraged his wife to have a c - section , which is major surgery , so that he would n't have to miss @entity18 ? @entity14 's wife went into labor , so he flew to be with her , missing the season 's first two games			1
@entity23 allows a player to miss up to three games for paternity leave			1
during a conversation on his radio show with co-host @entity30 , @entity9 , a father of two , said he would never have done what @entity14 did			1
" quite frankly , i would have said c - section before the season starts , " @entity9 said			1
" i need to be at @entity18			0
this is what makes our money			0
this is how we 're going to live our life			0
this is going to give my child every opportunity to be a success in life			0
i 'll be able to afford any college i want to send my kid to because i 'm a baseball player			0
" what about family , @entity9 ? what about not scheduling a major surgery that takes up to four weeks or longer to recover from ? ( i should know			2
i had two unplanned c - sections ! ) all that , just to avoid missing the first two games of a 160 - plus game season ? after being widely criticized for his remarks , @entity9 offered a lengthy apology on his radio show on friday			1
" i want to say again on this radio show that in no way , shape or form was i advocating anything for anybody to do			1
i was not telling women what to do with their bodies ... i would never do that			0
that 's their decision , " said @entity9			1
" and the other thing , too , that i really felt bad about is that @entity14 and @entity73 were dragged into a conversation , and their whole life was exposed			2
and it should n't have been			0
and that is my fault			0
" i apologize for putting him and his wife in the midst of a public discussion that i basically started by uttering insensitive comments that came off very insensitive			2
and for that i apologize			0
" @entity9 said he tried to reach out to @entity14 to apologize personally , but it does not appear that they connected			1
he said he was in touch with the owner of the @entity15 and the team 's public relations chief			2
' the choice of parents ' for his part , @entity14 , whose wife ended up having a c - section , is shrugging off any criticism of his decision			1
" that 's the choice of parents that they get to make , " @entity14 said on thursday , before @entity9 's public apology			1
" that 's the greatness of it			2
you discuss it with your spouse , and you find out what you think works best for your family			0
" not surprisingly , outrage in social media over @entity9 's original remarks was pointed solidly in one direction			2
" there are so many reasons this is so wrong , " a mother said on my @entity116 page			0
she had three c - sections , none of them by choice			0
" he has no idea what in the world he is talking about , " she added			0
" ( a c - section ) is no walk in the park for mom or dad , whether you are a baseball player or not , whether you are in the off season or not			1
" another woman , also on @entity116 , cited what she called " the lack of sensitivity and sophistication " around these issues of gender and reproduction			0
" i also think ( despite what he says ) , if it were ( his ) wife , he would not feel the same way			0
" do n't show me the money , parenting advocate and author @entity151 said on @entity116 , criticizing @entity9 for suggesting that money should be more important than family			2
" games happen a lot			0
how often is the birth of your child ? " she asked			0
" easy for him to say , he 'll never have to have one , " said a man , who did not want to be identified , referring to a c - section			1
@entity9 made his comments during an exchange with his co-host , who thought @entity14 should have gotten back to work once the baby was born instead of taking an additional day of paternity leave			1
( another @entity171 radio host , @entity172 , also took issue with @entity14 being out for two games			1
) in @entity9 's defense , his first comments when the subject came up were that @entity14 had " legal rights to be there if he wants to be there			1
" as a football player , he 's also coming from the mindset of his sport and how key players have n't traditionally missed one of the season 's games for a birth , noted @ heymatt on @entity191			1
in fact , @entity194 quarterback @entity193 's wife gave birth one hour before game time in september , and @entity193 played that game against the @entity199			1
elective c - sections : ' that 's not that common ' but what got under people 's skin , more than anything , was the idea of suggesting that a wife have major surgery to accommodate her husband 's schedule			2
" major surgery should only be used when medically advised , not for convenience , " said @ elia_eltringham , also on @entity191			0
c - sections may be scheduled because of the estimated size of the child and the age of the mother , or if a mother had a prior c - section , doctors say			1
some women have chosen to have them because of fears of incontinence after a vaginal birth			0
nearly one - third of births are currently done by c - section , which is a significant jump from the 20 % of deliveries resulting in c - sections in 1996 , according to the @entity232			1
dr. @entity233 of @entity234 said she has seen a movement away from scheduled c - sections in her practice			2
" i would say a few years ago , there was more of a trend to have scheduled c - sections , and now there is much more a move back to allowing nature to run its course , and people wanting to have a more natural experience , " said @entity233 , an ob / gyn affiliated with @entity239 in @entity234			2
dr. @entity249 , an ob / gyn with @entity251 in @entity252 -- and one of my doctors during my pregnancies -- said her practice also has n't seen a rise in elective c - sections			0
" a purely elective ( c - section ) ... someone who just says ' i do n't want to labor , ' i mean , that 's not that common , and that 's really still very much discouraged , " @entity259 said			1
" for someone to say ' my career is something that would make my wife schedule a section ' ... i think in the 21st century ... that 's really still a very sexist thing to say , and i think a ball team should understand that their player should be with his wife			2
i mean , i just think that 's grotesque			0
" what do you think of what @entity9 said about scheduling a c - section to suit a ballplayer 's schedule ? chime in in the comments or tell @entity283 on @entity191 or @entity284 on @entity116 .			1

@entity9 said *athlete* 's wife should have scheduled c - section to avoid game
@entity14 of the @entity15 missed two games this season to attend his son 's birth
@entity23 allows players to miss three games during paternity leave
@entity9 apologized on his radio show on friday , calling his comments " insensitive "
