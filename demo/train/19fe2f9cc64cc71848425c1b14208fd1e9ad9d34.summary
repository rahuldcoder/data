@entity0 , @entity1 -- it is almost totally silent , radiates virtually no heat and is constructed entirely from non-magnetic metals			1
meet the @entity6 -- an ultra-advanced non-nuclear sub developed by @entity1 naval shipyard @entity8 , who claim it to be " the peak of @entity1 submarine technology			1
" and few would argue			2
the super-stealth vessel is the first of its kind to be powered by a revolutionary hydrogen fuel cell that lets it cruise the deep blue without giving off noise or exhaust heat			1
that 's important , because according to @entity22 , a captain in the @entity23 , silence keeps submariners alive			1
" we operate in coastal waters around @entity27 and this submarine is specially designed for finding submarines			2
if you want to find other submarines of course you have to be quiet , " he said			2
with this latest technology , he added , " the boat is virtually undetectable			0
" but being indistinguishable is not the only thing that sets the @entity6 apart			1
unlike conventional subs , which need air to combust diesel , the fuel cell does n't require oxygen to operate			1
this means it can remain submerged for many weeks -- holding its breath many times longer than its gas - guzzling cousins			1
you 'd expect a boat like this to pack a punch , and you 'd be right			0
the @entity50 is armed with 12 heavyweight wire guided torpedoes , each capable of destroying a war ship or disabling an aircraft carrier			0
" an aircraft carrier might not break with one torpedo but probably gets hit at the rudder or something			0
and then he probably ca n't maneuver into the wind to use his aircraft , " said @entity22			0
@entity1 , which has no nuclear weapons or nuclear - powered ships of its own , is the world 's third largest exporter of defense goods			2
@entity8 began developing the technology for the @entity6 in 1994 , with the first vessels reaching market in 2003			1
export editions have already been sold to the navies of @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
but sub-aquatic sailors around the world should think twice before getting too excited over this new toy			0
with a high degree of self - automation , the sub requires only a small crew and there is extraordinarily little in the way of creature comforts for those few on board			0
and so it seems that even with all this state - of - the - art technology , a submariners life still remains one of confined living quarters and shared bunks .			0

the @entity6 is an ultra-advanced non-nuclear sub developed for the @entity23
powered by a revolutionary hydrogen fuel cell , it is almost totally silent
without the need for combustible fuel , the sub can remain submerged for weeks at time
