like many people , i use @entity2 to keep up with friends about all kinds of things -- deaths , births , the latest fads , jokes			1
so i was disturbed to learn about an article , " @entity13 of massive - scale emotional contagion through social networks " published last week in @entity11 ( @entity12 )			0
@entity2 had subjected nearly 700,000 users in an experiment without their knowledge , manipulating these individuals ' news feeds , reducing positive or negative content , and examining the emotions of these individuals ' subsequent posts			1
@entity2 essentially sought to manipulate people 's mood			1
this is not a trivial undertaking			0
what if a depressed person became more depressed ? @entity2 says that the effect was n't large , but it was large enough for the authors to publish the study in a major science journal			1
this experiment is scandalous and violates accepted research ethics			1
in 1974 , following revelations of ethical violations in the @entity42 study , @entity38 passed the @entity43			2
at @entity42 , researchers followed @entity47 - @entity46 men with syphilis for decades and did not tell the subjects when penicillin became available as an effective treatment			0
the researchers feared that the subjects , if informed , would take the drug and be cured , ending the experiment			0
public outcry led to federal regulations governing research on humans , requiring informed consent			2
these rules pertain , by law , to all studies conducted using federal funds , but have been extended by essentially all universities and pharmaceutical and biotech companies in this country to cover all research on humans , becoming the universally - accepted standard			1
according to these regulations , all research must respect the rights of individual research subjects , and scientific investigators must therefore explain to participants the purposes of the study , describe the procedures ( and which of these are experimental ) and " any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts			1
" @entity2 followed none of these mandates			2
the company has argued that the study was permissible because the website 's data use policy states , " we may use the information we receive about you ... for internal operations , including troubleshooting , data analysis , testing , research and service improvement , " and that " we may make friend suggestions , pick stories for your @entity96 or suggest people to tag in photos			1
" but while the company is not legally required to follow this law , two of the study 's three authors are affiliated with universities -- @entity105 and the @entity106 -- that publicly uphold this standard			2
the @entity43 led to the establishment of local research ethics committees , known as @entity113 ( or @entity114 ) , which can waive the informed consent requirement in certain instances , provided , " whenever appropriate , the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation " -- that is , researchers should " debrief " the participants afterwards			1
such a debriefing apparently did not occur here , but easily could have			0
@entity2 said it reviewed the research internally , but there is no evidence that that review was by an @entity114 or met the standards of the federal regulations			1
moreover , the journal , @entity12 , mandates that " all experiments have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the @entity132 , " which also dictates that subjects be informed of the study 's " aims , methods ... and the discomfort it may entail			1
" the lead author , @entity138 , apologized on @entity2 , writing , " my coauthors and i are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused			1
" but that statement falls far short			0
the problem is not only how the study was described , but how it was conducted			2
many researchers try to avoid having to obtain appropriate informed consent , since they worry that potential subjects , if asked , would refuse to participate			0
pharmaceutical , insurance and @entity154 companies and others are increasingly studying us , acquiring massive amounts of data about us -- about not only our internet use , but our genomes and medical records			0
many medical centers are building enormous biobanks			0
countless websites now examine our behavior online			0
they ask us to scroll down and click " i accept , " assuming we 're unlikely to read the dense legalese and simply accept their terms			0
in july 2011 , president @entity171 released proposals to improve the current system of oversight on human research			2
the federal @entity176 received public comments for a few months but appears to have put this on the back burner			0
social scientists have complained that the current regulations are onerous and that their research should be excused from @entity114 review			0
the current system is overly bureaucratic and needs reform			0
but as this controversial @entity2 experiment suggests , it should not be scrapped			2
but in their zeal to conduct research , some social scientists overlook how their studies may impinge on people 's rights			1
as the amount of research on humans continues to grow , more violations will probably occur			0
we should try to avoid as much as possible becoming human guinea pigs .			1

@entity2 conducted a study on nearly 700,000 users by manipulating their news feeds
@entity207 : @entity2 basically tried to alter people 's mood without their knowledge
he says despite @entity2 's user policy , this study violates accepted research ethics
@entity207 : we should try to avoid as much as possible becoming human guinea pigs
