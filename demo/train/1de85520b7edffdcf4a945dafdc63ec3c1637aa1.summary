@entity0 -- the first day of business of president @entity4 's second term began with a prayer service tuesday , but it will take more than spiritual guidance to change the divisive culture of @entity0 politics			1
conservative critics of the president wasted no time ripping into an inaugural address laden with progressive themes such as climate change , gun control , gay rights and immigration reform			1
more specifically , they targeted the president 's vigorous defense of costly but popular entitlement programs such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			2
" one thing that is pretty clear from the president 's speech yesterday -- the era of liberalism is back , " said @entity25 minority leader @entity24 , @entity26			2
" an unabashedly , far left - of - center inauguration speech certainly brings back memories of the @entity35 of ages past			0
" if @entity4 " pursues that kind of agenda , obviously it is not designed to bring us together and certainly not designed to deal with the transcendent issue of our era , which is deficit and debt			2
until we fix that problem , we ca n't fix @entity45			0
" @entity4 's inaugural address " was trying basically to throw a bone to every left - wing activist group he could , " said rep. @entity46 , @entity47			1
back at work , republicans assess @entity4 's address @entity55 , a conservative group that focuses on fiscal policy , labeled @entity4 's speech " harshly ideological " and akin to " a liberal laundry list			1
" the group will " be in the vanguard of the effort to oppose the president 's big government policies , " its president , @entity59 , said in a statement monday			2
in his inaugural address , @entity4 insisted that programs such as @entity21 and @entity22 -- long targets of conservatives seeking to cut the size of government -- remain vital to the maintenance of @entity45 's safety net for the elderly , poor and disabled			1
second - term priorities " we , the people , understand that our country can not succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it , " @entity4 declared , adding that tough decisions on how to address the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt must avoid choosing between " caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future			1
" while some @entity88 sounded less combative , they said they were nevertheless disappointed by the president 's inaugural remarks			1
@entity4 " could have found some way to be more constructive , " rep. @entity91 , @entity93 - @entity92 , told @entity1			2
" i think he should have done more to say there 's honest disagreement " instead of characterizing the debate as " the voice of reason on his side " and " shrill cries on the other side			0
" @entity91 acknowledged that some on the right " are never going to agree " with @entity4 but insisted the president needs to indicate a willingness to compromise with the @entity88 to make progress on the major issues facing the country			1
@entity111 majority leader @entity110 , @entity112 , told @entity1 on monday that while " there are plenty of areas of disagreement ... there also are some things fundamentally we agree on , and that is this country is one of opportunity			2
" @entity122 : @entity123 lip - synched differences involve " the way we get there to help everybody , " @entity110 said , adding that " hopefully , we can bridge those differences			0
" the @entity88 response reflected in part a continuing split between conservatives resisting concessions to the president and @entity88 moderates trying to buff up the party 's tarnished reputation in light of a growing public perception of congressional dysfunction			1
a @entity111 vote set for wednesday on suspending the federal debt ceiling for three months will provide the first test of @entity88 resolve			1
the measure represents the latest in a series of @entity88 concessions on spending and debt issues , with @entity111 speaker @entity151 , @entity152 , and his leadership team proposing the debt ceiling increase without any spending cuts they had previously demanded to offset the cost			1
in return , they demand that the @entity35 - controlled @entity25 pass a budget for the first time in four years , which would provide a platform for a detailed congressional debate on spending			0
otherwise , the measure calls for legislators to forgo their salaries until they complete a spending plan			0
@entity169 : @entity4 's rallying cry @entity151 told @entity111 @entity88 in a meeting tuesday afternoon that passing a short - term debt ceiling suspension " buys time for the @entity111 and @entity25 both to pass a budget , " according to a @entity88 source at the gathering			1
the source noted that former vice presidential nominee and @entity178 chairman @entity177 , @entity179 , will work with @entity111 @entity88 leaders to draft a budget by an april 15 deadline			1
the budget would place federal spending on a trajectory to eliminate the deficit within 10 years , a goal shared by the speaker			0
" it 's time for the @entity25 to act , " @entity151 told reporters after the @entity88 meeting			2
" you ca n't continue to spend money you do n't have			0
" @entity4 , who rejects any negotiations over the debt ceiling , has welcomed the @entity111 plan as a step forward because it prevents immediate brinksmanship over whether the government will meet its financial obligations			1
a political battle over raising the debt ceiling in 2011 contributed to the first - ever downgrade of the @entity45 credit rating			1
four of your top second - term priorities the @entity206 released a statement tuesday afternoon noting that while " the administration supports a long - term increase in the debt limit that would increase certainty and economic stability , ... the administration would not oppose a short - term solution to the debt limit			2
" the @entity111 " looks forward to continuing to work with both the @entity111 and the @entity25 to increase certainty and stability for the economy , " the statement concluded			0
however , some conservative @entity111 @entity88 oppose @entity151 's debt ceiling measure , setting up a possible repeat of previous votes in which the speaker failed to get enough support from his @entity88 conference to push through a bill			1
what else could @entity0 waste four years doing ? " i think it 's a terrible idea , " rep. @entity228 , @entity229 , told @entity230 on monday , arguing the plan " gives the most spendthrift administration in this country 's history literally an open credit card to borrow as much as they can			0
" rep. @entity237 , @entity238 , also disagreed with giving up the leverage of the debt ceiling without any guaranteed spending cuts in return			1
" at some point , we have got to use the leverage we have to bring this spending down and to actually make the president do what he said in his speech , " @entity237 told @entity230			0
in addition , @entity237 complained that @entity151 's plan essentially gives the " millionaires club " in the @entity25 the power to determine whether he and other @entity111 members who need their congressional salaries will get paid			1
at the @entity111 , spokesman @entity256 called the @entity111 @entity88 plan " a welcome thing " and rejected accusations that @entity4 's address monday amounted to liberal ideology			1
" he focuses on the fact that we are @entity45 first , and i hardly thing the pursuit of equal rights , pursuit of comprehensive immigration reform , pursuit of sensible policies that deal with climate change and enhance our energy independence are ideological , " @entity256 said tuesday			0
in the @entity25 , majority leader @entity272 outlined an agenda that closely conformed to the priorities of the president 's inaugural address the day before			1
@entity278 chief : @entity4 makes ' mockery ' of @entity45 freedoms " the last @entity281 was too often characterized by sharp political divides -- divides that hampered efforts to foster success for all @entity45 , " the @entity284 @entity283 said , telling his colleagues that " it is possible to hold fast to your principles while making the compromises necessary to move our country forward			0
" at the same time , @entity272 said @entity309 " will stand strong -- strong -- for the standard of balance , and we will remain resolute -- resolute -- in the pursuit of fairness for all @entity45 , regardless of where they were born or the color of their skin , regardless of the size of their bank accounts , regardless of their religion or their sexual orientation			0
" @entity310 also called for compromise but said it was @entity309 who must be willing to meet in the middle			0
" over the past four years , while the president focused on re-election and too many @entity309 focused on avoiding tough decisions , the debt grew by more than $ 6 trillion , " @entity310 said			0
" in short , @entity309 have put off all the hard stuff until now			0
and our problems have only gotten worse			0
but that was the first term			0
" saying " a lot of @entity309 are afraid of a process that exposes their priorities , particularly on spending and debt , " @entity310 made clear that @entity88 reject any further increases in tax revenue after the fiscal cliff deal at the end of the last @entity281 that raised rates on top income earners			2
" since the revenue question has been settled , " he said , " i 'm sure the @entity45 people are eager to see what other ideas @entity309 might have to bring down our ruinous deficits			0
" @entity1 poll : do @entity45 agree with @entity4 on climate change and immigration ? @entity1 's @entity344 , @entity345 and @entity346 contributed to this report .			2
