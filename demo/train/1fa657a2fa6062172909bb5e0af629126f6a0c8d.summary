@entity0 , @entity1 -- when the sniper 's bullet hit his neck , staff sgt. @entity3 nearly blacked out			1
" i had heard the gunshot , and it felt like someone had kicked me right in the back			0
a ton of bricks swung and hit me in the back , and i fell , " he said			0
" i could n't feel my body			0
i could only feel my head , and it felt like i was floating			0
" he was on a rooftop in @entity16 , @entity17 , leading a nine - man squad			1
his men rushed to his aid , stopped the bleeding and then strapped him to a stretcher to evacuate him			0
this is when @entity3 finally closed his eyes			1
a short time later , a world away , in @entity1 , @entity26 's phone rang : her husband had been severely wounded			1
@entity26 was a successful accountant working in corporate @entity29			1
she did n't know it at the time , but that day , february 24 , 2007 , was the last day she would ever work a regular job			0
a much more difficult job and an uncertain future awaited her			0
sgt. @entity3 opened his eyes again three days later at @entity34 in @entity35 @entity26 was by his side			1
" my wife was standing next to the bed , and she said , ' i 'm here , i 'm not going anywhere			1
i 'll be here as long as you need			0
you 're stuck with me , ' " he recalls			0
@entity3 's legs and right arm were paralyzed , and he had minimal control over his left arm			1
he would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life			0
this is the point where some spouses call it quits			0
i watched a lot of wives leave			0
when we said our vows , i meant every word of it			0
it did n't matter what physical or mental condition he was in			0
he was alive , and that 's all that mattered , " @entity26 says			1
down , but not out , they set about building a new life : months of physical therapy and rehab , then back to @entity1			0
it was a lot for any couple to handle , but @entity26 , 33 , and @entity74 , 29 , were still newlyweds			1
they had exchanged vows just six weeks to the day before @entity74 was shot			0
while most young couples are focused on building careers and starting a family , the @entity78 were focused on learning to live in their new roles : him as paraplegic , her as caregiver			0
they were determined to not let the injury define them			0
they would have a full and productive life , but it would take determination and hard work			0
" i think @entity74 and i were more prepared as a couple for death than for an injury like this , " @entity26 says			1
" we had talked about a lot of things , but we have never talked about this			0
" so they turned to the @entity102 for help			1
the @entity104 say the @entity102 has taken good care of @entity3 's primary medical concerns , but there was no help for @entity26			1
she longed for support and to be recognized for her role as @entity3 's caregiver			1
in the @entity112 , @entity3 loved the feeling of being part of a team			1
but the @entity116 felt abandoned			0
then , in may 2010 , a new federal law passed that promised to help caretakers like @entity26			1
under the law , caregivers would receive a financial stipend , health care , training and -- perhaps most importantly -- respite care			1
trained health care providers would come into the home and give the caretaker a break			2
@entity129 signs $ 3.6 billion veterans caregiver bill the law was supposed to take effect on january 31 , but so far , none of the new benefits have been implemented			1
the @entity102 says it is unable to provide a timeline for when the benefits will be available , but in a statement , the agency says it 's working as quickly as possible			1
" @entity102 understands that every day is a challenge for the @entity142 of our most critically injured or ill veterans			1
that 's why @entity102 is working to move forward with deliberate haste to implement this complex @entity147			1
different benefits will have different implementation timelines based upon the law 's requirements and the complexity of the benefit			2
" during the signing ceremony in may , president @entity129 hailed the legislation as " a major step forward in @entity29 's commitment to families and caregivers who tend to our wounded warriors every day			1
" when asked about the delay in implementation , a @entity163 official said " the president views delays in payments to caregivers as unacceptable			2
he has directed his team to work through options immediately to get these benefits to the caregivers who need them			2
" the @entity102 says that the new program is complicated to implement and that it has never before given benefits to nonveterans , so systems must be out into place to determine eligibility and prevent fraud and abuse			2
the delay has left the @entity183 felling abandoned once again			2
@entity26 has been forced to give up her career and faces decades of caring for @entity185 as much as the benefits , @entity26 is looking for recognition for the work she does to help her wounded warrior husband			1
" i had a great job , i made good money , we had plans to buy a house and move forward			2
i had a lot of potential			0
" now it 's like i 'm working for the va for free			1
" @entity74 is unable to even get himself out of bed and needs constant care with everything from feeding to using the toilet			2
for @entity26 , it 's a 24 - hour - a - day , seven - day - a - week job			1
" there are days that i think , ' how am i going to do this for the rest of my life ? ' " she says , " i love him , and i would do anything for him , and that 's what gets you though those really , really hard days			2
" through their hard work , the @entity78 have built a new life			0
a nonprofit group , @entity216 , built a wheelchair - accessible house for the @entity78 , and through artificial insemination , the couple 's hope of starting a family has come true : @entity222 and @entity3 were born in november			1
the babies add even more work for @entity26			2
given @entity74 's injury , some people have told them they have no business having kids			2
" i feel like we should be afforded all the same hopes and dreams that everybody else has , " she says			0
" i do n't think because he is injured , we should have any less dreams than anyone else			0
" after four years of dealing with the @entity102 , @entity26 says she has developed a reputation as a fighter			1
it 's a part of her role as caretaker that she takes very seriously , but she looks forward to a day when she wo n't have to waste her valuable energy fighting for their benefits			2
" despite what the @entity102 must think , i do n't enjoy fighting with them for every little thing			2
it would be nice to just be able to just ask for something and them say ' sure , it 's in the regulations , here you go			0
' that would be wonderful			0
" but the squeaky wheel gets the grease , and i squeak a lot			0

a sniper 's bullet in @entity17 left staff sgt. @entity3 paralyzed
his wife , @entity26 , works around the clock to care for him
they are waiting for a law that will provide money and training for wounded vets ' caregivers
until the law takes effect , @entity26 says " it 's like i 'm working for the @entity102 for free "
