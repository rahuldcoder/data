they stare wide - eyed from the pages of magazines , childlike in stature but engaged in extremely explicit sexual activities			1
they may be drawings , but critics say the images found on the pages of some of @entity11 's erotic manga are so disturbing they should be banned			1
" i believe that this kind of terrible material is not protected under freedom of expression , " says @entity12 , a member of the ruling @entity13			2
on wednesday , @entity11 lawmakers passed a law that will see people caught with child porn jailed for a year or fined up to $ 10,000			1
however , it does n't include possession of anime or manga depicting child abuse , no matter how sexually explicit			1
how explicit are they ? to see what 's being openly sold on @entity11 shelves , @entity28 took a hidden camera to one of the many manga stores in the @entity35 district of @entity36			1
the district is a known hub for " otakus , " obsessive members of anime and manga fandom , a worldwide group of avid followers of the genre			1
down a set of stairs , there are rows and rows of manga , many containing popular themes and images			2
but five feet away , in an area marked " adults only , " the content took a sharp turn into shocking sex scenes , apparently involving minors			0
some of the predominantly female characters wore school uniforms , hair clips and innocent expressions as they engaged in sometimes violent sex acts with dominant characters			0
should it be banned ? @entity67 , an expert on anime and manga from @entity70 in @entity71 , said @entity11 's obsession with " kawaii " or cuteness made it difficult to distinguish whether the characters in the material were depicting children or not			1
" @entity79 means a generally more infantile character			0
maybe the character is 20 years old , but maybe from your point of view , the character 's 15 years old			0
it 's very difficult , " she said			0
@entity86 , who lobbies lawmakers on behalf of the @entity88 , said a total ban on explicit content would damage the entire industry , making creators too scared to put pen to paper in case they risked breaking the rules			1
he said the characters were imaginary , so unlike real child porn , no one was hurt			1
" actual children suffering and crying is not acceptable			2
but manga does n't involve actual children			1
so there are no actual victims , " he said			0
@entity106 runs @entity107 , a nonprofit for exploited children			2
she told @entity28 she once worked on a case where a predator used a cartoon to convince a child that sex abuse was normal			2
" so the pedophiles might bring the animation and say ' this is how you practice with adults , ' " she said			2
child abuse in @entity11 while no link has been made between anime , manga and child abuse , @entity11 is facing a " serious " child abuse problem , according to a @entity124 issued by @entity125 in march			1
the paper said the number of child abuse victims jumped 20 % between 2011 and 2012 , and the number of victims , arrests and cases are at their highest levels since they started compiling statistics in 1999			2
at the same time , the number of cleared child pornography crime cases rose to 1,596 , the highest ever recorded , the paper said			1
most -- 85 % -- were @entity138 - related			0
the figures inspired the @entity140 to label @entity11 as an " international hub " for producing and trafficking child pornography			1
the @entity144 report noted that no national law addresses the " unfettered availability of sexual explicit cartoons , comics and video games , some of which depicted scenes of violent sexual abuse and the rape of children			1
" it added : ' while the @entity125 continued to maintain that no link was established between these animated images and child victimization , other experts suggested children are harmed by a culture that appears to accept child sexual abuse			1
" what is manga ? the term manga means " casual drawing			2
" the earliest examples date back to the 7th century , but it became very popular in the post-war period , @entity70 's @entity67 said			0
that coincided that with the work of the so - called " @entity172 of manga " @entity174 , the creator of " @entity175 , " one of the more popular @entity11 characters that made the leap into @entity179 media			1
now the industry is worth an estimated $ 3.6 billion in comic book and magazine sales , according to the @entity184 figures from 2013			2
animation takes in another extra $ 2.3 billion , according to the @entity186			0
as @entity67 points out , only a very small proportion of the market peddles sexually explicit material involving children			1
" very often people think manga equals sexual or manga equals violence			0
but it 's only a part of manga ... there are some very poetic , very beautiful ones , " she said			0
' @entity79 is a problem ' the bigger problem , she said , is that manga permeates @entity11 culture			1
it can be seen everywhere , from street signs to government pamphlets			0
often , the characters depicted are young , vulnerable girls who meet consumers ' desires for something " kawaii " or " cute			0
" " ' cuteness is a problem , " she said			0
" because cuteness is something that makes you feel you have to protect the person , and there 's a very fine line between ' i can protect the person ' and ' i can control the person			0
' " she said the prevalent depiction of young girls , especially in " @entity229 " material , risks giving " the wrong impression of women			0
" " if you 're looking at it all the time , how are you actually seeing people ? is it just a fantasy , or maybe some people with a bit of a wrong mind think that is actually there , and that is the way to treat women			0
so there is a risk , " she said .			0
