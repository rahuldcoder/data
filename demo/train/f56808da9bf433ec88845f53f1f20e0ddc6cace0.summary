" this is what i want -- a real musical with @entity5 characteristics , " he told @entity0			2
@entity1 has made seven musicals since 2005 and his latest " @entity29 and @entity30 " -- currently on tour in @entity5 -- draws on a collection of supernatural tales written during the early @entity28			1
underwritten by government funding , none of his musicals has yet made a profit , let alone smashed box - office records -- although a 2005 production called " @entity38 " made it to @entity41 stages in a 2008 tour			0

more recently , a @entity5 - language version of " @entity64 ! " that toured in august 2011 grossed 20 million yuan ( $ 3.2 million ) in less than a month and according to the @entity65 , a 2013 production of " @entity67 " sold out five months before its premiere			2
but high ticket prices mean these shows reach a limited audience , and it 's typically only the most accessible @entity11 hits that resonate with a @entity5 audience , says @entity75 , the head of the @entity76 at @entity78 's @entity77			1
