@entity0 , @entity1 -- high in the hills above the @entity1 capital , artist @entity3 paints at his terrace studio			1
the man who began a career using beets , carrots , tomatoes and black beans for paint creates vibrant abstractions of life and nature			2
a year ago , he infused a celestial oil painting with hues of purplish red -- symbolizing blood -- after he gazed outward and for a moment the verdant landscape turned to black			2
he knew then that something bad was coming			2
he saw the blood he had imagined on the streets of @entity0 on january 12 when the earth heaved and 150,000 people perished			0
it 's now apparent that among the earthquake 's widespread destruction were museums , galleries and other places that contained @entity1 's artistic treasures , including @entity36 's work			1
they were a troubled nation 's legacy , a key source of economic trade with the rest of the world -- and undeniable symbols of hope			2
lost , perhaps , forever			0
the earthquake 's blow to @entity1 art is staggering : the @entity49 , which launched the @entity1 arts movement in the 1940s , is severely damaged			1
the @entity52 , which housed more than 12,000 pieces from the largest private collection in @entity1 , collapsed			1
murals in the @entity56 , assembled by some of @entity1 's best - known artists , came crashing down			1
" there is no art museum run by the government of @entity1 , " said @entity59 , who runs a gallery near the @entity59 museum opened by his father			1
" this is for me like patrimony for @entity1			1
we were holding this collection for future generations			0
what will happen now ? i do n't know			0
" the significance of art in @entity1 may be hard for outsiders to understand			1
but with few functioning institutions , few outlets of expression , @entity1 's brightly colored depictions -- some laced with spiritual traditions of voodoo culture -- of sun and sea , people and animals serve as memory for a country that has suffered under dictatorships and failed governments and is today the poorest in the @entity89			1
with unemployment as high as 85 percent and a majority of @entity1 reeling in abject poverty , art has also emerged as an economic lifeline			1
" they 're painting their lives			1
they 're recording their history , " said @entity97 , executive director of @entity99 's @entity98 and co-president of the @entity101			1
" and they 're very accessible because of the colors and style			2
everyone who sees @entity1 art tends to buy it because they respond to it			1
" @entity97 said efforts are under way to enlist conservationists to help @entity1 , and a flurry of e-mails shared by collectors , curators , gallery owners and other interested parties show the urgency people are feeling to support the arts community			1
one key figure who 's been weighing in on the need to save what can be saved is @entity127 , a leading @entity1 art historian , critic and curator			1
@entity1 has a long enough history of not conserving its art , @entity127 said from his @entity132 , @entity133 , home			1
an earthquake in colonial times , fires and hurricanes , as wells as riots , revolutions and government - mandated raids of voodoo temples , destroyed much of the creativity that pre-dated the 1940s artistic boom			1
for this reason , salvaging art , including the oldest piece in @entity1 -- an 1822 painting buried in the national palace -- matters			1
@entity1 's art " will tell future generations who they are and where they come from , " @entity127 said			1
" it 's our heritage			2
and although people think that in poor countries such concepts are unnecessary , they are indeed the only thing we have			0
our cultural heritage is our pride			0
" in @entity0 , @entity59 has been frantically trying to rescue the thousands of pieces his father lovingly collected over four decades			0
among the masters : @entity169			0
@entity59 pulled out an oil - on - cardboard floral still - life painted by @entity175 in 1945 that now looks more like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing			0
some of the artworks housed in the @entity180 , which was in a wooden structure , will be more repairable , he said			0
what do you do when cement gouges cardboard or canvas ? " this ? only cement can do this , " he said , picking up some of his punctured pieces			0
on the day of the quake , @entity59 's 79 - year - old parents were in their bedroom on the top floor of the building that houses the museum			2
they were pulled from the rubble after the museum collapsed			2
@entity59 could not hold back tears when he thought of the suffering around him and stopped the conversation to recompose himself			0
the cultural loss can hardly compare			0
" at that time , the paintings were my last concern , " he continued			0
" there were lives at stake			2
" but since then , he has been going back to the rubble every day to salvage what he can			2
he knows he has to -- for the sake of his country			0
on the second floor of his gallery , he and his staff have been collecting damaged pieces , their vibrant colors dulled by the dust			0
" this is like a hospital for paintings , " he said , watching his staff strip off frames and backings			0
he picked up a damaged portrait of a fruit vendor by @entity223			0
he grew to manhood looking at the painting on his bedroom wall			2
it 's one of his favorites			2
so far , @entity59 has rescued about 1,000 pieces ; 70 percent need restoration			0
that was one room in the museum			0
@entity234 , the curator for @entity99 's @entity98 , which houses the largest public collection of @entity1 art in the @entity237 , said he hopes there is a silver lining to the tragedy			1
" hopefully this is raising awareness and shedding light on both the beauty of @entity1 and its people , as well as the incredible needs there , " he said			1
and , perhaps it will fuel a new wave of art that reveals the resilience of people here			0
it 's a blessing , " said artist @entity253			1
@entity253 depicted @entity256 's exit from @entity1 in 2004 , an acrylic - on - canvas painting of " @entity258 " waiting to take the disgraced president away			1
now , he said , he will paint people screaming , piles of bodies and tents blanketing the city 's open spaces			2
high above the misery , @entity36 , too , said he will paint again			0
when nature tells him it is right			0
" it 's a great loss for all of us , " @entity36 said of the earthquake			1
" but life continues and we will continue to create			0
" he will rely on the lush , undulating landscape before him			0
the sun and the moon			0
he will make beauty blossom from the ugliness below			0
for the future of @entity1			1
@entity2 's @entity286 reported from @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity2 's @entity287 reported from @entity288 , @entity289 .			2

among earthquake 's destruction were museums , galleries with artistic treasures
