-- for 20 years , the warts studding @entity3 's hands and feet multiplied and sprouted like gnarled roots			1
doctors believe @entity3 's unusual appearance occurred because of a immune defect and @entity8			1
his hands looked like contorted , yellow - brown branches extending 3 feet			1
unable to clamp his hands into a fist or pick up a fork , he made his living by performing in carnivals in rural @entity16			1
he became known as the @entity17			0
" his life was taken away from him , " said dr. @entity18 , an @entity19 dermatologist who traveled twice to @entity16 to treat @entity3			1

with good reason , he was a sad man			2
he wanted to be cured and he wanted hope			0
" the growths encrusting his arms accounted for nearly 12 pounds of his 100 - pound body			1
@entity3 , 36 , often became exhausted after taking a few steps because of the dense warts on his feet			1

@entity3 told doctors that the warts started appearing after getting a cut in his skin as a teenager			1
there are hundreds of types of @entity8 , some of which are linked to cervical cancer and others that cause common warts that can be acquired through cuts			1
" the hpv - 2 virus that causes common warts is the same exact wart virus that he 's infected with , except it was growing out of control , " @entity18 said			1
@entity3 has a deficiency of white blood cells , which are crucial in fighting infections , and his weakened immune system could n't fight the hpv			1
the virus hijacked his skin cells , causing it to produce massive amounts of keratin , a protein found in hair and fingernails			2

" it grew back faster			0
" the skin treatments did n't work , because they did n't address his weakened immune system , and @entity3 could not afford more medical procedures , @entity18 said			1
" here 's a man with chronic immune defect that had bad wart virus that went untreated for 20 years , " he said			1
" in an industrialized country , this individual would have come to the attention of the health care system and would have interventions that would prevent it from progressing			0
that 's the reason why it developed into an extremely bizarre , unusual appearance			0
" as @entity3 aged , his condition worsened			2
the horns clustered on his limbs , where the body temperature is lower			0
they grew at a rate of 5 millimeters a month			0
warts that looked like barnacles began to clump around his eyes and nose			2
" i am afraid that it will cover all my face , " @entity3 told an @entity16 journalist			1
" i wo n't be able to see			0
i wo n't be able to eat			0
" the growing of the warts was not painful , @entity18 said			0
but the cutaneous horns were attached to the skin , and @entity3 would feel pain if they were pulled or entangled			1
as the growths took over his hands and feet , @entity3 lost his independence , and his wife left him			1
he had worked in construction and fishing but could not longer work			0
@entity3 's siblings and parents cared for him , feeding and cleaning him			2

" i feel sad , because i can not touch them			0
" similar cases of uncontrollable wart growths have been reported in @entity167 and @entity168			0
in 2007 , @entity167 researchers reported two unrelated male patients who developed cutaneous horns on their limbs			0
both patients had the same type of @entity8 infections , according to studies			2
in 2007 , as word spread about @entity3 's condition , he was brought into an @entity16 hospital for treatment			1
about 12 pounds of cutaneous horns were sawed from his hands and feet			1
skin grafts were taken from his back and buttocks and placed on his forearm			0
@entity18 often disagreed with the @entity16 doctors ' procedures such the skin grafts , saying it was invasive and could be infected with the virus			1
after several surgeries , @entity3 has been able to walk , lift a fork and write			2
he was discharged from the hospital in early september			0
the warts have been reappearing , but @entity3 is receiving chemotherapy to stop the virus			1
