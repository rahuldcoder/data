in 2011 , sen. @entity0 told @entity2 's @entity1 that he would favor a halt of @entity5 foreign aid , including assistance to @entity7			1
in august , at the height of the recent @entity12 conflict , the @entity9 @entity8 made headlines for declaring he never proposed ending aid to the country			1
democrats and other critics seized on his sharp change in tune and blasted the likely presidential contender for flip - flopping			0
the criticism kicked off a wave of close scrutiny of @entity0 's past statements			2
on friday , @entity0 spoke with @entity1 again , saying he stands by what he told him in 2011			2
" interestingly , they keep playing our interview , @entity31			0
so we had a great interview			0
but the interesting thing of it is i actually still do agree with what i told you			0
ultimately , i think a country that 's $ 18 trillion in debt should not be borrowing money from @entity42 to send it to anyone , " he said			2
what @entity0 thinks is the ' biggest mistake ' for @entity8 he 'd like to see an end to all foreign aid eventually , @entity0 said , reiterating a line he has used often			1
" however , i think in the meantime ... i 've tried to put restrictions on foreign aid and i 've been unsuccessful			1
and so i 've come to the conclusion that maybe we should start by eliminating foreign aid from countries that burn our flag and hate us			1
and i think that would be a good place to start , " he said			0
pressed on whether he would continue to aid @entity7 in the short term , @entity0 said , " yes			1
" " it 's an eventual goal , is to eliminate all aid , " he continued			0
" but we have so many -- we have such a resistance in @entity62 to even attaching any restrictions that my goal since i 've been in @entity62 and the bills i 've introduced have been to place restrictions on countries that either hate us , burn our flag or persecute @entity68 or other religious minorities			0
" @entity0 to @entity2 : ' i do n't want to create panic ' over @entity72 @entity0 has said repeatedly that he 's considering a run for president in 2016 and plans to make his decision in the spring			1
asked whether he thinks he 's qualified for the job , @entity0 said the next president needs to be somebody with " wisdom , somebody who thinks about issues , who is n't entirely beholden to partisanship ... and we need somebody who ultimately , if they were in charge of our nuclear arsenal , would not be rash , reckless or eager for war			2
" " and i think i do meet that criteria , " he said .			0

@entity0 tell @entity2 he would ultimately favor ending all foreign aid , including to @entity7 .
the @entity9 senator has faced criticism for saying he never made such a proposal .
