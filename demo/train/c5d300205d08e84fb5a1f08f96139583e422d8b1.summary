-- @entity1 has seen a cascade of political scandals that have shaken the country the last few months , most notably the now well - publicized bloody incident in which 43 teaching students were " delivered " by the @entity8 city police to a drug trafficking group , who murdered them under the belief that they were sent by a rival gang			1
to use a cliche , it was the straw that broke the camel 's back , a strong indication that @entity1 's people are no longer willing to tolerate the current state of affairs			1
some have suggested that the government will fall , and others have said @entity1 is a failed state			1
the @entity1 government does not appear ready to fall , not even close			1
but it seems to be in a defensive situation , maybe waiting for the tempest to wane so that it can regain the political initiative			1
it is , in many ways , a crisis of confidence			1
it is as if all the problems that were not attended to through history were appearing together : the impunity allowed to wrongdoers , the politicization of justice , the corruption , the perceived interaction of different levels of authorities with organized crime , the inefficiency of the police ... and on and on			2
in other words , the wrongdoers appear to get away with murder			2
right or wrong , there is the feeling that the whole system is compromised			2
the authorities do not appear to be able to control the violent gangs that have plagued the country for the last 10 or 15 years even if they claim that a big part of the violence has been the result of the breakdown of the major drug cartels			0
but then again , they do not appear to be able to contain the more or less contrived violence present in some of the protests , in the last few years			0
yes , the seemingly small thievery , small vandalism in some demonstrations -- even the attempt to burn a gate to the @entity70 -- pale in comparison to the drug violence that have caused more than 60,000 deaths in the last 10 years			0
appearances could be misleading , but there is little help for the government in the images of apparent police impotence before the small - scale vandalism of supposed students and the increasing damages caused by so - called anarchists			2
it may be that the authorities will try publicly to present a merely defensive strategy , to avoid bigger problems			0
the country is still traumatized by the bloody repression of the 1968 students movement			2
the @entity92 authorities have allowed more than 2,000 demonstrations annually , for several years now , and @entity92 's inhabitants are somewhat inured to the demonstrations that do not break windows or throw a dump truck against a police barrier			0
then again , the images are there			0
this last 12 months have been the frame for huge corruption scandals that have cost the country billions of pesos -- and cost institutions like @entity106 a few hundreds of millions of dollars ; cases like @entity108 ( that defrauded @entity109 and banks equally ) , like @entity111 ( that allegedly polluted an agricultural region in @entity114 state and appears rightly or wrongly to have escaped with minimal costs ) and more recently the decision to overturn a bidding contest to build a railway because of the complaints of some of the international participants			0
these cases are more or less in the docket but people do not have confidence in our judiciary system and the legal maneuvering that it allows			1
and then of course , there is @entity8			0
the disappearance of the 43 students hit a nerve and has become an open wound in a way that is truly unprecedented			1
