the late @entity1 monarch @entity0 assumed the throne in 2005 , but had effectively been running the kingdom since his half - brother @entity6 's stroke a decade earlier			1
his two decades at the helm of one of the @entity11 's key strategic allies in the @entity13 world left an indelible , if ambiguous , legacy			1
here are the five most notable characteristics of his reign			2
hopes were high that @entity0 's reputation as a modernizing reformer would translate into gains for women in the ultraconservative kingdom			1
but in the face of deep - seated cultural opposition to change , the progress was less than expected , said @entity2 's senior international correspondent @entity26			1
" he promised a lot of reforms but ... he was limited by the conservative nature of @entity1 society			2
" @entity0 was the first @entity1 monarch to appoint women to government positions			1

this year , women will be able to vote and run as candidates in municipal elections for the first time , and women have been elected to boards of chambers of commerce			0
but many other restrictions on @entity1 women remain : women can not marry , leave the country , go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian , usually their father or husband			0
@entity1 remains the only country where women are not allowed to drive , despite petitions and civil disobedience campaigns by activists in recent years			0
in november , the @entity34 recommended that the ban be lifted , with restrictions , but the recommendation has not been acted on , and those who defy the ban continue to be prosecuted			0
@entity66 , who served as @entity68 ambassador to @entity1 form 2001 to 2003 , said he had frequent conversations with @entity0 about human rights , including the rights of women in the kingdom			1
" he said , ' do n't push us to breaking point ' , " @entity66 told @entity2			0
" it 's a halting kind of process of reform , one that requires this kind of juggling			1
" @entity83 , a former @entity1 political prisoner and the director of the @entity85 , said @entity0 's reputation as a reformer in some quarters was unwarranted			1
the kingdom has been under international scrutiny in recent weeks for carrying out harsh punishments , including executions and floggings			2
" reforms in @entity1 do not exist			0
this is an absolute monarchy , let 's be honest , " he said			0

but questions remain about the links between @entity1 and @entity131 terror			0
in an interview with @entity2 's @entity135 in october , billionaire @entity1 businessman @entity132 acknowledged that " unfortunately some extremists in @entity1 ... did fund certain extremist elements in @entity126 , " but insisted that the support had been stopped			0
others argue that @entity140 , the puritan form of @entity122 that is the kingdom 's official religion , promoted throughout the @entity13 world , provides the ideological breeding ground for such groups			2
@entity1 now faces a threat from @entity121 on its on border			0

" following a failed attempt in 1979 by extremist insurgents to capture @entity172 's @entity171 and topple the @entity1 leadership , the kingdom responded by becoming even more conservative , said @entity26			2
this renewed puritanism was reflected in the education system for two decades , until @entity0 began an ambitious program of modernization , despite opposition from religious conservatives			1
the centerpiece is the @entity181 , which has sent hundreds of thousands of young @entity1 abroad to study at the government 's expense			0
the aim is to develop a workforce of @entity1 nationals capable of replacing expatriate workers in higher - skilled jobs in the kingdom , but also to bring a more modern , international outlook to the kingdom			2

@entity0 had a reputation as a reformer , but his record *disappointed* some
he faced stiff opposition to reform from religious conservatives within the kingdom
some credit his commitment to education and economic reform as his key legacy
