-- hackers have been busy causing service interruptions , breaching databases , and defacing hundreds of @entity5 and @entity6 websites , as the crisis between the two countries plays out in cyberwarfare			1
the attacks have similarities to the resistance movement that sprung up among @entity14 - occupied countries during @entity15 , which took many forms including sabotage , espionage , armed confrontation and counter-propaganda			1
in addition to that list , today we can add digital or web - based actions including @entity25 ( @entity25 ) attacks , which shut down key websites , the defacement of government websites , and breaching government or key industry networks to access sensitive documents and release them to the world			1
services like @entity34 and @entity35 may be used to capture events in real - time , and @entity38 may be used for recruitment , training and propaganda purposes			0
the global networks that enable the incredible global communication and information - sharing applications we have all come to enjoy , all use insecure hardware and software			0
just like there 's no human cell that is immune to every virus , there 's no piece of software that is immune from being exploited			0
as a result , the most powerful nations in the world today can not reliably defend their own information and communications infrastructure from targeted attacks , by even a single hacker			1
to make matters worse , many of today 's best hackers are n't employed by their respective governments			0
while the resistance movement of @entity15 had fewer skills to bring to combat than members of the armed forces , today we see a " super-resistance " composed of elite hackers , for whom cracking a secure network is certainly equal to and in some cases superior to that of a militarized cyberwarfare unit			1
@entity76 shortly after police cracked down on " @entity83 " street protesters , who were calling for closer integration with the @entity81 , in @entity82 in november last year , @entity5 security engineers began discussing the necessity of forming an all - volunteer cyberdefense force			0
by march 1 , 2014 , cyberattacks on both sides kicked into high gear			0
@entity76 , a hacker group formed under the @entity90 umbrella , posted a warning to @entity6 president @entity92 that his aggression against @entity94 would not stand on march 1 , 2014			1
since then , members of @entity76 have been attacking @entity6 business and government websites on a daily basis , including the website for the @entity6 @entity100 , the website of the @entity103 region , @entity6 's narcotics control service , and even a @entity6 escort service			2
@entity6 @entity106 is another group of hackers , some of whom are @entity6 , who oppose @entity92 's annexation of @entity112 and have been relentless in their attacks against @entity6 businesses and agencies such as @entity116 -- @entity6 's sole agency authorized to sell defense and dual - use products and technologies to foreign entities -- and @entity122 -- a @entity6 it security company that provides services to @entity124 , @entity125 , and other important organizations			1
like @entity76 , @entity106 considers itself part of @entity90			0
@entity90 while the name @entity90 is frequently associated with cyberoperations that support revolutionary movements , that was n't the case with these next two groups : @entity94 and @entity136 , both of whom are @entity138 groups			2
@entity94 attacked @entity140 websites on november 7 when @entity94 was considering establishing closer ties with the @entity81 as well as @entity140 membership			2
on march 15 , @entity136 attacked @entity140 websites again , however those attacks were a small percentage of @entity136 's onslaught against several hundred @entity5 government and commercial websites from march 3 up until the present			0
the group 's logo and name come directly from @entity94 's old special police unit " @entity153 " and there are rumors that the group is composed of either @entity5 or @entity6 former security services personnel			1
as of march 18 , @entity5 prime minister @entity158 said that @entity94 would not be seeking @entity140 membership , a move designed to placate @entity6 as well as @entity94 's large @entity6 - speaking population			1
@entity158 also announced a willingness to maintain political ties with the @entity81 but will delay signing any economic agreements for the time being			0
' @entity166 ' some @entity168 pundits have drawn similarities between the current cyberattacks and those that happened during previous conflicts			0
most of the @entity176 government 's communications systems were shut down by @entity6 hackers during the conflict there in 2008			2
but in fact there 's very little similarity , and no actual evidence linking the @entity6 government to the current wave of cyberattacks against @entity5 websites			0
this is not a page out of the " @entity189 " for several reasons : firstly , the @entity191 , a government - financed @entity6 youth organization that was responsible for the attacks against @entity195 in 2007 and @entity176 in 2008 is no more			1
and secondly , in 2008 , @entity6 hacker forums were actively recruiting volunteers for attacks against @entity176			2
in fact , many @entity6 hackers are angry with @entity92 and are supporting an independent @entity94			1
@entity201 has not stood still since august 2008			0
in 2010 , @entity6 published a new military doctrine which acknowledged the " intensification of the role of information warfare " and assigned as a task to " develop forces and resources for information warfare			0
" @entity6 and most other nations have been investing hundreds of millions of dollars to improve their capabilities to conduct electronic warfare , information warfare , and cyber warfare via increasingly sophisticated means ; and by that i mean techniques that include compromising a nation 's electrical grid or gps navigation system from the canopy of a combat helicopter			2
@entity6 , in particular , has spent the last few years developing dual - use technologies that will never be seen or defended against by its target -- for example , malware research that could be used to both defend against malware in peace time and use malware offensively as part of a military operation			1
but there will always be highly - skilled civilians who can quickly organize online , distribute easy - to - use denial of service tools , and cause mayhem and embarrassment to the enemy , whoever he may be			0

the @entity94 - @entity6 crisis is playing out in cyberwarfare , says @entity248
hackers have been causing service interruptions and breaching databases , he says
@entity248 says the attacks have similarities to the resistance movement in @entity261
he says the most powerful nations can not reliably defend their infrastructure from attacks
