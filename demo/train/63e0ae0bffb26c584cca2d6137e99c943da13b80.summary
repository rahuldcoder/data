-- it sounds more like schoolyard taunting than a debate involving presidential power , negotiating with terrorists and bringing home a captured @entity8 soldier			0
political leaders escalated their rhetoric and raised new arguments on tuesday about the secret deal that obtained the release of @entity15 sgt. @entity14 on may 31 in exchange for five @entity18 figures detained at @entity19			1
the controversy touches on a range of volatile issues -- ending the @entity24 war , releasing @entity19 detainees , accusations by members of @entity14 's unit that he deserted -- and it comes in an election year that has further widened the seemingly maximized partisan divide in @entity33			2
costs from swap will include " lost lives " house speaker @entity37 , a leading @entity39 voice , told reporters he had no doubt " that there are going to be costs , lost lives associated with what came out of this , " calling the swap a de facto deal with @entity18 terrorists			1
on the @entity53 side , @entity50 allies of president @entity51 said the deal mediated by the government of @entity56 came together too quickly to consult with @entity57 over an exchange that critics from both parties have labeled too costly			1
" all i can tell you is this : ( the government ) knew a day ahead of time that the transfer was going to take place			2
they knew an hour ahead of time where it was going to take place , " said sen. @entity68 of @entity69 , while his @entity53 colleague from @entity71 , @entity72 , noted the military 's top leadership fully backed the exchange			1
" whether you agree with them or not , its critically important that the @entity8 people know that the chairman of the @entity83 and the vice chair of the @entity83 strongly recommended this agreement knowing full well @entity14 , one , had left his unit and knowing full well how bad these @entity18 people were , " @entity72 said			1
the dispute involves both the dynamics of the exchange and the endless argument between the executive and legislative branches over presidential powers			0
legal requirement or courtesy ? members of both parties complain the @entity51 administration should have let @entity57 know ahead of time that the exchange was taking place			1
some cite the 30 days ' notice called for by the @entity103 , while others say a simple heads - up would have sufficed			0
" it 's just a matter of courtesy , whether it was in law or not , " said conservative sen. @entity106 of @entity107 , a regular critic of the president			0
" a matter of this importance should have been discussed with at least key leaders in the @entity57			2
" administration officials say the deal came together quickly , and the risks to @entity14 and the military commandos involved in collecting him near the @entity24 - @entity122 border required keeping the exchange top - secret			1
" this was a secret military mission in which disclosure of the mission could put into jeopardy not just the life of sergeant @entity14 but also the lives of the @entity8 servicemen who were involved in the mission , " @entity125 spokesman @entity124 said tuesday			1
" so discretion on this matter was important			0
" however , @entity138 chairman @entity137 of @entity139 called such reasoning for not notifying @entity57 " absurd			2
" " nothing in the law requires the secretary of defense to disclose the physical details of the transfer , " said @entity137 , a @entity39			0
" they are merely required to notify us in a classified manner that a transfer will take place , and of the conditions set to prevent a terrorist from re-entering the fight			0
" @entity37 noted that he was briefed as early as six months before another significant and secret military mission -- the 2011 raid that killed @entity157 leader @entity156			1
" i was given a heads - up several days before " the @entity156 mission , @entity37 said			2
" so this idea that they could n't trust us to not leak things is just not true			0
" @entity53 sen. @entity163 , a moderate from @entity164 known for criticizing the administration at times , said his main concern was the release of five @entity18 figures who could return to the battlefield against @entity8 forces and interests			1
who was swapped for @entity14 ? congressman : deal gives ' no guarantee ' @entity18 figures will be tracked under the exchange , the released @entity18 detainees were taken to @entity56 , where the government says it will keep them under watch for at least a year			1
but some lawmakers fear there 's no guarantee			0
" how we are sure that the @entity56 are going to do what they are supposed to do and we are able to keep ( the released @entity18 figures ) from engaging again , " @entity163 told reporters			1
a memorandum of understanding between the @entity8 and @entity56 on the deal that freed @entity14 offered " no guarantee " that the five @entity18 commanders exchanged for the captured @entity15 sergeant would be tracked , a @entity53 member of the @entity196 told @entity0			1
rep. @entity197 reviewed the agreement and said , based on his reading , that it is possible the former @entity8 detainees " might disappear even during the first year in @entity56			2
" @entity197 told @entity0 's @entity202 that the @entity8 has " some capability to track them while in @entity56 , " but after the first year , he said , all bets are off			1
" we have to expect them to return to the fight , " @entity197 said			2
@entity8 secretary of state @entity209 defended the swap in an interview with @entity0 over the weekend , saying the former detainees would be monitored closely , and not just by officials in @entity56			0
he would n't say who else will be watching , but he said the @entity8 is confident the conditions of their release will be honored			0
@entity219 spokeswoman @entity218 said tuesday that the @entity51 administration had received " assurances from @entity56 " during the deal			0
" we have acknowledged that some of these individuals could attempt to return to activities that are of concern			0
the president said so explicitly on his trip last week , " she said			0
" but we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if , in fact , they are engaging in activities that threaten our defenses			0
" @entity53 complain about lack of notice administration officials gave a classified briefing to the @entity239 on tuesday after a similar session on monday with @entity125 members			2
on wednesday , defense secretary @entity242 will appear before @entity137 's armed services committee to discuss the exchange , which he signed off on as the @entity246 chief			0
" he looks forward to explaining why the president 's decision to secure the release of sergeant @entity14 was the right one , and why the process we undertook in doing so was in keeping with our national interests , " @entity246 spokesman rear adm. @entity247 told reporters on tuesday			1
after the briefing to @entity125 members , some said they were told as many as 80 to 90 administration officials knew of the pending exchange ahead of time , while @entity57 did not			1
@entity124 told reporters the figure of 80 to 90 officials discussed in the classified briefing referred to the number with knowledge of intelligence involving @entity18 activities in @entity56			1
the number of administration officials who knew ahead of time of the @entity14 swap was smaller , @entity124 said , but he refused to provide a specific figure			1
@entity197 told @entity0 's " @entity278 " that @entity125 officials should have told congressional leaders , even if the law gave them wiggle room			1
" i think the president had the constitutional authority ... to make this decision without consulting with @entity57 , " @entity197 said			1
" but i think it would have been wiser , far wiser , for the administration to have notified , certainly the leadership of @entity57 in the interest of having good relations			0
" polls show divide , with more disapproving more @entity8 disapprove than approve of @entity14 's release in exchange for five @entity18 detainees , according to two new national polls			1
the surveys also indicate a wide partisan divide , with most republicans opposing the deal while most @entity53 approve of it			2
@entity14 went missing on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity24 's @entity299 province , where he was deployed with the @entity300 , @entity301 , 4th @entity302 , @entity303			0
an @entity15 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official who was briefed on the report			0
the @entity15 has no definitive finding that @entity14 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity15 officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity8 military official told @entity0			1
the prisoner exchange has become a political football , with republicans who once called for the administration to work for @entity14 's return now saying the cost was too high			0
was @entity323 's red meat joke a bit too raw ? slow recovery @entity14 is " continuing to improve every day " as he recovers at a military hospital in @entity329 , @entity246 spokesman col. @entity326 said monday , but he has n't spoken with his family yet			2
the " decision to speak with the family is a decision the returnee has to make when he or she is emotionally in the right place to make the phone call , " @entity326 said			0
when he is ready , @entity14 will be flown to the @entity336 in @entity337 , where he may be able to reunite with his parents			0
as @entity14 recovers , details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity			0
citing an @entity8 official , the @entity342 reported sunday that @entity14 told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage			1
@entity0 reported friday that @entity14 has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape , according to a senior @entity8 official , who spoke on the condition of not being identified			0
the official also told @entity0 that @entity14 suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse			2
@entity51 : ' i make absolutely no apologies ' for @entity14 swap opinion : why we leave no man behind @entity0 's @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 and @entity369 contributed to this report .			2
