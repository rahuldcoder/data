by @entity1 in november , @entity0 will have stumped for candidates in over 15 states , with sometimes multiple events at each destination			1
what does this mean : lots of speeches			0
as most politicians have some formula of commonly used phrases and lines of attack , the former secretary of state has started to shape a stump speech with similar wording for praise of those she endorses and jabs for her @entity23 opponents			2
the lines are more than just cliches , however			0
they shed light on the type of campaign @entity30 would have if she decided to run for president in 2016 , and highlight what she will focus on and how she has learned from many of the mistakes that caused her to lose to @entity36 in 2008			1
here are @entity0 's seven most used lines on the 2014 stump : 1			1
) [ @entity41 candidate 's name ] is the " right leader at the right time with the right plan " this is @entity30 's go - to endorsement line and she 's used it regularly this fall			1
" there is no doubt the governor is the right leader at the right time with the right plan , " @entity30 said during an event with gov. @entity48 in @entity49 last week			1
@entity30 used the same line -- almost exactly -- for @entity55 candidate @entity54 in @entity56 and sen. @entity57 in @entity58 this month			1
" you are convinced as i am convinced that @entity54 is the right leader and the right time for @entity56 hard working people , " @entity30 said of @entity54			1
) " it 's as though the other side wants to cast an air of amnesia " @entity30 , who spent four years separated from politics as @entity67 's top diplomat , has stepped up her @entity23 attack lines on the stump , and she seems extremely fond of linking the " other side " with " amnesia			1
" " it appears to me that the campaigns being run against them are depending on the voters of @entity58 having a mass case of amnesia , " @entity30 said in her endorsement of @entity57 and @entity58 gov. @entity73			1
they want voters to " somehow just forget the accomplishments			0
" @entity30 made a similar argument for @entity82 , @entity83 ' @entity55 governor nominee , earlier this month			1
@entity23 are counting on " amnesia in this midterm election , " @entity30 said , adding they were hoping " people will forget what they have done and what they could do			1
we have been down the road			0
that is what is happening			0
" at a fundraiser in @entity94 earlier this year , she said this : " it 's as though the other side wants to cast an air of amnesia			1
" the line appears to be borrowed from her husband , former president @entity30 , who while stumping for candidates in 2010 accused @entity23 of " amnesia			1
" " the @entity23 are trying to make this a referendum on people 's anger ... with a good dose of amnesia , " @entity30 said while endorsing sen. @entity103 in 2010 , according to reports			1
) " you ca n't take anything for granted			0
" @entity30 usually employs this line when she is stumping for @entity55 who are way up in the polls			1
" if you do n't show up , you do n't know what is going to happen , " @entity30 said in @entity115 earlier this month where she endorsed gov. @entity118 and sen. @entity119 , two @entity55 who look likely to win			1
" you ca n't take anything for granted			0
" the line is more than just a call for voters to activate , however			0
in 2008 , @entity30 found herself with a sizable lead over then - sen. @entity36			2
@entity30 went on to lose the nomination fight and some critics of the campaign said it was because @entity30 's top advisers saw her win as a forgone conclusion			1
but as much at it is a call to voters , the line is a nod to what @entity30 has learned about campaigning			2
" i want you to promise yourselves before you leave here tonight that you wo n't just come to this beautiful @entity143 and listen to the speeches and the music then go home feeling good , " @entity30 said in @entity56 where she endorsed frontrunner @entity54 for governor			2
" you need to resolve to do everything you can to make sure you do n't take this election for granted			0
) " everyone deserves a second chance , a third chance ... " @entity30 has focused a great deal on economic populism on the stump , an issue other @entity55 thinking about seeking the presidency in 2016 have started to tweak @entity30 on			1
" everyone deserves a second chance , a third chance to keep going and to make something of themselves , " @entity30 said in @entity156 earlier this year			2
" that was one of the most important lessons of my life			0
" @entity30 usually uses the line to encourage compassion from a crowd , and to show that she has compassion , too			2
" the only direction that matters in life is forward , " @entity30 said in @entity115			2
when you get knocked down get right back up , recognize there is worth and dignity in every human being and that everyone â € ” everyone â € ” deserves not just a chance but a second chance and even a third chance and a better life for themselves and their families			0
) " women hold a majority of minimum wage jobs in our country			0
" this is a double whammy for @entity30 : in one line , she nods to women and the economic struggles that many women -- and men -- are experiencing			1
@entity30 's many appearances have focused a great deal on women and this line has become a staple			1
" women hold a majority of minimum wage jobs in our country , " @entity30 said in @entity202 earlier this month			1
" when women succeed , @entity67 succeeds			0
" @entity30 used a similar line in @entity208 while stumping for sen. @entity209 , at an event for the @entity211 earlier this year at an event with other female politicians in @entity214 , @entity214 in september			1
" if we had been able to close the gap between men and women participating in the work force , our @entity216 would be 10 percent higher , " @entity30 said at the event			1
" why are we leaving 10 % on the table because we do n't do enough to give women the support that they need to be empowered , to take care of themselves and their families ? " 6			0
) " grandmother glow " @entity0 recently became a grandmother , and those who attend her stump speeches get reminded of that pretty quickly			2
@entity30 has made her new granddaughter -- @entity233 -- a staple of her stump speech and usually uses the one month old to pivot to her vision for the future and the world she and other @entity55 want to leave for their children and grandchildren			1
@entity30 unveiled the line during an october paid speech in @entity244 , @entity245			2
" you look beautiful , " said the moderator of a question and answer with @entity30			2
" i think it is a grandmother glow , " she responded			0
since then , the line has been regularly repeated			0
she took the line a step further in @entity254 , @entity208 on saturday , giving a nod to the city 's name within the first two minutes of her speech			0
" it is pretty excited being here in @entity254 , " @entity30 said			0
" i mean , it is true that i am a new grandmother , a month tomorrow			0
i still have that grandmother glow			0
" she added , " but i just ca n't tell you how much we love the name			0
) " fear is the last resort of those who have run out of hope " this is another way @entity30 hits republicans			0
she accuses the party of peddling fear because , as she says , that is what people do when they have " run out of gas			0
" the line is regularly used when she is endorsing candidates who are facing stiff opposition and a sizable amount of outside spending and ads. " elections come down often to who 's got more money , who 's peddling more fear and who turns out , " @entity30 told the audience in @entity208			2
" we want leaders like @entity209 , who appeal to our hopes , not our fears , " she later added			0
so far , $ 80 million has been spent in @entity209 's race against @entity296 and local voters have complained about the number of negative ads. " there is a reason that the senators and the governor 's opponents are running campaigns based on fear , " @entity30 said in @entity58			2
" fear is the last resort of those who have run out of hope ... run out of gas			0

@entity0 is shaping her campaign speech , *including* some *recyclable* lines
@entity30 's stumping for @entity55 has focused on women and the middle class
@entity30 often says that the candidate she backs is the " right leader at the right time with the right plan "
also familiar : " it 's as though the other side wants to cast an air of amnesia "
