-- she was dubbed " @entity6 " after winning gold at the @entity3 , but @entity4 prefers to be known as " @entity5			1
" her coach , however , says she is more like @entity8 -- and the judo star herself claims she once saw a fairy like @entity11			1
a self - confessed lover of junk food , @entity4 is far from your average athlete -- and she is breaking new ground in a most traditional sport that was founded in her native @entity18 in the late 1800s			1
" no - one like her has won the @entity24 before , " @entity19 , @entity4 's coach at the @entity20 , told @entity0 's human to @entity22			1
" so i think she has made a new history in the world of judo			2
and for kids who practice judo , they do n't have to be pushed into certain stereotypes anymore now that they have @entity4 who has broken those barriers			1
" @entity4 , who turned 26 last month , earned her nickname not just for the ferocity of her fighting style , but also because of its unfettered natural instincts			1
" there are tons of players in @entity18 who are better at judo than me , but the one thing that i can beat them at is my spirit , " she says			1
" i tend to go with just my spirit only , so my technique lags behind			1
my judo is sloppy compared to others '			2
" i just go with the feel			2
i 'm often called ' beast ' because i stay natural , and wild , i think			2
i just follow what the instinct tells me			0
it 's just like how people put up an umbrella when rain starts			2
i just naturally react to the flow of that situation			0
" @entity18 has traditionally dominated judo since its first appearance at the @entity62 in @entity63 , though it was not until 1992 that women were able to compete for medals			1
" a judoka like her is unique in a female , " @entity19 says of @entity4 , who at @entity3 became the first @entity18 woman to win gold in the 57 - kilogram class			1
" she has a girlish side to her , but she is more like @entity8 , with a heart of a young boy			1
she has something really pure about her			0
" @entity4 is from @entity78 , the coastal capital of @entity80 which is also bordered by the @entity18 @entity81			1
" i used to live where there were lots of bugs and forests and nature , " she recalls			0
having started judo at the age of six , by junior high school she was traveling the world as a national representative			2
" my mother said , ' you 're lucky you can go to so many different worlds			0
' so i promised her , ' i will take you there			0
' " in the beginning it was that i just did n't like losing , but when i thought i want to take my parents to other countries for the matches , when the goals that were only mine started involving other people , i became stronger			0
" @entity19 says @entity4 's family " support her in a way that 's invisible to the eye -- they support her soul			1
" and that attitude has helped her respect not only her teammates , but her rivals too			0
" @entity18 judo is very high level , so it is hard to become the representative			1
and once i do become the representative , that means i am representing all my rivals , so i carry everyone 's emotions to my games , " she says			2
@entity4 was not only @entity18 's first female victor in her weight category , she was also the only one of the judo team to win a title at @entity3 as well as her country 's first of seven gold medalists at that @entity24			1
" it was fun , but all other emotions were mixed because many of my teammates lost , " she says			0
" it was something more than frustration			0
the two players who had lost their matches before me still came by to cheer me up			0
i was touched by how amazing they were , and then the feeling of respect to them was stronger than frustration ( towards the losses )			0
" i fought my match holding the respect to them , thinking i would never forget their existence			0
" for @entity4 , judo is a microcosm of what it means to be @entity18 -- from the bow at the start of a fight , to the acknowledgement at the end			1
" @entity159 's philosophy -- to start with a propriety and end with a propriety -- is @entity18 spirit itself , so i think judo is something that expresses the true @entity18 - ness , " she says			1
while there are many ways of scoring points in the sport , the ultimate goal is to achieve " ippon " -- a decisive move which ends a contest			0
" if you win perfectly by @entity170 , your opponent can be convinced that it was a perfect throw and she had lost			2
it is accepting your defeat			0
i think that 's beautiful , because that 's accepting yourself and your weakness			2
" @entity4 admits one of her weaknesses is her diet , which she is trying to change in order to stop a long series of injuries to most parts of her body ( " my arm , my nose , my fingers , and my elbow ... also my medial ligament , both my ankles			1
" ) " recently i 've been eating a lot of organic food and stuff like that			0
organic vegetables are a little expensive , but what you eat comes back around to you , " she says			0
" i have a really unbalanced diet , and i like sodas , coke , ice cream , snacks and chocolates and everything like that , but i 'm trying to stay away as much as possible			0
i 'm trying to control myself			0
" injuries are part of life as a judoka , and @entity4 says they provide important lessons			1
" i broke my finger during the world championships , but the message then was that i was doing a judo that just pressed forward without even looking at my opponent , " explains the fighter , who went from fifth in the world in 2009 to champion the following year			2
" my fighting spirit was bare and raw and it lacked a cool mind , so i understood that the bare fighting spirit was not good enough			1
i learned through my injury that i have to have a cool mind along with my hot spirit			2
" however , @entity4 's mind is clearly a curious thing -- as evidenced by her admission that she believes she once saw a fairy			1
" in @entity18 we have tea made out of barley , and we have it in this big bucket during training which everyone can drink out of			1
and one time from that bucket , a tiny person this size -- like @entity11 without the wings -- came out and flew away			0
" but that was only that time and i have n't seen any since			0
it just simply strayed in and then left so that it wo n't be found by humans			0
" while @entity4 is aiming to defend her title at @entity252 , an appearance at her home olympics in @entity63 four years later may be a less likely dream -- but not for younger generations of judo hopefuls			1
" there are many children who do n't have a dream in @entity18			1
i did n't have a dream when i was in elementary school , so i painfully understand the anxiety to that , " she says			0
" but by watching sports together through the @entity24 , we can share our dreams with the children			2
and the more children share those dreams , the more they will be able to have their own			0
" while @entity4 did n't have any particular goal -- judo was so entrenched in her life from early on that she could n't imagine doing anything else -- there was one recurring thought in her mind			1
" i used to wonder what it would be like if every single person in the world smiles at once			0
" @entity282 , and the whole world smiles with you -- even if you 're a " beast			0

@entity4 is the first @entity18 woman judoka to win @entity24 gold in 57 kg division
she was the only *member* of @entity18 's judo team to claim a title at @entity3
one of her coaches describes her as being " like @entity8 , with a heart of a young boy "
@entity4 is known for fighting with her " wild " spirit rather than technique
