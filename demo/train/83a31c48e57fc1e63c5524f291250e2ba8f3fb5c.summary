-- @entity1 has won the @entity2 -- now it wants to rub salt in @entity5 wounds by pulling off a whitewash			1
tuesday 's victory in @entity8 gave @entity1 an unassailable 3 - 0 lead with two games remaining -- two games in which it will attempt to exact revenge on an @entity15 side which has dominated the ashes in recent years			1
having lost the previous three @entity2 series , @entity1 was expected to put up a brave fight against an @entity15 side which triumphed 3 - 0 on home soil only a few months ago			1
instead , it produced a performance full of courage , vigor and quality -- blowing @entity15 away with a level of cricket which simply proved too aggressive and intense for the touring side			2
victory in @entity8 by 150 runs ensured the @entity2 urn returned to @entity1 after a 1,577 day absence and left captain @entity33 with even more reason to celebrate his 100th test match appearance			1
" this is a special feeling , " @entity33 told reporters after sealing his first @entity2 win as skipper			2
" you wo n't find one guy in the changing room , player or support staff , who wo n't say this is the pinnacle , playing @entity47 against @entity15			2
" i am going to enjoy 3 - 0 for as long as i can tonight			1
i am going to enjoy this feeling , but i can guarantee you there wo n't be any complacency			0
" we will turn up in @entity53 100 % ready to go and be doing everything we have done in the first three test matches			0
" @entity1 will now be aiming to produce a repeat of the 2006 - 7 series when it defeated @entity15 5 - 0 in a humiliating whitewash			1
that defeat signaled a period of introspection into @entity5 cricket with the publication of the @entity66 report -- a 19 - step guide to improving the national team			0
since then @entity15 has improved rapidly , winning three @entity2 series in succession in 2009 , 2010 - 11 and 2013			1
in august 2011 it became the top ranked side in test match cricket -- but it has struggled since being replaced by @entity73 at the summit in 2012			0
its 2013 3 - 0 home victory over @entity1 was far from convincing with @entity15 's batsmen coming in for particular criticism			1
the team 's failings , particularly with the bat , have been greatly exposed by an @entity82 side led by the fast bowling of @entity84			0
@entity84 has taken 23 wickets in the opening three tests after failing to make the squad for the previous @entity2 series			1
only @entity90 , 22 , has managed a century for the tourists in the opening three @entity47 matches			0
@entity15 , which lost @entity93 to a stress - related illness following the first @entity47 defeat at @entity96 , has failed to reach 400 in a single innings since it faced @entity98 in @entity99 in march 2013			2
here , against a rampant @entity82 bowling attack , it wilted like the @entity15 teams of old , which were so often brushed aside			2
needing an unlikely 506 in its second innings to win the contest at @entity8 's @entity105 stadium , it fell 150 runs short despite a magnificent 120 from newcomer @entity90			1
it means @entity15 will now head into the @entity108 clash at the @entity109 with only pride to play for			0
" the simple fact of the matter is we have n't had enough players in form with either bat or ball , " captain @entity111 told reporters			0
" you ca n't put it any more honest than that , and people in the dressing room know that			0
" it hurts like hell when you come into a contest and you end up being second best			0
" the two teams will meet in the fourth test at the @entity109 on december 26 before moving on to @entity130 for the final contest on friday january 3 .			0
