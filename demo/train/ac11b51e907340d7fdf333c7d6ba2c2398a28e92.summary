@entity0 -- president @entity2 and @entity4 challenger @entity3 step into a more free - wheeling town - hall style debate on tuesday night , a setting that has given the two coolly intellectual candidates some trouble in the past			1
both will have to recalibrate their approaches from their first encounter on oct. 3 , which was won by @entity3			1
" i think @entity2 assumes he will do better in town hall debates because he has an advantage on empathy , " said @entity15 political science professor @entity14 , adding that @entity2 is going to have to " show a little more passion and fire in his belly			1
" five things to watch for in tonight 's debate @entity3 could be less aggressive , which earned him points in the first debate , and focus more on trying to narrow the likability gap			1
" because @entity3 is gaffe - prone he is going to do everything he can to come across as warm and empathetic , @entity14 said			1
@entity1 chief political correspondent @entity31 will moderate the second debate at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			0
she is first woman to do so in two decades			0
the town hall format presents challenges and opportunities for the candidates , @entity31 said			1
both have held a number of town hall forums during the campaign season â € ” exchanges that have n't exactly sizzled , political experts say			2
@entity31 on moderating town hall debate : ' it 's harder to dodge ' that 's because @entity2 tends to become professorial and @entity3 stiff in such settings			1
" the danger of the town hall is that you 're getting ( questions ) from the audience , " said @entity50 , a debate professor at @entity15			2
" it 's either because they 're either not good or they are so rehearsed the responder has a hard time			0
" other candidates have struggled in town halls			1
television cameras caught then - president @entity64 when he looked at his watch during a town hall debate in 1992			1
in 2000 , vice president @entity67 got in @entity4 rival @entity69 personal space which made for an awkward moment			2
the unpredictable nature of the questions also has perils , she said			0
in 2004 , president @entity69 struggled to answer a woman 's question on three wrong decisions that he 'd made			2
that debate was also full of testy back and forth â € ” the types of exchanges that spell trouble for politicians , political experts say			0
in the last presidential town hall debate , @entity4 nominee @entity85 wandered across stage while @entity2 , then a senator , answered a question			1
" i worry for @entity3 that this is where he gets excitable			1
i wish someone would tell him to count to three before he opens his mouth			0
@entity95 leads to more quips , " @entity94 said			0
" @entity97 is not likability			2
" 10 debate moments that mattered though according to polls @entity2 ranks higher in the likability department , he , too , struggles in town halls			1
" it 's his worst format , " @entity94 said			0
" it was not as pronounced as @entity85 wandering around			0
@entity2 in a town hall is more long winded			1
he just ca n't help himself			0
" @entity2 came up against his long winded nature during a @entity109 town hall event in 2010 when then - @entity2 supporter @entity110 told the president she was " exhausted " from defending him			1
instead of answering @entity110 's question directly , @entity2 talked around it for four minutes			1
the candidates also will have to work to connect with both the television viewing audience watching at home and the group of voters sitting in the room			1
" they are going to have roughly 80 people , as i understand it , looking at them in addition to me			0
you know and i know it is very easy for politicians to run over a reporter â € ” they do n't care , " @entity31 said			0
" there is no price to be paid for being rude to a reporter , not answering the question			0
but 80 undecided voters looking at you , and some of them getting up and going , " well , what about this ? " it 's just harder to dodge			0
" @entity137 : share your questions for candy a @entity1 / @entity141 survey conducted just after the first debate suggests that it did n't change opinions of the president			0
forty - nine percent of debate watchers said they had a favorable opinion of @entity2 before the event , and that number did n't change afterward			2
it was pretty much a similar story for @entity3 , whose favorable rating among debate watchers edged up two points , from 54 % before to 56 % after			2
still , both could use the less predictable nature of the town hall setting to their advantage , political experts say			2
" this town hall forum offers president @entity2 a chance to communicate in a different way than has been expected and more effectively			1
everyone expects him to come out swinging			0
... i think it would be more creative and effective if he focuses on audience members and the middle class and his plans for the future and why they are more effective than his opposition , " said @entity164 , a senior political analyst for @entity1			0
@entity3 too could use his strengths to score points			2
" @entity3 's strength is dignity , " @entity164 said , adding that the @entity4 nominee seemed to relish and fare well when he was on the offensive during the first debate			1
" he 's got to bring the same level of energy and go more indirectly with the president through the person he 's talking to			0
" get instant updates on @entity1 's live blog @entity1 political editor @entity184 contributed to this story			0

president @entity2 and @entity3 struggle in settings that are less predictable
@entity2 will have to *squelch* professorial tone . @entity3 will have to show he can relate to voters
previous presidential candidates have also *tripped* up in town halls
@entity2 can use likability , @entity3 can use dignity to gain edge
