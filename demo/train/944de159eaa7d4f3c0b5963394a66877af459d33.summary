the history of beer in the @entity2 is a rich one dating back to the colonies , when soldiers were paid in spruce beer and cider			2
from there beer weathered a revolution , @entity10 and a right turn at @entity12 before positively exploding with deregulation of the industry through the early 1980s			2
ever since , @entity2 have been sampling , celebrating and sophisticating the unofficial national beverage in ways previously unimaginable , and it seems nearly every town 's gotten into the act			1
but not all cities are carbonated equal			0
some have begun to take beer personally , innovating its craft and consumption and throwing festivals to honor the finest ales and lagers -- creating a blueprint for the rest of the country to follow			1
still others have been doing this all along			0
this is the story of those towns , the top eight cities in @entity2 for beer explorers			2
we 've scored each out of 10 for history , breweries , bars and events , and would like to think every one of you will read the whole piece quietly , captions and all , nodding sagely as the indisputable truth of every line hits home			2
but , this is the @entity50 and if there 's one place where froth belongs besides the top of your pint of ale , it 's the comment box below			2
@entity59 , @entity60 @entity61 : 7 @entity59 boasts more breweries ( 52 ) than any city in the world			1
it 's also @entity2 's largest craft brewing market , with 69 breweries in the greater metro area , owing to state sales regulations that favor consumer tastes over discounts and kickbacks , allowing small brewers to compete with mass marketers			1
but the @entity74 is n't just about quantity			0
@entity59 is where you 'll find @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , and family - owned @entity81 , all nationally renowned for their care and creativity			1
fairs like @entity87 , the @entity88 , and @entity89 -- @entity2 's first organic beer festival -- ensure that beer spirit in the city runs high all year , while @entity93 celebrates two things exalted by the region : bikes and beer			1
@entity59 is also home to five of @entity99 's top 100 craft bars -- @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity104 's @entity103 , and @entity105			1
@entity106 draws : @entity107 , @entity108 2			0
@entity109 @entity110 : 7 the @entity111 is bursting with micro- and nanobreweries that have been experimenting with food - inspired brews like nowhere else			2
take almanac , which uses seasonal produce in its brews , or @entity118 , which picks redwood twigs and cedar bark from brewer @entity122 's own backyard			2
there 's history here , too			2
the sale of @entity127 in the 1960s precipitated the production of several signature beers at a time when mass - marketed light beers were the trend			0
the following decade saw the opening of @entity135 in @entity136 , the first new brewery in @entity138 since @entity10 and the first microbrewery in @entity2			0
following suit have been 21st @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 's , @entity144 and @entity145			0
notable bars include @entity147 and @entity148 , which hosts arguably @entity2 's preeminent barleywine festival			0
and finally , there 's @entity109 's @entity89 and the @entity151 @entity106 draws : @entity153 's @entity152 , 21st @entity154 3			0
@entity155 @entity156 : 8 with 30 - plus breweries in the county and its own @entity160 category , @entity155 's a beacon on any beer explorer 's map			1
for a pint , hit up former firefighter @entity166 's beer - centric restaurant , the @entity167 , which offers brew - paired dinners , and @entity169 , which boasts an exhaustive beer list			1
a trip to @entity155 is n't complete without sampling the suds at @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , and @entity177 , declared by @entity179 magazine the " @entity180 on @entity181			1
" as for events , @entity155 was chosen to host the 2012 @entity183 -- the " @entity189 " -- and @entity184 draws crowds from all over to celebrate 10 days of tastings , pairings and live music			1
if you visit , do n't miss five @entity155 bars mentioned in @entity193 's top 100 @entity2 beer bars : @entity194 ! @entity194 ! , @entity195 , @entity197 's @entity196 , @entity198 , and @entity199			1
@entity106 draws : @entity200 , @entity201 4			0
@entity202 @entity203 : 7 the first brewery in @entity205 emerged not long after the @entity206 dropped anchor , owing to the fact that beer was safer to drink than the water			0
though the @entity206 were aiming for @entity212 , they ran out of brew and stopped in @entity205 -- thus a beer town was born			1
eventually , @entity202 was blessed with a number of microbreweries , including the best - selling craft brewer in @entity2 , @entity218 -- producer of @entity218 -- and @entity220			1
notable hits on the bar crawl include @entity223 and @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 , alongside historic pubs like @entity228 , the @entity229 ( @entity202 's oldest ) and @entity230			0
with this lively scene , it 's not hard to believe that @entity202 consumes the most beer per capita in the @entity2			1
it 's also home to the @entity235 , the @entity237 's largest celebration of domestic micros , featuring 600 + varieties from 125 + @entity2 brewers			0
@entity106 draws : @entity160 , beer works @entity242 @entity241 5			0
@entity244 @entity245 : 8 @entity247 is fourth out of 50 states in breweries per capita , and while there are only a handful in @entity244 proper , there are loads of notable breweries outside town and in nearby @entity255			1
neighborhoods like @entity257 and the @entity258 on @entity259 are peppered with breweries			0
elsewhere you 'll find @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 and others , including @entity268 , which writer @entity269 declared " may well be @entity2 's best brewpub and restaurant			0
" @entity244 's first craft brewery , @entity273 , was opened in 1988 by @entity274 , who went on to become mayor , then governor , extending @entity244 's brewer reach to the highest levels of government			0
both @entity273 and @entity280 are a moon shot from @entity282 , and homemade beers at @entity284 are found just behind section 112 in left field			0
the @entity244 also stages what is widely regarded the largest , most prestigious beer festival in the country , the annual @entity288 , drawing sudsmeliers from all over the world to taste more than 2,200 brews			1
@entity293 : @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 6			0
@entity297 @entity298 : 7 in the city of brewery love , outfits like @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , yards and @entity304 have been vanguards of local brewing since the city 's barley rush of the 1990s			1
and since 1860 , @entity311 has been a beloved showcase for those and other local brews longer than any in @entity297			1
three less - ancient bars made @entity193 's top 100 -- @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319 , which enjoys a sterling reputation despite an endorsement by @entity322			1
and no beer itinerary is complete without writer @entity325 's favorite spot , @entity326 , a love letter to @entity328 ( and other ) brews that will awe the savviest palate			1
@entity331 is the city 's most hoppening event , but the @entity334 , begun in 2011 , is already proving a worthy companion			1
one caveat to all this beer - fueled euphoria : complicated state controls regulate the purchase of packaged beer			1
do n't let them kill your buzz			0
@entity293 : @entity344 , @entity345 7			0
@entity346 , @entity60 @entity347 : 8 with one brewery for every 9,111 people , descriptors for @entity346 include " beervana " and " @entity352 , @entity2			2
" and that number is constantly changing , with newcomers like @entity355 and @entity356 recently fattening @entity346 's ranks			0
already cemented into @entity346 beer culture is @entity359 , the godfather of local craft brewing , which recently expanded its flagship location			0
the @entity365 , like its name suggests , blends modern and old - fashioned brewing techniques for what they 're calling @entity346 's only steampunk brewery			2
getting your beer passport stamped at all nine of participating breweries on the @entity372 will net you a prize , and dog lovers will appreciate @entity375 , where they can try the world 's first organic , non-alcoholic brew made for dogs , @entity379			1
your itinerary 's bound to overlap at least one of @entity346 's annual beer celebrations , like @entity383 , the @entity384 , @entity385 , @entity386 and @entity387			2
@entity293 : @entity388 , @entity390 's @entity389 8			0
@entity391 , @entity392 @entity393 : 9 yes , @entity391			0
it 's relatively new to the beer scene , but with 11 breweries yielding the highest per - capita total in the country , it 's already building a global rep. a day trip to @entity391 offers a chance to try roughly 50 local beers , almost all of which can be tasted at @entity405 , a must - see on any @entity407 beer pilgrimage			1
but it 's less the number of breweries or bars here than it is the culture that earns @entity391 its cred			2
there is serious pride in the local craft , and its small - town appeal means all you have to do is roll over and you 'll find yourself in one of the city 's renowned breweries , like @entity421 , @entity422 and @entity423			1
the city also pumps beer into mustards , shampoos , ice creams , cakes , dog biscuits , and soaps			2
and with at least five major beer events , @entity391 keeps the party going all year round with its own @entity387 , @entity89 and @entity434 , @entity435 , @entity352 and @entity436			0
@entity293 : @entity437 , @entity439 @entity438			0

@entity59 , @entity60 , boasts more breweries than any city in the world
@entity155 was chosen to host 2012 @entity183 -- the " @entity189 "
@entity297 is a beer explorer 's must - see town , despite state controls that regulate purchases of packaged beer
