-- the women of the year helped bring the economy back from the brink , worked against tyranny , and championed equality , education and justice			1
most of all , they helped open our eyes to how much remains to be done			1
@entity10 if 2012 was the year most of us first heard about the 14 - year - old @entity14 girl , it was 2013 when we learned nobody could silence her , especially not the cowardly @entity18 men who tried to kill her			1
@entity10 had become a vocal advocate of the right of all girls to an education , a frightening prospect for the @entity18			1
in october 2012 , machine - gun toting extremists walked onto a school van , asked for @entity10 , then shot her in the face			1
instead of intimidating her , the @entity18 turned her into their own worst nightmare -- a powerful girl more admired and articulate than ever			2
this year we found that @entity10 's impact is just beginning			1
as a leading candidate for the @entity34 , her advocacy for girls inspires hope around the world			1
and she 's just getting started			2
@entity37 of @entity38 what is it about macho politicians who get so scared of brave women ? in @entity46 , president @entity44 's suppression of the political opposition spurred an unlikely force , the defiantly named punk rock group @entity38			1
the female band protested @entity44 's increasing authoritarianism			1
when five of them broke out into an @entity54 song , " @entity55 , " at @entity58 's main @entity57 cathedral , two of them -- @entity37 and @entity60 -- were arrested and put in prison			1
why did @entity44 decide to free them before their sentence was finished ? because @entity38 has become synonymous with the harshness of the @entity44 regime			1
the group 's outspokenness raised an international outcry so strong that even the @entity46 president , normally impervious to global public opinion , started to feel the pressure			2
@entity37 sent out letters describing the brutality of prison life and went on a hunger strike			1
on her release from prison , @entity37 fearlessly shouted , " @entity46 without @entity44			1
" she and @entity60 dismissed the release as a public relations stunt by a president trying to improve his image ahead of the upcoming olympic games in @entity84 , @entity46			2
that 's exactly what it was			2
@entity89 rape victim as 2012 was coming to an end , a horrific gang rape occurred in the @entity93 capital , capturing the world 's attention over the following months and , more importantly , awakening the @entity93 people to the crisis of violence against women			1
the @entity89 rape victim , a 23 - year - old physiotherapy student , was gravely injured , and she died of internal wounds in 2013			1
her tragic case galvanized @entity93 women and men to fight the epidemic of rape in @entity93 , a battle that continues in the face of even more brutal attacks			1
@entity110 when the @entity112 nearly fell into the economic abyss , there was one leader who held it together , standing up to criticism and holding firm on a controversial austerity program despite vilification and recrimination			2
the policy may not have been the best route to recovery , but in the chaos it was @entity110 who saved the @entity112			2
@entity126 named her the world 's most powerful woman , as it has for eight of the last 10 years			0
@entity131 re-elected her to a third term earlier this month			0
she emerges from the crisis as the undisputed leader of the @entity112 , and a key player as the @entity136 and @entity137 struggle to maintain their political and economic pre-eminence in the face of a rising @entity142 and a chaotic @entity143			0
@entity144 when @entity10 spoke in the @entity136 this fall , @entity144 was sitting in the audience as the young activist declared , " even in @entity147 people are waiting for a woman president			1
" endless speculation about whether @entity151 will run for president in 2016 is underpinned by the belief that she has a very good chance of becoming the next president of the @entity136			0
to a large extent , she stands as a symbol of the incomplete pursuit of equality			0
but if she becomes president , her impact would become more than symbolic			0
she would have more power than anyone on earth , and with it the opportunity to truly reshape the world			0
whatever she decides , nobody doubts her abilities			0
she has already answered the question , " is a woman qualified to be president of the @entity136 ? " with an emphatic , " you are crazy to even ask ! " @entity176 in 2006 , voters in @entity178 elected @entity176 to a four - year term as president			1
this year , they voted her back into office			1
during the last few years , the former political prisoner and pediatrician became the first head of @entity185 , working for global gender equality			0
@entity176 comes from @entity147 , the land that gave us the word " machismo			0
" but her tenure has proven to @entity147 that charisma and skill have no gender			0
can a woman be a good president ? the voters have said yes twice			0
@entity196 here 's a name you 're about to start hearing a lot more often : @entity196			0
the brilliant economist was nominated by president @entity201 to become the world 's most powerful banker , heading the @entity204			0
@entity196 is uniquely qualified for the job			0
she has a slightly more growth - oriented approach than her predecessor , and that 's good news for the unemployed , still struggling despite a booming stock market and modest economic growth			0
the highly respected soon - to - be first female @entity204 chief will get to work and tackle some of the challenges facing @entity147 's economy			0
lucky country ! @entity216 in what many people believe is a post-feminist era , women are pursuing careers and families and blazing their own trails without looking back			1
@entity216 , the chief operating officer at one of the world 's most successful social media companies , @entity225 , took time to stop and examine the landscape			0
it 's time , she urged , for women to push a little harder			1
in her best - seller , " @entity230 , " she exhorted women to lean in to their ambitions			1
equality is not yet here , she said , inspiring post-feminist women to break barriers			2
@entity216 may yet make feminism cool once again			0
opinion : for women , missteps to learn from @entity240 there was a time when women artists were the playthings of businessmen and corporations			1
today , many of the most successful women entertainers have taken control of their careers and carved their own paths			2
there are many examples , but perhaps none as impressive as @entity240 , whose career continues to reach new heights			1
she has amassed a huge fortune -- estimated at $ 300 million -- delighted her fans , and managed to stage dazzling surprises			0
at the end of 2013 , the 32 - year - old unveiled a " visual album , " an online album recorded and filmed while she was traveling the world on an enormously successful concert tour			2
when major corporations decried the unorthodox marketing of the new release , she unabashedly took them on , shocking @entity271 buyers by showing up in person and paying for their @entity274 shopping			0
@entity240 may be revolutionizing the music industry			1
the @entity277 drivers remember the @entity278 ? much of it unraveled in 2013			0
it had never quite made it to the @entity277 , where the concept of democracy is so distant that women are in many respects treated as children			2
among the many restrictions they face is the particularly crippling law that bans them from driving cars			0
despite repeated arrests , @entity277 women activists are doggedly demanding their right to drive , a symbolic and practical necessity			2
they have staged repeated acts of civil disobedience , and plan to keep doing it until they succeed			0
they may yet start their own quiet revolution			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity304 .			0

@entity306 : the women of the year helped open our eyes to how much remains to be done
@entity312 : a candidate for the @entity34 , @entity10 advocates for girls ' rights
she says punk rocker @entity37 was brave to speak out against @entity44 regime
@entity312 : could @entity240 be revolutionizing the music industry ?
