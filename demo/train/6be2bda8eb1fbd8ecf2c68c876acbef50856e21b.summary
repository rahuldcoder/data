@entity0 -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 lambasted @entity4 and @entity5 on friday for blocking efforts to topple @entity8 president @entity7 , who has lost a key general to defection			1
speaking at the @entity13 conference in @entity0 , @entity11 called on @entity4 and @entity5 to " get off the sidelines " and accused them of " standing up for " @entity7 's regime			1
she urged the other 100 or so nations and organizations represented at the summit to " make it clear that @entity4 and @entity5 will pay a price " for that position			0
" i ask you to reach out to @entity4 and @entity5 and not only ask but demand that they get off the sidelines , " she said			0
" i do n't think @entity4 and @entity5 believe they are paying any price at all , nothing at all , for standing with ( the ) @entity7 regime			1
" high - ranking general defects from @entity8 military but it was unclear whether those two nations would reverse their long - standing opposition to forcing @entity7 from power			1
the two trade partners of @entity13 have vetoed previous efforts by the @entity40 to condemn the violence in @entity13 and oust @entity7			1
neither @entity4 nor @entity5 was represented at the @entity0 meeting			0
western and @entity44 nations started the friends of @entity13 initiative because @entity5 and @entity4 posed diplomatic obstacles to tackling the @entity8 crisis			2
the @entity3 and others said they were hoping that friday 's meeting could lead to stricter economic sanctions and more support for the opposition			1
speaking after the meeting concluded , @entity11 argued for additional sanctions to be backed by a @entity40 resolution under chapter 7 of the @entity58			0
chapter 7 could ultimately authorize the use of force			0
" no transition plan can progress as long as the regime 's brutal assaults continue , " she said			2
" that 's why the entire world is looking at those few nations who have influence in @entity71			0
" @entity11 warned allies of @entity7 within @entity13 that evidence of abuses is being collected and that they should " get on the right side of history			1
" she added : " let me say to the soldiers and officials still supporting the @entity8 regime -- the @entity8 people will remember the choices you make in the coming days			1
" @entity11 's comments came as a @entity86 diplomat said that @entity87			1
gen. @entity88 of @entity13 's @entity89 has abandoned the regime			1
@entity88 , the son of a former @entity8 defense minister , defected over the killing of @entity93 , said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity			1
the official was not authorized to speak to the media			0
" he 's an inside confidant of @entity7 , " the official said			1
" so it counts that even an insider thinks it 's time to go			2
" the defector 's father and the rest of his family are in @entity0 , the official said			0
@entity86 officials told @entity1 that @entity88 was en route to @entity0			1
it was not immediately known if he had joined the @entity8 opposition			0
@entity115 foreign minister @entity114 , speaking at the end of the @entity13 meeting , called the defection of someone close to @entity7 a " hard blow " for the regime			1
" we are told of the defection of someone quite important in the regime , very close to @entity7 , which means that his close entourage is starting to understand that the regime is unsustainable , " he said			1
@entity114 said he did not know what the final destination would be for the defector , whom he did not identify by name but said was a member of the @entity131 and a longtime friend of @entity7			2
asked about the defection , @entity11 did not name @entity88 , but said an " increasing stream of military defectors " is leaving @entity13			1
" @entity138 insiders and the military establishment are starting to vote with their feet , " she said			0
" those who have the closest knowledge of @entity7 's actions and crimes are moving away , and we think that 's a very promising development			2
and it also raises questions for those who remain in @entity71			0
" friends of @entity13 meeting in @entity0 the defection is one more setback for @entity7 , who @entity11 said has been feeling the bite of economic sanctions			1
the @entity8 leader 's " currency and foreign reserves have collapsed , " she said , curbing his ability to continue his crackdown			2
but she said challenges remain			0
@entity162 was being kept afloat by " money from @entity164 and assistance from @entity4 and the failure of countries here " at the conference to tighten economic sanctions			0
" none of us is satisfied or comfortable with what is going on in @entity13 , " she said			0
but since the @entity13 met in @entity177 in february , " there has been a steady march toward ending this regime , " @entity11 said			2
@entity114 said friday 's meeting showed that the international community is uniting to voice support for the opposition , promise increased humanitarian aid for the @entity8 people and back sanctions against the regime			1
" today was not a good day for the regime , " he said			0
the @entity0 meeting comes less than a week after a conference of foreign ministers , which included @entity5 and @entity4 , met in @entity192 , @entity193 , and called for a transitional government body as a step toward ending the @entity8 crisis			0
that emergency meeting , called by former @entity198 secretary - general @entity198 , raised hopes that @entity4 was easing its position			0
but even as @entity4 appeared to agree that a key step in the peace process would be the establishment of a transitional government , the country 's foreign minister said it should not be viewed as outside powers imposing a transitional government on @entity8			1
senior @entity3 officials said the @entity3 and its @entity211 and @entity44 partners will move to impose global sanctions if @entity13 does n't quickly implement the transition plan that includes the appointment of a new government			2
diplomats at the @entity217 are working on a document that would demand restrictions on oil and other commercial business with the @entity8 regime if it refuses to implement the @entity198 peace plan for a cease - fire and a transitional government			0
a @entity40 resolution under chapter 7 of the @entity58 could be introduced next week , the officials said			0
@entity11 's marathon trip tackles a range of @entity3 foreign policy issues the officials said the @entity4 and @entity5 willingness to discuss a political transition plan in @entity13 and sign on to that plan last week in @entity192 could boost the effort to impose sanctions			1
the absence of the two nations from the @entity0 conference , however , could reflect the difficulties ahead in persuading @entity242 and @entity243 to back the resolution			0
@entity11 praised the @entity8 opposition 's six - page " vision " for a @entity8 transition that was unveiled last week at its meeting in @entity247 , @entity248			0
the @entity3 hopes the document , which has details on a new parliament and constitution , will allay fears of @entity256 and other minority groups that the @entity93 leading the fight against @entity7 will grab all of the power and take revenge on @entity7 's supporters			1
the regime is dominated by @entity256 , an offshoot of @entity264 , and the opposition is largely @entity93			0
@entity115 president @entity266 also called for @entity7 's departure friday , saying a political transition is the only way to end 16 months of violence in the @entity272 nation			1
members of the @entity8 opposition attended the @entity0 meeting , and many are pushing for the imposition of a no - fly zone in @entity13			2
opposition groups reported dozens of deaths on friday			1
the @entity281 counted at least 89 people			0
meanwhile , a @entity284 foreign ministry official told @entity1 that two children were killed and six @entity8 refugees were injured when a gas canister exploded friday at the @entity289 refugee camp in southeastern @entity284			2
@entity1 can not independently confirm reports of violence or casualties as @entity13 has limited access by international journalists			0
@entity295 releasing 2.4 million @entity13 e-mails @entity1 's @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 contributed to this report .			2
