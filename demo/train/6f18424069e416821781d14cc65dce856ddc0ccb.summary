-- despite the excitement over the royal tour of @entity3 and @entity4 , the commonly held view of politicians in both countries appears to be that the writing is on the wall for the reach of @entity12 's monarchy to its far - flung @entity14 realms			1
the @entity16 's official representative in @entity4 last year expressed support for replacing the monarch with an elected head of state , while @entity3 's ex-foreign minister and former head of the @entity22 has said the country is " inching towards republicanism			1
" but how inevitable is it really that @entity4 and @entity3 will abandon their monarch to become republics ? despite the view of the political classes in both countries , republicanism seems to be in reversal			1
this year @entity4 prime minister @entity34 restored knights and dames after nearly 30 years , bestowing titles on the incoming and outgoing governors - general			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity39 restored titular honors in 2009 after they had been abolished by a @entity42 government in 2000			1
neither of these prime ministers will create a republic			1
as in @entity12 , fondness for the monarchy has grown with the @entity48 and the popularity of the @entity50 and @entity51 , and baby @entity52 , whose attractiveness is refreshing monarchism			0
prince @entity56 has already reinforced loyalties in @entity4 and @entity3 with his visits to comfort embattled communities after the disasters of earthquakes in @entity62 and floods in @entity64			1
there are differences between @entity4 and @entity3 , however			1
the republican movement was , and is , stronger in @entity4			2
empire status to understand why , we need to turn to history			0
for a start , @entity4 was more @entity72			2
transportation of thousands of convicts to the @entity4 colonies did not lend itself to devotion to the sovereign			2
so it is unsurprising that @entity4 developed a nationalist republican tradition , expressed by the " bulletin " magazine from the 1880s -- with the motto " @entity4 for the @entity4 " -- that opposed the monarchy			2
national hero @entity86 's first published poem , " a @entity87 , " sought freedom from the " wrongs of the @entity90			0
" but no cleavage of loyalty threatened the imperial connection when @entity4 became a nation in 1901 , and republican radicals remained in the minority			2
membership of the empire conveyed a sense of pomp , pride and greatness in both countries			0
@entity3 decided its status within the empire would be grander by staying separate from @entity4			1
historically @entity3 was the more loyal dominion , and more economically dependent until @entity12 joined the @entity107 , a move that did not help monarchism			1
in 1911 , @entity3 borrowed to build a battleship for the @entity111 , whereas @entity4 established its own navy ; and @entity3 introduced conscription in the @entity114 whereas @entity4 did not			1
@entity3 was last to sign the @entity115 in 1947			2
it was not until 1986 that @entity3 finally removed the @entity12 's residual powers to make law for @entity3 under a @entity118			1
colonization and honors @entity3 @entity121 play an important part in the country 's position on the monarchy			1
there is no equivalent voice for aborigines with their harsher experience of colonization			0
the status of the @entity132 , signed in 1840 , is central in the @entity3 case , whereby the chiefs ceded government to the @entity16 in return for her protection			2
ever since , " the @entity139 " has been of supreme importance to @entity121			0
@entity4 was first to introduce a republican - style honors system in 1975 , including the @entity141			2
again , a reformist @entity143 government made the change			0
prime minister @entity145 , who led the initiative , joked that the only imperial honor he ever awarded was a damehood to dame @entity149 -- the character created by cross-dressing @entity4 comedian @entity150			1
for a while national and imperial honors systems overlapped and the @entity152 continued to use imperial honors until the end of the 1980s			0
the @entity155 was introduced by a reformist @entity42 government in 1987			0
the remainder of the @entity3 honors system , however , had to wait until 1996			2
@entity159 , the then @entity161 ( @entity160 ) prime minister , is a republican , and his stance prompted the creation of a @entity164			1
@entity159 denies that his @entity72 background explains his republicanism			0
constitutional change both @entity4 and @entity3 founded republican movements in the 1990s to act as lobby groups advocating constitutional change , the @entity3 one based on the @entity4 model			1
but in @entity3 opinion has been more evenly split between republicanism and support for a constitutional monarchy			0
recent polls put republican views in the minority , at about a third			0
@entity4 differed from @entity3 in holding a referendum on becoming a republic in 1999 , despite the prime minister 's monarchism and a divided @entity183			1
the @entity143 was near - unanimous in favor			0
in the event the people voted " no , " because republicans were divided over how the president would be appointed			0
the referendum provided for appointment by parliament , when many favored a directly elected president			0
distrust of politicians decided the result			0
the monarch 's popularity is a critical factor			0
nothing is likely to happen in either country while the @entity16 is alive , except perhaps the design of the flags currently being waved at the @entity50 and @entity51			0
as for baby @entity52 , support for his position as future heir to the thrones of @entity4 and @entity3 may be dictated in part by the sustainability of his -- and his parents ' -- celebrity status			1
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

@entity218 in @entity4 and @entity3 seems to be in reversal , says @entity216
@entity216 says neither country 's current prime minister will create a republic
but she says the two countries ' positions differ , with @entity3 historically the more loyal
@entity4 ' vote not to become a republic was in part *due* to distrust of politicians , she says
