@entity2 spokesman @entity8 announced that c - 130s with the @entity10 , or @entity10 , wo n't fly until further notice			1
the @entity7 crash follows another crash of a non-military firefighing air tanker , along the @entity17 - @entity16 border , several weeks earlier			1
the @entity2 describes @entity10 as " a self - contained aerial firefighting system owned by the @entity19 that can discharge 3,000 gallons of water or fire retardant in less than five seconds , covering an area one - quarter of a mile long by 100 - feet wide			1
" including the one went down , eight such military planes had been deployed since june 24 to fight wildfires in the @entity27 region and thus are affected by the order , said @entity30 spokeswoman @entity29			2
this is out of hundreds of c - 130s in operation around the world , and among dozens of helicopters , large air tankers and other aerial equipment that have and will continue to be used in battling fires			1
the grounded c - 130 aircraft were unique in that they include " sliding tanks that can be inserted into an aircraft without major structural modifications , " @entity39 said			2
the @entity2 decision to remove these aircraft from operation will force firefighting authorities to adjust , the spokeswoman said			1
that includes possibly altering strategy in combating the @entity52 in @entity53 , where c - 130s were among the tools being used to corral what has been described as the worst wildfire in @entity59 's history but is now 70 % contained			1
" ( these crews ) are highly trained and the best - equipped in the world , " @entity39 said			1
" they have a lot of strategies and tactics			0
" besides the tactical impact , sunday 's crash in @entity7 is taking an emotional toll as well			1
some @entity71 members died and others suffered serious injuries when their c - 130 tanker crashed around 6:30 p.m. mt ( 8:30 p.m. et ) , spokesman lt. col. @entity69 said monday			2
their aircraft was operated by the state @entity71 's @entity76 and had been deployed to fight the so - called @entity78 burning near @entity79 at the time it went down			2
evacuee : wildfire aftermath is ' kind of like the twilight zone ' " there were lives lost , there were injuries			1
we 're very grateful for the survivors , and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families who have lost loved ones , " @entity69 said , who did not specify how many people died in the crash			2
president @entity95 issued a statement sunday saluting those killed and injured in the crash , as well as others who are helping fight blazes around the country			0
" the airmen who attack these fires from above repeatedly confront dangerous conditions in an effort to give firefighters on the ground a chance to contain these wildfires -- to save homes , businesses , schools , and entire communities , " @entity95 said			0
" they are heroes who deserve the appreciation of a grateful nation			0
" those hurt are being treated in a hospital in @entity118 , @entity7 , according to @entity69			2
" you ca n't ask for people of higher character who go in harms way and volunteer to do so , " he said			0
the cause of the crash is under investigation			0
the @entity7 wildfire has scorched 4,200 acres since it began friday , according to the @entity30			2
the fire , which is fueled by dry brush and trees , was 30 % contained monday -- threatening structures and prompting an unspecified number of evacuations			0
that wildfire is one of many burning in western states , including @entity136 , @entity59 , @entity137 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity138			0
' great day ' as evacuations lifted , fight continues vs. @entity59 fire it was the second time within two months that an air tanker has crashed			0

that @entity149 air tanker was on its second run of the day fighting the @entity151 along the @entity17 - @entity16 border			0
that fire , which began june 1 , was 100 % contained on june 9 , fire officials said			0
there had been no crashes of firefighting - equipped c - 130s until sunday 's in @entity7 , with the @entity158 calling it the first crash " in the 40 - year history of the @entity10 program			1
" three state @entity164 divisions -- @entity166 , @entity137 as well as @entity167 -- operate c - 130s with firefighting capabilities , as does an @entity171 unit out of @entity53 , @entity59			1
the technology the crews is are a " valuable " resource , though they are only deployed " when everything else is exhausted , " according to @entity69			0
" when they put fire retardant down on the leading edge of the fire , it 's very effective in keeping the fire from advancing , " the lieutenant colonel said			2
there 's been no timetable given as to when the specially equipped c - 130s might return to the skies			1
the remaining crews spent monday getting together to " reflect , reset and review , " said 153rd @entity189 commander col. @entity188 , according to a @entity191 @entity158 press release			1
