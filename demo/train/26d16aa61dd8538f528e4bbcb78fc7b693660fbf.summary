-- he 's been described as the @entity2 of @entity4 airlines			1
and he certainly knows a thing or two about building a brand			2
@entity7 , ceo of @entity8 , spoke to @entity0 's @entity9 in @entity10			1
in just five years , @entity7 has built @entity8 from a bankrupt local carrier to the region 's biggest budget airline -- 18 million passengers will fly the airline this year			1
@entity0 's @entity9 talked to @entity7 in @entity16 to find out why , at the age of 37 , he would leave a comfortable job in the music industry to start a new business in the cut - throat , not to mention high risk , aviation industry			1
@entity7 : well there 's a fine line between brilliance and stupidity , so the second point in a statement that @entity2 's made is how to become a millionaire , start with a billion and start an airline			1
now i was the other way around , i did n't have a billion			0
so i think that was one of the things , that i did n't have a lot to lose			0
and i thought i was young enough			0
i got tired of the corporate life , i got tired of corporate politics			0
and i saw a business opportunity			0
and i think the key number that got me going was only six percent of @entity43 flew			0
i started looking at the prices of tickets , and to travel from one part of @entity43 to another it was almost someone 's one month salary			1
but i did n't want to be there , you know , at 55 , and say i should 've done it			0
life is about risks , life is about not being afraid to fail			0
@entity9 : but at the time , airlines were going into bankruptcy , oil prices were going through the roof , people were too scared to fly globally , did n't you think , " oh my god i 've made the worse decision of my life ? " @entity7 : no , i knew @entity43 very well			1
you put a price low enough , they 'd risk their lives			0
i think also when you start a business the most important thing is does the market want it			0
and i knew the market wanted it			0
if that 's there , everything is surmountable because people power is strong			1
@entity9 : you like to pluck people from all different walks of life , from all different professions			1
how do you meld them all together ? what 's the philosophy underlying this ? @entity7 : well i think , first is that everyone plays a part			1
i make all my senior management carry bags and things so they appreciate that			0
@entity9 : do they ? @entity7 : oh yes , they do			1
some try to shirk their duties , but it 's very hard when they see the ceo doing it -- they have to do it			1
the second is that everyone 's got ability , it 's how you bring the best out of them			1
and that 's a very motivating thing			1
if you see someone who 's carrying a bag suddenly flying a plane			2
that 's a very powerful motivator			2
you can do all the theory and books and promise people the world but when they see it in reality , boy that 's a powerful thing to see			2
@entity9 : when @entity8 started , you were known to go down , roll up your sleeves , and really get in with your staff at all levels , do you still have time to do that ? @entity7 : i have less time , but i still do it			1
i think it 's fundamental to running my company , because , unless you get down to the floor and see what 's happening , you wo n't make effective decisions			2
i do it for two reasons			0
one is , to see what 's going on , and to make sure if i 'm making the right decisions			2
and the second thing is , i still want to discover these raw diamonds			0
@entity9 : what 's the best piece of business advice you 've ever been given ? @entity7 : focus and discipline			1
stick to a plan , stick to a vision			0
you change but the vision 's still the same			2
and that came from @entity148 of @entity149			0
he has taught me about discipline and focus and i think that 's been a really good lesson for me			2
