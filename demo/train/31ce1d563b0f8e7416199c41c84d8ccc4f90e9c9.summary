@entity0 -- the arrests of 11 people accused of being part of an espionage ring under deep cover for @entity7 shocked their neighbors in the suburbs			1
presumably it was also news to president @entity11 , coming as it did right after @entity7 president @entity14 's departure			1
what should not be a surprise to any of us , however , is that @entity7 continues to spy on the @entity18			1
espionage is a fact of international life and always has been			0
the first spy manual , @entity23 , was written by @entity24 some 2,500 years ago			0
espionage fills a vital niche ; a successful operation can provide insight into intentions , plans , and human dynamics that can not be gleaned from intercepted communications or pictures from space			1
it is safe to assume that since the end of @entity38 there has never been a day that the @entity39 or @entity7 was not spying on the @entity18 , or vice versa			2
espionage will continue , even as the @entity18 and @entity7 work out a new modus vivendi			1
presidents @entity11 and @entity14 may have recently " reset " the @entity18 - @entity7 relationship , but that does not mean @entity18 and @entity7 interests or perspectives are necessarily aligned			2
there remain significant issues of disagreement over @entity51 security			0
the two countries have until recently been at loggerheads over @entity54			0
after september 11 , @entity7 reluctantly allowed the @entity18 military to operate out of bases in @entity57 , which it views as its own backyard			2
the two countries belong to the @entity60 and the @entity61 -- venues not only for cooperation , but also for sparring			0
@entity7 also has great incentive to continue its historical efforts to ferret out @entity18 's economic secrets and steal its weapons technology			2
frankly , in a world in which even allies spy on one another , the @entity7 intelligence service would be shockingly incompetent if it were not spying on us			1
espionage operations tend to operate on long timelines , and the alleged @entity7 implanting of " illegals " in this country fits the pattern			1
@entity80 and @entity81 came to our shores more than 20 years ago ; @entity83 and @entity84 reportedly came in the mid- 1990s ; @entity85 and @entity86 in 1999 ; @entity87 in 2001			0
@entity18 - @entity7 relations were very different when @entity89 dispatched these officers			1
the @entity96 and @entity97 wars , @entity92 enlargement into @entity93 and @entity7 weapons sales to @entity54 were roiling the waters in the 1990s			2
@entity99 seems to have calculated that with these agents in place , there was little reason to pull them out , even if relations with @entity0 were on the upswing			2
what is surprising about this case is how many illegals were apparently operating together and how little they accomplished or were likely to accomplish			0
during the @entity110 , the heyday of this technique , the @entity109 typically dispatched such agents singly or as couples			0
they were usually compartmented from one another , not in networks of 10 or more , since all of them would be vulnerable if there was a single security slip - up			0
the @entity39 also used illegals mainly for assignments too difficult for @entity109 officers working under " official cover " as diplomats or attach√©s			0
it 's not clear what , if anything , these new accused illegals were able to do to steal sensitive information or even help other agents			1
maybe the @entity131 will reveal more on that , but at the moment , this operation looks like a waste of effort on @entity99 's part , indeed an embarrassment to its intelligence service			0
will this spy flap seriously damage @entity18 - @entity7 relations ? the early signs are that it will not			1
@entity7 prime minister @entity146 , himself a former @entity109 officer , has said that he hopes the incident will not damage the improving relations between the two countries			1
the @entity150 said it intends to focus on other things			0
the @entity18 , of course , can not be expected to like the fact that @entity7 spies on us , and is briefly entitled to a modest amount of indignation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0

@entity160 says arrests this week of *suspected* agents in @entity7 spy ring no surprise
espionage fills vital niche , he says , providing information about plans , human dynamics
accused spies appear to have *gathered* little information , he says
@entity160 : early signs are incident wo *n't* damage improving relations between two countries
