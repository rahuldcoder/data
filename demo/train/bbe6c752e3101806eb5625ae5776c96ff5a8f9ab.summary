-- hidden high among the forested volcanoes of @entity3 , the mountain gorilla was unknown to science until 1902 , when two were first encountered by a @entity6 explorer -- and promptly killed			1
it set the tone for the relationship			0
for much of the time since , due to deforestation and poaching , it has seemed the mountain gorilla was swiftly destined to be lost to the world again			2
not long after the species ' greatest champion , the @entity18 zoologist @entity17 , was killed in @entity21 in 1985 , there were fewer than 300 of the giant primates left in the wild			1
these days , however , while the species remains endangered , their numbers have grown to nearly 800			1
this is due to the efforts of conservationists such as those working in @entity31 , in northwest @entity21 , where @entity17 established a research center which continues to run in her name today			1
efforts to change attitudes towards the mighty animals have seen them become an important source of income for the local economy through the tourists they bring , and turned poachers into vocal advocates for conservation			2
the world 's largest mountain gorilla population , thought to number less than 500 animals , is found in a mountainous region known as the @entity49 , incorporating @entity50 , @entity52 's @entity51 , and @entity53 in the @entity54			1
a second , smaller population can be found in the @entity56 , in another region of @entity52			2

@entity64 , its gorilla program coordinator , said she developed the desire to work in her field after seeing " @entity68 , " the 1988 film which popularized @entity17 's story			1
" studying @entity17 , it 's really clear how one person can really make the difference , " said @entity64			1
" it 's what inspired me			0
" staff at @entity59 , which have observed the animals for more than 40 years , study the behavior of 10 groups of gorillas -- including those initially named and studied by @entity17 , and their offspring			1
@entity64 said the center focused on new research topics every year -- it had been able to learn , for example , that the life expectancy of a mountain gorilla was 35 years , as the animals had been under observation for their entire lifespan			2
@entity17 had believed in preserving the gorillas ' isolation by keeping tourists away			2
but today the tourism generated by the gorillas is essential to the local economy , and the organization that carries @entity17 's name is in favor of the visitors			1
" it 's thanks ( to ) gorilla tourism that the gorillas are so well protected here in @entity21 , " said @entity64			1
" i 'm sure that if she was still there now , she would just appreciate the fact that thanks to the tourists , the gorilla ( gets ) to be alive			0
before it was her keeping the gorillas alive , and now it 's the tourism			2
" @entity17 was found murdered in her cabin in the @entity116 in 1985 , and is buried in the park			2
her killer has never been found			0

they have also been killed for their body parts to be sold to collectors			0
@entity129 grew up in the area and used to hunt in the park			0
the former poacher says the last animal he killed was about eight years ago -- these days he urges people to protect the park 's animals as part of their livelihood			0
" we used to live near this volcanic park , depending on it , " he said			0
" at that time , we were very poor ... we were relying on the park to get the meat			0
" he said he and fellow poachers were persuaded to change their ways due to education programs from government agencies			0
" in order to stop all this ... poaching , deforestation or any other illegal activities , it was a combined effort of the @entity154 and the current @entity155 ( @entity155 ) , " he said			0
" the @entity155 met us and gave us a plan of action and showed us how we can live without poaching in the parks			0
" @entity64 said one of the amazing things about studying mountain gorillas was how close the primates let observers come to them , compared to other species she had studied			1
" i started with western lowland gorillas , and the top distance was 50 meters to have them doing their activities , " she said			0
" but here you can approach a gorilla very close , and they ignore your presence ... you can be there and just be a natural part of the forest and collect your data			0

there are only 800 mountain gorillas , found across two *habitats* in @entity3
the species is endangered , but their numbers are growing due to conservation efforts
@entity21 's @entity59 was founded by the late zoologist @entity17
her *mission* continues there , with some gorillas she named still under observation
