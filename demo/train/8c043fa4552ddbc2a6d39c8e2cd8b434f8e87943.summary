-- since " @entity2 , " reclusive filmmaker @entity4 's fifth film in four decades , premiered at @entity5 earlier this week , the 2Â½ - hour long impressionistic tone poem has elicited mixed reactions ranging from scattered boos to walkouts to long standing ovations			1
when the film took the coveted @entity12 at the end of the festival , the buzz was deafening			1
so what 's the big deal ? let 's get the things we already know about the ambitious film out of the way first : it stars @entity23 as a stern but ultimately disappointed father of three boys in 1950s @entity26 , @entity27 as his luminescent wife and @entity29 as one of their grown - up sons many years later ; there is little in the way of linear narrative or dialogue outside of breathy voiceovers contemplating the existence and disposition of @entity40 ; there are lengthy sequences of volcanoes erupting , cells dividing and many other awe - inspiring natural phenomena that recall both " @entity46 " and " 2001 : @entity47 " ; and , yes , there are @entity50 dinosaurs			1
a tough sell to be sure , especially for @entity51 who would rather stick with the familiar territory of " @entity54 " or " @entity55 " than a meditation on how the lives of this family coincide with the birth of the entire universe ( enter the dinosaurs ) , but stay with me			2
what the film lacks in traditional box office appeal , it more than makes up for in stunning visual effects and a unique , poetic perspective on family , faith , loss of innocence and reconciliation that will stay with you long after you may finish scratching your head at the film 's conclusion			1
the complaints about " @entity2 " center around the fact that while some plot and conflict is established , nothing ever really happens			1
it 's more or less true , but it misses the point			0
in as spiritually minded a movie as " @entity2 , " it only makes sense that the journey would be the destination			0
or , as the film 's stars put it at a press conference in @entity5 : " it 's like ( @entity4 ) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day , " @entity23 said			1
" it 's all about capturing an accident , " @entity95 added			0
" he would be shooting and @entity23 would be wonderful and then there 'd be a woodpecker nearby and he 'd turn to that			1
you ca n't plan any moment			0
" for a viewer , this so - called aimlessness may sound frustrating , but @entity4 is nothing if not meticulous			1
he juxtaposes explosive imagery and a soaring operatic score with smaller , tender moments like natural light shining through blades of grass and a baby 's first steps to create the complete mood and mosaic of " @entity2			0
" ultimately , that is this film 's strength			2
in a move that rankled many at @entity5 , @entity4 declined to do any press and was only on hand unexpectedly and briefly at the @entity122 to premiere the film			2
@entity23 described the absence as the auteur 's preference to focus on " building a house , not selling the real estate			1
" still , with a movie that raises more questions than it answers , the public wanted @entity4 's help interpreting the film			2
we say just see it			0
and then maybe see it again			0
it 's a work of art to experience and behold , but do n't try too hard to dissect it , because the whole does n't always live up to the sum of its extraordinary parts			0
have you seen " @entity2 " ? tell us what you thought in the comments			0
" @entity2 " is open in limited release in @entity147 and @entity148 , with wide release on july 8 .			0

the film stars @entity23 as a stern , disappointed father of three boys in 1950s @entity26
@entity29 plays one of his grown - up sons many years later
while some plot and conflict is established , nothing ever really happens , is one complaint
