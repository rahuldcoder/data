" murder is the deprivation of life , " culinary mystery author @entity9 said			1
" talking about food is life - affirming			2
when i read the @entity16 novels by @entity17 , i noticed that when @entity16 was thinking about a case , he would often prepare a meal			1
cooking provided a way for him to reflect on the case			1
" @entity23 can relate to cooking as therapy that fuels for the writing process			1
when planning out the plots for her @entity30 catering mysteries , @entity23 finds relaxation in her kitchen , simultaneously coming up with recipes to include in the books			1
" food is a very powerful mnemonic , " culinary mystery author @entity36 said			1
" we remember what we eat from childhood , and we have a very positive association with food			2
then you pair it with crime , and it provides a twist			2
you have the comfort of food , then , what 's going on here ? it gives an element of surprise , of suspense			1
poison only further complicates , of course			0
" for @entity60 , author of the @entity62 mysteries , food is the comfort - aspect in her books			1
readers eager to try " cozy mysteries , " rather than thriller or suspense novels , psychologically take comfort in the inclusion of food			1
" while we 're writing about murder , we 're really writing about everyday life , " @entity60 said			1
" murder is something extraordinary that happens in the everyday lives of our characters			1

" half - @entity81 and half - @entity82 , @entity60 took inspiration from where she grew up			0
" food plays such a big part in small - town life , " @entity60 said			0
" where else but the @entity89 are you served a @entity90 with crushed pretzels and strawberries ? i keep a tradition of trying to include family recipes that match the flavor of the book			2
" food is already a basis for relationships in society , a way of connecting to one another or identifying personality traits based on what we eat , @entity60 said			0
toss in a whodunit murder , and people ca n't help but be intrigued			2
regional dishes and flavors also add a twist by either reconnecting readers with their childhood favorites or introducing them to new food cultures			0
culinary mysteries combine all the right ingredients for a sumptuous puzzle : quirky amateur sleuths , elements of danger and a fabulous array of food set in locations with a cast of colorful characters			1
these authors of " traditional " and " cozy " mysteries know that including food also works to reassure readers			2
justice will win out in the end , @entity36 said			0
" i 'm not going to leave you with a bleak view of the universe , and there 's good food along the way			0
" authors are inspired to write culinary mysteries because they already enjoy cooking			1
" the elements of writing crime are like a recipe , " @entity36 said			0
" you have all the ingredients , or clues , and then follow step - by - step how to put them together			0
you stick it in the oven , which is the mystery , and then out comes a cake , or your resolution			0
" whether on vacation or needing to unwind from a hectic workday , many women know they can pick up a culinary mystery and lose themselves in the comfort or even sensuality of when food and murder come together			1
they witness glimpses of their own lives while partaking of the extraordinary			0
" the overwhelming majority of mystery readers are women , " said @entity160 , a senior executive editor of the @entity162 publishing group			0
" they see their own lives reflected in these characters			0
they 're baking cookies for their kids or church benefits and reading about people that do the same thing , so they get that sense of identification			0
" readers may be comforted by the food while reading about unacceptable violence			0
" it 's an interesting combination , death , food and murder , " dr. @entity181 , a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst specializing in mourning , said			1
" @entity188 is not that simple , it involves a lot of issues about aggression			2
comfort food can momentarily take away feelings that are frightening or have aggression in them			1
" " when it is on a visceral level , that 's when something like a rich food can alleviate the toxicity of that feeling , but it 's only a temporary fix			0
it sounds like these ( culinary mysteries ) are using food to counteract something about the fears of rage that are expressed as actual murder			1
" many writers who mix their murders with a good meal cite the well - fed character in the @entity215 mystery books that later became tv series			1
a @entity215 fan , @entity36 published her first culinary mystery in 1989			1
the food in this genre of mystery sets each series apart : cheese , bakeshop , pizza , tea and @entity228 chef mysteries			2
" i think what 's new are the types that tickle people 's imaginations , " @entity160 said			0
" people are reading for entertainment , and while they do , they have a nice plate of cookies and an iced tea by their side			0
" what comes first , the perfect crime or the perfect recipe ? like @entity23 , @entity36 and @entity60 , @entity243 , author of the @entity245 series , develops her recipes while she 's working on each book , constantly tweaking until the last minute so they turn out just so , she said			2
like her sleuth working through a puzzle , recipe tweaking is trial and error			0
" trying to solve a murder is much like trying to come up with a good recipe , " @entity243 said			2
" you have to try a little of this , a little of that , and see how it all comes together			0
" the inclusion of recipes in the backs of books also became a popular aspect for readers			1
in the beginning , @entity36 did n't include them , but when readers began requesting recipes by mail , @entity36 knew it was time to share them with everyone			2
but for the amount of time these novels have been popular , why the sudden boom ? " culinary mysteries are here to stay , " @entity160 said			1
" it 's taken a long time for women mystery writers and cozy mystery writers to get the respect of the mystery genre community			2
they kind of forced their way in the door , so it became hard to ignore			0
" page , also author of " @entity289 in your kitchen , " a collection of recipes based on those in her @entity296 series , uses a quote from a @entity299 in the late 1800s at the beginning of her cookbook to describe the relationship between murder and food			1
