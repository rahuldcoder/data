-- if you 're going to break hearts , at least be classy about it			2
yes , " @entity5 " star @entity4 is engaged to director and actress @entity7 -- cue the crying emojis from some fans on @entity10 -- but the actor revealed the news in a refreshingly humble way			1
instead of releasing a statement through an army of publicists or posting a photo of engagement rings on @entity19 , @entity4 went old - school and posted an engagement notice in the wednesday edition of @entity24 paper @entity23			1
the six - line notice under " forthcoming marriages " is so straightforward , it would be easy to read past it before realizing that it 's taking about the @entity4 : " the engagement is announced between @entity4 , son of @entity32 and @entity33 of @entity34 , and @entity7 , daughter of @entity35 of @entity36 and @entity37 of @entity34			1
" the lack of fanfare is n't unusual for @entity4 , 38 , and @entity37 , 36 , as they 've kept their romance under the radar			1
the couple , who met on the set of the 2009 movie " @entity47 , " were n't seen together publicly until the @entity48 this year			0
still , the news of a @entity4 wedding is a tough pill to swallow for some admirers			1
as his star rose with roles in " @entity56 " and " @entity57 , " the charming actor has become an international heartthrob			0
@entity10 has ( predictably ) gone into mourning : " @entity60 ( @entity61 )			2
now @entity4 , " tweeted one fan			2
" it 's a cruel , cruel world ... " " @entity64 wishes to # @entity65 and # @entity66			0
may you live happily ever after , " said another			0
" now excuse me while i cry a river			0
" according to the @entity71 , the couple has yet to set a wedding date .			0

@entity4 is engaged to @entity7
the couple revealed the news with a *simple* newspaper notice
on @entity10 , there 's been a string of broken hearts
