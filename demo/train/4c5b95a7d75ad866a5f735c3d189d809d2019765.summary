-- some people take many years to find their calling in life -- but for @entity5 , it was right in front of him in black and white			1
on a small section of his local newspaper , the @entity8 boy who would become an @entity10 champion saw his future flash before him			1
an advert , in the otherwise unremarkable @entity15 , had caught his mother 's eye			2
it was calling out for the next kayak superstar -- and her son had already tried everything else without much success			2
" it was one of those turning points in your life where you look back and you 're like , ' wow that day really changed the rest of my life quite significantly , ' " @entity5 told @entity0 's human to @entity24			1
" it was a long time ago now			0
i wonder what would have happened with me and where i 'd be today if instead of that newspaper article , my mum was reading something different or brought me down to another sports club ? or did n't at all ? i think about that a lot			2
" as a 13 - year - old who had tried his hand at a whole host of sports including soccer , basketball and volleyball , it was the kayak which caught the imagination of a determined teenager			1
after his first foray into the world of paddling , there was never a chance he 'd turn back			2
" every kid wants to have something to brag about			0
i tried out for all the teams growing up but i just was n't really showing any signs of any athletic prowess , " @entity5 said			1
" in kayaking it was the sort of a thing i could go out there and practice on my own			0
it took a lot of concentration			0
" unknown quantity some 18 years have passed since he first picked up a paddle , but van @entity5 has lost none of the boyish enthusiasm which propelled him from an unknown to one of the sport 's most famous stars			1
from arriving as a virtual unknown at the @entity77 , where he won gold in the @entity80 500 - meter event and bronze in the @entity80 1,000 - meter race , he went on to establish himself as an icon of the sport			1
but even now , with four @entity10 medals , two @entity87 wins and 26 @entity89 stage victories to his name , van @entity5 is still desperate for more success			1
the opportunity to compete at @entity93 in 2016 is a huge lure for the man who grew up dreaming of the day he would compete at the greatest games on earth			1
and at the age of 31 , that dream still remains -- perhaps burning even stronger			2
@entity100 " i 've definitely committed to @entity93 , " he said			1
" i 'm training like i 'm training for the @entity10 , and it 's just difficult committing to something that 's so far away			1
" i really have enjoyed the process of diversification and trying new things but i ca n't really get away from the fact that i 'm a kayaker and i love to race , and there 's a big race happening in @entity111 in a couple of years ' time			0
" i 'm not going to be too old for it			0
i do n't want to retire ... but i do n't want to be washed up			0
i do n't want to be the old guy on the water			0
" i do n't want to think about retirement and i hope the next phase of my life is just as rewarding and provides me with the same opportunity to work hard			0
" climbing peaks @entity122 has stood on top of the world -- in more ways than one -- but he has not lost sight of the smaller things in life			2
the man who walked into @entity133 's @entity132 stadium holding the @entity134 aloft in 2008 is now busy flying the flag for children across the world who can only dream of becoming a @entity10 hero			1
in november last year , @entity5 climbed @entity138 in @entity139 for charity @entity140			1
by ascending the world 's tallest freestanding mountain -- its peak is 5,895 meters ( 19,336 feet ) above sea level -- he and six others helped to raise over $ 100,000 for children across the world			0
the scheme runs a whole host of educational programs which include seminars on @entity151 and @entity152 , conflict resolution , healthy active living , sanitation and cleanliness			0
@entity122 proudly sports a " right to play " sticker on his kayak -- something which he is often asked about			0
" when i 'm racing my boat in @entity162 people always ask me , ' is that like a gaming site , are they like your sponsors ? ' " it 's a good conversation starter because they do n't know it 's a charity that i do some work with			0
" they 're a children - focused charity that is helping to improve lives for those who are n't fortunate enough to be able to say that they can take sport and play for granted			1
" unfortunately it 's not something everybody globally can take for granted			0
" when i was 13 , i just wandered into a canoe club and had access to a competitive sport with great coaching and great facility			1
" that 's just not available to everybody , so it 's great that the @entity140 to play is bridging that gap and leveling the playing field			0
" a bigger picture despite a hectic competition schedule and his constant traveling , the opportunity to help others remains a driving force for @entity5			1
" it comes down to priorities , " he added			0
" i 'm tremendously fortunate to be able to do a sport for my living and be a full - time athlete , so any spare time that i have , i should be able to devote to these sorts of efforts			2
" it 's easy to turn a blind eye or forget when you 're so focused on moving a kayak , like how obscure that is and how selfish it is in the long run because , really , i ca n't think of a more selfish sport			2
" i 'm in a little boat all by myself out on the water paddling as fast i can every single day just so i can go and win a kayak race			2
" while i feel very fortunate , i also know there 's a bigger picture and there 's other things out there that we need to consider and if i can be a part of that then i will			0
