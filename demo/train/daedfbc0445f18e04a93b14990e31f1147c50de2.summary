-- blaming the moon is a popular pastime			0
police say crime rates go up during a full moon , nurses claim birth rates go up , authors set werewolves and vampires loose upon the land , and people think craziness abounds -- witness the word " lunatic , " which derives from " luna , " the @entity17 word for moon			0
none of this moon - linked strangeness has ever stood up to serious scrutiny			0
but now a team of astronomers at @entity25 has suggested that the moon can be blamed for the sinking of the @entity27 on its maiden voyage 100 years ago			1
how the moon caused icebergs to litter the @entity27 's path , on april 14 , 1912 , is really a story about the @entity34 's tides			1
what we now know about where icebergs originate and how they travel could have informed the @entity27 's crew and perhaps avoided tragedy			0
but at the time , this science was in its infancy			0
the @entity27 's captain did not expect icebergs to be a problem -- rarely did ice travel so far south into the @entity47			0
yet contemporaneous warnings from other ships suggested there were an unusual number of icebergs			0
passengers reported seeing ice floes , lookouts spotted ice and sounded warnings , and other ships in the area reported fields of ice near the disaster site			0
here 's where astronomy comes in : three months earlier , on january 4 , 1912 , the closest approach of the moon to the @entity34 in 1,400 years occurred within one day of the @entity34 's closest approach to the sun ( which occurs once per year ) , all within minutes of a full moon , meaning the sun was perfectly aligned on the other side of the @entity34 ( this happens every couple of weeks )			1
the odds of all three events occurring at once are , well , astronomical			0
this lineup had to have caused unusually high tides in the @entity47			1
tides are caused mostly by the differential pull of the moon 's gravity on the @entity34			1
the pull is strongest on the near side and weakest on the far side , since the strength of gravity , as @entity86 told us four centuries ago , falls as the square of the distance between the two massive objects -- in this case , the @entity34 and the moon			2
that is , the moon pulls hardest on the @entity34 's oceans on the side facing the moon , making a bulge of water ( high tide )			1
it pulls less hard on the @entity34 , but even less hard on the water on the far side , so a watery bulge forms on the far side as well -- a high tide roughly 12 hours out of synch			1
the overall strength of the moon 's gravity , as well as its differential ( tidal ) effect , is greatest when the moon is closest to the @entity34 , as on january 4 , 1912			1
now consider the sun. it is much more massive than the moon or @entity34 but also much farther away			2
the absolute pull of the sun 's gravity is far greater than the pull of the moon -- that 's why we 're orbiting the sun , after all , rather than the moon -- but the sun does not exert much of a tidal force on the @entity34 ( that is , a stronger force on the @entity34 's near side than its far side ) because , compared to the distance between the sun and @entity34 , the @entity34 's size is miniscule			1
try this analogy ( thanks to @entity128 ) : if the @entity34 were the size of a basketball , the moon would be a tennis ball about 24 feet away , and the @entity131 would be like a house nearly two miles away			2
to the sun , the @entity34 is a tiny speck : its diameter is less than 0.01 % of the @entity34 - sun distance			2
but the size of the @entity34 is a few percent of the distance to the moon , which translates to about a 7 % stronger gravitational pull on the near side of the @entity34 than the far side			2
that 's why the moon dominates the @entity34 's tides			1
still , when the sun lines up perfectly on the opposite side of the @entity34 from the moon , as it did on january 4 , 1912 , it increases the tidal effect slightly			1
and the fact that the sun and moon were particularly close to the @entity34 at precisely the same time -- well , that made the tidal bulges even bigger			1
what does this have to do with icebergs ? the @entity156 scientists pointed out that normally , icebergs move south from @entity158 in fits and starts , frequently grounding in the shallow waters off @entity162 and @entity163			0
but unusually high tides in january 1912 meant the icebergs did n't get stuck			1
instead , they kept moving south , arriving in much greater numbers than usual in the path of the @entity27			0
maybe the @entity27 's captain had reason to believe reports of excessive ice were wrong -- such conditions were , after all , not the norm			0
but he did n't reckon on the inexorable pull of gravity from @entity34 's nearest celestial neighbor			2
this is the real lunar influence on our lives : gravity and tides , not werewolves and pregnant women			0
one thing this new theory predicts : there should be records of exceptionally high tides near @entity163 in january 1912			1
this is the hallmark of a proper theory : it makes predictions that can then be tested			0
so , history buffs , marine historians , tell us : does this theory hold water ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

a study by astronomers says the moon 's position may have had a role in titanic sinking
@entity200 : an unusual lineup of the @entity34 , sun , moon in january 1912 would have *boosted* tide
she says higher tides could have floated icebergs into the route of the *oceanliner*
@entity200 : if theory is true , there should be evidence of *extreme* high tide
