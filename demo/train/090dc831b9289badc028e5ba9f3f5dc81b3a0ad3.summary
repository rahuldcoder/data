@entity0 -- on @entity3 , the beginning of this year will look a lot like the end of last year			1
the fight over extending a payroll tax cut and long - term unemployment benefits picks back up tuesday as @entity9 returns to work after its winter break			1
while aides in both parties say it 's likely @entity9 will resolve that dispute , @entity11 are still licking their wounds after a public backlash over how they handled those issues and fear that @entity19 will drag out the fight to score more political points in an election year			1
and @entity19 are concerned that @entity23 @entity11 will insist on adding more items to the measures to try to keep conservatives on board			2
the presidential campaign will take center stage this year			1
president @entity30 already has made clear he plans to run against a " do - nothing " @entity9 and will likely highlight that theme during the annual @entity32 address next week			1
facing that high - profile push against them , and with congressional approval ratings in the single digits and the fight for control of both chambers in the balance , lawmakers know they have a heavy lift to convince voters they deserve re-election			1
democrats , who run the @entity19 , and @entity11 , who control the @entity23 , acknowledge that outside of the payroll tax cut bill no major legislation is expected to make it through @entity9 this year			1
however , each party promises a series of bills to advance what it thinks the public wants from @entity3 in response to the weak economy			0
for both sides , these efforts will be more about political messaging than actually legislating because few , if any , are likely to become law			0
congressional tensions this week @entity63 will huddle at their annual three - day retreat in @entity65 to map out their 2012 agenda and strategy for responding to president @entity30 and @entity9 @entity19			1
but high on the agenda at that meeting for @entity23 speaker @entity71 is likely to be an effort to bridge severe divisions with his own rank - and - file , many of whom questioned his leadership over the course of several showdowns with the @entity23 and @entity19 last year			1
conservatives want @entity71 to be more aggressive in standing for their principles			0
tensions between @entity19 and @entity11 are also high			0
the president 's decision earlier this month to make a recess appointment of @entity88 to head the @entity89 while the @entity9 was technically not recessed drew a swift and angry response from @entity11			1
@entity92 aides privately grumbled the move set a bad tone for the coming year and invited @entity11 to be even less cooperative			1
and with key economic nominees needing @entity19 confirmation , including a new director of @entity98 after @entity99 was named @entity23 chief of staff , @entity11 could cause problems for the president and @entity19 democrats			1
senate majority leader @entity104 said sunday on @entity106 's " @entity105 " that @entity9 spent months on issues unnecessarily last year , pointing out that president @entity108 raised the debt ceiling 18 times while in the @entity23			1
" we 've had obstructionism on steroids , " @entity104 said			0
a top @entity19 @entity115 leadership aide said the party is n't overly concerned			0
that 's because @entity19 believe @entity92 obstructionism is at such a high level now -- where filibusters are routine -- they already expect a major fight on every nominee			1
finishing the payroll tax cut bill when @entity9 limped out of town before @entity126 , it agreed to a two - month extension of a bill that cuts payroll taxes , extends unemployment benefits and prevents a cut in the rate paid to doctors who care for @entity135 patients			1
as they begin talks on an extension for the rest of 2012 , both sides remain highly skeptical and suspicious of each other			0
questions linger for congressional negotiators -- how to pay for the $ 200 billion price tag and whether to tighten requirements for unemployment benefits			1
@entity19 are worried @entity11 will push for other issues , such as renewing their demand for the approval of the controversial @entity150 oil pipeline or the elimination of a range of @entity154 regulations on businesses			0
some in the @entity92 are wary the @entity23 and @entity19 @entity19 will try again to pass a surtax on millionaires -- something even some @entity19 do n't support -- as a way of painting the @entity92 as protectors of the rich			0
" the only way this process will not go smoothly and through regular order is if the @entity23 chooses to disrupt it for political reasons , " said @entity162 , spokesman for @entity23 speaker @entity71			0
informal discussions between @entity23 and @entity19 negotiators have already begun			0
@entity104 told " @entity105 " that he hopes the @entity171 faction in the @entity23 does n't have the same influence on talks that it did in december 's impasse , calling that " bad for the country			2
" " i would hope the two @entity11 leaders would have learned from what took place in the previous year , " @entity104 said			2
debt ceiling again right out of the gate when @entity9 returns , lawmakers will have to respond formally to the president 's recent request to raise the debt ceiling			1
as part of the choreography agreed to last summer , members will get a chance to vote against the president 's request , but it 's mostly for show because the reality is @entity9 does n't have the votes to block an increase			1
two other significant bills need attention this winter			0
one is a new @entity199 bill that is stalled over disputes on labor rights and a costly government program to subsidize air travel to rural areas			0
senators also want to pass a highway bill that would fund road and bridge construction for the next two years			0
@entity30 is supposed to formally submit his budget for 2013 in february			0
last year , republicans criticized his budget for failing to reform entitlement programs like @entity135 and @entity213 , which represent the bulk of the nation 's massive budget deficit			1
" if he punts again , it will be clear the @entity23 plans to spend the year on autopilot			1
we think that would be unacceptable to the @entity223 people , " @entity71 's aide said			2
on the @entity150 matter , the administration already is facing a congressionally mandated deadline on february 21 to approve the project or explain why it wo n't			0
@entity19 say they expect the @entity23 to reject the plan -- because the administration has said it ca n't finish its environmental review by then -- but @entity11 are promising to continue to hammer the administration on the issue			0
bills to help the economy and send a message to voters in addition to their push for @entity150 , @entity23 @entity11 are planning votes early this year on legislation that would expand domestic energy production and upgrade transportation infrastructure across the country			2
the bill will include offshore drilling , energy exploration in the @entity247 ( @entity247 ) , as well as give money to states along with more flexibility to build roads and bridges			0
the new spending on highway projects would be offset by revenue from oil and gas leases			0
but the @entity23 is unlikely to support the @entity92 proposals and they are unlikely to go anywhere in the @entity115 - led @entity19			2
even without much hope for actually passing these bills @entity23 @entity11 aides stress they will continue focusing on measures to boost the weak economy to show they are responding to voters ' concerns , and they emphasize that many of these proposals have had @entity115 support			0
" @entity273 is going to continue to work hard to produce results for small businesses , working families and middle class @entity223 , " one @entity23 @entity92 aide told @entity1			0
" if the president wishes to ignore @entity9 and play political games , that 's his decision , but by doing so he will own the gridlock , " the aide said			1
in addition to the bills on jobs , the @entity23 also is expected to take up legislation to make more transparent members of @entity9 ' stock trades and other financial transactions			2
@entity92 leaders plan to vote on the so - called " @entity291 " which would ban lawmakers from using any non-public information to trade stocks or make other financial transactions			1
@entity19 want to draw a line to job creation with almost everything they do this year			2
that starts with the highway and @entity199 bills , which @entity19 say will create thousands of jobs			0
it will then continue all year with a myriad of bills @entity19 think will prove to a wary public they are putting jobs first			2
a measure to fund school construction is another example of a bill @entity19 hope to highlight			0
lawmakers from both parties say they are determined before the end of the year to prevent deep cuts to the defense budget as called for after the deficit reduction " super committee " failed to reach a deal to slash the deficit			2
aides said serious work to find alternative spending reductions probably wo n't happen until after the election in november			2
control of @entity9 as voters go to the polls this year , members are expected to spend less time in @entity0 and more time in their districts making the case for why their party ought to be steering the country 's economic agenda			1
@entity19 need to pick up 25 seats to regain control of the @entity23 -- a high hurdle , but one many democrats feel is within reach because they think voters will blame @entity11 for the gridlock in @entity0			1
@entity19 @entity11 feel more confident they can win control of their chamber , especially after the retirements of several key @entity115 senators in states that lean @entity11			0
right now the @entity19 hold a 53 - 47 advantage			2
but @entity19 are defending 23 seats this year while republicans are working to hold just 10			2
the recent announcement by sen. @entity351 , a conservative @entity352 from @entity353 , that he would not seek re-election is seen by @entity11 as another sign @entity19 will lose majority control .			0
