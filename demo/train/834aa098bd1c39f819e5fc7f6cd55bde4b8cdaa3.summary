hours later , in northern @entity1 's @entity5 region , six other @entity6 suspects -- ages 25 - 31 -- were arrested , @entity10 said			1
police suspect @entity20 replaced the suspected @entity6 military chief who was arrested last december and who , in turn , had replaced the alleged @entity6 military chief who was arrested last november , @entity10 said			0
those arrests occurred in @entity8 , from where @entity6 has launched a number of attacks into @entity1			1
@entity6 is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its more than four decades of fighting for @entity5 independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the @entity32 and the @entity33			1
@entity10 said police had also dismantled two @entity6 commando cells before they could strike , one of them last october in northern @entity1 's @entity38 province , and the other late saturday , when the six suspects were arrested			1
@entity20 's arrest came after police trailed an alleged @entity6 local leader from @entity1 to a meeting in @entity8 with @entity20 for a two - hour training session on the use of explosives and weapons , @entity10 said			1
police made the arrests in @entity8 right after the meeting , before the alleged local leader could return to @entity1 to share those details with his alleged commando cells , @entity10 said			0
police seized three pistols , two vehicles , and a small quantity of explosives from @entity20 and the two others arrested in @entity8 , @entity10 said			0

@entity20 is the fifth @entity6 suspect arrested in @entity8 in the past two weeks			0
given the heavy police crackdown , @entity10 said investigators have noted some internal discussion among @entity6 members about whether they should continue their armed fight or try for a negotiated end to the violence			0
but he said the government , which held failed peace talks with @entity6 under three prime ministers since the 1980s , was no longer willing to negotiate			0
" the process of dialogue is the past , and the past never returns , " @entity10 said , adding that @entity6 would have to decide to end the violence itself , or the state would force the group to end it			0
over the past two years , police in @entity1 and @entity8 have arrested 365 @entity6 suspects , @entity1 prime minister @entity85 said in december			2
but top @entity1 officials have repeatedly warned that @entity6 , while weakened , is not finished			2
