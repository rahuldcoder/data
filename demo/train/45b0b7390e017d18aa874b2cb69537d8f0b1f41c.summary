@entity0 -- it may be the biggest salvage operation in history , but no one would accuse it of being the fastest			0
now , two and a half years after running aground and sinking off the coast of @entity8 , the @entity6 cruise liner is almost ready to make its final voyage			1
if everything goes to plan , over the next couple of weeks the rotting 951 - foot vessel will be re-floated and towed north from the @entity14 island of @entity15 -- its resting place since it capsized in january 2012 , killing 32 passengers and crew in the process -- to the port in @entity21 to be dismantled			1
but let 's not get ahead of ourselves			0
there 's a lot of work to do before this decaying husk of a ship is back out on the open seas , and there 's a lot that could go wrong in the meantime			2
@entity1 contributor @entity33 is writing a book about the @entity6 , so we asked her to break down the big questions for us			1
what 's happening now ? before the @entity6 can be towed away , it first has to be re-floated			1
that process starts monday , when crews will attempt to lift the 114,000 - tonne ship off of the underwater platforms that it 's been resting on since it was " parbuckled , " or rolled upright , last year			1
the re-floating process will take around five days			0
30 huge steel hollow boxes , or sponsons , attached to either side of the @entity6 are being pumped full of compressed air to give the ship buoyancy			1
crews raised the ship two meters in the first six hours monday before moving the ship off of its underwater platforms			2
crews will now check it for fissures , clean it and attach the flotation devices on each side together under the bottom of the boat with giant chains and cables , creating a false bottom			2
workers will then raise the decaying cruise liner one deck at a time by pumping more air into the sponsons			0
each deck will take approximately six hours to raise and clean			0
once they 've raised the @entity6 three decks above water , @entity14 environmental officials will inspect it for leaks			2
then it 's tow time			0
when will it be towed and how long will it take ? with 60,000 tonnes of salvage gear attached to its 114,000 tonne frame , the @entity6 is n't exactly a speedboat			2
traveling at a maximum speed of two knots ( 2.3 miles per hour ) , it will take about five days to tow the ship to @entity21 , roughly 200 miles north of @entity15			1
it could happen as early as july 18th , but only if the weather grants the salvage team a clear five - day forecast			0
it 's just too risky to attempt to tow the decomposing liner through anything less than calm waters			0
the ship 's been upright since september			0
what 's taken so long ? weather has accounted for a number of delays			0
it was september 2013 ( more than 18 months after it sank ) by the time the stricken vessel was rotated upright , and the ideal time to tow it away had already passed for the year			0
the @entity102 is at its most tranquil from mid-july to early august , so salvage crews spent the past 10 months making final preparations for this window of time			0
interactive : how the ship was tipped upright what does @entity109 have to say about this ? @entity109 has chartered a ship to monitor the @entity6 operation			1
the environmental group is concerned that the ship will leak a trail of toxins into the @entity102 during its five - day voyage to @entity21 , and says the fragile liner should be taken to @entity119 , a much closer port that could be reached in a single day			1
so why is the @entity6 going to @entity21 ? the port at @entity119 may be closer , but it would need to be dredged in order to be deep enough to take the @entity6			1
the port would n't be ready until the end of september , and by then the weather conditions would make @entity102 waters too choppy to navigate until this time next year			0
@entity128 , the firm that owns the @entity6 , also runs a large part of @entity21 's port			1
the company wants to bring what 's left of their former marquee ship back to their home port , rather than having to keep tabs on it from afar			2
@entity128 also wants to recycle intact parts of the ship -- engine components , plumbing structures , anything else that 's waterproof -- and use them in their other cruise liners			2
how long will it take to " recycle " the @entity6 ? it will take around 125 workers between 18 months and two and a half years			1
once the @entity6 's in @entity21 , crews will construct a giant tent over the ship and none of us will ever see it again			1
the front and the back will be dismantled first , and any possessions that passengers left behind as they fled the sinking liner will be returned to their owners			0
how much is this all going to cost ? @entity128 's @entity159 said the operation has already cost an eye - watering $ 1 billion , and will top $ 2 billion or more by the time it 's done			1
that 's more than three times the $ 612 million than it cost to build in 2004			2
what are the chances of the ship making it to @entity21 ? an optimistic 80 % , according to the salvage firm			1
the worst case scenario was that the ship could fall apart during the first six hours , but things appear to have gone well			0
the next biggest risk is that it could break while it 's being towed through the waters off the coast of @entity175 , which is where the @entity102 's currents are the strongest			0
is this the end of the story ? not at all			0
once the @entity6 leaves @entity15 , a company will come in to clean up the mess left by the salvage firms			1
@entity15 's residents , meanwhile , are debating whether to turn their new underwater salvage platforms into a dive attraction , or to tear them down			2
@entity128 is also being sued by dozens of survivors of the accident , and the @entity6 's captain , @entity188 , is on trial for manslaughter and abandoning ship			1

two and a half years after running aground in @entity15 , @entity8 , the @entity6 is being re-floated
32 passengers and crew were killed when the cruise ship capsized in january 2012
crews hope to re-float the @entity6 and tow it from @entity15 to the port in @entity21
dismantling the ship could take two years ; the total cost of the wreck is projected to be more than $ 2 billion
