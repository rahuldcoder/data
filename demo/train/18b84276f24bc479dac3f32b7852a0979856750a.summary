-- @entity1 has a lot of faith in her family 's " lucky " numbers			1
" i 've been playing , or around playing , the lotto all my life , " she says			2
she rattles off her numbers , citing family birthdays , and recounting numerical coincidences			2
" me , my husband , my father - in - law ... all our birthdays are in november			2
just a week apart from each other , " says @entity1 , 31			1
one number that did surprise her was $ 10,000			1
after some quick figuring , @entity17 estimates she has spent that amount on scratch off games and @entity20 since she started playing a decade ago			0
for @entity17 , a @entity22 , @entity23 , resident who works three jobs -- as a sales associate , an @entity26 and a bridal consultant -- that is a lot of money			0
" that ten grand could have gone toward a million and one bills i have -- my mortgage , car payments , " @entity1 says			1
" we spend thousands of dollars every month on bills			1
i do n't have kids either			0
that [ lotto ] money could have been a whole month for me for bills , " she says			0
but like a lot of people , @entity1 thinks $ 1 is a small price to pay for a dream			1
" you got ta play in order to win			0
that 's part of lotto			1
you never know , " says @entity1			1
one of the seductive features of the lotto is the low entry fee says @entity53 , a psychology professor at @entity54			1
" it can be exciting , checking those winning numbers , " says @entity53			1
" maybe something big might happen			0
there 's not a whole lot of other things in your life where you put a small amount of money in and maybe something big will happen			1
it gives you a sliver of hope that you could turn your life around			0
" and sometimes there are winners			0
@entity71 , is retired and living in @entity72 , @entity23			0
she has played lotto every day , spending $ 3 - $ 5 a day ( and more on tuesday ) for over 20 years			1
( just $ 4 a day for 20 years adds up to almost $ 30,000			1
) two years ago she won $ 100,000			1
and with that money she paid off her bills and did some remodeling on her second home in @entity79			0
oaks still buys lotto tickets , but she cautions that there 's always something else you can put the money towards			1
" i take care of things first , " she says			0
" food , rent -- then you can go out and spend a dollar on the lotto			0
" just do n't expect to win			0
let 's take @entity92 for example			1
your chances of winning the jackpot is one in 195,249,054 says @entity96 , a statistician and dean of business , math and science at @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103			1
let 's say you buy 50 @entity92 tickets a week , you 'll win the jackpot about once every 75,000 years , he says			1
cold , hard numbers aside , the lotto is entertainment			0
" almost everyone spends money on entertainment , " says @entity110 of the @entity111			0
" people spend hundreds of dollars going to a sports event			1
others spend a thousand dollars a year on premium cable channels			0
purchasing a lotto ticket -- it 's excitement and there 's always the possibility , however slim , that they will strike it rich and win , " he says			1
cost of fleeting excitement adds up @entity128 , 21 , of @entity129 , stood outside a lottery terminal one rainy friday night			2
she bought two scratch off tickets and a mega millions ticket			2
when asked what else she could be doing with that money , she laughs			0
" two dollars ? you ca n't buy anything for two dollars , " she says			2
but $ 2 a week is about $ 100 a year			2
and $ 100 can buy you something			1
the problem is opportunity costs , says @entity53			0
" what opportunities are lost because you are putting discretionary income into the lottery when you could be putting it into something else ? " he asks			2
" a small amount of money can be spent on dental floss , " he says			0
the lotto sends the wrong message , says @entity53			0
" it 's hard work versus chance			2
the lotto says success can be built on chance			0
" a 2005 study by the @entity111 says 38 percent of people with incomes below $ 25,000 think that winning the lottery represents the most practical way for them to accumulate several hundred thousand dollars			1
" lower income people think their chances of winning are slim			1
and they think that the probability [ for them to win ] is greater than being able to accumulate savings over time			0
the lotto advantage @entity169 , a professor at @entity170 , harnessed this idea that people would rather have a small probability of a large payout when he came up with the " save to win " idea			2
it 's part savings , part raffle ticket			1
and it 's had major success in @entity180 , @entity181 , where eight credit unions have been offering it since january			2
here 's how it works			2
you open up a one - year certificate of deposit and for every $ 25 you save , you get the chance to win a $ 100,000 prize			2
@entity190 , the director of @entity191 in @entity180 , @entity181 , says when his credit union offered a 10 percent interest rate on a one - year cd , no one signed on , but with @entity198 to win , 14 percent of their membership signed up			1
" i am surprised at the extent of the success			0
we really are showing people that they can afford to save , " he says			0
and in the very worst case even though someone may not win the grand prize , at least they 've already accumulated some savings			0
but when it comes to playing the real thing -- old habits die hard			0
" i 'm still going to buy my scratchoffs , " says @entity1			1
" i 'm not going to go cold turkey , " she says			0
" no way ! it 's too exciting ... knowing you have the chance to win			2
