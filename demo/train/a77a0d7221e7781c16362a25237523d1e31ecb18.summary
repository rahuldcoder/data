-- in august 2008 , @entity1 , an @entity2 , and two friends from his high school in @entity5 flew from @entity6 , @entity7 , to @entity8 , @entity9 , where they hoped to join the @entity11			2
in @entity8 , the trio met with " @entity13 , " an @entity15 operative who put them in touch with two @entity15 leaders			2
those leaders asked the three from @entity5 to participate in attacks against the @entity21			1
he wanted to fight the @entity21 military in the fields and mountains of his homeland , not to kill @entity21 civilians in the streets of his adopted country			0
so , according to @entity21 prosecutors , @entity15 's leaders brought in someone more persuasive -- someone who could speak to @entity1 in his own language , someone who had also grown up on the streets of @entity36 in the 1990s , a man who had had a meteoric rise in the ranks of @entity15 over the past decade from camp dishwasher to the leader of the group 's operations in the @entity44			1
eventually @entity46 would be added to the @entity48 's " @entity50 " list and a $ 5 million reward would be put on his head			1
and on saturday , @entity46 was killed in @entity9 by the @entity9 military			2
@entity46 was born in @entity53 in 1975 , but his family moved to @entity55 in the ' 80s and then to @entity57 in the early ' 90s			0
in 1995 , @entity46 's family left @entity36 for the @entity60 area in @entity61 , where he did odd jobs like selling used cars , earning money that he used to pay for his studies in chemistry and computer science at @entity68			2
some @entity70 men in @entity61 gave @entity72 books and videos about the holy wars in @entity75 and @entity76 , and he was so moved by these stories of holy war that in late 1999 he traveled to @entity76 to attend an @entity15 training camp			0
around this time , @entity46 told his mother that he was opposed to what he considered the excesses of the @entity44 , such as alcohol and drug abuse as well as the skimpy clothes that women wore in @entity61			0
in may 2001 , he left @entity61 again , and by june he was back in @entity76			0
shortly after the 9/11 attacks , @entity46 called his mother in @entity61 , saying , " did you hear what happened ? they are putting it on the @entity70			1
" his mother advised him not to come back to the @entity93 , and she said in 2010 he did not contact her again			0
it was @entity46 who , in late 2008 , made the pitch to @entity1 and his buddies from @entity5 -- @entity99 , another @entity2 , and @entity100 , a cab driver of @entity102 descent -- that they could help the cause of holy war best if , instead of fighting alongside the @entity11 's tens of thousands of fighters , they went back to the @entity21 after their training by @entity15 's bomb - makers and launched attacks there			1
at the time that @entity46 was making his pitch to the trio from @entity5 , the @entity113 drone war in the tribal regions of @entity9 was heating up			2
it was the last six months of president @entity117 's second term , and the @entity117 administration had significantly amped up the drone program			0
angered by the @entity113 drone program , @entity1 agreed to return to the @entity21 to launch an attack			0
he also volunteered to be a suicide bomber , as did his two friends			0
they discussed with @entity72 potential targets such as the @entity125 and @entity126 , as well as a @entity128 store			0
@entity1 returned to @entity36 in mid-january 2009			0
he had been living on the @entity76 - @entity9 border for five months , during which time he had been in almost continuous contact with members of @entity15			2
he was now ready to launch what @entity15 's leadership hoped would be the most lethal terrorist attack in the @entity21 since 9/11			1
luckily , @entity1 's plan to blow up bombs in the @entity138 subway around the time of the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks was detected by @entity21 intelligence agencies that were monitoring the email account of a known @entity15 operative in @entity9 who was in touch with @entity1			1
@entity1 and his two friends were arrested before they could carry out the plot			0
it was @entity46 who oversaw this plot			0
after all , who better to oversee @entity15 plots to attack the @entity21 than someone who had grown up in @entity57 and @entity61 ? a @entity9 army spokesman said on @entity155 on saturday that @entity46 was killed in @entity156 along @entity9 's border with @entity76			1
the fact that @entity46 is now dead makes the @entity21 a little bit safer from @entity15 's plotting			1
and the fact that @entity46 was killed in a @entity9 military operation is a sign that @entity9 continues to expand its operations against militants based on its border with @entity76 in a meaningful way , which has long been a demand of the @entity21			1
finally , @entity46 's death is indicative of how @entity15 's core organization that launched the 9/11 attacks continues to dwindle in size and capacity , because almost all of its leaders are now dead or captured			1
the elimination of almost all of @entity15 's leaders in @entity9 suggests that the once - global organization may become just another @entity9 - based jihadi group with limited or no ability to operate outside of @entity181 .			1

@entity9 kills an @entity21 @entity15 *commander* who was on @entity48 " @entity50 " list
@entity186 says the death of @entity46 makes @entity21 safer
@entity186 says he was key in plan to bomb @entity36 subway around 8th anniversary of 9/11 attacks
he says @entity15 continues to dwindle as a threat *due* to elimination of most of its leaders
