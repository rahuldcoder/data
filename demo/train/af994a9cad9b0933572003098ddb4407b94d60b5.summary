-- may 20 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity15 @entity16 : annyeonghaseyo ! we love @entity0			1
we are watching @entity0 from @entity15			1
yay ! @entity18 , @entity19 : someone introducing our show from half a world away ? might have found something that 's more awesome than fridays			1
first up : @entity27 @entity28 : first up , president @entity29 announces a " new chapter " in the @entity32 policy toward the @entity33			1
in yesterday 's speech , the president talked about all of the upheaval that 's been sweeping across that part of the world			1
he called the revolutions and political protests a wave of change that can not be denied			1
president @entity29 said the @entity32 does and will support reforms in the @entity33 and @entity45 that help ordinary people in the nations there			1
and he spoke out harshly against governments that have used force on protesters			1
he also pushed to re-start the @entity53 - @entity52 peace process , saying that the demand for change in the region might help kick - start negotiations			1
in terms of changes across the entire @entity33 , the president said " it will be years before this story reaches its end			1
" but he explained why the @entity32 supports change			1
@entity32 president @entity29 : there 's no straight line to progress , and hardship always accompanies a season of hope			1
the @entity32 was founded on the belief that people should govern themselves			1
and now , we can not hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who are reaching for their rights , knowing that their success will bring about a world that is more peaceful , more stable and more just			2
@entity79 @entity28 : the @entity80 is setting a record in the city of @entity4			2
but not the kind anyone wants to celebrate			2
the river crested -- reached its highest point -- at just over 57 feet			2
that 's more than a foot higher than the old record , set in 1927			2
what you should be seeing here is a runway			2
this is a small airport			2
these hangars are the only sign of that now			2
@entity5 also suffered its first flood - related death yesterday			2
we 've reported on some of the people affected by the @entity5 's rising waters			2
there are also concerns about wildlife , like this coyote you saw a moment ago , who 's searching for higher ground			2
this day in history @entity28 : it 's may 20th , and on this day in history in 1902 , @entity110 gained its independence after being ruled by @entity113			2
in 1927 , @entity32 aviator @entity114 took off for his famous flight across the @entity116			1
it was the world 's first solo , non-stop , transatlantic flight			2
and five years later , in 1932 , @entity120 made her solo , non-stop flight across the @entity116			2
it was the first time that goal was accomplished by a female pilot			2
@entity6 's economy @entity28 : next up , we have a report from @entity129 that 's related to @entity6 's gross domestic product , or gdp			1
that 's the total value of all the goods and services that a country produces in a given amount of time			1
@entity6 's gdp is down			1
and to find out one of the big reasons why , you just need to look back at what happened a couple months ago			2
( begin video ) @entity143 , @entity0 correspondent : the tsunami that leveled @entity6 's northern coastline on march 11th is now , two months later , destroying a new terrain : the country 's economy			1
@entity6 's government announced the nation 's gross domestic product fell at a surprising 3.7 % annualized rate in the first quarter of 2011			1
it 's the second quarter in a row the gdp has fallen , meaning @entity6 is now in a recession			1
look deeper into the gdp fall , and the numbers are even more grim			2
industrial output , which includes all the consumer products @entity6 sends around the world , plunged 15.3 % in march , the worst ever recorded in @entity6 's history			1
the auto industry hurt the most			2
car production fell almost 60 percent in march			2
@entity166 's president and ceo @entity165 re-opened a hard - hit factory in the tsunami zone just this week , leading workers in a rah - rah session , but acknowledging full recovery for the company is still months away			1
in the hard - hit region of @entity175 , half of the companies and factories -- 10,000 of them -- are affected by the earthquake and tsunami ; 600 expected to close			1
@entity6 's government says a quarter of a million foreigners left @entity6 in the immediate aftermath of the disaster			1
as far as tourism coming in , it 's fallen off a cliff			0
airports are reporting a 35 to 60 percent drop in travelers			0
the nuclear crisis at @entity192 is also fueling concerns of an energy shortage , impacting @entity6 's ability to produce cars , electronics and parts for months to come			1
experts say @entity6 's economy was already struggling before the disaster			1
@entity203 senior economist @entity202 believes there is a chance the disaster could have an unintended positive outcome			0
@entity208 , @entity209 economist : the silver lining of this earthquake was that perhaps this will accelerate the reform pressures , and that @entity6 , then , in a year or two years from now , emerges stronger than it actually had been in the run - up to the earthquake			1
( @entity216 ) @entity217 @entity218 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity221 's social studies classes at @entity222 in @entity223 , @entity224 ! what does an odometer measure ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity232 , b ) distance , c ) rotation or @entity233 ) temperature ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! an odometer measures distance , like how far your car has traveled			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! tax on @entity242 ? @entity28 : some lawmakers are looking into the idea of charging drivers based on their odometers			0
right now , part of what you pay to fill up your car is a federal gas tax			0
that money gets used to build and maintain highways and to help pay for mass transit systems			0
but with more fuel - efficient cars on the road , people are driving more miles using less gas			0
so this " driving tax " would charge people by the mile , either instead of or in addition to the gas they buy			0
the more you drive , the more you pay			0
it might help bring in money to the government , but some critics say collecting mileage information raises concerns about privacy			0
should the government know how much you drive ? also , they 're worried that this could be unfair to drivers in more rural areas who have to drive farther			0
@entity276 @entity28 : now , this is n't an official proposal ; it 's just an idea at this point that some people are talking about			0
we want you to talk about it ! do you think it 's better to tax drivers by the mile or the gallon ? zoom on over to our blog at @entity289 and share your opinions			0
around in circles @entity28 : all right , we 're going to stay in the driving lane here and look at something called a roundabout			0
it 's a kind of intersection , but not one with a traditional crossing			0
a roundabout -- as the name suggests -- is a circle			0
officials say they do n't make sense in every situation			0
but @entity307 steers us toward one mayor who 's all about the circular logic			1
( begin video ) @entity312 , @entity0 correspondent : north of @entity313 , in the suburb of @entity7 , mayor @entity314 has been going around in circles for years over traffic jams			1
@entity319 @entity318 , ( r ) @entity7 , @entity8 : roundabouts work everywhere @entity321 : he has done away with traffic lights at 80 % of his town 's major intersections , replacing them with roundabouts			1
whirlpools of traffic that keep people moving			0
@entity331 : it 's made a huge difference in the way our city looks and feels , and the way people get around			0
@entity321 : roundabouts , not to be confused with bigger , more intimidating rotaries on the @entity340 , are designed to smoothly sweep drivers in from any direction , slowly guide them around , and just as easily let them out and on their way			1
since cars do n't stop , commuters save time and , officials say , use 30 % less gas at intersections			0
@entity331 : a roundabout can handle about 4 to 5 times the amount of traffic in the same amount of time as a stop light intersection can have			0
@entity321 : the mayor says intersection accidents are also way down , improving insurance rates			1
and the city saves money , too			0
@entity331 : we do n't have to buy a $ 150,000 signal			0
we do n't have to buy electricity every year			0
and we do n't have to replace it after 15 years when all that mechanical equipment wears out			0
@entity321 : some drivers and pedestrians do n't like roundabouts , but local officials insist this simple idea is building up the quality of life here , and that 's building up the business climate all around			1
( @entity216 ) promo @entity28 : the @entity0 documentary " @entity376 " looks at the state of education in @entity32			1
if you did n't catch the premiere , the program is re-airing this saturday , at 8:00 p.m. @entity382 on @entity0			1
our educator guide for " @entity376 " is in the @entity386 section at @entity289			0
before we go @entity28 : before we go , you might be planning a trip to the beach for this summer			0
these dogs get to take one every day			0
and it 's all thanks to the @entity393			0
the driver picks up her passengers in the morning			0
some of them even wait for her out on the street			0
once the beach bus rounds up all of its canine companions , it heads out to the water for an hour of fun			0
then it 's back on the bus to head home			0
@entity407 delivery service to and from the beach ? goodbye @entity28 : those are some lucky dogs , fur - real			0
they even have a designated place to leave the bus : a barking lot			0
aack ! we just hope they behave during the ride , ' cause a dog who 's acting up can be a real pet peeve			0
all right ! for @entity0 , i 'm @entity25			1
have a great weekend !			0
