-- @entity2 state sen. @entity1 , who supports gov. @entity4 's repeal of a law that protected workers from pay discrimination , recently said , " you could argue that money is more important for men			1
i think a guy in their first job , maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday , may be a little more money - conscious			0
" as a graduating student surrounded by classmates about to assume their first jobs , i assure the senator that none of my female classmates is thinking , " salary is n't that important to me			0
i do n't plan to work hard and do n't need to be paid fairly , because i wo n't be a breadwinner			1
a man will come along to take care of that for me			2
" instead , many young women about to enter the workforce are focused on paying off their student loan debt			2
those who are also mothers are worried about how to financially provide for , and simultaneously care for , their young children			2
the single moms among us face even larger challenges			0
and we are worried about our sisters who do n't have college degrees and so do n't have the same earning power			0
what female students might not remember is that the men with whom we stand shoulder - to - shoulder at graduation do n't face the same financial challenges			0
many young women of my generation believe they live in a post-feminist world , without unfair sex discrimination -- a world in which career paths are designed with fathers and mothers in mind			0
unfortunately , that world does n't exist quite yet			0
a significant gender pay gap still persists			0
that 's why we can not be passive as we acknowledge @entity60 , which marks the day when a woman 's earnings catch up to what her male peers earned in the previous year			1
to millennials , it 's startling to see that women still earn just 77 cents to the dollar of what men earn			1
women of color are hit especially hard : african - american and @entity75 women earn 70 % and 61 % , respectively , of what white men earn			1
without any male income in their household , single women and lesbians may feel the pay gap effect all the more			1
this wage gap costs working women and their families more than $ 10,000 annually and jeopardizes women 's retirement security			1
this gap is n't just about women making different choices in their careers			1
even after accounting for occupation , hours worked , education , age , race , ethnicity , marital status , number of children and more , a difference of 5 % still persists in the earnings of male and female college graduates one year after graduation			0
after 10 years in the workplace , that gap more than doubles to 12 %			0
today we are fortunate to have critical laws like the @entity108 , which overturned a 2007 @entity110 decision that made it harder for women -- and all employees -- to pursue federal claims of pay discrimination			1
although this important law restored fairness for workers who want to use federal law to challenge cases of discriminatory pay , it only addresses one piece of the larger puzzle			0
more needs to be done			0
paycheck discrimination is not the only obstacle preventing women from having the same economic opportunities as men			2
as our country continues to focus on our economic recovery , leveling the financial playing field for women must be a priority			0
according to recent predictions , within a generation , more families will be supported by women than men			1
if these primary breadwinners earn lower incomes , it wo n't just affect their families , but also consumer spending and our larger financial growth			0
for starters , we need to further close the pay gap by fulfilling the promise of equal pay for work of equal value			1
entire employment sectors should n't be paid less because they 're considered " women 's work			1
" because so much of " women 's work " is paid at minimum wage , one way to begin to address this is to pass the @entity157 , which would gradually raise the federal minimum wage and index the tipped minimum wage to keep pace with inflation			1
women and families also need paid sick days and paid leave			1
the @entity166 remains the only country in the developed world that does not mandate paid sick leave , despite the cost benefits to businesses , workers and our larger economy			2
according to the @entity177 , employers lose hundreds of billions of dollars in productivity when sick workers stay on the job , while workers who are forced to stay home without pay because of illness lose critical income			2
these costs of unpaid leave take a disproportionate toll on women , who are more likely to have care - giving responsibilities and be unable to take time off to care for family members when they fall ill. our generation can change this			2
we know what the problems are and we know what the solutions are , but we have to demand that our elected officials and business leaders take action			0
at the federal and state level , we have to fight efforts to repeal equal pay laws			1
we have to support increases in the minimum wage			1
and we have to demand that the @entity166 join our global competitors in giving workers paid leave			0
all these issues affect our individual financial health and the strength of our collective economy			0
on this @entity60 , i hope all young women -- and men -- join this fight and prove that none of this is about " money being more important for men " or for women			1
it 's about the kind of country we want to live in , work in and pursue our dreams in			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

@entity231 : women care about wages as much as men do ; they want to be paid fairly
on @entity60 , women still make 77 cents for every dollar that men make , she says
@entity231 : more families will be supported by women than men , making issue more crucial
@entity231 pushes equal pay for equal work , *higher* minimum wage , guaranteed sick days
