the @entity0 on thursday took a step toward essentially a total ban on artificial trans fats in @entity5 's food supply			1
this is not a trivial change			0
not that long ago , trans fats were a part of all kinds of processed foods			2
partially hydrogenated oils , as they are otherwise known , tend to improve both the shelf life and flavor of many foods			0
trans fats have been around for more than a hundred years			2
they 're used in a wide range of foods , from frozen pizza to microwave popcorn to packaged cookies			0
but trans fats are amazingly bad for you			1
by the 1990s , evidence was building that trans fats carried a significant risk for increasing coronary heart disease			1
specifically , they were found not only to increase your level of low - density lipoprotein ( @entity33 , or bad cholesterol ) but to decrease your level of high - density lipoprotein ( @entity37 , or good cholesterol )			1
because of this , the negative effects of trans fats are about double those of saturated fat ( which is n't that good for you , either )			2
trans fats also increase your level of lipoprotein ( a ) and triglycerides , both of which are thought to be associated with cardiovascular disease			1
these laboratory findings bear out in all kinds of epidemiologic studies showing that a diet containing higher levels of trans fats carried greater health risk than a diet similarly high in saturated fat			2
there has been a longstanding argument that we should stop using trans fats			2
the @entity63 recommends that people 's diets contain 2 grams or less of trans fats a day			1
that amount is what you might normally get in dairy products and meat			0
but if you eat processed foods , you 'll end up consuming more trans fats			2
in 2006 , the @entity0 started mandating that food labels list the amount of trans fats in foods in order to make consumers aware of their hazard			1
some companies have made an effort to stay away from trans fats			1
@entity85 stopped using them 7 years ago			0
@entity87 has a minimal amount in its foods , and that 's from small amounts that are present naturally in meat and cheese			0
@entity94 banned trans fats in restaurants in 2007			2
it was a controversial decision at the time , but consumption of trans fats in the city has dropped dramatically because of the ban			0
the @entity102 says that removing trans fats from the @entity5 food supply could prevent about 20,000 heart attacks a year and 7,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease			1
finally , the @entity0 issued a @entity108 notice announcing that trans fats are not " generally recognized as safe			1
" such a notice allows a period of time for people and businesses to comment and offer opinions and evidence if they believe that trans fats should not be banned			1
of course , there are costs to such a move			0
the @entity0 estimates that it will cost about $ 8 billion initially to remove trans fats from the food supply			1
it believes the 20 - year costs to be between $ 12 billion and $ 14 billion			0
i think it 's likely that processed food producers will comply			0
there 's almost no good evidence -- or argument -- to support the continued use of trans fats			1
in fact , it 's been reported that some manufacturers have voluntarily lowered the use of trans fats by almost 75 % in the past eight years			1
given these moves , it 's not hard to imagine them going the rest of the distance			0
there is some irony in this , of course			0
trans fats first became more common in our diet because they were believed to be safer than animal fats ( think margarine instead of butter )			0
turns out the opposite is true			0
the @entity0 's actions are putting us on the road to correcting that mistake , hopefully sooner rather than later .			0

the @entity0 took a first step toward *eliminating* artificial trans fats in food supply
@entity160 : @entity0 made the right move , since trans fats are very bad for people
he says evidence shows trans fats increase bad cholesterol and heart disease
@entity160 : it 's likely food suppliers will comply despite the costs of removing trans fats
