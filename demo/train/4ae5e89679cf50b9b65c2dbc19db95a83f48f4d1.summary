@entity0 , @entity1 -- two months			2
it looks like it might be that long before a local grand jury decides whether to bring charges in the death of @entity8 -- the loud , passionate calls for swift justice notwithstanding			1
the shooting of the @entity14 - @entity13 teenager by a white @entity0 , @entity1 , police officer has sparked days of demonstrations and nights of often violence protests in the @entity19 suburb			1
@entity21 prosecuting attorney @entity20 told @entity2 affiliate @entity22 that his office planned to begin presenting the case to a grand jury wednesday			1
the grand jury could levy significant charges against @entity28 , the police officer who shot and killed the 18 - year - old @entity8			1
but @entity20 suggested wednesday that any action -- charges or no charges -- wo n't come any time soon			1
" the aspirational time is by mid-october to have everything completed , " the prosecutor told the station			2
granted , @entity20 is n't the only law enforcement leader whose office could take action against @entity28			1
one other such leader -- @entity13 attorney general @entity40 -- spent wednesday in and around @entity0 , @entity1 , talking with residents , leaders and the man charged with maintaining security in the city after nearly two weeks of unrest			1
the most high - profile figure in president @entity49 's administration to visit @entity0 , @entity40 has stressed that the federal government is on the case and listening -- both to protesters calling for @entity28 's arrest and for an end to what they describe as a heavy - handed police response , and to residents and law enforcement officers challenged with looting and violence from some in the crowd			1
@entity40 joined dozens of @entity65 agents who have swarmed on the eastern @entity1 city , as the @entity68 's civil rights division probes the case			1
but for charges and a conviction in a federal civil rights case , authorities would have to prove " racial hostility , " according to @entity2 senior legal analyst @entity73 , should they argue that @entity28 somehow targeted @entity8			1
@entity40 himself acknowledged this distinction wednesday , saying that he hoped all of the investigative work being done has a positive impact			1
that said -- for all the symbolic significance of a sitting attorney general visiting the site of an active investigation -- what happens in the @entity21 courts may more likely impact activists ' bottom line : justice for @entity8 's family in the form of @entity28 's arrest			1
on the local level , @entity1 's governor could appoint a special prosecutor to the case in place of @entity20			2
@entity97 , a @entity19 alderman who has been a protest fixture , thinks installing a special prosecutor would be smart given the @entity14 - @entity13 community 's distrust of the county prosecutor and law enforcement in general			1
perception equates to reality if it means that citizens do n't trust @entity20 , @entity97 said			0
" we 're trying to restore faith in the justice system , " said @entity97 , who claimed @entity20 's " relationship with the @entity14 - @entity13 community has not been good for a long time			0
" for his part , @entity20 told @entity22 that he wants the case to proceed through the grand jury " expeditiously " but also " thoroughly			1
" " we 're not going to rush it through , and we 're not going to leave anything out , " he said			0
" they will have absolutely everything that there is , every piece of paper , every photograph , every bit of physical evidence , all the forensic information			2
" assuming @entity20 stays in charge and his grand jury timeline holds , @entity97 said that having weeks and weeks go by will only aggravate the situation			1
" i think the people expect to see something by now , " he said			0
" and they 're getting frustrated			0
" 5 things to know about @entity8 's shooting @entity28 backers challenged , then whisked away while not as large in number as previous days , protesters were out again wednesday night			1
one thing different this time around : a man and a woman who held up a sign that read , " justice for @entity142			0
" @entity143 , a restaurant employee who asked not to be identified by her full name because she believed that @entity28 's supporters could be endangered , said , " we just feel like we have a @entity147 right like everyone else			1
if they 're calling for justice , we need justice for everyone			2
" the man alongside her , @entity153 , added : " all our friends think we 're crazy , but someone has to take a stand			0
" the pair quickly drew dozens of @entity8 family supporters , who converged and yelled at them			1
yet the commotion ended quickly when the two @entity28 supporters were whisked away			1
on tuesday night , hours of relative calm were upended when someone threw a bottle at police			0
officers -- lined up in front of businesses , wearing helms and shields -- responded by sprinting after young men			0
this prompted a handful of protesters to toss more bottles , glass and plastic			0
@entity180 capt. @entity179 , who is in charge of security , later told reporters someone threw urine on police			0
complete coverage of @entity0 shooting and protests after the chase , the number of riot police ballooned			2
one officer used pepper spray on some in the crowd			2
protesters locked hands in front of a police line , and some urged the crowd to remain peaceful			0
others , wearing t - shirts printed with the word " peacekeeper , " tried to defuse tensions			0
@entity179 credited them for preventing further escalation			0
police arrested 47 people , @entity179 said , including a car full of people who he said were armed and threatened to shoot an officer			2
at least one officer also threatened a protester : the @entity217 said an officer from nearby @entity219 was suspended indefinitely after pointing an assault rifle at a " peaceful " protester			2
@entity222 showed the @entity219 officer cursing and threatening to kill a protester			2
@entity224 , a retired @entity225 general who handled crowd control in the chaos that ensued after @entity228 in @entity229 in 2005 , was among those critics of the law enforcement response			2
looking at crowd members through the scope of a gun sends the wrong message , he said			0
" you 're there to protect people , " @entity224 added			0
" they need to sense that from you			0
" @entity40 : ' we need concrete action to change things ' in his public comments , @entity40 has urged law enforcement to show restraint and respect people 's right to protest , while he has condemned looting and violence by protesters			1
on wednesday , he made it personal as well			0
in addition to meeting with @entity8 's parents , @entity40 talked at nearby @entity256 about his own experiences as a black man with racial profiling -- including once when police flagged him down for no apparent reason in @entity262 , when he was a federal prosecutor			1
" we are starting here a good dialogue , but the reality is the dialogue is not enough , " he said			0
" we need concrete action to changes things in this country			0
" after these remarks , 27 - year - old student @entity270 -- who said her brother died of cardiac arrest , allegedly after @entity0 police used a stun gun on him in 2011 -- credited @entity40 with giving her and others needed " inspiration " at a time when her city 's future " is blurry			1
" magazine : the aftermath in @entity0 read more about the flash point in the @entity285 at @entity2 / @entity13 @entity286 reported from @entity0			0
@entity287 and @entity288 reported and wrote from @entity289			0
@entity2 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 also contributed to this report .			0
