-- @entity1 is attempting to eviscerate women 's health care			1
like many women across @entity5 , i am outraged			0
tomorrow , the @entity6 will vote on legislation proposed by sen. @entity8 that would allow employers to deny coverage for health care services that are considered morally objectionable			1
on february 16 , republicans in the @entity13 held a hearing designed to undermine president @entity16 's decision to guarantee women free access to contraception health care regardless of their workplace			1
we all have the right to disagree and fight for our beliefs			0
but by definition , a hearing is an inquiry into many sides of an issue with testimony from various points of views			0
but mark this : the @entity33 did not have a single woman to testify in support of the contraception mandate			2
that is not a hearing ; that is a sham			0
@entity40 , a front - runner in the @entity33 primaries , has expressed support for life at conception legislation that could outlaw common forms of contraception , which would adversely affect many women			1
@entity40 has also vowed to end family planning funding that @entity5 's most financially disadvantaged women rely on for cancer screening , contraception and other basic reproductive health care needs			1
voters , including @entity54 , overwhelmingly support health care coverage for contraception			1
the truth is women use contraception not only as a way to prevent unintended pregnancies , but also to improve their health and the health of their families			2
increased access to contraception is directly linked to declines in maternal and infant mortality			2
it can also protect women against debilitating symptoms of endometriosis and reduce the risk of ovarian cancer			0
but contraception is n't just a basic health care issue for women , it 's also an economic issue			1
today , many women pay $ 15 to $ 50 a month for contraception , even with insurance			2
that 's as much as $ 600 a year , money that many @entity5 families are struggling to find			0
in a recent interview on @entity88 , @entity89 , a prominent supporter of @entity33 presidential hopeful @entity90 , said , " on this contraceptive thing , my gosh			0
... you know , back in my days , they used @entity96 aspirin for contraceptives			0
the gals put it between their knees and it was n't that costly			0
" does this man have no wife , daughter or sister ? i pray that his comment , which might conceivably be pawned off as a joke if it were not so dangerous , does not represent the perspective of the people in government who have the power to determine women 's health choices			1
but judging by some of the proposed legislation floating around , @entity89 is hardly alone in his view			0
i respectfully ask members of @entity1 to not be blinded by the desires of a small but vocal anti-contraception community that could put the physical and financial health of millions of @entity5 women and families on the line			1
thankfully , president @entity16 has stood firmly behind women 's health care issues by supporting coverage for contraception and reaffirming commitment to organizations like @entity131			1
anyone seeking office would be wise to take heed that women are watching and we will not tolerate political rhetoric that threatens our health , safety and well - being			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			0

@entity143 : @entity1 is trying to eviscerate women 's health care
poll : voters , including @entity54 , support free access to contraception coverage
@entity143 : contraception is n't just a basic health care issue ; it 's also an economic issue
she says politicians should be *mindful* that women will not tolerate threats to their health
