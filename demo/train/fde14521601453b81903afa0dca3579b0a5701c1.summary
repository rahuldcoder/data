@entity0 -- a federal judge on tuesday ordered a full mental competency screening for @entity4 , who is accused of jumping the @entity6 fence , after a disputed initial examination found him not competent for trial			1
@entity10 district court judge @entity9 expressed concern that the initial mental exam , ordered by a magistrate judge , was done before she had a chance to hear a legal motion by the defense disputing whether the magistrate had the authority to order it			2
@entity19 , the federal public defender representing @entity4 , objected to any examination in the first place because he says @entity4 is fit for trial			1
the 60 - minute initial mental examination of @entity4 at the @entity0 jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense			1
but the result , finding @entity4 not competent , ca n't be ignored , @entity9 said in court tuesday			1
@entity19 told the judge : " there is no doubt in my mind that mr. @entity4 is competent to stand trial			1
" nonetheless , he withdrew his objections and agreed to allow his client to undergo a fuller competency examination to try to undo the results of the initial examination			0
the judge delayed arraignment for @entity4 on new charges the government filed against him last week			2
@entity4 was arrested in september after he allegedly jumped the @entity6 fence and sprinted into the executive mansion , setting off concerns about @entity50 security procedures			1
he was found with a folding knife and told a @entity50 agent " that he was concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing and needed to get the information to the @entity59 so that he could get the word out to the people , " according to an agent 's affidavit filed in court			0
his family has said @entity4 , an @entity64 veteran , suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia			2
the incident came amid a series of disclosures about @entity50 lapses that cost the agency 's director , @entity71 , her job			0
@entity9 said that during the initial examination , the mental health screener found @entity4 did understand some parts of the proceedings			1
the judge suggested that @entity4 's mental issues , which she did n't describe more fully , could be resolved with medication			0
the judge also raised concerns that the government 's handling of previous unrelated cases could mean it will take some time for @entity4 to be examined at a federal @entity87 facility			0
she gave one example of an unnamed defendant who sat at the @entity0 jail for months before anyone noticed he had n't received the tests that were ordered			0
the problem , she said , was that sequestration has cut resources for the @entity87 and finding a bed can take time			0
@entity9 ordered the mental health screening to be done in 30 days and set a new hearing for december 3 at 10:30 a.m.			0
