maybe @entity0 and friends were n't so crazy after all			0
@entity2 , the once dominant social - networking site that faded into obscurity during @entity6 's rise to dominance , added 1 million new users over the past month , according to the company			1
" the numbers tell an amazing story of strong momentum and dramatic change for @entity2 , " said @entity10 , ceo of @entity2			0
" and the 1 million - plus new user accounts we 've seen in the last 30 days validates our approach			1
" a team of investors bought out @entity2 in june for the fire - sale price of $ 35 million			2
@entity22 's @entity21 paid ( many would say overpaid ) $ 580 million for it in 2005			0
the new owners , most notably pop star / actor @entity0 , have effectively stopped trying to compete with @entity6 and other social sites , instead focusing on @entity2 's superior platform for posting and listening to music			1
monday 's release from @entity30 credited the site 's new music player , with access to more than 42 million songs , as offering the @entity36 's biggest collection of free music			1
by comparison , @entity39 darling @entity38 , which launched in the @entity40 in july , was claiming 15 million songs at that time			2
" @entity2 is building meaningful social entertainment experience around content , where consumers can share and discover the music they love , " @entity10 said			2
" consumers are getting excited about @entity2 again -- a testament to a great music product			0
" the new @entity2 player offers unlimited , on - demand listening to both established and unsigned artists , personalized radio modes , a recommendation engine and easy integration with @entity6			0
obviously , it remains to be seen whether the resurgence ( which has amounted to roughly 40,000 new sign - ups a day ) will continue			0
but with @entity38 beginning to limit the number of songs users with free accounts can play , it seems possible there could be space for a new online music player serving up similar content for free .			1
