he closed his computer and joined me in our bedroom			0

@entity0 : what makes a marriage last develop a creative connection before we had kids or blogs , we had @entity54 , our black lab -- @entity5 described him as the snooze button on our biological clocks			0
our obsession with @entity54 was the subject of great amusement and mockery among our friends , not least because we trained him with " @entity63 " - themed commands			1
the @entity33 gave us a place to indulge our shared obsession without ( audible ) derision : we posted online photos from every dog walk , and when @entity54 's ear was torn by a pit bull , we created an online monument to " @entity73 , " illustrated with photos we manipulated to look like the famous @entity76 self - portrait			1

instead of sitting on the sofa with our separate computers , we spent that summer 's evenings on our feet , dancing our guts out			1
the playfulness and physical energy of our dance nights were great for our connection , our health and our passion			1
get perspective when i go to a party with @entity5 , we tend to go in separate directions and talk with different people			0
the high point of the evening is always when i wander over to his elbow and intrude on his conversation -- seeing the way he connects with , listens to and amuses other people gives me fresh eyes on the qualities i love about him and makes me happier and prouder than ever			0
the same thing happens when i drop in on his @entity151 page or @entity2 feed -- there he is , entertaining people with his latest quip , offering a word of support to a great cause or cramming a wise and poignant note into 140 characters			1

" want me to tweet the photo ? " i asked , and he nodded			0
a few weeks later , a friend commented on the gory snaps , much to @entity5 's surprise			2
the anesthetic had n't fully worn off by the time of our shoot , apparently , and @entity5 had no memory of the tweeting			0
