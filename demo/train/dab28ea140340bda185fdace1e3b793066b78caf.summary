-- the deadline for enrolling in the @entity3 insurance exchanges for those who want coverage that starts on january 1 is about to pass			1
late last week , i became one of the 189,000 @entity9 to sign up on @entity11 's partner exchange , @entity12			1
@entity11 is one of 14 states that elected to set up its own exchange rather than rely on the federal government to do so			1
it is also one of the states that have accepted the @entity22 expansion			0
in other words , @entity11 , led by a popular @entity24 governor , @entity23 , is all - in on @entity3 , and i decided to go along for the ride			1
i did this despite being opposed to @entity3 , and i am increasingly convinced that it will eventually have to be either drastically reformed or replaced outright			1
hardly anyone denies that @entity3 is in trouble			1
though enrollment in the new exchanges has increased in recent weeks , it has still fallen far short of expectations			2
many households that had purchased individual insurance policies in the past have had their policies canceled , and it is widely expected that many small business will receive cancellation notices in the year to come			2
last year , the @entity44 administration argued before the @entity45 that the individual mandate was so essential to the success of the @entity3 that it was inseverable			1
yet last week the @entity48 announced that it would not enforce the mandate against the not inconsiderable number of @entity51 who 've had their policies canceled			0
the @entity22 expansion has succeeded in providing more low - income americans with insurance coverage , though not in the more than 20 states that have so far refused to take part in it			0
president @entity44 and his allies had expected that as @entity3 implementation demonstrated the benefits of the new health law , the public would come to embrace it			1
a new @entity0 / @entity66 survey instead finds that 62 % oppose the law , an increase of 4 percentage points since november			0
so far , at least , it seems as though the more familiar people become with @entity3 and its consequences , the less they like it			2
like most @entity51 , i am an @entity3 critic , and i 've been making the case against the president 's approach to coverage expansion since it started to take shape			2
this is n't because i oppose government 's role in helping people secure insurance coverage			0
i 'm convinced that we would be far better off as a country if all @entity51 had enough health insurance to protect themselves from financial disaster , and that government can and should provide a health safety net			0
but @entity3 does both more and less than that			2
it limits innovation by insurers and providers that can help contain costs			0
it leaves many of the most dysfunctional aspects of @entity51 's health system , such as the monopoly power of big medical providers , largely untouched			0
it treats different households with the same income levels very differently , depending on how they happen to buy insurance			0
its sliding - scale subsidies provide at least some families on the exchanges with a strong disincentive against earning more income			0
and by raising the bar for what counts as acceptable private insurance , there 's a real risk that it will lead to a net decrease in the number of people who have private insurance			0
when i envision an ideal health system , i do n't doubt that it would involve insurance marketplaces where consumers can compare different policies to make informed decisions			0
that is what the insurance exchanges are at their best			0
the big problem with the @entity3 exchanges is that they do n't give insurers the option of offering consumers a wide range of products suited to their needs , and they do n't offer enough flexibility on pricing			2
@entity3 's defenders often claim that conservatives are hypocritical to oppose the law because it relies on the kind of insurance marketplaces that conservatives favor			1
what these critics miss is that the problem is n't having insurance marketplaces per se			0
rather , @entity3 is narrowly constraining the kind of products available on the marketplaces , and in doing it is pricing a fair number of cost - conscious consumers out of the market , even after factoring in subsidies			1
i should also note that i do n't think @entity155 have great solutions for @entity51 's health care woes either			0
during the 2008 presidential campaign , sen. @entity158 introduced a controversial plan for coverage expansion that i greatly admired and which the @entity24 fiercely attacked			0
ever since then , republicans have been extremely gun - shy about offering ambitious health reform proposals of their own			0
i was sympathetic to the @entity166 coverage expansion law that passed in 2006 under then - gov. @entity167 , which struck me as a reasonable solution for an affluent state with a small uninsured population			0
( the @entity166 experiment has n't turned out as well as i had hoped , but that 's a story for another day			0
) and i 've advocated a number of reforms designed to expand coverage , such as more federal funding for high - risk pools , federal and state reinsurance programs designed to make insurance more affordable and tax reforms designed to limit the health insurance tax subsidies that flow to high - income households while increasing those that flow to low - and middle - income households			0
none of these reforms is cheap , which is why they are opposed by the many of the same @entity155 lawmakers who oppose @entity3			1
eventually , the @entity155 is going to have to recognize that any durable health care fix is going to cost money -- less than @entity3 , perhaps , but not nothing			1
for now , however , millions of @entity51 like me who do n't believe that @entity3 is the right way forward for the country will have to learn to live with it			2
for all my concerns about the @entity3 exchanges , i will say that as a healthy ( knock on wood ) @entity9 resident who is not eligible for subsidies , my experience with @entity12 has been a good one			2
the reason is that @entity11 had already made a mess of its individual insurance market before @entity3 , and @entity3 might actually make it better , at least temporarily			1
@entity11 is one of relatively few states in which average premiums will be substantially lower in @entity3 's first year then they have been in the recent past , as @entity210 of the @entity211 observed in november			1
@entity210 estimates that average premiums in @entity11 will decline by 40 % under @entity3 , the biggest decline in the country			1
they will increase by 179 percent in @entity215 , the state with the biggest increase			0
so why are premiums going down in @entity11 ? @entity11 -- like @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity166 -- already has regulations on the books that impose community - rating and guaranteed issue on all insurers			1
that is , insurers have to accept all comers , regardless of health status , and they are strictly limited in the extent to which they can charge different consumers different amounts for insurance			0
but these states , with the exception of @entity166 since its 2006 health law went into effect , do n't impose a mandate			0
the result has been that sick people have flocked to the individual insurance market while healthy people have avoided it at all cost , and this in turn has led to higher premiums			1
by pushing healthy people to buy coverage , the individual mandate allowed insurers to lower premiums in the individual market in @entity166 , and insurers are betting that it will do the same in @entity11			1
indeed , some researchers have called @entity11 a " poster child " for the individual mandate			1
the question for insurers and @entity9 buying coverage on the exchanges is whether the relatively low premiums on the @entity11 state exchange are sustainable			1
if the individual mandate is never enforced ( a very real possibility ) , insurers could find themselves losing enormous sums of money as the problems that plagued @entity11 's individual insurance market in the past reassert themselves			1
( there are , to be sure , more attractive alternatives to the individual mandate that state governments might embrace , like default insurance			1
) people often accuse conservatives of rooting for @entity3 to fail			1
i 'm personally rooting for an outcome in which all @entity51 can have access to affordable health coverage			0
i 'm just deeply skeptical that @entity3 is the best way to achieve that goal			2
but if i 'm wrong , if @entity3 and the new health insurance exchanges turn out to be a great success , i will be among the beneficiaries			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity292 .			2

@entity292 : i oppose @entity3 but i decided to sign up for the @entity11 exchange
he says @entity11 premiums falling *dramatically* because of individual mandate
@entity292 says @entity3 likely will have to be *revised* or *scrapped* *due* to low enrollment
he says conservatives need an alternative to @entity3 and it will cost money
