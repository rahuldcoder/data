-- while most children @entity3 's age are thinking about what they 're going to be for @entity5 , this 8 - year - old from @entity7 is thinking about who she 's going to be each day of the week			1
but do n't misinterpret what she 's doing as " dressing in costume , " her mother said			1
@entity3 is dressing " in character " based on what she has in her closet and where her imagination takes her			1
all it takes is a black dress and a red - tissue paper flower in her hair and she 's jazz singer @entity20			0
or , she 's @entity21 with a flannel shirt and stuffed chimp tucked under her arm			0
with a khaki shirt emblazoned with a police badge she 's her @entity27 , a police officer			0
" she 's definitely drawn to characters that have overcome a lot , with a lot of inner strength , " her mother , @entity28 , said			1
her ideas come from books , people she learns about or even friends and relatives , she said			0
the list goes on and on because she has n't repeated a single costume since she started last year at the beginning of second grade , @entity3 and her mother say			1
@entity3 was reading @entity44 's " @entity47 " series about a pioneer family 's life and wondered what the author wore			1
the next day she showed up to school in a dress with leggings , @entity3 said , starting a tradition that lasted the entire school year			1
she resurrected it this year as she began third grade			0
it 's important to not repeat characters , @entity3 said in a phone interview , because doing so would mean fewer opportunities to try something new			1
" i think it 's better to focus on as much as we can , " she said			1
" if i repeat an outfit five times that 's five times we do n't have for a new character			1
" not all of the characters are obvious or distracting , which minimizes their potential to disturb the classroom , her mother said			2
to the contrary , teachers and students love it because they tend to learn something new about the person @entity3 is emulating			2
" i think its just in her genes , " said @entity78 , who worked in local theater in @entity80 before she had kids			2
@entity3 's father is the director of @entity80 's @entity87 theater			1
" she does this all on her own , " @entity78 said in a phone interview			0
" i do n't costume her or buy anything special for this , we shop at @entity93 and @entity94 for clothes			0
" @entity3 shared insights into her five favorite costumes and what she has learned from them			1
-- @entity101 : " i like her because she led people on the @entity103 , she was a slave			2
... i like how she helped 26 people and risked her life for them			0
" -- @entity106 : " i like how she never gave up on learning and she kept trying until she learned how to read @entity109			2
" -- @entity110 : " she said she had enough of it			2
she stayed on her seat on the bus			0
that was her way of saying , ' no way , this is not fair and i do n't like it ! ' " -- @entity120 : " people just think she 's the person who hid behind the door but she had to move three times			0
... you 've got to do what you have to do			0
" @entity126 ( activist ) : " it 's good to do what you have to do to help people , especially those in need			0
" so , what is she going to do for @entity5 ? " i 'm not sure yet , " @entity3 said			2
" i have n't really thought about it yet as a special day , so probably whatever i had planned			0
