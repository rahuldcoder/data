@entity0 , @entity1 -- a highly anticipated test designed to measure pressure within @entity5 's ruptured @entity7 oil well finally began thursday , and for the first time in nearly three months , oil stopped flowing into the @entity7			1
the move was lauded by a variety of officials as a positive step , accompanied by a strong note of caution that the cutoff was simply part of the test , as @entity5 and government experts try to assess how the well is holding up			1
the test got under way after two days of delays , first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as @entity5 replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line			1
the data are being particularly closely scrutinized at six - hour intervals			0
higher pressure readings mean the well is containing the oil , while lower pressure means some is leaking out			1
the " well integrity " test could end after one of the six - hour periods , if the results are disappointing			1
but it could go on for 48 hours			0
the longer it goes , the better indications are that the well is holding with a custom - made sealing cap			0
@entity5 cautioned that the oil cutoff , while welcomed , is n't lilkely to go beyond the 48 hours			1
valves are expected to open after that to resume siphoning oil to two ships on the surface , the @entity51 and @entity52 , as government and @entity5 officials assess the data and decide what to do next			1
two more ships are due to join them in coming weeks , bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels of oil a day , more than high - end estimates of how much oil had been leaking			2
" it felt very good to see no oil going into the @entity7 , " @entity5 senior vice president @entity62 said in a briefing			1
he said company officials are " obviously very encouraged " but they are " trying to maintain a strict focus " on remembering the whole purpose of the test , which is to gather data and decide how to proceed			2
" i do n't want to create a false sense of excitement , " he said			0
" we want to move forward and make the right decisions			0
" and @entity5 chief operating officer @entity75 said on @entity2 's " @entity76 " that while no leaks were apparent , " it 's way to early to celebrate			2
" @entity79 , who is overseeing the government 's response to the spill , said in a statement it " remains likely " that sending the oil to containment ships will be the avenue officials decide to pursue after the test , until the ultimate solution is readied -- sealing the well by pumping mud and cement through one of two relief wells being drilled			1
the wells are expected to be completed in august			0
the second one serves as a backup to the first			0
in some earlier briefings , @entity79 had been mentioned the possibility of leaving the cap closed , after the test			2
@entity79 said experts also will examine options for shutting off the well again temporarily , if there 's a hurricane			0
meanwhile , from state and local officials around the @entity112 , there were warnings that the cleanup from the spill could take years			2
it 's a step in the right direction , " said @entity118 sen. @entity117 of @entity119 , who 's been outspoken about the damaged caused by the spill			2
but he noted , " my goodness			0
this have taken us three months			0
we 've been hurt , and hurt badly			0
" @entity1 governor @entity125 said in a statement he was " cautiously optimistic " as the test proceeds			1
but he said , " work to revitalize our coast wo n't be done until our waters and our shores are completely clean and our wildlife , our communities and our coastal industries are 100 percent restored			0
" @entity119 governor @entity134 sounded a similar note , stating , " while i am pleased that oil no longer is flowing freely into the @entity7 , there is more work to do to help families , businesses and communities on the @entity142 as they recover from this disaster			1
" @entity5 's stock jumped on word that the oil flow had been cut off , as part of the test			1
the stock rose $ 2.74 a share , more than 7 percent , to close at $ 38.92			0
earlier this month , it traded below $ 30 a share			0
the oil stopped flowing shortly before 2:25 p.m. ct , according to @entity62			2
and a series of cameras some 5,000 feet below the surface clearly showed the halt -- a far different scene from the images day after day of a relentless flow			2
the stacking cap , lowered in place earlier this week , has never been deployed at such depths or under such conditions and , therefore , there were no guarantees on how well it would contain the oil , @entity5 said			1
in the test , @entity5 closed off -- one by one -- the valves on the cap system through which oil could escape			1
if at any time the pressure is deemed too low -- meaning that oil is escaping through another source in the breached well -- the testing would stop , according to @entity79			1
@entity79 compared low pressure in the well to a leaky garden hose that dribbles out water with your thumb pressed hard on the nozzle , @entity79 said			0
the catastrophe in the @entity7 began when the @entity184 drilling rig exploded april 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the relentless spill			2
@entity79 said the cap was not designed to permanently shut in the well -- it was meant to move to a four - vessel containment system and assure redundancy in the event of a hurricane			0
but he had said in earlier briefings there could be a huge side benefit if the oil can be contained -- a " twofer , " as he called it			0
as for the relief wells , @entity5 pumped drilling mud into them to mitigate risks during the pressure testing			1
oil recovery was also stopped wednesday ahead of the integrity test but resumed while @entity5 was fixing the problem with the leaking choke line			1
it was stopped again with the testing under way .			0

new : @entity210 says it " remains likely " oil will be sent to surface ships , after test
@entity119 , @entity1 governors caution that much cleanup work remains
@entity5 says there is no oil flowing into @entity7 for first time in months
cutoff in flow is part of the *key* " well integrity " pressure test
