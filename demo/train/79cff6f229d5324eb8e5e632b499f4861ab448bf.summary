@entity0 -- in 2003 , the sars virus epidemic was a wake - up call for @entity4 , forcing @entity5 to increase transparency , fostering closer regional cooperation and bringing human security issues to the fore			1
the disappearance of @entity11 will have a similar transformative effect on regional security , but it will take a different form			1
in recent years , the focus -- driven by the need to protect the waters of approximately a third of the world 's trade , as well as access to energy and resources -- has been on sea lanes , concentrating on reducing piracy and enhancing naval cooperation			2
the @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity5 have all ratcheted up their patrols , buttressed by the smaller naval operations of @entity0 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			2
read more : we owe it to the families to solve riddle , says @entity42 pm but at times the focus on maritime security in @entity4 has led to tensions			1
@entity5 has resented the encroachment of other powers into waters it views as its own , while spats have intensified between @entity5 and its regional neighbors , particularly over islands in the @entity53			2
@entity5 's increasingly assertive position has engendered a wariness among countries in the region that has been an undercurrent in the cooperation between neighbors during the current @entity11 crisis			1
@entity63 security @entity11 , attention will increasingly turn to the skies			1
the disappearance of the @entity68 jet has revealed shortcomings in monitoring air space			0
that no one even knew the plane had veered off course for seven hours raises serious questions -- even allowing for the fact the jetliner 's tracking mechanisms effectively turned off			0
the contradictions and slow trickle of information from the @entity33 authorities and regional neighbors has highlighted how disjointed , uneven and vulnerable the monitoring of airspace across borders is			2
satellite intelligence has increased yet no coordination or mechanism for effective information sharing exists			1
many nations are not willing to reveal the technology at their disposal , as seems evident in the delays in sharing data , while some -- particularly in @entity4 -- have to turn to others to access satellite technology			1
despite the involvement of over 20 countries in the search , trust and capacity is seemingly lacking			0
the search for @entity11 will lead to a rethink of the existing regional architecture , with the need for stronger multilateral ties to secure safer air travel			1
one option on the table needs to be a credible investigative body to manage air security across the region			2
another important step clearly has to involve improved measures to secure transponders for communication			0
read more : what is a transponder ? @entity11 has also brought the issue of good governance to center stage			1
@entity33 's response has raised serious concerns about accountability , transparency and competence			0
from the get go , the @entity33 authorities were on the back foot , given that more than half of the country 's population voted against the current government in a 2013 election marred by allegations of fraud			0
the government 's alleged persecution of political opponents has fostered deep alienation			0
hours before he was due to contest in a by - election , a @entity33 court overturned opposition leader @entity145 's acquittal of the charge that he sodomized a former political aide			0
the de facto leader of the @entity149 has repeatedly said he is innocent , calling the case against him an attempt by the government to end his political career -- an assertion it has consistently denied			0
days after the plane 's disappearance , @entity145 's lawyer , @entity155 , was charged with sedition in another case viewed by some as politically motivated			0
even against this backdrop , many were willing to give the government a chance			0
but it fell short by failing to learn lessons from the sars virus : countries need to share information in a timely manner and earn credibility , rather than expect it			0
sadly , the international media effectively set the tone for the search for the plane , not the @entity33			0
the mystery of what happened to @entity11 shows that without the basic practices of good governance , lives can be lost and security put in jeopardy			1
the @entity11 crisis has also revealed that in spite of the rise of @entity5 , the @entity27 and its allies still have an important security role to play in @entity4			1
when push came to shove , @entity33 's @entity188 government turned to its @entity191 partners for their investigative skills and search and rescue guidance			0
@entity5 - @entity27 tensions yet @entity195 was been increasingly irked by the rate of progress			1
with more than 150 of its own citizens on board the @entity198 777 - 200 , @entity5 has been frustrated by the delays in information and its inability to effectively protect its own nationals			2
this frustration recently boiled over into criticism of @entity33 's handling of the investigation			0
whatever the outcome the @entity11 mystery , @entity5 will take steps to enhance efforts to monitor and secure airspace in the region			1
this in turn will generate greater wariness among its neighbors and possibly bring it into more frequent contact with @entity191 powers -- especially the @entity27			0
unless checked , @entity5 - @entity27 competition in @entity4 will deepen with pressure on both to increase their involvement in security in @entity4			1
an important constraint on this great power struggle will be a strong multilateral @entity4 - led initiative to enhance aviation security -- one that includes the @entity27 but brings in all the key @entity233 stakeholders			1
we do not yet know what happened			0
we do know however that security in @entity4 will never be the same			2
now more than ever the burden is on @entity4 as a whole to better take care of itself , to come together to assure that its citizens and visitors get the protection and security they need			2
from stronger multilateral ties to good governance , the case of @entity11 can bring about the opportunity for a safer region			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2

@entity11 , attention will increasingly turn to the skies in terms of security , says @entity251
current focus on maritime security in @entity4 has led to tensions , especially with @entity5
" no coordination or mechanism for effective information sharing " in the region
welsh : @entity4 needs better governance , stronger multilateral ties
