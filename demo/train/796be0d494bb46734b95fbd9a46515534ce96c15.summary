-- efforts to rescue a research crew aboard a ship stuck in ice off @entity7 stalled thursday after sea ice conditions made a key element of the rescue plan risky , @entity2 maritime officials said			1
the rescue plan called for a helicopter to ferry the passengers from the @entity15 to a @entity17 vessel , where they would then board a barge to take them to an @entity2 icebreaker , the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) said in a written statement			1
but the shifting ice conditions prevented the barge from being able to reach the @entity17 vessel , the statement said			1
" alternative measures to complete the rescue operation are now being investigated by @entity11 and the ships involved , " the statement said			1
the news is the latest chapter in a saga that began @entity30 after the @entity31 - flagged @entity15 got stuck in 10 feet of ice			2
even if the rescue begins friday , it will still be weeks before the research team will make it to @entity37 , @entity2 , @entity38 of the @entity11 said			1
" mid-january is our best guess , " @entity38 told reporters on a conference call			0
the rescue plan called for the helicopter , which can transport 12 people each trip , to ferry the ship 's 52 passengers -- who include the research team and journalists -- to the @entity17 icebreaker called the @entity53 , or @entity54 , the maritime agency said			1
the 22 @entity31 crew members of the @entity15 will stay aboard , it said			2
the passengers are then to be transported by barge from the @entity17 ship to the @entity2 icebreaker @entity62			1
that 's because the @entity17 helicopter ca n't land on the @entity2 icebreaker because of load restrictions , and ice conditions make it unsafe to land it next to the ship , @entity11 said			1
" the preferred option is to wait for conditions that will allow the rescue to be completed in a single operation to reduce unnecessary risk , " the maritime agency said			1
the master of the @entity15 has decided to keep the crew members on board until the pack ice eventually breaks up and allows the ship to move again , @entity38 said			2
the vessel has enough supplies to keep the crew going for " a very long time , " he said			2
failed rescues the planned helicopter rescue follows a failed attempt by the @entity17 icebreaker , which made it six nautical miles from the trapped vessel before being stopped by the ice			1
that was followed by an effort by the @entity2 icebreaker , which was forced monday to suspend efforts to reach the expedition because of bad weather			1
the @entity62 got within 10 nautical miles of the ship before it turned back			0
over the weekend , an effort by the @entity102 icebreaker @entity100 was called off by the maritime agency			0
in preparation for the helicopter rescue , members of the research team as well as the crew of the @entity15 marked a makeshift helipad on the ice where the helicopter can land			1
video clips posted online by the research team showed people , with arms locked , walking to tamp down the snow			0
" as we understand , the helipad was suitable yesterday and will be suitable today , " @entity11 's @entity116 said			0
once the passengers are safely aboard the @entity62 , the ship will complete a resupply mission to @entity121 , an @entity2 base in @entity7 , before making its way to @entity37 , the maritime agency said			2
viral sensations the exploits of the research crew have gone viral , thanks in large part to @entity129 and @entity130 posts by those aboard the stranded vessel			0
@entity133 , an @entity2 professor of climate change at the @entity135 , has tweeted photos of the stranded ship , the crew and penguins , who he said -- according to one post on @entity129 -- " to check out what 's going on			2
" " the group on this ship is incredibly collegiate , " said @entity143 , a science correspondent for @entity145 newspaper , told @entity0 's @entity148 360			0
" there are a lot of skills and things people are sharing with each other			0
" @entity155 has said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts , and in the meantime , people are doing what they can to keep busy			0
that includes yoga and @entity166 classes , @entity162 and @entity155 said			0
the group even managed to ring in 2014 with good cheer			0
" we 're the @entity172 who have traveled far , having fun doing science in @entity7 ! " a dozen or so of them sang in a video posted on @entity130			0
" lots of snow and lots of ice , lots of penguins , which are very , very nice ! " really good food and company , but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here ! ice cold , cha cha cha ! ice cold , cha cha cha ! " spirits strong among passengers on ship stuck in @entity7 ice @entity0 's @entity192 and @entity193 contributed to this report .			0
