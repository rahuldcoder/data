@entity0 -- today 's technology could extract enough untapped natural gas , frozen in @entity6 's @entity5 , to heat millions of homes for years , federal officials announced wednesday			1
a @entity9 study says there is much natural gas to be tapped from frozen areas in @entity6			1
an estimated 85.4 trillion cubic feet of " undiscovered , technically recoverable gas " is frozen in the state 's @entity5 region , according to a @entity9 study released by the @entity17			1
the deposits could heat more than 100 million homes for a decade , the study says			2
" the assessment points to a truly significant potential for natural gas hydrates to contribute to the energy mix of the @entity26 and the world , " said interior secretary @entity21			2
" this study also brings us closer to realizing the potential of this clean - burning natural gas resource			1
" however , the study warned that further research is needed to determine the long - term impacts of the natural gas hydrates -- essentially methane gas trapped in ice			1
while natural gas is a fossil fuel that emits carbon dioxide , tapping into the gas hydrates assessed in the study is not expected to affect global warming , said @entity44 , coordinator for the @entity45			2
" there is some near - surface gas hydrate , " she said wednesday			0
but , " these are fairly deeper and fairly well - buffered by the sediment and strata above			0
" the natural gas released from the depositing would go straight into a pipeline , not the atmosphere , she said			0
while the existence of frozen natural gas deposits -- especially in the @entity59 region -- has been known for years , the @entity9 study is the first estimate of recoverable natural gas hydrates with current technology			1
the @entity5 natural gas hydrates make up 11.5 percent of the volume of gas within all other undiscovered , technically recoverable gas resources in the @entity26 -- frozen or not , the @entity9 estimated			1
separately , in august , @entity6 gov. @entity67 , the former @entity68 vice presidential candidate , signed a bill allowing @entity70 to build a 1,715 - mile natural gas pipeline from the @entity5 's @entity72 to @entity73 , @entity74			1
during the @entity78 , @entity67 's success in finalizing plans for a gas line was a benchmark that her supporters said represented her ability to work across party lines			0
in the study released wednesday , researchers suggest extracting the natural gas hydrates with " depressurization " -- a method that involves changing the ice into gas and water at the surface			2
the study area extends from the @entity93 in @entity6 on the west and through the @entity95 on the east			0
the latter is a 19 million - acre strip in northeastern @entity6 , where oil exploration has long been prohibited by @entity100			0
@entity9 director @entity101 said the gas hydrates research has been going on for more than 25 years			0
" this is especially important now that a growing body of evidence indicates that concentrated gas hydrate accumulations ... such as those in @entity6 , can be produced with existing technology , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity109 contributed to this report .			0
