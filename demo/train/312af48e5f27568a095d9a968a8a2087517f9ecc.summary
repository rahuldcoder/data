-- as public health officials across the country look into the salmonella outbreak that began in the spring , the state of @entity2 believes it has identified its earliest cases -- and says its investigation helped tip off the rest of the country to the source of the problem			1
on may 28 and 29 , several people became sick after attending either a prom or a graduation party in @entity16 , according to @entity17 , a spokeswoman for the @entity18			1
tests on some of the victims , including a catering worker who nibbled on the food , determined that the culprit was salmonella , she said			1
that finding triggered an investigation			0
by interviewing prom - and party - goers about what they had eaten , the @entity27 found at least one common link -- a delicate custard - filled pastry called profiteroles that was served at both events			0
according to @entity36 , a spokesman for the @entity2 @entity37 , the caterer had run out of pasteurized filler , and made the rest of the fillings with shell eggs			1
throughout june and early july , county officials noted more clusters of two or more salmonella cases			1
in all , 42 people in @entity46 tested positive for salmonella , including six who ended up in the hospital , @entity17 said			1
similar clusters were popping up all over @entity2 , including four in @entity51 -- one traced to a @entity53 restaurant -- and another incident involving food served on a movie set in @entity57 , an incident under investigation by @entity60			1
in @entity46 , investigators were faced with a dilemma			0
because the link to eggs did n't emerge for several weeks after people fell ill , there were no eggs left to test			1
local investigators relied on interviews with food preparers and companies to draw a trail back to a company in @entity75 : @entity76			0
in other counties , too , the trail led in the same direction , according to health officials			1
on july 29 , the @entity2 @entity37 sent a notice to the @entity82 and the @entity84 @entity83 , warning of a connection to @entity76			1
@entity36 said the alert helped confirm the suspicions of officials in other states who were also investigating a surge in salmonella cases			1
@entity2 is just one of 23 states that received eggs potentially contaminated by salmonella from @entity76 or @entity97 of @entity75 , the distributors at the center of the recall of more than half a billion eggs			1
in @entity103 , the agriculture department noted its first seven cases between may 5 and 7			1
investigators have been able to link those illnesses to a @entity108 restaurant in @entity109 , which bought eggs that were produced at @entity111 and distributed by a @entity113 - based wholesaler			2
@entity114 is the latest state on the list of 23			0
the @entity117 told @entity0 on tuesday that eggs associated with the recall have been distributed in the state			2
as the federal government investigates the egg recall and the related salmonella outbreak that it says has sickened about 1,300 @entity84 , the regulatory process is coming under scrutiny from the agencies responsible and people affected by the food safety crisis			1
@entity129 , the director of the @entity82 , said wednesday the investigation took a while because of its complexity			0
" the clusters were very small			0
two or three patients here , two or three patients there			0
" @entity129 also indicated the organism and its dna fingerprint are common , making it harder to isolate			0
it took weeks to determine the illnesses came from eggs and the producers who shipped them , he told the @entity145			2
@entity129 , who indicated federal , state and local health agencies are better now at working together , said the @entity150 's new egg safety measures , along with a stalled food safety bill , are essential			1
" i think the major focus has to be prevention			0
" @entity153 , the founder and president of the @entity155 , said that a lack of regulation by the federal government allowed this public health scourge to happen			2
" the bottom line here is there should have been more inspections before the outbreak			2
i know @entity166 is looking at ... legislation to bring more enforcement , " @entity153 , who said he 's been a poultry farmer for 14 years , said on tuesday 's " @entity165			2
" speaking on a conference call with reporters monday afternoon , @entity150 commissioner @entity169 said federal regulations that took effect in july could have prevented the situation			0
the new regulations went into effect july 9 requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella			2
the current outbreak began in may and was traced to two @entity75 farms , according to the @entity150			2
one of them , @entity76 , has recalled 380 million eggs ; the other , @entity97 , recalled 170 million eggs			2
" we believe that had these rules been in place at an earlier time , it would have very likely enabled us to identify the problems on this farm before this kind of outbreak occurred , " @entity169 said			0
while @entity150 inspectors typically did n't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness , @entity197 , the associate commissioner for food safety at the @entity150 , said under the new rule , " we will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the @entity84			0
" food safety regulators do n't expect any more recalls after last week 's withdrawal of about 550 million eggs from the @entity84 market , but inspections are still going on			1
@entity197 would not release details of the inspections , which also involve a third operation that supplied the two egg producers , but the results could be released later this week , he said			0
while the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs , they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the @entity84 each year , said @entity221 , director of the food safety program at the @entity223			0
the @entity223 is run by @entity224 , a trade group that describes itself as a cooperative of egg farmers from all across the @entity84 , representing the ownership of approximately 95 percent of all the nation 's egg - laying hens			0
@entity0 senior medical producer @entity230 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's health department believes it has discovered the earliest outbreak there
@entity103 's first related case was as early as may 5
