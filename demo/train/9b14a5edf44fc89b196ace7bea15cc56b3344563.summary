nearly 7 in 10 @entity2 are angry at the direction the country is headed and 53 % of @entity2 disapprove of president @entity6 's job performance , two troubling signs for @entity8 one week before the midterm elections , a new @entity1 / @entity0 shows			1
democrats are battling to try and save the @entity12 majority , while hoping to prevent more losses in the @entity14 , which the @entity15 controls by a 234 to 201 margin			1
in the @entity12 , @entity15 need a net gain of six seats , and several state polls in the past month of contested races show that @entity8 are in danger of losing control of the majority , and thus @entity24			1
currently , @entity8 control the @entity12 by a 55 - 45 margin with two of those seats held by independents that align themselves politically with @entity8			0
the @entity1 / @entity0 poll shows that 30 % of @entity2 are " very angry " and 38 % are " somewhat angry " about the way things are going in the country , while 31 % expressed " no anger " at all			1
@entity1 polling director @entity35 notes the 31 % of " very angry " @entity2 matches the mood of the country in 2010 when @entity15 took back control of the @entity14			1
in next week 's election , the emotion of anger could be a motivating factor in driving out @entity15 voters			0
while 36 % of @entity15 voters said they are " extremely " or " very enthusiastic , " about voting this year , only 26 % of @entity8 use that language to describe themselves , in the @entity1 / @entity0 poll			2
" that 10 point difference is certain to affect turnout and hurt @entity8 ' chances in marginal districts , " @entity35 said about the 435 @entity14 races on the ballot next tuesday			0
and this enthusiasm gap , coupled with dissatisfaction over how the president is leading the country , is likely to influence the dozen races that will decide which political party controls the @entity12 for the next two years			0
a deeper look into the polling data shows that @entity6 's job performance is only viewed favorably in the @entity61 , 51 % , and in urban areas , 60 %			1
all but one of the races that will decide which party controls the @entity12 in 2015 are located in the three other geographic areas of the country and @entity6 's approval rating is in the low 40 's in each one			1
in the @entity69 , where @entity8 are trying to hold an open @entity12 seat in @entity71 , @entity6 has a 56 % disapproval rating			0
in the @entity73 , where three @entity8 incumbents are battling for re-election in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity15 are trying to hold an open seat in @entity80 , as well as protect @entity12 minority leader @entity82 in @entity83 , the president has a 52 % disapproval rating			0
in the @entity86 where @entity8 incumbents are fighting for another six year term in @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity6 's disapproval rating is 55 %			2
making matters even more difficult for @entity8 is that @entity6 's disapproval rating among rural voters is 70 % and the eight states listed above have sizable rural populations			2
nationally , when asked if they agree with @entity6 on issues that matter most to them , only 42 % said yes , while 55 % said they disagreed with him , in the poll			0
poll : @entity101 trails @entity15 challenger in @entity103 it is no surprise that @entity6 has purposely stayed away from campaigning for @entity12 candidates in difficult contests			2
it is widely believed that @entity8 seats in @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 will be won by republicans in november			0
if this were to happen , @entity15 will only need a net gain of three more seats to take back the @entity12 majority			1
as for @entity24 , only 13 % of @entity2 approve of how it is handling its job , while 85 % disapprove .			0

a new @entity1 poll finds large *swaths* of @entity2 angry at the direction of the country
@entity15 need a net gain of six seats to win control of the @entity12
a majority of @entity2 do *n't* approve of @entity6 's job performance
