editor 's note : @entity2 , an award - winning journalist and author , joined now on @entity5 as senior correspondent in 2005			1
@entity2 , who formerly covered urban affairs for @entity8 , also serves as anchor and managing editor of @entity12 's " @entity11 , " a weekly national program reporting on news and culture in the @entity17 community			1
@entity2 says @entity19 's success has helped boost self - confidence for many			1
@entity21 ( @entity8 ) -- it 's a question i never thought i would ask my daughter			1
but i loved being able to ask it			0
" @entity26 ? " " yes , @entity28 , " my 11 - year - old daughter said			1
" tell me what t - shirt you would most like to wear : one that says ' i am a @entity34 , ' ' my mother is a @entity34 ' or ' @entity19 is a @entity34 ' ? " she cocked her head slightly and then quickly said , " i am a @entity34			1
" eleven years old , and this is the vision she already has of herself			0
it 's a pretty wonderful thing to watch that certain something blossom in a girl ... one of those often fleeting moments when a girl owns her own power			2
for me , the decision to wear my own " @entity34 " t - shirt raises all kinds of issues			1
it makes me confront a past that i have known for decades			0
deep down inside , i , like many other @entity50 , struggle with my own very deep insecurities in relation to my white male colleagues			0
i think after witnessing history on television for the past two weeks , those insecurities have pretty much dissipated			0
@entity19 has blazed the trail			1
i ca n't go back to thinking that way , anymore , ever			0
before , when i told people that i was a @entity34 , i never knew what , if any , image they might have in their mind			2
everyone carries stereotypes and preconceived notions			0
but now when i say to people that i am a @entity34 , might they immediately think , " a wise @entity34 " ? my daughter is learning all of these lessons from @entity19 , a @entity70 woman			1
when i was @entity26 's age , back in the ' 70s , the only @entity70 woman i knew of was @entity2 ( played by @entity72 ) from " @entity73			1
" i grew up on the @entity75 of @entity76 after being born in @entity77			0
my @entity2 from @entity73 taught me that love and commitment could transcend borders and divisions			2
@entity19 is teaching @entity26 , and all of us , that intelligence and compassion ( and an honest way with words ) can also cross all borders : political ones , those of gender or ethnicity			1
and i have learned that my own challenge now is to reach this very high bar that @entity19 has set			2
i must " own " that i am , indeed , a wise @entity34			1
later on the day of the t - shirt decision , my daughter hears my reaction when i read that sen. @entity96 , whom my daughter knows well because we followed the election , is going to vote against @entity19 's confirmation			1
" what a big jerk ! " was her age - appropriate response			2
then , after a pause , @entity26 said , " so that means @entity96 thinks @entity103 is a wise woman ? but not @entity19 ? harrumph			1
" " @entity106 " is also an age - appropriate response			2
but the lasting impact of @entity96 's decision will be much more profound than upsetting an 11 - year - old wise @entity34 girl			1
in fact , i would venture to say that , politically , there are many in the @entity113 who are convinced this was a politically unwise choice by @entity96			2
it 's just not that complicated			0
look at the changing demographics in the @entity119			0
then think about what happens when you vote against the first @entity123 nominee			0
maybe @entity96 is n't wise enough to see that reality , so i will tell him a story about a @entity127 - born , @entity119 citizen cabby from my @entity129 neighborhood			1
while he drove down @entity130 , i asked the cabby if he thought that president @entity132 was pandering to the @entity17 communities across the country with the @entity19 nomination			1
" @entity136 ! " he exclaimed in a true @entity127 style			0
" he is not pandering			0
he owes us ! everyone knows now that without the @entity17 vote , you can not win the presidency			2
he has to deliver , politically			0
i am a new citizen , and i voted for @entity132 my first time			0
just like a bunch of us @entity127 cabbies			0
now this is my country and my politics			0
" " and is that the way you guys talk amongst yourselves ? that the @entity17 vote is that powerful ? " " @entity152 , asi lo vemos			2
that 's how we see it ! but even though we love @entity19 , @entity132 still owes us			1
" and what must @entity132 deliver to satisfy this very politically astute cabby ? " @entity158 ! he must solve this immigration problem			0
so @entity132 must understand that is what we want him to deliver now			0
" a wise latino with some wise advice for the president			0
and for @entity96 and the @entity113 ? @entity169 , winning the next elections ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : my daughter and i are wearing " wise @entity34 " t - shirts
she says @entity19 has helped erase insecurity for many
she says @entity96 's *opposition* to @entity19 's nomination was a *mistake*
@entity2 : political impact of @entity17 *population* is likely to grow
