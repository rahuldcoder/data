-- the @entity1 has thrown an awards lifeline to " @entity3			1
" the group does n't choose a best picture , it only ranks the 10 best movies of the year and lists them alphabetically , and this year 's list could easily mirror the eventual best - picture field for the @entity10			1
the six locks for a nomination â € ” " @entity13 , " " @entity14 , " " @entity15 , " " @entity16 , " " @entity17 " and " @entity18 " â € ” are all on @entity1 's list			2
but the @entity10 could select anywhere from five to 10 nominees , and with so many worthy contenders this year the list is likely to go long			1
so could @entity1 's choices be a good gauge for what might fill those other four slots ? if you 're @entity29 , you 've got to hope so			0
when the @entity31 expanded its best picture field three years ago , it was in part due to the feeling that " @entity36 " was best - picture worthy , but fell just short			1
including more movies , including pop favorites like that one , was seen as a way to excite more viewers about the telecast			0
@entity44 and @entity45 critics hand out awards but so far , " @entity3 " has n't generated the same awards heat			0
it 's in the conversation , for sure , but this is also a stellar year for films and competition is fierce			0
among the other movies jockeying for a slot on the best picture list are " @entity56 , " " @entity57 " and " @entity58 " â € ” which are also on @entity1 's list			2
the choice by the @entity1 jury , made up of scholars , and film and tv professions , to include " @entity3 " gives that movie a much - needed jolt of adrenaline in the awards race			2
@entity10 voters are certainly aware of the film , and @entity29 and company have been out campaigning for it a lot lately , but the @entity1 mention should remind those @entity31 members to give it some consideration for best of the year			1
