-- @entity3 noise - pop duo @entity2 and @entity4 , aka @entity4 , may have just released " @entity6 , " the follow - up to their critically acclaimed debut , " treats , " but , believe it or not , they have only written one song together so far			1
" @entity14 , " the lead single and last song that made it to " @entity6 , " was their first collaborative effort			1
as @entity4 ' story of origin goes : @entity2 , a former guitarist for the @entity21 hardcore band @entity20 , was writing what would become " treats " while waiting tables in @entity24			1
he served @entity4 , a former teen - pop singer , and her mother			1
@entity2 mentioned he was looking for a singer for his unfinished demos and @entity31 ' mom stepped in to broker the deal			1
@entity2 and @entity31 recorded " treats " and , within a year , they went from strangers to the pair behind one of the best albums of 2010			1
at the same time the group was taking off , @entity2 was struggling with both the sudden death of his father in a motorcycle crash and his mother being diagnosed with cancer			1
he wrote everything but " @entity14 " during this dark period			1
" ' @entity6 ' is n't a clever title , " he has said			1
" that 's what i felt like i was going through the last two years			1
" now , things are looking up			1
@entity2 's mother is doing well , the album has scored top reviews , @entity4 performed on " @entity52 " and @entity2 is already working on new material			1
for their third album , he says , @entity31 ' influence will be much more obvious			1
in the meantime , the band is opening for the @entity59 on tour and they have announced more summer shows			1
@entity0 : how did coming up through the @entity21 hardcore scene affect what we hear in @entity4 today ? @entity2 : that 's the music that was happening in my backyard and it was a great outlet for all of the directionless anger and aggression that young men have when you hit puberty			1
just angry at the world for no g -- d --- reason			1
hardcore was perfect for me			1
up until that point , i was as determined to become a professional surfer , but after i got a guitar , it took over my entire life			1
i just never left my room			1
and it has n't really changed since			1
i mean , i 've since become a producer and gotten into beat making , but that was it			2
@entity0 : since you had n't worked with @entity90 before " treats , " was there a particular a-ha moment when you knew there was something to your collaboration ? @entity2 : i could hear it			1
i 'm not saying that i knew the music was really good , i 'm just saying that i knew it deserved to exist			2
i did n't how it would be received , but i knew that , at the very least , i had broken through that wall of mediocrity that i had been smashing myself against for so long			2
i was like , oh my @entity104 , finally			2
this is what i 've been waiting for			2
i ca n't tell you how excited i was			2
it came at a very dark time and i just completely made it my life			1
the whole thing seemed so improbable			2
i had been waiting tables for four years			2
i was the waiter who was going to make records and i 'd tell anyone and everyone			2
and they were like , yeah , yeah , that 's nice			2
an old @entity20 fan came in to the restaurant and recognized me			2
he had a @entity20 tattoo and i showed my manager ; i was like , look , this is my old band ! see ? and he 'd be like , that 's very nice mr. @entity2 , but can you please bus table 22 ? @entity0 : it seems like from the moment you two hooked up , success with @entity4 came very quickly			1
did it feel that way for you as well ? @entity2 : i 'm comfortable with the perception that it happened very quickly , even though i know how hard i worked on it for so many years and how much growing i had to do , how many horrible mediocre songs i wrote and threw away			1
but nobody needs to hear about that			2
from the outside looking in , it looks like it happened very quickly			2
i think the reason we 've been able to really sustain it and turn it into something other than a flash in the pan is because there 's a lot of work and a lot of serious focus			2
i was working very hard for it for a long time and failing			2
@entity0 : what did you learn from the success of " treats " that you brought into " @entity6 " ? @entity2 : creatively , it was as simple as having a guitar in my hands every night			1
that is a boring answer , but before we went on tour for " treats , " i had n't been on tour since i was 22 and i got into production			1
all i was thinking about was rhythm and i was making a lot of beats , then suddenly i 'm on tour for 15 months playing guitar on stage every night			1
it was just by proximity that i just started writing on guitar again			2
@entity0 : what were some of your influences ? @entity2 : lyrically , i worked through a lot of the stuff that was f -- king my head up on " @entity6 " and it helped me grow			1
this is borderline corny , but it was really therapeutic			2
it was like one long therapy session for me , just sort of working out some things			0
" hysteria , " the @entity196 record , had a really strong grip on me			0
i love the songs , but especially the production as well			0
what @entity199 put on that record , i was obsessed with			0
but i 'm moving away from those influences			0
i 've been working on a ton of new stuff and branching out so it 's an exciting time			0
i 'm in a much better headspace and i think that that 's reflected in the new stuff , which obviously wo n't be out for a little while , but the spark is there			0
@entity0 : what direction will the new material be taking ? @entity2 : i 'm going to be collaborating a lot more with @entity90 this time around			1
we got a lot closer on " @entity6 , " but really the last song we worked on was " @entity14			1
" i sort of just gave her the instrumental			0
i had the lyric and half an idea for a melody , but that 's our first true collaboration and it 's my favorite song on the record			1
i think really we have not utilized any of her talents			0
she is incredibly gifted when it comes to coming up with really memorable melodies , what i consider to be great melodies			0
there 's so much of her in " @entity14 " and i love it			1
i happen to play in a band with her , but i 'm also a fan			0
@entity0 : so you do n't ever resent her getting more attention than you even when you created the whole band and the music initially ? @entity2 : i actually push that , to be honest			1
we just did the cover of @entity245			0
when i saw that it 's just a beautiful portrait of her , i was like , yes ! thank @entity104 ! i 'm not self - loathing or particularly insecure in my day - to - day , but i really hate being photographed			0
i hate looking at pictures of myself			0
i immediately just start tearing it apart			0
it 's a lot like the creative process as well			0
i 'm just really , really hard on myself			0
i like having her be the face of the band			0
she loves performing and she loves being photographed and she loves making videos			0
she looks great and she 's confident			0
i 'm the polar opposite			0
even live , i 'm never front - lit. i prefer to have the music speak for me			0
@entity0 : how was it for you to perform on " @entity52 " ? @entity2 : i did n't want to do " snl , " but we could n't say no. you 're a total a * * hole if you turn it down			1
the only reason not to do it would be fear of failure			0
like i said before , i know failure very well			0
i do n't want to get into it , but i was particularly unimpressed by our performance			0
i watched it once and i 'll never watch it again			0
but " @entity52 " was an incredible experience			0
@entity0 : how did opening for the @entity59 on tour come about ? @entity2 : flea came out to a show in @entity24 and somebody introduced him to me			1
he was like , hey , i 'm flea			0
i obviously knew who he was			0
he was incredibly nice and he was like , would you guys be interested in playing shows with my band ? i was like , you mean the @entity59 ? sure ! it was literally that simple			0
there was no politicking , no agents or anything			0
it was just dude to dude			0
i think they 're all going to be really great people and i 'm pretty psyched on it			0
they 're one of the biggest touring bands on @entity293 , which is a strange sentence			0
they 're , like , top two or three on the planet			0
i 'm interested to see how a production like that works .			0
