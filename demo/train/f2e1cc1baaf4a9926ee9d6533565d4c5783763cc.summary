@entity1 president @entity0 made clear what he meant when he said @entity3 should be " wiped off " the map and touched on everything from the @entity6 to homosexuality in a wide - ranging interview that aired monday on @entity10 's " @entity9			1
" the president , speaking through a translator , also said what his country would do if attacked by @entity3 , and he slammed an anti-islam film that has triggered protests in the @entity18 world			1
" if a group comes and occupies the @entity20 , destroys homes while women and children are in those homes , incarcerate the youth of @entity20 , impose five different wars on many neighbors , and always threaten others , what would you do ? what would you say ? would you help it ? ... or would you help the people of the @entity20 ? " @entity0 asked in response to whether @entity3 should be " wiped off " the face of the map , as he once said			1
@entity37 confronts @entity1 , @entity38 at @entity39 " so when we say ' to be wiped , ' we say for occupation to be wiped off from this world			1
for war - seeking to ( be ) wiped off and eradicated , the killing of women and children to be eradicated			2
and we propose the way			2
the path is to recognize the right of the @entity50 to self - governance			2
" when asked whether he believes in a two - state solution to the @entity3 - @entity50 conflict , @entity0 declined to comment			1
" i can not express an opinion			2
that is their prerogative , " @entity0 said			1
" but the people of @entity59 must be allowed by everyone , and helped by everyone , to allow them , to give them the right to choose for themselves			2
" in @entity65 this week to visit the @entity39 , @entity0 spoke at a meeting on the rule of law monday and is scheduled to address the @entity68 on wednesday			1
@entity39 @entity69 ban ki - moon met with the @entity1 president over the weekend and warned him of the " potentially harmful consequences of inflammatory rhetoric , " according to a @entity39 statement			1
during his speech monday , @entity0 accused " some members of the @entity83 with veto rights " of having " chosen silence with regard to the nuclear warheads of a fake regime , while at the same time they impede scientific progress of other nations			1
" though he did n't name the countries , he was clearly talking about the @entity20 , @entity3 and his own country			2
some world powers , particularly @entity89 nations , suspect that @entity1 is seeking to build nuclear weapons			1
@entity91 insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			2
when asked by @entity10 's @entity94 what @entity1 would do if @entity3 were to attack it , @entity0 said , " any nation has the right and will indeed defend herself			1
" " but my question is this : why should the world be managed in such a way that an individual can allow himself to threaten a rich and deeply rooted historical , ancient country such as @entity1 ? a great country , such as @entity1 , based on an excuse of his own fabrication			1
... another country can say , ' i am guessing that country @entity110 is doing activity @entity113 , therefore i will attack that country ' ... can this be ... a successful formula for the management of the world ? " again there , the president was likely referring to @entity1 's disputed nuclear program			1
asked whether he feared a war or military conflict with @entity3 was imminent , @entity0 said : " the @entity123 are very much , very adventuresome , very much seeking to fabricate things , and i think they see themselves at the end of the line and i do firmly believe that they seek to create new opportunities for themselves and their adventurous behaviors			1
" among other topics the president touched on in the interview taped in @entity65 over the weekend were : anti-islam film @entity0 denounced the film , " @entity135 , " that portrays the @entity136 as a womanizer , child molester and killer			1
the online video has led to a wave of global unrest			2
" fundamentally , first of all , any action that is provocative , offends the religious thoughts and feelings of any people , we condemn , " he said			0
photos : anti- @entity20 demonstrations worldwide " likewise , we condemn any type of extremism			0
of course , what took place was ugly			0
offending the @entity154 is quite ugly			0
this has very little or nothing to do with freedom and freedom of speech			0
this is the weakness of and the abuse of freedom , and in many places it is a crime			0
it should n't take place , and i do hope the day will come in which politicians will not seek to offend those whom others hold holy , " @entity0 said			1
" we also believe that this must also be resolved in a humane atmosphere , in a participatory environment , and we do not like anyone losing their lives or being killed for any reason , anywhere in the world			0
" the privately produced film sparked protests against the @entity20 , where it was made			2
while most of the demonstrations have been peaceful , some were marred by violence that has left more than two dozen people dead -- among them @entity20 ambassador to @entity189 @entity188 and three other @entity20 killed in an attack on the consulate in @entity192 , @entity189 , that reportedly followed a demonstration against the film			2
when asked by @entity94 whether he thought protesters should stop threatening @entity20 staff abroad , @entity0 said he can not say what other people or nations should do , but that he believes " extremism gives birth to following and subsequent extremists			1
" @entity38 a long - time supporter of embattled @entity38 president @entity204 , @entity0 told @entity10 's @entity94 the crisis in @entity38 must be resolved through dialogue , and without outside interference			1
he condemned the violence , which has left more than 26,000 people dead since march 2011 , according to opposition activists			0
" we must all say enough of this violence , right now , " @entity0 said , adding that he is working to organize a group to bring the two sides together			1
" we do believe that freedom , the right to choose , the right to vote , respect and justice is the fundamental right of all people			0
all people must obtain these rights			0
no one has the right to restrict a people and nation , but we believe as a friend of nations , we must help the nations around the world to obtain these rights through peaceful paths , though peaceful actions			0
" the @entity6 the conversation was contentious at times , particularly when the topic turned to the @entity239 extermination of the @entity240 last century			1
@entity0 has long questioned the existence of the @entity6			1
" i pass no judgment about historic events			0
i defend the human freedoms			0
whatever event has taken place throughout history , or has n't taken place , i can not judge that			0
why should i judge that ? i say researchers and scholars must be free to conduct research and analysis about any historical event , " the @entity1 president said			1
homosexuality " i 'm sorry			0
let me ask you this			0
do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality ? homosexuality ceases procreation			0
who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly , and others do not accept your behavior , that they 're denying your freedom ? " he asked @entity94			1
" proper education must be given ... the education system must be revamped			0
the political system must be revamped			0
and these must be also reformed , revamped along the way			0
but if you , if a group recognizes an ugly behavior or ugly deed as legitimate , you must not expect other countries or other groups to give it the same recognition			0
" jews when asked how he would feel if one of his children dated a jew , @entity0 replied , " i would have to see who that @entity240 man or woman would be			2
i see love amongst people as completely acceptable			0
there are many @entity240 living in @entity1 with whom we are very close			2
there are ... some @entity296 that marry into @entity240 families or marry @entity299			0
" " i -- we have no such problems , " he added			0
" of course , i think none of us should represent the whole population of the @entity20 , but we believe that color , religion , native tongue , ethnic background should n't create differences or distances between people , nor should it be the sole reason to bring people closer together			0
it has always been like this			0
" @entity314 @entity0 also discussed his reaction to @entity314 's death last year by @entity317 under president @entity37			1
" i would have been happier to see a transparent trial , a formal trial , and find out the root causes of all of the events of the last few years , " the @entity1 president said			1
