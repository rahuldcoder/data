@entity0 -- some state - run enterprises in @entity3 have opulent headquarters more suited to the court of @entity6 of @entity7 , while other local government - owned buildings even replicate the home of the @entity10			1
clearly , in recent decades , money has been no object in the world 's second biggest economy			0
but @entity16 's bean counters , a more socially - aware bunch in recent times , have decided enough is enough and imposed a ban on the construction of new government buildings , according to state media			1
a yawning gap between rich and poor and a social media - led backlash against corruption and official excesses , has made the ruling @entity28 led by president @entity29 all too aware of the perils of continuing down such a corrosive path			1
opinion : corruption as @entity3 's top priority and so the @entity40 ( @entity28 ) @entity37 and the @entity38 of the @entity39 jointly issued a directive that calls for an across - the - board halt to the construction of new government buildings , training centers or hotels in the coming five years , the @entity36 news agency reported			1
the directive accuses some departments and localities of breaking building regulations when approving , and calls on all @entity28 and government bodies to be " frugal and ensure that government funds and resources are spent on developing the economy and boosting the public 's well - being , " @entity36 said			1
expensive and unnecessary renovations will also be prohibited , with only projects that " erase safety risks " or " restore office functions , " allowed			0
ominously , the directive says officials who approve banned projects should be " harshly punished			0
" perhaps the best example of the type of extravagant constructions being targeted is in northeastern @entity3 , where the state - owned @entity66 has its main offices			1
the remarkable complex is modeled on the @entity69 outside @entity70 , @entity7 and features incredible ornate hallways with crystal chandeliers and gold paneling along the walls			2
since coming to power late last year , president @entity29 has made corruption and excess his chief targets			0
in several speeches since he officially took over the reins of the @entity28 in november , he warned that corruption could lead to " the collapse of the party and the downfall of the state			0
" he has repeatedly urged officials to " build a clean government , show self - discipline and restrain their relatives and associates			2
" according to @entity36 , the new building ban is an important part of " building a more transparent government and strengthening ties between the @entity28 and the public			2
" " in order to let the people live comfortably , the government has to tighten its belt and cut its own spending , " said professor @entity96 from the @entity97 , in quotes carried by @entity36 .			0
