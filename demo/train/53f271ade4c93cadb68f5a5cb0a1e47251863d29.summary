president @entity0 in an exclusive interview with the @entity2 released saturday laid responsibility for the government shutdown squarely at the feet of house speaker @entity6			1
" we can vote to open the government today , " @entity0 told the @entity2 in the wide - ranging interview			1
" we know that there are enough members in the @entity12 -- democrats and @entity14 -- who are prepared to vote to reopen the government today			1
the only thing that is keeping that from happening is speaker @entity6 has made a decision that he is going to hold out to see if he can get additional concessions from us			0
" much of the government has been shut down -- more than 800,000 workers furloughed , national parks closed , programs for programs from child care to space exploration shuttered -- for five days			2
and it 's likely to remain closed for several days if not weeks more , @entity12 @entity14 concede			0
despite public pressure to reach a resolution -- and statements from politicians that they want to -- @entity35 's political machinery has been gridlocked			0
and there 's little indication there will be any breakthrough until at least mid-october , when the next economic crisis comes up over whether @entity41 will give the federal government the ok to increase how much it can borrow or default on its debt			1
@entity0 , in the @entity2 interview , said he did not expect the latter to occur			1
" there were at least some quotes yesterday that speaker @entity6 is willing to make sure that we do n't default , " he said in the interview , which was taped friday			2
" and just as is true with the government shutdown , there are enough votes in the @entity12 to make sure that the government reopens today			1
" and i 'm pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the @entity12 right now to make sure that the @entity58 does n't end up being a deadbeat			0
the only thing that 's preventing that from happening is speaker @entity6 calling the vote			0
" @entity6 , speaking to reporters friday , tried to ratchet up pressure on @entity0 to end the crisis by acceding to his demand that he negotiate changes to @entity68 as part of any deal			1
fuming about a @entity72 report that cited an unidentified @entity0 administration official as saying " we are winning , " @entity6 said , " this is n't some damn game ! " much of the opposition to the administration 's efforts has been led by sympathizers of the tea party , who are seeking a reduction in the national debt and the federal budget deficit , as well as a reduction in @entity58 government spending and taxes			1
asked whether the @entity81 members are good or bad for the country , @entity0 told the @entity2 he was more concerned about their tactics than about their positions			1
" it 's this idea that if they do n't get 100 % of their way , they 'll shut down the government or they 'll threaten economic chaos , " he said			0
" that has to stop			0
" @entity68 glitches the government shutdown occurred when @entity0 refused to give in to @entity14 demands that he delay or change the @entity68 , the signature achievement of his first term that began enrolling patients on october 1			1
@entity0 said he did not know how many people had signed up for the plan , also known as @entity68			1
he acknowledged that computer glitches have snarled the process for some , but urged them not to give up			0
" my message to them would be , each day the wait times are reduced , " he said			0
but the program is not going to be affected by the budget negotiations , he said			0
" the obsession with the @entity68 , with @entity68 , has to stop , " he added			1
" that is not something that should be a price for keeping the government open			2
" @entity0 contrasted his own low - profile behavior during his single term in the @entity122 with that of some current first - term senators , who include republicans @entity125 of @entity126 , @entity127 of @entity128 and @entity129 of @entity130 -- all of whom have been outspoken in their opposition to @entity68			1
" i did n't go around courting the media , and i certainly did n't go around trying to shut down the government , " he said			0
" and so i recognize that in today 's media age , being controversial , taking controversial positions , rallying the most extreme parts of your base -- whether it 's left or right -- is a lot of times the fastest way to get attention or raise money , but it 's not good for government			2
it 's not good for the people we 're supposed to be serving			0
" thoughts on @entity152 the @entity2 interview also touched on the question of @entity152 's nuclear program and the overtures made last month by president @entity157 at the @entity159 meeting in @entity160			1
" nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in @entity152 's security and defense doctrine , and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions , " @entity157 told the world body			2
@entity0 said the @entity58 should test such overtures			2
" i think @entity157 has staked his position on the idea that he can improve relations with the rest of the world , " @entity0 said			2
" and so far , he 's been saying a lot of the right things			0
and the question now is , can he follow through ? " @entity0 said the @entity58 view is that @entity152 is at least a year away from being able to produce a nuclear weapon , double the six months cited this week by @entity182 prime minister @entity181 , who has expressed deep distrust of @entity185 's intentions -- calling @entity186 " a wolf in sheep 's clothing			1
" " what i 've said to prime minister @entity181 is that the entire point of us setting up sanctions and putting pressure on the @entity152 economy was to bring them to the table in a serious way to see if we can resolve this issue diplomatically , " @entity0 said			1
" and we 've got to test that			0
we 're not going to take a bad deal			0
we are going to make sure that we verify any agreement that we might strike			0
" one more thing ... though much of the interview focused on the sport of politics , it ended on the politics of sport			0
asked about the @entity214 , a name some people consider to be insulting to @entity217 , the nation 's first black president said he would be open to changing the name if he owned the team			1
" i do n't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real , legitimate concerns that people have about these things , " he said			0
but @entity0 added that there was little chance he would wind up owning a football team			2
if he were to own any professional sports team after leaving the presidency , @entity0 said , it would more likely be a basketball team .			2

" we can vote to open the government today , " @entity0 tells the @entity2
the nation is in its fifth day of a federal shutdown
but @entity0 does not expect the nation will default
