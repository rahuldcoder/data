@entity0 -- as @entity4 companies hear the siren call of the @entity7 consumer , they better heed the cautionary tale of @entity9			1
@entity10 spent millions opening a six - story flagship store in @entity12 to great fanfare to bring the doll franchise to @entity7 in 2009			1
two years later , it closed its doors			0
" @entity9 spent a lot of money setting up a boutique in the most fashionable part of @entity12 , where you could go and have all of your @entity9 needs met			0
you could have a fashion consultation , you could of course buy lots of @entity9 dolls , " said @entity22 , author of " as @entity23 : how @entity7 consumers are transforming everything			1
" however , " they did n't think long and hard enough about whether @entity7 girls wanted to look sexy or they wanted to look something closer to what you 'd associate with @entity33 -- cute , " @entity22 added			1
" so @entity34 is doing well , but @entity9 is an example of crash and burn			0
" it 's a lesson in localization rather than grafting tried - and - true @entity4 business plans to the @entity7 market , " on @entity7 " experts told @entity1 's @entity42			1
as @entity7 's ranks of consumers swell -- the number of middle class earners is estimated to grow 70 % to 600 million by 2020 -- so too rises the stakes for companies looking to cash into @entity7 's growing consumer market			1
" it 's very important for the @entity4 brands to not simply take an existing strategy or operations and try to take it into @entity7 market , " said @entity50 , director of international business development for @entity52			1
" you always have to be very flexible , be reactive to consumers ' requirements and demands			0
" one company that 's done it right , @entity63 said , is @entity66			1
" they really localize their products to fit @entity7 consumers ' taste -- and not only the coffee itself ... they have pastry dedicated to @entity7 flavors , ( such as ) dedicated products for the @entity68 , " said @entity63 , referring to traditional cuisine during @entity7 's @entity68			1
" they are trying to adapt their coffee into a traditional @entity7 tea house			2
and it really blends the @entity82 meets @entity84 culture			0
" one area where @entity4 brands have some headway against their domestic @entity7 competitors is product safety , in the wake of scandals over tainted baby formula , fake eggs and exploding watermelons			2
@entity95 said his company , @entity96 , interviewed 5,000 @entity7 consumers in 15 cities last year			1
" their biggest concern in life , ahead of being able to pay education for their kids , or for medical care cost for their families , was food and product safety , " @entity95 said			0
" they 're absolutely petrified of biting something and dying , or getting toxic shock syndrome from a toy			0
so what we 've found is in these 5,000 consumers they trust foreign brands far more than they trust local domestic @entity7 brands , " @entity95 said			1
a dichotomy is growing in @entity7 consumer trends between shopping for status and shopping for value			2
" what that means is , people do n't buy mid-level brands , which is why you see ( brands ? ) like @entity131 , or @entity132 , or @entity134 kind of struggle , because these are branded for middle - class consumers , " @entity95 said			0
" what we see is people either shop for the most expensive things they can get , like a @entity143 or @entity144 bag , or they go for the cheapest			0
" still , there is a growing individualism in consumer tastes -- and a widening gap for new players to enter the market , the experts said			2
" so for brand managers , now is the best time to come to @entity7 , " @entity95 advised			2
" because people are no longer being monopolized by the same five brands			0
you know , you do n't have to have a @entity158 ( watch ) any more -- now maybe you can buy something from @entity160			0
" @entity1 's @entity42 contributed to this report			0
