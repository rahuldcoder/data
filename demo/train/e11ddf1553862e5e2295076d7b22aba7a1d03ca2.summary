@entity0 , @entity1 -- just hours after the @entity6 warned that @entity7 would achieve nothing with threats or provocations , @entity5 moved a long - range rocket it plans to test fire to a launch pad monday , a @entity4 official said			1
a @entity6 official said the @entity6 also has seen signs the @entity7 are preparing to launch a long - range rocket			1
the news broke at the start of a two - day nuclear summit in @entity0 that is bringing together leaders from the @entity6 , @entity21 , @entity22 and dozens of other nations to discuss how to deal with nuclear terrorism and how to secure the world 's nuclear material			1
overshadowing the summit 's message of international cooperation was an announcement by @entity7 that it plans to carry out a rocket - powered satellite launch in mid-april			1
@entity1 has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear - armed missile , while @entity6 president @entity35 said monday such a launch would bring repercussions			1
" here in @entity7 , i want to speak directly to the leadership in @entity5			2
the @entity6 has no hostile intent toward your country , " @entity35 said during a speech to students at @entity0 's @entity41			2
" but by now it should be clear , your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek			2
" @entity1 president @entity52 said monday his country would " thoroughly retaliate against @entity7 " if provoked			1
if the rocket is launched , @entity1 is prepared to " track its trajectory , " said the @entity57 official , who did not want to be named			1
" there are concerns that parts of the rocket may fall within @entity1 territory , " he said			1
" if that were to happen it would threaten lives and cause damage to the economy			0
to guard against that , they ( the military ) will be tracking the orbit			0
" the rocket was moved to a launch pad in the northeastern portion of @entity75 , a village in northwest @entity7 , the @entity1 official said			1
@entity7 says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch			1
prior to @entity35 's speech , @entity5 said it will see any statement critical of its nuclear program as " a declaration of war			0
" using ballistic missile technology is in violation of @entity88 and against a deal @entity7 struck with the @entity6 earlier this month that , in return for food aid , it would not carry out nuclear or missile tests			1
" there will be no rewards for provocations			0
those days are over , " @entity35 said in his speech			0
" to the leaders of @entity5 i say , this is the choice before you			0
this is the decision that you must make			0
today we say , @entity5 , have the courage to pursue peace and give a better life to the people of @entity7			2
" the @entity88 nuclear watchdog agency 's director general , @entity107 , said the @entity6 - @entity7 deal is " not over " despite @entity5 's plans to launch the rocket			1
" we have established contact at a working level , and they are keeping contact with the @entity7 mission in @entity117 , " @entity107 said			2
" nothing has been decided yet			0
" he said the @entity120 needs to consult with @entity7 and other parties involved in the multilateral talks , known as the six - party talks			1
@entity35 's wide - ranging speech also touched on the @entity6 commitment to further cut its stockpile of nuclear weapons , and he issued a stern warning to @entity129			1
the president said sanctions have led to the " slowing " of @entity134 's nuclear program			0
but it remains a concern			0
while the president did n't specify the course of action if @entity129 does not comply with international demands and produces nuclear weapons , he left little leeway for @entity134 's leaders			0
" @entity129 must act with the seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands			0
@entity129 must meet its obligations , " @entity35 said			0
later , @entity35 met with his @entity21 counterpart , @entity151 , and the two agreed that there is a window of opportunity to pursue diplomacy and that @entity129 should take advantage of it , @entity152 , one of @entity35 's deputy national security advisers , told reporters			0
the two leaders also agreed the proposed launch by @entity7 would be a violation of @entity88 resolutions , he said			1
" there is agreement that provocative acts like this will only increase isolation going forward , " @entity152 said			0
the rocket launch site is near the @entity22 border			1
@entity22 has somewhat of a diplomatic relationship with @entity7 , though the relationship between the two countries is limited because of @entity5 's routine provocations			1
as a result , @entity7 's planned launch was front and center in a meeting between @entity35 and @entity22 's president , @entity181			1
" the two leaders agreed to coordinate closely to this potential provocation , and registering our serious concerns , " @entity152 said			0
the two also agreed there is a broad view in the international community that a satellite launch would be destabilizing , he said			2
@entity35 and @entity181 also discussed @entity7 's new leadership , " this being a sensitive time on the @entity192 , and this being a new leader who is going to take some lessons from what works and what does n't , " @entity152 said			2
@entity7 leader @entity198 took over from his father following the latter 's death in december			2
" that 's a conversation president @entity35 had with both @entity22 and @entity21 , " @entity152 said			2
" ... i think they also share a frustration with the choices the new leadership has made as well			0
" @entity2 's @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
