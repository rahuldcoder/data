this autumn sees the 25th anniversary of the fall of the @entity3			1
in the world of today , it can be hard to recall that the collapse of @entity8 communism left @entity10 prestige at a major high			1
so great was the shift to what was termed @entity19 's " unipolar moment " that some , such as @entity16 foreign minister @entity15 , quickly warned of the dangers of @entity19 's " hyperpower "			0
a quarter of a century on , the @entity10 remains the most powerful country in the world -- certainly in a military sense			1
it can still project and deploy overwhelming force relative to any probable enemy			0
however , @entity19 is not , to use a term of art in international relations , an all - powerful hegemonic power			2
this core fact has been demonstrated repeatedly throughout the last two - and - a - half decades , from @entity31 in 1993 , @entity32 and @entity33 since 9/11 , and also most recently to @entity34 and @entity35			0
since 1989 , other hopes and expectations of how the @entity38 might look have also been dashed			2
the vision of a universal order of liberal , capitalist , democratic states living in peace and contentment -- as painted by @entity48 and others -- has been replaced by a reality in which authoritarian states such as @entity52 and @entity53 appear to many to be in the ascendancy , so - called @entity40 terrorism has become a significant international concern , and several unstable countries , including @entity57 , have acquired nuclear weaponry			1
this complex picture is reflected in the multiple challenges confronting the @entity10 - led international order today			1
to take just one example , following @entity52 's annexation of @entity66 , @entity19 's relations with @entity63 are now more strained than at any time since 1989 , yet many of its allies in @entity68 remain dependent on @entity52 gas supplies as the continent heads into winter			0
meanwhile , the rise of @entity53 , which is forecast to imminently surpass the @entity10 as the world 's largest economy on purchasing parity terms , is one of the biggest game changers in global affairs since the collapse of the @entity8			1
this development has potential to be either a growing source of tension with @entity19 or develop into a fruitful partnership			0
growing bilateral rivalry , rather than an increasingly cooperative relationship , is especially likely if @entity86 's economic and military power continues to grow rapidly , and its leadership embraces an increasingly assertive foreign policy stance towards its neighbors in @entity90			0
moreover , terrorism remains a threat to @entity10 national interests : more than a dozen years after 9/11 , the @entity95 administration is still engaged in @entity32 and @entity33 to a degree that reduces the ability of the @entity98 to deal with new crises elsewhere			1
meanwhile , the @entity102 - @entity101 peace process has collapsed again , and @entity19 and @entity103 remain locked in nuclear stand - off on the @entity105			2
to be sure , the @entity38 world contains multiple opportunities as well as risks for @entity19 , including the potential forthcoming agreement of the @entity110 with around a dozen countries in the @entity112 and @entity113 that collectively account for about 40 % of world gdp			2
@entity19 hopes that this will embed @entity10 influence in @entity113 and is part of the so - called @entity10 pivot to the region			1
meanwhile , president @entity95 also wants to secure in coming months the @entity120 with the 28 states of the @entity122			0
this would represent the largest regional free trade and investment agreement in history , with the @entity10 and @entity68 accounting for more than 50 % of global gdp , and embed @entity19 's role as guardian of the " rules of the road " for international commerce , as an administration trade official put it recently			1
the fall of the @entity135 is rightly celebrated			0
however , it is possible to detect these days -- and not just in @entity19 -- a certain nostalgia for what is sometimes seen as the greater " strategic stability " of the " simpler " bipolar era that preceded it			0
indisputably , there are a range of significant , complicated challenges to the @entity10 - led order today that were not fully anticipated by many , including @entity48 , when @entity146 collapsed			1
however , rose - tinted recollections for a @entity149 - era need to be put in the context of that fact that the period of @entity10 - @entity8 rivalry from 1947 to 1989 also had some exceptionally dangerous moments			1
perhaps the best example is the @entity156 which was probably the time that the world came closest to nuclear annihilation			0
more generally , while the @entity10 and the @entity8 did not formally engage directly in war , there were multiple proxy battles fought across the world with destabilizing consequences -- far from their borders but deadly to those caught up in them			1
taken overall , despite all the challenges that @entity19 faces today , the country will remain , for the foreseeable future , the primary actor in many theatres across the world			2
while its relative power may erode , it will seek to continue set the international agenda in the political , economic and security spheres and succeed in doing so more often than any other state			0
however , @entity10 success in managing the complexity of global affairs will also increasingly depend upon the cooperation of others , both competitors and allies			2
and a key uncertainty here is the direction of the bilateral relationship in coming years , with a rising @entity53 which could be a force for greater global instability and tension , or much deeper , collaborative strategic partnership .			0

in wake of fall of @entity3 , @entity10 ' prestige was at a major high
25 years on , @entity10 still most powerful country in the world , but status has diminished
@entity203 vision of liberal , capitalist , democratic states living in peace dashed
