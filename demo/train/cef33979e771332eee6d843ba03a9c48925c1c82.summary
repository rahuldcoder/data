-- they feature characters such as hat - wearing cats , very hungry caterpillars , nice girls named @entity6 and naughty boys named @entity8 " @entity11 " by @entity12 turns 40 this year , and 29 million copies of it have sold since 1969			0
parents read them to their children , forming a powerful bond			1
years later , those former children read these children 's picture books to their children , and the thread between generations is extended yet again			1
" children 's books live a long time because you always have children growing into them , " says @entity22 , president of the @entity23 and a retired school librarian			1
" and parents read [ to their children ] what was read to them			1
" the making of a classic is a strange alchemy of skill -- a good story , strong illustrations -- and luck			1
it 's not easy to appeal to three audiences : publishers , parents and -- oh , yes -- children			1
dr. @entity45 ' first children 's book , " @entity49 , " was rejected by more than 25 publishers before @entity47 put it out in 1937			1
@entity50 's legendary " @entity8 " ( 1963 ) , though recognized with the @entity55 -- the highest honor for a picture book -- was controversial for its drawings of monsters and its mischievous hero , @entity8 but almost all classics share some characteristics , says @entity60 , a @entity62 @entity61 professor and member of that @entity66 school 's @entity64 for the @entity67			2
" every one of them ... has the same reassuring pattern of ' home , away , home , ' " she says			2
" the basic plot begins with a happy family situation			0
then one extremely curious or transgressive child goes out on his or her own			0
and , no matter how ' bad ' the child has been , he gets to come back home			0
" the child is welcomed back to the family and often gets something to eat , she adds			0
( one exception : @entity45 ' " @entity87 , " in which the adult condemns the child 's sense of wonder -- but then , she adds , " dr. @entity45 is in a world of his own			1
" ) the plot is n't just reassuring to children , she points out , but also reinforces the lessons of good parenting			1
" if you think of all those stories , there 's a loving parent ... allowing a transgressive kid a leash to investigate the world and come back , " she says			2
and through the child 's eyes , parents find their sense of wonder renewed , she adds			2
