-- can the world agree that 2013 will be the year when a girl 's right to education will finally be won -- even in the most remote and once lawless corners of the globe ? last october , shocked by the attempted murder of the 15 - year - old @entity10 girl @entity9 , three million people around the world rushed to sign a petition demanding universal girls ' education			1
the @entity10 government then agreed for the first time to legislate compulsory free education and provided stipends for three million children			2
only this week @entity19 , a brave 41 - year - old teacher on her way with her child to work at an all girls ' school , was shot dead and joined an ever - lengthening list of teachers and students murdered because of their support for the basic right of girls to go to school			1
the murder demonstrates yet again that in parts of the @entity35 subcontinent , @entity36 , and @entity37 , intimidation and violence are the daily reality of life for many girls who want to go to school and the many educators who want to teach them			1
even today , five months after @entity9 's shooting in the @entity47 , her school friends remain in fear of violence simply for attempting to return to school			1
a new petition , launched this week on @entity51 -- with its first signatories , @entity9 and her father @entity53 -- calls for an immediate tightening of security protection for pupils and teachers when going to school in @entity10			1
it is because of the tragedies that befell @entity9 and her school friends -- and now @entity19 -- that in @entity65 in three weeks ' time the @entity63 and @entity64 will bring together the countries that are off - track in securing universal primary education to devise a plan to move further and faster to universal education by the end of 2015 , the date by which the @entity71 are to be met			1
the atrocity against @entity19 -- murdered only 200 meters from the all - girls school where she taught in @entity76 tribal district -- is a stark reminder of the continuation of the threats , intimidation , shootings , arson attacks and sometimes even murder that are the @entity84 's weapons of a war against girls ' opportunity			1
they also remind us that the silent majority who once stood in the face of these threats will be silent no more and that public revulsion against the violence has strengthened the resolve of girls to go to school			1
over the past several years , @entity10 @entity84 militants have destroyed hundreds of schools in @entity100			2
last year @entity101 showed how @entity102 , the headmistress of a state - run girls ' primary school in the troubled province , was battling to keep girls in school in spite of the threats			2
the film features @entity110 , one of six daughters of a night security guard , determined to secure an education			0
it also tells the story of @entity116 , whose fight to stay in school required her to resist her family 's plan to marry her off at the age of 14			0
what 's happening in @entity10 is also occurring in @entity36 where , despite the removal of the @entity84 from the control of the national government , local teachers and pupils are under pressure to stay away from school			1
last year an investigation was carried out into allegations that @entity84 extremists were poisoning school girls through infecting their school water			2
still women run schools , sometimes going underground , claiming they are offering only sewing lessons			0
there are many reasons why 32 million girls are not at school today			2
for some there are no schools to go to and no teachers			0
seven million are laboring in fields , mines , factories and in domestic service or they have been trafficked			0
others still are child brides , forced out of school and into loveless marriages , often undergoing early pregnancies that put their lives at risk			0
but most of them are victims of unfair discrimination against girls , an assumption that girls do not need to be educated to play their part in the world			0
this week 's tragic killing near the @entity36 border -- just five months after the shooting of @entity9 and her friends on a bus -- also reminds us that the discrimination against girls that provoked @entity9 's shooting has not gone away , and that the struggle of families in @entity9 's own community in the @entity47 is far from over			1
injured with @entity9 were her friends @entity177 , who has had to relearn how to use her left arm and hand , and @entity181			0
i have spoken to them twice on the phone about their desire to continue their education and their ambition to become doctors			0
these sentiments were also expressed to the physician @entity191 in her @entity193 piece			0
according to recent reports that have been sent to me , armed policemen have had to be deployed to the homes of @entity197 and @entity181 as well as other girls to shield them from harm			0
while @entity181 says that things are better than four years ago , it is nonetheless the case that the girls still need police escorts to go to school			1
you can sign the petition supporting the girls and teachers who are demanding they go to school free of intimidation and violence at @entity51			1
on that site you can also see the details of our plans to meet @entity9 's ambition , for every girl should go to school			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			0
