-- it may not have felt like it in the @entity3 , but the world saw its warmest november on record last month , according to new data released tuesday by @entity3 observers			2
the global average temperature for november was just under 56.6 degrees @entity9 ( 13.7 c ) , the @entity11 reported			1
that 's about 1.4 degrees f over the 20th century 's average and the second - highest november mark on land since records started being kept in 1880 , @entity11 said			1
@entity18 was one of the few places that saw below - average temperatures for the month			1
that may be no surprise to @entity3 who were traveling over the snowy , slushy @entity25 holiday , but it put the continent in rare company			0
only southwestern @entity29 , north - central @entity30 and the seas off @entity32 saw a cooler - than - average november , while eastern @entity33 and @entity34 saw much warmer temperatures for the month			2
@entity38 saw a particularly warm november , with parts of @entity40 , the @entity41 and its @entity43 islands recording temperatures up to 14 f ( 8 c ) above an average that dates back to 1891 , @entity11 said			0
the data showed no record lows for the month anywhere on the globe			0
the figures , compiled by @entity11 's @entity50 and @entity51 , include both land and ocean readings			0
they were released less than three months after the @entity55 concluded that global warming was continuing , and that human activity -- particularly the consumption of fossil fuels , which release heat - trapping carbon dioxide -- is largely responsible			0
it 's a controversial notion politically , but one long accepted by most scientists			0
november continued an unbroken string of 345 months of temperatures above the 20th - century average , with 37 consecutive novembers topping that mark , according to @entity11			1
longer - term , the global average for september through november was the second - warmest on record , trailing only 2005 , and the year - to - date figure of @entity71 ( 14.6 c ) is the fourth - warmest on record .			1
