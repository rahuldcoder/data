@entity0 -- @entity3 leaders recently thrashed out a deal aimed at ending months of uncertainty over the future of the euro and resolving an escalating debt crisis that has pushed several economies to the brink of collapse			1
the eurozone fiscal pact has to be ratified by 12 participating nations			1
the @entity14 refused to sign up to the deal and now @entity16 has called a referendum on the treaty -- a decision that could cause difficulties for the agreement			1
so what was originally agreed in the treaty negotiations ? the " fiscal compact " outlines the closer integration of the national budgets of the 17 eurozone countries			1
a new legal framework and greater fiscal scrutiny will be imposed to avoid a repetition of the dubious financial practices that triggered the crisis			2
the treaty also agrees to strengthen mechanisms that guarantee short - term stability to euro economies in hot water			1
the main points are : the legal framework will see those signed up to the deal effectively hand more sovereign powers over to centralized @entity3 control			0
under the new deal , eurozone nations must be deliver " balanced " budgets , designed to ensure there is no repeat of the overspending and under taxation that left @entity51 in need of a bailout			2
all plans to issue national debt must be reported in advance			0
the current @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , the money - lending safety net created by the eurozone last year to combat the crisis , will be phased out in mid- 2013			2
the implementation of the eurozone 's permanent bailout fund , the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , brought forward to 2012 , will run alongside the existing fund for about a year			0
voting rules in the @entity61 will be changed to allow emergency decisions to be passed with an 85 % qualified majority -- an attempt to move away from the deadlock that has stymied earlier bailouts			2
where will the money come from ? bailout money comes from selling bonds guaranteed by eurozone countries			1
the bonds are bought by investors --- which can include countries like @entity79 --- in return for interest			0
the cash raised is then lent to the eurozone countries in trouble			1
the @entity57 was set up in a hurry after @entity51 's may 2010 bailout , and was only ever meant to be temporary			0
its lending firepower has been boosted to € 440 billion from an original € 250 billion			0
the @entity61 will get € 700 billion in funds paid in by eurozone countries relative to the size of their economies			1
that cash will likely come from national treasuries			0
that chunk of cash sitting as back - up means the @entity61 will be able to lend up to € 500 billion when it is fully operational			0
the € 200 billion earmarked for the @entity99 will come from @entity3 's national central banks			0
it will likely come from the banks ' reserve funds , although the details are not yet agreed			0
what sanctions can be imposed on countries that breach the deal ? the deal says there will be " automatic consequences " including possible sanctions if member states exceed a 3 % deficit ceiling --- in other words , greatly spend beyond their means			2
there will be graduated financial sanctions for those countries which consistently breach the ceiling			2
what are the consequences for the financial markets ? global stocks were mixed after the deal was unveiled and analysts warn only time will tell if it can work			0
the plan could supply short term stability but previous experience on euro crisis measures shows relief can be brief			0
@entity133 , of @entity134 , says its success may depend on whether markets believe @entity3 's politicians will stick to tighter financial supervision			1
has everyone agreed to the deal ? no. talks have been fraught and the resulting deal threatens to become one of the most divisive issues the 27 - nation @entity146 has ever faced			1
some @entity146 nations have balked at ceding further powers to @entity146 authorities and have threatened to walk away			0
some say this will result in a two - tier @entity146			2
so who is in and who is out ? all 17 eurozone nations and six other @entity146 states outside the euro area have signed up			2
initially , four countries cast doubt on the deal , complaining that it sweeps away some of the away hard - fought foundations of the @entity146			1
@entity163 's prime minister @entity162 told @entity1 that he had no mandate for treaty change			0
but , alongside @entity166 and the @entity167 , he said his country would leave the door open			0
this leaves @entity14 , under prime minister @entity171 , alone among the 27 @entity146 nations to point - blank refuse to sign			1
@entity171 said the treaty failed to safeguard @entity14 's voice in crucial policy decisions over the @entity3 single market and financial services sector			1
he said he had effectively vetoed an original deal , forcing @entity181 chancellor @entity180 and @entity183 president @entity182 to forge ahead with a treaty that will be subservient to @entity146 regulations			2
@entity16 has decided to hold a referendum on the fiscal pact because under the @entity16 constitution the people have to vote to ratify any significant transfer of sovereignty to @entity3			1
it is likely to take at least three months to organize the referendum			2
the @entity16 have twice rejected @entity146 treaties , only to approve them in second referendums			1
@entity196 for the @entity146 as we know it ? the treaty has exposed deep divisions between @entity146 members -- chiefly @entity14 and the rest of the bloc			1
this sets the stage for a series of legal challenges as @entity14 strives to ensure the treaty does not result in a wholesale restructuring of the @entity146			1
with @entity14 forcing the treaty to operate outside @entity146 mechanisms , there could be an appetite among the rest of @entity3 to cold shoulder the @entity14 and concentrate resources within their new club			1
that said , @entity14 's prior refusal to join the euro and pervading " euro scepticism " could just mean the new treaty reinforces the status quo , albeit with frostier relations			0
so will this solve the crisis ? the new treaty was not due to be finalized until march this year -- after which it will have to be ratified by all participating countries			0
the @entity16 vote will likely delay this process			0
even aside from the potential spanners in the works presented by @entity14 , @entity166 , @entity163 and the @entity167 , grim prospects for the euro and @entity146 still lurk on the horizon			1
ideally , everyone will stick to the new rules , and those countries that require emergency bailouts will be granted them , allowing the @entity146 to slowly put its debt problems behind it			1
the danger is that with politically - unpopular austerity measures biting deep , the new stricter controls on government borrowing will become unworkable			0
this could lead to an evaporation of investor confidence , the collapse of debt - exposed banks , an emptying of government coffers , a nosedive by share markets , and bleak prospects for the euro .			0

" fiscal compact " lays out tighter financial rules for eurozone countries
deal also strengthens mechanisms to safeguard financial stability and bailouts
@entity14 has walked away from deal , raising prospect of @entity146 in - fighting
@entity16 has decided to hold a referendum on the fiscal pact which could take months to organize
