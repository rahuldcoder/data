-- would you stay in a country whose neighbor was hurling threats warning of an imminent " moment of explosion " ? it 's a question many expats , business travelers and tourists currently in @entity12 are pondering , as tensions simmer in the region			1
while @entity12 remains one of the world 's most ethnically homogenous nations , approximately 2 % of the population comes from foreign shores -- many of them students or @entity22 teachers			1
( some @entity12 media reports estimate as many as 22,000 teachers of @entity22 as a second language are in the country			1
) recent events have left many unnerved , but also pragmatic , and looking to their @entity12 colleagues and friends for advice			1
@entity32 teacher @entity31 , originally from @entity33 , has worked in @entity34 , @entity12 , at a boys ' high school for the past two years			1
despite global unease over spiraling tensions on the peninsula , he says he and his colleagues remain largely unmoved by recent events			0
" reactions are non-existent at the moment , " he said			0
" my co-teachers and i have never discussed it and it never comes up among @entity46 in general conversation			1
" timeline : @entity46 's threats and bluster however , he acknowledges that a moment of nervousness did lead him to take some precautions			1
" i was ( slightly ) scared the other day when i thought i heard air raid sirens going off on my way home from school , " he said			0
" just in case , i packed a light bag , ready with my passport , some cash and a change of clothes ready to go if i need to get out of @entity65			1
" @entity12 has had almost 60 years to prepare for any future conflict with its belligerent neighbor , and the country is quick in times of tension to roll out precautionary measures			1
@entity12 ' unflappability in the face of such an existential threat has impressed many foreigners , and encouraged some at least to feel safer			1
@entity78 - @entity77 , who also teaches @entity22 in @entity12 , recently noticed that subway stations in @entity80 had been outfitted with emergency equipment display cases , including instructions on how to wear a gas mask			2
" it 's the norm , " she says			0
" i 've noticed the increase for about three weeks now , since rhetoric had really been starting to heat up from @entity46			2
i think it 's good the city is preparing just in case			0
" @entity46 : our global fear and fascination @entity32 student @entity93 says her mother back in @entity95 , @entity96 , asked her to pack a bag and be ready to leave should anything happen			1
friends of hers on the @entity102 base in the @entity104 district of @entity80 , where thousands of @entity32 troops are stationed , also told her it was best to be prepared in the event of conflict			2
it 's a bizarre contrast , @entity93 explained			0
" in @entity12 life is going on as if nothing is happening , but from the updates from my mom the worry creeps in , " she said			2
" i just hope my wonderful journey in @entity12 thus far does n't end in disaster			2
" the @entity46 's fiery rhetoric has sparked jitters in the @entity32 , with a recent @entity0 / @entity120 poll of @entity32 revealing that 41 % of those surveyed saw @entity46 as an immediate threat to the @entity32 , an all - time high			2
@entity124 @entity123 , who is currently teaching @entity22 in @entity125 , @entity12 , has found that the stoicism of her @entity12 friends and colleagues about the current situation on the @entity130 is not shared by her @entity32 family and friends			1
" they ( my family ) want me to leave because they fear , since @entity125 is very near to @entity80 , there is the possibility of a bombing occurring , " she says			0
" all the foreigners i know are somewhat worried and are considering leaving the country early			0
" @entity12 ' views @entity141 as man - child ' were the worst to happen , she says , she plans to get to the airport as soon as possible			1
" considering that @entity46 has made failed flight attempts before , i feel that if they were to send a missile toward @entity80 their calculations would be off and i may be in harm 's way if that happens , " she says			2
the pleas of her family were echoed by relatives of @entity32 tourist @entity154 , currently traveling in @entity12 visiting friends			1
he , too , has been struck by the calm atmosphere , but his family members are unnerved			0
" my wife and daughters and my mother are all saying : ' come home early , it is too dangerous there ! ' " he says			0
" but i say there is nothing to worry about and i am sincere about that			0
" why tensions have erupted so suddenly -- and why now -- is a question many in the international community are struggling to answer			0
for @entity172 teacher @entity171 , who has lived in @entity12 for almost a decade , all fingers point to the @entity46 's inexperienced new leader , @entity141			1
" i feel that he is having to prove himself to his military -- some of whom i 'm guessing served under his grandfather -- that he is in fact in charge and still has his grandfather 's and father 's ideologies at heart , " he says			0
in @entity186 , in the east of @entity12 , where @entity171 now lives , he says people are still very much carrying on with their lives , with no panic buying of essentials and people still focused on their day - to - day business			1
he , for one , is determined to follow their example -- for now			0
" i made a choice years ago that i would not live in fear or worry about the situations that may or may not happen in regards to @entity46 , " he said			2
" i have n't thought of leaving the country , not yet			0
" interactive : @entity46 's missile capabilities			0
