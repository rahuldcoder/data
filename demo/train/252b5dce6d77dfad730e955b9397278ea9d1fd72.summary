-- with at least 1,488 tornadoes and 547 deaths , 2011 has been one for the record books			1
although the tools forecasters use are getting better , concerns remain about whether residents have enough accurate information or are heeding warnings			1
@entity0 meteorologist @entity10 , a committee member of the @entity11 , is attending its annual meeting this week in @entity14 , @entity15 , which was battered by the april 27 tornado outbreak in the @entity17			1
that day and april 28 saw 187 tornadoes , the largest outbreak in @entity21 history			1
about 600 meteorologists , 150 of them in broadcasting , are at the conference			2
before coming to @entity0 in 1999 , @entity10 provided storm information to viewers of four @entity28 tv stations			1
she spoke tuesday about warning systems , technology and what you can do to safeguard your family			0
q. what are some of the key topics at the meeting ? @entity40 the big focus is certainly the tornado outbreak and going back over the data , looking at atmospheric conditions and comparing it to history			1
with these tornadoes ( april 27 - 28 ) there was a lot of lead time and warnings			1
we have been finding that people did n't react right away			1
a lot of the people did not take to shelters when the alarm went out			1
there is still a high false alarm rate with tornado warnings			1
experts want to know how people in storm areas receive warnings and how they react			1
q. what are some lessons from this year of high tornado activity ? @entity67 continues to get better			1
we need to improve communication			0
people need to know the difference between a watch and warning			1
you can never let your guard down			0
some local meteorologists were heroes in this situation			0
they saved lives , such as @entity80 in @entity14 ( @entity0 affiliate @entity81 )			1
they can help calmly people get through this			1
you need to watch the local meteorologist your trust			0
at a national level , we can educate viewers and readers on what is coming			0
we are there to provide that advance warning			0
what happened in @entity14 and @entity97 can happen to you			1
@entity98 how did april 27 go , from a forecasting and response perspective ? @entity40 the basic consensus is that emergency officials and warning meteorologists did everything right			0
early that morning , there was a huge squall line and it brought terrible wind damage and several tornadoes			1
there were tens of thousands of people left without power during that time			1
( @entity114 ) are worried about that loss of power and whether that prevented people getting information they needed			2
also , some people thought the early - morning storms were the main event			2
in this particular outbreak , we saw evidence of the potential for a major outbreak four to five days in advance			0
the @entity129 ( an arm of @entity131 ) will issue probabilities of severe events based on models			0
three days out for sure they were sending out public information			0
they knew the bulls - eye was in northern @entity15			0
people 's responses in taking the storm seriously were really heightened based on the tone of the local broadcast meteorologist			2
they were saying it was @entity145 , and it was			0
q. are there changes in how warnings are going out from the @entity151 ? @entity40 in addition to a tornado warning , a tornado emergency is declared when a tornado is confirmed on the ground			1
q. what about false warnings ? @entity161 tornado warning is issued when rotation is shown on doppler radar or a person or verified storm chaser has actually seen a tornado			1
how many times do they actually see a tornado out of the rotating storm ? we know it is rotating , but we do n't why some ( storms ) drop tornadoes and some do n't			1
people are complacent because there a high percentage of false rates			1
if it 's a rare event in your event in your town , you are probably less likely to that			0
warnings are issued on a county - by - county basis			2
it 's up to local officials in the county on whether they will sound the sirens			0
if a severe thunderstorm enters a county and there is a tornado watch in effect some counties will sound a siren			2
others will only sound them when there is a tornado warning			2
part of the problem is that there is not a national uniform system on what to trigger			0
maybe we need to go to a @entity209 system			0
we can now share a warning to a small part of the county , called a polygon warning			0
if they send a siren off for the whole county , it increases the perceptions of false warnings			1
i think there needs to be another type of warning issued for confirmed tornadoes			2
maybe they can pulse it , rather than blaring it			0
q. what about the forecasting equipment ? @entity40 @entity232 is changing its current doppler radars over to a dual polarimetric doppler system			2
( the additional information from vertical radio waves will greatly improve many different types of forecasts and warnings for hazardous weather , the government says			1
) this radar has a better rate of detection of weaker tornadoes			1
if you can better detect these , you can reduce false warnings some bureaus have already been changed over			1
@entity98 how has the science changed in your years as a meteorologist ? @entity252 radar revolutionized it			2
we are making more progress on the science			0
we can have all the technology in the world , but if we ca n't communicate it well , or people do n't receive it and respond , that is a problem			2
q. what else is helping with preparedness ? @entity267 media is the up and coming thing			0
more and more people are receiving their information from @entity272 , @entity273 and mobile devices			2
sometimes there is false information sent out , so you have to be careful about source information			2
but if you have signed up for an app that you trust , such information is very accurate			0
also , several of those who lost power during the tornadoes said they turned to social media to receive their information			2
q. what can an individual do ? @entity290 is the key to this			0
people need to be prepared all year round , especially for the loss of power			1
have a @entity131 radio with batteries that are fresh			0
a survey has shown very low percentage of people get information from weather radios			1
i have tried to remind viewers that it is available			0
you need to be educated on whether you are at risk , if today is going to be a tornado day			2
where is my safe place ? it is the lowest level of your home , away from windows			0
if you are outdoors , you need to know if there is a risk of storms			0
know where there is a sturdy building with a bathroom			0
where am i going to evacuate ? you need to take that responsibility .			0

@entity10 : there is still a high false alarm rate with tornado warnings
" what happened in @entity14 and @entity97 can happen to you , " @entity10 says
the weather service is changing its radar to one better detects weaker tornadoes
people need to be prepared all year round , @entity10 says
