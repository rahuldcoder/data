-- @entity2 's decision to award the @entity3 to @entity4 has stirred plenty of simmering tensions in football 's global community -- but is it about to boil over into costly demands for compensation ? on tuesday , football 's world governing body @entity2 insisted it will not be liable for compensation if the @entity3 is staged in winter rather than summer			1
@entity2 is considering rescheduling the @entity3 because of concerns over high temperatures in host nation @entity4 , where the heat can reach 122 degrees fahrenheit in the summer months			1
and @entity19 football chiefs argue that if the competition is moved then @entity2 should offer compensation to those nations affected by a major rescheduling of global football 's calendar			1
but a @entity2 spokesperson told @entity0 : " as part of the bidding documents all bidders , including the @entity30 , accepted that the final decision regarding the format and dates of the staging of the @entity35 and @entity2 though initially expected to be in june / july , remains subject to the final decision of the @entity37			0
" there is no ground for any speculations			0
" @entity2 will discuss the proposal to move the tournament to a cooler winter date at a meeting in @entity45 next month			2
on tuesday @entity46 went public over its view that explained in a statement that it wants @entity2 's @entity49 to consider : " an in - principle decision that just and fair compensation should be paid to those nations that invested many millions , and national prestige , in bidding for a summer event			1
" if there is consensus within the @entity58 that a change in date should be considered , then a transparent process should be established to examine the scheduling implications for all leagues and a method developed for agreeing appropriate compensation for those affected			0
" @entity4 beat bids from @entity46 , @entity67 , the @entity68 and @entity69 to win the right to stage the @entity3			1
@entity2 president @entity71 recently expressed fears that the heat in a @entity4 summer would have detrimental health effects on players and quality of football at the tournament			1
he said : " you can cool down the stadiums but you ca n't cool down the whole country and you ca n't simply cool down the ambiance of a @entity3			0
" @entity71 's @entity49 could make a decision on 3 october to move the @entity3			0
@entity85 , chairman of @entity46 's @entity46 , said he had written to mr @entity71 to explain why he is against a quick decision and why he feels @entity46 has a case for complaint and compensation			2
" @entity46 invested heavily in the @entity3 process and the entire nation was behind the bid , " he said			1
" since december 2010 @entity46 has been careful not to let its misgivings about the process be interpreted as sour grapes			0
" but now , with increasing speculation about a change that will impact on us as one of the bidding nations , and because our competition will be affected , we have made our position public			0
" our season takes place during the @entity19 summer to avoid a clash with other local football codes			0
" if the @entity3 were to be staged in the middle of our @entity111 season it would impact on our competition , not just for 2022 , but for the seasons leading up to and beyond that date			0
" last month @entity115 chief executive @entity114 said @entity2 should consider switching the @entity3 from @entity4 rather than staging the event in winter			1
@entity4 's @entity3 team was not immediately available for comment			2
the bid team is understood to be happy to host the tournament whenever the @entity2 requires regardless of the ramifications for others .			2
