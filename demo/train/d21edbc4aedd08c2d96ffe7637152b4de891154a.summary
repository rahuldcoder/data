-- psychologists , not to mention parents , have long observed that kids who seem depressed tend to have trouble getting along with -- and being accepted by -- their peers			1
what the experts have n't been able to agree on is which comes first , the depression or the social difficulty			2
most researchers have supposed that kids who are excluded or bullied become depressed as a result ( rather than vice versa ) , while others have suggested that the two problems go hand in hand and are all but impossible to tease apart			2
a new study , published this week in the journal " @entity21 , " provides some of the strongest evidence to date for a third theory : kids who cry easily , express negative emotions , and show other signs of depression ultimately suffer socially because they are shunned by their peers and attract the attention of bullies			1
" bullies target youth who are unlikely to fight back , " says lead author @entity30 , @entity31 , an assistant research professor at @entity32 , in @entity33			1
" youth who are depressed really have the potential to appear vulnerable , and are easy marks for victimization , unfortunately			0
" @entity0 : 10 things to say ( and not say ) to someone with depression to better understand how depression and social problems unfold over time , @entity30 and her colleagues tracked an ethically and socioeconomically diverse group of 486 children as they went through the 4th , 5th , and 6th grades			1
along the way , the researchers periodically gauged depression symptoms and social acceptance by surveying parents , teachers , and the kids themselves			1
fourth graders who showed signs of depression were more likely than their classmates to be victimized as fifth graders , and kids who were picked on in fifth grade tended to be less accepted by their peers in sixth grade			1
by contrast , the researchers found little evidence that being bullied increased a child 's risk of becoming depressed in later grades			0
@entity0 : @entity73 's depression may rub off on kids although the findings suggest that depression tends to precede social difficulty , they do n't rule out the possibility that problems with peers can make an already depressed child even more depressed			1
" i think it 's very possible it is a cyclical process , " @entity30 says			1
it 's not clear from the study what the depressed kids might have done , specifically , to turn off their peers			1
but research in adults suggests that depression can have a negative effect on a person 's social skills and overall agreeableness , says @entity96 , @entity31 , an associate professor of psychology and education at the @entity99 , in @entity100 , who did not participate in the study			1
depressed people " are often characterized by negativity and inappropriate self - disclosure -- think of ' @entity103 ' on ' @entity104 , ' " @entity96 says			0
" as a result , they may not be all that much fun to be around			0
unfortunately , they sometimes get into a cycle where depression brings social skills deficits , and social skills problems lead to interpersonal rejection , which helps maintain the depression			1
" @entity0 : how you can help someone who 's depressed @entity30 and her colleagues suspect that a similar pattern may occur in children			2
" one possibility is that depressed youth maybe exhibit social skill deficits or behaviors ... or excessively talk about their problems , " she says			0
" these are all things that have the potential to be irritating to peers			0
" @entity131 , @entity31 , a developmental psychologist at @entity133 's @entity132 , in @entity134 , @entity135 , says the study was " rigorous and well - conducted " and that the findings make sense			2
" even from a pretty early age , [ expressions ] of sadness or ... other negative emotions can lead to problems with peers , " she says			0
" if parents and teachers are able to work with kids to express their emotions in different ways , then they may not elicit the same maltreatment from peers			2
" @entity131 emphasizes , however , that depressed behavior never justifies the bullying or exclusion of a child			0
" i think it 's important to avoid a ' blame the victim ' perspective on this , " she says			0
the findings , @entity30 says , drive home how important it is for parents and teachers to be aware of the signs of depression in children , arrange for treatment if needed , and help depressed children socialize and get along with their peers			1
the cycle of depression and victimization is likely to get worse if left unchecked , since depressive symptoms tend to intensify during the teen years , she says			0
parents who are concerned that their child might be having a hard time socially can volunteer in his or her school to get a better sense of what 's going on , @entity131 says			2
and they can encourage friendships by organizing playdates , she adds			0
" even just having one good friend can really be a buffer against victimization -- or depression , for that matter , " she says			0
" if kids are able to establish one solid friendship , that can be a real protective factor for them			0

study : kids who cry easily and show other signs of depression ultimately suffer socially
" bullies target youth who are unlikely to fight back , " says lead author @entity30
the findings , @entity30 says , drive home how important it is for parents to be aware
