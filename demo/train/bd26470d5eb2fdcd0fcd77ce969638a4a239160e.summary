@entity2 @entity1 leaders were forced on thursday to delay rolling out their bill to raise the nation 's debt limit , after conservatives complained the package failed to include deep enough budget cuts and significant changes to entitlement programs			1
@entity11 signals @entity13 focus now on debt ceiling the setback comes as speaker @entity11 prepares to wrestle with his conference over how to ultimately handle short term spending and the prospect of a government shutdown beginning on tuesday , if @entity20 does not act to refill federal coffers			1
@entity11 and his top lieutenants initially hoped to move ahead with their proposal to permit @entity24 to borrow more money to pay its bills while waiting for the @entity27 to vote on a plan -- called a continuing resolution -- to keep the government funded through mid-november			1
the debt package includes a lengthy list of @entity13 priorities , including a one year delay of @entity35 , provisions to roll back regulations on businesses , tax reforms , and approval of the @entity42 oil pipeline			1
but the added items have not garnered enough support from @entity2 republicans			0
" it definitely has a lot of goodies in it			0
things that arguably would grow the economy and would arguably would generate more revenue , " @entity49 told reporters , saying he was undecided on how he would vote on the plan			0
but he added that the issue of government spending overall must be considered			0
" @entity24 has a spending problem and this debt ceiling bill does not address the problem , " @entity58 said			1
rep. @entity62 of @entity63 told @entity64 that she was also undecided but wanted to see deeper budget cuts on the measure			0
" i came here to cut spending and to reduce the size of the federal government so when those opportunities arise i want to take advantage of them , " @entity62 said			0
some @entity2 @entity1 questioned the strategy of skipping ahead to the debt ceiling fight before @entity20 resolved the question on spending and the possible shutdown			1
they argued the @entity13 still had some leverage to force a change to @entity35 on that measure			1
" i think we need to focus on the @entity83 first			0
i think it 's important that we complete that before we move onto the debt ceiling , " @entity85 @entity1 @entity84 said outside the @entity2 floor			0
the draft plan @entity13 leaders had been working on was really a collection of bills previously approved by the @entity1 - controlled @entity2			2
leaders learned from the last bruising fight in 2011 over the debt limit that a bloc of conservatives would resist any legislation to authorize new borrowing by the @entity101 , so they decided to attach sweeteners			1
@entity105 @entity1 rep @entity103 complained the @entity13 plan fell short of @entity11 's pledge to demand an equal amount of spending cuts for the amount of the increase in new borrowing authority			1
he also said it contained " very little " in the way of changes to entitlement programs like @entity117 for the elderly and poor			0
when asked early on thursday about the scope of cuts , @entity11 told reporters that " in this bill , we have spending cuts and we have issues that will help spur more economic growth			1
we think the balance is correct			0
" @entity2 @entity1 leaders likely will need to modify the package			0
they need a unified conference because @entity2 @entity131 wo n't vote for it , insisting the @entity2 should pass an extension of the debt limit without any conditions			1
" @entity2 is attaching the @entity1 platform to the debt ceiling			0
in a week full of absurdities , this takes the cake , " sen. @entity139 , @entity141 - @entity140 , said in a written statement			0
at an event in @entity147 on thursday , president @entity145 reiterated that he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling			0
as @entity11 works to corral his own members on the debt limit vote he also needs to beat the clock to avoid a government shutdown			1
@entity131 are scheduled to vote friday on the @entity2 @entity13 passed spending bill and are expected to strip out the provision that defunds @entity35			1
@entity11 indicated on thursday that @entity2 @entity1 will modify that bill and kick it back to the @entity27 as the clock ticks down toward the deadline			2
the speaker dodged questions on what specifically @entity2 @entity13 would tack on , but he downplayed that this move - with so little time remaining - would increase the chances of a possible shutdown			2
" we have no interest is seeing a government shutdown , but we 've got to address the spending problems that we have in this town and so there will be options available to us			2
there 's not going to be any speculation about what we 're going to do or not do until the @entity27 passes their bill , " @entity11 told reporters on @entity171			2
@entity13 aides and members have told @entity64 that there are no final decisions , but the @entity2 could add a one year delay of the @entity35 requirement that all individuals enroll in health care coverage			1
the administration already allowed a one year delay for corporations to provide coverage			0
another possible option , one most @entity13 aides believe could be used , is to add a provision that repeals a tax imposed on medical device manufacturers that helps pay for part of the costs of the new health care law			2
on thursday , senate majority leader @entity196 called the medical device tax a " stupid tax , " but told reporters he does n't want to deal with it as part of the stopgap spending bill			1
later , a @entity196 spokesman clarified that the @entity205 @entity204 was referring not to the tax itself , but to the idea of attaching that provision to the spending bill , saying the @entity2 should pass a " clean " spending measure			2
another option under consideration is adding a provision to the spending bill that repeals federal support for health care premiums that the government covers for members of @entity20 and their aides			1
under the @entity35 , which is set to take effect in the states on tuesday , members and their aides would obtain coverage under the new health care exchanges and the government , as their employer , would cover a major portion of that premium			0
@entity229 @entity228 rep. @entity228 told reporters he could support a so - called " clean " spending bill that continues funding , but warned " if there 's going to be a relaunch it should be something that the @entity27 will accept before october 1st			2
" @entity11 pushed back on the notion that continued back and forth over the measure only increases the chances of a shutdown			2
though he said , " i do not expect that to happen			0
