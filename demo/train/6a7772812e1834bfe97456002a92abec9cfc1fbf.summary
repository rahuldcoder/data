thanks to @entity11 's july 2014 cover story on @entity12 ( read it here in its entirety ) we now know the plot will revolve around our favorite male exotic dancers going to a strippers ' convention			1
according to @entity11 , that 's the first memory of his stripper days @entity12 shared with his producing partner @entity22 when pitching the first film : " i want to do the story of when i 'm in a dark u-haul with a bunch of these guys and we 're doing drugs driving up to the stripper convention			1
" @entity5 director @entity31 told them the idea was n't a scene in the movie -- it was a movie in itself			2
so the sequel will now be inspired by two conventions @entity12 attended when he was 19			1
" the women would come from miles and miles around , " @entity12 says , recalling one audience numbering 3,000			1
" then you lock the doors and you say all bets are off			2
it gets zany and crazy , and it 's a wild ride			1
it 's an incubator for insanity			1
it does n't matter almost what you do onstage			0
i do n't want to put anything in black and white on a page , but if you 've been to one , you know how crazy it gets , and now pour kerosene on that			0
you 've seen ' @entity5 ' -- now multiply that			0
it 's just exponentially crazier			1
i thought it was absolutely insane			0
" the article also reveals that while @entity31 's producing partner @entity62 will direct the " on - the - road adventure , " the retired director will still be the director of photography and camera operator , as well as the film editor			1
" i want to be a part of it			0
i want to be in the band , but i just do n't want to be the frontman this time , " @entity31 says			0
@entity0 : ' @entity71 ' set to take it off in theaters july 2015 @entity73 thought : imagine 3,000 extras			0
they should encourage women to bring their own singles and whatever money the cast earns goes to a charity of @entity12 's choice			1
@entity82 thought : this plot seems to remedy the three tiny complaints about the first film — that we did n't get to know the other strippers well ( looking at you , @entity89 * * k @entity90 and whatever @entity93 's character was named ) , that there was n't enough dancing , and that @entity12 's love interest was wooden ( presumably all significant others stay at home )			1
below are other fun tidbits from the @entity11 cover story , which again , is worth reading in its entirety : there 's a reason @entity12 ( or @entity107 , to his mother ) was believable in " she 's the man : " " soccer was the first sport that my parents put me in , and ultimately all the parents kind of came over to my mom and were , ' we think @entity12 would be better at football ...			1
we love him , he 's really great , but he 's kind of hurting our children			1
' i was just a little wild			0
" you 've seen him reenact the " @entity122 " lift with his dog			0
well , he can probably do the pottery wheel scene , too : in what is my favorite @entity11 cover story interview location since @entity127 took a writer to an @entity129 , @entity12 suggested that he and his crutches - bound profiler go to the paint - your - own - pottery store @entity131 because he got into sculpting when he was filming " @entity135 " in @entity134 and has " always wanted to paint my own bowls and dishes and s -- t. " ( if you 're dying to know what @entity12 painted , jump to the final page of the piece			1
) you 're going to hear a lot about his claim that he 's a " high - functioning alcoholic " : i 've already received an email from one addiction specialist who is " available for comment			1
" perhaps it 's a " cry for help , " as that person suggests , but if you read the quote in context , you could argue it 's hyperbolic			1
@entity0 : @entity154 has to return for ' @entity5 ' sequel he likes to sculpt at night , with a bottle of wine or a glass of bourbon			0
" i probably drink too much , you know , " he says			0
" my wife , that 's what she bought into ...			1
i 'm probably a pretty high - functioning , i guess , you know , i would say , alcoholic , i guess			1
" he likes how it slows down his mind			0
" there 's probably a tendency to escape			2
i equate it to creativity , and i definitely equate it to having a good time			0
" still , he says , nothing makes you cut back like having a baby , and he 'll not drink for four months when they make the @entity5 sequel			0
" then , at the end of that movie , " he says , " it 's go time			2
" on a lighter note , he and your 5 - year - old niece have something in common : " i just love cake , " he explains			2
" @entity186 cake , to be specific			0
it has little colored candies inside the cake , and then you get the confetti icing , which is really hard to find sometimes ...			0
it 's really hard to explain to people , because it 's not icing with sprinkles on top			2
it 's icing that actually has candies inside of it			2
it 's @entity200 icing ...			2
the icing , coupled with the actual confetti cake			0
it 's a beautiful mix. it is an angel sent from heaven			2
" you 'll be left wondering what bet @entity12 and @entity206 have made about how much " @entity209 " will earn its opening weekend : @entity206 has yet to pay up on their bet for the first film 's : " i will kiss your tip ! i will kiss the tip of your d — through your underwear if we make $ 35 million			1
