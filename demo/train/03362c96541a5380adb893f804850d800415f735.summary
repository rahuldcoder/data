-- on monday , @entity1 delivered what his campaign billed as a major foreign policy address , in which he sought to distinguish himself from the man he called the " lead from behind " president			1
the speech at the @entity10 , which largely focused on the @entity11 , served as something of a warm - up for the two remaining debates between @entity1 and @entity15 to be held later this month , one of which will focus entirely on foreign policy , while the other will deal with both domestic and national security issues			1
in the forthcoming debates @entity1 will have the tricky job of trying to position himself as tougher on national security than @entity15 -- who tripled the number of @entity26 troops in @entity27 during his presidency and ordered the raid that killed @entity30			1
@entity15 has also authorized six times as many drone attacks as @entity33 did in @entity34 against suspected members of @entity36 and the @entity37			2
the attacks during the @entity15 administration have killed at least 1,400 people , almost double the number of prisoners that were transferred to the @entity44 prison camp by the @entity33 administration			2
@entity15 is also the first @entity26 president to authorize the assassination of a @entity26 citizen , @entity48 , who played an operational role in @entity36 's @entity51 affiliate and was killed by a @entity26 drone strike in @entity51 last year			1
indeed , @entity15 has vastly escalated the @entity26 covert war in @entity51 , using @entity55 drones and @entity56 , such as @entity57			2
criticism of @entity15 's national security policies is growing on the left about the overall legality of @entity55 drone strikes and , in particular , the @entity48 killing			1
fact check : @entity1 's comparison of past , present @entity65 pointless given those facts , how then do you run to the right of @entity15 on national security ? well , you might say that you are planning to go to war with @entity71 because of its advancing nuclear program			1
or you might say that you will institute an @entity26 no - fly zone over @entity74 without a @entity76 authorization for such a measure			0
or that you will keep @entity26 combat troops in @entity27 well past the withdrawal date of 2014 announced by the @entity15 administration			2
the problem with such policy choices is that the @entity26 public has little appetite for more wars in the @entity87 world			0
no such policies were mentioned in @entity1 's speech on monday , nor will they likely feature in his future debates with the president			1
on monday @entity1 did say , regarding @entity74 , that his administration would " identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat @entity100 's tanks , helicopters , and fighter jets , " a policy that is more aggressive than providing " nonlethal " help , such as communications equipment , which the @entity15 administration is already giving to @entity74 opposition forces			1
but even this supposed distinction from @entity15 was less than meets the eye , as @entity1 did not directly say that his administration would arm the @entity74 rebels			2
and close @entity26 allies @entity112 and @entity114 are already providing weapons to them			0
if the @entity26 were to start arming the rebels directly , identifying exactly which parts of the @entity74 opposition should get arms might be difficult , because the opposition is a tangled mess of many factions that even includes elements of @entity36			0
fact check : was @entity15 ' silent ' on @entity71 2009 protests ? according to @entity127 , a @entity11 expert at the @entity128 , there are more than 800 militias now operating in @entity74 , making it a complex task to sort out the ones that are both militarily viable and more aligned with @entity26 interests			0
in his monday speech , @entity1 advanced the sensible idea that the $ 1.5 billion in yearly @entity26 aid to @entity136 should be conditioned on its building up its democratic institutions and maintaining its peace treaty with @entity140			1
but other than this good idea , @entity1 offered few specific policies to distinguish himself from what the @entity15 administration is already doing in the greater @entity11			1
@entity1 explained that he would prevent @entity71 from acquiring nuclear weapons capability and would not hesitate to put more sanctions on @entity71			0
but this is basically the position of the @entity15 administration , which has said it will not allow @entity71 to have nuclear weapons and has imposed such onerous sanctions on the country that the @entity71 currency has plunged in value as much as 80 % against the dollar since the beginning of the year			0
on @entity27 , @entity1 said he will work to transition from @entity26 combat troops to @entity27 security forces by the end of 2014 , which is -- the @entity15 administration 's policy			1
@entity1 said he would not make a " politically timed retreat " from @entity27 , a somewhat mystifying construction , since this year @entity15 negotiated a well - publicized @entity160 with the @entity27 government that will keep an as - yet - unspecified number of @entity26 troops in @entity27 in an advisory and counterterrorism role until 2024			2
that is something that @entity1 did n't mention in his monday speech and hardly suggests a precipitous @entity15 - led retreat from @entity27 , which is already @entity26 's longest war			1
famously , @entity1 did n't mention that longest war in his acceptance speech at the @entity175 convention in august , so his new embrace of the @entity177 seems a tad belated			2
@entity1 's monday speech underlined the fact that there is more agreement than disagreement between mainstream @entity184 and mainstream @entity175 on foreign policy issues			1
fact check : did @entity15 say he wants ' daylight ' between @entity26 , @entity140 ? to create the illusion that there are genuine substantive policy differences , @entity1 enlisted the issue of trade , saying on monday that he would " champion free trade			1
... the president has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years			0
" there have been serious critiques of @entity15 for not being more active in negotiating new trade deals , but to claim that he has n't signed any in the past four years is demonstrably false			0
in fact , the @entity15 administration signed trade deals with @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 last year , which a headline on @entity206 termed the " biggest since @entity207			0
" when stories on @entity210 undercut your claims as a @entity175 contender for president , you have a problem			0
@entity1 was also grasping at straws when he said on monday that " the size of our @entity65 is at levels not seen since 1916			0
" that is n't really true even in the trivial , numerical sense -- but more importantly , the @entity65 in 1916 did not consist of nuclear - powered aircraft carriers and submarines with enough nuclear weapons to wipe out life on much of the planet			0
the @entity26 today has 11 aircraft carriers , while the @entity227 have recently built their first one , which wo n't actually be able to handle aircraft operations for years into the future			0
and the overall idea that the @entity26 is falling behind militarily is nonsensical			0
the @entity26 spent more on defense in 2011 than the countries with the next 13 highest defense budgets combined			0
fact check : has @entity15 ' not signed one new free - trade agreement ' ? if monday 's speech is a preview of how @entity1 will handle the foreign policy debates with @entity15 , the president will be on much firmer ground than he was with his uncertain performance during the first debate , which focused exclusively on domestic issues .			1

@entity246 : @entity1 sought to draw clear line between his and @entity15 's foreign policy
he says @entity1 's problem is @entity15 set a tough line with drone war , @entity30 *mission*
@entity1 made sense on idea of tying @entity136 aid to democracy , fulfilling peace treaty , he says
