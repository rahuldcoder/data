-- would it help you manage your stress level to get a warning that the text message you 're about to read is your boss or partner chewing you out ? the creators of a new mobile app think so			1
@entity10 is an @entity11 app developed by a student at @entity14 's @entity13			1
it color - codes incoming messages on @entity18 , @entity19 and via text , using their choice of language to predict their tone			1
@entity24 means positive , blue is neutral and red is a warning of potential nastiness			2
masters student @entity29 said she created the app so people know whether to expect to feel better or worse after checking in			1
" the ultimate objective of this application is to make the user aware of the negative contents they receive so they are able to manage their stress in the best possible way , " @entity32 , a senior lecturer at the university , added in a news release			2
" for example , if most of what is received from social media websites by a user on a particular day was negative , it is important that the user attempts to take an action in order to not get stressed , especially if this may affect the individual 's performance at work and / or their behavior at home			1
" on a sample image provided by the school , a tweet from a sender saying he had a great time the night before showed up in green , as did a text wishing the recipient a happy weekend			0
two @entity19 posts with links to news stories ( a movie review and a political story ) earned neutral blue			2
another one announcing that the next day 's weather will be bad ( " hope you brought a jacket " ) and one saying that the sender is tired and had taken the wrong bus were flagged in red			0
( no word on whether the app can detect irony or sarcasm			0
) @entity29 and @entity32 plan to present the app at a september conference in @entity84			1
it is still in the testing phase and not yet available			0
they said they plan to release it for free in the @entity90			0
if there is enough interest , they then hope to make a version for @entity96 mobile devices .			0
