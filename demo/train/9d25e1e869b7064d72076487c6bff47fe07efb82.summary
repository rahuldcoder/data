@entity0 -- the mother of one of the two @entity5 men arrested last week at a @entity0 airport allegedly on their way to fight with an @entity9 - affiliated group in @entity10 says the two men are guilty of stupidity -- but not of the sinister plan described by authorities			1
" anything makes him angry			2
but he 's not a terrorist ; he 's a stupid kid , " @entity17 said of her @entity19 - born son , @entity18			1
@entity22 , 20 , of @entity23 , @entity5 , and @entity22 , 24 , of @entity24 , @entity5 , are charged with one count each of conspiracy to kill , maim and murder persons outside of the @entity19 , which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison			1
the men , who were taken into custody at @entity33 on june 5 , intended to take separate flights to @entity35 on their way to @entity10 " to join designated foreign terrorist organization @entity37 and wage violent jihad , " according to federal prosecutors			1
the criminal complaint filed in @entity41 in @entity42 alleges that in 2007 , @entity17 and @entity43 traveled together to @entity44 , where they intended to enter @entity46 to commit violence against @entity19 troops there			1
@entity17 told @entity1 that her son went to 16 or 17 psychiatrists for what she called " anger management issues " that surfaced when he was a boy			2
he lived at his parents well - kept home , where his angry outbursts were common			2
however , she said , he was n't particularly religious			0
if he was devout , he would make his prayers on time			0
he did n't , " she said			0
she helped him pack for his trip to @entity35 , though she said she resisted the idea from the start			1
@entity17 said she was reassured by a man named " @entity62 , " who had befriended her son and @entity22			1
" he said we 're gon na study @entity66			0
i said but here there are many schools			0
but he say in @entity35 , they 're better , " she recalled being told by the man when she expressed concerns about @entity17 moving to @entity35			1
" do n't worry , i take care of them , " she said @entity62 told her days before her son and @entity22 were arrested boarding a flight to @entity35			1
she said she believes the man was an undercover federal agent who recorded her son making incendiary comments against the @entity19 and continued to build the case against him and @entity22			1
" since i saw him , i warned my son and @entity22 , " @entity17 said			1
" but my son say ' always you say about my friends they are undercover			2
' " the @entity17 family invited @entity1 on saturday also talk to a woman who said she was set to marry @entity22 upon his arrival in @entity35			1
@entity17 said she met her son 's girlfriend the night before			1
the 19 - year - old woman , who said her name is @entity89 , sat at the family 's home , cloaked in a niqab , a veil that covers the entire body and face with only a sheer cloth revealing the eyes			2
she said she met @entity22 in an online chat room			1
@entity89 showed @entity1 her passport stamped june 9 , 2010 , indicating her arrival at @entity33 from @entity101 , @entity102			0
she also produced her airline itinerary , which shows that her trip started in @entity105 -- where , she says , she was waiting for @entity22			1
" we were supposed to get married and study awhile in @entity35			1
that was the plan , " @entity89 told @entity1			0
she said she moved from @entity109 , where she was born to @entity35 parents , to @entity105 at @entity17 's behest a few months ago			1
when he did n't arrive in @entity105 on june 6 , she was shocked to learn from a friend in @entity0 that her soon - to - be fiance had been arrested			2
" she told me that @entity22 got arrested for terrorism and that they were saying he was going to @entity10 , " @entity89 said in disbelief			1
" so i did n't know what to do ; words ca n't explain what i felt			0
i was in shock and i could n't stop crying			0
" she said she boarded a flight and arrived in @entity0 a day before @entity17 's arraignment thursday			2
it was then that she saw him for the first time , through a veil in a federal courtroom			0
" i did n't have any ticket booked or anything			0
i just went to the airport and i booked a ticket from there , and i left , " @entity89 said			0
@entity1 recently learned that @entity17 and @entity22 were followers of an extreme @entity135 group based in @entity0			1
@entity1 obtained an image of the two suspects attending a protest in @entity0 organized by the @entity139 on june 1			0
they appear to have been taking part in a demonstration against @entity142			0
one is holding a banner , the other an @entity139 poster that includes the slogan , " exterminate the @entity147			0
" the society 's video of the event , posted on its @entity152 channel , has since been removed			2
the rally took place a week before the two men made their way to @entity33 airport and were arrested			0
" my soul can not rest till i shed blood			0
i wan na like be the world 's [ best ] known terrorist , " @entity17 is alleged to have told an undercover agent in the @entity19 last year			1
later he said , " we 'll start doing killing here , if i ca n't do it over there			0
" another image -- from late 2008 -- shows @entity22 at a different rally , holding a poster that says " death to all juice " ( sic )			2
it 's not clear whether that rally was organized by the @entity139			2
when asked about the rallies @entity17 attended , @entity89 insisted his presence was a show of outrage -- not intent			0
" but that does n't make him a terrorist			2
that only shows how much he dislikes what the people are doing to the @entity186 , " she said			0
" that does n't show he was going to @entity10 and do anything			0
