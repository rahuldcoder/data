-- @entity3 life and business coach @entity1 has learned to live with less , and love it			1
before launching her own coaching and motivational speaking business last year , @entity5 had a " day job " in academic fundraising and lived in affluent @entity9 , a neighborhood adjacent to president @entity11 's @entity3 home			1
pricey dinners out with friends did n't give her much pause			1
but those days are over			1
she first downsized her apartment , moving to a smaller place in a less expensive and less trendy ' hood , saving $ 300			1
even though she 's now back in @entity9 , she 's got a six - month sublet arrangement that keeps her rent low and keeps her mobile			1
she subscribes to utility companies ' budget plans so she 's no longer surprised by fluctuating bills			1
she totes sales flyers when shopping the supermarket , eats more seasonally and cooks at home more			1
her athletic club membership ? it 's history			2
said @entity5 : " i went out to the ( nearby @entity3 ) lakefront , and that was my gym			1
" that $ 150 - a - month cell phone bill ? gone			2
it may not be sexy , but a $ 55 prepaid phone has taken its place			2
when first launching @entity44 , she " decided to take contract or part - time assignments that would allow me to build my business while generating another income to cover my living expenses			2
i could never have come to this place without living simply and not listening to the ' shoulds			2
' " " people do n't know what they actually need			2
a need is electricity ; a want is cable			2
" because she does most of her coaching work with entrepreneurs and professionals remotely with clients across the country , she 's not tied to one physical location			2
@entity5 's real goal is to spend @entity3 's colder months elsewhere -- with her mom in @entity63 , visiting a younger sibling in her native @entity65 -- and downsizing her expenses will give her the freedom to do it			1
it 's all about choice			2
the ongoing global recession and the accompanying hit to our pockets , bank accounts and retirement funds , not to mention environmental and ecological concerns , have prompted many folks to reconsider what 's important			2
and to some , it is n't what they own or what they can buy			2
instead , it 's about " voluntary downscaling " or learning to live joyfully with less " stuff			1
" " we bought into the media notion that money buys happiness			2
we really , really tried that for a couple of generations , and it did n't work , " said @entity90 , author of " @entity91 : toward a way of life that is outwardly simple , @entity98			1
" @entity99 is a former social scientist who also holds an mba and has been preaching the sustainable - living gospel since the 1970s			2
the concept of " voluntary simplicity , " coined by social philosopher and @entity114 follower @entity113 back in the 1930s , " reframes the conversation into a way of life filled with greater conviction , creativity and it is n't just about living with less , but living with balance			1
" for some , like @entity5 , whose previous work kept her spinning madly on the 50 - to - 70 - hour workweek treadmill , it 's about purposefully changing careers in order to do something they love , despite the financial downgrade			0
for others , it might mean selling their cars and relying instead on their feet , public transportation and car - sharing services such as @entity131 in @entity3 and @entity132 in @entity133 to get around			1
" about half of our members tell us they 're choosing to sell a car or not buy a car because of @entity135 , " said @entity135 chairman and ceo @entity134 , whose car - sharing network serves 250 college campuses and more than 50 cities in @entity140 , and stretches across the @entity141 to the @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
" they also tell us they save on average $ 600 a month , " which he said is roughly the equivalent of getting a $ 10,000 raise after taxes			0
in many cases , it 's @entity157 , or those born after 1980 , leading the way			0
a recent @entity135 - commissioned study ( two - thirds of so - called " @entity162 " are under 35 ) found 55 percent of those surveyed have actively made an effort to drive less			1
while more than half cited " protecting the environment " as one key reason , a whopping 78 percent who are licensed drivers say car ownership is tough because of high gas prices , parking and maintenance costs			1
the financial savings are huge , but @entity134 said " the real longterm and more emotional connection is around the whole concept of ' less is more			0
' " spending on experiences vs. things @entity180 is the @entity181 - based author of " the @entity182 , a @entity183 : how to @entity184 , organize , and @entity185 " whose blog moniker is " @entity188			1
" now in her late 30s , she 's been happily living with less for 12 years , thanks to a travel - inspired revelation			0
" i always packed as lightly as possible , and found it exhilarating to get by with just a small carry - on bag , " said @entity192			0
" i thought , wow , if it feels this great to travel lightly , how amazing would it be to live this way ? i wanted to have that same feeling of freedom in my everyday life , so i decided to get rid of all my excess possessions and live with just the essentials			1
i wanted to spend my time and energy on experiences , rather than things			0
" a 2009 move -- before which @entity192 and her husband sold their house , most of their possessions and relocated to @entity211 for a stint with only one duffel bag each -- offered another clean slate			0
" we lived a rather nomadic life for three years , owning only what we could carry in our bags , " she said			1
" we recently had a baby and are a little more settled now , but still committed to living with as little as possible			0
although i did n't embrace minimalism for financial reasons , becoming a minimalist is the best thing i 've ever done for my bottom line			0
" @entity192 's three major lifestyle changes include buying less ( " it 's amazing how much money you save simply by staying out of the stores " ) , decluttering regularly and seeking out versatile items , from dress - ' em - up - or - down ballet flats to multi-purpose cookwear			0
" i think of minimalism as living with just enough stuff to meet your needs , and nothing in excess			0
" the ' luxury ' of choice but does simplicity ever feel like a sacrifice ? " oh my goodness , i never think of minimalism as deprivation , " said @entity192			0
" rather , it 's eliminating the excess -- unused items , unnecessary purchases , unfulfilling tasks -- from your life			1
well , i may have fewer possessions , but i have more space			0
i may have fewer commitments , but i have more time			0
@entity261 is making room for what matters most			0
" granted , this is about voluntary downscaling , which by its very definition suggests that those making such choices have the luxury to do so			0
@entity135 's car - sharing customers , said @entity134 , are better - educated and earn more on average than their similarly aged peers counterparts			0
" it 's not that they ca n't afford ( owning a car ) ; they 've learned to do the math , " he said			0
" they 've learned you can have a simpler life and one that 's more sustainable by living with less			1
" the real questions , said author @entity90 , are : " ' what do you care about ? what do you value ? ' it 's important for people to realize it is n't simply the amount of stuff we consume			1
it 's about our families , our work , our connection with the larger world , our spiritual dimension			0
it 's about how we touch the whole world			0
it 's a way of life			1
" and downscalers like @entity302 have n't looked back			1
" the only thing i regret is i did n't understand this eight years ago , " she said			0
when she shares her living - happily - with-less philosophy , " i hear people say , ' i wish i could do that			0
' you can ; you just need to start asking yourself different questions			0
you have to understand wants vs. needs and start setting yourself up to pursue these things			0
