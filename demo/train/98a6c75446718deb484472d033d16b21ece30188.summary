-- @entity1 will testify against the couple that allegedly held her captive in an elaborate compound hidden in their backyard for 18 years if there is a trial , a lawyer for her family said at a news conference thursday			1
this photo of @entity1 was taken at the 1991 @entity15 parade			2
she was abducted later that year			0
attorney @entity17 admitted it has been a difficult transition for @entity19 and her two children -- who police say were fathered by her captor -- given her captivity spanned more than half her life and was the only world she knew for so long			2
" but there is no question that she knows that terrible and wrong things were done to her and that those people must be held accountable , " @entity26 said			1
@entity26 said he had no idea when a trial would be set for @entity34 and @entity1 , who have both pleaded not guilty to charges relating to @entity19 's alleged kidnapping and subsequent abuse			1
he acknowledged @entity19 would have to relive the " trauma " in court by sharing the " very , very sordid tale			2
" @entity26 also said that because of @entity1 's previous criminal history , which includes a kidnapping and rape charge for which he was registered as a sex offender , @entity43 would automatically receive a sentence of 25 years to life if he were found guilty on only one felony charge			1
but @entity26 said the family is trying not to focus on any of that and instead work on building a new life together			0
he said he had met with @entity19 and her family twice for a couple of hours and was happy to see " how well they had been doing			1
" " even more encouraging was the second time i met with them , i saw progress , " he said			0
" i 'm just very pleasantly surprised watching the dynamics , and i think it 's a very positive thing going forward			0
" @entity26 said @entity19 's daughters , who police said never went to school or a doctor , were receiving tutoring			1
@entity19 has been participating and observing			2
" this is a woman whose [ own ] formal education ended in the fifth grade , " he said			0
" she has a brain that she wants to develop , so it 's a very positive thing			0
" the family received medical attention and counseling beginning the day @entity19 and her children were discovered , @entity26 said			1
he also said they had received donations of more than $ 100,000 from the public , which would help the girls as they get older			1
he praised law enforcement and family members for helping protect @entity19 and her children after her discovery			1
" [ they are ] very guarded in allowing the girls access to tv news , @entity87 , etc. , " he said			0
" because they 're being a mother , a grandmother , protecting the girls from too much information too early			0
" he said he knows there is a curiosity about where the family is , but pleaded that the public and the media give the family time to heal			2
more than anything , @entity26 said , @entity19 's family is working to make life as normal as possible and allow them to make up for lost time			1
" to watch the interaction between @entity105 and her mother ... after 18 years is remarkable , " @entity26 said			0
" the emotions there , i think they 're still wrestling with all of that but i think they 're making great progress			0
