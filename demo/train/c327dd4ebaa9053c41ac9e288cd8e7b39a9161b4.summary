@entity0 -- @entity2 , a young man previously unknown to the general public , has become the first @entity5 official known to resign in protest over the @entity8 war			1
he was the senior @entity5 civilian adviser in @entity9 , @entity8			1
there certainly have been more famous resignations over a president 's war policy			2
president @entity15 's first secretary of health , education and welfare and the architect of much of the civil rights and @entity21 programs , @entity22 , resigned because he could not support the war in @entity24 and privately told the president he could not support him for re-election			1
@entity15 's deputy secretary of defense @entity27 resigned after becoming convinced the war in @entity24 , which he had strongly supported initially , was unwinnable			1
after his resignation he unsuccessfully urged @entity15 not to bomb @entity24			0
@entity27 later resigned as president @entity30 's secretary of state after arguing again unsuccessfully against " @entity31 , " the disastrous desert rescue attempt of our 52 hostages in @entity35 that cost the lives of eight @entity5 soldiers			1
our history is filled with brave men and women who have resigned because they could not support a policy or an administration , but it 's never easy to quit and far more people carry on quietly and do what they perceive as their duty			1
many thought former secretary of state @entity46 should have resigned rather than testify before the @entity47 on @entity49 's supposed weapons of mass destruction , information he may have thought was suspect			2
there might not have been an @entity49 war if he had done that			2
but the resignation of @entity2 , a former @entity58 captain and @entity49 veteran from the @entity60 , as reported tuesday on the front page of the @entity62 may have more impact than the others			1
his comments reflect the feelings of many of his countrymen who have far less knowledge of the @entity8 situation then he does			0
the @entity71 and @entity72 made every effort to keep @entity2 from leaving and valued his service			1
he was exactly the kind of person we needed there if our @entity8 efforts are to be successful			0
even though i support the continued efforts in @entity8 and believe the president should give gen. @entity84 what he needs , @entity2 's words reflect thoughts that i , too , have pondered			1
@entity2 said in his resignation letter : " i have lost understanding of and confidence in the strategic purposes of the @entity5 ' presence in @entity8			1
i have doubts and reservations about our current strategy and planned future strategy , but my resignation is based not upon how we are pursuing this war , but why and to what end			2
" but before the president acts ( and he will make his decision quickly , i hope ) he needs to answer @entity2 's : " why and to what end ? " if he ca n't , he will have great difficulty convincing his party and the nation of the need for further action			1
the why part is easier to answer			0
the @entity5 and our @entity110 allies went into @entity8 after the ruling @entity113 government refused to turn over @entity114 and to stop @entity115 from operating with its protection			1
the @entity5 has been in full pursuit of @entity114 since the august 7 , 1998 , truck bombings of the @entity5 embassies in @entity121 and in @entity122 in which hundreds were killed			2
these attacks were preceded by the 1993 bombing of the @entity126 and the @entity127 in @entity128 that killed 19 @entity5 servicemen			2
after that came the attack on the @entity134 in @entity135 , which preceded the september 11 , 2001 , attacks against the @entity126 and the @entity131			0
thousands of our fellow citizens were murdered and our way of life was altered forever			0
in spite of being on the @entity142 's most wanted list , @entity114 has been an elusive target			0
in the late ' 90s on several occasions he was in our sights , but the inability or hesitancy to pull the trigger allowed him to escape			0
he is still out there with tens of thousands of supporters who want to destroy @entity5 and @entity154			2
the threat is still real			0
the bad guys are still out there and may be here			0
i feel this is the most important decision this president will make -- and other world leaders will judge him on his decision			0
is he a viable partner ? can he make the tough decisions @entity5 presidents need to make ? many @entity5 have doubts as they almost always do with any activity of our troops beyond our borders			1
we as a nation are still badly scarred from the divisions in the country caused four decades ago by the @entity175			0
our president never served in the military , and it might be important to review the thinking of some who have and some who went before him			0
@entity181 was a young infantry captain in @entity182 who went on to be one of the most important secretaries of defense and who rebuilt our broken military after @entity24			0
facing a demoralized military officer corps and troops who were n't in much better shape , @entity181 asked all the major leaders in the @entity131 who had been young officers in @entity24 what lessons they learned			2
included was a former young major in @entity24 who was now a brigadier general and served as @entity181 's military assistant , @entity46			0
@entity181 came up with the @entity197 doctrine : 1			0
the @entity5 should not commit forces to combat unless the vital national interests of the @entity5 or its allies are involved			1
@entity5 troops should only be committed wholeheartedly and with the clear intention of winning			1
otherwise , troops should not be committed			2
@entity5 combat troops should be committed only with clearly defined political and military objectives and with the capacity to accomplish those objectives			1
the relationship between the objectives and the size and composition of the forces committed should be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary			2
@entity5 troops should not be committed to battle without a " reasonable assurance " of the support of @entity5 public opinion and @entity217			1
the commitment of @entity5 troops should be considered only as a last resort			1
a version of this became the @entity46 doctrine			0
every president should have a copy of @entity181 's doctrine on his desk			0
number 2 and 5 are still the unanswered questions			0
they are the biggest obstacles to whatever decision president @entity230 makes			0
that , along with @entity2 's question : " to what end ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity237 : @entity2 quit the @entity60 *due* to doubt about war
he says @entity2 is latest in *tradition* of @entity5 who resigned over wars
presidents must ask tough questions before sending troops , @entity237 says
@entity237 : troops should only be committed to serve vital @entity5 interests
