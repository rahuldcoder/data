-- until recently , fears of peak oil and dependence on @entity5 suppliers were the key factors shaping our energy policy , pushing governments to scramble for fossil fuel alternatives			2
then came shale gas , tar sands , and other unconventional sources			0
industry found ways to affordably extract fuel for decades to come			2
so many are now imagining an end to the energy crisis			1
that 's a dangerous mistake			0
first , even the most optimistic predictions leave our grandchildren exposed to an uncertain future			0
more immediately -- and maybe more importantly -- burning fossil fuels is the number one cause of global warming and its catastrophic consequences			0
we need to innovate alternative energy sources now more than ever ... and our choices are limited			1
there are few viable options that will preserve the levels of prosperity that modern industrial economies have come to expect			1
solar , advanced nuclear fission , and fusion offer the best hope but , unfortunately , none are ready for large - scale deployment			2
all need time - consuming innovations so we can not afford to hesitate ; research must be ramped up across the board and government must keep up the pace			2
of our three most promising technologies , fusion would be the biggest prize			2
it is in many respects the perfect energy source			1
sea water provides millions of years of fusion fuel			2
fusion reactions are safe , they emit neither radioactive waste nor greenhouse gasses and fusion reactors would take up relatively little space			2
the catch is fusion is very hard to do			0
two isotopes of hydrogen ( deuterium and tritium ) must be held at 200 - million degrees until they collide and fuse to make helium			0
it is not easy to build a device that runs at ten times the temperature of the @entity70 , but it is possible			0
in fact , the @entity73 experimental facility , @entity74 -- hosted in the @entity75 , has already done it			0
for a couple of seconds , it generated 16 megawatts of fusion power -- enough to supply around 8,000 homes			1
this is an astonishing achievement			0
we must now extend that duration and power and innovate technologies to make fusion electricity at a price that the consumer will pay			1
we 're working flat out on the first of those goals			0
seven international partners representing more than half the world 's people are constructing the critical experiment right now in @entity96			1
called @entity97 -- it is designed to reach a self - sustaining fusion burn -- the last scientific hurdle to fusion power			1
construction will complete in 2020 with a fusion burn expected by 2030			1
there are other approaches to fusion -- for example the laser experiments at the @entity108 in @entity109 -- but for many of us in the scientific trenches , the fusion burn on @entity97 is expected to be the defining moment			1
but what about our second objective of economic viability ? @entity97 is n't meant to achieve that goal			1
in addition to clearing our last remaining scientific hurdle , we need to advance a parallel engineering agenda into key reactor technologies that will enable commercial fusion power plants to reliably deliver electricity in a highly competitive market			1
this means technological advances in areas such as structural and functional materials , power conversion , and reliability			0
@entity133 and @entity134 are on the job but the @entity136 and @entity73 are reluctant to face the engineering issues			0
certainly , cost increases on @entity97 have n't helped			1
if we continue to starve the technological research agenda of funds , however , we risk delaying fusion power and ceding technological leadership to @entity133 and @entity134			1
it goes without saying that resources are limited in our recession - ravaged economies ... but disinvesting in seed corn is obviously self - defeating			0
what can we afford ? the world energy market is approximately € 5 - € 10 trillion ( $ 6.5 - 13 trillion ) a year			0
the total world spend on energy research is about 0.5 % of this -- strikingly low			2
fusion research including @entity97 construction is less than € 1.5 billion ( $ 2 billion ) a year -- not even 0.05 % of the market			1
we are , it seems , not taking the threat of climate change and energy shortages seriously			0
in this context , the roughly € 200 - 500 million ( $ 260 - 650 million ) per year needed to vigorously pursue the parallel track of technology innovation in fusion seems absurdly small			0
we often hear that @entity164 ' dire predictions about population growth were wrong because humans innovated solutions to food shortages			0
will we innovate ourselves out of our long - term energy constraints too ? only if we sufficiently fund alternative energy research now			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

fusion power is , in many ways , the perfect energy source , says @entity173
few viable energy options will preserve prosperity in modern industrial countries
experiments at @entity97 in @entity96 aim to create fusion power by 2030
more alternative energy funding and research required to help solve energy crisis
