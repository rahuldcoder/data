@entity0 , @entity1 -- as one of the most successful franchises in @entity6 history , the @entity2 opened the 2011 season with a victory over the @entity9			1
the nationally televised game was nearly sold out with a seating capacity of 56,000 fans			2
the franchise with six @entity15 championships was considered a strong contender for a pennant with new manager @entity18 , who succeeded @entity19			0
since owner @entity20 acquired the team in 2004 , the @entity2 have reached the post-season four times , following a decade - long drought			1
but a vicious post-game attack on @entity9 fan @entity27 and @entity20 's bitter divorce proceeding have changed the landscape at one of baseball 's most picturesque parks			1
equally disturbing is how fan attendance has declined dramatically , with many sections of the stadium now empty on game days			1
the renowned team that nurtured icons such as @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 is unmistakably troubled , said @entity43 , executive director of the @entity44 in @entity45 at the @entity46 at @entity0			1
" here you have a team that is not only @entity50 's darling but truly one of the crown jewels of @entity6 , " @entity43 said			1
" in many ways , what has happened is that the brand luster has been tarnished			0
i would say this has been happening precipitously over the last few years			0
and not winning could n't have helped			0
what you have is a turnaround that is much needed , " @entity43 added			0
" it 's a sad state of affairs			2
" but all 's not lost , @entity43 said			2
" if you 're going to ask me whether the value of the brand is diminished significantly , i would n't say that , " @entity43 stated			0
that brand is partly founded in how the then - @entity68 broke baseball 's color line in the 1940s with the signing of @entity40 , a former @entity72 star who eventually became the first @entity73 elected to the @entity74			1
the team debuted in @entity76 in 1890 as the " @entity77 " and won the @entity79 championship -- the first of 21 pennants that the club would win during the following 100 years			2
" @entity89 " was later attached to the team because of the maze of trolley cars in the @entity86 borough of @entity76 , and the nickname was shortened to its current form			2
in 1955 , the @entity2 won their first @entity15 , during the @entity40 era			1
then in 1958 , the team moved to @entity0 , where it won the @entity15 again in 1959			2
in another landmark , mellifluous broadcaster @entity91 this year entered an unprecedented 62nd season announcing @entity2 baseball			1
still , the attack of @entity27 on march 31 -- the season 's opener -- has cast a pall over the team : he was beaten nearly to death in the parking lot , supposedly by two @entity2 fans , and he 's still hospitalized			1
the @entity27 assault left an indelible sense of concern over safety , in spite of increased security , according to interviews with fans and season ticket holders			0
police have yet to solve the case			0
in a recently filed lawsuit , @entity27 's family alleges that security officers and managers at @entity118 have been apprised of a history of aggressive , violent behavior			2
the suit asserts the presence of criminal gang activity in some crowds at the stadium and inadequate safety -- both factors in the attack , according to the lawsuit			0
while overall league attendance is down this season , the @entity2 are taking an especially hard hit : there are 7,000 fewer fans attending home games -- amounting to an attendance loss of 200,000 so far this year , @entity2 officials say			1
in addition , @entity20 's financial turmoil led @entity6 commissioner @entity139 to take over day - to - day operations as the league conducts an investigation into his finances			1
@entity20 declined to be interviewed			0
the nation 's struggling economic recovery and the team 's below - .500 winning percentage may have played a role in attendance declines			1
" it 's a number of factors , " @entity150 , @entity2 's vice president of communications , said in explaining the loss of the faithful			1
@entity155 , who has been attending @entity2 games for 31 years , says he feels disenchanted			1
" since the @entity158 took over he 's made it his priority to take care of personal business besides making this organization the successful organization it 's always been , " he said			2
@entity155 said the feeling of a family atmosphere has dissipated , and he blames @entity20			0
" people have lost trust			0
you used to come here , and it would n't matter if the team was winning			0
it just does n't feel that way anymore , and i think in essence people are boycotting until something turns around , " he said			0
if a @entity180 judge overseeing the divorce of @entity20 and @entity182 orders that the @entity2 be put up for sale , @entity0 councilwoman @entity178 is prepared : she has already introduced legislation calling on @entity6 to give fans an opportunity to buy the team			1
" watching the ongoing custody trial over the team has been painful for all @entity2 fans			1
the truth is that this team belongs to the fans ; and we should have a chance at purchasing the @entity2 if they are sold , " said @entity190 , who added that her late father , supervisor @entity190 , was responsible for bringing the team to @entity0 in the 1950s			1
her proposal is a long shot			0
in 1961 , @entity6 passed a resolution forbidding public ownership of teams			1
congressional legislation is needed to remove the restriction and make it possible for fans to join together to purchase the team , said @entity190			0
meanwhile , a consortium of investors led by @entity211 - based real estate developer @entity210 has launched an effort to purchase the @entity2 similar to the way the @entity215 's @entity214 became a publicly owned franchise			1
@entity217 is a season ticket holder who says he also feels betrayed by the lavish personal spending of @entity20			0
but he remains a die - hard fan			0
" i am bitter over what he 's done over the years , but it 's not going to stop me from supporting the team			2
there could be 12 people here and i would still come out every night , " @entity217 said			0
@entity217 , who attended opening day with his 15 - year - old son , has some concerns about safety , especially how the @entity233 attack has damaged the image of fans			2
" people have labeled us as like some fans being gang bangers that come here and get kind of rowdy , which i have seen , but this is a family game			0
i personally feel safe , but security does what it can to make sure it 's safe , " @entity217 said			0
@entity217 wants to see the team go from loser to winner			0
" we need an owner here who 's committed to the team , the fans and most importantly winning			2
it 's been ( almost ) 25 years since we 've won a @entity15 , " said the @entity2 fan .			1

@entity2 attendance is way down this year
