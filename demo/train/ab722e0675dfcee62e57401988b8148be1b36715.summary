-- the first ever video footage of a giant squid swimming in the ocean depths is " an enormous breakthrough , " according to a prominent marine conservationist who wrote a book about the quest to find the mysterious creatures			1
" people have been searching for them for hundreds of years , literally , " said @entity9 , the author of " @entity10 for the @entity11 : the @entity14 and @entity16 's @entity15			0
" scientists and television broadcasters released images this week of the 10 - foot - long giant squid they had filmed deep in the @entity21 , far off the coast of the @entity24 mainland , during hundreds of hours of underwater research			1
the discovery is significant for both science and mythology , in which giant squids have long played a notable role , @entity9 said in an interview on @entity0			1
" we 're going to learn how this thing moves , " he said			0
" how it swims , what it does with its arms when it swims			0
" he described the squid as having eight arms and " two very , very long tentacles which it uses to grasp its prey			1
" its limbs have suckers lined with sharp teeth			0
monsters reminiscent of giant squids have been featured in fables and imagery through the ages , like the @entity51 in @entity53 legend and the @entity54 in @entity56 mythology			1
" for a long time , people did n't even think they existed , " @entity9 said			1
the carcasses of dead giant squid that washed ashore eventually proved that the creatures were real , but finding live ones in the wild has proved extremely challenging			1
the first still photographs of one of the huge creatures were captured in 2004 , and footage was taken of one floating on the surface of the water in 2006			2
but researchers and cameramen had never before managed to catch a glimpse of them in the ocean abyss where they live			0
the mission that finally tracked down the creature involved 55 dives in two special submersible vehicles that spent a total of more than 285 hours far beneath the waves			0
some of the dives went deeper than 3,000 feet			0
the team of scientists and filmmakers on the mission came from a variety of institutions , including the @entity86 of @entity24 , the @entity87 and the @entity24 broadcaster @entity88			0
they used equipment including " ultra-sensitive camera systems with light invisible to squid , bio luminescent lures and secret squid attractants , " the @entity87 said			2
@entity88 and the @entity87 say they plan to air their programs about the squid sighting this month .			2
