-- for @entity2 , nothing said summer more than spending a day at @entity3			0
back in its prime , the @entity5 , @entity6 , theme park drew families with novelty rides , carnival food and live entertainment			1
@entity2 , now 25 , says he visited @entity3 at least twice each summer when he was a kid in the 1990s			0
after moving back to his hometown earlier this year , @entity2 wanted to revisit his childhood amusement park			2
the theme park , which had been operating for 55 years , closed in 2004			1
what @entity2 found instead was a heap of scraps from a forgotten place			0
with a camera in hand , the web designer walked carefully through the tall fields of grass that now surround much of the abandoned remnants of the theme park			1
within the confines of @entity3 , @entity2 was hit with a rush of memories from his youth			0
" my older brother and i would beg my parents to take us , " @entity2 said			0
" when we got there , we would ride the same three rides over and over again			0
" those deep feelings of nostalgia associated with places like local , homegrown theme parks are quite common , according to @entity39 , a historian with the @entity40			1
" in this internet era , people are looking for something different to do , and a lot of amusement parks are able to capitalize on that , " he said			2
attendance at @entity48 theme parks increased by 59 million visitors from 2000 to 2013 , said @entity50 , a spokesman for the @entity51			1
the jump in attendance is positive news for an industry that historically goes through cycles of park closures			2
from 2004 to 2008 , amusement parks hit a slump with dozens of theme parks shutting their doors nationwide			1
this includes several smaller theme parks that closed in the mid- 2000s , including some that had survived a century , @entity39 said			1
@entity66 's @entity65 and @entity68 's @entity67 , were examples of this trend , @entity39 wrote in a 2006 article for @entity72			0
those smaller theme park closures have left a void for some intrepid travelers who are looking for a more nostalgic amusement park experience			1
our fascination with abandoned buildings @entity80 is one of those travelers who is always searching for a vintage or " @entity83 " place to explore			2
it 's what brought her and her family to the gates of @entity88 , a relic theme park , sitting all alone on top of @entity90 in @entity91			1
@entity92 stumbled onto the theme park while doing an online search for interesting places to visit with her family			1
there was n't much information she could find on @entity88 , except that it once operated in the 1970s before closing its doors			1
what she did find online were photos of a real - life version of " @entity105 " its yellow bricks , steel gate and lush green trees sparked her curiosity			0
she and her family visited the park in late may and found that the gates to the theme park were open , so they stepped inside			1
@entity92 , her husband and daughter walked carefully down the yellow brick road			0
the path was still brightly colored after all these years , with a few bricks missing here and there			0
" i do n't think you are supposed to walk in the way we did , " she said			0
" the gates are there , there were the yellow bricks , and the shell of what used to be a castle			0
@entity132 was also there , and the trees looked like they were looking at you			0
" @entity88 may seem like an abandoned theme park , but it 's actually not			1
the amusement park is closed , and the space has been converted into vacation rental property			1
visitors can rent out @entity142 's house , which looks like an antique cottage , for two nights or more			2
other parts of the park can also be rented for small events			2
the theme park has n't been operational since the 1980s , when it first shut down			1
but the space went through a revival in the 1990s , according to @entity151 , the property manager of @entity88 and self - appointed " @entity152 " libraries are dying ? think again " you get the grounds to yourself , and you can stroll the yellow brick road , " @entity151 said			2
" we have been doing vacation rentals for the last 20 years			0
" spending the night in @entity142 's home and waking up on top of a picturesque mountain is an experience that keeps the park 's rental calendar pretty much booked up , @entity151 said			2
even those who are n't hardcore fans of the classic @entity168 movie enjoy spending time at the converted theme park			1
" we are n't crazy about ' @entity105 , ' but i definitely had some nostalgia walking through , " @entity80 said			2
" i had a lot of childhood memories of watching that movie with my sister when we were little , and being able to pass that experience down to my daughter			0
it makes you want to be a kid again			0
" @entity2 says going to @entity3 with his parents always felt like a treat , giving him a " special feeling that is hard to recreate or describe once you have grown up			0
" although @entity2 does n't have children yet , he hopes to share that same feeling with his own kids in the future			0
he plans on taking them to a theme park similar to @entity3			1
" there is something about local amusement parks , " he said			0
" when you go to @entity194 , i do n't think you have the same emotional connection to that park like a smaller theme park gives you			1

during the mid- 2000s , several smaller @entity48 theme parks closed their doors for good
