@entity0 -- @entity4 troops based in @entity5 have not been put on a heightened state of alert in the wake of that country 's announcement that @entity10 was behind the sinking of one of its warships in march , the @entity2 said thursday			1
at a @entity2 press briefing , @entity4 defense secretary @entity14 said the @entity4 supports the findings of the investigation -- that the ship was sunk by a @entity10 torpedo -- but he would not say what the @entity4 is prepared to do , if anything , militarily			2
" we are in close consultations with the @entity5 , " @entity14 said			1
" the attack was against one of their ships and , naturally , they will have the lead in laying out the path forward and we will be consulting with them very closely as we move ahead			0
" @entity33 chairman adm. @entity32 said the status of the 28,500 @entity4 troops in @entity5 has not changed because of the findings			1
" they are on their normal state of readiness			1
they are engaged very routinely out there , " @entity32 said			0
" we have a considerable number of forces stationed both on the land and sea and the forces are clearly aware of what 's going on , " he said			0
though @entity14 and @entity32 would not speculate on what the next step would be for @entity5 , the @entity4 is bound by treaty to assist that nation if it goes to war			1
the @entity53 is stretched thin in two wars in @entity55 and @entity56 , but @entity14 said there are other options in the case of armed conflict on the @entity61			2
" we have said for a long time that if there were a problem in @entity10 our main arms would be the @entity65 and the @entity66 , and those are not stretched in the same way that the ground forces are , " he said			0
earlier thursday , @entity70 press secretary @entity69 said the @entity4 was " in consultation with a host of different entities , including the [ @entity75 ] @entity74 ... and we 're working closely with the @entity5			1
" " i think there 's a lot of things on the table " in terms of possible responses , he added			0
@entity69 refused to comment on any specific response			0
meanwhile , the @entity83 said the @entity4 will send a clear signal to @entity10 that the sinking of the warship was in violation of international norms and it must pay a price			1
" provocative actions will not be tolerated and ... there will be consequences for those , " assistant secretary of state @entity90 told reporters			2
" at the same time , we will continue to try to see what can be done ... to continue to work towards a peaceful and stable @entity61 and the broader region , " he said			0
@entity90 said the @entity4 has a " range of tools available " to respond to the incident both unilaterally and collectively with other countries , including unilateral financial sanctions and other measures			1
however , he said , @entity0 will be guided by the actions the @entity5 government wants to take			2
asked whether the @entity4 would consider putting @entity10 back on the @entity83 's list of state sponsors of terrorism , @entity90 said it was unclear whether the ship incident would be considered an act of terrorism to meet the legal threshold for such a designation			1
the @entity117 administration took @entity10 off the list in 2008 as part of negotiations on ending @entity122 's nuclear program			0
" this is not something that anyone would do lightly , and there is an evidentiary standard here that has to be applied , " @entity90 said			0
" @entity129 normally involves ... acts of violence against innocent civilians			0
you know , at one level this was a torpedo fired by one military vessel at another military vessel			0
" senior @entity83 officials said that although the department 's lawyers would make the final determination , the attack is not likely to be considered a terrorist attack because @entity145 are technically at war			1
they pointed to a statement issued by the @entity70 calling the attack an " act of aggression " and " a violation of the @entity152			0
" that 1953 agreement inaugurated an uneasy truce between the two @entity155 , but no peace treaty has been signed to end the war			2
additionally , the officials suggested that putting @entity10 back on the terrorism list could be counterproductive because the @entity4 was not the target of the attack .			1
