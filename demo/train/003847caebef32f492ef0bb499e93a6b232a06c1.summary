-- convicted pedophile @entity1 could get his pension back , if @entity4 's pension board agrees with a recommendation to resume the almost $ 5,000 - per - month checks that he used to get			1
a state arbitrator made the recommendation friday after @entity1 appealed a ruling that he lost the right to his pension -- from working as an assistant football coach at @entity11 -- when he was convicted in 2012 of sexually assaulting 10 young boys			1
the arbitrator 's recommendation will probably go before the state board in the fall			1
both sides will first have a chance to respond to the recommendation			0
the arbitrator wrote in his opinion that @entity4 law did not allow for someone to lose a pension for @entity1 's crimes until 2004 , long after @entity1 's 1999 retirement from the university			1
before 2004 , people could lose their state pensions only if they 'd been convicted of financial crimes			0
since @entity1 was retired when the change was made , his lawyer appealed the ruling to stop his pension checks			2
it has no legal bearing that @entity1 was convicted of molesting several of the boys while he was employed by @entity11 , and on the campus where he worked			0
the recommendation has outraged some close to the case			0
" he should n't be receiving any benefits , especially benefits related to @entity11 , " said @entity43 , an advocate who has been working with @entity1 's victims			2
" i think it 's absolutely outrageous that he 's entitled to any benefits associated with the place where he offended upon so many young men			0
" attorney @entity53 , who has represented several of @entity1 's victims , called on lawmakers to change the law and make it retroactive			2
" i 'm disgusted by the fact that he 's going to continue to be paid by some form of taxpayers ' money , " @entity53 said			0
a jury found @entity1 guilty of 45 counts of child sex abuse in june 2012 , in a case in which the crimes were committed from the early 1990s through late 2009 .			1
