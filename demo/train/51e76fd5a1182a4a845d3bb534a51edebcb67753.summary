@entity22 had been licensed since march 1 , 2010 , with state authorities to run the residential day care center , @entity21 spokeswoman @entity20 said			2

the arrest affidavit , dated sunday , claims that @entity22 " unlawfully and recklessly " caused " serious bodily injury " to at least one of the victims thursday , after she left that child and six others unsupervised in the home day care and drove off in her car			1
the blaze itself likely originated on an electric stove inside , which was on and had a pot on it containing oil , according to @entity46 arson investigator @entity45			1
a definitive cause for the fire will be announced once the investigation is complete			0
neighbors @entity51 and @entity53 told investigators that they heard @entity22 screaming soon after she pulled into her driveway and went to the front door , the arrest affidavit said			1
no other adults or day care employees were at the facility , the men said			0
the two told reporters that @entity22 's car was full of groceries when she returned to the house , adding that they called 911 and tried to help get the children out as smoke seeped from the building			1
" i came to the side of the house in the backyard and smashed one of the windows open , and i could see a kid having his hands out , " @entity53 told reporters			0
" i tried to grab him , but the smoke got into my face and my mouth and i could n't breathe or see anything , and so i had to pull back , " @entity51 added that he crawled into the house in an attempt to rescue the children			2
" i ca n't see anything , it 's hot and i 'm coughing and ca n't breathe and all i hear are kids left and right saying , ' help me , help me ! ' " he recalled			2
there were seven small children , between 15 months and 3 years of age , inside @entity94 's @entity93 when firefighters came minutes later			0
@entity15 said @entity22 will be charged with at least one count of reckless injury to a child involving serious bodily injury			1
if convicted on that one count alone , she would face two to 10 years in prison			0
@entity102 , whose 19 - month - old daughter @entity103 died in the fire , described @entity22 as a " very good lady " who " loves kids			1
" he told @entity109 's @entity108 that he never had problems with the day care , calling the incident " unfortunate			2
" still , for all his positive thoughts about @entity22 prior to this incident , @entity102 said he could n't defend her actions last week			0
" she had options to call people , " he said of the day care owner 's decision to leave the children unattended			2
" even it is one child , not several children , that was a really bad decision			1
and it cost four lives			0
" @entity0 's @entity129 and @entity109 's @entity130 contributed to this report			0
