-- @entity2 team boss @entity1 believes @entity3 can show improvement when the @entity6 circuit moves to @entity7 next week			1
the seven - time world champion has struggled to challenge for a podium place in three races since returning to motorsport 's elite class , and has been outperformed by young teammate @entity13			1
but @entity1 , whose team won the world title last year after a scintillating start to the campaign , believes that the 41 - year - old @entity3 has suffered from problems not within his control			1
while @entity13 claimed third place in @entity21 , @entity3 was forced to retire with a wheel nut problem			1
" achieving our first podium of the season with @entity13 was very rewarding in @entity21 at the home race of our title partner @entity28 and a timely boost for the team , " @entity1 told @entity6 's official web site			1
" @entity3 also had a strong weekend and is getting more up to speed with every race , although circumstances beyond his control limited his race performance in @entity34 and @entity35			2
" we hope to continue these signs of improvement in @entity7 and it would be particularly good for @entity3 to be able to have a clean race and show the progress that he has made since the start of the season			1
" i am very pleased with the performance of our drivers			0
we 've achieved a reasonable set of results which are in line with the car 's current pace , but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that we are not quick enough to compete right at the front at the moment			0
this is obviously not a situation that we are happy with and we are working as hard as possible to close the gap			0
" @entity3 is 10th in the drivers ' standings after finishing sixth and 10th in the first two races , while fellow @entity58 @entity13 is fifth -- four points behind overall leader @entity60 of @entity61			1
" the enthusiasm for @entity63 and the support of the fans is very big in @entity7 so we have an attractive race ahead of us in @entity67 next weekend , @entity3 said			2
" i am confident that the fans will not leave the race disappointed			0
we looked quite reasonable in @entity21 at the last race and maybe things will play into our hands again in @entity67			2
i am looking forward to the race and fully enjoying the competition again			0
" admittedly the last two races have not been very fortunate for me , but i am very much aware of the reasons for it			0
i know how things go in @entity6 and if you look into the detail of the two races , i think everything is still going according to plan			0
you can only improve step by step , and i am confident that we are achieving this			0
