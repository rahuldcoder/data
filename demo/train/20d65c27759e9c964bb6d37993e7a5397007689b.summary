-- recently , a young @entity2 girl — just 15 years old — approached a group of police officers and blew herself up			1
the attack failed ; she claimed no lives but her own			0
@entity7 may have launched bloodier attacks , but i struggle to imagine a more heinous terror plot			2
that girl was just one of four @entity2 women to weaponize themselves this july in the populous northern city of @entity14			1
the second attempt , targeting a shopping mall , likewise killed just the bomber			0
the third slaughtered three women lined up to buy oil for their cook - stoves			2
the fourth cut short the lives of six young people at @entity25			0
these attacks cast in sharp relief a trend that needs greater attention : the real and growing participation of women in extremist movements			1
we take for granted that young girls do n't strap on suicide vests , and yet they sometimes do			2
women and girls have scant rights under the medieval control of the @entity40 , or @entity40			2
our instincts say they would never join in its abusive rule over other women , and yet they have			2
we 're used to thinking that men have a monopoly on violent extremism -- except they do n't			0
we need a better understanding of what drives women to take part in , and even give their lives for , violent movements that insist on their inferiority			1
we ca n't counter radical narratives if we do n't understand the motives of the radicalized			0
the @entity59 's @entity58 recently highlighted the surprising efforts of the @entity61 of @entity40			2
wandering the streets of @entity64 , they wave firearms and enforce the jihadist code of conduct -- and they do it all while fully veiled , because the brigade is entirely female			2
that grim vision of women 's participation challenges our less - than - nuanced understanding of radical movements			1
why do women contribute to groups like @entity7 and @entity40 that demand their submission ? sometimes , no doubt , they are coerced into compliance ; sometimes , women participate in these extreme ideologies with enthusiasm			0
i wonder if some do n't strap on a bomb as a merciful escape from miserable circumstances			0
but the important point is that we do n't really know why women join terror groups that would deny them equality and opportunity			0
we also do n't understand the full extent of women 's involvement			1
we do n't know if @entity7 's female bombers were a fluke or the first of many			1
we do n't know if the @entity61 is a one - off experiment or a model for future @entity40 governance			0
we have seen , though , that jihadists use women to exploit incomplete understandings of terrorism			1
women pass unsuspected where men do n't ; that makes them valuable fighters			0
we ca n't thwart every attack while watching just half the pieces on the board			0
though women 's involvement in terror seems to be on the rise , the tactic is old			1
@entity120 's 1966 film " @entity121 " lingered on the image of female militants applying @entity125 cosmetics — equal parts war paint and camouflage — while preparing to bomb @entity125 milk bars in support of @entity131 's independence struggle			1
@entity134 's @entity133 insurgency made extensive use of female suicide bombers ; between 1987 and 2008 , women were better represented among their @entity139 suicide commandos than they now are in either house of the @entity141			1
today , social media is rife with female supporters of @entity40 -- some of them @entity145 citizens who have traveled to @entity146 to wed and support jihadists			0
it 's time to wake up to the growing role of women			1
terror groups clearly believe that jihad is a women 's issue			1
the recruitment of women and girls is an important element of the modern threat landscape			0
in the pursuit of women 's equality at home and abroad , we still struggle to complete what former secretary of state @entity163 referred to as " the great unfinished business of the 21st century			1
" if the @entity167 is to offer a narrative of opportunity to the world — and strategically it must — then that narrative must include women and girls			0
terror groups will run out of female fighters when girls are protected from domineering violence , sex trafficking and child marriage , and given every opportunity to pursue a better path			0
some critics of @entity182 's tenure at the @entity183 have belittled her focus on women and girls -- as if the fate of half the world 's population were n't an important subject for @entity167 foreign policy			2
that indifference ca n't last			0
increasingly , radicalism has a female face			1
security issues are women 's issues ; women 's issues , sure enough , are security issues .			1

@entity202 : a series of attacks in @entity2 by female suicide bombers is *alarming*
@entity207 : increasingly , radicalism has a female face
she asks : what drives women to take part in terrorism and extremist movements ?
@entity207 : security issues are more and more intertwined with women 's issues
