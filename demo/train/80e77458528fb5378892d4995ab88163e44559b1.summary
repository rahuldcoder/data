@entity0 -- airline passengers who were trapped on tarmacs " like sardines in a can " had their opportunity to air their grievances tuesday at an unofficial @entity8 hearing that shared some of the characteristics of those flights			1
the hearing was sponsored by advocates of the @entity14			1
the hearing was overbooked : the room had more participants than seats			2
the take - off was slightly delayed : the hearings started five minutes late			2
and , appropriately , it lasted more than three hours , the maximum time passenger advocates say people should be confined on the ground			2
the hearing was sponsored by advocates of the @entity14 , which would require airlines to give passengers the option of leaving a plane after it has sat on the ground for three hours			1
the proposal , which lacked adequate support in 2007 and 2008 , has gained steam this year because of several highly publicized incidents , including a nearly six - hour overnight wait involving a regional jet in @entity37 , @entity38			1
" we were not offered food			0
we were not offered water , " said @entity41 , one of 47 passengers on the @entity37 plane			0
" the toilet broke at about 3 o'clock in the morning , and it was impossible to sleep			0
either @entity47 cried , or @entity48 cried , or my foot got stepped on by somebody going to the bathroom			0
" " people have asked me , ' why did n't you do something ? ' " he said			0
" as a practical matter , you 're a little bit in shock ; you 're in survival mode			0
you 're being told every hour that you 're going to get off			2
... there was always a carrot in front of us that we think is going to get us off the plane			0
and i suggest to you that that 's why 47 people did not mutiny that evening			0
" the star witness for the passenger advocates was @entity69 , former chairman and chief executive of @entity71 , who spoke in support of the three - hour limit			1
" we can and we should solve the problem of extraordinarily long tarmac delay by imposing reasonable obligations on the airlines and other agencies that make up our aviation system , " @entity69 said			1
but he added that he favors a looser four - hour limit until 2011 to give the industry time to adjust operating procedures			1
@entity69 said the industry 's resistance to the rule is rooted in its " preoccupation with safety			0
" the industry resists any change " that is not fully understood and has not been thought through in every detail , " he said			0
he said he believes that the rule can be made without affecting safety			0
while saying that lengthy tarmac delays can have significant impacts on individuals , he said the problem is statistically small			1
in the first seven months of this year , only 776 of 3.8 million flights -- or 0.02 percent -- experienced tarmac delays of more than three hours , he said			1
sen. @entity99 , sponsor of the @entity14 , called her bill " extremely modest , " saying many passenger advocates want even tighter time limits			1
the rule would give pilots discretion to keep passengers on board longer than three hours for safety reasons , such as lightning storms , or if the pilot believed that the plane would take off shortly			2
but two hearing participants testified that a three - hour rule could worsen the situation , increasing the number of canceled flights			1
" i do n't believe the three - hour rule will actually change things very much at all , given the small number of affected flights , " said @entity118 , an associate professor at the @entity119			1
" and when it does change things , i think some passengers may be helped , and others may be harmed			0
" if one passenger insists on being released , @entity128 said , the plane would return to the terminal , possibly delaying departure for everyone else on the plane			0
@entity128 said the focus on extremely lengthy delays is also diverting attention from the more pressing problem of routine delays			1
if @entity141 fixed routine delays , it would help alleviate lengthy delays , she said			1
tuesday 's hearing was sponsored by @entity143 and the @entity144			2
and though it was held in a @entity148 office building , it was not an official @entity150 hearing			2
writers and editors for travel industry publications took the place of members of @entity141 in questioning the witnesses			0
organizers said the top airline industry organization declined to participate .			0
