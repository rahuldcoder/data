-- world no. 1 @entity1 was dumped out of the @entity3 in the second round after an inspired performance by 21 - year - old @entity6			1
the @entity7 had n't previously won a set against the six - time grand slam winner but took the match in three sets to secure the biggest scalp of his career to date			2
@entity1 , from @entity15 , received treatment on his ankle during the second set but recovered to save a match point and send the match into a decider			1
but @entity6 held his nerve to break @entity1 's serve twice in the final set and take the match 7 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 3			1
@entity25 showed little signs of rustiness as he dispatched @entity28 to move into the third round			1
the 17 - time grand slam winner and defending champion cruised past his @entity32 opponent , wrapping up a 6 - 3 6 - 3 victory in 81 minutes			1
the @entity34 was last in action in mid-march when he was knocked out of the @entity37 at @entity37 by @entity39 's @entity38			2
but despite his near two - month absence from competition , the 31 - year - old was back in the groove swiftly to set up a meeating with either @entity46 's @entity45 or @entity47 of @entity15			1
" i did n't think i played incredible , but that 's not what i was expecting myself to do here			2
but i did n't play bad , either , " @entity25 told the official @entity51 website			2
" so i 'm very happy with how things went today			0
@entity28 is a player who can cause a lot of difficulties in the game			2
he has caused me difficulties in the past			0
today that was n't the case			0
i thought i was pretty much in control			0
" @entity25 , world no. 2 , defeated @entity62 in the 2012 @entity3 final and is looking for a 22nd @entity51 world tour masters 1000 title , which would see him draw level with @entity38 's tally			1
unlike @entity25 , the world no. 3 , @entity68 's @entity67 , was made to work hard for his place in round three after overcoming @entity72 's @entity71 7 - 6 7 - 6			1
@entity67 saved five set points in the opener and came from a break down in the second set to register his 400th @entity51 victory in just over two hours			2
he will face @entity80 no. 16 seed @entity78 next			0
the 25 - year - old told a press conference : " i felt like i hit the ball very well today			0
i just did n't return so well			0
that was the only thing i would have liked to have done better			0
" " he served well and hit a lot of aces on those points , but also i was n't reading the serve			0
so even when i was getting to it i was a little bit late and missed a few too many returns			0
" apart from that , i moved very well , which i did n't do in @entity95 , so that 's a big improvement			0
" two top 10 seeds were knocked out on an eventful tuesday			0
@entity32 @entity98 , seeded nine , was beaten 7 - 6 6 - 3 by @entity100 @entity99 while @entity101 , the @entity80 no. 8 seed was defeated 7 - 5 3 - 6 6 - 4 by @entity103 , from @entity39			1

the world no. 1 was then asked about comments about her from @entity116 starlet @entity115			1
in an interview with @entity119 magazine @entity115 , who stunned @entity109 by beating her in the @entity121 quarterfinals , claimed @entity109 had n't spoken to her since that match in january			1
but @entity109 refused to criticize the 20 - year - old and told reporters : " i 'm a big @entity115 fan and always have been			2
i 've always said that i think she can be the best in the world			0
i 'll always continue to think that and always be rooting for her			0
" i really just always wish her and anyone , really , especially from @entity116 the best			0
we do n't have that many @entity116 players , so it 's always exciting to see so many young players doing so well			0
