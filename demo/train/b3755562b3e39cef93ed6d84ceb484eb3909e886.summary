president @entity0 prodded @entity1 to eliminate the @entity4 ' decades - old @entity3 embargo friday , saying that improving relations with the communist country will help open its " hermetically sealed society " -- even if changes come in " fits and starts			1
" he said he does n't expect lawmakers to strip the embargo away immediately , and that @entity1 will need time to digest a deal he struck this week to free @entity4 contractor @entity16 , trade imprisoned spies and ease @entity4 economic restrictions on @entity3 in exchange for the release of dozens of political prisoners and expanded @entity23 there			1
his comments came during a feisty year - end news conference friday , just hours before @entity0 and his family boarded @entity28 for a holiday vacation in @entity30			1
" i do n't anticipate overnight changes			2
but what i know deep in my bones is that if you 've done the same thing for 50 years and nothing 's changed , you should try something different if you want a different outcome , and this gives us an opportunity for a different outcome , because suddenly @entity3 is open to the world in ways that it has not been before , " @entity0 said			1
" the more the @entity3 people see what 's possible , the more interested they are going to be in change			1
but how societies change is country - specific			2
it 's culture - specific , " he said			0
@entity0 offered some notes of caution , saying a presidential visit @entity3 or @entity3 president @entity57 coming to the @entity4 is n't " in the cards			1
" his moves have already triggered controversy among potential @entity62 2016 presidential contenders			0
@entity64 sen. @entity63 , who accused @entity0 of giving up leverage , is sparring with @entity67 sen. @entity66 , who advocates a smaller @entity4 footprint overseas			1
@entity0 said he expects a " healthy debate " to rage in @entity1			1
" i think that ultimately we need to go ahead and pull down the embargo , which i think has been self - defeating in advancing the aims that we 're interested in , " @entity0 said			1
" but i do n't anticipate that that happens right away			0
" @entity0 sounded an optimistic tone , saying he is " energized " and " excited " about the final two years of his presidency even after democrats in @entity1 were shellacked in november 's midterm election			1
" my presidency is entering the fourth quarter , " @entity0 said			1
" interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter			0
and i am looking forward to it			0
" the president immediately made headlines by saying @entity86 " made a mistake " canceling a movie after @entity89 's hack			1
he also drew attention for calling on female journalists for all eight of the questions he took -- which @entity94 press secretary @entity93 said was intentional			0
" the fact is , there are many women from a variety of news organizations who day - in and day - out do the hard work of covering the @entity103 , " @entity93 said			1
" as the questioner list started to come together , we realized that we had a unique opportunity to highlight that fact at the president 's closely watched , end of the year news conference			1
" @entity0 touched on the clashes that are guaranteed to come once @entity62 take full control of @entity1 in january , setting up showdowns over @entity0 's signature health care law , the @entity114 that conservatives would like to green - light , financial regulations and more			1
he identified international trade and tax reform as areas he might be able to find common ground with the @entity62 - led @entity94 and @entity122 , and said staff - level conversations will take place between @entity0 's @entity94 and @entity62 congressional leadership between now and the jan. 20 @entity126 address about individual and corporate tax reform			1
@entity0 said he 'll issue proposals of his own to overhaul the corporate tax structure			1
" then there are other companies that are paying zero because they 've got better accountants or lawyers			0
that 's not fair , " he said			0
" there are companies that are parking money outside the country because of tax avoidance			2
we think it 's important that everybody pay something if they are effectively headquartered in the @entity4			0
" but he threatened to veto any bills that would weaken the health care law or rolls back any of the 2010 @entity151 financial services reforms -- which were recently thrust into the spotlight after liberals howled over the roll - back of one of those reforms in a deal this month to fund the government			2
" i think there are going to be some tough fights on those areas where we disagree , " @entity0 said			1
" if @entity62 seek to take health care away from people who just got it , they will meet stiff resistance from me			0
if they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis , i will say no , and i 'm confident that i will be able to uphold vetoes on those types of provisions			0
" here 's what @entity0 said about several other issues friday : @entity114 -- president @entity0 said the @entity114 -- which @entity62 congressional leaders have said they intend to approve legislation to authorize early next year -- is " not even going to be a nominal benefit to @entity4 consumers			1
" @entity0 did n't threaten to veto a bill that would take approval of the 1,179 - mile , @entity184 - to - @entity186 pipeline out of the @entity188 's hands			1
but he downplayed its potential effects and said that if @entity1 wants to create the kinds of construction jobs that could accompany the pipeline , it should instead approve bills to improve the country 's infrastructure			1
" there 's very little impact , nominal impact , on @entity4 gas prices -- what the average @entity4 consumer cares about -- by having this pipeline come through , " @entity0 said			2
" and sometimes , the way this gets sold is , ' let 's get this oil and it 's going to come here , ' and the implication is , it 's going to lower oil prices here in the @entity4 -- and it 's not			0
there 's a global oil market			0
" racial tensions with police -- @entity0 argued that " really concrete , practical " law enforcement reforms will result from a review his administration is currently producing , and sounded an optimistic tone about preventing deaths like @entity217 's in @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 's in @entity221 in the future			1
" what i do n't think is always captured in our political debates is , the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing			0
and people are basically good and have good intentions , " @entity0 said			2
" sometimes our institutions and our systems do n't work as well as they should			2
sometimes you 've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and has n't maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around			0
" " but if you offer practical solutions , i think people want to fix these problems , " he said			0
" this is n't a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying			0
i think that troubles everybody			0
so there 's an opportunity of all of us to come together and take a practical approach to these problems			0
" the economy -- he called 2014 the " strongest year for job growth since the 1990s " and pointing to rising middle class wages , increased energy production and lower gas prices , and highlighted recent economic reports that have identified a 57 - month streak of job growth , producing 11 million new positions			2
" as a country , we have every right to be proud of what we 've accomplished : more jobs , more people insured , a growing economy , shrinking deficits , bustling industry , booming energy -- pick any metric that you want ; @entity4 's resurgence is real			0
we are better off , " @entity0 said			2
he said gas prices are 70 cents lower this year than they were last @entity278 , and the @entity0 administration 's bailout of the automotive industry is " effectively over			2
" " yes , there were crises that we had to tackle around the world -- many that were unanticipated , " @entity0 said			2
" we have more work to do to make sure our economy , our justice system and our government work not just for the few but the many			2
but there is no doubt we can enter into the new year with renewed confidence that @entity4 is making significant strides where it counts			0
" @entity89 's @entity296 -- @entity86 " made a mistake " in halting the release of its film " @entity299 " after hackers that the @entity302 has linked to @entity89 stole the company 's documents and threatened theaters that showed the film , " @entity0 said			1
" we can not have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the @entity4 , because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie , imagine what they 'll do when they see a documentary that they do n't like , or news reports that they do n't like -- or even worse , imagine if producers or distributors or others start engaging in self - censorship because they do n't want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended , " @entity0 said			1
" so , you know , that 's not who we are			0
that 's not what @entity4 's about			0
again , i 'm sympathetic that @entity86 as a private company was worried about liabilities and this and that and the other			2
i wish they 'd spoken to me first			0
i would have told them , do not get into a pattern in which you 're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks , " he said .			0
