@entity0 , @entity1 -- wealthy @entity4 businessman @entity3 has run three times for statewide office in @entity1 over the past few decades and has never won			1
it was n't that long ago that most political observers here and in @entity10 thought his fourth campaign would be a losing battle too -- a @entity14 race against popular @entity16 gov. @entity15			1
but now , several public surveys as well as parties ' private polls show @entity3 within striking distance of snatching the seat of the late sen. @entity22 from @entity16 hands			1
in interview at his campaign headquarters , @entity3 , who joked that the @entity27 is to the left of him , said he believes voters are now more open to his anti-government views			1
" i 've been a conservative in @entity1 before that was popular , " said @entity3			1
" i 've seen a change in @entity1			0
" @entity3 's leading argument to voters fits neatly on a bumper sticker his campaign is distributing : " no rubber stamps			1
" in television and radio ads , and on the campaign trail , @entity3 is pounding @entity15 -- warning voters he would be a " rubber stamp " for president @entity44 and the @entity16 - controlled @entity45			1
those are stinging accusations in a conservative state that voted decisively for @entity48 over @entity44 , and where the president 's approval rating is extremely low			1
still , in any other election year , those charges might not resonate against @entity15 , who is incredibly popular in @entity1			1
but @entity16 strategists say their internal polling and focus groups show that tying @entity15 to @entity44 , @entity16 congressional leaders and their policies is dragging him down			1
it could be heard in @entity59 , @entity1 , along the @entity61 parade route			0
" i think he 's doing a great job here and i voted for him both times he 's run here in @entity1 , " said @entity62 , who had just waved to the governor going by , " but going to @entity10 , it scares me to death that he 's just going to be a rubber stamp			1
" it 's a dichotomy that speaks volumes about the frustration voters have with @entity10			2
@entity15 says he knows it 's a challenge for him			1
" yeah , they 're mad			0
" he said in an interview , " the democrats in @entity10 are in control and so absolutely it resonates to them			0
the bottom line here is that people do n't want government on their backs and they want them out of their pocket			0
" @entity15 also admits that the president 's unpopularity in @entity1 is a real issue			1
" it has made a difference in my race , " said @entity15 , but quickly noted , " president @entity44 is not on the ballot			1
he will not be a @entity96 senator			0
he 's definitely not on the ballot in @entity1			2
it 's me " the " me " @entity15 reminds people of is the governor they really like who has brought the state 's deficit down and kept unemployment lower than the national average			1
" our state is stronger now than ever			0
most states are struggling to survive , " he said			0
" we have not cut any services			0
we have not raised any taxes			0
we 're still cutting the taxes , you know , and we have not laid anybody off			0
" @entity15 also boasts about the broad coalition of support for his candidacy , from the @entity116 , to the @entity117 , to the @entity119 and coal miners associations			2
" i am fiercely independent , " @entity15 said			1
he is now working harder to reinforce that image and distance himself from his own party 's policies that are unpopular in his state			2
earlier this year , @entity15 said he supported the @entity16 's health care legislation			1
now he wants to repeal all but a handful of provisions , like no discrimination for pre-existing conditions			0
" that 's a pretty good start			0
why do n't you start with that ? kill the rest of it			0
start with what you agree on , " said @entity15			2
he also said in an interview that he now believes if the near $ 800 billion stimulus bill was before him as a senator , he would have voted no. " you know what ? the expansion of that , that 's not who i am , " said @entity15			1
the federal government allocated about $ 1.5 billion in stimulus money for @entity1 , but @entity15 said he would only take part of that , and insisted he would spend it slowly and judiciously			2
@entity15 and @entity16 here are hitting back against @entity3 by painting the wealthy miner and media magnate as out of touch with @entity1 voters			1
@entity16 strategists have been pushing the fact that @entity3 's family lives in @entity156 , not @entity1			1
the @entity4 candidate told @entity2 the reason for that is because his 12 - year - old daughter has special needs			2
" there are not a lot of services around for that special child , and so we picked out a school that would be a very good school for her , " said @entity3			2
" but we have houses here in @entity1			0
this is where i vote			0
this is where i 'm from			0
i 'm running for the @entity14 , but i 'll do anything i can to take care of my children , " he added			1
@entity16 are also sending around a photo of a pink marble driveway outside of @entity3 's @entity156 home			1
" i think it 's a good freedom of choice and the last time i checked here in @entity96 we are free , even to have a pink marble driveway , " he said			0
but @entity15 's television ad hits the @entity3 - is - not - like - you theme on an issue , not a personal preference : @entity3 wants to end the mimimum wage			1
" minimum wage is something @entity193 put in during the @entity194			0
it did n't work during the depression and it certainly has n't worked now , " @entity3 said			2
" the laws of supply and demand have to start working			0
we have to get back to free enterprise in this country			0
" he emphatically defended what he called his " conviction			0
" " minimum wage has never worked in this country			0
it 's something that hurts a lot of youth employment in this country , " he said			0
the @entity4 @entity14 candidate also wants to eliminate the @entity213 , which he calls redundant to what the states are doing , and get rid of the @entity216 too			1
" it costs us $ 32 billion a year to have the @entity216			0
they do n't drill wells and they do n't dig mines , " @entity3 said			2
if @entity3 makes it to the @entity14 , he says he 'll also vote to do away with the @entity223			1
" we spend millions of dollars every year just for the right to pay our taxes , but once again , do we really need to do that ? why do n't we simplify it ? " asked @entity3 , who says he is considering a " fair " or flat tax			2
it is unclear how much support @entity3 has for those views in @entity1			2
what is clear is that to beat the popular governor , he 's going to have to rely on a lot of voters like @entity236 , the manager at @entity238 diner in @entity239			1
@entity240 said in an interview that he does n't know a lot about @entity3 , and does n't much care			2
" i just know that the primary thing about him is that he 's going to oppose @entity44 , " said @entity240			0
" that 's what matters to me			0

@entity3 says he 's more conservative than the @entity27
