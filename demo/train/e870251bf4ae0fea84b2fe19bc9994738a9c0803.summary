@entity0 -- @entity5 's top @entity4 leader has asked rep. @entity6 to stop taking @entity7 over his support for abortion rights , the diocese said sunday			1
in a statement issued sunday , @entity11 bishop @entity10 said he told @entity6 in february 2007 that it would be " inappropriate " for him to continue receiving the fundamental @entity4 sacrament , " and i now ask respectfully that you refrain from doing so			1
" @entity6 , a @entity16 , is the son of the late @entity18 sen. @entity17 and a scion of the most prominent @entity4 family in modern @entity22 politics			0
in an interview published sunday , @entity6 told the @entity24 that @entity10 had barred him from receiving communion and instructed priests in the diocese not to administer the sacrament " because of the positions that i 've taken as a public official			1
" @entity10 , in a statement issued in response to the @entity6 interview , said his advice to the congressman was " pastoral and confidential , " and he was surprised that @entity6 chose to discuss it publicly			2
" i am disappointed that the congressman would make public my request of nearly three years ago that sought to provide solely for his spiritual well - being , " he said			0
the @entity4 strongly opposes abortion , which has been legal across the @entity22 since 1973			0
the @entity39 lobbied for tight restrictions on federal funding of abortion in the health care bill the @entity44 passed earlier this month			1
@entity6 opposed a provision that restricted the use of federal money for abortions , but voted in favor of final passage of the bill that included that language			1
efforts to reach @entity6 's representatives were unsuccessful sunday afternoon			2
but most bishops and priests oppose using communion as a " political weapon , " and @entity6 's disclosure may be an attempt to push back against the bishops ' support for the abortion restrictions in the @entity44 bill , @entity1 senior @entity56 analyst @entity55 said			1
" the catholic bishops have been fairly successful , at least to date , at putting abortion at the center of the debate over health care reform , and that obviously has generated some resentment from people who do n't share their views , " @entity55 said			1
@entity6 's decision to come forward " in effect puts the @entity4 bishops in a negative light , because it ends up making them look intolerant , " @entity55 said			2
@entity10 said sunday only that he asked @entity6 not to take @entity7			2
" i have no desire to continue the discussion of congressman @entity6 's spiritual life in public , " he said			1
" at the same time , i will absolutely respond publicly and strongly whenever he attacks the @entity4 , misrepresents the teachings of the church or issues inaccurate statements about my pastoral ministry			0
" in an october interview , @entity6 criticized the bishops for threatening to oppose the overall bill if it did not include those restrictions			0
that prompted @entity10 to call @entity6 's position " unacceptable to the church and scandalous to many of our members			0
" the latest exchange was comes on the 46th anniversary of the assassination of @entity6 's uncle , @entity103 , the nation 's first @entity4 president			0
@entity6 is the last member of his family serving in @entity106 .			0
