-- in the age of digital audio , what does good old - fashioned radio still have to offer ? @entity5 , the voice of @entity7 , consults the web site before talking into the mic			1
plenty , according to the creators of @entity7 , a community - based web site and a daily three - hour am radio program broadcast from @entity15 's @entity14			1
" radio is ' now , ' " says 22 - year - old @entity15 @entity17 , who implemented the web site			1
" [ radio ] is generally quick and live			0
this adds a special dynamic to the medium			0
moreover , it is still one of the most popular means of mass communication in @entity15			0
combining it with the power of the @entity30 can result in many new possibilities			0
" @entity7 is an experimental project of the @entity33 to promote public participation in audio - visual programming , eventually aiming to fuse its radio , television and web programs into a single interactive , real - time platform			1
like many online music sites , @entity7 is always looking for new music and emerging talents , but its primary focus is to preserve the memory of the @entity15 repertoire by resurfacing classic , forgotten or unknown songs			1
the @entity33 also happens to boast the biggest archive of @entity15 music in @entity15 , including more than 15,000 songs dating from the 1920 's to the present			1
" making it easy to search through the vast archive of songs was an important feature since version one of the web site , " says @entity17			1
producer @entity56 observes two types of @entity7 members : " there are people who listen to the show because they are fans of @entity15 music			1
there are others who like to produce the content on our site -- they collaborate actively with suggestions , playlists and all aspects of programming			0
" meanwhile , @entity7 team members @entity56 , speaker @entity5 and project manager @entity72 are busy podcasting interviews , moderating conversations , blogging , twittering and keeping the site relevant			1
old media gets new blood true to its non-visual origin , @entity7 's web site is strictly text - based , with icons that link to votes and streaming audio			1
and true to its web - based platform , the site has adopted , and adapted , all net - native systems for its daily operations			2
the site itself runs on the free @entity91 content - management system , which allows content to rank and flow according to input and feedback from the site 's online community			2
members who wish to contribute their own audio material to @entity7 's archive must either podcast it themselves first , or else they may upload it to the @entity102 - based @entity101 to clear it of online rights			1
given the quantity of music aired from the ever - expanding repertoire , copyright issues are the most common pretext to negotiation , most notably with @entity111 , a privately owned civil society for the collection and distribution of copyright managed by 10 @entity15 music associations			1
online , however , @entity7 distributes the entirety of its streaming content under a @entity121 license			0
the team has also been experimenting with the free @entity124 software to enable live blogging , chatting and twittering among audience , presenters and guests during its online coverage of radio and tv events , including the popular @entity133 tv show			2
@entity7 's first live event coverage in february 2008 was of @entity135 , a seven - day tech-fest that saw people camping out in tents with broadband cables while sharing ideas and technological innovations			2
in april 2008 , @entity7 struck again with its live coverage of @entity143 , @entity15 's largest cultural event , including art performances and exhibits in the streets of @entity14 during 24 continuous hours , attracting some 4 million people			1
" i came up with the idea of inviting the audience to report directly from the streets using their mobile phones , " says @entity17			0
" a telephone system was installed , and the calls from the participants were automatically recorded			0
our non-stop production team listened to every recording as they arrived and not only immediately published them online but geo - localized them on an interactive map of @entity14			0
" it was @entity7 's first truly collaborative coverage , as the audience produced most of the interviews and reviews , of not only the main attractions of @entity143 , but also the very obscure ones that otherwise would not be covered by the mainstream media			0
" next : music for the masses , on demand but still much remains to be done with @entity7 's original content -- music			2
" due to legal restrictions , it has been very difficult to exploit many of the possibilities previously imagined for the @entity7 web site , like listening online to playlists or to the thousands of songs in the archive , " @entity17 reflects			1
" live radio has been a great success and will remain so for a long time , but it is now clear the value of on - demand content -- whenever you want it , wherever you are , on whatever device you have handy -- from the @entity188 to your mobile phone			2
" @entity7 's web site not only introduces @entity15 music and culture to the international online community , it brings its programming well beyond the limited broadcasting range of the station 's native @entity14 to the rest of @entity15			1
in a nation notorious for violence rooted in social inequality , the democracy of the @entity200 -- not unlike radio -- is a welcome new medium of communication			0
" certainly @entity14 is the most ' wired ' city in the country , but the @entity30 and the possibilities associated with it have reached the most distant towns , " says @entity17			0
" it is amazing the value that such a technology delivers to a country in a fast development pace such as @entity15 -- from education to more subtle ways of social inclusion			0
" for @entity220 , @entity33 's radio coordinator , @entity7 's most memorable moment took place on december 17 , 2008 , when the program celebrated its first anniversary			2
" we had here in our studio the great composer @entity227 , a very well - known musician , singing and talking live with a very young singer , @entity229 , a teenager , actually , " she recalls			0
" the listeners were as happy as we were and , of course , as moved as the two artists were			0
it was a day in our history			0
