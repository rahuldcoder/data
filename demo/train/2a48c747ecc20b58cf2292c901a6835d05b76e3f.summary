@entity0 -- in a blow to efforts to keep direct negotiations between @entity3 and @entity7 from faltering , the @entity3 government is planning to construct new housing units in @entity0 , @entity3 and @entity10 sources confirmed friday			1
@entity3 army radio reported earlier that the @entity3 @entity12 issued a bid for 238 houses as part of a larger tender for housing construction in the country			2
the report said prime minister @entity20 was aware of the process , and that the @entity10 government had been notified			1
two @entity10 officials , speaking on condition of not being identified by name , told @entity1 that @entity3 had notified the @entity10 of the plan , but they added there was no agreement from @entity29 that it should go ahead			1
" this was in no way done with @entity10 approval , " one official said			0
" the government of @entity3 informed us to the intent to announce new tenders , and at every opportunity we urged the @entity3 not to proceed			0
" an @entity3 official speaking on condition of not being identified by name also said @entity3 told the @entity10 of its intention			1
a spokesman for @entity20 would not comment on the report			0
@entity7 negotiator @entity44 condemned the move , saying that the @entity3 prime minister has chosen " settlements over peace			1
" " we hold him responsible for undermining the direct negotiations , and i call upon the @entity10 and other members of the international community to condemn this act and to hold the @entity3 government responsible for the derailment of the direct negotiations , " @entity44 said			2
the issues of housing construction in @entity0 and @entity61 settlement building have been major sticking points in the newly revived direct talks between @entity3 and palestinians.the move would represent the first tender for @entity0 construction since march , when the @entity3 government announced the construction of 1,600 housing units in @entity0 while @entity10 vice president @entity70 was visiting @entity3			1
that announcement strained relations between @entity29 and the government of @entity20			0
the new @entity0 units would be built in the neighborhoods of @entity76 and @entity77 , which are home to thousands of @entity79 residents			1
the two neighborhoods are in the northern part of the city , but commonly considered part of @entity0 because they are located east of the @entity84 , the armistice line that separated @entity3 from @entity86 when @entity86 controlled @entity0 and the @entity61 prior to 1967			0
@entity3 seized @entity0 from @entity86 during the @entity87 in 1967 and considers it part of its sovereign capital , a claim not recognized by many in the international community			0
@entity7 want @entity0 as the capital of their future state			0
also friday , a report on @entity97 's state - run news agency @entity96 said @entity97 foreign minister @entity98 raised the possibility of the @entity100 calling for a @entity7 state to get a seat at the @entity103			2
such a move would bolster the @entity100 's call for full international recognition of a @entity7 state			2
