on june 25 , the @entity11 @entity10 struck down key parts of the @entity7 law that sought to deter illegal immigration , but let stand the controversial provision allowing police to check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws if " reasonable suspicion " exists that the person is in the @entity11 illegally			1
