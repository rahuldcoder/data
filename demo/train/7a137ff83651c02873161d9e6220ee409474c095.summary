-- the last time @entity2 led the @entity3 by as much as five points , it was february 2008			1
so it 's no surprise that @entity7 , whose last silverware came three years before that , is not getting carried away			2
the veteran manager knows , after all , that a few days is a long time in football			2
on tuesday his team lost 2 - 0 to @entity13 in the @entity14 , which many trumpeted as a sign that @entity18 's side had taken the ascendancy and would be the dominant force this season			1
but on saturday @entity18 's men crashed 2 - 0 to @entity23 , which had lost to the @entity3 's bottom side @entity25 the previous weekend , and @entity2 earned a five - point lead at the top with a comprehensive win by the same score against another title hopeful , @entity31			1
@entity2 's pre-season target @entity33 and fellow in - form striker @entity35 barely had a look - in for @entity31 , which had scored 12 goals in the past four games			1
@entity39 volleyed a 19th - minute opener after his header hit the post , and @entity43 joined @entity35 on 10 goals in all competitions just before the hour mark when the @entity48 midfielder was given time to shoot from outside the penalty area			2
" i am always confident , but of course there is a long way to go , " @entity7 said			0
" today was an important win for the team			0
" it was vital to win , i said that before the game and i do n't change my mind , because had we not won people would say ' yes , @entity2 at home they can not win the big games			1
' " the @entity13 game was an important game but not of the importance of today 's game			2
but still , it was a disappointment and it was important to respond today , to convince people that we can win these big games			0
" we had a good solidarity , a good focus , and i believe we have plenty of other big games coming up and this will help us deal well with them			0
" on wednesday , the @entity76 will travel to @entity77 to face @entity78 in a match which will have a big bearing on the @entity83 club 's hopes of progressing to the knockout stage of the @entity85			0
" who would have said that @entity13 would lose today at @entity23 after tuesday night ? but that 's the @entity3 and it 's down to consistency , " @entity7 said			1
" we are consistent since the first of january 2013 , with the same group ( of players )			0
we have shown since our massive blip against @entity93 ( at the start of this season ) that we have been very consistent			0
we have 10 games , 25 points			2
" while @entity7 appears calm , @entity18 admitted to being worried after the @entity23 defeat left his @entity13 side in second place , above @entity31 on goal difference			1
" i 'm angry because i do n't understand it , " said the former @entity103 manager , who won two epl titles in his first season at the @entity83 club			0
" of course i am worried , and i read in previous years it happened the same			0
" @entity13 were successful in cup competitions but not successful in the @entity3			1
last year in december , they were not in the race for the title because they were already 20 points behind			2
" @entity18 made nine changes to his team , and complained : " i made 11 mistakes			0
i should have picked another 11 and not this one			0
" while the @entity121 coach 's fortunes may have momentarily dipped , those of the @entity118 clubs soared this weekend			0
defending champion @entity122 won 3 - 1 at @entity124 , the fourth victory in a row in all competitions for under - pressure manager @entity128 -- who saw @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity132 score in the first half as his side stayed eighth			1
@entity135 moved up to fourth -- six points behind @entity2 -- with a 7 - 0 thrashing of third - bottom @entity138 , having lost at @entity13 last sunday			1
@entity140 goalkeeper @entity139 was dropped following his costly blunder at the end of that match , and his @entity145 replacement @entity146 has now kept two clean sheets following the midweek @entity14 win at @entity23			1
@entity149 's eighth league goal this season moved the @entity152 striker to the top of the scoring charts alongside @entity35 , while @entity155 hit his fifth , @entity157 his fourth and @entity159 his third among seven individual scorers			2
@entity162 goalkeeper @entity161 was also a notable name on the scoresheets after his wind - assisted effort deceived @entity167 counterpart @entity166 after just 13 seconds			1
the @entity168 international became the fifth keeper to hit the target since the @entity3 began in 1992 , while @entity173 's equalizer left @entity167 in fifth place , behind @entity135 on goal difference			1
" as a manager that is the first time i 've had to experience a moment as unlucky as that , " said @entity167 's @entity176			2
" i do n't blame him at all			0
i think it had more to do with the weather conditions			0
" he did n't apologize for anything because he did n't have to			0
the wind was changing gusts completely all the time and it is a ground which is open on three sides , which makes it even more windy			0
" @entity190 moved up to 11th with a 2 - 0 win that dropped @entity192 to the bottom of the table , despite nine - man @entity25 losing 1 - 0 at 10th - placed @entity196			1
@entity197 drew 0 - 0 with @entity93 in saturday 's other match .			1
