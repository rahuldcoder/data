-- second seed @entity1 was sent crashing out of @entity3 , as he was beaten in five sets by unknown @entity6 player @entity5			1
@entity5 , ranked 100 in the world , sealed the biggest win of his life to record one of the biggest shocks in @entity13 history			1
he worried @entity1 in a gruelling first - set tie break , but when @entity1 held his nerve to win , it looked as though normal service would be resumed			2
but @entity5 fought back to win 6 - 7 ( 9 - 11 ) , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 4 in three hours and 18 minutes and become the lowest - ranked player to beat @entity1 in a @entity13 tournament			1
@entity1 has not lost a @entity13 match at the second round stage for seven years , and @entity5 looked as surprised as everyone , as he described the win as " a miracle			1
" even so , @entity1 was outplayed as @entity5 controlled the game throughout and kept his nerve as the pressure grew throughout against a player with 11 @entity13 titles to his name			2
fourth seed @entity33 , in the same half of the draw as @entity1 and @entity5 , was also given a stern test by big - serving @entity37 @entity36 before winning through to the third round at @entity3			1
the 6ft 10in @entity36 made it an uncomfortable afternoon in the heat of @entity41 for @entity43 number one @entity33			1
@entity33 edged the first set 7 - 5 but wasted a couple of passing opportunities in the second set tie break as @entity36 levelled			2
but the @entity48 responded well , winning the third set 6 - 2 in just 33 minutes before surviving another tie break to win through in four sets in three hours and 27 minutes			0
the look of relief on @entity33 's face when victory was confirmed told the story of the game -- and that feeling was echoed all around @entity41 , as @entity33 left to a standing ovation			0
" winning is all that matters , " @entity33 said			0
he added : " he 's a tough opponent and there are very few who play like him			0
" @entity33 will meet @entity64 in the third round after his @entity67 opponent @entity66 retired through injury when trailing 7 - 5 4 - 1			0
another home player in fine form was @entity43 number two @entity72 , who took 10th seed @entity75 all the way in a gruelling five - set match			1
fish won the first set before being pegged back and saw a match point go to waste in the fourth set before @entity72 took it on a tied - break			0
but @entity75 broke his young opponent 's serve -- and his brave resistence -- midway through the fifth to seal a 6 - 3 5 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 3 - 7 ) 6 - 3			0
@entity87 @entity86 also won in four sets as he saw off @entity89 6 - 2 6 - 3 1 - 6 6 - 4 on @entity90 .			0
