-- the good news is that improving economies in developing nations is allowing more people to eat better , but the @entity5 estimates that nearly 1 billion people will still face chronic hunger this year			1
the @entity8 and the @entity9 estimated that 925 million people , almost three times the population of the @entity12 , will go hungry			1
that 's down from 1.023 billion people in 2009 and the first decrease in 15 years			2
" but with a child dying every six seconds because of undernourishment related problems , hunger remains the world 's largest tragedy and scandal , " said @entity8 director - general @entity16 in a statement			0
" this is absolutely unacceptable			0
" more than 40 percent of the hungry live in the two largest nations , @entity28 and @entity29			1
only 19 million of the world 's undernourished live in developed countries			2
the @entity5 attributed the lower number to renewed economic growth expected this year , particularly in developing nations , coupled with a drop in food prices since mid- 2008			1
however , recent spikes in food costs could hamper a further reduction of hunger , the @entity8 warned			0
among the study 's key findings were : two thirds of undernourished people live in just seven countries -- @entity28 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity29 , the @entity50 and @entity51			2
the region with the most undernourished people continues to be @entity53 and the @entity54 , with 578 million			0
but the proportion of undernourished people remains highest in @entity56 -- at 30 percent in 2010 , or 239 million .			0

global hunger *declines* for the first time in 15 years
925 million people will still go hungry , according to @entity5
more than 40 percent of the world 's hungry live in @entity28 and @entity29
