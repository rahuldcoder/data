-- perhaps the biggest splash in the early going of this year 's @entity2 in @entity3 was made by @entity4 with its unveiling of @entity6			1
and while there 's a video - gaming aspect to it , the feature promises a lot more ( which , to be honest , is the sort of thing that plays bigger in the rest of the world than it does at @entity2 , where the crowd is heavily made up of hard - core gamers who were probably more excited about the preview of " @entity18 " )			0
less than a day after @entity6 was introduced , details are still emerging about how it will work			1
but what 's clear is that the application , which will work hand in hand with the upcoming @entity26 operating system , is @entity4 's play to make the @entity28 an indispensable tool for all kinds of entertainment			1
first of all ... @entity6 is not a kind of glass			2
maybe it 's the buzz about the @entity35 featured on the new @entity37 smartphone			0
or the fact that touchscreens are a key part of the feature			0
or -- you know -- the fact that they called it @entity6			2
but some folks have been confused on that score			0
the feature is actually an app. it will work with the @entity26 operating system , which runs on both pcs and mobile devices , to link up tablets and smartphones with the xbox console and , by extension , a user 's tv			1
so i need a @entity61 phone or tablet ? no , you do n't			2
obviously , @entity4 would prefer you buy something such as the @entity65 or one of the many tablets expected to be released once a final version of @entity26 is up and running later this year			0
but @entity6 will also work with @entity69 devices , such as the @entity70 and @entity71 , or mobile devices running @entity75 's @entity74 operating system			1
as long as you have an @entity28 and either a pc running @entity61 8 , mobile devices running @entity26 or an @entity78 or @entity74 device , you 're good to go			1
how is this different ? there are other products that do similar things -- from @entity69 's @entity83 , which streams content from an @entity70 or @entity71 to your tv , to apps such as @entity88 that provide bonus content to enhance tv shows and movies			1
but , at least as @entity4 describes it , @entity6 will pull lots of those features together into one app as well as take them further			1
yes , you can start watching a show on your tablet or phone , then send it to your tv or vice versa			0
but they say the app also will recognize tv shows or movies you were watching through an @entity105 device and automatically serve up that content without you having to look for it			2
during a demo at @entity4 's media event monday , as the speaker watched a scene from @entity88 's " @entity110 , " a map of the show 's expansive world popped up			0
then , there 's the gaming aspect			0
much as @entity120 's promised @entity119 incorporates a handheld device with gameplay on a traditional console , players will be able to enhance gameplay on their mobile devices as well			1
during the demo , a tablet was used to call a football play in " @entity129			0
" add to that the voice and motion - control abilities already available with the @entity133 system , and you can see @entity4 's vision for making the console a centerpiece for all electronic entertainment			2
if the @entity105 is the brains , @entity6 " gives users the limbs needed for a full functional , self - sufficient media beast , " @entity139 wrote			2
when ? and how much ? the app is free			0
so , as long as you have the right hardware , there presumably will be no extra cost			0
@entity4 says @entity6 will be available this fall , which is about the same time a final version of @entity26 has been promised .			1

@entity6 aims to make the console a key entertainment component
@entity154 will tie tv and console with tablets and smartphones
it uses @entity61 8 , but @entity69 and @entity74 mobile devices also will work
*smartglass* app will be free and available this fall
