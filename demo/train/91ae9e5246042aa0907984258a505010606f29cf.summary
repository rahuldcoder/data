@entity0 picked up a highly prized endorsement wednesday from former @entity3 gov. @entity2 after a convincing victory the night before in the @entity6 primary but then saw a top adviser 's televised comment provide new ammunition to his trailing rivals in the @entity12 presidential race			1
@entity13 , @entity0 's senior campaign adviser , was asked in a @entity15 interview wednesday morning whether the former @entity17 governor had been forced to adopt conservative positions in the rugged race that could hurt his standing with moderates in november 's general election			1
" i think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign			2
everything changes , " @entity13 responded			0
" it 's almost like an @entity28			1
you can kind of shake it up , and we start all over again			0
" rival candidates @entity33 and @entity34 , who are vying for conservative support against the more moderate @entity0 , seized on the comment as indicative of their longstanding criticism that @entity0 shifts his positions on issues such as health care reform and abortion to suit his political needs			1
@entity43 brought out an @entity28 at a campaign appearance in @entity45 , where the next primary takes place saturday			1
" you have to stand for something that lasts longer than this , " @entity43 said at the @entity49 event , holding the drawing toy invented in 1959			0
" you could not have found a more perfect illustration of why people distrust @entity0 than to have his ( adviser ) say that the @entity28 allows you to erase everything in the general election , " @entity43 added			1
" you have to read the guy 's quote to realize -- if he had set out to highlight for everybody why we distrust @entity0 , i think he could n't have done a better job			1
" @entity33 's campaign posted a photo on @entity66 of the candidate using an @entity28 , saying it showed him " studying up on ( @entity0 's ) policy positions			1
" @entity0 " will say what he needs to say to win the election before him , and if he has to say something different because it 's a different election and a different group of voters , he will say that , too , " @entity33 said while campaigning in @entity69 , @entity45			1
" well , that should be comforting to all of you who are voting in this primary			0
" @entity13 later said he was referring to the campaign as a whole , and @entity0 spoke to reporters after an afternoon event to try to exercise some damage control			1
" organizationally , a general election campaign takes on a different profile , " @entity0 said			1
" the issues i am running on will be exactly the same			0
i am running as a conservative @entity12			2
i was a conservative @entity12 governor			2
i will be running as a conservative @entity12 nominee , at that point hopefully , for president			2
the policies and positions are the same			0
" however , the @entity28 remark -- coming on what should have been a triumphant day that happened to be @entity0 's 43rd wedding anniversary -- threatened to sap attention from his growing momentum toward winning the nomination to face president @entity101 in november			1
@entity0 scored a solid victory in tuesday 's @entity6 primary , followed by the endorsement wednesday from @entity2 , a respected @entity12 leader once considered a possible presidential contender this year			1
" now is the time for @entity12 to unite behind gov. @entity0 and take our message of fiscal conservatism and job creation to all voters this fall , " @entity2 , the brother of one @entity12 former president and son of another , said in a statement			1
a spokesman for @entity43 said the @entity2 endorsement merely demonstrated the @entity12 establishment 's push for @entity0 instead of a less conventional candidate like the former @entity123 speaker			1
" it 's a completion of the establishment trifecta , " @entity43 spokesman @entity124 said in reference to endorsements for @entity0 by former president @entity127 , former sen. @entity128 and now @entity2			1
analysts sounded like the @entity12 campaign was essentially over			1
@entity0 's @entity6 victory showed " the writing 's on the wall " for the rest of the field , said @entity15 analyst @entity138 , a longtime @entity0 critic			1
" this comes down to @entity0 , " @entity138 said			0
" not only is he the front - runner but the nominee			0
this is a clear win for @entity0 tonight in a state with blue - collar voters , with industrial voters and suburban voters			0
" the @entity6 result followed established patterns in the @entity12 race , with @entity0 doing well in urban and suburban areas while @entity33 , the former @entity151 senator who is his main conservative rival , ran strong in rural areas			1
in @entity154 , @entity0 had 55 % of the total with 99 % of precincts reporting , while @entity33 notched 25 % , according to the city 's election website			1
in @entity161 , one of the surrounding counties near @entity154 , @entity0 had 56 % with all precincts reporting , according to the clerk 's office website , and @entity33 had 28 %			2
@entity166 rep. @entity165 and @entity43 trailed well back , according to unofficial results from local clerks and election boards			0
the results gave @entity0 at least 41 of the 54 delegates up for grabs in the state , increasing his total to 562 , according to @entity15 's estimate			2
@entity33 is second with 249 , @entity43 third with 137 and @entity165 last with 69			0
a total of 1,144 delegates is needed to clinch the @entity12 nomination			0
@entity0 's campaign trumpeted the @entity6 showing as a broad - based triumph , seeking to overcome questions about the candidate 's ability to win over the conservative @entity12 base			1
" @entity0 won with tea party voters			0
he won with @entity189 , " campaign spokeswoman @entity188 said			0
" there are a lot of groups within the @entity12 , and gov. @entity0 has won their votes			1
" in remarks to cheering supporters , @entity0 resumed his front - runner attacks on @entity101 's economic , health care and spending policies			2
" the simple truth is , this president does not understand the genius of this economy , " @entity0 said , adding that " the @entity205 economy is fueled by freedom			0
" @entity33 skipped @entity6 on primary night and awaited the results in @entity209 in his home state of @entity151			0
in his concession speech , below a banner that proclaimed " @entity212 , " he said he was staying in the race to battle a government that he complained was " trying to order us around			0
" " this is an election about fundamental and foundational things , " @entity33 said , attacking @entity0 's claim of greater business and government management experience			2
" this is an election about not who 's the best person to manage @entity225 or manage the economy			0
we do n't need a manager , we need someone who 's going to pull government up by the roots and do something to liberate the private sector in @entity205			0
" @entity33 said he expected to do better in upcoming primaries and caucuses , adding : " we are feeling very , very good about winning @entity45 on saturday			2
" @entity33 has made a strong showing in traditionally conservative @entity238 states , winning @entity239 and @entity240 a week ago , while @entity0 finished third			0
another @entity33 victory in @entity45 would continue the pattern of the race , while a @entity0 win would signal growing support from the conservative base that he needs to finish off his rivals			1
@entity0 's @entity6 victory followed an overwhelming triumph sunday in @entity250 , where @entity0 got 83 % of the vote and picked up all 20 delegates at stake			2
@entity43 , who appears increasingly unlikely to mount another comeback after two previous campaign surges , issued a statement tuesday night blasting @entity0 for relying on his vast financial resources rather than offering " solutions that hold the president accountable for his failures			2
" " to defeat @entity101 , @entity12 ca n't nominate a candidate who relies on outspending his opponents 7 - 1 , " @entity43 said			0
@entity263 , the @entity0 spokeswoman , responded : " that 's like a basketball team complaining they lost to another team because their players were too tall			2
" @entity270 is part of a campaign			0
so is organization , " @entity263 said			0
@entity43 plans to head to @entity45 , as does @entity165 , the libertarian champion with a small but devoted following .			0

@entity0 responds to @entity28 comment by affirming his conservatism
rivals jump on @entity0 aide 's remark that his campaign can reset like an @entity28
@entity2 endorses @entity0 and calls for @entity12 unity
the @entity45 primary saturday is the next contest in the @entity12 presidential race
