you ca n't escape the headlines			0
an @entity3 going to college in the @entity5 is gunned down by teens who police say killed him out of boredom			1
a few days later , a @entity11 veteran is beaten to death for reasons still unknown			0
the death of @entity3 @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , even sparked calls for @entity3 to boycott travel to the @entity5 because of all the violence			1
two shocking , high - profile crimes , one question : " what the hell is going on ! ? " @entity26 user @entity25 wrote on @entity28 's @entity26 page			0
" this country better wake up ... our youth have serious issues , " @entity29 wrote			0
although the cases have struck a nerve with their disturbing randomness and apparent cruelty , the reality is that living in the @entity5 may never have been safer , and you 're much more likely to be the victim of a crime committed by someone you know than you are to be assaulted by a stranger			1
nearly eight of every 10 murders in the @entity5 between 1993 and 2008 were committed by someone the victim knew , according a 2010 report by the federal @entity51			1
the report did n't include figures for 2011 or 2012			0
similarly , nearly two out of every three nonviolent crimes were committed by someone the victim knew			2
pair that with figures on overall crime : according to the @entity60 , the violent crime rate in the @entity5 is about half what it was in 1992			1
and between 1992 and 2011 , the annual number of murders in the @entity5 fell from 23,760 to 14,612 despite a growing population			2
rape , robbery , assault , even property crimes also fell in a well - documented decline that has gone on for years , albeit with a small upturn in 2012			2
criminologists have cited shifts in the crack cocaine market , which drove many 1990s - era murders ; an increase in the number of offenders behind bars ; the country 's aging population ; and more sophisticated policing for the declines			0
but perceptions of crime have n't always followed the reality			2
in may , a @entity88 study found that 56 % of @entity5 believe that gun violence is higher than it was 20 year ago , even though it has fallen precipitously since the 1990s			0
and in 2011 , @entity90 found that 68 % of @entity5 believed crime was getting worse , despite the reality of declining crime rates nationwide .			1

crime rates have been declining for years
most crimes are committed by *people* known to the victims
but perception of crime does n't always match *statistics*
many @entity5 *residents* believe crime is getting worse
