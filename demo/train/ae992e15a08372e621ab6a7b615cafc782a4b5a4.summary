it was a stark and painful reminder			2
the sound of fireworks echoing through the streets of @entity4 as the clock dragged toward midnight underlining the fact that so many of the victims of @entity8 were on their way to @entity10 to celebrate the new year there			2
and for the past four days , the @entity15 crew has witnessed the shock , disbelief , frustration , and finally the devastating realization from the families of those missing			1
since sunday evening , we have been staffing our live camera position 24 hours a day just a few paces from the crisis center at @entity26			2
we have spoken to family members and friends , trying to negotiate the fine line between prying and reporting , trying to show the human side of a disaster without gross intrusion into private grief			1
what has been noticeable has been the stoic dignity of the family members we have met			1
bad weather hinders search of course there have been scenes of raw emotion			2
we met @entity44 late on sunday evening , leaning on the arm of her daughter for support			2
her brother @entity51 , his wife and two children were on 8501			0
as she told us her story , she repeatedly broke down			0
her brother , she said always flew @entity54 , the national airline			0
but this time for some reason he had chosen @entity57			0
she paused and broke down again as the awful truth hit home			0
but she managed to contain her grief and resume her quiet , dignified wait for news			1
and that was how most family members we saw at the crisis center dealt with their situation			1
the atmosphere inside the center as they gathered for regular updates was restrained			0
they were shielded from the media but windows lining the building allowed the media to look inside			0
up to 100 family members sat quietly , grim - faced			1
some talked but most just stared ahead and waited			0
one image that stuck with me : a man , head bowed and tears streaming down his face , his hand resting on the shoulder of a boy in front , most likely his son			0
but as the days wore on , more and more began to voice their frustration about the lack of information			1
authorities set up video links and @entity97 calls with search and rescue headquarters in @entity99 , and tried to increase the number of briefings , but there was little concrete news to relate			1
a press conference from search and rescue in @entity99 broke the news everyone had feared but needed to know			1
the mystery of @entity109 had been solved			0
debris had been found , and authorities were 95 % certain it was part of the @entity57 flight			0
where does investigation go now ? as if the news itself was n't bad enough , the local broadcaster carrying the press conference live began showing pictures of a body , with few clothes remaining , floating in the water			1
our cameraman @entity124 was filming and he described the scene as chaos as relatives broke down			0
stretchers were brought for at least two people who fainted			0
one close friend of a passenger described scenes of hysteria , screaming and people collapsing at the news of the debris and compounded by the brutal pictures carried on television			1
but apart from that one outpouring , the scene at the airport has mostly been one of quiet dignity in the face of unimaginable loss			1
many on board were families			1
in one case seven members of the same family , now thought to have perished			1
who was aboard the plane ? the waiting goes on as the weather conditions obstruct search operations to locate the main fuselage , thought to contain most of the passengers			2
the grieving goes on , too , but behind closed doors			0
and it will continue long after the last of the passengers ' remains are finally brought to this city , identified and buried .			2

@entity15 crew *watches* as passengers ' families wait for news
crew notices stoic dignity of the family members
as the days wore on , more and more began to voice their frustration
