after more than seven weeks of heavy fighting , @entity0 and @entity1 have agreed to an open - ended ceasefire			1
the truce announced tuesday puts off dealing with core long - term issues on both sides of a bitter conflict that killed around 2,200 people			1
but @entity0 agreed to ease the blockade on @entity12 , open border crossings for more aid to pass through and extend the fishing limit off the coast to 6 miles , according to a senior @entity16 government official			1
both sides agreed to return to @entity19 for further @entity16 - mediated talks , the official said			2
@entity1 -- as it has after every battle with @entity0 -- declared the outcome a victory			1
but @entity0 said that @entity1 , which holds power inside @entity12 , finally accepted an offer that it had repeatedly rejected earlier in the war			1
" we hope that this time , the ceasefire will stick , " @entity0 government spokesman @entity27 said			2
" and i think now , as the dust will begin to clear , many people will be asking : why is it that today @entity1 accepted the very same @entity16 framework that it rejected a month ago ? " ultimately , so much bloodshed could have been avoided , " he added			1
cheers in @entity12 early in the conflict , @entity0 openly accepted @entity16 's ceasefire proposal and slammed @entity1 for not doing so			1
analysts saw @entity16 's offers as one of many signs that the fighting was a proxy war for the broader @entity45 , with key powers such as @entity19 supporting @entity0 's fight against @entity1			1

' tackle the root causes ' tuesday 's truce did n't deal with @entity0 's main demand for the demilitarization of @entity12			1
it also did n't address @entity1 ' calls for the rebuilding and reopening of @entity12 's airport and the establishment of a seaport , as well as the release of prisoners held by @entity0			1
@entity65 say @entity0 and @entity16 's blockade of @entity12 suffocates the economy of the small , impoverished territory			1
but @entity0 says @entity1 ca n't be trusted to not import weapons			1
" any peace effort that does not tackle the root causes of the crisis will do little more than set the stage for the next cycle of violence , " a spokesman for @entity99 @entity98 ban ki - moon said tuesday of the ceasefire			1
" after 50 days of profound human suffering and devastating physical destruction , any violations of the ceasefire would be utterly irresponsible , " he said			2

' @entity119 ' the truce appeared similar to a previous agreement reached after a short conflict in november 2012			0
" in the end , @entity0 had two alternatives : either to occupy @entity12 and destroy @entity1 or to go to a ceasefire , " a senior @entity0 official said on condition of anonymity			1
" once we decided not to occupy @entity12 , we pushed for the same conditions that led to the end of hostilities in 2012			0
" he said that he was " not confident " the ceasefire would last , but that if @entity1 wants it to hold , it will			2
@entity0 has said its military actions destroyed dozens of tunnels beneath @entity12 , some of which extended under the border and were used by @entity65 militants to launch attacks			0
