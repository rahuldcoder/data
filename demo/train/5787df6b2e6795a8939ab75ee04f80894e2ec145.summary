@entity0 -- two key republicans on the @entity3 announced their opposition to @entity6 nominee @entity5 on friday , a further sign the party 's conservative base is uniting against president @entity10 's first high court pick			1
@entity5 's @entity6 nomination is to be put to a vote in the @entity3 next week			1
@entity14 sen. @entity13 , the former chairman of the committee , and @entity18 sen. @entity17 , head of the party 's @entity3 campaign committee , announced on the @entity3 floor their intention to vote against the 55 - year - old federal appeals court judge			1
@entity13 's decision came as something of a surprise			1
the veteran @entity28 has voted for every high court nominee in his 32 - year @entity3 career , including president @entity32 's two liberal choices , justices @entity33 and @entity35			1
@entity13 had praised @entity5 's " credentials and experience " and the fact that she would be the first @entity40 justice			1
but despite the nominee 's compelling life story , @entity13 said that controversial off - the - bench comments by @entity5 troubled him			1
" i reluctantly , and with a heavy heart , have found that i can not support her nomination to the @entity48 @entity6 , " @entity13 said in a written statement			2
" in truth , i wish president @entity10 had chosen a @entity40 nominee that all senators could support			2
i believe it would have done a great deal for our great country			0
although @entity5 has a compelling life story and dedication to public service , her statements and record were too much at odds with the principles about the judiciary in which i deeply believe			0
" @entity17 candidly admitted that his opposition to @entity5 could carry political risks in his home state , where one - third of the electorate is @entity40			2
" voting to confirm a judge -- this judge or any judge -- despite doubts would certainly be the politically expedient thing to do , but i do n't believe it would be the right thing to do , " he said on the @entity3 floor			0
" many of her public statements reflected a surprisingly radical view of the law , " he said			1
he argued that the " stakes are simply too high for me to confirm someone who could address all these issues from a liberal , activist perspective			0
" seven other republicans have said they would vote against @entity5			0
five mostly moderate @entity28 lawmakers announced their intention to back her			0
a vote is scheduled for tuesday in the @entity3 , followed by an expected final floor vote a week later			2
there is little doubt about the outcome , and @entity28 leaders have said no filibuster is planned			0
conservative groups have been pushing @entity28 senators to rally hard against @entity5			1
the @entity97 stressed the intensity of its opposition to her nomination thursday , warning senators that their votes will be considered in its future candidate evaluations			2
among those supporting @entity5 is conservative sen. @entity106 , @entity108 - @entity107 , whose folksy questioning of the nominee during last week 's confirmation hearings attracted wide attention			1
his decision brought a rebuke from the conservative @entity115 , which slammed @entity106 's support " based upon his apparent willful blindness to her record , both on the bench and off , of indulging her own ethnic and gender biases , personal political views , and liberal agenda in the name of ' law			1
' " the network 's counsel , @entity128 , dismissed @entity106 's " cynical , pandering comments during the @entity3 hearings , which were clearly aimed at drawing attention to himself rather than illuminating the role of the court in our constitutional republic			2
" some @entity28 moderates have privately expressed concern that attacking @entity5 could hurt the party 's efforts to attract more hispanics and women , especially since her confirmation seems assured			0
@entity5 's " wise @entity146 " comments were cited by @entity17 and others as reason for opposing her			1
the @entity18 @entity28 said @entity5 was less than forthcoming when explaining her remarks in a 2001 speech			0
@entity5 told a group of @entity40 law students that " i would hope that a wise @entity146 woman , with the richness of her experience , would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life			0
" she has echoed the sentiment in related talks she has given over the years			0
@entity17 said the remarks contrasted sharply with her pledge during her confirmation hearings to rule on cases without personal bias			0
" who is the real judge @entity5 ? " he asked .			0

sen. @entity13 says nominee 's off - the - bench comments are troubling
sen. @entity17 cites " surprisingly radical view of the law "
vote on nomination to come soon , with *approval* expected
