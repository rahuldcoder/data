@entity26 , a men 's figure skating two - time olympic gold medalist , said he did n't think @entity14 was the whole package			1
it did n't help that one of the judges had been suspended for a year for trying to fix an event at the @entity34 16 years ago			0
or that another is married to the head of the @entity10 figure skating federation			1
@entity39 figure skater @entity38 also slammed the judging thursday night			2

she even finished behind @entity10 skater @entity45 , who fell more than once			2

" it 's debatable , but not a robbery , " wrote @entity68 of @entity69			0
" @entity14 skated well enough to win gold			2
she had a carefully constructed program with seven triples , five of which were in a combo			0
@entity1 had six and three , respectively			2
thus , @entity14 was going in with a higher total and made more margin for error , which she took advantage of with a minor hop after one exchange			2
" @entity14 's technical score of 75.54 dwarfed @entity1 's technical score of 69.69			1
results : women 's figure skating results but others were n't convinced			1
