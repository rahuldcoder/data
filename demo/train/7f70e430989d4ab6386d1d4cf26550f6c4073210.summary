in fact , that was the idea , was n't it ? @entity1 -- the pugnacious , " nation " - inspiring champion -- hosted his last " @entity9 " on @entity8 thursday night			1
about six months from now , he will take a new role as host of @entity13 ' " @entity12			0
" it will be like @entity15 changing into @entity16 -- or , perhaps , into @entity15 for the @entity1 we 've been watching bears only a tangential resemblance to the real thing			1
the real @entity1 , as revealed in profiles in the @entity24 and the @entity25 , is a modest family man , a devout @entity26 with three children who 's " extremely normal , " one of his neighbors said			1
the @entity1 of the " @entity9 " is bombastic and ironic , equal parts @entity28 ( who 's referred to as " @entity28 " on the show ) and @entity31 , the man the real @entity1 is replacing			1
nevertheless , it 's worth noting that bombast and irony have paid off handsomely for the onetime " @entity36 " correspondent and " @entity38 " actor			2
in some ways , he has become the power he 's ridiculed			0
without @entity1 , we would n't have a word for what 's now called " truthiness , " the concept that if you feel it in your gut , it must be true			1
( it was @entity51 's word of the year in 2006 : the power of @entity1 at work			1
) we would n't " @entity54 " and the sometimes humorless people who are elected to them			0
and we would n't understand how to turn the other cheek to @entity59 activists who wanted to # @entity60			0
@entity1 ' @entity12 ' staying in @entity24 yes , occasionally the @entity1 alter ego pushed boundaries a little fiercely			1
when he was the featured entertainer at the 2006 @entity63 , his scathing jokes about president @entity65 , the @entity65 administration and the news media -- delivered with all mere feet away -- hit close to home			0
( so close , in fact , that the entertainment for the 2007 dinner was provided by the much safer @entity72			0
) and then there was the @entity74 , @entity74			0
@entity1 thought it would show the absurdity of campaign finance laws			1
it did -- but mainly because both @entity79 and @entity80 were willing to go along with it			0
anything for money , it seems			0
it 's a funhouse mirror that @entity1 's partner in crime , @entity86 , has willingly supported			1
both have found comedy gold through mockery , but if @entity86 is the exasperated uncle , @entity1 has been the mischievous nephew			2
by questioning reality through a character , @entity1 has actually shown how absurd real reality often is			1
@entity94 fills in for @entity1 no wonder he 'll be missed			2
who else can symbolize @entity96 with a @entity98 's ice cream flavor , a @entity100 device and a minor league hockey mascot ? @entity1 is the @entity103			1
even president @entity94 paid tribute			0
occasionally he 's shown us who he is underneath the character , of course			2
he answered a @entity109 very much as himself , and took the time to be a grown man for a @entity113 magazine feature			0
he may be that guy when his " @entity12 " stint begins			0
but we do n't know who the new @entity1 will be			2
will he be full of smarm , like a @entity118 parody ? a puckish intellectual , a la @entity119 ? a rollicking @entity121 type ? whatever he is , he 's said he 's leaving the " @entity9 's " @entity1 behind			1
@entity1 's time slot will be well - cared for , thanks to @entity124 and the " @entity125 , " which will follow @entity86 's " @entity36 " starting january 19			1
but his impact may never be equaled			0
surprisingly , @entity1 was worried that the character would n't sustain			1
as he told the @entity25 , " i thought topical stuff had an ephemeral quality -- it would be meaningless in a week			0
i wanted my character to be eternal			0
" no worries there , @entity1			2
opinion : goodbye , ' @entity1 ' ?			2

@entity1 wraps up " @entity9 " thursday night
@entity1 's *blustering* " @entity1 " character has made him famous
@entity141 is a soft - spoken family man
@entity1 will take over for @entity31 in 2015
