-- as @entity4 president @entity3 's calculated and risky backtracking on the @entity1 - @entity4 security agreement puts him on a collision course with most @entity4 , the @entity1 needs to demonstrate patience , take the @entity4 public 's side and be tactful at a sensitive time in a highly volatile part of the world			1
observers describe @entity3 's actions as erratic , arrogant or impulsive			1
others suggest that he be ignored or bypassed			0
to some , he seems to be displaying signs of exhaustion and irrationality			0
these views miscast @entity3 's motives and miss the point of his tactical political maneuvering			1
he is engaging in canny clan - style brinksmanship			0
@entity3 's instincts are shaped by his place in history			1
he is bargaining with the @entity1 over a popular deal to allow up to 15,000 foreign troops to remain in @entity4 after the formal end of combat operations in 2014			1
what lies at the heart of his aggressive posturing is the future of his family 's political and financial interests after his second term ends in 2014			1
that strategy has also been markedly shaped by 12 long and strenuous years of machiavellian exploits , insecurity and frustration with his @entity45 backers			0
but , @entity4 , wary of @entity3 's strategy and mindful of their destiny after 2014 , are not in a mood to tolerate such antics so late in the game			1
as international forces start ending their decade - long combat mission , foreign aid is shrinking considerably and @entity4 security forces are tested by a nagging proxy war with the @entity57			2
most @entity4 are not only concerned about the future , but also about preserving the gains of the past 12 years in education , health , gender rights , media , entrepreneurship and even political freedoms			1
for its part , @entity66 needs to be mindful of the stakes and not fall into @entity3 's trap			1
arm - twisting is neither advised nor helpful at this stage as @entity4 exert increasing pressure at home to make the president think twice about his responsibilities and priorities			0
anxieties are running high about @entity3 's last - minute wheeling - and - dealing and domestic and regional spoilers are sharpening their knives , hoping to see the back of the @entity1 and @entity81 departing @entity82 for good next year if the agreement is not signed			1
if it 's not signed and foreign troops must withdraw completely , the situation is ripe for terrorist outfits to create and fill a security vacuum			2
it will be hard for needy @entity4 forces to defend against these groups without strong logistical and financial backing			2
training , advising and assisting the @entity4 military and police forces over the next decade are essential elements for assuring long - term stability in the country and in fending off extremism and terrorism			2
failure to sign the bilateral security agreement will diminish international commitments , lower business confidence and exacerbate an already significant economic crunch in @entity4			2
this does not mean that the @entity4 , including @entity3 , should blindly agree to @entity45 terms			2
@entity3 's frustration to a large part stems from the inability -- perhaps unwillingness -- of @entity45 forces to confront terrorists and extremists who are based in cross-border sanctuaries , with the exception of @entity115 and , lately , outfits like the notorious @entity117			1
the duality apparent in @entity119 between " good " and " bad " @entity57 -- those who are protected as strategic proxies and those they fight -- has increased mistrust between @entity4 and @entity125 , despite @entity125 prime minister @entity127 's recent day - long visit to @entity128			2
@entity3 is traveling to @entity129 and @entity130 in the next few days to have a heart - to - heart with regional heavyweights , some of whom -- like @entity129 - are not too keen on seeing a continued @entity1 presence in the region			2
regional politics aside , the root cause of @entity3 's apparent insecurity lies in @entity4 domestic politics			1
he wants to be kingmaker in next april 's presidential ballot , but also master of the larger endgame that might involve certain @entity57 elements who , in his mind , would agree to a political deal			0
the @entity57 are also cashing in on @entity3 's gamble			1
in an unprecedented move , they issued a statement monday praising his stance on the security agreement and refrained from calling him an " @entity1 puppet " for the first time			0
some have suggested the unlikely but not impossible scenario that @entity3 may exploit the uncertainty to either delay elections or call for a state of emergency and take the country down an unsteady path			0
but @entity3 has indicated that he would not interfere in the electoral process , knowing that would shatter his legacy , leave him stranded and cornered by all sides , with the exception of the armed militants			0
instead , it is more likely that @entity3 's latest risky gambit is more about style than substance ; the subtle touch has never been his strong suit			1
whether these last resort overtures will open any doors to a just and peaceful settlement or help his side with the upcoming elections has yet to be determined , but at least he will be able to make a case that he did not toe the @entity1 line			0
it is a major gamble that could backfire if @entity1 patience runs out or if other regional players increase their pressure through their proxies to put him off guard or disrupt elections			0
complications could also arise if he is courted too warmly by the anti-security agreement circles inside and outside @entity4 , at the detriment of the majority pro-agreement population			0
the @entity1 should spell out its own red lines but be flexible with demands that are not deal - breakers			0
@entity4 have given @entity3 the benefit of doubt for many years , but their leader 's overall record has been patchy at best			1
people are openly advocating reform and are concerned about the rise of entrenched cliques backed by the president that appear intent on holding the country hostage and manipulating the elections in their favor			0
the donor community needs to reassure the @entity4 people in the face of these fears and extend the hand of friendship that has generated @entity4 support for a continued international presence in the country			0
this can be best achieved by continuing to promote democratic governance , assist in the buildup of the @entity4 national forces to help fight terrorism , protect women 's advances and invest in the young and entrepreneurial			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			0

@entity227 : most @entity4 upset at @entity3 's *balking* at deal to let some troops stay on
@entity227 : @entity3 *jockeying* to protect his political , financial interests after his term ends
he says @entity4 worry about security but also want to keep the gains of the past 12 years
@entity227 : @entity4 will deal with @entity3 ; @entity1 must be patient and promote democratic reforms
