-- " we face neither @entity1 nor @entity2 , we face forward			0
" those words were spoken by @entity4 , the man who led the creation of the independent nation of @entity7 out of @entity9 colonization in 1957			2
and over half a century later , they are still inspiring a man who is doing his best to lead a small sporting revolution in his homeland			0
it is no small irony that the focus of his mission so far was the @entity19 -- a competition formerly known as the @entity19 , bringing together nations and dependent territories from around the globe			2
and when @entity25 took to @entity27 's velodrome last week , he became @entity7 's first international track cyclist			1
it was some achievement -- the 23 - year - old had only taken up the sport the previous september , and did not know his best event until march			1
" i had never competed in cycling or track in any kind of level , so it was a big ask , " he tells @entity0 's human to @entity34			1
" it was quite a steep learning curve to start with the aim of competing at the @entity19			2
" i was very excited by it , but also , my common sense told me that , you know , you 've never done this before			0
all the logical things go through your head , ' what are you thinking ? you must be mad			0
' " you know all these things , but i think it 's worked out fantastic and taking that risk has proved worthwhile			2
" to some degree , @entity53 - @entity52 had the benefit of home advantage at the @entity19 -- but it was a long journey			1
born in the town of @entity59 , by the age of five he had moved almost 3,000 miles south to @entity62 with his mother , a midwife , and father -- a pastor			0
" i learned to ride a bike in @entity62 , " he recalls			0
" it 's just something i did recreationally and it 's the quickest way to get from a to b without paying any money , so it was a thumbs - up for me			2
" the family 's wanderlust meant that by 2000 they ended up in @entity75 , the former control center of @entity9 's once - proud global reign , and a year later had settled north of the border in @entity80 -- a country which will hold a referendum on the issue of independence from the @entity9 on september 18			1
" i 've lived in @entity27 for nearly 14 years now , so it 's my home , " @entity52 says			1
" i feel like i 've got a great connection with the @entity80 people			0
" he had been studying sports therapy at university when a chance opportunity arrived that would reconnect him with the land of his birth			0
with the @entity19 heading to @entity80 , a fellow expatriate @entity7 businessman had a plan -- but he needed someone to execute it			1
" in @entity7 , track cycling is not really a sport			1
we 're really big on road and time - trialing , " @entity52 says			1
deep into his studies , he initially decided not to take part			0
but his first trip back to @entity7 in 18 years changed his thinking			2
" it was all new to me and i kind of fell in love with the place again and really enjoyed my seven weeks there , " he says			0
" after i came back to the @entity9 , it made so much sense to actually do something for the @entity7 who i 've got to know and love after my holiday there			2
" so in september 2013 , @entity52 took a year out of university and began the process of trying to catch up with cyclists who 'd been training for more than a decade			1
you have to pass tests just to be allowed to ride on the steep contours of a velodrome			0
" the first time i got on the track , i thought it was very , very easy , " he recalls			0
" then it got harder and harder in terms of bike handling skills and techniques on the track , and i had to repeat my accreditations i think about eight times , so it was slightly embarrassing and one of those moments where you either quit or you fully commit			0
" you need to know what you 're doing in track cycling -- the bikes have fixed gears and the punishment for mistakes can be painful			2
" it 's not like a road bike where you just put on the brakes and you 're safe from any drama , " @entity52 says			1
" i always say to my friends i 've got little pieces of me on the @entity27 velodrome ! " by the end of the year he had decided to keep pursuing his dream			1
" it was kind of do it yourself , go onto the internet , watch @entity157 videos , download journals and read and read and kind of consume as much as possible , " he says			0
" because of my sport background , i had an understanding of how to write training programs and through reading journals about track cycling and just asking the coaches there , i started to write programs			2
" by march , he realized he was not suited to endurance events , so switched to sprints			0
and his hopes were boosted by the support of @entity172 @entity171 , who had won silver at the @entity174 but was now part - time coaching after injuries restricted his riding opportunities			0
" a lot of the local community were very supportive and very inspired by what i was doing , " @entity52 says			2
" i find it quite funny because i never thought i 'd be one of those guys , but they 've been amazing and encouraging and a lot of local businesses in @entity27 have contributed a lot to funding and paying for the track sessions and equipment			1
" @entity7 's cycling federation was in no position to help financially , but supported his bid to make history in @entity27			1
" they really motivated me , gave me advice and assisted me in finally being able to be part of the @entity7 @entity19 team			1
their support and their encouragement has been incredible			0
" he went into the competition not expecting great results -- and that proved to be the case			0
@entity53 - @entity52 was 26th out of 28 in the men 's sprint qualifying ( 12 riders went into the final ) and was last in both his heats in the keirin -- watched in the latter event by his parents , two brothers and younger sister			1
" it was a very good experience to get an idea of what it 's like to compete at the very top , " he says			0
" these guys have been doing it for 20 - plus years and you come in after 10 months in the sport to challenge them -- the audacity of it ! " in terms of performance i did n't do as well as i could have , or i wanted to , but i think the lessons will help for @entity228			1
i 've been encouraged by the other teams here			0
one of the @entity230 came up to me at the end and gave me a jersey , shook my hand and said , ' well done mate			0
' " next he is targeting the @entity228 , both on the track and off it			0
@entity7 had a road cycling team for the first time in @entity27 , sending five riders			1
" we 're a very small nation in terms of cycling and we 're taking it one competition at a time , " @entity52 says			1
his long - term dream is to build a national cycling center in @entity7 , and he has started down that path by setting up the @entity250 foundation to both help children in @entity7 with transport and stimulate their interest in cycling as a sport			1
" cycling as a whole is developing rapidly on the continent of @entity262 , " he says , and cites the example of 2013 @entity258 champion @entity257 , who was born to @entity9 parents in @entity260 and started his racing career in @entity262			0
" i think there should be an eye kept out on these countries because if you look at their development in athletics , it 's going to be similar , " @entity52 says			1
" the only difference is they just need the time , the facilities and the funding to get the talent -- which is tremendous there -- to the platforms where they can compete			0
" and that will hopefully mean he 's not another one - man band on the track at the @entity228			2
" representing @entity7 as the first track cyclist is a tremendous honor , " he says			1
" it 's a privilege for me , who has only been involved in this sport for a very short time , so i hope to do them proud and progress the sport and facilitate @entity7 's long - term involvement in track cycling			1
