editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5			1
his new book , " @entity8 : the @entity9 -- from @entity11 to the @entity12 , " will be published in december by @entity10			0
@entity2 writes widely about current events			2
@entity14 says @entity15 got his @entity16 at the end of a presidency marked by failure			1
@entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity22 ) -- did president @entity23 deserve the @entity16 ? that debate will likely continue for weeks to come			1
but the more interesting question may be about what impact the prize will have on president @entity23 himself and the key decisions he must make about national security			1
the case of @entity15 , the last sitting president to be awarded the prize , offers some useful lessons			1
on december 10 , 1920 , @entity34 , the @entity35 minister to @entity36 , accepted the @entity37 on behalf of president @entity15 , who was being honored for his work in creating the @entity39			1
the president had first been nominated in 1918 , but strong internal disagreement within the committee delayed his receiving the prize			2
it was his actual campaign to gain ratification for the @entity39 agreement in 1919 that persuaded the committee he had earned the recognition			0
@entity34 read a statement from @entity15 , who was in poor health after suffering a stroke , that said : " in accepting the honor of your award , i am moved by the recognition of my sincere and earnest efforts in the cause of peace , but also by the very poignant humility before the vastness of the work still called for by this cause			0
" @entity15 realized that the award came toward the end of a presidency where he had failed to achieve many of his goals			1
there was a certain irony that the prize was awarded right at the time that president @entity15 had failed to persuade the @entity72 to ratify the @entity73 , the agreement signed at the end of @entity11 i. one of the @entity36 newspapers , the @entity78 , ran an editorial that stated : " after disappointment in @entity81 he returned home a beaten man , ridiculed by his adversaries and fellow - citizens			1
by circumstances out of his control he was restrained from promoting his international peace work			0
as @entity89 he was unable to do anything more , but history will keep memory of him as creator of the @entity39			0
" to @entity94 and to great parts of @entity35 president @entity15 looms as the man of peace who broke with the old doctrines and showed the way toward new ideas			1
he is , first and last , the great peace promoter -- popular among the victorious and among those beaten			0
" when @entity15 received the @entity37 , his presidency was one of dashed expectations			2
in addition to the fact that the @entity72 had refused to ratify the @entity73 -- despite a massive campaign by the president to pressure them into doing so -- many other things had been difficult in @entity15 's second term			1
though he had run for reelection in 1916 as a president who would keep the nation out of war , @entity15 led @entity35 troops into a bloody battle			2
although @entity15 had promised fellow progressives that he would not abandon the domestic principles he had embraced in his first term , once the nation was at war , his administration violated civil liberties , imprisoned wartime opponents , and abandoned much of an interest in creating domestic programs that were unrelated to the war			0
and while many peoples of the world had been deeply inspired by president @entity15 's calls for self - determination , he backed off from pursuing those principles in exchange for international support for the @entity39			1
without @entity35 participation , the @entity39 ultimately proved ineffective in preventing war			0
@entity23 is fortunate that his @entity37 comes much earlier in his presidency			2
the @entity140 granted the award to president @entity23 for " his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples			1
" the secretary of the @entity140 stated that @entity23 's achievement has been to shift the international climate toward issues such as diplomacy and negotiation , arms control and disarmament , multilateral institutions , as well as democracy and human rights			1
the good news for president @entity23 is that while he has had a tough few months in office , he still enjoys strong approval ratings in the @entity35 and , as the award indicates , has significant prestige abroad			2
in other words , even after all the town hall meetings and the challenges with his agenda , expectations remain high about what this president can do			0
the president enters a period when he will be making critical decisions that will help shape the " international climate			0
" he will need to decide how strongly to push for climate control legislation , what to do about the requests for more troops in @entity175 , how to handle counterterrorism policy with regard to issues such as the closure of @entity180 , and how to respond to @entity182 's nuclear program			0
as he makes these decisions , this award can serve as a powerful reminder about what his supporters were hoping he could achieve , and as a source of energy to pursue those goals			0
in his speech on friday , @entity23 indicated that he was thinking in these terms			0
he said : " i will accept this award as a call to action -- a call for all nations to confront the challenges of the 21st century			0
" when @entity15 died in 1924 , he understood all too well how devastating dashed expectations could be for a presidency			2
" i am a broken piece of machinery , " he said on his deathbed			0
in @entity15 's case , the @entity37 only amplified the limits of what he had been able to accomplish in the @entity205 and the promises he had broken along the way			1
in president @entity23 's case , the award comes much earlier in his tenure and can serve a very different function , offering a compass to guide him as he makes critical decisions about national security in the weeks ahead			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity14 .			0

@entity14 : the last sitting president to receive @entity140 was @entity15
he says @entity15 's prize came at end of a very troubled presidency
he says @entity23 is being honored at beginning of presidency
@entity2 : @entity226 can serve as a moral compass to guide @entity23 's actions
