you have good manners , right ? after all , you keep your elbows off the table and say " please pass the salt , " right ? but when you head abroad , things get a little more complicated			1
case in point : rest your chopsticks the wrong way , and you might remind a @entity14 friend of their grandmother 's funeral ( rule 2 )			1
but knowing what the etiquette rules are wo n't just save you from some awkward situations , says @entity22 , author of the " @entity24 " series			1
it can also help you make friends			1
" it 's really a statement of your openness and awareness of the fact that the people you 're with ... may in fact see the world differently , " he says			1
" it 's simply going to get you out of the tourist bubble			1
" sound good ? then here are 15 rules to keep in mind			1
@entity44 trips you absolutely love in @entity46 , do n't put food in your mouth with a fork			1
instead , when eating a dish with cooked rice , use your fork only to push food onto your spoon			1
a few exceptions : some northern and northeastern @entity56 dishes are typically eaten with the hands -- you 'll know you 've encountered such a dish if the rice used is glutinous or " sticky "			1
also , stand - alone items that are not part of a rice - based meal may be eaten with a fork			1
but , says @entity64 , a food writer who blogs at @entity65 , the worst thing to do at a traditional , rice - based meal would be to use chopsticks			1
" that is awkward and inconvenient at best and tacky at worst , " she says			1
in @entity14 , never stick your chopsticks upright in your rice			1
between bites , your chopsticks should be placed together right in front of you , parallel to the edge of the table -- and nowhere else , says @entity77 , @entity14 cooking instructor and co-author of " @entity80			1
" ( if there is a chopsticks rest , you use it , putting the tips you 've been eating with on the rest			1
) but sticking them upright in a bowl of rice is even worse : during funerals in @entity14 , the rice bowl of the deceased is placed before their coffin ... with their chopsticks upright in the rice			1
so what would she rather see : someone doing that at a meal , or asking for a fork ? @entity77 does n't hesitate			1
" asking for a fork , " she says			2
@entity101 : 12 elevators you need to see to believe in the @entity107 , @entity104 and parts of @entity106 , do n't eat with your left hand			2
in @entity104 , you should n't even touch the plate with your left hand while eating			2
that 's largely because the left hand is associated with , um , bodily functions , so it 's considered to be dirty			2
in fact , says @entity22 , do n't even pass important documents with your left hand			2
a lefty ? then it 's okay to use your left hand -- as long as you take your right hand out of the game			2
at a traditional feast in @entity121 , it 's rude to sip your wine			2
at what @entity121 call a supra ( traditional feast ) , wine is drunk only at toasts			2
so wait for those ... and then down the whole glass at once			2
on the upside , says @entity121 - based photographer and videographer @entity131 , the glasses tend to be on the small side			2
in @entity135 , never eat tacos with a fork and knife			1
worried about spilling refried beans and salsa all over your front ? tough			2
@entity135 think that eating tacos with a fork and knife looks silly and , worse , snobby -- kind of like eating a burger with silverware			1
so be polite : eat with your hands			2
in @entity150 , only drink a cappuccino before noon			1
some @entity150 say that a late - day cappuccino upsets your stomach , others that it 's a replacement for a meal ( it 's common to have just a cappuccino , or a cappuccino and a croissant , for breakfast )			1
either way , you wo n't see @entity150 ordering one in a caf√© at 3pm -- and certainly not after a big dinner			1
do so , and you 'll be instantly branded a tourist			2
if you need that coffee fix , though , an espresso is fine			2
in @entity169 , always pass the port to the left -- and remember the @entity172			2
it 's unclear why passing port on the left is so important ; some say it has to do with naval tradition ( the port side of a boat is on your left if you 're facing the helm )			2
regardless , passing the decanter to the right is a big gaffe			0
so is not passing it at all			0
if you 're at a meal and the decanter stalls , then ask the person with it , " do you know the @entity172 ? " if they say they do n't know him , reply , " he 's a very good chap , but he always forgets to pass the port			0
" it sounds weird , but it 's true			0
this is such a nationwide tradition , the @entity198 wrote an article on it			0
@entity101 : can you spot the travel rip - off ? in @entity204 , do n't eat your bread as an appetizer before the meal			0
instead , eat it as an accompaniment to your food or , especially , to the cheese course at the end of the meal			0
that said , one thing that would be a faux pas anywhere else -- placing bread directly on the table and not on a plate -- is perfectly acceptable in @entity204 -- in fact , it 's preferred			0
in @entity222 , do n't flip the fish			0
although you might be used to flipping over a whole fish once you 've finished one side , do n't -- at least when you 're in @entity222 , especially southern @entity222 and @entity227			0
that 's because flipping the fish is " dao yue " in @entity222 , a phrase similar to " bad luck			0
" plus , says @entity22 , " to flip the fish over is like saying that the fisherman 's boat is going to capsize			0
" the most superstitious will leave the bottom part untouched , while others will pull off the bone itself to get to the bottom			0
in @entity150 , do n't ask for parmesan for your pizza -- or any other time it 's not explicitly offered			1
putting parmigiano on pizza is seen as a sin , like putting @entity246 on a fine chocolate mousse			0
and many pasta dishes in @entity150 are n't meant for parmesan : in @entity252 , for example , the traditional cheese is pecorino , and that 's what goes on many classic pastas like bucatini all'amatriciana , not parmesan			1
a rule of thumb : if they do n't offer it to you , do n't ask for it			0
do n't eat anything , even fries , with your hands at a meal in @entity266			0
manners here are a little more formal than many other @entity270 countries			0
so while it might be the most practical to just pick up those fries with your fingers , do n't do it			0
" the greater need is to identify with @entity278 culture , so food is [ eaten ] with a knife and a fork , " @entity22 says			0
in @entity285 , if an older person offers you a drink , lift your glass to receive it with both hands			1
doing so is a sign of respect for elders , an important tenet of @entity293 culture			0
after receiving the pour with both hands , you should turn your head away and take a discreet sip , says @entity297 , a @entity293 - born worker 's rights advocate who regularly visits family in @entity285			1
" to this day , if anybody hands me anything , both hands shoot out instinctively , " @entity297 says			0
similarly , do n't start eating until the eldest male has done so ( and do n't leave the table until that person is finished )			0
@entity101 : the 6 most inspiring travel films of the year never mix -- or turn down -- vodka in @entity308			1
the beverage is always drunk neat -- and no , not even with ice			0
adding anything is seen as polluting the drink 's purity ( unless the mixer is beer , which produces a formidable beverage known as yorsh )			1
but there 's another faux pas that 's even worse , says @entity22 : when you 're offered the drink and you turn it down			1
since offering someone a drink is a sign of trust and friendship , it 's a good idea to take it			1
even if it is 9am			0
when drinking coffee with @entity329 in the @entity107 , shake the cup at the end			0
typically , anyone @entity329 -- or @entity329 - related -- will continue to pour you more coffee once you 've finished unless you shake the cup , meaning tilting the cup two or three times , when you hand it back			0
it 's such an important tip , says @entity107 - based freelance correspondent @entity339 , that last year , @entity329 she was eating with in @entity341 made her practice it until she got it right			0
in @entity344 , play your tokens wisely			0
at a churrascaria , or a @entity352 steakhouse , servers circle with cuts of meat and diners use tokens to place an order			0
if a server comes out with something you want , make sure your token , which you 'll have at your table , has the green side up			1
if you do n't want any more , flip it with the red side up			0
since the meat can be never - ending , it 's important to strategize -- if you leave that token green side up you could end up ordering a lot more than you intended			0
