-- if there is anyone who embodies the fighting spirit of @entity6 's disaster - laden year , it is @entity7			1
the 33 - year - old is the captain of @entity6 's women 's soccer team who lifted the @entity11 in @entity12 last june			1
despite being huge underdogs her team made it through to the final of the tournament where they beat the highly fancied @entity19			0
before the competition began the team had little financial backing and was practically ignored by the @entity6 public still reeling from the earthquake , tsunami and nuclear disaster in @entity27			1
so when the @entity6 talk about " ganbaro " ( @entity6 for standing firm in the face of unspeakable odds ) , @entity7 's success is a shining example of how it 's possible			1
" we fought for ourselves and for @entity6 , " says @entity7			1
before the matches at the @entity11 , @entity6 's coach showed the team images of tsunami - devastated towns where nearly 20,000 people perished			1
" it was hard to believe the images were of @entity6			1
i became very sad , even though it was right before our matches			0
the images urged us to move forward as a team and we strongly felt that we had to get to the finals			2
we were very thankful that we could play soccer when there are many people affected by the earthquake , " says @entity7			1
as the team progressed through the competition , the final loomed against the @entity19			0
@entity6 had not managed to beat the @entity19 in 25 previous matches			1
" for some strange reason , i just did n't feel like we could lose , " says @entity7			2
" i 'm not sure why , perhaps a sixth sense			0
it was n't just me either			0
my teammates were also feeling like we could n't lose			0
maybe we felt this way because @entity6 was giving us power			2
" across @entity6 , fans watched in the early morning hours , crying and screaming as their team won against all the odds			1
the fairy tale was n't over for @entity7 , who was recently named @entity11 's female player of the year			1
it was the high point of a career spent toiling in a sport that 's unappreciated in @entity6 and underfunded by sponsors			2
around 25,000 girls play football in @entity6 , but there are no professional leagues for women			2
@entity7 herself played on a boy 's team			1
the pay gap between the genders is stark and most of the members of @entity7 's @entity11 team have full time jobs and could only train in the evenings			1
@entity7 now sees that lack of opportunity as an asset			2
" thinking back now , my technique probably improved because i played with boys and perhaps i became mentally stronger , too , because i did n't want to lose to them , " she says			0
@entity7 emerged as a gifted athlete , making her first international debut at the age of 15			0
she says she believed she would be married by the age of 28 and have children			0
but the dream of being the world 's best player kept her on the pitch			0
that dream has been achieved and @entity7 is now looking ahead to the @entity103 in @entity104			0
she hopes the disparity between men 's and women 's teams in @entity6 will close if her team can bring home a medal			1
" if we can do well at the @entity103 , maybe some players may switch from having to work full - time to part - time			0
" when asked if she feels she is a national symbol , @entity7 laughs and shakes her head			1
" no , no , no. not at all , " she says			0
she acknowledges that her win inspired @entity6 fans and she does offer advice to young girls who want to achieve in sport			0
" it has been a long time since i set the goal of winning the @entity11 and i want to communicate the importance of having a goal , " she said			2
" it 's easy for people to want to see results quickly , but it takes time			0
i 'd encourage them to keep at it			0
