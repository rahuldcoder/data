@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 , one of the oldest civil rights groups in the nation , will announce the successor to chairman @entity8 on saturday as the organization strives to prove its relevance and influence to a new generation			1
@entity3 vice chair @entity13 has emerged as the favorite to fill the seat left by @entity8 , a civil rights leader who has held the post since 1998			1
@entity8 , a stalwart of the civil rights movement , helped found the @entity18 , known for its student sit - ins in the early 1960s , and served as the first president of the @entity21			1
he served in both houses of the @entity23 , totaling two decades in office , before leading the @entity3			1
" i think he 's been enormously effective ; he 's just a thoughtful person with a rich history in civil rights struggles , " said historian @entity25 , whose book , " @entity27 , " chronicled the history of the @entity3			1
@entity25 said @entity8 brought his experiences from the forefront of the civil rights movement to his role as chairman to take on disparities in the criminal justice system , education , housing and unemployment to the national level			1
most recently , amid internal , grass - roots level tensions over whether the @entity3 would support same - sex marriage , @entity8 appeared at the @entity44 in @entity45 in october			1
" i 'm fond of saying there 's no such thing as saying gay rights or black rights			0
there 's civil rights , and every @entity52 deserves civil rights , " he said at the time			1
" he 's very clear on what has long been the @entity3 message of civil rights and inclusive democracy , " @entity25 said			1
@entity8 also is known for some of his political criticism , doling it out consistently against the @entity61 and the @entity63 administration in the earlier years of his tenure			1
at the 2001 @entity3 convention , which was held before the september 11 attacks , @entity8 sharply criticized some of president @entity63 's political appointments , saying @entity63 had " selected nominees from the @entity71 wing of @entity52 politics , appeased the wretched appetites of the extreme right wing and chosen @entity76 officials whose devotion to the @entity78 is nearly canine in its uncritical affection			1
" @entity63 spoke before the @entity3 in 2000 , during his first run for the presidency , but he did not make another appearance until 2006 , during his second term			2
@entity8 has called out @entity85 as well , complaining they are too often " not an opposition ; they 're an amen corner			2
... when one party is shameless , the other party can not afford to be spineless			0
" " @entity8 has been very effective , " said @entity91 , former chairwoman of the @entity92			2
" he came out of a tradition of conflict and advocacy , and has taken on people rather vocally at times			0
" probably , the next person will need to take into account the change in terms of people they 're dealing with			0
" @entity8 , 70 , indicated he was ready to leave the organization in 2008 , but stayed on in 2009 as the @entity3 celebrated its 100th anniversary			1
at the time , there was talk about whether the organization was still relevant in what some observers called a " post-racial " @entity52			1
@entity109 , a linguist and conservative political commentator , spelled it out in a february 2009 column titled , " if the @entity3 ceased to exist tomorrow , would it have a significant effect on black @entity52 ? " for @entity8 , the answer was obvious			1
" we have for the first time a black man who can open the doors to @entity126 , but we now know his children could n't go to a pool in @entity118 , " @entity8 said in july , referring to a decision by a suburban @entity118 , @entity119 , swim club to revoke privileges of a largely minority day care center last year			2
" so , as long as this disparity exists , we 're not the national association for the advancement of one colored person , we want all colored people to advance , " he continued			1
" and for us , people come in all colors -- black , brown , yellow , everything			0
we want everyone to advance , everyone to progress , and until that 's true , the @entity3 is going to be here			2
" to ensure it will be here , the organization has showcased youthful leaders among its ranks , most notably by tapping @entity146 as its president in 2008			0
at 35 , @entity146 was the youngest person to hold the post at the @entity3			2
@entity149 , who now teaches history at the @entity151 , was on the @entity3 search committee at the time			2
" it 's a generational change , " she said friday			0
" the organization is clearly doing what every organization should do			0
they should renew their leadership and reach out to the next generation			0
... otherwise they 'll die			0
" selecting @entity162 -- who made history in february 2001 when she was unanimously elected vice chair of the @entity3 national board of directors at age 35 , making her the youngest and first women to get the job -- as chairwoman will only support that vision , @entity149 said			1
" she 's very different from @entity8			2
but the fact that she 's younger , vibrant , very dynamic -- i think it 's great , " @entity25 said			0
" it 's an important position , and i think having someone like her in that position says something			0
" she added that the @entity3 has managed to stay effective by maintaining its large grass - roots support , with chapters in every corner of the country			2
@entity8 , in his interview last year , said , " what we do has not changed -- we fight racial discrimination			1
but the way in which we do it has changed remarkably			0
" " we need to be more aggressive , we need more members , we need to do more of everything we do right now , " he said			0
" i 've never thought we were the perfect organization			0
i 've always thought we could do better tomorrow than we do today			0
" in his speech on the 100th anniversary of the @entity3 , president @entity192 said " the pain of discrimination is still felt in @entity52 " among african - americans , latinos and @entity199 - @entity52			1
" even as we inherit extraordinary progress that can not be denied , even as we marvel at the courage and determination of so many plain folks , we know that too many barriers still remain , " he said			0
for the @entity3 , that means there is decades of work left to be done .			0
