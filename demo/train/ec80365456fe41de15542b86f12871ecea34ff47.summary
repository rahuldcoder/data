-- between games , practices , travel and promotional appearances , you 'd think that the @entity7 's multimillionaire stars would be too busy			1
but most @entity7 players say they find time to play video games every day			1
in fact , the @entity7 claims that 85 percent of its players are gamers			1
" i would say i play about three or four hours every night , " says @entity14 @entity13			2
" i 'm a night owl , so after games i 'm up till about 4 or 5 a.m. playing video games			1
" " that 's all i do , " says @entity19 forward @entity18			1
" if i 'm not on the court , i got the controller in my hand			1
" " with the schedule we have this year , i do n't get to play as much as i want to , " says @entity24 of the @entity25			2
" but whenever i get some down time i play some @entity29			2
" as the @entity7 playoffs get under way , half the league 's players are done for the season , giving them more free hours to fire up their video game consoles			1
the other half will have extra time off between playoff games , thanks to the league 's stretched - out postseason schedule			1
" i play a little bit , but i played more during the summer , " says @entity42 of the @entity43			2
" this season is so crammed , it 's tough			2
" the league 's rising young stars are n't immune from the thrills of gaming , either			2
@entity55 ( @entity56 ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , made a pit stop while in @entity58 for the 2012 @entity59 to check out the new " @entity60 " game at @entity64 ' @entity63 studio -- the developer behind sports franchises like " @entity67 , " " @entity68 " and the new " @entity69 13			1
" @entity7 fans will have a choice of simulation games next season when " @entity60 " tips off against " @entity75			1
" it 's been a few years now that gamers , and @entity7 players , have had no choice in pro-hoops games ( outside of the arcade game , @entity83 @entity82 )			1
" i 'm excited they brought ' @entity85 ' back , " says @entity18			1
" i have n't talked to anybody yet ( about the cover )			2
i 'm sure i 'll get a call here in a few hours or a few days or so			1
i have n't heard about it , this is my first time			2
" @entity18 was the cover athlete for " @entity92 , " a rebranding of @entity83 ' basketball franchise that was canceled because of horrible community reaction to the glitchy gameplay			1
but he 's still up for being on the cover of the new game			0
" i 'm a ' 2k ' person now , " says @entity99 of the @entity100			1
" i might give ' @entity60 ' a try , but ' @entity102 ' has taken over the basketball scene			1
" although a knee injury to @entity106 sensation @entity105 knocked him out for the season , he 's still playable in " @entity108 " -- and his gameplay has improved thanks to not one , but two player rating upgrades by developer @entity113			0
" i actually do n't know the exact numbers , but i know for a while i was in the 50s , i believe , " @entity105 says			0
" i think @entity118 had me as the 467th best player out of 500 or something like that coming into the season			0
" now that @entity105 has earned a 75 in the game , up from 56 when he was a bench player , he 's not focusing on how high his player rating can go			0
" i 'm not really too worried about that , " he says			1
" i do n't have a set number or goal , but it 's cool to be able to hear about progressing			0
that 's the important thing , is that me and my team continue to improve			0
as long as we 're headed up , i think we 're good to go			0
" @entity106 star @entity131 is happy for his teammate 's player rating upgrade			0
" it 's getting up there , " he says			0
" it should be in the 90s			0
if i have a chance to play ' @entity140 , ' he 's definitely in my starting lineup			0
" but not everyone is crazy about their @entity108 player ratings			0
and yes , they do check out their in - game attributes			0
" i like some of the ratings , but i feel like some of them could be increased a little bit , " says @entity147 forward @entity148			1
" defensively , i think they 've got my grade a little low			0
i think they had one of my teammates , @entity156 , a better perimeter defender than me			0
i was like , ' come on now , that ca n't happen			0
' with time , they 'll probably increase them , so i 'm not too worried about it			2
" @entity147 teammate @entity163 , winner of the @entity7 all - star @entity164 , would also like to see his player ratings in @entity7 ' @entity140 ' improved			1
" when i play ' @entity140 , ' and sometimes i play as myself , i get mad , " he says			0
" it 's like , ' i would have dunked that in the @entity7			1
' it 's a great game , but sometimes they do n't actually make you like you want to be made			0
" @entity163 grew up on sports games like " @entity172 " and " @entity85 " on the @entity173 and now plays " @entity174 " and the " @entity176 " series			2
when it comes to video games , some @entity7 players will try anything			1
" i played everything ... football games , basketball games , baseball games , @entity187 , and all of that , " says @entity182 star @entity181			2
" actually , probably my favorite game to play is ' @entity190			0
' it 's always been fun			0
i 've played it for a long time			0
" so the next time you 're on @entity196 , it may just be an @entity7 all - star in that game world with you .			1
