-- when tragedies occur , such as the one at the @entity3 in @entity4 this week , all @entity1 are deeply affected			2
they include the one in four @entity1 adults who experience mental health problems			1
that 's approximately 60 million @entity1			1
their first reaction is much like that of anyone else : feelings of anger and anguish and wanting to know when such events will ever stop			0
but there 's another , secondary impact to this community if a history of mental illness is suspected			1
tragically , in the case with the @entity3 gunman , mental illness appears to be a factor			1
but in too many cases , people simply assume that it is , no matter how much we caution that it 's best not to attempt to diagnose any medical condition speculatively through the news media			2
unfortunately , stigma surrounds mental illness			1
it 's most associated with a violent stereotype			0
the result has always been fear , prejudice and discrimination toward anyone struggling with a mental health problem			1
the stereotype endures despite the fact that the @entity1 surgeon general has found that the likelihood of violence from people with mental illness is low			1
in fact , " the overall contribution of mental disorders to the total level of violence in society is exceptionally small			1
" despite the impact of the @entity3 tragedy and those of @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 on perceptions , a much greater , different reality exists			2
many thousands of veterans experience post-traumatic stress disorder			2
civilian employees of the military seek help for depression ; teachers live with anxiety disorders			0
students succeed academically while managing bipolar disorder			0
people living with schizophrenia may be psychologists , professors , peer counselors or businesspersons			2
they are all members of their communities			0
in the face of violence , people may simply be unable to fathom how an event could occur other than through mental illness , thought of often in non-medical terms such as " madness " or " insanity			1
" their perceptions also are conditioned by headlines that largely overshadow the greater reality			0
stigma perpetuated by the @entity3 tragedy will be internalized by many people living with mental health problems , causing them to stay silent and withdraw from others			1
this will impede their recovery in many ways			0
@entity97 will remain a major barrier that keeps people reaching out for help when they need it			1
in the wake of such tragedies , some will call for persons with mental health problem to be " screened out " by employers in the hiring process or to deny them security clearances			1
in the first case , the @entity109 provides some protection against discrimination , but it is not always followed or easily enforced			0
with top secret security clearances , just ask any member of the military or government official or contractor about the anxiety they often feel if they need to see a psychiatrist and then needing to disclose it as part of a security clearance application or review			0
many issues need to be addressed in the case of the @entity3 tragedy and the tragedies before it			0
they include what happened -- or did n't happen -- in the military and veterans mental health care systems , particularly when the gunman allegedly sought help from the @entity139			1
was there effective engagement ? the response of law enforcement should also be addressed			0
in theory , had the police both arrested and charged the gunman in past incidents involving a gun or disorderly conduct , he would have been put into the @entity151 database and prohibited from buying a gun , regardless of his mental health status			2
it is also possible that his case might have been handled by a mental health court , leading to supervision and treatment			2
had @entity162 police who responded to the gunman 's 911 call for help in august been trained for crisis intervention and worked with a mobile crisis unit to have him medically evaluated , then perhaps this past week 's horrors could have been averted			0
those are issues that must be pursued			0
but in the haste to respond , let 's not stigmatize or discriminate against the millions of @entity1 who live productively with mental illness and who share the anguish and anger of other @entity1 in response to tragic horrors			1
if stigma wins , things wo n't get better			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0
