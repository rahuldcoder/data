@entity0 -- since 1974 , @entity3 presidents have had a tool to use @entity6 operatives clandestinely -- but with limits			1
the term " presidential finding " is back in the headlines this week because of the situation in @entity12			1
a former counterterrorism official with knowledge of @entity3 - @entity12 policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the @entity6 to conduct operations in support of @entity3 policy in @entity12 , including assessing the opposition and determining their needs			1
here 's a deeper look at prescribed covert activities : what is a presidential finding ? a finding is a subset of a presidential directive , focused on the @entity6			1
according to a @entity33 study in 2007 , presidential directives have been around since the early days of the federal government			2
" presidents , exercising magisterial or executive power not unlike that of a monarch , from time to time have issued directives establishing new policy , decreeing the commencement or cessation of some action or ordaining that notice be given to some declaration , " the study said			0
over the years , there have been various directives created , known by specific names and which have a set purpose			2
the notion of a presidential finding was established in 1974 during the height of a congressional investigation into allegations the @entity6 was illegally spying on @entity3 and was involved in covert programs to assassinate foreign leaders			1
in an effort to reign in the executive branch and the @entity6 , @entity57 passed the the @entity60 to the 1974 @entity61			2
the law prohibits the expenditure of appropriated funds by or on behalf of the @entity6 for intelligence activities " unless and until the president finds that each such operation is important to the national security of the @entity3 and reports , in a timely fashion , a description and scope of such operation to the appropriate committees of @entity57			1
" how is covert activity legally defined ? @entity3 law describes covert activity as any secret action taken by the @entity3 in another country to influence that nation 's political , economic or military situation			2
the involvement of the @entity3 is not intended to be apparent or publicly acknowledged			0
the statute does not include traditional intelligence - gathering overseas ; that is , seeking information within a country and analyzing it for policymakers			0
how specific are presidential findings ? a former senior intelligence official said presidential findings are written in a way that is " general enough to allow flexibility , but specific enough to know legally what you can do			1
" intelligence officers engaged in the secret task will know that what they are doing has been authorized by the @entity99 and determined to be legal			0
a @entity3 official with knowledge of findings said they create a framework for broader actions taken in the future -- actions that would require permission from the @entity99 before being done			0
a former counterterrorism official said the specific activities of @entity6 officers would be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the president			1
who determines what the covert activities will be ? the @entity3 official said it is a " collective decision			1
" the administration determines what the overall policy is and what the goals are , and then turns to the intelligence community for suggestions on how to carry it out			0
as the official put it , " you need to look at all instruments of national power " to carry through a policy			0
the former senior intelligence official said covert action is seeking to change such things as the political future of a country , the attitudes of the populace , and / or the economic conditions within a nation			0
the fact there is a presidential finding indicates there is a " much greater involvement " by the @entity6 in @entity12 , said the official			1
for instance , in the case of the rebels , the former official suggested some of the things the @entity6 operatives are doing on the ground are " finding out who they ( the rebels ) are , what they are doing and what they need " to be successful			1
the official went on to say the officers " might be advising on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter surveillance			0
" is covert action always secret ? whenever the @entity6 is engaged in secret action , the @entity3 wants plausible deniability of the role it may have played -- but as the former senior intelligence official indicated , that is n't always the case			1
for instance , when the @entity6 helped launch the occupation of @entity174 following the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity3 , @entity6 operatives were in the country coordinating activities before there were any @entity3 boots on the ground			1
" things were blowing up , " said the official , making it difficult to deny the agency 's involvement			0
the same could be said of the @entity6 's use of unmanned aircraft to fire missiles at suspected terrorists in the tribal areas of @entity192			2
although the @entity6 and the @entity3 government never acknowledge the attacks , it is one of the worst - kept secrets			2
the drones can be seen and heard , and the damage done is publicly evident			0
but the @entity3 government continues to be mum on the attacks because of @entity192 outrage to them			0
the former intelligence official angrily said the disclosure of the @entity12 covert action " puts people 's lives at risk			0
" " you ca n't do covert action without the @entity3 showing its hand , " said the official , adding that will have a detrimental impact on the @entity3 ' ability to carry out its foreign policy objectives .			0

a " presidential finding " allows certain covert activities
the law is *primarily* focused on the use of the @entity6
findings can be both general and specific
