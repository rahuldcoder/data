@entity0 -- whatever @entity4 and @entity5 leaders may say , it seems clear a majority of the residents of @entity8 were only too happy to abandon @entity9 and join the @entity10			1
the referendum held there on sunday was illegal according to @entity9 constitutional law and took place under duress , following the large - scale incursion of " pro-russian forces " -- and voters did not have the choice to say " no " to severing ties with @entity21			2
but these failings aside , it appears plain that most of @entity8 's population , with the exception of the @entity27 minority and some ethnic @entity9 , was content to return to what it regards as its ancestral home			1
the crucial turnout figures of up to 83 % are suspect and may well be inflated			0
but independent reporting of enthusiastic celebrations suggested the overall outcome genuinely reflected popular wishes -- and was crudely democratic			0
for this reason , it is unwise of @entity4 president @entity38 and his @entity5 counterparts to declare they will " never " recognize the @entity8 result			1
this crisis erupted when anti-russian opposition forces in @entity21 overthrew the country 's democratically - elected president , @entity44			0
this action , too , was illegal under @entity9 's constitutional law and had little support in @entity8			1
but it was swiftly endorsed by @entity50 and in @entity5 capitals			0
now , faced by the @entity54 opposition 's rebound success in @entity8 and a political result he does not like , @entity38 cries foul and refuses to accept the outcome			1
he can not have it both ways			0
in his telephone conversation with @entity38 on sunday , @entity10 president @entity59 quoted the " @entity61 precedent , " a reference to the recognition by the @entity4 and several @entity5 states ( but not @entity10 ) of a 2008 declaration of independence by the provincial assembly in @entity71 , even though @entity61 was then still a part of @entity63			1
the unrepentant @entity10 president 's slightly disingenuous question to @entity38 was : so what 's the difference ? the right of self - determination of peoples is guaranteed under @entity79 of the @entity80			1
in @entity82 ( which became independent in 2011 ) , in @entity83 , in @entity84 and @entity85 and various other @entity87 states , the @entity4 and its allies have upheld and encouraged this principle			2
a similar process is currently underway in @entity90			0
if @entity92 enjoyed a similar freedom , it would quite possibly part company with @entity95			0
the answer given by @entity98 governments when confronted with the " @entity61 precedent " is that each case is different and indeed , unique , and must therefore be treated on its separate merits			2
but this , too , is a slightly spurious argument , akin to the hypothesis which states that my invasion of a country ( @entity107 or @entity108 , for example ) is legally and morally justified , whereas your invasion is not			0
in pragmatic as well as theoretical terms , it is a mistake to make of the assisted , hurried but essentially voluntary secession of @entity8 a major issue of principle on which there can " never " be compromise			2
it will obscure the bigger picture			0
the key challenge for @entity38 and the @entity122 is not the fate of @entity8 per se , but what its destabilising departure implies for the future of @entity9 as a whole and for the wider region			1
the sanctions and other punishments now being prepared for @entity10 in @entity50 and @entity131 should pivot on what @entity132 does or does not do next , most especially in the cities of eastern @entity9 where additional , large ethnic @entity10 populations live but so too do many @entity136 @entity9			1
this pre-emptive policy should also apply to @entity138 ( which has a breakaway , @entity54 region known as @entity140 ) , to the @entity141 , and to @entity142 , where @entity59 might be tempted to intrude again			2
@entity59 was left in a minority of one at the @entity145 at the weekend because @entity79 of the @entity80 also states the following : " all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state			2
" whether @entity59 has absolutely contravened this principle in @entity8 may be open to debate			1
but eastern @entity9 , with its mixed populations , heritage and loyalties , is a different matter altogether -- which even @entity160 , which did not support @entity132 at the @entity80 , understands			0
if an emboldened @entity59 now makes the mistake of thinking he can extend his modern - day form of rolling @entity164 into these areas , he must be knocked back very hard indeed			2
that means going much further , and acting much tougher , than the rather feeble travel and visa bans now being discussed will allow			0
an @entity170 - style sanctions regime blocking energy exports , investment , banking and other mainstream business and commercial activities such as arms sales would be more appropriate			0
so , too , would be direct @entity4 and @entity5 military assistance to @entity21 , as proposed by senator @entity178			0
judging by his behaviour in @entity180 and elsewhere since he first became @entity10 's prime minister in 1999 , @entity59 is a bully with a massive inferiority complex who responds to strength , not weakness			1
when @entity38 stresses that diplomatic solutions can still be found , as he did on sunday , @entity59 reads that as fear			1
you can almost hear the snigger			0
the only way to stop this strutting menace , if he continues to over-reach , is to frighten him right back -- and if necessary , help create the conditions inside @entity10 in which he and his ugly , reactionary regime are brought down			1
read more : ignore @entity98 hypocrisy , @entity59 will do what he wants read more : @entity8 's vote : was it legal ? read more : @entity200 : @entity10 spend billions on @entity5 deals the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

voters in @entity8 *overwhelmingly* back a resolution to leave @entity9 and join @entity10
backlash against the decision in @entity4 , @entity122 , with sanctions , travel bans suggested
@entity204 : @entity38 unwise to declare @entity4 will " never " recognize @entity8 vote
@entity204 says @entity98 needs to frighten @entity59 , to *prevent* him moving in to other regions
