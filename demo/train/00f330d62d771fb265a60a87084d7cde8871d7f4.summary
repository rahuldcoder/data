@entity0 has gone from strength to strength in recent years , adding new routes across @entity4 and @entity5 as well as expanding into @entity6			1
a new multi-billion dollar hub airport in the works in @entity9 means this impressive growth story will soon be given yet another boost			1
but with many ambitious competitors also expanding across the @entity15 and the @entity16 , can the @entity13 aviation vision continue to soar ? @entity17 spoke to the airline 's ceo , @entity18 , to find out			1
below is an edited version of their conversation			0
@entity17 ( @entity24 ) : why do you think there is so much growth coming out of @entity13 ? @entity18 ( @entity0 ) : the airline business is so big and economies are growing in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity4 which is feeding us so we are going to grow			1
@entity24 : when do you get to the point when the market is too saturated as there are also many expanding hubs across the @entity16 and particularly in the @entity37 ? @entity0 : that 's the beauty of the airline business			1
there are about 3.1 billion travelers and by 2030 that will be between seven or eight billion , so there are more coming			2
we are growing at 18 %			0
our friends in the @entity15 are growing at about 10 % to 15 %			0
what is happening is that passengers are floating ( between carriers )			0
so you have the option to go from @entity51 in @entity4 to @entity52 in @entity5 to go via @entity9 , via @entity53 , via @entity54 and so on			1
who will become the winner will be the airline who loves the passengers			0
we are the best airline in @entity4 for the last two years			1
hopefully we will continue that but who knows ? we will work hard			0
it 's a big business and it 's a big market			0
if we are good we can become the winner			0
( having a ) good brand , quality , prices , network , size ; this matters			0
@entity24 : you 're building major infrastructure in @entity9 with a third airport that has a $ 35 billion price tag			1
some say this is grandiosity and that you do n't really need an airport of that size			0
how do you counter these critics ? @entity0 : no , we need it			1
from @entity9 we have to cover the whole of @entity4			1
we have more than 100 destinations coming as a @entity4 carrier			1
we ( also ) cover the whole of the @entity16 , @entity6 , northern @entity6 , @entity83 all through @entity84			2
this means @entity0 becomes a nice feeder from @entity9			1
by 2023 , depending upon ourselves will be ... 120 million ( passengers every year )			0
because of this ... you can make a big investment in the airport			0
( we can ) combine these bigger airports with the passenger capabilities of the @entity0			2
the @entity97 carriers who are feeding the other hubs ( just now ) they will appear in @entity9			2
today they want to fly to @entity9 but because of capacity concerns they are not coming			2
@entity13 is a growing country			0
the cost issue is not a problem because of the volume from @entity0 is already put on the table already .			2

@entity0 expanding into @entity5 , @entity4 and @entity6
new hub airport in @entity9 with first stage set to open in 2017
aviation *industry* set to expand *dramatically* by 2030
