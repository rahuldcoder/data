-- hundreds of young adults are getting a lesson in health insurance from some unusual places : an @entity6 show and slam poetry in @entity8 , a local dj in @entity10 and a bar crawl in @entity12			1
with a little more than five weeks left for open enrollment in the state and federal exchanges , health insurance advocates are working hard to enroll millennials			1
in theory , young people are healthier , and in order to make the law cost - effective , the government needs healthy people to enroll to help pay for the sicker people who will be eligible to buy insurance -- some for the first time , since you can no longer be denied a policy because of pre-existing conditions			2
" there 's broad agreement that if young and healthy people forgo purchasing coverage for whatever reason while those that are older and costlier choose to sign up , then cost will increase for everyone with insurance			2
so , it 's important to have broad participation in the system , " said @entity40 of @entity41			0
organizations and cities across the country are hosting events aimed not only at enrolling young people in the exchanges , but also getting them involved in education and outreach efforts			1
they kicked off the campaign with @entity54 on february 15 and will continue to spread the word until the marketplaces close on march 31			1
so far , only 9 % of those who have bought policies are between the ages of 18 and 25			1
only 16 % of those who have bought policies so far are between the ages of 26 to 34			1
however , january marked a 3 % increase in enrollment among people ages 18 to 34 , according to @entity66 , indicating enrollment growth of 65 % for the age group			1
of those who have enrolled in the exchanges since october 1 , 25 % are between 18 and 34 , the department says			1
@entity72 , vice president of individual business for @entity73 , said in the first four months of the marketplace opening they have seen about a third of their membership among 18 - to 34 - year - olds			1
however , there has been an uptick in young people buying policies -- and indeed , in every age group -- as the end of open enrollment nears			1
two organizations -- @entity87 and @entity88 -- are spearheading these efforts , trying to reach millennials through the get covered campaign that launched in june			1
" we 're thinking outside the box in terms of ways to engage people on the topic , " said @entity92 , executive director of @entity88			1
they are also teaming up with the @entity100 and the @entity101 to reach out to young adult artists and the homeless , who are likely to be uninsured			2
they go door - to - door and provide educational materials , collect " commit cards " from interested consumers and have navigators enroll people in insurance plans			0
outreach has expanded to the digital sphere as well through @entity114 , memes and mobile apps			0
to get young adults on board , they have attempted to focus on issues salient to that age group , a primary one being cost			1
to combat the idea that insurance is too expensive , @entity87 provides a get covered calculator that allows consumers to get estimates for how much insurance will cost them			2
the @entity66 reports that of the nearly 3.3 million people who have enrolled since october 1 , 82 % are eligible to receive financial assistance for their insurance plans			1
these groups have partnered with community colleges and public libraries , reached out to young parents through @entity139 associations , and are doing small business outreach -- especially to restaurant workers			2
@entity142 , @entity87 's national youth engagement director , said they have worked with restaurant owners and managers to educate employees about new insurance options and to increase access to this highly uninsured group			2
another message that has resonated among college students , in particular , is the fact that health insurance must cover things like mental health treatments and preventive care , @entity142 said			0
@entity159 's state exchange has aided the " @entity160 " campaign by working with celebrities -- @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 to name a few -- to educate their fans through social media			0
in @entity8 , @entity170 's student club @entity169 organized 30 students to host an on - campus event saturday , partnered with @entity173			0
the event hosted 30 navigators to provide one - on - one support and assist community members with the enrollment process			0
@entity179 , assistant principal at @entity170 , said students were really excited about getting involved with the cause			0
some eligible students even set up appointments and completed applications			0
" they 've heard about the @entity185 , but they do n't really know what it is			0
we know that financial literacy is one of the biggest hurdles the act is facing			0
it 's been good because they 're learning these financial and healthcare literacy tools and having some fun , " @entity179 said			0
according to @entity87 , on saturday alone , # @entity197 was tweeted almost 6,000 times , potentially reaching as many as 225 million users			2
this online attention helped direct young people to the more than 125 events they hosted with their 70 partners			2
nearly 100 people attended a @entity206 enrollment fair hosted by @entity66 , @entity207 and @entity88			1
on site , 69 people created accounts and 40 successfully completed applications			0
several hundred people attended " @entity214 " -- a @entity88 event co-sponsored by @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 , among others			2
the event was live - broadcast and featured food trucks , free @entity221 exercises in the park and autograph signings with two @entity225 players			0
" the idea was to provide information about health coverage in a fun atmosphere that encouraged young people to come by , stay , and hang out , " said @entity226 , @entity88 ' national organizing and programs manager			1
even prior to the launch of open enrollment on october 1 , youth were identified as a group critical to the success of the health insurance exchanges			1
the fact that young adults traditionally have not enrolled in health insurance makes this an uphill battle , said @entity243 , president of the @entity244 , a center - right policy institute			1
" if the reason people are n't insured is ignorance , then outreach efforts will make a difference and the education will be helpful			0
but if the issues are what it costs and the incomes they have , then you ca n't change those fundamentals and it wo n't work , " @entity243 said			0
however , organizers remain optimistic			0
" hopefully we have some positive momentum here that we can build on , " @entity92 said .			0

about five weeks remain for open enrollment in the health exchanges
hundreds of events were held for @entity54 february 15
@entity87 and @entity88 use unique ways to reach young adults
