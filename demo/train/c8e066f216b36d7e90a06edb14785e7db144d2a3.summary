-- as @entity2 , general @entity1 is the top - ranking officer in the @entity4 armed forces , the most powerful fighting machine the world has ever known			2
the @entity8 - @entity4 general married his high - school sweetheart , @entity9			1
they have three children , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
we even know the names of their sons - and daughter - in - law , as well as those of their grandchildren			2
i have no need to know these personal details , but it 's a great comfort that the @entity4 military feels it should make them freely available			0
it 's part and parcel of the transparency and accountability that maintains trust in an open society			0
this trust is never absolute , and often betrayed			0
but there are peaceful mechanisms to question it , to tear it down and to restore it			0
as part of the triumvirate running the @entity43 up until his retirement in 2012 , general @entity40 was of a comparable level of seniority to @entity1			0
but all we know of him from official biographies is the dry details of his rise through the ranks			0
when he became the latest " tiger " caught in president @entity57 's anti-corruption campaign last month , we were suddenly confronted with stories about his family 's role in the sordid graft -- including a multimillion - dollar pre-paid debit card given to his daughter as a gift			1
she was arrested , along with her mother , according to media reports			0
such high - profile cases are designed to lend credence to @entity57 's vow to root out corruption at all levels , taking down the tigers as well as the flies			1
his biggest scalp to date : former @entity78 member @entity77			1
officials are reported to have seized at least $ 14.5 billion from his family , friends and associates			1
but the cases also highlight a fundamental flaw in @entity39 's political system : the state - sponsored veil of secrecy that shrouds the links between power and wealth , links that typically begin with the family			1
these ties are a problem for societies everywhere			2
@entity96 in august exposed how @entity97 , the daughter of @entity99 's president , built a $ 3 billion fortune on ties to her father			1
@entity104 leader @entity103 is embroiled in a corruption scandal involving his son			1
in @entity39 , this matters more			1
for a start , the success of its increasingly global economy acts as a potent advertisement for the @entity114 's political model			2
@entity116 's paranoid control of information about its leaders and their families is coupled with a massive state apparatus dedicated to repressing a free press that could otherwise be relied on to expose those ties			1
former @entity39 premier @entity123 talked often of the need to " govern in the sunshine , " only for his family 's corruption to be exposed in the @entity128 in 2012			1
earlier that year , the wealth @entity57 's family had amassed was documented by a team of @entity133 journalists -- of which i was one			0
both organizations continue to suffer well - reported repercussions from digging around in the forbidden zone that surrounds the ruling elite and their families			1
while @entity143 's kids are photographed strolling along @entity39 's @entity144 , @entity57 's daughter , @entity141 , studied under a pseudonym at @entity146			2
there were unconfirmed whispers of an internship at a @entity151 bank			0
this kind of information matters far beyond the tittle - tattle of society pages in newspapers			0
without knowing the ties binding wealth to power , it 's impossible to truly understand the motives that guide policy and the deployment of capital			2
when @entity167 leader @entity166 last year purged and executed his uncle , @entity168 , the official account included charges of corruption			0
yet there were few commentators who saw anything but a campaign to remove a political opponent			0
for sure , @entity167 is a grotesque and bankrupt mutation of @entity39 's political model , but at a fundamental level they remain alarmingly alike			1
why should we be willing to accept @entity57 's rationale for the ongoing purges in @entity39 , and so hasty to reject @entity166 's ? in truth , we ca n't and should n't believe either regime			1
there is one simple way for @entity57 to prove without doubt that he 's the real deal : publish the family trees of the @entity78 on the @entity114 website and introduce a public register of interests for all officials so that they can truly be under the supervision of the people			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

latest @entity39 corruption scandal : $ 14.5 billion seized from people around *ex-security* chief @entity77
@entity198 : these high - profile cases do n't get to the heart of the problem
fundamental flaw in the political system : a state - sponsored veil of secrecy that covers the links between power and wealth , typically within families
