@entity0 , @entity1 -- from going to the moon to the explosion of the civil rights movement , the swinging 1960s was an era of conquering new heights and sweeping change			1
so when @entity11 had to return back home to @entity1 in 1966 , after completing his studies in @entity14 , the young engineer thought it was also time for him to blaze new trails			2
an adventure seeker , @entity17 decided to embark on a journey that was destined to change the course of his life			2
" the @entity24 was the largest desert in the world and very active -- so i decided to explore it , " says @entity11 , who was 27 at the time			1
unfazed by the challenge , he drove home all alone by way of the desert -- from the @entity31 , and ultimately through the vast , unforgiving sands of the @entity24 , to @entity1			1
" driving from @entity36 all the way across the @entity24 , you must be ready to die , " says @entity11 , who has since traveled across the world 's largest desert twice more			1
" you have to tell yourself , ' look , it is possible i will die in the process , ' and you must be ready for it because it 's only when you 're ready for that and you 're confronted with death -- and i was confronted with death a number of times -- that you are able to deal with it			0
" but if you 're not ready to die and you 're confronted with death , you panic and once you panic you lose focus and once you lose focus your life goes with it			0
" during his first solo expedition , @entity11 was no stranger to near - death situations			0
he remembers negotiating for his life with bandits and having his possessions stolen ; he recalls the intense loneliness of the epic journey and struggling through the desert without access to clean water			0
yet despite all the difficulties , @entity11 says the beauty of the desert made it all worthwhile			0
" you wake up in the morning at about 5 o'clock ... and then you watch the sun rise and this extremely peaceful and serene atmosphere and then you just look at the sun coming like a ball of fire , rising from the sand and then coming up , " recalls @entity11			0
" at that time the temperature is close to zero in the desert , in the @entity24 , so you can imagine a combination of that temperature and then looking up and watching this ball of fire coming out of the sand and creating a kind of scenery that you can not find anywhere else in the world			1
" but apart from discovering the majesty of the @entity24 , @entity17 also witnessed how drought , deforestation and human intervention were turning fertile land into desert and condemning people to acute poverty			1
in 1999 , after his second solo expedition across the @entity24 , he realized he had to do something to help the people affected by desertification			1
" i saw what is now known as the desertification , the encroachment of the desert , " he remembers			2
" i saw the fact that it was depriving people of their farmland , i saw that it was also affecting water supply ; in some areas of the desert they do n't have rainfall for about six - eight years , so i saw a completely different life and that was what led me into starting some kind of advocacy that will bring this whole thing to the global arena			0
" since then , @entity17 has dedicated his life to curbing the scourge of poverty caused by the desertification			1
now a prominent environmentalist , he started giving lectures , speaking at summits and visiting other deserts around the world -- from the @entity124 in @entity125 and the @entity126 in @entity127 , to @entity128 and @entity129 -- to study how people across the world had succeeded in taming the desert and dealing with drought and famine			1
@entity17 's desire to take more direct action against the problem also prompted him to launch the @entity138 ( @entity139 ) initiative and set up a pilot project in the desert area of northern @entity1			1
" the fade issue became a topical one because people were now able to see that you can actually recover land from the desert by doing some , what we call , land reclamation arrangement , " says @entity11 , who also runs a museum in central @entity0			0
@entity11 realized early on that combating the encroachment of the desert is a process that takes decades and requires collaboration , so he teamed up with @entity1 officials and started working with schools and universities to create a long - term effort			2
and in 2008 , aged 70 , embarked on his third and last expedition across the @entity24			2
this time he traveled with a group of scientists and environmentalists -- a means of passing on the torch to the younger generation , a process he enthusiastically continues to this day			0
he adds : " i am in the process of putting together a formidable team ... of young men and women that can take over this crusade , that can take over this whole initiative and carry it to the next generation , that is my primary hope			0
