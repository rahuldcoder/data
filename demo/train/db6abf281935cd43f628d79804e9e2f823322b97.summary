-- @entity1 has accepted his punishment after being disqualified from the @entity3 for an incident during thursday 's opening round of the @entity7 golf event			1
television replays showed that the three - time major winner inadvertently moved his ball with his hand on the green at the seventh hole , but did not sign for the required two - stroke penalty			1
the @entity15 went on to card a seven - under - par 65 which left him one shot off the lead , but he did not tee off for friday 's second round after officials noticed his infringement			1
" i was aware i hit the ball picking up my coin			2
i looked down at the time and was pretty sure it had just oscillated and had not moved , so i continued on , " the world no. 26 told the @entity7 website			1
" in slow motion it 's pretty clear the ball has moved three dimples forward and it 's come back maybe a dimple and a half			1
at the end of the day that 's good enough , but i would n't have done anything differently yesterday -- there was nothing i could do about it at that moment in time			2
" the @entity7 's senior referee @entity38 explained that @entity1 was disqualified after signing for an incorrect score			1
" it 's a minute movement , but it 's a movement and he never replaced it , so he should have included a two - stroke penalty			1
because he signed for a score lower than actually taken , the penalty is disqualification , " @entity38 said			0
@entity1 , who has not won on the @entity7 since his second @entity49 @entity48 victory and subsequent @entity51 triumph in 2008 , said he had no quarrels with the officials			1
" the one thing all golfers love about their sport is the fact that we can stand up and say , ' we have the best rules , we are the fairest , we call them on ourselves			0
' " i think in this situation and other situations like that , with the new technology , maybe going forward , that the penalties can be changed			0
but the actual rulings have to stay where they are			0
" meanwhile , defending champion @entity67 claimed a three - shot lead on friday after shooting 65 to move up to 12 - under 132 at the halfway stage			1
the @entity71 winner -- also the 2008 victor in @entity72 -- carded a flawless seven - birdie second round , five of them coming in his first seven holes			0
the @entity78 , playing his first tournament of 2011 , will replace @entity79 as world no. 2 if he finishes in the top seven			0
first - round leader @entity82 was second after a 71 , as the @entity83 dropped three shots in five holes in the middle of his front nine and made two more bogeys after the turn before finishing with a birdie			0
in - form @entity82 holds early @entity72 lead that left last weekend 's @entity48 winner a shot clear of @entity95 champion @entity94 , who countered three bogeys with five birdies in his 70			1
world no. 12 @entity98 was tied for seventh on 138 after a 67 , while former @entity103 @entity102 captain @entity101 was another shot back in a group of eight after a 69			0
world no. 4 @entity106 ( 70 ) was tied for 25th on 141 along with @entity83 's two - time major winner @entity107 ( 71 )			2
world no. 8 @entity108 , the winner here in 2007 and 2009 , was tied for 50th after a 70 , while top - ranked fellow @entity113 @entity112 may also scrape into the weekend rounds after a 75 left him tied for 62nd on 144 -- a shot inside the projected cut			0
@entity112 suffered two double - bogeys on his front nine , but bounced back with birdies at two of his last three holes			0
last year 's runner - up @entity121 and @entity123 were both set to miss out on 145			2
meanwhile , @entity126 rookie @entity125 claimed a share of the lead at the @entity130 's @entity129 after shooting five - under 67 in @entity131 on thursday			1
the 26 - year - old carded eight birdies but closed with his third bogey at the @entity136 's @entity135 in @entity137			2
the first man from his country to play on the main @entity141 circuit , he had been second overnight following his 64 at the @entity142			0
@entity141 @entity143 carded 66 at the @entity135 to join him on 13 - under 131 , with fellow @entity141 @entity144 ( 66 ) and @entity145 ( 65 ) tied for third another shot back			0
