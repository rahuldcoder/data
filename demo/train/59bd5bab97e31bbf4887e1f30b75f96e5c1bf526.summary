@entity11 , whose daughter @entity12 died in the terror attack , saw @entity3 a week ago in @entity14 , he said tuesday			1
he also criticized @entity16 senators who tried to hold hearings this summer into questions surrounding the release of @entity3			2

" at three months , just over half [ of people with his cancer ] would be dead , " @entity11 said			1

@entity3 was appealing his conviction when he was freed on compassionate grounds in august 2009 and then dropped the appeal			1
@entity11 thinks @entity3 feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal , since it leaves him with no way to clear his name or for those -- like @entity63 -- who think he is innocent to have the case reviewed			1
but @entity3 's death could change the legal playing field , @entity11 speculated			1
" if he were to die , the the situation would change , " and @entity63 might be able to get the case reopened , he said			2

" @entity94 sens. @entity93 and @entity95 noted that @entity3 was only given three months to live when he was released but is still alive			2
@entity93 noted that on august 20 , 2009 , @entity3 stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in @entity14			0
" a mass murderer tasted freedom , experiencing joy , " @entity93 said			0
" it was a scene that made the stomach turn ... that made old wounds fresh again in the hearts of those whose family members died at the hands of that man			0
" @entity95 said , " it is the families of those victims who deserve compassion , not this terrorist			0
" " @entity3 ... is very much free , living in the lap of luxury by all accounts , " @entity93 said			0
