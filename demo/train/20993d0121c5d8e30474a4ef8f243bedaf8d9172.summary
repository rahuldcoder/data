@entity0 , @entity1 -- the polls are tight , the ads are flooding the airwaves , the harsh rhetoric is rising , and the surrogates are stumping hard all over the state			2
there is one " x-factor " that will put one of the @entity13 candidates over the top : good , old - fashioned door - knocking -- except , it 's not old - fashion anymore			1
political door knocking is now a data - driven operation , making it as critical a piece of high tech campaign strategies as the endless fundraising solicitations delivered daily to supporters ' inboxes			1
canvassers only go to targeted households identified by algorithms using early voting / absentee voting data , party registration , voting history , and other micro-targeting information that create a stronger profile of a person or household 's likelihood to vote for their own candidates			1
the practice could be the major deciding factor here in one of the country 's closest @entity13 races and whether it goes to @entity44 congressman @entity43 or @entity45 state sen. @entity45 , and whether @entity44 can maintain control the @entity13 itself			1
but these volunteers are n't just trying to get voters for @entity49			0
they want to build their lead with early voting before polls open on tuesday			0
" the big advantage for the party , from the party 's perspective , is we do n't have to employ resources on the day of -- on @entity49 -- to get out the vote because we know you 've already voted			2
and you wo n't get any calls either , " democrat @entity61 explained to a voter who called himself " a @entity43 guy " while canvassing a quiet @entity0 neighborhood			0
@entity1 @entity44 traditionally dominate this area , giving them a significant lead			1
@entity69 say this year they have the competitive edge			2
in 2012,65,000 more registered @entity44 voted absentee than registered @entity69			1
on @entity49 , @entity69 out - voted democrats by over 20,000 , but it was n't enough to stop the @entity1 from giving president @entity74 an important win during his reelection bid			1
recognizing how detrimental this and other statewide losses were , local campaigns , the state party , and national republicans combined efforts , including employing a smartphone app called " advantage " to increase accuracy and productivity of door knocking this year			1
" it 's a much more efficient , much more personal way for people to connect with their neighbors and get the vote out , " @entity1 communications director @entity86 told @entity2			1
" in years past the early voting especially was a huge @entity44 advantage ; we realized we needed to do something to help catch up			2
" @entity69 volunteers walk in groups of two or three , with one person solely dedicated to updating the app and directing the others towards houses with information on who lives there , biographical data and voting status			1
if the person is home and a conversation is had ( so far , no technology to improve that ) , they immediately update the app based on the talk that 's transmitted to the party in real time , who can change their models and update their current map of houses before they even knock on the next door			2
@entity44 use similar data to target voters but still use clipboards , known as " turf packs " to write down responses and input them later into a computer			1
both campaigns say their strategies are fueling their eventual win			0
@entity44 insist that instead of focusing on getting out their base who votes consistently , they are trying to turnout " sporadic " voters , or people who do n't normally vote in a midterm election			2
" our strategy this year is to expand the electorate			0
for us that means turning out non-traditional voters , " said @entity136 , communications director of the @entity137			0
" we right now are leading with these nontraditional voters by 14,000 votes			0
these 14,000 extra votes ... represent over 1 % of the expected final electorate			0
" @entity69 disagree , saying their share of absentee voters have grown , while the @entity44 ' share is shrinking			1
they maintain @entity44 have more unreturned ballots than @entity69			1
" we 're seeing success like never before			0
democrats are usually up by tens of thousands of votes , " @entity86 said			0
he pointed to the over 15,000 absentee vote advantage they had in 2010 , " which we all know was a good year for @entity69 ... democrats simply are n't getting those numbers this time around			1
" every day , the @entity1 secretary of state publicly releases data with absentee voting numbers			2
the campaigns , and other entities that have requested them , receive more detailed reports with names , voter @entity164 numbers , and voting status ( those who have requested ballots and returned them , as well as those who have voted early )			0
the campaigns then crunch this data and update their models to target potential voters			2
this filters through to turf reports and app , arming canvassers with the best intelligence available			0
over 345,000 absentee votes have been cast so far in this election , according to the @entity1 secretary of state 's office			1
that 's about 50,000 more than this point of the 2010 midterm elections			2
the candidates are doing their part in a more traditional way , encouraging their supporters at every stop to take part			0
i need you to go out and vote , i need you to call a friend , i need you to talk to a neighbor and tell them why you 're supporting me in this election and make sure they get out and vote , " @entity45 told supporters in @entity194 , echoing the same message from her previous stops			0
" i ca n't do it alone			0
" both clearly understand the data and how to apply it effectively			0
" we need you to keep knocking on doors , get those absentee ballots returned , " @entity43 implored volunteers in @entity208			1
" i 'm counting on you to get across the finish line			0

door - knocking is still playing a role in the campaign for @entity1 's open @entity13 seat
canvassers are using algorithms to target voters likely to vote for their candidates
to track voter data , @entity44 canvassers use clipboards while @entity69 have turned to a phone app
50,000 more absentee ballots have been cast so far this year than at this point in 2010
