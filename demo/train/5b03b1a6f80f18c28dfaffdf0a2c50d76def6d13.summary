@entity0 -- a federal lawsuit accusing @entity3 of assault and sexual battery on two massage therapists includes lurid details of one of the alleged incidents			1
@entity3 's lawyer soundly rejected the claims of both plaintiffs and called the claims of the first plaintiff " complete fiction			1
" in the first incident , @entity3 allegedly groped a male massage therapist repeatedly and finally masturbated himself during the two - hour session in a bungalow at the @entity20 on january 16 , 2012 , according to court documents filed last friday			1
the first plaintiff , a @entity24 native who is unidentified in the court documents , " suffered severe emotional distress , " the lawsuit claims			2
the lawsuit is asking for $ 2 million in damages			0

" none of the events claimed in the suit ever occurred			1
" a second male therapist , who was allegedly sexually assaulted by @entity3 at an @entity38 hotel on january 25 , was added to the lawsuit tuesday			1
" this second ' anonymous ' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one , " said @entity3 lawyer @entity39 on tuesday afternoon			1
the @entity3 statement questions why the first plaintiff is identified only as " @entity44 " in the court filing			1
" the plaintiff , who refuses to give their name , knows that the suit is a baseless lie , " the statement said			2

@entity39 said it is " easily provable " that @entity3 was not in @entity73 on the day the first incident allegedly happened " since @entity3 was on the @entity75 working on a movie on the date that anonymous ' @entity79 ' claims he interacted with our client			1
" @entity57 said he was in discussions with @entity3 's lawyer for weeks before filing the suit last week and was never told this			1

@entity3 and his lawyer " already conceded he was in @entity0 on january 16 , and we can prove it , " @entity57 said			1
@entity39 said it was " obvious " that @entity57 " checked media reports that my client was in @entity38 working on a movie " before filing the second claim about an incident at an @entity38 hotel			0
" however , the claim by @entity106 is just as fabricated as the claim by @entity108 , " @entity39 said			0

i will find new friends , " the suit said			0
