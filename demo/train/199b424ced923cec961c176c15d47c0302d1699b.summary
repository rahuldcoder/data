@entity1 name - checked @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 on monday while telling @entity5 graduates that " young people and newcomers are often the great discoverers			1
" the former @entity12 @entity11 governor 's commencement speech -- short , optimistic and apolitical -- came the day after he 'd said he planned to release 250,000 emails from his days in office			1
he will also write an accompanying @entity15 that he 'll release next year			0
@entity1 's preemptive approach is one of the clearest signs yet of how seriously he is considering a run for president and allows him to address potential areas of criticism before opposition researchers dig in			1
on monday , @entity1 made no references to his own political future , but did sound a number of optimistic notes -- and he told the new graduates not to fear failure			1
he said graduates should n't " be afraid to shake things up , " and that they should embrace a rapidly changing economy even when doing so is daunting			1
" @entity33 feels that way -- you 're not alone			0
and in many ways , that 's ok			2
because that anxiety can be positive , " he said			0
" when you 're thrown into new situations , you do n't just challenge yourself			2
you see things that other people might not see			2
" the point of his speech , @entity1 said , was to tell graduates to " dream big , do n't be afraid of change and find joy everywhere you can			1
" and they should n't see their ages as impediments , he said			2
" @entity2 was 29 when he developed the theory of natural selection			0
@entity3 was 26 when he developed the theory of relativity			0
and @entity4 , for crying out loud , was 19 years old when he developed @entity58 , " @entity1 said			1
they did n't have assumptions about things			1
they just wanted to have an impact , " he said			0
" and that 's what happens when you 're a newcomer -- you make an impact			0
" @entity1 said he 'd asked his mother , former first lady @entity70 , for advice on what to say			1
her response : " @entity1 , speak about 10 minutes and then sit down and shut up			2
" and he did -- tapping his watch as he sat down , as if to note that he 'd landed almost exactly on the 10 - minute mark			0
he also made reference to his father , president @entity77 , telling graduates they should try to match the 90 - year - old 's zeal for life -- from wearing colorful socks to parachuting out of airplanes to " judging cheerleader competitions for the @entity85 -- i think that 's on his highlight reel for sure			0
" " no matter how many challenges you face , no matter how old you get , remember to have fun in life			0
be like my dad , who turned 90 years old this year , and here 's a guy who 's lived a full , active life , he was shot out of the sky in @entity99 , he built a business , he served a generation of time in many different positions in public service , and he 's had some incredibly painful losses in his life , but he has never stopped having fun , " @entity1 said			1
" that 's why he 's my favorite person in the world of all time , and i suspect it 's why many others respect and admire him as well			0
