@entity0 , @entity1 -- the defense and prosecution agree on this much : @entity5 pushed her husband of eight days , and he fell off a cliff to his death in @entity10 in @entity1			1
the question for jurors will be whether @entity5 's act was murder or a case of self - defense that ended tragically			1
the two sides set out their opening arguments monday about what took place as @entity5 's trial began in @entity22 in @entity0 , @entity1			2
prosecutors said they would show that @entity5 , 21 , was having serious second thoughts about her marriage before her husband 's death and willfully lied to police after it			1
but her defense lawyers said that the death plunge was an accident resulting from an argument			2
@entity5 initially lied to police , they said , because she was afraid she would n't be allowed to explain what happened on the cliff edge			0
her husband , @entity39 , disappeared july 7			0
four days later , the @entity40 says , @entity5 led friends and relatives to a popular spot in the park , where they found @entity39 's body			1
the young bride at first maintained that she had simply speculated @entity39 , 25 , might have gone there			0
but an @entity40 agent said that she changed her story when she was shown a surveillance photo of the couple entering the park together			0
did @entity1 newlywed blindfold husband before pushing him off cliff ? what exactly @entity5 said next to the @entity40 will be fiercely contested at the trial			2
at a pretrial hearing november 15 , @entity5 testified , " we went on a little stump part and we were in the middle of an argument and he thought i was going to run away			0
@entity39 had grabbed me and i thought he was going to push me down			0
my first instinct was to get him off			0
" in a court filing , the defense said @entity5 pushed @entity39 away as she removed his hand from her arm , and her husband tumbled over the cliff			1
but the criminal complaint against her says that in an @entity40 interview , " @entity5 stated she could have just walked away , but due to her anger , she pushed @entity39 with both hands in the back and as a result , he fell face first off the cliff			1
" her attorney , federal public defender @entity83 , has said the @entity40 did not record the first hour and 20 minutes of @entity5 's interrogation			0
he accused an @entity40 agent of then making " an epic effort " to get @entity5 to use " key words " in a recorded session that would support a criminal conviction			0
a defense motion says that in two subsequent recorded @entity40 interviews , @entity5 said she acted in self - defense and that her husband 's fall was an accident			1
@entity5 , who had been a part - time nanny , is accused of murder and making false statements			2
in court on monday , prosecutors said they would draw on text messages that they say show @entity5 was unhappy in her marriage and testimony that tracks the formation of her actions to deceive police , including sending herself e-mails from a fake e-mail address			1
the prosecution 's evidence will " give you a window into @entity117 's mental state , " said @entity112 for the @entity113			0
speaking for the defense , @entity120 portrayed @entity5 as young , naive and socially inept , somebody whose own family describes her as withdrawn			0
she wove a web of lies to police to " run from the reality of the situation -- instinctively , like a frightened rabbit , " @entity120 said			0
@entity5 was scared that no one would let her explain what happened , he said , because everyone loved @entity39 but no one liked her			2
@entity120 said @entity5 admits a degree of responsibility in her husband 's death , which he described as the result of an " argument - grab - push - fall			1
" but she is not guilty of first - or second - degree murder , he said			0
the first prosecution witnesses in the case testified that @entity5 seemed unhappy in her marriage to @entity39			1
the court also heard text messages that @entity5 sent around the time of @entity39 's death that showed her panic and then her efforts to hide what had happened			1
@entity158 , @entity5 's best friend and matron of honor at her wedding , said @entity5 had expressed regret just days after marrying @entity39			1
" i should be happy and i 'm just not , " @entity5 wrote in a july 1 text message to @entity158			0
in texts on july 5 and 6 , @entity5 alluded to possible aggression by @entity39 , telling @entity158 that he had a temper			2
@entity5 told @entity158 that she would talk to @entity39 about her concerns on july 7 , the day of his death			1
" if you do n't hear from me at all again tonight , something happened , " she said in text message			0
that night , after @entity39 had plunged to his death , @entity5 sent @entity158 several panicked texts , saying she was " freaking out			1
" @entity173 , a friend of @entity39 , testified that @entity5 had lied to her in text messages the day after @entity39 's death			1
in one text , @entity5 asked @entity177 if she 'd heard from @entity39 " last night or today ? " " the last thing he said to me was that he was going for a drive with some friends that were visiting , " @entity5 tells @entity177			2
the case is being prosecuted in federal court before @entity185 district judge @entity184 because the incident occurred in a national park			2
woman pleads not guilty @entity2 's @entity189 reported from @entity0 , and @entity190 reported and wrote from @entity191 .			0
