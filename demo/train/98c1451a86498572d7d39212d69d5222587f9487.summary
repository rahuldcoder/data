-- occupy activists and law enforcement authorities found themselves at odds in several @entity5 cities over the weekend , including yet another tense showdown late sunday afternoon in @entity7 , @entity8			1
police in riot gear and holding batons lined up for hours along a city street , face - to - face with activists who refused to clear the road and go onto the sidewalk			1
this confrontation came hours after @entity7 police sgt. @entity18 said more than a dozen people were arrested as authorities cleared @entity22 , the last city park where protesters had gathered			1
@entity25 said the officers were in riot gear as a precaution , and were joined by other assisting agencies			1
" we needed the manpower because we used up a lot of resources yesterday ( saturday ) , " he said			0
mayor @entity35 said late sunday afternoon that " a series of increased drug overdoses ... an arsonist that used the camp as camouflage and almost a 20 % increase in crime surrounding the encampment " prompted the move			1
" all of us are working really hard at keeping the peace and protecting freedom of expression , " @entity35 told @entity0			0
" i support a lot of what the encampment stands for ... ( but ) it should n't be focused on port - a - potties and tents and encampments attracting criminal elements			0
i think this movement needs to evolve			0
" @entity56 , one of the activists , told @entity0 that she was " extremely disappointed that the mayor chose to crack down on these parks when the outpouring of support ( among area residents ) has been so strong			1
" " homeless people exist , drug addicts exist , mentally ill people exist			0
we were a safe place they could go , and that created some problems , " she said			0
" and we were working to deal with those problems , and the mayor cut us off			1
" video from earlier showed authorities dismantling tents at the camp			1
once the parks -- which @entity25 said are " pretty beat up " -- are cleared , temporary fencing will be erected so repairs can be made			0
one officer was struck in the leg earlier sunday by a projectile thrown from a crowd , and was taken to a hospital , but the injuries were not life - threatening , authorities said			1
one protester was arrested in a separate incident overnight , @entity25 said			1
video from that scene showed masses of protesters -- about 7,000 , according to @entity94 -- on downtown streets			2
in the early - morning hours sunday , police told demonstrators to leave the streets or face arrest			1
all but two of the demonstrators followed that order , many retreating to several parks , @entity0 affiliate @entity102 reported			2
yet hundreds returned by early sunday morning -- some of whom have not been affiliated with the @entity110 until now -- apparently hoping to witness a police confrontation , police lt. @entity105 said			1
on sunday , mayor @entity35 praised police for showing professionalism and restraint , noting the lack of serious injuries incurred over several police actions and stressing a calm , well - communicated approach			1
" i 'm prioritizing patience , " he said earlier in the day			0
" in order for us to do this peacefully , we need the time and folks on the ground need the time to do their work right			0
" in @entity131 , meanwhile , two police officers were injured and two occupy activists were arrested late sunday afternoon , according to a statement from that @entity135 's police department			1
protesters became upset when police began removing a food table from a park , some of them surrounding a police car			1
one woman then pushed a @entity131 police officer , according to the police statement			1
she and a male who came to her aid were arrested			2
one officer twisted his knee , while another was treated and released from an area hospital after being hit in the head , police said			2
this scuffle took place after , on saturday night , police in riot gear arrested 17 people as they cleared furniture and tents from an occupy encampment near the city 's civic center , police spokesman @entity154 told @entity0			1
the main issue , he said , was that the items were blocking a right of way			0
" people are welcome to come back and protest , but we do n't want them to do it in a way that 's not safe , " @entity154 said			0
what started as the @entity175 movement in @entity176 in september has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth			0
in @entity182 , mayor @entity181 said sunday he was increasing police presence near the @entity185 camp and asking the city 's police commissioner to " establish structures and strategic positioning and deployment of officers on a regular basis in that location			1
" what began as a peaceful protest 39 days ago has given way to increasing public safety and public health concerns , @entity181 told reporters			0
" @entity185 has changed , " he said at a noon press conference			1
" we 're seeing serious health and safety issues playing out on an almost daily basis ... the people of @entity185 have also changed and their intentions have changed			1
and all of this is not good for @entity182			0
" a woman reported she was sexually assaulted saturday night in a tent at the encampment , @entity181 said			2
@entity0 affiliate @entity211 reported a suspect was arrested in the alleged assault			1
in addition , there is the threat of fire near historic @entity218 and concerns about litter , public urination , defecation and graffiti , according to the mayor			2
numerous reports of thefts and assaults in the encampment have been made , and 15 emergency medical runs were made between october 6 and november 11 , he said			0
also , a maintenance project is set to begin soon on @entity218 , one of several , he said			0
a $ 50 million renovation is planned for @entity218 , where protesters have camped			2
@entity185 's general assembly voted friday night not to move from the plaza , and members have not responded in recent weeks to expressions of concern from the city , which has repeatedly tried to work with the protesters , he said			1
" many of the people that we talked to in the beginning of this event and activity are now gone , " he said			0
" we have things we need to do , " @entity181 said			0
" i understand that they have things on their mind as @entity5 and wish to express their free speech			0
i understand that , i get that , i 've defended that			0
the things we 're talking about , the activities that are going on , are not about free speech			0
they 're public health and public safety concerns that have nothing to do with @entity262 and corporations			0
" the protesters are " purposely standing in the way of nearly 1,000 jobs for @entity267 at a time of high unemployment , " @entity181 said			2
" they are blocking @entity267 from taking care of their families			0
" " misconduct is not about free speech , " the mayor said , " and the behavior we 're now seeing is running squarely into the needs of our city government that also represents the 99 %			2
as mayor of the city of @entity182 , i represent the 99 % also			2
" meanwhile , in @entity282 , police said on @entity283 19 people were arrested saturday night as authorities moved in to clear an @entity287 encampment at a downtown park			1
police had ordered protesters to leave the park after a man was found dead late thursday night			1
the cause of death was thought to be carbon monoxide poisoning and a drug overdose , @entity0 affiliate @entity293 reported			2
" we can no longer tolerate individuals camping on our streets , " @entity282 police chief @entity298 told reporters			1
however , " only camping is over , " @entity282 mayor @entity304 's office said on @entity283 -- protests can continue at the park			1
@entity293 reported authorities said protesters would be allowed to have a 24 - hour presence and one building , but the tents had to go			1
since camping began at the park , @entity304 's office said in the statement , " local law enforcement has responded to a dramatically increased amount of criminal activity in the park , and has made over 90 arrests in the area since early october			0
" a melee involving 30 people on wednesday night led to four arrests , @entity304 's office said , and public safety " has become increasingly questionable			0
additionally , the amount of human and animal waste , as well as drug paraphernalia , is an escalating public concern			0
" as police moved in saturday evening , according to video from the scene , protesters chanted , " this is what a police state looks like			1
" " our rights to assembly , which are embodied in the @entity340 , are still being violated , " protester @entity337 told @entity293			0
" our forefathers are speaking to us , telling us that this is what assembly looks like			0
not being able to camp here severely limits the ability of us to keep our coalition together			2
" " many thanks to all for a peaceful resolution , " @entity282 police tweeted late saturday			1
in @entity354 , @entity355 , police issued a third notice for demonstrators to vacate city parks on saturday , police spokeswoman officer @entity351 told @entity0			2
