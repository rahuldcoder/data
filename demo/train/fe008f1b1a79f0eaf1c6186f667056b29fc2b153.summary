-- @entity2 club @entity1 kept up their hoodoo over @entity4 with a 1 - 0 win on tuesday night as the @entity7 giants face the prospect of exiting @entity10 's premier competition at the last - 16 stage for the sixth successive season			1
@entity1 will take a narrow lead into the second leg of the @entity15 tie thanks to a stunning second - half strike from @entity18			1
@entity4 , who have lost their last three trips to the @entity21 without scoring a goal , will battle to overturn the deficit next month at their @entity24 -- which will host the final in may			1
@entity4 president @entity26 spent a fortune on players such as @entity29 and @entity30 in pre-season with the stated goal of winning the @entity15 , as the club did in his first reign , and ending the dominance of rivals @entity36			2
but coach @entity37 has seen his side languish in second place to @entity36 in @entity40 and suffer an embarrassing exit from the @entity42 , so will be hoping his expensive legion of stars can bounce back from this defeat			0
after both sides went close with several half - chances , @entity1 almost took the lead five minutes before halftime when winger @entity50 lashed a volley against the left - hand post as @entity54 's corner was only half - cleared			0
two minutes after the break , @entity55 midfielder @entity18 was allowed to surge to within 25 meters of the @entity4 goal and he fired a right - foot effort that sailed past keeper @entity59 and into the top corner of the net			2
@entity29 went close for @entity4 with a deflected effort from similar distance , but the visitors were almost caught on the counter-attack as @entity59 did well to deny @entity66			0
@entity67 tested @entity1 goalkeeper @entity68 before being replaced by former @entity1 star @entity69 with 15 minutes left , but @entity4 were unable to force an equalizer .			0
