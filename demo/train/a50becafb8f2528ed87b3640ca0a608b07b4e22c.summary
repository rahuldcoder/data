@entity0 -- before president @entity3 says a word during his tuesday @entity6 address , the backdrop will make a statement for him : that he is the decider			1
@entity3 is set to give his second @entity6 address , a speech meant to mark the end of combat missions in @entity13			1
but besides the remarks he will make , the setting of his speech will convey something , too			0
" the @entity6 invokes the center of the presidential authority			1
that 's the president 's office , that 's where he supposedly makes decisions , where he governs , " says presidential historian @entity20			1
" [ when ] a talk to the nation is given from that office , [ it ] is underscoring his executive powers , his leadership			0
" the @entity6 symbolizes power , command , and authority , @entity20 said			2
it shows the president , " as @entity35 put it , is the ' decider ' " and that symbolism is important			0
for example , former president @entity39 announced the start of the first @entity42 from the @entity6 , telling @entity43 and the world that he was the commander in chief just by setting the scene in the @entity6			2
and on the night of the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , former president @entity35 spoke to the @entity43 people from the @entity6 , to show he was in command and to reassure the nation			2
@entity20 points out the differences between giving a speech in the @entity6 versus a speech in a different venue			2
for example , @entity3 's speech in front of the joint session of @entity57 a year ago conveyed his desire to get @entity57 to act on health care reform			1
" a joint session of @entity57 has a different function , " @entity20 said			0
a speech in front of both the @entity65 and @entity66 shows the president is " trying to convince @entity57 to join with him			0
" when @entity3 addressed both chambers in september 2009 , the health care debate was still waging			2
he called for bipartisan proposals to address health care reform and focused attention on the issue , on @entity57 and on the presidency			0
an @entity6 address is different			1
the prime - time address focuses the attention singularly on the subject matter			0
" presidents do n't give speeches from the @entity6 casually , " @entity20 said			1
" it 's given with forethought and consideration			0
so the fact that he 's giving the current speech about the end of @entity43 's combat role in @entity13 is something that he wishes to emphasize and underscore and in a sense i think it 's a demonstration of his completion of his mission or fulfillment of a commitment that he made			1
" because of the singular focus on the subject matter during @entity3 's tuesday evening address , @entity3 will have to navigate the tricky road of marking the end of a war he did not support and honoring the lives of all the @entity43 killed in the war , @entity20 said			1
@entity3 must use a " certain amount of domestic diplomacy to bring the war to a close ; you do n't just end the war and say it 's a mistake			1
it 's unpalatable because of all the deaths , " @entity20 said			0
so @entity3 must do it in a way that is " politically palatable to the @entity43 public -- that is at the heart " of his address tuesday , @entity20 said			1
the @entity6 will also help convey a sense of intimacy of the message			2
since former president @entity126 , each president has delivered his farewell address from that room , using the office of the presidency to say goodbye to the @entity43 public			0
president @entity131 used the intimate space to comfort the public after space shuttle @entity133 exploded in 1986			0
president @entity135 used the room in 1968 to tell @entity43 he would not seek re-election and president @entity138 gave several speeches regarding the @entity140 , including his decision to resign from the presidency in the wake of @entity140 in 1974			0
@entity3 's other @entity6 address was two months ago to address the nation about the @entity147 oil disaster			1
and who does the presidential historian think was most successful at intimate talks to the @entity43 people ? @entity153 's fireside addresses -- although there were no televisions at the time , these radio talks were effective in boosting the country 's confidence .			0
