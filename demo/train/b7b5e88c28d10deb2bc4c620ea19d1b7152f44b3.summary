the @entity0 has secretly succeeded in breaking much of the encryption that keeps people 's personal data safe online , according to reports by @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			1
the reports , produced in partnership and published thursday , are the latest to emerge based on documents leaked by former @entity0 contractor @entity10 to @entity13 's @entity6 newspaper			1
according to the reports , the @entity0 , alongside its @entity13 equivalent , @entity14 , better known as @entity14 , has been able to unscramble much of the encoding that protects everything from personal e-mails to banking systems , medical records and @entity21 chats			1
the agencies ' methods include the use of supercomputers to crack codes , covert measures to introduce weaknesses into encryption standards and behind - doors collaboration with technology companies and internet service providers themselves			1
" through these covert partnerships , the agencies have inserted secret vulnerabilities -- known as backdoors or trapdoors -- into commercial encryption software , " @entity6 says			1
the @entity6 cites a 2010 @entity14 memo that it says describes a briefing on @entity0 accomplishments given to @entity14 employees			1
" for the past decade , @entity0 has lead ( sic ) an aggressive , multi-pronged effort to break widely used internet encryption technologies , " the memo reportedly says			1
" vast amounts of encrypted @entity21 data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable			2
" a second memo is quoted as saying that when the @entity13 analysts , who often work alongside @entity0 officers , were first told about the program , " those not already briefed were gobsmacked			1
" another document states that @entity14 has been working to find ways into the encrypted data sent via four big internet firms , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity63 's @entity62 , the reports claim			1
@entity14 told @entity64 it had no comment on @entity6 report			1
the reports claim that the @entity0 worked to develop more covert ways of unscrambling online data after losing a public battle in the 1990s to insert a government " back door " into all programming			1
' foundation of web security ' computer security expert @entity75 believes the revelation is the most important leak to date from @entity10			1
" it may not have gained as many headlines as some of his other stories , because most people do n't understand how crypto systems work			0
if indeed @entity88 intelligence does indeed have such a wide range of systems , then i 'm surprised , " he told @entity64			0
crypto encryption is relevant to everyday applications that everyone uses , for example in communications and transactions , he said			0
" now we learn that the foundation of web security has been compromised			0
" @entity75 , the chief research officer for @entity100 , said he believes the @entity0 and @entity14 had probably cracked the encryption by placing moles in key companies at key locations			1
" any major service provider must have sizable amounts of moles from intelligence agencies			0
remember that the @entity0 has 35,000 people working for it , " he said			2
" the ordinary user should not be worried by these revelations -- it 's obvious that intelligence agencies are not interested in hacking financial transactions -- but they should be outraged			0
" he suggested those outside the @entity88 should be the most concerned			0
" how many @entity88 politicians use @entity119 cloud - services ? almost none			0
but how many @entity119 politicians use @entity88 cloud services ? all of them , " he said			0
" remember that 96 % of the planet 's inhabitants are foreigners to the @entity88 , so it 's wrong that the @entity88 has a legal right to access foreign communications			0
" public concern the scope of hidden @entity88 surveillance programs has been brought to public light through leaks to media outlets by @entity10 , who fled the @entity88 and is now in @entity137 under temporary asylum			2
the revelations have led many @entity88 , according to polls , to harbor skepticism about the @entity0 programs			2
they 've also generated concern in @entity146 as well as from privacy groups and libertarians			0
last month , president @entity149 sought to allay people 's unease over the work of the intelligence agency in an interview with @entity156 " anchor @entity155			0
@entity149 said he was confident no one at the @entity0 is " trying to abuse this program or listen in on people 's e-mail			2
" the president chalked much of the concern with domestic snooping on changes in technology			0
" i think there are legitimate concerns that people have that technology is moving so quick , " @entity149 said			0
" what i recognize is that we 're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards and as technology moves forward , that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance			2
