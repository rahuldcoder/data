-- vice president @entity1 was right to call attention to @entity4 's @entity3			1
from the dilapidated state of @entity3 's @entity8 to the minimal public transport links and outdated air traffic control system , the metro area 's airports are in desperate need of modernization			1
but now it 's time for @entity1 and other leaders to put their money where their rhetoric is			1
the @entity17 and local politicians must step up and take sustained action			2
and the goal should be to fix the problem , not point fingers			0
despite its outdated condition , @entity3 serves 25 million passengers a year			1
as the closest airport to @entity27 , it is coveted by airlines			0
moreover , @entity4 's three major airports serve more than 110 million people a year , account for 500,000 jobs and contribute $ 63 billion to our regional economy , according to a november 2013 study from @entity35 and @entity36			2
and they are the largest global gateway to the world for international travelers , with @entity41 data showing that @entity42 handles the most international visitors and @entity44 the fifth most			0
as such , the airports serve as a symbol for the entire @entity47			1
airports are responsible for the first and last impressions visitors have , and in @entity4 , some 54 million tourists visited last year			2
they are fundamentally vital to our economy , tourism industry and our global reputation			0
as the vice president pointed out , @entity4 's airports are a symbol of underinvestment in infrastructure throughout the country			1
when the @entity63 landed in @entity4 50 years ago last week , our airports were a symbol of the modern , efficient and forward - looking transportation infrastructure in the @entity47			1
now , they are the embodiment of our falling behind the rest of the world			0
cities all over the world have recognized the significance of their airports and have invested in state - of - the - art technology and infrastructure			2
our own @entity35 survey showed that airports from @entity78 to @entity79 are providing innovative amenities such as 40 foot slides , ice skating rinks and on airport baby strollers to ensure that passengers have the best possible experience			1
the same survey showed @entity3 and @entity4 area airports at the bottom of the list of passenger amenities			1
the bottom line is we to have to invest in our airports to avoid losing out to national and international competitors and to provide a better quality of life for those millions of passengers			2
at @entity3 , here 's how : -- 21st century terminals : @entity3 's @entity8 , built in 1964 , is a prime example of an outdated terminal desperately in need of redevelopment , which is why it 's so important for the @entity101 to deliver on the promise of a modern , efficient and innovative terminal			1
there are also significant space constraints with only two short runways and limited parking , which are challenges that need to be addressed			0
-- better passenger amenities : @entity109 voted the worst airport in the @entity47 by passengers , @entity3 is definitely not known for its amenities			1
all of the @entity4 area airports would benefit from providing what are now basic services , such as free @entity116 , which would help business travelers , and leave visitors with a better impression of their time in @entity4			0
-- improved transportation links : public transportation access to all of @entity4 's airports is behind other world class cities , which have one seat train rides directly from the city center to the airport			2
options for getting to @entity3 via public transportation are very limited , but a @entity130 , with dedicated lanes and just a few stops to the airport , would help remedy that			1
this service would remove the threat of traffic delays normally associated with buses and provide a convenient and reliable direct ride to the airport			0
reviving long dormant plans for a direct subway extension to @entity3 are also worth exploring			2
-- bring @entity143 to @entity4 first : @entity3 , along with @entity42 and @entity44 , is the most delayed airport traffic control system in the country			1
every day , our airspace contributes to one half to three quarters of all delays around the country			0
the solution is @entity143 , the new satellite - based air traffic control system			0
replacing the old 1960s radar technology means fewer delays on the ground and in the air			0
but the @entity158 has to step up and make it happen in @entity4			0
right now , the federal government is years behind in developing @entity143 , and the @entity158 wants to roll it out in smaller markets first , despite the tremendous impact the @entity4 airspace has on national delays			0
it 's past time to stop ignoring our airports and to move them to the front of the priorities line			0
that 's how @entity3 will go from @entity172 to world class			1
the opinions expressed are solely those of the authors .			0
