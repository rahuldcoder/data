-- global basketball icon @entity1 is making a concerted effort to get his head around an altogether different ball game which he admits is the " number one sport in the world "			1
and it is parental responsibility that has piqued the eight - time @entity9 all star 's interest in soccer			1
" i 'm trying to get into it , " the @entity14 star told @entity0			1
" my youngest son @entity17 is playing soccer now , so i 've got to learn the sport			1
" so this season i 'm really diving into soccer , learning the rules of the game			1
with @entity17 , and also my lady , they both love soccer , so i got to get into it			0
" @entity1 's best advice @entity1 is yet to pick a football team to support , but the 30 - year - old is keen to sample the atmosphere of the planet 's favorite sport			1
" i need to learn about it first , but i do want to go to a game , " he explained			0
" i want to feel the crowd and the energy -- it 's the reason that soccer is the number one sport in the world			2
" it is football 's global appeal that has prompted the @entity9 to make a strategic marketing push in targeting key markets like @entity47 , @entity48 and the @entity49			2
that campaign has been boosted by the success of players like @entity47 's @entity53 , whose nine - year stint with the @entity55 raised the profile of the league in @entity58			0
meanwhile @entity61 brother @entity59 and @entity62 , who play for @entity64 and @entity65 respectively , helped their country to a silver medal at the recent @entity69 -- when the @entity70 beat @entity71 in the final to take gold			0
" it 's made ( the @entity9 ) very global , " said @entity1			1
" the international players are very talented , and it 's been getting better and better			2
the game is so big , around the world now , as big as it 's ever been			2
" we take some pride in that			0
but we got a lot of work to do over here , because they keep getting better and better around the world because of this game			0
we 're just happy to be the guys that are able to take this game globally			0
" of all the overseas arrivals that have made their mark in the @entity9 , @entity1 singled out for special mention @entity93 's @entity92 , who was named @entity95 as the @entity96 beat the @entity14 to the 2011 championship			1
" you look and say @entity92 is probably the one that has the most of the respect from the standpoint of what he 's done for so many years in the @entity9			1
" obviously they beat us in the finals and winning the championship really put him up there in his place where he should be in our time			0
but there are other players that have been there before i played that could be named as well			0
" despite the @entity9 's growth , it has some way to go before it can rival football 's worldwide appeal given the last soccer @entity125 final saw global television audience figures peak at 530.9 million			1
" it 's very big , " said @entity1 on basketball 's continued expansion			2
" we got a way to go to catch up with soccer , but i think our game is doing very , very well			2
we can be very proud of that but we have still got a lot of work to do			0
" @entity1 : a father first			0
