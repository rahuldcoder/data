-- @entity1 knows the law well			1
he has a law degree and passed the @entity5 bar exam -- on his first try			2
now he wants to practice that law , giving advice and taking on cases			2
" i 'm fighting for my @entity10 dream , " he said			1
wednesday was a landmark day -- his first case before the @entity5 @entity12			2
but he 's not able to act as a lawyer in front of the justices , because the law he loves is not on his side			2
@entity1 , 36 , has been an undocumented immigrant since he was brought to the @entity10 as a child from his native @entity19 , and that means he can not get a law license			1
it does n't matter what qualifications he has			0
it also does n't matter that he has been approved for a green card since 1995 and has been on the waiting list since			0
the line for @entity19 citizens is so long it could be another six or seven years before his permanent residency is confirmed , he estimated			0
he has the support of @entity5 attorney general @entity31 , who wrote in a brief to the state supreme court last year : " admitting @entity1 to the bar would be consistent with state and federal policy that encourages immigrants , both documented and undocumented , to contribute to society			1
" and the state bar wants to admit him			0
in many ways it seems straightforward : how can someone without legal status become licensed as a lawyer , whose job entails upholding the law ? that 's the argument made by the @entity50 in an amicus brief to the court			1
" aliens , including those that lack immigration status , are presumptively ineligible to receive public benefits , " such as a law license , officials wrote , referring to a 1996 law signed by president @entity60			1
the argument is that the court is partially funded by the state , and the state can not fund an undocumented immigrant , so the court may not issue a law license			1
but @entity1 and his supporters believe the issue is not that simple as they make their arguments before the @entity5 @entity12 on wednesday			1
in addition to @entity1 's lawyer , @entity71 , @entity71 for the @entity72 , @entity73 for the attorney general 's office and @entity75 for @entity10 @entity50 appeared in court			1
the case is being closely watched for the precedent it could set , not just for @entity5 , but the nation			2
the court 's decision could affect hundreds of other young professionals in this country seeking a license , according to @entity86 , an immigration attorney based in @entity5			2
@entity1 's case has received nationwide attention because of two similar cases in @entity90 and @entity91			2
in @entity90 , bar admissions candidate and undocumented immigrant @entity92 , 26 , passed the bar and also could n't receive his law license			1
he , along with the @entity96 , petitioned the state supreme court in december 2011 for an advisory opinion : " are undocumented immigrants eligible for admission to the @entity101 ? " in @entity91 , @entity103 law graduate @entity102 , 29 , who was also brought to the @entity10 illegally as a child , filed an application to practice law in 2012			1
@entity102 has also advocated for a federal @entity107 and helped launch the @entity108 , a political and lobbying voice to help pass federal and state legislation for undocumented youth			0
all three men have been open about their immigration status			0
" basically all i 'm seeking is my law license in @entity5 , which i already had but was taken away from me because i 'm undocumented , " @entity1 said to @entity0 en @entity114			1
for about two weeks , @entity1 was sworn in as an attorney			2
then he received a notice from the state bar that his admission was in error			0
" it was very , very hard for me to have to tell my family that the celebration we had meant nothing , " @entity1 said			0
" it killed me inside to tell them that i really was n't a lawyer			0
" many undocumented immigrants brought to the @entity10 as children qualify for two - year work visas under president @entity132 's @entity134 program , but @entity1 is too old to be eligible			1
he qualifies for a green card through his father , who became a lawful permanent resident under the 1986 amnesty law , but is still waiting			0
" immigrants must wait longer if they are from @entity19 , @entity147 , @entity148 or the @entity149 , because lots of people from those countries want to immigrate to the @entity10 , and so demand is greater than supply , " said @entity142 , professor of immigration and citizenship law at the @entity145 , " this seems superficially fair but i believe it 's quite unfair and unequal , because the waiting period can vary so much			2
" @entity155 , former prosecutor for the @entity72 , said @entity1 should n't be given his law license because his immigration status would be in violation of a civil immigration statute and could affect his ability to represent his clients			1
" if mr. @entity1 works or not is a separate question that deserves independent analysis , " @entity86 said			0
@entity165 's view is that although undocumented immigrants generally may not be employees , they can be independent contractors			0
they could take clients as solo practitioners , to work on specific cases or projects , or to have an ongoing relationship as long as they had multiple clients			0
this ability to work as an independent contractor also means they could do volunteer legal work of certain kinds			0
the @entity10 @entity181 guarantees public educational access through high school			0
beyond high school there is no constitutional guarantee of access , but traditionally each state can decide to admit undocumented students to its public colleges and universities			0
some bar them , some admit them as nonresidents at higher tuition , and some , like @entity5 , admit them at resident tuition rates			0
@entity142 said whatever @entity5 decides , " it is a decision that the federal government should and must respect			0
" the @entity5 @entity12 has up to 90 days to decide on the future of @entity1			1
if it denies him his law license , he said he is prepared to take his case to the @entity10 @entity12			1
should it be legal for an undocumented immigrant to practice law ? share your thoughts in the comments .			1
