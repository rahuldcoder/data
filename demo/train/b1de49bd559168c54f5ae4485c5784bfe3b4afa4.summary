-- @entity1 called on the masses to skip work and school on may 1 , and to close their wallets			1
all this was supposed to amount to a general strike , if not an @entity8			1
some even talked about bringing down capitalism			0
but the small demonstrations in many @entity12 cities and in other cities across the world had little effect			0
rush hour on the @entity17 in @entity18 , supposed to be a major center of protest , flowed			0
in @entity22 , two blocks were closed by the authorities in anticipation of possible disruptions			0
reports were that protesters in @entity28 did not shut down traffic , as they planned to do			0
some 2,000 demonstrated in @entity30 , and 7,000 next to a @entity32 factory , one of the most poorly attended demonstrations in the recent experience of this troubled land			0
workers marched in several other cities across the world , as they do on every may 1			0
historically , general strikes were considered a powerful tool , meant to demonstrate the power of the people ( often organized labor ) , able at least to gum up the working of major segments of the economy			2
in @entity49 , general strikes were used to force the government to make significant concessions			2
for instance , the 2006 demonstrations over the controversial @entity53 ( or contrat @entity54 re embauche , first employment contract , which would have made it easier for employers to fire young workers ) lasted two months before president @entity62 scrapped the legislation			2
in the @entity12 , the last general strike took place in 1946			1
while some 100,000 workers from 142 unions participated , it did not lead to concessions by the powers that be , let alone bring down anything			0
this time ? if the past is any predictor of the future , the deliberately nonhierarchical @entity1 movement , with its fuzzy messages and vague goals , is not going to leave a major mark			1
@entity79 " fizzled ? " not so fast , say @entity80 some observers saw , at least initially , " an irresistible symmetry " between @entity1 and the tea party , despite some clear differences			1
an article in @entity86 described @entity1 as a " new outpouring of protest ... driven by the same fuel that gave fire to the tea party			1
" in an october 2011 interview , president @entity92 said , " i understand the frustrations being expressed in those protests			2
in some ways , they 're not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the tea party			1
" the comparison is informative , but in a rather different way			0
it highlights how weak the left is and how strong the right is in @entity12 politics			0
the tea party has a sharply edged message and has used its considerable following to elect public officials , who in turn have affected public policy			1
for instance , they prevented the @entity116 leadership from compromising with @entity92 on raising taxes in exchange for cutting entitlements and government outlays			0
and the tea party put deficit reduction on the top of the political agenda			1
speaking about the august 2011 deficit deal , sen. @entity125 said , " i do n't think without the tea party we would have had an agreement			1
" there is little in @entity1 's record that compares to these political victories			1
defenders of @entity1 may well argue that it was never meant to be a political power , but rather a cultural force , more like the counterculture of the ' 60s than a new civil rights movement			1
@entity139 argues that " it was not a new set of policy ideas that was being born â € ” the world was already overloaded with these , unacted upon â € ” but a new spirit			2
... " but the cultural messages occupy @entity146 carries , say , environmental responsibility or divorce from capitalism , are far from clear			2
and while the counterculture could thrive ( briefly ) in an age in which @entity12 was well - heeled , the message of opting out of the prevailing system does not seem to bring out the masses who seek employment , to avoid foreclosure , or simply to make ends meet			0
arguably the greatest achievement attributed to @entity1 is that it put inequality on the agenda of @entity12 politics , with its most memorable slogan : " we are the 99 %			1
" writing in the @entity166 , @entity165 described this line as a new " national shorthand " for the vast economic disparities facing the @entity12 , noting that " whatever the long - term effects of the @entity172 , protesters have succeeded in implanting ' we are the 99 % ' ... into the cultural and political lexicon			0
" even an article in the conservative @entity177 declared @entity1 has changed the public discourse , making inequality the topic of the day			1
there is no question that inequality has been rising in the @entity12 and that it raises numerous issues concerning what is a fair distribution of income and wealth , what taxes we ought to raise , and how to prevent those who acquire great economic power from also gaining excessive political power ( through campaign contributions )			0
i share these social justice concerns			0
however , i can not help but note that there is a world of difference between putting something on the front pages of the newspapers for a few weeks and achieving changes in laws and , above all , in the distribution of wealth			0
given that @entity1 has not advocated any specific ways to reduce inequality and does not have the political organization to back up such an agenda , either others will have to find ways to curb inequality or we will see little progress on this front in the great budget battles to come shortly after the 2012 election			1
most assuredly , a general strike that fizzles will not serve the cause of reducing inequality , or even help @entity1 find its sea legs			1
occupy @entity146 will have more opportunities to show that it did not flame out ; however , it had better come up with a more cogent strategy , or it will soon be one more wasted force , one more protest movement that vented feelings but engendered precious little real social change			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

@entity231 says @entity1 's @entity234 protests made little *splash*
he says general strike sometimes effective in history . but @entity1 's goals too vague
he says it 's no focused tea party , which has affected policy , helped elect officials
@entity231 : occupy has contributed a slogan , but where 's its real influence on policy ?
