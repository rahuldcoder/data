for a pop star with millions of frenzied fans , @entity0 does a pretty good job keeping tabs on them			1
she has a history of stalking -- er , " @entity0 - lurking " -- fans on social media , figuring out their likes , dislikes and what 's going on in their lives			1
and she loves to shower super loyal ones with some enormous gifts			0
but the package that @entity17 received may be one of the most complicated presents yet			0
the giant box , labeled " @entity21 " instead of " @entity22 , " contained so many meticulously wrapped gifts that it took @entity17 several minutes to open them all			0
i was thinking about you today , and how you have been there cheering me on in the most thoughtful and creative ways , " the singer wrote on a card			0
" i 'm not a good painter but i think you 're so beautiful and positive , even though you 're dealing with the stress life brings , so i wanted to make you something			1
" yep , the @entity36 winner sent a custom - made floral painting to her fan			1
she even sent a @entity39 of herself doing so as proof			0
then there was a necklace			0
" was mine , now yours , " @entity0 explained			2
finally , a gift to help ease @entity17 's student loan debt			1
" @entity17 , now you 're $ 1989 closer to paying off those student loans , " @entity0 wrote			1
1989 , of course , is n't just @entity0 's birth year -- it 's the name of her latest album and world tour			2
by this point , @entity17 could barely speak from all the emotion			0
" i do n't even know what to say , " she managed to say			0
fortunately she has time to think of a response before september -- when she 'll be at two of @entity0 's concerts			2
@entity0 's year - end gift video brings all the feels @entity3 's @entity61 contributed to this report .			1
