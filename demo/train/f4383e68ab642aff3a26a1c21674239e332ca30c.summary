-- @entity2 teenager @entity1 enjoyed a remarkable debut to @entity5 football as he curled home an injury - time winner that sent @entity8 back to the top of the @entity10 with a thrilling 3 - 2 home win over @entity12			1
@entity1 receives a hug from manager sir @entity14 after scoring @entity8 's last - gasp winner			1
it seemed @entity8 would have to settle for a point after @entity19 's double had only proved enough to keep @entity8 level against a @entity12 side that thoroughly deserved a lead provided by @entity23 and @entity24			2
but 17 - year - old substitute @entity1 , a former member of the @entity26 academy who arrived at @entity27 in 2007 , was to have the last word			2
who is @entity1 ? at exactly the same moment as @entity31 struck for @entity32 at @entity33 on saturday , @entity1 turned onto @entity35 ' low pass before unleashing a stunning shot that curled past @entity37 and sent @entity27 into ecstasy			1
@entity8 , missing a host of players including @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , started poorly against an out - of - form @entity12 side who had gone eight matches without victory			2
however , a stunning piece of skill from @entity19 gave them a 14th - minute lead			0
@entity53 and @entity37 got themselves into a muddle , forcing the @entity12 keeper to handle a back pass			0
the resulting free - kick saw @entity35 brush the ball to @entity19 , who sent a fierce shot over the wall and into the roof of @entity37 's net in a flash			0
@entity12 were not to be denied and they drew level when @entity66 wriggled his way into space by the touchline and @entity23 crept between @entity70 and @entity71 to steer a deft header into the bottom corner of the net			0
the visitors then took a deserved lead on the hour mark when @entity19 gifted possession to @entity79 , who swept upfield unopposed			0
he found @entity23 , whose perfect cross was headed home by @entity24			0
the goal stung @entity8 into life and they levelled with 13 minutes remaining when @entity84 exchanged first - time passes with @entity35 on the edge of the @entity12 box , before presenting @entity19 with a lay - off			1
the world player of the year did not have a lot to aim at but he found the one small gap @entity37 was unable to cover			0
a draw would have been a fair result , but @entity8 poured forward and in the third minute of five added on minutes at the end of the match , @entity1 delivered the killer blow to leave the defending champions a point clear of @entity32 at the top with a game in hand			1
meanwhile , in the day 's other match , @entity101 moved to within one point of @entity12 in sixth position after a comfortable 4 - 0 victory over @entity106 , courtesy of a double from on - loan @entity110 striker @entity109 .			1

@entity1 scores an injury - time winner as @entity115 defeat @entity12 3 - 2
the win lifts champions above @entity32 to top of @entity10 by one point
@entity101 *consolidate* sixth place in table after a comfortable 4 - 0 win over @entity106
