two days after snow began to fall -- and a day after many @entity1 , including hundreds of schoolchildren , finally made it home -- the state 's governor apologized thursday for what many saw as an insufficient and ineffective response			1
gov. @entity8 told reporters he was " not satisfied " with how his state dealt with the 2.6 inches of snow plus the sheets of ice that it turned into , leading to massive gridlock throughout metro @entity11			1
in addition to students stranded at school , many drivers camped out in their cars or abandoned them by the hundreds along thoroughfares big and small			2
" i accept responsibility for the fact that we did not make preparation early enough to avoid these consequences , " @entity8 said			2
" ... i 'm not looking for a scapegoat			2
i 'm the governor , the buck stops with me			1
" speaking later thursday with @entity33 's @entity32 , @entity8 said " we all made errors in judgment " and that " the major lesson is we have to be more proactive			1
" according to the governor , that means taking action like declaring a state of emergency earlier on -- even if it ends up being a false alarm , relatively -- and making sure the resources are available to deal with such a crisis			1
" apologies are something that do n't change the circumstances , " said the governor , a @entity47 running for re-election in november			1
" what we intend to do is change the circumstances			2
" @entity54 now taking a kinder approach @entity56 has helped thaw some of the snow , slush and ice in northern @entity60 , thanks to sunny skies and temperatures that crept above freezing			1
yet while the major interstates are largely clear , the danger is hardly over			2
the @entity68 's forecast calls for nighttime temperatures in the mid-teens through much of the region			1
that means the threat of yet more ice , especially on untreated roads			1
to that point , while a few area school districts such as @entity79 and @entity80 counties are vowing to reopen , most in the area will remain closed because of still - hazardous conditions , especially on secondary roads			0
one man who lives on such a road is @entity86			0
the 50 - year - old said thursday afternoon that no one had treated his tree - lined road on the city of @entity11 's northern outskirts , along which there are hundreds of homes			1
instead , drivers are crawling past remaining icy patches			0
@entity86 , who posted pictures to @entity98 , recalled how a friend retrieved his hungry 10 - year - old son from school tuesday night because buses could n't move while he had to ditch his car up the street			1
he said he 's concerned not only about the road now , but how authorities -- whatever their comments to date -- will respond to the next crisis			1
" the mayor ( @entity111 ) was very defensive and so was the governor , " @entity86 said of both public officials ' earlier comments			1
" ... it 's just a lot of frustration			1
" @entity60 emergency official under fire at thursday 's news conference , the director of the @entity118 acknowledged having made " a terrible error in judgment " in not opening the emergency operations center six hours earlier than he did			1
@entity124 @entity123 said he first talked to the governor about how serious the situation was becoming , particularly around metro @entity11 , as the forecast shifted at 9 or 9:30 a.m. tuesday			1
this was some six hours after meteorologists upgraded to a winter storm warning			1
" i got this one wrong , " he said			0
" i made the decision not to do anything until later that morning			0
" he said that next time out when forecasts change , @entity118 and the state team it coordinates will respond more aggressively			1
asked whether he planned to resign , @entity123 said , " that 's not my call			1
" deal was noncommittal about @entity123 's future , saying it was too early to talk about firing anybody			1
but the governor did say that during tuesday morning , " we were told that further action was not necessary			1
" to that point , in an e-mail exchange with @entity8 's chief of staff , @entity123 affirmed monday afternoon that he would have alerted the governor 's staff " if the weather was going to be bad , " but he did n't believe that was the case then			1
the e-mails were first reported by the @entity154 and later obtained by @entity33			0
in another e-mail between the two around 4:15 p.m. tuesday , the emergency management director acknowledged the huge challenge -- how to treat slick roads when they were covered by so many slow - moving or stalled vehicles			2
" i do n't see how we are going to get rid of the ice with such low temps predicted , " @entity123 wrote			1
" too many cars out there now to make a lot of progress			2
" @entity111 cited the mass exodus from his city as largely responsible for the resulting gridlock			0
the mayor admitted a " lack of experience " in dealing with " severe weather events " in @entity11 also played a role			1
" we made an error in the way that we released our citizens , " the mayor told @entity185 's " today , " claiming that the situation might have gone more smoothly if schools , then private businesses , then government offices released people in that order			2
" i think it would have made a major difference			0
" @entity189 vet : ' i think they failed ' whether such explanations or promises of change will assuage the legions of critics remains to be seen			0
the crisis dragged on far longer than many would have liked			0
it was not until wednesday evening -- more than a day after the snowfall began -- that @entity201 announced that all of metropolitan @entity11 's schoolchildren had gotten home			1
some chided officials for learning little from a 2011 ice storm that paralyzed the region for a week , because no one could safely get anywhere			1
the @entity154 's @entity211 - winning cartoonist , @entity210 , depicted @entity8 and @entity111 responding to the snowfall by making snow angels			2
in fact , as the snow picked up midday tuesday , those two officials were together at a ceremony honoring the @entity11 mayor			1
" i think they failed , " retired lt. gen. @entity220 , who led the recovery efforts after @entity189 on the @entity222 , said of the official response			1
" ... admit it , fix it and be ready for next week			0
" the anger was pervasive , among locals such as @entity86 and travelers such as @entity230 , a truck driver from @entity231 who gave up after sitting in traffic for 27 hours for what should have been a three and a half hour trip			0
" i have never been failed by officials like i have here			0
still no equipment , no well - being check			0
no plan , " @entity230 told @entity33 on wednesday			0
" i guess they 're waiting for it to melt			0
" @entity47 @entity241 , a former director of the @entity242 , understands the challenges that officials face as they weigh how to react -- and risk overreacting -- when bad weather approaches			0
taking steps such as opening up shelters , evacuating people and urging businesses to shutter is costly , but so are the consequences of not acting			0
" that costs a lot of money , " said @entity241 , now a consultant			2
" but how much is a life worth ? " deaths and new life those who wo n't be forking over money include motorists who abandoned their cars in @entity60 cities such as @entity11 and @entity262 , where authorities have vowed that vehicles will be towed free of charge			1
the towing of the remaining abandoned cars was expected to begin around 9 p.m. thursday			0
some people in the area have been able to rescue their vehicles sooner			0
many of them showed up still sleep - deprived and seething at two locations thursday to get chauffeured to their vehicles by members of the @entity275 in four - wheel - drive vehicles			0
deal has extended the state of emergency through sunday night " to assure that all necessary resources are available for state agencies and local governments to clear roads and all other winter storm - related obstacles			1
" yet it 's not just @entity60 that 's dealing with the storm 's aftermath			1
parts of @entity289 were still digging out on thursday , with the @entity290 declaring in the morning that many roads there were " still impassible ( and ) closed to regular traffic			0
" " civilian vehicles can not safely travel due to icing and impede the travel of emergency vehicles responding to calls , " the office said on @entity295 , before reporting hints of progress later in the day			2
highway patrolmen in @entity305 and @entity306 both responded to some 600 calls apiece from motorists who 'd either crashed or abandoned their cars after the weather hit			0
throughout the @entity312 , the icy weather was blamed for 10 deaths -- five of them in @entity289 and the others in @entity305 and @entity306			0
but there were also plenty of signs of hope and life amid the madness and mess			0
take the story of @entity323 , who was stuck in her car with her husband when she went into labor			0
as a police officer looked on , @entity327 gave birth to a daughter , whom she and her husband , @entity331 , named @entity332			0
" when we gave her the name @entity332 , it just fully explained the whole situation , " the new mother told @entity33 's @entity334 on wednesday			2
" just by the grace of @entity340 that we all came out healthy			0
" there were also lifesavers , like the manager of a @entity345 supermarket in @entity262 who opened the store 's doors and fed about 80 people , according to @entity33 affiliate @entity350			2
" i do n't consider myself a hero , " the manager @entity351 said , deflecting praise from those who called him just that			2
" it was just second nature			0
it 's what we would do for anybody who needs help / " then there 's dr. @entity362 , a @entity363 , @entity289 , neurosurgeon			2
as falling snow brought things to a standstill on tuesday , @entity362 trekked over 6 miles in scrubs , a jacket and slip - on shoes from one hospital to another for an emergency brain surgery			2
the patient had only a 10 % of living given the size and nature of his brain hemorrhage , according to @entity378			0
but he did make it , said the surgeon : " ( we ) battled a demon there for a while and it all worked out ok			0
" @entity362 said he 's been at work for days , though he has n't been alone as other medical personnel have also stuck it out			1
" everyone is doing the same thing , " he told @entity33 's @entity388 on thursday			2
" everyone is pitching in , the nurses are staying overnight			0
you 've got to do what you 've got to do			0

" i do n't see how we are going to get rid of the ice , " emergency official admitted
@entity60 's governor apologizes , says that changes are needed to *prevent* a repeat
he extends state of emergency through sunday night to free up needed resources
" it 's just a lot of frustration , " an @entity11 *resident* says of the storm response
