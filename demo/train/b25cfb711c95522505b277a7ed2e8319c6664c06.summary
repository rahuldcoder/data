-- five - time gold medal speed skater @entity1 was hanging out in a @entity4 locker room saturday , watching tv as a much younger phenom named @entity7 broke his 30 - year @entity9 record			1
that record , for the most decorated @entity12 man in @entity14 history , stood since 1980 , when @entity1 shot to fame at the @entity14 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
to hear @entity1 tell it , watching the 27 - year - old @entity7 eclipse his record did n't matter much			1
" @entity7 and i could n't have cared less , " said @entity1 , now 51			1
" all of us at this level do n't really look at medal records as very important			0
we 're very proud of what we are doing and what we 've done as athletes -- and if you happen to win a medal all of us consider that to be a great thing			0
" the difference between @entity7 's medals and @entity1 's is that @entity1 won his all during the same @entity14 , an unprecedented feat that astonished @entity9 fans around the world			1
fast forward 30 years and @entity1 's passion for athletic competition and camaraderie has n't faded			1
now an orthopedic surgeon , he treats and helps train the 2010 men 's speed skating team , including @entity7			1
" @entity42 is very dedicated and focused in his pursuit of the sport , " said @entity1			1
" but he needs to understand that when an event is coming up he needs to really start backing off some of those outside interests so he can put in the time and effort to be a world - class skater			0
" with a smile in his voice , @entity1 offers an example of @entity7 's recent appearance on @entity57 's " @entity56			1
" " he 's more of a celebrity personality than most of the skaters , " said @entity1			1
@entity1 's fairly familiar with celebrity			1
those five medals in @entity16 got his boyish @entity64 face plastered on newspapers and @entity66 worldwide			2
although @entity1 said he is n't recognized much anymore , once in a while his name " will fire a synapse in many people 's minds			1
" living a quiet life in @entity72 , @entity73 , with his wife , who is also an orthopedic surgeon , and two children , @entity1 advises some of the world 's fastest men on skates , including @entity7 's friend and fellow olympian @entity80			1
helping @entity80 , who won speed skating gold wednesday night in the 1000m long track , requires " making sure that all his needs are taken care of , " said @entity1			1
" sometimes that can be very demanding and very hard			1
" @entity80 accepts little training guidance from others			1
one of the younger skaters on the @entity12 team , 19 - year - old @entity89 won his first @entity9 medal saturday with a bronze in the men 's 1500m short track			2
what 's remarkable , according to @entity1 , was that @entity89 had been badly injured in competition just five months earlier			2
@entity89 , who crashed into the boards during trials in september slicing a deep gash into his left thigh , has made a near complete recovery , said @entity1			2
he said @entity89 's race on saturday answered important questions about his mental recovery			0
" physically , we were sure he was good , but we were n't sure about his confidence level before the race			0
" @entity89 said he 'd met @entity109 before his injury , but it was while the doctor was treating @entity89 that they got to know each other well			0
" he 's very humble and very down to earth , and i strive to be like that as well			0
it was great to get to know him and talk to him for who he was -- and not for what he did , " said @entity89			0
" he was one of the hardest working guys in the sport , and that 's why he did so well			0
" the cheese remedy : a second opinion would dr. @entity1 offer a second opinion about @entity12 skier @entity128 's much talked - about home remedy for a bruised shin ? she injured herself during practice just days before winning gold wednesday in the alpine downhill			1
@entity128 's remedy : wrapping her shin with a soft @entity136 cheese			0
" we like to practice evidence - based medicine , " he said jokingly			0
" i do n't think anybody is going to take that remedy home and practice it on their patients			0
" the closest thing to a home remedy for @entity1 was the random newspaper , moleskin or felt he and fellow skaters would use to pad their skate boots to make them fit better			2
" you 're always trying to work with what you 've got , " he said			0
" but i 've never gone as crazy as telling somebody to do a cheese wrap			0
" let 's remember that before he became a doctor @entity1 set four @entity9 records and a world record at @entity16			2
shortly after his history - making feat , @entity1 launched a second career racing bicycles , eventually competing in the @entity160			2
this year , @entity1 enjoyed @entity162 's opening ceremonies with other @entity9 veterans , some of whom also gained fame on ice : figure skaters @entity168 and @entity170			2
each olympian , he said , knows what the other has gone through to reach their athletic dreams			0
" we enjoy the limelight , " said @entity1			2
" we were recognized for what we did			0
and when you go back for each @entity14 you sort of get your ego stroked again			1
" much has changed about long track speed skating in the past 30 years , but @entity1 said no single development has done more to push athletes faster around the icy oval than the clap skate			1
unlike traditional skates with blades well - fixed at the bottom of the boots , the blades on clap skates are hinged at the balls of the feet , shaving a precious 2 seconds off a skater 's time with each lap. " i 'm jealous , i wish i 'd had a chance to try those things			0
" has anything else changed in the sport over the years ? yes , he said , most speed skaters now perform in warmer indoor venues			0
laughing he describes the effects of brutally cold temperatures on the male anatomy			0
" @entity206 , these guys have no clue how cold it can be out on an open rink			0

@entity1 won five gold medals in speed skating at the 1980 @entity14
@entity1 : @entity7 needs to focus more on skating when events near
the way @entity80 trains can be " very demanding and very hard "
" when you go back for each @entity14 you sort of get your ego stroked again , " said the skating icon
