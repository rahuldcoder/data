in the @entity4 @entity3 basement , an auditorium full of congressional staff grapples with the consequences of how their bosses upstairs wrote the @entity7			1
starting monday , they will have to choose a health care plan			1
" a lot of employees are planning to separate because of this , " one man stood up and declared at the first - ever congressional orientation for @entity7			1
by " separate , " he meant quit			0
it was one of many sharp moments of concern at the two information sessions set up by @entity20 administrators thursday			1
both were closed to the press , but @entity23 was able to watch on an in - house tv channel			0
the camera faced the stage , not the audience and staff members who spoke could only be heard , not seen in the broadcast			0
they did not identify themselves and as a result , we can not name them			0
several expressed doubts and fears about leaving their familiar federal employees plan and switching to the exchange , including a little - known but potentially costly issue			0
" i think the federal government needs to seriously look at whether it is contributing to age discrimination ( by forcing staff onto the exchange ) , " one women said			0
" the monthly formula for older workers is a serious , serious hit , " she went on			1
" in addition to what i 'm paying now , it will be another $ 300 to $ 400 a month			0
" under the federal employee health plan , premiums do not vary by age			1
that 's possible because the federal benefits system includes millions of employees and negotiates with insurers for that massive group , spreading out the costs widely			0
but in the exchange , @entity63 acts as a small business and insurers view it more by individual health needs , charging different premiums for higher - risk staff , like older employees			1
example : under one @entity74 plan available to congressional staff , the premium for a 20 - year - old is $ 262.48 a month , versus $ 842.41 a month for a 60 - year - old			2
that 's not unique to congressional workers			1
but it is new for them			0
compounding the " hit " they feel is how much @entity63 kicks in to help with the premium , its employer contribution			0
it maxes out at $ 426 a month			0
the @entity86 official told @entity23 that those two things result in much higher premiums for older workers in the exchange than they are paying now under the federal health plan			1
of course it also means lower relative premiums for younger workers			2
" you should look into that , " one man said at thursday 's orientation			2
the issues for congressional workers are not just financial			2
some staffers want to select a plan that excludes abortion , " but we 've had difficulties figuring out ( which one that is ) , " said one staffer in thursday 's first session			1
" which plans are more pro-life ? " asked another at the second session later in the day			0
in response , insurance company representatives pointed to one multistate plan with @entity74 and all eight plans offered by @entity116			2
more than 100 plans in total are offered to congressional staff			2
those forced into the exchange have just under a month to pick one , starting monday when the enrollment window set by congressional administrators opens .			1

starting monday , congressional staffers will use the @entity7 health care exchanges
some staffers *participated* in two information sessions on thursday
they are concerned about higher premiums , especially for older workers
many also want information on insurance plans that exclude abortion
