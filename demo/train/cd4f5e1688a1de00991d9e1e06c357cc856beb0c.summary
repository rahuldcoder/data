the @entity11 started six years ago in @entity12 , one of at least four places that claim to be the birthplace of the burger			1

@entity123 , a second grade teacher from @entity130 , @entity13 , said her prize is a year 's worth of " bragging rights , " but @entity14 said his contest proves that , " people will do anything for a free t - shirt			2
