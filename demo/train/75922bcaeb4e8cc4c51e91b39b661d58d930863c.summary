-- the head of @entity3 soccer has vowed " to throw the book " at the men charged with match - fixing in a lower league competition -- which has been described as the worst such scandal in the country 's sporting history			1
nine people were arrested on sunday , and six of them were charged in court monday , including the coach of @entity15 team @entity14 , a group of his players and a @entity19 national			1
five of those involved were @entity23 players who had been reportedly been offered to the @entity25 - based club at the start of the season on a non-payment basis			1
the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) website said the arrests were made after it received data on suspicious betting patterns involving the @entity14 in august , which it passed on to @entity36 state police			2
" integrity measures put in place by football have been effective in detecting this activity , " @entity30 chief @entity37 told reporters sunday			0
" from the @entity30 's point of view we 'll initiate proceedings under our own codes of conduct			0
you can be sure that we will throw the book at them			0
" that means life bans on a worldwide basis			0
" police said more than $ 2 million had been bet on the team , which is bottom of its division -- a second - tier competition below the national @entity58			1
@entity59 , 45 , is accused of being the contact man for overseas betting syndicates who organized with the players the outcomes of matches			1
" he receives phone calls			0
he is given advice on how the @entity14 players are to perform , " detective acting senior sergeant @entity68 told the court , according to the @entity71			2
" video showed some of the players were doing some unusually poor play			2
for that work he received payment			0
some of the bets are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars			0
" @entity37 said he had been told by police it was considered an " isolated issue			0
" " this highlights the fact that lower league games , which are n't under the scrutiny of things like a global television broadcast , are potentially more susceptible to this kind of activity , " @entity37 said			2
" at this stage the police have indicated to us that they are looking at an isolated issue in @entity36 and we need to be guided by the police in that regard			2
" the controversy adds to a difficult year for @entity3 sport , which has been rocked by the drug scandals involving leading @entity100 team @entity99 as well as the country 's rugby league competition			1
" this was flagged earlier this year by the @entity107 that there were links with organized crime , trafficking of performance - enhancing drugs and match - fixing , " journalist @entity103 of the @entity104 told @entity0 's @entity105			1
" people were saying there 's no match - fixing in @entity3 sport , and then this comes to light			1
it 's a lower grade competition ... but it 's the exotic betting and the middle - men involved that really sends shockwaves through @entity3 sport			1
" bets from @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 on these local teams			0
i think you 'll find that there are other sports that will be investigated and are under the spotlight as far as the @entity133 is concerned			0
" i do n't think it 's just limited to football in this country			0
this is disturbing for @entity3 sport in general			1
