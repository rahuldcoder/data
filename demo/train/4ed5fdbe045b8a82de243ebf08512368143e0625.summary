watch @entity3 say why he rejected the plea deal Â» the conviction carried a 10 - year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation			1
according to @entity1 attorney general @entity45 , prosecutors in @entity44 , @entity1 , offered @entity3 a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record			1
defense attorney @entity51 said in june that @entity3 rejected the deal because he did n't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15 - year sentence			2
