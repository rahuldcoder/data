@entity0 -- an air traffic controller and his supervisor are under investigation because the controller allegedly brought his two small children into the control tower and allowed them to speak with pilots on an air traffic control frequency			1
the incidents occurred on succeeding days last month at @entity14 's @entity13 , the @entity11 said wednesday			1
both the controller and the supervisor have been placed on paid administrative leave			1
" this lapse in judgment not only violated @entity11 's own policies but common sense standards for professional conduct			0
these kinds of distractions are totally unacceptable , " administrator @entity23 said in the statement			0
" we have an incredible team of professionals who safely control our nation 's skies every single day			0
this kind of behavior does not reflect the true caliber of our work force			1
" @entity23 's statement concerned an incident that took place on february 16 involving the controller 's young son , who is heard in a recording -- posted on liveatc.net -- clearing a @entity44 flight for takeoff and later speaking to an apparent @entity47 flight			1
later , an @entity11 official who asked not to be identified because of the ongoing investigation said the controller brought his daughter into the same tower the following day , and the child was allowed to talk with pilots of two planes			1
a source familiar with the investigation said the supervisor " should be making sure that things like this do n't happen			1
" a separate source familiar with the investigation said the two children are twins			1
the controller and supervisor involved are both veteran employees , the official said			1
but @entity69 owner of the web site where recordings of the air traffic communications are posted , told @entity1 he believes the attention the incident has drawn is " ridiculous " and it has been " blown out of proportion			1
" in one recording , a child can be heard saying , " @entity44 171 , cleared for takeoff			1
" a man is then heard telling the plane , " here 's what you get , guys , when the kids are out of school			2
" the pilot chuckles and says , " wish i could bring my kid to work			2
" the same pilot later tells the child , " awesome job			2
" during the recording , the child also speaks to an apparent @entity47 flight			2
@entity11 spokeswoman @entity95 later said the incident took place about 7:30 p.m. february 16			0
a recording from the following day , when the daughter was reportedly in the tower , was also posted on the web site			0
@entity69 said most people " in the aviation community felt like this was [ not ] anything more than a noble thing , that a father would take his kid to work			2
" and when you listen to any of the recordings , the situation in the tower is very controlled			0
there is no hint ... that anyone was too busy or anyone was interrupting the planes			2
... it was very controlled , and i do n't think safety was compromised , nor should anyone be disciplined for this , " said @entity69 , who is also a pilot			0
the recording was from a network of receivers , he said , but could n't reveal the source			0
the site exists for pilot education , he said , and sometimes other curious parties listen in			0
there was " absolutely no security threat " posed by the incident , he said			0
" i have every belief that they 'd make sure there were additional eyes there , " @entity69 said			0
" only the best of the best work at @entity13 tower , and they are the best at what they do			2
" if you know anything about aviation , you know that the air traffic control towers are highly supervised , " he said			1
" @entity13 is highly supervised			0
it 's not just one controller controlling the runway			2
supervisors are there , and multiple people are there making sure by looking through binoculars and at radar			0
... a father was taking a child to work and let the kid clear planes for takeoff , and now the world thinks it 's an unsafe place			1
" the @entity11 said all unofficial visits to air traffic control operational areas , such as towers and radar rooms , will be suspended during its investigation into the incident			1
@entity23 has directed a team to review air traffic control policies and procedures related to facility visitors			1
the @entity172 , the union representing controllers , said in a statement , " we do not condone this type of behavior in any way			0
" it is not indicative of the highest professional standards that controllers set for themselves and exceed each and every day in the advancement of aviation safety , " spokesman @entity179 said in the statement			0
@entity1 's @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 contributed to this report .			0
