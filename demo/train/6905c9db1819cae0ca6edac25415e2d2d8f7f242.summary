@entity0 -- the @entity2 and @entity3 could play a crucial role in helping finally to resolve the conflict that plagues the @entity6 , says analyst @entity7			1
in one of the most violent incidents in decades , @entity8 shelled a @entity12 island tuesday , killing four people			2
@entity8 accused the @entity12 of provoking the shelling of @entity15 by holding a military exercise in the @entity17			2
and @entity12 responded by charging that the @entity8 's actions were a " definite military provocation			1
" in an interview with @entity1 , @entity7 said a long - term solution to the korean conflict would require high - level secret talks aimed at assuring the government of @entity3 that if the two @entity25 were reunified , it would not be faced with a nuclear - armed @entity2 ally on its border			1
he said @entity3 " has the power to make the @entity8 pay a very , very high price were they not to listen to the @entity3 , because the @entity3 provide the vital food and fuel that keeps the country alive			1
remember , this is a country with almost no indigenous economic activity , and so it would be very difficult for them to meet their most vital supply needs			0
" " the @entity3 have a lot of influence			1
they have so far been very careful to apply some pressure , but they have almost never cut off food or fuel -- except for a day or two when they have really wanted to send a strong signal , and , by the way when they have done that , it 's worked , it gets the @entity8 ' attention			2
" the author and host of @entity1 's " @entity54 " spoke to @entity1 on tuesday			0
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : what 's the significance of @entity8 's actions ? @entity7 : i think it 's very worrying , very troubling			1
combined with the sinking of that @entity12 ship , it is the most provocative thing the @entity8 have done in years in terms of instigating hostilities			2
the regime is unpredictable but ruthless , and we know that the @entity12 are feeling some substantial pressure to respond in some way , and then you have all the other great powers in the region watching anxiously			0
the whole thing has the potential to spiral out of control			0
@entity1 : do you think it 's connected to the succession process in @entity8 ? @entity7 : i think that 's probably the most plausible theory that i 've heard			1
they 're clearly going through a succession process			0
it appears to be one that is fairly complex -- there are different factions that are being accommodated or tussled with			0
sometimes it feels like something out of a @entity93 play where the aging king is appointing his dauphin as the successor , but there will be a regent who will actually administer , and by the way his sister has just been made a four - star general in the army			0
but outside that kind of theatrics what it suggests is that the family is trying to consolidate power , that there is perhaps some opposition in some quarters , perhaps in the military , perhaps in other quarters			0
and by creating an external diversion , the regime is trying to consolidate power and unify the various parts of the government			0
but one has to admit , this is just a theory			0
the regime is a black box ; we have so little contact that nobody really knows			0
@entity1 : there 's been a suggestion by some that @entity8 is really hoping to force the issue about getting direct talks with the @entity2 rather than be part of a six - nation diplomatic process			1
@entity7 : i do n't buy the idea that people send you these signals by killing soldiers , sinking warships , sinking ships			2
if the @entity8 want to talk to the @entity2 , they can ask to talk to the @entity2 , and they could ask to do it within the six - party talks ; they could ask outside the framework ; they could bring that up -- the issue of bilateral talks with the @entity2 in the six - party talks			1
do they really have to kill the @entity12 to make that point ? i think this idea of brutal violence as some kind of sophisticated signaling device strikes me as highly unlikely			0
far more likely is that this is a pretty thuggish regime that is consolidating power by creating external threats and enemies , but we probably should be open to any signs that they do want to have negotiation			0
i myself doubt that this is the moment that they want to do anything			0
they know that that door is open ; the president has a very capable emissary , @entity170 , who is his envoy on this topic , very well - versed in this issue , former ambassador to @entity12 , and my sense is that the @entity8 have not reached out to him			2
@entity1 : @entity170 made a statement that he talked to the @entity3 about this , but it did n't seem like there was any special progress on that front			2
@entity7 : the @entity3 have been pretty helpful on managing the situation , making sure that it does n't spiral out of control , but we have n't been able to get to the next level with the @entity3 , which is to say that the @entity3 sustain this regime			1
the @entity3 provide about 90 percent of their energy and about 40 percent of their food aid			2
it 's pretty reasonable to say that without @entity3 support their regime would collapse , but the @entity3 have legitimate concerns about what the future of the @entity6 would look like if there were a @entity8 implosion			1
there is in their minds the kind of scenario in which @entity8 unifies on the @entity12 's terms and becomes a unified much larger nation sitting on @entity3 's border with @entity2 troops in the unified @entity8 , with an @entity2 security alliance , and by the way with nuclear weapons			1
they would view it as a kind of threatening or destabilizing presence			0
and so i think that is what makes the @entity3 very reluctant to do anything that would cause the regime to implode or cause the regime to start a downward spiral			0
i think what needs to happen at some point , is that the @entity2 and @entity220 need to engage in a very high - level and very secret conversation about the future of the @entity6 -- a conversation in which the @entity2 should make certain informal or perhaps even formal guarantees regarding the role of nuclear weapons on the peninsula and the nature of @entity2 troop deployments			2
... we should make clear that we would denuclearize @entity8 or we would encourage the @entity12 to denuclearize @entity8 , and then we would not move the troops that we have north of the @entity233			0
@entity1 : this is all in the event of a unification ? @entity7 : right , so we make clear that in the event of a unification we understand the @entity3 concern , and we would try to respond to it , without obviously in any way jeopardizing the historical relationship with @entity12			1
unless we have some kind of long - term strategic conversation with the @entity3 about what the future of the @entity6 would look like , they do n't have an incentive to in any way push the @entity8			1
so we 've got to get into a conversation with them to say , " we understand your problem			0
we should talk about those concerns now , and would you be willing to get tough on @entity8 nukes and @entity8 behavior ? " @entity1 : here 's a different view , which some have raised -- what is the @entity2 doing in @entity8 decades and decades after the end of the hostilities , and should the @entity2 stay indefinitely ? @entity7 : well , i think that 's very shortsighted			1
look , i am in general someone who believes the @entity2 is overcommitted around the world			0
i believe we have to draw down and pare back many of our commitments , but i think maintaining a stabilizing role in @entity8 is absolutely crucial			2
the center of power is shifting to @entity269 , and @entity8 is probably the single place in @entity269 where there 's the greatest potential for a war between the great powers -- @entity276 , @entity3 , @entity12 , @entity8 , @entity277 , all get involved in this			1
so for the @entity2 to be able to play a constructive role will be absolutely vital to its ability to be a @entity281 power , to be in what is now the new geo - economic cockpit of the world			1
i think there is a perfectly reasonable case to be made to have us draw down in places like @entity289 , where the threat to @entity2 security is nonexistent , to draw down from @entity292 and the @entity293 to where we have an overly large military presence , but @entity8 is a vital national interest of the @entity2 , and i think that the major players in the region , particularly @entity12 , strongly want an @entity2 presence there .			1

@entity7 : @entity3 has *tremendous* influence over @entity8
he says @entity3 supplies much of the @entity8 's vital supplies and can play a positive role
@entity7 says @entity2 needs to work secretly with @entity3 to bring an end to conflict
he says @entity2 assurances could go long way toward gaining @entity3 ok for reunification
