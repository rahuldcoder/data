-- hundreds of children have been systematically raped , beaten and sex trafficked in a northern @entity4 town for more than 12 years			1
and it is still going on , a government commissioned report says			1
the " appalling " revelations also expose cultural tensions and lack of communication between authorities and the town 's ethnic minorities that may have helped stop it			1
@entity16 counselors saw evidence of sexual exploitation early on , but turned a blind eye , according to the @entity20 into @entity21 in @entity22			1
the city 's government recently made the inquiry 's report available on its website			1
and so the abuses amassed , which included gang rape and death threats at gunpoint			1
at least 1,400 cases of abuse went on between 1997 and 2013 -- a conservative estimate , the report says			1
this year , specialist investigators are handling 51 cases			0
other teams are looking at additional cases			0
opinion : what 's behind sex abuse of 1,400 children torturous sexual abuse the exploitation has reached a level tantamount to torture , according to the report			2
" there were examples of children who had been doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight , threatened with guns , made to witness brutally violent rapes and threatened they would be next if they told anyone , " the report says			2
some victims were not even in their teens			2
" girls as young as 11 were raped by large numbers of male perpetrators , " the inquiry says			1
the report accuses politicians , social services and police of " blatant " failure to stop them , citing an inability to traverse cultural barriers with @entity22 's small @entity73 community			1
fear of label of racism the perpetrators often worked together and were mostly of @entity80 heritage ; the victims were mostly white girls , the report says			1
an earlier report said that " @entity84 " gangs originally were exploiting women and girls " for their personal gratification " but later turned to making money with it , passing girls around			1
@entity16 counselors often took a hands - off approach to the cases for fear of being branded as racists or stoking a right - wing backlash in the city			1
" several ( counselors ) interviewed believed that by opening up these issues they could be ' giving oxygen ' to racist perspectives that might in turn attract extremist political groups and threaten community cohesion			2
to some extent this concern was valid , with the apparent targeting of the town by groups such as the @entity112 , " the report says			2
though known victims were mostly white , the report delved into an underbelly of alleged systematic abuse by select groups of @entity84 men against women in their own ethnic groups			1
these often go unreported , because the victims fear vengeance or public shame in their communities , the report says			1
perpetrators may be using that fear to blackmail these victims into continued sexual servitude			2
@entity130 left out cultural differences also hindered effective involvement with concerned members of @entity22 's @entity80 community			0
authorities turned to male community leaders and imams and greatly left out women			1
many ethnic @entity80 women told the @entity20 that it made them feel disenfranchised and prevented people from speaking openly about abuse			2
members of both genders said they missed any direct engagement on the topic by officials			2
" this needed to be addressed urgently , rather than ' tiptoeing ' around the issue , " the report said			0
under the rug some social counselors also hoped cases they were seeing were one - off occurrences and hoped they would go away			0
that may have been bolstered by the fact that the vast majority of child sexual abusers in @entity158 are white males			0
research reports on the problem began appearing a few years ago , but they had little effect			0
" the first of these reports was effectively suppressed , because some senior officers disbelieved the data it contained , " the report said			0
social services managers downplayed the problem			0
officials thought reports were exaggerated			0
law enforcement gave it little importance			0
" police gave no priority to ( child sexual abuse ) , regarding many child victims with contempt and failing to act on their abuse as a crime , " the report said			1
improvement but frustration by the time awareness of the problem increased by 2009 , thinly staffed social service workers were overwhelmed by the number of potential victims			0
there has been a marked improvement in training police to recognize sexual abuse and work together with social services , the inquiry says			0
" but the team struggles to keep pace with the demands of its workload , " according to the report			0
and finances are running low			0
and still , few cases even make it to court .			0

abuses included gang rape , trafficking , beating , threats at gunpoint
victims were as young as 11 years old , the report says
@entity16 counselors , police , officials turned a blind eye , report says
most *suspects* were ethnic minorities , and authorities were *afraid* of being branded racists
