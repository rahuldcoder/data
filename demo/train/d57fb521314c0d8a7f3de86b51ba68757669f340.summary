president @entity0 is the first @entity1 president known to have authorized the assassination of a @entity1 citizen			1
on september 30 , 2011 , @entity4 , a @entity1 citizen by virtue of his birth in @entity7 in 1971 , was killed by an @entity1 drone in @entity9 along with another @entity1 citizen , @entity10 , who grew up in @entity11 and @entity12 , @entity13			1
@entity14 had played an operational role in @entity17 's affiliate in @entity9 , @entity18 -- for instance , tasking the " underwear bomber , " @entity21 , to bring down an @entity1 airliner over the @entity1			2
@entity21 attempted to bring down @entity23 over @entity24 on christmas day 2009 , but luckily his underwear bomb did n't detonate correctly			0
@entity10 had played more of a supporting role for @entity18 as the editor of the group 's online magazine , @entity28 , which has inspired a number of terrorists , including the two brothers suspected of bombing the @entity33 last year			0
the killings of two @entity1 citizens by a @entity1 drone without a judicial process caused considerable outrage on both the left and the right			1
since then there has been far more public discussion of the secretive drone program , both by @entity1 government officials , including president @entity0 , and at public hearings about drones in @entity48			1
but will @entity4 and @entity10 be the last @entity1 to die in a @entity1 drone strike ? @entity1 officials are now debating whether to kill with a drone another @entity1 citizen who is part of @entity17 and believed to be plotting attacks against the @entity1 , a senior @entity1 official tells @entity56			1
the @entity57 first reported this development but is withholding the name of the targeted individual			0
there has been speculation but no confirmation about who the individual might be			0
at least a couple of other @entity1 citizens or permanent residents are known to play important roles in @entity17 today			1
one name that has been mentioned in media reports is that of @entity72 - born @entity71 , who for the past decade has operated as a leading @entity17 propagandist			0
in 2006 @entity71 was the first @entity1 charged with treason in more than half a century			0
however , there is , at least so far , no public information that @entity71 has played an operational role in @entity17 's terrorist plots , and therefore it is unlikely that he would be placed on a " kill list , " unless his role in @entity17 has changed of late from propagandist to operational planner			0
according to a senior @entity1 administration official , @entity71 is not the subject of the ongoing high - level discussions about whether a new name should be added to the kill list			0
in a letter to the @entity91 in may 2013 , @entity1 attorney general @entity89 laid out the legal rationale the government uses to determine if an @entity1 citizen can be killed in a drone strike			1
in the letter , @entity89 said that based on @entity97 decisions during @entity98 , merely being an @entity1 citizen does not make one " immune from being targeted			1
" @entity89 also asserted that an @entity1 who poses an " imminent threat of violent attack against the @entity1 " and is in a location where capture " is not feasible " could be killed			2
@entity89 explained that @entity4 " plainly satisfied all these conditions " as he had recruited the underwear bomber and instructed him to blow up an @entity1 airliner " when it was over @entity1 soil			2
" @entity14 was also killed in a remote part of @entity9 where a @entity1 ground operation to capture him was deemed unfeasible by the @entity0 administration			1
there is a certain irony in @entity89 's legal reasoning			0
the @entity114 was monitoring @entity4 's e-mail account for years before he was killed			0
to monitor his e-mail , the @entity114 had to get a court order			0
yet the decision to target @entity4 for death was made without any kind of judicial proceeding			2
as @entity122 , a former assistant general counsel for the @entity123 , nicely put it a year before @entity4 was killed in the drone strike , " @entity4 's right to privacy exceeds his right to life			1
" @entity10 was killed in the same drone strike that killed @entity4 , but according to a senior @entity1 official , that was unintentional and was merely a byproduct of @entity10 traveling in the same car as @entity4 when the drone strike occurred			2
in sum , @entity10 's role as the editor of @entity28 magazine was not enough to put him on a kill list			0
when it comes to targeting a @entity1 citizen for death , @entity1 officials , by their own account , will make particular efforts to determine how dangerous an @entity17 operative that person really is			1
in the eyes of many @entity1 , however , a decision to kill one of their own should also be subject to judicial review .			2

@entity158 : @entity1 officials reported to be considering targeting an @entity1 citizen
he says @entity0 authorized killing of @entity4 by @entity1 drone in @entity9
attorney general said @entity1 citizens are n't immune to attack , put forth *criteria* for these cases
@entity172 : many @entity1 would argue such a decision requires review by courts
