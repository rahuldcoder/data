-- the case of a 13 - year - old @entity3 girl strip - searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain - reliever will be heard by the @entity7 @entity6 this week			1
the @entity6 has a mixed record when it comes to students ' rights			0
the justices in january accepted the @entity14 case for review , and will decide whether a campus setting gives school administrators greater discretion to control students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed in cases involving adults in general public spaces			1
the case is centered around @entity26 , now 19 , who in 2003 was an eighth - grade honors student at @entity28 , about 127 miles from @entity29 , @entity3			1
@entity30 was strip - searched by school officials after a fellow student accused her of providing prescription - strength ibuprofen pills			1
the school has a zero - tolerance policy for all prescription and over-the - counter medication , including the ibuprofen , without prior written permission			1
" in this case , the @entity6 will decide how easy it is for school officials to strip search your child , " @entity40 , an attorney with the @entity41 who is representing @entity30 , told @entity0 on sunday			1
@entity40 told @entity0 his client was traumatized by the search			0
" school officials undoubtedly have difficult jobs , but sometimes they overreact -- and this was just a clear overreaction , " he said			0
@entity30 was pulled from class by a male vice principal , escorted to an office , where she denied the accusations			0
a search of @entity30 's backpack found nothing			0
then , although she never had prior disciplinary problems , a strip search was conducted with the help of a school nurse and @entity65 's assistant , both females			0
according to court records , she was ordered to strip to her underwear and her bra was pulled out			1
again , no drugs were found			0
in an affidavit , @entity30 said , " the strip search was the most humiliating experience i have ever had			0
i held my head down so that they could not see that i was about to cry			0
" at issue is whether school administrators are constitutionally barred from conducting searches of students investigated for possessing or dealing drugs that are banned on campus			1
a federal appeals court found the search " traumatizing " and illegal			0
some parents say older children deserve the same constitutional rights as adults , but educators counter a school setting has always been treated differently by courts , and a ruling against them could jeopardize campus safety			1
while a federal magistrate and a three - panel appeals court found the search was reasonable , the full 9th @entity94 ruled in favor of @entity30 last year			1
" common sense informs us , " wrote the court , " that directing a 13 - year - old girl to remove her clothes , partially revealing her breasts and pelvic area , for allegedly possessing ibuprofen ... was excessively intrusive			1
" the court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug - and crime - free classroom			2
" the overzealousness of school administrators in efforts to protect students has the tragic impact of traumatizing those they claim to serve			0
and all this to find prescription - strength ibuprofen			2
" in its appeal to the @entity6 , the school district said restrictions on conducting student searches would cast a " roadblock to the kind of swift and effective response that is too often needed to protect the very safety of students , particularly from the threats posed by drugs and weapons			2
" school officials said the court was " wholly uninformed about a disturbing new trend " -- the abuse of over-the - counter medication by teenagers			2
the high court has a mixed record over the years on students ' rights			2
in a famous 1969 ruling , the justices said students do not " shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate			2
" but decisions in the 1980s gave administrators greater discretion , including one case that said officials need not be required to have a warrant to search a student 's locker			1
such a search was permitted if there were " reasonable " grounds for believing it would turn up evidence and when the search was not " excessively intrusive			0
" opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes , and those participating in other extracurricular activities			0
and in a well - publicized 2007 ruling from @entity168 , the @entity6 upheld the suspension of a student who displayed a large " @entity172 " banner at an off - campus , but school - sponsored , event			1
the decision did not endorse a broader argument that students in general have limited free - speech rights when they interfere with a school 's vaguely defined " educational mission			2
" the court could now be asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches , and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over			1
the case is @entity26 ( 08 - 479 ) .			0

the justices in january accepted the @entity14 case for review
justices will decide if campus gives administrators greater discretion
administrators strip - searched honor student , 13 , looking for ibuprofen
the court could now be asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches
