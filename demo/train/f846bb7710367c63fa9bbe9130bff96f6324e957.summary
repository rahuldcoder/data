-- @entity1 , the last surviving @entity3 giant tortoise , has died at his home in the @entity6			1
scientists believe he was more than 100 years old			2
staff at the @entity9 in @entity10 say @entity1 , the only remaining member of his subspecies ( @entity12 ) , was found dead by his long - term keeper , @entity13			2
in a statement the national park said @entity13 had been " unhappily surprised " to discover his charge " stretched out in the direction of his watering hole with no signs of life , " on sunday morning			0
a post-mortem examination will be carried out to ascertain the cause of death , as although he was old by human standards , @entity1 was not considered old for a giant tortoise -- the animals can live to around 200 years of age			1
photos : a study of mass extinction @entity1 became a symbol of the @entity6 after he was found on @entity3 by biologist @entity33 in 1971			1
his plight as the only known member of his subspecies led to a series of ill - fated attempts to provide him with a mate			0
but despite the best efforts of conservationists -- and the presence of two female giant tortoises from a close subspecies sharing his enclosure at the @entity48 on @entity49 -- @entity1 remained a solitary creature			1
his death marks the end of the purebred @entity3 tortoise , but there is hope that they will survive in some form : at least one first - generation descendant of the subspecies has been found at the @entity60 on neighboring @entity61			2
genetic testing has been carried out to try to find further hybrids among the population there			0
the giant tortoises of the @entity6 helped @entity67 formulate his theory of evolution after he visited the islands in the 1830s , on his five year voyage aboard @entity73			0
at the time , the super-sized reptiles were common , but the introduction of wild goats , which ate the vegetation that formed their diet , and the hunting habits of passing sailors -- left them on the brink of extinction .			0
