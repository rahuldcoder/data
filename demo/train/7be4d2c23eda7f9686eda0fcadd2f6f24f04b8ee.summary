editor 's note : this is the first in a series of planned collaborations between @entity5 and the online investigative journalism organization , @entity6			0
@entity7 grew impressively under ceo @entity8			1
he says he was forced out for favoring slow growth			1
@entity10 , @entity11 ( @entity5 ) -- sitting back in his leather chair , working as a consultant for a small @entity15 bank , @entity8 is sure of one thing : practically anyone , he says , could have made money as a banker in the go - go days of real estate in @entity11			2
go - go days that lasted until the fall of 2008			2
" it did n't take a rocket scientist to run a bank in this town for the past 10 years , " @entity8 told @entity5			2
@entity5 's @entity26 and the online investigative journalism organization @entity6 got a brief look inside the collapse of a regional bank			2
what the two organizations learned was both old and new : bankers giving themselves large salaries and generous bonuses , at the same time they are lending millions of dollars on what , according to one lawsuit , were essentially parcels of bare dirt with little potential of big income			2
@entity7 had been in business in the @entity15 suburb of @entity44 for 10 years when @entity8 , the bank 's founder and ceo left			1
the bank had grown impressively under his guidance , but @entity8 said his managers wanted more and he was forced out			1
" they wanted bigger salaries , bigger lifestyle , fancier offices			0
however you want to view that , " @entity8 told @entity5			0
one of those managers was new bank president @entity58 , who declined to answer any questions			2
three other managers declined comment to @entity5 , as well			0
@entity7 and others loaned money on the promise of @entity15 ' commercial real estate boom with the belief that undeveloped land would be turned into shopping centers , hotels and offices			1
records show that land and houses were being " flipped " or resold over and over at huge profits			0
@entity75 , a @entity15 banker who once worked as a regulator for the @entity77 in @entity78 , said what was happening to @entity7 was clear			1
" they were over-advancing on construction , you know , more liberal advances on construction , " @entity75 said			0
" it all worked last year [ and ] the year before and the year before			0
so they just kept doing it			0
" banking regulators issued repeated so - called " mild " warnings to banks concerned they were amassing large amounts of commercial development loans and lowering lending standards			1
but @entity75 says those warnings -- delivered by @entity97 personnel often on a quarterly or semi-annual basis in their field visits to @entity7 -- were ignored			1
one @entity7 loan that turned out to be especially poor was to a @entity15 developer who had been a longtime customer of the bank			1
according to bank records , a developer named @entity104 , received almost $ 100 million from @entity7 during a 10 - year period			1
in 2008 , @entity104 came calling again and the bank approved a $ 24 million loan for a piece of ground in @entity111 far from the @entity113 strip , supposedly valued at $ 48 million			1
it was a so - called " interest reserve loan " in which the bank not only loaned the principle amount but the interest , as well			2
then , according to bank records , it booked the interest as revenue			2
regulators say those sorts of deals are not uncommon in construction loans			2
but this particular piece of land was undeveloped with only a permit to build a casino there one day			0
it is near the @entity131 and in court papers the developer said he hoped a casino could be built			0
however , the entire project was scrapped before a spade was ever turned , and the land sits empty surrounded by a fence			0
the project was scrapped because @entity7 went under			1
@entity138 , the man who made that loan , reluctantly agreed to sit down with @entity5 for a taped interview			0
he is now vice president at a @entity141 think tank in @entity143 , @entity144			0
@entity138 told @entity5 that at " the time " he believed the land was " very valuable			0
" but when it all went up in smoke , he says , " it 's very humbling , believe me			0
" @entity138 says mistakes at @entity7 were " preventable , " but according to a lawsuit filed by the developer , the loans were part of a series of loans , each one preceding the other -- to different corporations			1
at the time @entity138 left @entity7 , the bank told reporters he had resigned for " personal reasons			1
" but @entity138 told @entity5 he was fired from @entity7			1
according to @entity163 documents , he sold $ 1.8 million in @entity7 stock from november 2007 through february 2008			1
that was on top of his $ 650,000 in salary and bonuses , according to bank records			2
he left the bank in march 2008			1
in september 2008 , when @entity7 collapsed , a group of elderly @entity15 deaf residents was especially hurt			1
the local chapter of the @entity174 put an estimated $ 400,000 into certificates of deposit sold by @entity7			1
that money was to be used to help fund the group 's annual national convention in @entity15 in 2009			0
the group lost half of its money			0
the @entity97 said after it seized @entity7 that it did not have enough capital to cover business activities			1
" i just ca n't believe it happened , " one woman told @entity5 through a sign language interpreter			0
" we 're just so frustrated			0
" the group is trying to raise funds in a more traditional manner by making quilts			0
they have a very long road ahead , its members say			0
@entity7 was the 25th bank to fail in the @entity194 in 2008			1
as a result , the @entity97 was left to cover more than a half - billion dollars in @entity7 liabilities			2
already this year , three @entity194 banks have collapsed and experts predict many more will tumble as the economy continues to suffer .			0

bank ceo says he was forced out for favoring slow growth , not being *powerhouse*
former regulator : @entity7 ignored repeated warnings from banking regulators
@entity7 one of *27* that failed in 2008 ; many bankers believe 2009 will be worse
