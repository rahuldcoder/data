-- an atm transaction , a grocery store receipt , a gps device planted by a concerned car dealer and videos -- including one that showed a 22 - year - old woman manhandled , knocked to the ground , then forced into a car just blocks from her @entity11 home			2
all of it , among other tips and pieces of evidence , added up			0
and because of that , @entity16 is thankfully back in @entity11 where she belongs			1
the 22 - year - old nursing assistant was released early thursday from @entity20 's @entity19 , having been reunited with her family after a harrowing three days			1
" she 's doing about as well as you can expect			2
obviously , she 's traumatized by the entire event over the past few days , so it 's going to take a little time for that to heal			2
but she 's doing well			0
she 's back with her family and she 's very , very happy about that , " @entity11 police commissioner @entity26 told @entity0 's " @entity28			0
" " she had injuries , but nothing life threatening , fortunately , " he said			0
the man who authorities say abducted her , 37 - year - old @entity34 , has a new home himself , at a detention center in @entity37 , @entity20			1
according to a criminal complaint , @entity34 admitted to the kidnapping			1
he also reportedly said he did n't know the victim before he took her			2
appearing at a court hearing later thursday from jail via video conference , @entity34 waived his extradition to @entity45 where he faces grave charges in another abduction case			1
that leaves @entity45 authorities five days to pick him up			1
@entity20 judge @entity50 did n't set bail , due to the severity and number of charges in @entity45			1
it 's not clear when @entity56 will be arraigned in the @entity11 case , though it seems unlikely he 'll be free when that happens			0
but at least his alleged latest victim , @entity16 , is			1
@entity11 police commissioner @entity26 says that 's because of " a lot of police work , a lot of tips from the public			0
but we were able to track it down			0
" @entity69 , the victim 's cousin , told @entity0 affiliate @entity71 on thursday that @entity16 is " in good health			1
" " @entity73 was on our side			0
everybody was praying for us and prayer works , " she said			0
and the victim 's mother , @entity78 , could n't be happier or more thankful			2
as she said wednesday night to law enforcement , the media and the public , " thank you for keeping me up			0
thank you for being there for us			0
i 'm taking my baby home ! " abducted @entity11 woman found alive in @entity20 taken after visiting godson on sunday , @entity16 went to the house of her mother 's godson , her aunt @entity94 said , and took a bus toward home			1
after she was dropped off in @entity11 's @entity103 - @entity102 area around 9:40 p.m. , the suspect 's car passed her , turned up the street , then met her at an intersection , @entity11 police chief inspector @entity97 told @entity0 sister network @entity106			0
it was then that her abductor pounced			0
surveillance video shows @entity16 being confronted by a man , then forcibly led away by him , tussling on the ground before being forced into a car			1
during the struggle , her glasses and cell phone fell to the road			0
@entity16 kept fighting -- even breaking out one of the passenger side windows -- but she could n't stop the car from speeding away			1
abductions are hardly unprecedented , but @entity26 said it is rare to see one captured on video			0
" i 've been on the job 46 years , ( this is the ) first time i 've ever seen a kidnapping on videotape			0
( it ) really was horrific to watch it unfold			0
" police : car dealer provided key tip this was n't the only video that police released			2
another , from just after 6 a.m. monday , shows a man in a dark hooded jacket using @entity16 's atm card at a machine in @entity139 , @entity20 , which is about 75 miles from @entity11			1
and on wednesday , police released an additional video of a man , also wearing dark clothing , making a purchase at a convenience store on monday			0
someone who sold a car to @entity34 recognized him from one of the videos and alerted authorities			1
the dealer had placed a gps device in the vehicle because of worries about @entity34 ' bad credit , according to @entity156 capt. @entity155			1
" from that , we were able to trace the car , " @entity26 said			0
" we were able to then contact @entity159 ( @entity45 authorities ) , ... and things started really falling into place very quickly			1
" such devices are put in cars to alert customers if they 're behind on payments and , if they do n't pay on time , allowing dealers to shut down the vehicle and track it down , said @entity170 ceo @entity169 , the head of the company that made the unit			2
in this case , @entity34 knew it was there			1
@entity170 has about 1.5 million such units out on the road , but has been only asked by law enforcement 10 to 15 times to track them as part of a criminal investigation , according to @entity169			2
he said that the car dealer worked with authorities earlier this week , with the @entity170 headquarters getting involved thursday morning			0
in the @entity45 case , @entity34 is charged with abduction , forcible rape , malicious wounding with a chemical and other charges related to the early october disappearance of a 16 - year - old girl , according to @entity155			1
that girl managed to escape after two days , walking 2 miles naked and burned into a business seeking help			2
like the case involving @entity16 , authorities believe that case was a stranger abduction , meaning the victim did n't know who took her			1
" we used to chill , hang out			0
he 's a good guy , " a friend of @entity34 told @entity0 affiliate @entity203 about the suspect			1
" i do n't believe it ... he is always looking to help somebody , always looking to bend over backwards			2
he 'll give the shirt off his back if he could , " @entity209 said			0
suspect allegedly abducted , raped , burned girl the travels of @entity34 ended wednesday night in @entity214 , @entity20			1
" we surveilled that vehicle in the area , " @entity216 agent @entity215 said of the car @entity34 is thought to have used in @entity16 's kidnapping			1
" ... when the subject exited the vehicle , that 's when @entity225 ( @entity16 ) was recovered			2
" @entity0 's @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			0

@entity239 , 22 , is " doing about as well as you can expect "
@entity34 admitted to the abduction , according to a criminal complaint
he waives extradition to @entity45 , where he faces other charges ; no bail set
@entity16 was found 3 days later in @entity20 ; @entity34 did n't know her
