-- neither the @entity1 nor the @entity3 finals kept moviegoers out of the theater this weekend as a pair of box office newcomers both opened strong			1
" @entity13 " was the big winner , grossing an estimated $ 60 million its opening frame — a massive 65 % higher than the original 's $ 36.3 million in 2012			1
the bumbling cop duo of @entity15 and @entity16 turned in the second - highest - grossing opening weekend for an r - rated comedy , ranking just below " @entity18 " ( $ 85.9 million ) , but besting both " @entity19 " ( $ 54 million ) and " @entity20 " ( $ 57 million )			1
" @entity23 " brought the heat as well , with an estimated $ 50 million opener			1
that 's 14 % above the original 's opening gross of $ 43.7 million from 2010			1
the well - reviewed film from @entity28 also earned an @entity29 from audiences and should hang on well as families flock to the movies over the next couple of weeks			0
in third place " @entity37 " only fell 45 % despite the arrival of the dragons			1
the re-imagined fairy tale , which did n't score too high with critics but resonated with moviegoers , now has a three - week cume of $ 163.5 million			0
it even topped last weekend 's two debuts , outgrossing the @entity44 - starrer " @entity49 , " which lost only 44 % of its traffic in its sophomore session , coming in at an estimated $ 16 million			1
( the film 's strong reviews have surely helped it hold its value			2
) that puts its two - week total at an estimated $ 56.6 million			0
then there 's last weekend 's top earner , " @entity57 , " which saw its ticket sales drop by 67 %			1
it earned an estimated $ 15.7 million for a 10 - day total of $ 81.7 million			0
" x-men : @entity65 " landed outside of the top five this weekend , yet with an additional $ 9.5 million , it surpassed the $ 200 million mark			2
@entity66 is the big winner this weekend , with three of the six top movies belonging to the distributor			2
in limited release the @entity70 , @entity71 - starrer " @entity72 " performed strong , grossing $ 14,000 per theater for a $ 70,000 cume , proving that @entity70 is a draw outside the " @entity78 " franchise			2
that said , the real test will come next weekend when distributor @entity81 expands the film nationwide			2
here is how your top five looks this weekend			2
22 jump street — $ 60 million 2			0
@entity23 — $ 50 million 3			1
@entity86 — $ 19 million 4			0
@entity49 — $ 16 million 4			0
@entity57 — $ 15.7 million despite this being only the fourth time the box office has had two films grossing more than $ 50 million in their debuts , the overall yield was down 7 % compared to the same weekend last year , when @entity93 had a $ 116.6m debut and this is the end bowed to $ 20.7m			1
yet the strength of these two openers ( 22 jump street also scored well with audiences , earning an @entity99 ) coupled with minimal drop - off from previous weeks ' releases has done a lot to keep the summer box office happy and healthy			0
the year - to - date total is up 3 % from last year			0
