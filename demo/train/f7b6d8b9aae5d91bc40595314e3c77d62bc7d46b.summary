@entity0 -- on the day he shot president @entity3 , 25 - year - old @entity2 left in his hotel room a letter addressed to young actress @entity6 , with whom he was infatuated			1
the letter began : " @entity8			0
there is a definite possibility i will be killed in my attempt to get @entity3			2
" see letters @entity2 sent to @entity6 but on march 30 , 1981 , @entity2 survived			2
his gun empty after he fired six shots at the president in less than two seconds , @entity2 was tackled by police and secret service agents			2
he was rushed away and all but disappeared into custody for the past three decades			0
on wednesday , a federal judge will begin a week and half of hearings on whether @entity2 eventually should be released from the mental hospital where he has been a patient since his 1982 trial ended in a jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity			1
doctors at @entity29 , a federal mental facility in @entity0 , have petitioned the court for approval to grant @entity2 convalescent leave if all goes well in series of extended visits to his mother 's home			1
@entity2 is now 56 , his hair turning gray			0
in the last court hearing two years ago , @entity40 district judge @entity39 acknowledged hospital doctors ' testimony that his mental problems were in remission			1
the court has steadily granted @entity48 greater freedoms over the years			0
the government 's response for the hearing describes @entity2 as " a man capable of great violence " and argues that there are still concerns " that this violence may be repeated			1
" his mother , @entity56 , a widow who is now 85 but in good health , lives in a gated resort development near the @entity59 in historic @entity60 , @entity61			0
@entity2 has been allowed several visits in recent years			0
a next - door neighbor , signing as @entity64 , wrote a month ago in a letter to the editor of the local newspaper , @entity67 , that upon moving in during the 1980s , mrs. @entity56 phoned to say that " they would never bring @entity2 to @entity60			1
" yet , the letter writer said , @entity2 had been allowed to roam the streets alone on long walks during those recent visits			2
@entity2 's proposed release , the writer concluded , " is not terribly reassuring to me living next door			1
" much of the eight - day hearing will involve contrasting testimony from psychiatrists on either side , as did @entity2 's trial			1
@entity2 did not testify then , and whether he will do so this time remains in dispute			0
the @entity40 attorney 's office has told the judge that if @entity2 does take the stand at the hearing , it wants the right to question him			1
@entity2 's lawyer , @entity88 , replied that @entity2 will testify only if the judge does not allow any cross-examination			2
the hospital motion for @entity2 's eventual release was filed under seal , unavailable to the public			1
however , in answering that , the government said the motion proposes a series of eight new visits of 17 to 24 days each to @entity2 's mother 's home			1
after that , the government said , the hospital wants " the sole discretion to place @entity2 on convalescent leave " and to do so " without any further review by this court			2
" no immediate decision is expected during the court hearing			0
in the past , the judge has taken some time before issuing a written ruling			0
@entity2 came within an inch of killing @entity3 : that 's how close the last bullet came to penetrating the president 's heart			1
the president lost half his blood supply as his left lung was flooded			0
had the @entity122 not gotten @entity3 to a hospital within minutes , doctors said , he might well have died			2
watch agent show where bullets struck the presidential limo @entity2 wounded a police officer , a @entity122 agent and press secretary @entity129 before his sixth and final shot ricocheted off the presidential limousine and struck @entity3 beneath his left armpit as agents shoved him into the back seat of the vehicle			1
@entity129 , shot in the head , survived against the odds but was so severely injured he was never able to return to his @entity139 duties			0
@entity2 had left numerous letters and notes for @entity6 , a freshman at @entity142 , after seeing her in a breakthrough role as a child prostitute in the movie " @entity146			0
" one of his last notes , shoved under her dorm door a few weeks before he shot @entity3 , echoed a line from that movie : " just wait			1
i 'll rescue you soon			0
" the day after the shooting , @entity6 said she did not even know who @entity2 was .			0

letter by mother 's neighbor expresses *unease* about possible release
after @entity2 shot @entity3 , he was found not guilty by reason of insanity
hearing may determine whether to eventually free him from mental hospital
@entity2 doctors : he 's in remission ; federal doctors : he 's " capable of great violence "
