the @entity1 's main north - south road runs right on the edge of @entity3			1
for now , it remains nothing more than a narrow dirt track and @entity3 , the country 's largest park , very much remains one of the world 's last isolated natural @entity9			0
but @entity11 , head of the park 's anti-poaching unit , knows that is quickly changing			2
for the past year , @entity11 has been gathering evidence of @entity17 involvement in ivory poaching , carving and trafficking right along the very same road			1
he now suspects that the global trade that ends in the markets of @entity24 is more entrenched in this remote corner of @entity26 than many could have ever imagined			2
" we 've had many stories that involve local poachers and @entity17 , but to get the @entity17 you have to find them with the ivory , " he said			1
@entity11 's focus has been the dozen or so @entity17 construction camps that dot the road			1
for the last five years , the @entity17 state - owned @entity37 ( @entity37 ) has been under contract to turn the road into a paved highway			1
but without actually finding the ivory in the hands of @entity17 nationals , @entity11 has largely been unable to make any arrests and unable to convince authorities to follow any of his leads			1
the @entity48 checkpoint , manned by @entity11 's eco-guards , remains the park 's link to the outside world , making it a crucial location to @entity55 ' anti-poaching efforts			2
@entity55 , a non-profit group , runs @entity3			2
on a morning in which the unit had already tracked down and arrested two suspected poachers , one of the guards entered the gatehouse with even bigger news			2
" we got ivory , with the @entity17 ! " he shouted to @entity11			1
@entity11 bolted outside to the vehicle just as the @entity1 driver lunged for the guard holding the ivory			1
" do n't move , do n't move ! " @entity11 shouted , shoving the driver up against the car			0
grabbing the carved ivory ring , he questioned the passengers -- two @entity17 nationals			1
a brief interrogation confirmed what @entity11 had already suspected			0
the car was coming from one of the @entity17 construction camps , @entity76			1
a month ago , the @entity55 eco-guards had one of their biggest busts to date , detaining two @entity17 nationals with two ivory tusks in their possession			1
they were based at the same camp , @entity76			0
at the time , it was enough for @entity11 to get the local prosecutor to go to the camp with him			0
they found small pieces of ivory scattered on the ground among the pebbles just outside one of the buildings			1
but rather than being allowed to search the premises , the prosecutor ordered the unit to leave			0
when asked about the incident , the prosecutor told @entity96 the search was halted because the translator for the @entity17 was away and they could n't conduct a search without explaining to the @entity17 why it was happening			1
@entity11 is convinced the camp runs an underground ivory carving workshop and that generally speaking , the @entity17 workers in the country are funding and fueling the ivory trade			1
the @entity17 camps that lie along the highway are also located right next to small villages that have always had a history of poaching			1
now , @entity11 suspects it 's getting worse			0
" they ask everybody to get them ivory			2
so you can imagine a villager and once a day a @entity17 asks him -- do you have ivory ? what will he do , this man ? of course he will become a poacher			1
" last year , his unit busted a poacher with three @entity123 who was working on airport construction in the northern city of @entity126			2
" i asked him to call the dealer , and he called him in front of me , and the @entity17 man on the phone said that he has a lot of ammunition and a weapon , " @entity11 said			1
it was the first time that he had heard of a @entity17 national bringing ammunition to a poacher			1
the minister of forest economy and sustainable development , @entity138 , said he had not noticed an increase in poaching activity since the influx of @entity17 nationals to the country			1
but if any are found to be involved in the illegal trade , they will be prosecuted , he said			1
" we do not want the @entity17 to be a factor in the illegal activities of elephants ... but those who stray away , break the law , will be punished			1
" as for the failure to search the @entity76 camp , he said it must have been a matter of incompetence			0
back at the checkpoint , the carved ivory ring was yet another link to the @entity76 camp , one that @entity11 was determined to take advantage of			2
in the bag where the ring was found are a computer and a pack of cigarettes			2
one of the @entity17 , an @entity168 - speaking manager , denied it was his , and said he did n't know who owned it			1
" ok , you smoke , your cigarettes are inside this bag and it 's not your bag ? " @entity11 demanded , calling his guards to handcuff the men			0
on the drive to jail , the @entity168 - speaking boss continued to deny he had any information about the ring or ivory moving through @entity185 camp			2
when they reached the jail , the @entity17 camp manager and others are already waiting			2
the @entity168 - speaking boss then said it was his employee who was the owner of the illegal ivory			2
his worker signed a written confession in @entity195 , a language he does not speak			0
the @entity197 says @entity24 's insatiable demand for ivory has almost wiped out @entity26 's elephant population			0
according to @entity197 data , the illegal ivory trade has tripled since 1998			1
the @entity203 , @entity203 , a non-governmental wildlife protection organization , works closely with the government but also puts pressure on it to fight corruption and initiate and follow through with arrests			1
" no network can function without corrupt authorities , " explains @entity209 , @entity211 coordinator			0
" from corrupt authorities in the ports where this stuff is being shipped out of all the way to the people facilitating the trade down in the forest , people turning a blind eye , collecting a little bit of a bribe to let a poacher pass with a gun			2
" @entity138 admits , " there are those who are not working correctly			0
" the minister said the government has plans to create a joint committee to fight internal corruption			0
according to the government , there has been an increase in arrests and seizures			0
" it 's because of the increase in activity , " the minister said			0
" why ? because of the international bosses , they are using all means to access these resources through our people , our criminals			0
yes , now we need stronger forces , stronger powers to try and stop this phenomena			0
" in the span of one week in november , @entity203 teamed with @entity1 authorities to carry out four operations in the capital @entity254 , arresting eight people			1
those included a dealer with sculpted ivory and a @entity17 national who was attempting to board a flight with ivory jewelry after bribing his way through			1
but a 10 - hour drive away , in one of the areas from which the ivory could be coming , @entity11 still does n't have enough evidence to make any more arrests			0
after their employee signed the confession and was charged with possession of the ivory ring , the @entity76 camp @entity37 bosses agreed to allow @entity11 's team to search the camp , in an effort to diffuse the growing tensions			0
but the next morning , @entity11 did n't expect to find anything			0
his informer had told him where the ivory should be located , but there was a disturbing update			0
" this informer told me there was a lot of activity at night ... maybe they took off all the ivory from the camp this night , " @entity11 said			0
the @entity17 managers were cooperative , allowing @entity11 and his team full access			2
but they are hardly equipped to search the sprawling facility or the forest around it			0
" this white powder , what is it ? " @entity11 asked , holding up a tool he found in a back room			0
it 's to carve wood , the managers said			0
he 's certain that the connection between this remote corner of @entity26 and the ivory markets of @entity24 is stronger than ever .			0
