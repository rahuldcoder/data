-- when she was 12 , @entity2 's hands were red and raw from washing them so much			2
she 'd start scrubbing a half an hour before dinner ; when she was done , she 'd hold her hands up like a surgeon until her family sat down to eat			2
her handwashing compulsions began at the time she was studying for her @entity11			2
she was so worried about being exposed to pork fumes that she cleaned her shoes and barrettes in a washing machine			2
" like a lot of people with @entity18 , i tended to obsess about cleanliness , " said @entity2 , now 42			2
" but because i was reading various @entity21 portions , i was obsessed with a biblical definition of cleanliness			2
" family dinners were awkward for @entity25 , too , as an adolescent			2
she would concentrate so hard on praying for forgiveness that if anyone tried to interrupt her thoughts , she would n't respond			2
" first i had to get rid of all my sins , ask forgiveness , do it in the right way , and then i had to pray for protection , " said @entity25 , now 50			2
" or , if something bad happened to my family , it would be my fault because i had not prayed good enough			2
" the women come from different faith backgrounds : @entity25 is methodist and @entity2 is @entity40			2
but as children they believed fervently that they needed to conduct their own rituals and prayers , or else disaster would befall their families			2
both women say they suffered from a form of obsessive - compulsive disorder known as scrupulosity			1
a fear of sin or punishment from deities characterizes this condition , said @entity56 , professor and associate chairman of the department of psychology at the @entity60 , @entity61			1
@entity18 , or @entity18 , involves unwanted thoughts ( " obsessions " ) and accompanying behaviors called compulsions that patients use to reduce anxiety			1
in scrupulosity , the obsessions have a religious or moral underpinning			1
patients with scrupulosity often describe how they believe their thoughts are morally equivalent to actions , @entity56 said			1
psychologists call this phenomenon " thought - action fusion			2
" " @entity78 literally means ' fearing sin where there is none , ' " @entity56 and colleague @entity82 wrote in a recent article			2
how common is this condition ? @entity78 is an understudied subcategory of @entity18			1
attempts at characterizing how many people might have this disorder , from the 1990s and early 2000s , suggested that somewhere between 5 % and 33 % of @entity18 patients have religious obsessions			1
scientists are not sure what causes @entity18 , but they believe a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be at play			2
in societies where religiosity is more stringent , the numbers are higher : 50 % of @entity18 patients in @entity100 and 60 % in @entity101 said they had religious obsessions , according to studies from the early 1990s			1
a small number of people with scrupulosity are not religious at all , and a fear of moral transgression or inadvertently offending others weighs on their conscience , @entity56 said			1
psychologists do not believe that religion causes people to develop @entity18			0
however , religion may influence whether someone with @entity18 experiences obsessions and compulsions related to religion , @entity56 said			1
a tendency to get anxious and difficulties with uncertainty may factor into the condition , @entity56 said			1
and , he pointed out , the vast majority of religious people do not have @entity18			1
many " scrupulous " people @entity56 has met consider religion to be an important part of their lives , but they may avoid institutions such as churches , synagogues or mosques because it reminds them too much of their anxieties			0
" they 're walking around with this black cloud of ' i 'm going to hell , ' " @entity56 said			0
such a cloud has been been present for centuries			0
the @entity135 cites passages from the first century priest and essayist @entity139 and sixth century monk @entity140 that could be interpreted as descriptions of scrupulosity			1
@entity143 of @entity144 , founder of the @entity146 , who died in 1556 , appears to have suffered from the condition , said @entity149 , professor of psychology at @entity151			1
@entity152 wrote about his fears about stepping on something that looked like a cross			0
there have also been suggestions that @entity158 experienced scrupulous obsessions , @entity149 said			1
@entity160 , a retired @entity161 minister , runs an online support network called the @entity163			1
he said it has about 1,000 members , including @entity166 of several denominations , @entity40 , and at least one @entity168 and one @entity169			0
@entity160 , who has suffered from scrupulosity personally , offers pastoral advice , but also tries to help people overcome their distrust of their own judgment			1
" i think that 's really a major part of it : to get to the point where people form their own consciences and do n't rely on other people 's , " he said			0
did i do it right ? @entity78 often involves a lot of checking , @entity56 said			0
@entity187 experience distress around the idea that they may have done something wrong or improper , so they may consult the @entity190 or religious authority figures often to see if they 're doing things right			1
consulting people and books is n't pathological , but in scrupulosity the behavior of checking is excessive compared to other religious people			1
@entity25 often confessed bad thoughts to her parents or religious leaders			1
feelings of guilt followed her for years			0
" @entity18 makes you think in black and white , " she said			0
" there are no gray areas			0
there 's nothing in between			0
" @entity25 attended a religious school run by evangelical @entity166			1
the altar calls , when the devout are asked to come forward and commit to @entity213 , heightened her anxieties about being good enough			0
she was also taught that if she had unforgiven sins , @entity215 could not hear her			0
her obsessions took a toll on schoolwork , too			1
texts were difficult to read without reviewing the same passage over and over , a problem people with other forms of @entity18 experience			0
@entity2 did n't have a complete @entity40 education ; she invented her own prayers to say three times a day , until a rabbi taught her the actual words			0
rather than fearing sin , which has a distinct meaning in @entity233 , @entity2 was worried she would be punished if she did n't practice her religion correctly			0
" i could n't have put my finger on what the punishment would be , " she said			0
" just a sense of doom			0
" when the space shuttle challenger exploded in 1986 , killing the crew of seven , @entity2 felt partially responsible			0
her @entity18 flared up around ages 12 to 13 , and again from 16 to 17			0
with a @entity166 mother and a nonpracticing @entity40 father , living in rural @entity243 , @entity2 did n't have many models of what @entity247 could look like without constant anxiety about botching rituals			0
learning how to doubt in a healthy way the form of cognitive behavioral therapy used with scrupulous patients is called exposure therapy			1
this involves the patient confronting what he or she fears : namely , uncertainty			1
some people @entity56 has worked with are anxious that they sometimes doubt their own belief in @entity215			0
in therapy , they practice learning to live with the faith and uncertainty that normally surrounds religious beliefs			1
" this is done by helping the patient to experience these types of uncertainties and learn that they , like any other religious person , can live with them comfortably , " @entity56 said			1
triggers of obsessive thoughts , such as a religious symbol or scriptural passage or even going to church , would be part of therapy			1
" faith is about being comfortable with your beliefs even if you ca n't have a 100 % guarantee about things like hell , whether there is really a @entity215 , or what it means to be faithful enough , " @entity56 said			0
" you 're taught to have faith , even though you can not have scientific proof			0
" keeping up religious traditions can be another source of anxiety			1
ultra-religious @entity298 , for instance , follow strict rules about separating milk from meat , and some consider this tenet so sacred that they have separate refrigerators for meat and dairy			0
some people with scrupulosity develop anxieties around this rule , going as far as to avoid the milk refrigerator altogether while carrying meat			1
in exposure therapy , the patient might walk past the milk refrigerator while holding meat to confront her fear , @entity56 said			1
that does n't violate @entity40 law , but confronts the fear of using the wrong refrigerator by mistake			0
some patients may also receive @entity322 , drugs that are also used to treat depression , according to the @entity324			1
treatment sessions are usually once a week , between 12 and 20 times , or five days a week for three weeks , @entity56 said			0
members of the patient 's faith community may be involved in the treatment , too			0
religious but without @entity18 overcoming scrupulosity does not need to mean giving up religion			1
@entity160 left the @entity334 at age 19 in part because of his ocd , but returned in his mid- 20s , and was inspired to go to seminary at age 31			1
he came to realize that faith is partly about letting go of the idea that any individual can control all circumstances or prevent every tragedy			0
" the process of coming back to the church was as much a part of the recovery as the therapy was , " he said			1
@entity25 got a diagnosis of @entity18 at age 26			0
she still slips into anxiety occasionally , but therapy has given her tools to fight back			1
rather than trying to stop her obsessions , she imagines her thoughts flowing like a river , and takes deep breaths			1
she runs a blog called " bringing along @entity18			2
" @entity2 did talk therapy , but not specifically for @entity18			2
she overcame her thought and behavior patterns in college , when she had to live with others her own age and feared being socially ostracized			0
she wrote a book discussing her experiences called " @entity368			2
" today , she identifies with a blend of @entity370 and @entity298 , and has a 3 - year - old son and a 5 - year - old daughter			0
her daughter ca n't read prayer books , but she 'll announce " i have to go say my prayers ! " and invent a chant			0
@entity2 knows @entity18 has genetic links			0
she 's also grateful that there 's greater awareness and more treatment options for this condition than when she was a teen			2
if her daughter 's prayer antics ever turn obsessive , she said , " we 're on that right away			0
" @entity324 : @entity385 follow @entity386 on @entity387 at @ lizlandau			0
