-- with the promise of coming @entity4 vaccines , former president @entity1 urged the world 's nations monday not to give up on funding to prevent a calamity			1
overall support for global @entity4 efforts from donor nations flattened amid last year 's global economic crisis , according to a recent analysis of 2009 funding levels from the @entity14 and the @entity15			2
@entity1 spoke with @entity0 's @entity16 at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19			1
" if we all do this , the consequences will be calamitous and you 'll spend more money later , " @entity1 said , referring to reduced donations			1
" you 'll start having large numbers of people dying again , you 'll have more political instability , more economic collapse , and it 's going to cost us more money later			1
so it 's not only going to be a humanitarian crisis			2
you 'll pay now or pay later			2
so if it 's at all possible , hang in there , " he said			2
after years of disappointment , researchers have finally found a potential basis for an hiv vaccine			1
scientists at the @entity41 say they have discovered three human antibodies that neutralize more than 90 percent of the current circulating @entity39 - 1 strains			0
" there is a preliminary indication that sometime in the next two to three months , we 'll get some reports on vaccine tests , which are very hopeful for the quick development on a vaccine that actually works , " @entity1 said			1
" meanwhile , we know that if you start people on the medicine not when they have full - blown @entity4 , but as soon as their so - called @entity57 blood count drops below a certain amount , it can prevent 90 percent of @entity4 , " he said			0
" that 's about as good as a vaccine			1
it 's not 100 percent , but if we could just do that , this whole epidemic would be in a different place in five years			0
" when asked about the affordability of such medicine in poor countries , @entity1 said cost should not be an issue			1
" in most places , the donors are providing this medicine , " he said			0
" you should be able to get that help right now because i have negotiated great contracts for this medicine all over the world			0
and if you ca n't , you need to get in touch with us directly , and i 'll try to make sure it happens , because in any poor country , people should n't have to pay anything for it			0
" @entity39 / @entity4 is the world 's leading infectious killer , according to the @entity85			0
the disease accounted for an estimated 2 million deaths in 2008 , and more than 33 million people are living with the disease worldwide			0
the researchers say the findings put them one step closer to their goal , and among their next steps are plans to make sure other people -- not just those infected with @entity39 -- can create these types of antibodies			0
they also want to figure out how to be able to potentially mass - produce more " broadly neutralizing " antibodies to block nearly all @entity39 strains in the future			0
@entity1 said the @entity102 has increased contributions to @entity4 programs , but not as much as hoped			1
" it 's not enough , but there are serious budget constraints in the congressional process , " he said			0
" i think the president did what he thought was the best he could do			1
" @entity1 said that money must be spent to " make good things happen			1
to give people a chance to live their dreams			0
" " we should n't be penny wise and pound foolish in an interdependent world where we worry all the time about terrorism , we worry all the time about violence , " he said			0
" when president @entity123 's and @entity102 's approval went way down all over the world because of the @entity126 war , " he said , " there were three places where it did n't go down : in @entity130 , where we made a deal for peaceful nuclear cooperation ; in central and eastern @entity133 , where we continued my policy to expand @entity135 ; and in the 10 countries of southern and eastern @entity137 where @entity138 [ the @entity102 president 's @entity138 ] was concentrated and the highest aids rates were			1
" did they agree with president @entity123 's @entity126 policy ? no. ... they thought he and the @entity102 cared whether their children lived or died			2
" @entity1 said nations have many ways to help			1
" i would like to see all the other countries that started their cutback a year before we did do the same kind of soul - searching and ask themselves what 's going to happen , " he said			2
" i also think that since the economy 's coming back , it may be that everybody should consider making clear that over a two - to three - year period , they will give three years ' worth of money			2
... there 's a thousand ways to work this out			0
