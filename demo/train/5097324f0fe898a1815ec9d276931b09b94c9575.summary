@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 on monday fired more projectiles into the sea off its east coast , @entity1 officials said , urging @entity8 to refrain from " tension - creating acts			1
" but @entity8 described the launches as a " regular military exercise			1
" the @entity12 still needs to analyze exactly what the @entity13 has been firing for the past three days , said @entity15 , an official in the ministry representative 's office			2
they could be short - range missiles or a new kind of large - caliber artillery rocket , the ministry said			1
the @entity13 fired three projectiles into waters off its east coast saturday and a fourth sunday			2
it fired two more monday , @entity15 said			0
the short - range launches have n't so far caused major concern in @entity0 or @entity27			1
@entity3 last fired this kind of projectile as recently as march , @entity1 said			0
nuclear weapons : who has what ? accusations of escalation the office of @entity1 president @entity37 said monday that the @entity13 " should not engage in tension - creating acts , " @entity35 reported			0
a government statement carried monday by the @entity13 's state - run @entity41 described the activities over the weekend as " rocket launching drills			0
" it said the @entity1 's reaction to them was " another unpardonable challenge			0
" " their description of the drills as a factor of escalating the tension on the peninsula and in the region reminds one of a thief crying , ' stop the thief ! ' " the statement said			0
this month 's launches come after @entity8 last week criticized the presence of a @entity61 nuclear - powered aircraft carrier in a @entity1 port and its reported participation in joint naval drills			1
the stop in @entity68 by the @entity69 and its strike group signified a move " to escalate the tension and ignite a nuclear war against " @entity3 , the state - run newspaper @entity65 said in a commentary last week			2
also last week , @entity3 announced that @entity74 , a @entity61 citizen it had sentenced to hard labor , had begun his stay at a " special prison			1
" @entity74 , whom the @entity3 call @entity79 , was arrested in november			0
the @entity13 says he wanted to bring down @entity81 's regime , but the @entity61 and his family say he was just a tour operator			2
@entity3 is considered to have one of the most repressive penal systems in the world			0
human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent			0
before last week , tensions in the region had eased from a period in march and april that included near daily @entity3 threats of war against @entity1 and the @entity61			1
@entity61 and @entity1 officials feared at that time that @entity81 's regime was planning to carry out a test launch of longer - range ballistic missiles , believed to be @entity103			1
the @entity1 government says @entity103 have a maximum range of 3,500 kilometers ( 2,175 miles )			0
@entity3 's missile capabilities missiles or artillery ? on monday , @entity12 spokesman @entity109 said it remained unclear exactly what the @entity13 has been firing over the past few days			1
" there is a possibility that the projectiles are either short - range missiles or large - caliber rockets with a similar trajectory as short - range missiles , " he said at a regular news briefing in @entity0			1
@entity1 suspects that @entity3 is still developing large - caliber rockets and is n't yet capable of deploying them , @entity109 said			1
that could mean the @entity13 's recent launches are tests of the weaponry			0
" large - caliber means bigger destructive power , so the threat can be greater , " he warned			2
@entity129 , a journalist and author based in @entity0 , said over the weekend that @entity3 's short - range launches should not cause the same degree of concern as the launch of a satellite or medium - range @entity136 missile			1
" it 's a short - range tactical weapon			1
if any other country launched this kind of weapon , it 's a routine test , nobody would be too worried			0
it 's really simply because it 's @entity3 doing this that it raises concerns , " he said			0
@entity1 officials have n't so far said any of the projectiles were aimed at the @entity152			0
tensions on the @entity156 flared in recent months after the @entity13 's long - range rocket launch in december and underground nuclear test in february , both of which were widely condemned			1
@entity8 's fiery rhetoric intensified in march , when the @entity160 voted to tighten sanctions on the regime after the nuclear test			0
annual @entity61 - @entity1 military drills in @entity1 also fueled the @entity13 's anger , especially when the @entity61 carried out displays of strength that included nuclear - capable @entity169 stealth bombers			1
@entity3 is demanding recognition as a nuclear power , something the @entity61 refuses to accept			2
