-- @entity2 medical staff were putting @entity4 ' life at risk by leaving him on the field after he suffered concussion at @entity8 , the former head doctor at @entity10 has told @entity0			1
dr @entity11 , the first team doctor at the @entity13 side between 2009 and 2010 , believes @entity2 's medical staff erred in their treatment of the @entity16 at @entity17			1
" i do n't want to be critical of the doctor in question but this is a time to reflect because next time , we have to ensure we get it right , " said @entity11			2
@entity4 suffered concussion after being accidentally hit in the head by the knee of @entity8 striker @entity27 late in the game , with play held up for nine minutes as he received treatment			1
to widespread surprise , @entity4 -- who could not remember the incident after the match -- was allowed to continue after saying that he wanted to stay on the pitch			1
both world governing body @entity35 and the global players ' union @entity36 criticized the decision - making progress employed by the @entity2 staff , who say they followed procedure when assessing the state of the @entity42 captain			1
" once the relevant tests and assessments were carried out we were totally satisfied that he was fit to continue playing , " @entity43 said on the club website			2
local @entity50 rules state that any player who leaves the pitch with a head injury should " not be allowed to resume playing or training without the clearance of a qualified medical practitioner " even if such an injury is sustained in training			2
@entity2 's medical staff have come under fire for their actions , which come 18 months after they were widely praised for saving the life of visiting @entity64 player @entity63 , whose heart stopped beating during a game at @entity67			1
nonetheless , @entity11 is unhappy with the way in which @entity4 was treated on the pitch , saying the goalkeeper was allowed to move too freely before a more comprehensive treatment had taken place			1
" @entity4 could have died , he could have been paralyzed , " said @entity11			2
" if knocked out with a head injury , he should have been carried off the pitch -- but first and foremost , they should have checked his spine			0
" " he needed to have a collar put around his neck , blocks applied to either side of his head , to have been strapped in and then a spinal board placed underneath him in order to determine any injury to his cervical spine			0
" after declining to specifically address @entity11 ' assertions , @entity2 referred @entity0 to the earlier statement made by @entity88			1
on monday , the @entity89 , the body that looks after the welfare of footballers in @entity93 and @entity94 , called for a change in the rules surrounding head injuries			1
" if anyone suffers a severe trauma to the head and loses consciousness , then they should be required to leave the field of play automatically , " said @entity89 deputy chief executive @entity98			0
@entity106 after the match , @entity2 manager @entity107 said he had taken the final decision to send @entity4 back onto the pitch following consultation with his medical staff			1
for @entity11 , such an admission lies at the heart of a weakness he believes exists within the game			0
" the problem is that no one knows who 's boss at present on such an issue , " he said			2
" traditionally , it has been the physiotherapist but does he know more than the team doctor ? if you go to hospital , it 's not the nurse but the doctor who ultimately looks after you			1
a physio has fewer qualifications			0
" i strongly believe that the doctor should be the team leader above both the manager and referee			0
he has to be strong enough to make that crucial decision , because at the end of the day it 's not about the club , it 's about the doctor looking after the player			0
" if i had been in the same situation , i would have ordered @entity4 ' removal from the pitch , telling all concerned that if they did n't like my decisions , then they could fire me in the coming days			0
" @entity36 backed @entity11 ' viewpoint on the chain of command in a statement which called the decision to keep @entity4 on the pitch ' unacceptable '			2
" @entity36 condemns that the health and safety of players are let to coaches / trainers or even to players themselves , " said the body 's medical advisor @entity152			0
" medical professionals should be aware of any relevant medical guidelines and apply them in order to empower the health and safety on the field			0
the health and safety of the players should be the number one priority and should prevail against any other matters			0
" the issue of concussion has become a major talking point in sports such as rugby and the @entity177 in recent times			0
three months ago , the @entity177 reached a settlement worth $ 765 million with 4,500 former players who sued the organization over claims it hid the potential impact of concussion - related injuries			2
in rugby , dr @entity186 -- the uncle of @entity188 star @entity187 -- quit his seat on the @entity191 's medical committee in protest at a new method of dealing with head injuries			1
new guidelines stipulate that a player can return to the pitch five minutes after injury if a medical inspection entitled the @entity200 determines he has not been knocked out			0
once upon a time , the rules stated that a player had to wait three weeks before returning to the fray			0
@entity4 was given less than ten minutes in a clattering that so badly damaged @entity27 's knee the @entity8 striker was forced off the field			1
earlier this season , @entity27 was praised for finishing a game against @entity210 despite suffering a concussion himself when scoring late on -- a difference in media coverage that @entity43 fans may point to when considering the outcry over @entity4 .			1
