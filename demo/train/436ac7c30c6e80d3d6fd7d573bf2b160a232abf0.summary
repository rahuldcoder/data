-- truck driver @entity1 has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in connection with the crash last weekend that killed comedian @entity10 and injured comedian @entity11			1
the question has arisen : why was he charged with death by auto and aggravated assault before we even know how he was driving ? in this sort of crash , what makes the difference between an accident and a crime ? the answers lie in the criminal code			1
homicide @entity1 has been charged with " death by auto " in connection with the killing of @entity10			1
in @entity29 , homicide as a crime is divided into three different categories : murder , manslaughter and -- in a category by itself -- death by auto. vehicular homicide is causing a death by driving a vehicle or vessel " recklessly			1
" there are two elements hidden in that definition			0
first , causation : the defendant has to have caused the death			2
it must be shown that the defendant caused the crash , the crash caused the death , and that the victim 's death was foreseeable			1
the concept of recklessness , however , is a little more difficult to grasp			0
recklessness and negligence are often spoken of together , but they are two very different points on a " mens rea " ( state of mind ) spectrum			2
criminal negligence is the least blameworthy state of mind			2
it 's an " objective " standard , which means that we simply ask if an ordinary , reasonable person would have done the same act -- the act that created the risk in the first place			2
the prosecution does n't have to prove that the defendant actually knew better , just that he should have known better			0
both the negligent person and the reckless person create a risk of bodily injury , but the reckless person does so in conscious disregard of that risk			1
so , the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant 's driving created a substantial and unjustifiable risk of bodily injury			1
with recklessness , the state must also prove that the defendant consciously disregarded this risk , which was a gross deviation from what a reasonable person would have done			1
so how on earth does a prosecutor get into a defendant 's brain to know what he was thinking at the moment of impact ? the truth is that we never know for sure what a defendant actually thought -- unless , of course , the defendant tells us what he thought			0
often defendants give statements or admissions to the police that can be introduced against them in court			0
while it 's true that hearsay ( what the person told someone else ) is supposed to be inadmissible , the admission of a criminal defendant is an exception to this rule			0
of course , if a confession is obtained through compulsion or coercion , it is considered unreliable , and is inadmissible			0
but , as long as the state can prove conclusively that a confession was made voluntarily , it will be admissible			2
but how often does a driver admit to police " i drove recklessly ? " not often			0
therefore , the law also permits us to draw inferences about a person 's state of mind , based just on their conduct			1
in fact , certain behavior is specifically considered reckless by the law			2
and that 's where this defendant may find his words come back to haunt him -- even if he never uttered the words " reckless " to the police			2
@entity29 's criminal code has this to say : " [ p ] roof that the defendant fell asleep while driving or was driving after having been without sleep for a period in excess of 24 consecutive hours may give rise to an inference that the defendant was driving recklessly			1
" the easiest way to find out a driver was dozing off is if he admits it			0
since the defendant in this crash was alone , only he would be able to tell police if he was asleep			2
even an offhand comment to investigators about " drifting off " would have dire consequences , because it all but establishes a major part of the case against him			0
the 24 - hour alternative could be proved with circumstantial evidence , such as records , communications , or even witness testimony			0
either way , the state would have the burden of proving sleep			0
if the defendant admits to dozing off , he 's saved the state the inconvenience of its burden			0
see why criminal defense attorneys are always begging clients to not try to talk their way out of trouble ? this kind of homicide is a second - degree offense , punishable by up to 10 years in state prison , and there is a presumption of incarceration			1
this means if he 's convicted , he 's probably going to prison			0
assault @entity1 has also been charged with " assault by auto " in connection with the other injuries caused			1
assault by auto also has the recklessness standard , but here the seriousness of injury also guides the degree of the crime charged			1
assault by auto is a crime of the fourth degree if serious bodily injury results			1
on the other hand , if only " bodily injury " results , it is only a disorderly persons offense			0
it 's interesting that criminal statutes define culpability in part by the injuries suffered , but in this case , the " seriousness " of the bodily injury -- @entity11 was left in critical condition , for example -- is apparent , which is why the state has charged @entity1 with a fourth - degree offense			1
this is punishable by up to 18 months in state prison			0
ultimately , for both assault and death by auto , the prosecution must prove reckless behavior beyond a reasonable doubt			1
if @entity1 made statements or admissions to the police about falling asleep at the wheel , those statements could dramatically alter the course of the prosecution against him , potentially conceding a major part of the state 's case against him .			0

@entity243 : trucker in @entity11 crash charged with death by auto , assault by auto
in @entity29 vehicular homicide from reckless driving
he says state must show conscious disregard of risk
@entity243 : assault charge defines culpability based on *severity* of injuries
