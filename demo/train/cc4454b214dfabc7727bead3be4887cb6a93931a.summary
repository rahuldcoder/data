@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 said wednesday that his decision to remove himself from the @entity5 investigation into a leak that led it to surreptitiously collect telephone records from the @entity9 leaves him unable to respond to questions about it			1
" i do n't know what happened there with the intersection between the @entity9 and the @entity5 , " @entity2 told the @entity12			1
" i was recused from the case			0
" the news agency revealed monday that federal agents had secretly collected two months of telephone records for some of its reporters and editors			1
the @entity9 said agents were apparently investigating the source of a story revealing that the @entity27 had thwarted an @entity29 plot to blow up a @entity31 - bound jetliner in may 2012 , around the anniversary of the killing of @entity34			1
@entity9 blasts feds for phone records search sources later told @entity1 that the operative who was supposed to have carried the bomb had been inserted into @entity29 's @entity41 affiliate by @entity43 intelligence , and that the device had been handed over to @entity31 analysts			1
@entity2 told the hearing that he had recused himself to avoid any potential conflict of interest in the case and had left the decision to subpoena the phone records to deputy attorney general @entity52 , who authorized the subpoena			1
" i recused myself because i thought it would be inappropriate and have a bad appearance to be a person who was a fact witness in the case to actually lead the investigation given the fact , unlike mr. @entity52 , that i have a greater interaction with members of the press than he does , " @entity2 said			1
asked what made him a fact witness , he said , " i am a possessor of the information that was ultimately leaked			0
and the question then is who of those people who possessed that information , which was a relatively limited number of people within the @entity5 , who of those people , who of those possessors actually spoke in an inappropriate way to members of the @entity9			1
" asked who else had access to the information , @entity2 cited the ongoing nature of the investigation			2
" i would not want to reveal what i know and i do n't know if there are other people who have been developed as possible recipients or possessors of that information during the course of this investigation , " he said			2
" i do n't know			0
" answers like those prompted some sharp criticism of @entity2 and his deputy from @entity96 @entity95 rep. @entity95 , a former @entity97 chairman			2
" there does n't seem to be any acceptance of responsibility in the @entity5 for things that have gone wrong , " @entity95 said			1
" now may i suggest that you and mr. @entity52 and maybe a few other people go to the @entity105 and take a picture of the thing that he had on his desk that said ' the @entity109 ? ' because we do n't know where the buck stops , and i think to do adequate oversight , we better find out and we better find out how this mess happened			2
" and a @entity114 , @entity116 's @entity115 , said the subpoenas appeared to be " overly broad in scope			0
" " hopefully that is something that the investigation that takes place will examine with close scrutiny , " he said			0
" and second , that i think , as many of my colleagues have expressed , i 'm also troubled by the fact that the negotiation or consultation with the @entity9 did not occur in advance of the decision to issue the subpoenas			2
" @entity2 said he recused himself because he had been questioned by @entity130 agents as part of the leak probe			1
he tuesday that the leak , which he did not describe , had put @entity31 at risk and demanded " very aggressive action			0
" but @entity9 executive editor @entity136 said tuesday that the records collected by the investigation cast a " very broad net " and involved @entity9 operations " that have , as far as i know , no particular connection to the story that they ( federal authorities ) seem to be investigating			1
" " we 've never seen anything along the size and scope of this particular investigation , " she told @entity1 's @entity145			0
in all , the @entity9 says , federal agents collected records involving more than 20 phone lines -- including personal lines -- used by about 100 journalists in @entity116 ; @entity155 , @entity156 ; and @entity0			1
the @entity5 on tuesday defended its decision to subpoena the records , saying the requests were limited and necessary			1
" we are required to negotiate with the media organization in advance of issuing the subpoenas unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation , " @entity52 wrote in a letter to the @entity9 " we take this policy , and the interests that it is intended to protect , very seriously and followed it in this matter			2
" @entity171 spokesman @entity170 said @entity171 officials were not involved in the investigation and knew nothing about the @entity9 inquiry			2
the @entity177 administration has launched several high - profile leak probes , leading to the prosecution of two government employees accused of revealing classified information			1
@entity182 , a former @entity183 official , was sentenced to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service in 2011 , while former @entity27 officer @entity186 was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting to identifying a covert intelligence officer			0
in 2002 , @entity190 sen. @entity189 criticized the @entity5 for its subpoenas of @entity192 , an @entity9 writer who had written about an investigation into then - sen. @entity194 , @entity195			1
the subpoena also spurred a protest from the journalism association @entity199			0
documentary filmmaker @entity200 , whose movies have criticized the war in @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 , called the administration 's pursuit of leakers " an effort to silence and scare whistleblowers , and to get the press to be quiet and do what it wants them to do			0
" " this is a systemic , continuing problem , " said @entity200 , whose latest film , " @entity215 , " focuses on the issue			0
" it 's not a one - off , and it 's not an accident , sadly			0
" @entity1 legal analyst @entity221 said monday that the subpoenas were likely legal , but they go further than previous administrations in pursuing private information of journalists			0
" i have never heard of a subpoena this broad , " @entity221 said			0
@entity1 's @entity227 reported from @entity0			0
@entity1 's @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
