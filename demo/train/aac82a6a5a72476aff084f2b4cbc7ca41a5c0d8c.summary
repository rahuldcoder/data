@entity0 -- a pile of red , white and blue blankets on the cold , linoleum floor			2
this is how @entity7 's 20 - year old son had been sleeping since returning to live with his mother nearly two weeks ago			1
a family with a past -- @entity11 has served time in prison and her son is a recovering methadone addict			1
@entity11 sees her child 's return as a second chance			1
she did n't want him sleeping on the floor , but she did n't know where to turn			2
sitting on @entity11 's back porch recently , her neighbor had an answer : @entity24			1
@entity25 is an organization that utilizes social media such as @entity27 , @entity28 and blogs to streamline the donation of food , clothing and furniture to people in need			1
the name is a short way to say " you be the remedy for someone in need			2
" the neighbor , who previously received clothing for her six children , reached out to @entity25 on behalf of her friend			2
" we were just sitting out back and i was explaining about my son coming home , and i do n't remember how the conversation come about no bed but she said , ' i know somebody that might be able to help you , ' " @entity11 recalls			1
@entity24 tweets the need @entity54 is a charming 26 - year - old with a background in new media marketing			1
he founded @entity25 in 2009 , after flooding washed over parts of @entity0 , in order to get items such as baby formula and diapers to people in need			2
" everyone i 've ever met in my entire life wanted to help other people ; they just did n't know where to start , " @entity54 says			0
" we thought , ' what would this city look like with 10,000 people getting a text message at the same time of needs in their community ? surely people would want to help with that			0
" the process is simple : @entity78 receives needs from nonprofits , school social workers and individuals looking for help directly on @entity84			1
@entity78 and a team of four volunteers use @entity87 to communicate about what needs they will accept or deny			2
once a need is determined , a member of the team is assigned as case manager and writes a blurb about the story			0
@entity78 blasts out the write - up on @entity27 and @entity28 with a link back to the full story on @entity25 's site			1
" we 're putting a story behind it			0
we say maybe this is a single mom who needs a bed , maybe it 's a middle school kid who needs a pair of shoes , but you know the story			2
you may not know the exact individual , but you know the story and you feel like you 're connected and you know exactly where it 's going , " @entity54 says			0
the person 's last name is omitted to protect confidentiality ; the donor and the recipient will never meet			0
social media week founder @entity127 , speaking at @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126 last week , says while doubters often dismiss the scope of social media , smart organizations are using this software in transformational ways			1
" for me , it 's putting it on a spectrum , " @entity127 says			0
" on one end of the spectrum you have dogs on skateboards , people talking about their lunch and the other end of the spectrum you have the uprising in @entity147 , right ? so two ends of a spectrum but created by the same single medium which is real - time communication , this network that @entity27 provides			1
" hairstylist @entity152 responded with a mattress and box set for @entity11 within 15 minutes of @entity78 's post			1
" it 's the things that we might think we do n't need and the things that we might consider trash is someone 's treasure , and i love that they can put your things in the hands of those people , " @entity152 said			0
so when @entity78 and fellow @entity25 volunteer @entity169 , arrived with @entity11 's new mattress on saturday , march 12 , mom had tears in her eyes			0
" i do n't know anything about a computer , i do n't know how to text or anything like that , so , you know , i 'm amazed at technology and just you know ... somebody helped me that did n't even know me			0
i had a need and it was met , and it 's people who care			0
