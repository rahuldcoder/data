-- deep - sea explorers say they have solved " one of the greatest mysteries in naval history " with the discovery of what was " the world 's mightiest and most technically advanced warship " when it sank in 1744			1
the @entity10 sank in 1744			1
the @entity10 -- the predecessor to a historic @entity13 flagship of the same name -- was found " far from where history says it was lost , " @entity15 said in a news release monday			1
the find in the @entity19 exonerates adm. sir @entity20 , one of " the greatest admirals in @entity23 history , " because it shows that the ship went down in a violent storm , not due to any mistakes he made , @entity15 said			1
it did not specify the ship 's exact location			2
maritime lore said the ship went down in the northern part of the @entity33 , south of @entity23 near the coast of @entity35			1
stories about treasures -- including gold -- that may have been on the ship have existed ever since its disappearance			0
this @entity10 was a predecessor to the historic @entity13 ship that took the same name and which served as admiral @entity46 's flagship in the @entity47 in 1805			1
in court papers seeking exclusive salvage rights , @entity15 says the wreck site " consists of cannons and other unidentified objects			1
@entity15 believes that potentially valuable cargo may be located at or near the site			1
" the papers were filed in @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , where @entity15 is based , seeking exclusive salvage rights			0
there were nearly 1,000 people aboard -- " 900 sailors , plus a complement of marines and 50 volunteers drawn from the noblest families of @entity23 , " @entity15 said in information about the ship released together with the @entity67 , which chronicled the find			1
based on reports from the time , there may be as much as four tons of gold on the ship , odyssey and the @entity67 said			0
" additional research indicates that there were large quantities of both silver and gold coins aboard			0
... research suggests that this prize money will also likely be located at the wreck site			1
" ... however , no coins have been located at the site to date , and no accurate assessment as to their value can be made prior to location , recovery and analysis			1
" the potential treasure also comes in another form -- bronze weaponry			0
" the site 's anticipated ordnance collection " includes " the single largest collection of bronze cannon in the world " and " the largest consignment of bronze guns ever manufactured and preserved today , " @entity15 said			2
two cannons have been recovered -- " a 12 - pounder featuring the royal arms of @entity104 " and a " 42 - pounder bearing the crest of @entity106 , " it said			0
" the huge 42 - pounder recovered is the only known example of a gun of this type and size currently in existence on dry land			0
the only other artifacts recovered to date were two small brick fragments that were brought into @entity116 federal court in order to file an admiralty arrest of the site			2
" @entity121 arrest is a step mandated under international maritime law			0
the discovery could set up a legal battle with the @entity13 government			1
if it really is the @entity10 , " her remains are sovereign immune , " the @entity13 @entity127 ( @entity128 ) said in a statement on its blog monday			1
" the wreck remains the property of the @entity135			2
we have not waived our rights to it			0
this means that no intrusive action may be taken without the express consent of the @entity13			1
" in its statement , @entity15 said it " has been cooperating closely " with the ministry , and " all activities at the site have been conducted in accordance with protocols agreed with @entity128 and @entity149 officials			2
" the ship has deteriorated to the point that recovering it is impossible , @entity15 said			0
" a plan is being developed for an archaeological excavation of the site , and artifacts will be recovered in accordance with a scientific project plan , which will be submitted to the @entity128 for review and approval			2
" the company has proposed that it be paid " with either ... a percentage of the value of the collection that has been recovered , conserved and presented to the @entity13 government , or a percentage of the coins or other artifacts that the government decides to ( sell )			1
" the ship was found nearly 100 km ( 62 miles ) " from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the @entity33 , " @entity15 's statement said			0
" having discovered it in deep water far from where history says it was lost has served to exonerate admiral @entity20 and his officers from the accusation of having let the ship run aground on the @entity181 due to faulty navigation , " said @entity174 , @entity15 's chief executive officer , in the statement			1
@entity15 said the " prevailing belief " about the ship 's fate was that it had " smashed into the @entity181 , a group of rocky islets " north of @entity188 , the second largest of the @entity33			0
but the evidence , @entity15 's statement said , suggests " the ship sank as the result of a violent storm and suggests that the design and construction of the ship contributed to her loss			2
" @entity15 released press materials about the ship in cooperation with the @entity67 , which chronicled the find and will be showing it in a program this week called @entity203			2
" the @entity19 is a treacherous place to navigate , " @entity67 president @entity204 told @entity0			0
" the ship was returning from @entity207 and got caught up in a storm			0
and despite being judged unsinkable at the time , sort of like the @entity210 was , this very , very large ship went down in a storm and vanished without a trace			0
" @entity0 's april @entity213 contributed to this report			0

if find is *confirmed* , it could set up a legal battle with the @entity13 government
