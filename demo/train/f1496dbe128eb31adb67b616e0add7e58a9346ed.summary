-- does " @entity5 's " love affair between a dominant man and vulnerable young woman feel a tad bit familiar ? it might if you 're a tried and true fan of the " @entity9 " series			1
welcome to the world of fan fiction , where fans tweak or add to existing series , novels and characters -- oftentimes with a steamy twist			1
by now you 've probably heard about the best - selling e-book " @entity5 , " which was released in paperback tuesday and will soon come to life on the big screen			1
the novel has readers , primarily grown women , clutching their e-readers under the covers , among other places			2
" @entity5 " has been such a hit that @entity27 and @entity26 reportedly shelled out $ 5 million for the rights to @entity30 ' titillating trilogy , which many sites are referring to as " mommy porn			1
" and while the early " @entity9 " novels were decidedly chaste ( at first , anyway ) , writers of fan fiction will tell you there 's a huge desire for erotic novels			1
fan fiction grew popular in the 1960s thanks to " @entity42 " as fans developed their own story lines to swap with other devotees			2
and the genre has flourished , allowing fans to adapt beloved stories and tailor existing literature to fit their own preferences , said @entity52 , an @entity53 professor at @entity54 and founding board member of the @entity56			2
that 's exactly what @entity30 did with " @entity5 , " which drew inspiration from the insanely popular series by @entity61			1
@entity5 and @entity5 are loosely based on " @entity62 and @entity63			1
' mommy porn ' novel has retro message @entity30 , a tv executive , wife and mother based in @entity69 , took a young adult novel and spiced it up , said @entity71 , a contributing editor at @entity72			2
@entity73 said that since a lot of young adult novels have such broad fan bases now , the success of " @entity5 " will probably be replicated more and more			1
as both a writer and a reader , @entity52 said she appreciates the freedom fan fiction offers			2
" typically i 'm happier to write stories that have sex in them than stories that have violence in them , " she said			0
" i like the custom - madeness of it			1
it 's not just the same story with sex in it			1
but , often , the characters have changed in many ways			1
" " @entity42 " fans familiar with " @entity97 " fan fiction , in which the two male characters engage in a homoerotic relationship , can attest			1
" a lot of erotic ( fan fiction ) is actually queer , " @entity52 said			0
" a lot of people were writing gay and lesbian scenes at a time when there was n't much out there			0
" it made sense to write these scenes around " @entity42 , " she said , which featured a " very consciously diverse group of people			0
... the one conspicuous absence was gays and lesbians			0
fans rewrote those stories to put queer people at the table			0
" @entity52 added , " the wonderful thing about fandom is that you realize you 're not alone			0
" erotic novel ' @entity5 ' goes viral ... for good reason so many mainstream stories now are about women who have children and balance exciting careers			1
but if the buzz surrounding " @entity5 " is any indication , there are women out there who just want to feel like desired , sexual subjects , @entity52 said			1
@entity137 ' novel puts them there , providing an outlet for a sort of creativity that has n't been considered mainstream			0
sexual content is often shunned by the publishing world , said @entity146 staff writer @entity145			0
" people have been really turned on by this book			0
it 's so interesting that something considered dirty and second - rate is being embraced by the industry			1
" however , not all fan fiction is erotic			0
erotic book gains popularity in suburbs " sometimes fan fiction is about seeing more of a character , " @entity52 said			0
" saying , i want to see her in different environments , or see her in a different time			0
... that has a happened a lot with @entity164 , whether he 's in the 1890s or ... contemporary @entity69			2
" but not all authors are on board with fan fiction			0
" @entity170 " author @entity169 wrote about the genre on her website : " i do not allow fan fiction			0
it upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters			2
i advise my readers to write your own original stories with your own characters			2
it is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes			0
" however , other writers have embraced it , allowing such stories to expand the demographic of their original work			0
