-- the @entity2 - made @entity1 turns slowly in the blue autumn sky			1
it appears to be at an altitude of 3,000 - 4,000 feet , circling above the province of @entity7 in northwestern @entity8			1
suddenly , there 's a streak of white and then an explosion -- as its engine bursts into flames			1
off camera , there are yelps of joy			2
it is a rare success for the @entity20 : a precious ground - to - air missile has found its target			1
trailing black smoke , the helicopter makes a hard landing			2
it 's not known what happened to the crew			2
in the last week , the rebels claim to have shot down one plane and two helicopters in @entity7 province			1
@entity0 's @entity33 went to the crash site of the plane wednesday , and saw chunks of metal being carted off by locals			2
@entity39 still weighing whether to arm @entity8 rebels at least one of the pilots appears to have been found unconscious by the rebels after ejecting from the plane			1
videos uploaded to @entity45 appear to show the pilot with a bandaged head wound			1
it 's a sign that the rebels are beginning to use the weapons they 've seized from military bases to good effect , and are gradually beginning to challenge @entity55 government 's dominance of the skies			1
@entity57 reported thursday : " the @entity20 controls vast chunks of territory in @entity7 [ province ]			2
in a span of 24 hours they brought down a fighter jet and helicopter and took over a major base " in the province			2
" what was striking driving through @entity7 , and we were not too far from the city itself , was seeing villages and towns that two months ago one could n't drive through , " @entity57 reported			2
" they now have children playing in the streets and shops opening			2
" " there are some @entity20 checkpoints , " @entity57 reported			2
" this is significant ; you see where @entity55 forces might have been and were but are no longer			2
" rebels who recently seized the base of the @entity87 some 15 miles ( 25 kilometers ) west of @entity7 told @entity57 they had captured as many as 300 @entity88 ( man - portable air - defense systems ) , about half of which were in working condition			1
there is no way of confirming the number			2
videos uploaded after the rebels overran the base showed at least 10 large crates of anti-air missiles , each of which would hold two manpads			1
@entity102 , who tracks the @entity8 conflict through dozens of @entity45 channels on his blog @entity102 , says that when the rebels capture " a couple of dozen [ @entity88 ] it gets exciting ; 100 would be quite amazing " rebels also showed off captured tanks and artillery pieces , as well as @entity113 - made multiple rocket launchers , seized at the @entity87 base			1
as rebels appear to gain ground , @entity115 shuts down in @entity8 free @entity20 brigades are producing " instructional videos " for handling and arming their newly acquired hardware			1
one video shows a rebel on a rocky hillside opening a large packing crate , assembling a @entity125			0
inside , there are two long olive - green tubes with @entity129 lettering			0
over the next three minutes , the rebel assembles the tube and points it skyward			0
it is just one of dozens of anti-air missiles or manpads that the rebels are thought to have seized			1
they are mainly @entity138 - made @entity137 -- some manufactured before the young fighters were born			0
videos uploaded to @entity45 and evidence gathered on the ground suggest most of the manpads in rebel hands are sa - 7s , which the @entity138 call @entity125 2s			1
it is hardly state - of - the - art , having been developed in the 1960s			0
there have also been occasional sightings of more advanced sa - 16s in rebel hands , which @entity102 says has a much better targeting system than the @entity125			0
but he notes that often these missile systems lack the all - important grip - stock or battery cooling unit , making them inoperable			0
despite the rebels ' gradual acquisition of heavy weaponry , much of it is in poor shape and of a certain age			1
there is no sign that rebel units have been using more advanced anti-aircraft missiles such as the @entity166			0
the @entity167 reported this week that rebels had acquired some 40 shoulder - fired missile systems in recent weeks , and some had been supplied by @entity170			1
@entity0 has been unable to confirm that			0
but , in october , a diplomatic source told @entity0 's senior international correspondent @entity173 that some rebel groups had a few @entity176 - made anti-aircraft missiles under " close control			0
" even so , the government retains vast superiority in firepower			0
and opposition sources say it 's using that firepower in ever more indiscriminate ways			0
@entity8 rebels down jet , take video of bloodied pilot @entity102 notes from the hundreds of videos he has analyzed that " rather than deploying all their most powerful weapons at once the air force appears to have escalated the air war			1
" he says " l - 39s [ a @entity197 - made jet trainer that can also fly combat missions ] and @entity199 100 - 120 bombs [ @entity138 - made fragmentation munitions ] appeared after the battle for @entity7 began , and cluster munitions appeared after the @entity204 highway was closed			0
" on thursday , videos emerged from the city of @entity7 of an airstrike against a neighborhood in rebel hands			1
they showed the bodies of men , women and children , caked in white dust and blood , being pulled from piles of rubble by frantic rescuers			0
above , the top floors of an apartment block have been sheared off , raining lumps of concrete on the street below			0
opposition activists estimated at least 15 people were killed			0
other videos uploaded by opposition activists this week show the town of @entity230 , captured by rebels in october , enduring a fourth week of air - raids			1
the town sits on the main highway linking @entity235 with the north , an important artery that is no longer under government control			0
@entity239 , professor of @entity241 politics and international relations at the @entity243 , tells @entity0 : " i think the opposition is chipping away at the government 's position			0
i think the opposition strategy is a war of attrition to exhaust the government 's forces			0
" after spending several days among rebel fighters , @entity57 says that " on the one hand there 's a certain sense of anger and frustration with the international community because they feel they have been abandoned			0
at the same time they have n't lost			0
they are making major progress and there is a sense of determination and belief that they can do this on their own			1
" @entity272 , @entity271 scout locations for missile protection from @entity8 @entity33 reported from @entity8 and @entity274 from @entity275			1
@entity0 's @entity173 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			0

rebels make progress against @entity8 air might
still , much of their weaponry is *outdated*
they are producing instructional videos for use of military hardware
