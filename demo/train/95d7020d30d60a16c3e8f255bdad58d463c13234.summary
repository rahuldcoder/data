@entity4 a @entity3 journalist 's @entity1 captors cared little about religion , @entity7 -- who spent over 10 months as the group 's prisoner in @entity11 -- told @entity5 's @entity12 in an exclusive interview on tuesday			1
" there was never really discussion about texts or -- it was not a religious discussion			2
it was a political discussion			2
" " it was more hammering what they were believing than teaching us about the @entity23			2
because it has nothing to do with the @entity23			2
" " we did n't even have the @entity23 ; they did n't want even to give us a @entity23			1
" @entity7 was released in april last year , but has only rarely spoken about his ordeal			1
he is one of the rare @entity1 hostages who was freed			1
among those still held by @entity1 is an @entity31 woman , @entity31 president @entity32 acknowledged this weekend in an interview with @entity34			1
@entity7 told @entity12 that he had met her twice			1
he was reluctant to get into details , lest anything jeopardize her safety			0
in general , he said , women " had a bit more freedom of movement , " but being an @entity1 hostage is " frightening enough , " and " being a woman does n't make it easier			1
" @entity7 saw unimaginable horrors while detained			1
when @entity1 held him in an @entity47 hospital , he routinely heard and saw the aftermath of his captors ' torture of local @entity11 and @entity51 who fell afoul of their hardline rules			1
" we could see some of them in the corridors when we were taken to the toilets , " he said , " and we could see some people lying in their blood			0
" " you could see the chains hanging , or the ropes hanging , or the iron bars			0
" @entity7 is matter of fact when describing his own treatment			1
" of course we were beaten up			0
but it was not every day			0
i mean , it 's hard enough -- you do n't have to overplay it			2
" " it 's hard enough to lose your freedom			0
it 's hard enough to be in the hands of people who you know are killing hundreds and thousands of local @entity11 , @entity51 , @entity76 , @entity77 , can put bombs in our countries			1
" " it 's terrifying enough			0
the beating is strong , but it 's not every day			0
" " if they wanted to wreck you , they could			0
none of us would have been able to go through if it was beating every day , and torture every day			0
" through @entity1 's brutal executions of @entity95 journalists , one anonymous fighter has seared himself into the world 's consciousness -- nicknamed " @entity100 " for his distinctly @entity99 accent			1
@entity7 knew @entity100 while in captivity ; he was one of the guards			1
" you can see on the video -- he 's not somebody you 'd like to have to deal with			0
" the @entity99 jihadis , nicknamed " @entity108 " by the hostages , were " harsher in their violence , " he said			1
they were , he told @entity12 , more extreme -- the food the @entity113 gave them was better , " but the beating was harsher			1
" jihadists from the former @entity3 colonies in @entity118 , or the @entity119 , were also comparatively harsh in their treatment of @entity3 captives , @entity7 said			1
they " were much more keen to [ put ] the @entity3 hostages in the same groups as the @entity31 and the @entity99 , and not negotiate for us , " @entity7 said			1
@entity7 was released just before @entity1 made its shocking sweep through @entity51 , capturing vast amounts of territory			1
indeed , he now says , he does not believe he and his three colleagues would be released were they still in @entity1 hands , " especially with @entity3 involved in the coalition and bombing in @entity51			1
" " we were lucky			0
" when he went to @entity11 , he told @entity12 , a journalist or @entity137 worker 's capture was not reported , so it was hard to know just how dangerous it was			2
" so we did n't know the level of the risk , or we did n't realize the level of the risk at the time			2
plus it was the time when the people from @entity1 were still hiding within @entity146 and did n't organize their kind of coup within @entity149			1
" unlike the @entity31 and the @entity99 , many @entity151 countries are believed to pay ransom for hostages held by terrorist groups , including @entity1			1
@entity3 has publicly denied paying a ransom for the journalists ' release			0
" it 's never only a question of money , " @entity7 said , calling speculation in the media about amounts of money that may have been paid " utterly ridiculous			2
" @entity7 was held captive with @entity165 , the journalist whose brutal execution fby @entity1 -- and the video that followed -- was the first in a sickening line			1
" @entity165 was an amazing friend , " @entity7 said			1
" he never gave up			2
he had a fantastic heart			1
" " he was always trying to get things for the others			0
" when guards asked the hostages if they needed anything , they would all reflexively reply no , not wanting to rock the boat			0
@entity165 , by contrast , would suggest perhaps they could have some vegetables to vary their diet			2
" they did n't like the fact that he was not broken			2
and that 's the reason why he was getting more beaten			0
because he was not broken			0
he was still fighting , in his way			0
" when @entity165 was so gruesomely murdered , @entity100 was seen in an @entity1 propaganda video putting a knife to the journalist 's neck			1
the actual beheading was not shown on camera , leading to speculation about whether @entity100 was actually behind the killing			0
@entity7 told @entity12 he believes it was @entity100 who committed the murder			2
as a former captive , @entity7 has incredible perspective on the inner workings of an opaque and new organization			1
" the @entity51 and the @entity11 people who join @entity1 are much more traditional conservative kind of guys from the tribes			1
" " and sometimes it 's not easy for them to fit with the jihadis coming from other countries , because they do n't share the same ideas , they do n't share the same behaviors , they do n't have the same codes			2
and sometimes it 's really tense between them			0
" unlike @entity149 , from which @entity1 was cleft , @entity219 " is always trying to root his organization in the local conflict			2
" " he always tries to push the @entity221 tribes , the @entity222 , to fight against the @entity223 , or the @entity224 , or the @entity225			0
and they trying to play communities one against the others			0
that 's how he survives			0
that 's how he recruits			0
" " he is using , of course , those young guys coming from @entity151 or coming from all over the place			0
but it 's only one part of his organization			0
the strongest parts of his organization are the tribes , the local @entity221 tribes			0
" survival , he said , was a matter of trying to exist " in between those			0

@entity7 says his @entity1 captors " did n't want even to give us a quran "
he was held captive by @entity1 for 10 months in @entity11
the @entity99 jihadis were " harsher in their violence "
@entity165 " never gave up ; he had a fantastic heart "
