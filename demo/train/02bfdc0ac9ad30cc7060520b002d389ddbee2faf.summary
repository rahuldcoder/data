@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 are battle buddies			1
they both joined the @entity7 at 18			2
they 've served together on missions at home and abroad			1
but both also bear mental and physical scars from their military service in @entity14 : @entity3 lost his legs to an anti-tank land mine , and @entity4 suffered a traumatic brain injury			1
while @entity3 was recovering at @entity20 in @entity21 , members of his community offered to help him build a home for his family			1
the gesture deeply affected him , inspiring a new mission			2
in 2008 , @entity3 and @entity4 founded @entity26 , a nonprofit that has modified or helped provide homes to 23 disabled @entity29 veterans			1
@entity3 was honored as a @entity30 this year for his work helping veterans			1
he recently sat down to talk about his work , his friendship with @entity4 and the unexpected roads they 've traveled together			1
@entity2 : how did you and @entity4 meet ? @entity3 : @entity4 and i met probably in 1996 , in the @entity7			1
we were just two young , 18 - year - old kids			2
... once you 're in the military and you have a battle buddy , they 're your battle buddy for life			1
he 's been there every step of the way			2
we 've done everything together			2
... we grew up together in the service			0
and i do n't think that 's a new thing for anybody			0
my grandfather did it with his buddies in @entity59 i think of us then , skinny little kids in green uniforms ... they do n't even wear those uniforms anymore , so you know that 's a long time ago			0
but it 's cool to see where we 've come			0
@entity2 : @entity4 had actually left the @entity7 when you got orders to deploy to @entity14			1
how did he end up going with you ? @entity3 : i called and i said , " do you want a vacation ? " he 's like , " what are you talking about ? " and i said : " we 're going to @entity14			1
do you want to go ? " he showed up a couple hours later ( and ) re-enlisted			0
that bond -- you ca n't let your friends go without you , if you can help it			0
we deployed in early 2004 , and we were attached to the @entity78			0
... we did a lot of missions right alongside the @entity81 : escorting convoys , searching houses , you name it			0
@entity2 : you were also injured together in november 2004			1
what happened exactly , and how did that impact your friendship ? @entity3 : we were on a patrol , part of combat operations on a supply route			0
this highway had been heavily mined in the past month with insurgent activity			0
there was always something going on , so we went out to kind of recon the area			0
the vehicle we were in -- @entity4 was driving -- we just went off the side of the road a little bit to avoid something			1
... i remember seeing all the sand across the dash of the @entity108 -- just like poof , pop -- go up in the air , and that was pretty much the last thing i remember			0
... there were anti-tank mines in the gravel , so that 's eventually how i lost both legs			0
... i know he felt really bad about it for a long time , something that was not even his fault			0
he blamed himself a lot for my injury			0
... @entity4 had those hidden wounds with traumatic brain injury and ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) , and i saw him struggle			1
@entity2 : your community helped you build your home			1
how was @entity4 involved in that , and how did that process inspire you to start @entity26 ? @entity3 : during the construction of my house , i was the contractor , my dad was my superintendent and @entity4 was kind of my confidant			1
... he 's been a custom builder since he was fairly young , so if i wanted to know about , " what 's the code issue on this specific thing ? what 's most cost effective solution ? " i would call , pick his brain and he always gave me good advice			0
closer to the end , he moved back to @entity0 and was able to help during the final build of the house			1
... when my community was helping me , it really showed me the potential power and the effectiveness of groups within communities , especially when we 're talking about veterans			2
... my family really had the best - case scenario for a family that had been hurt that bad , and i knew , after meeting other veterans , that that was n't the case for all of us			2
... there 's not as much help for ( veterans ) who were n't injured in @entity14 and @entity167			1
... @entity4 and i sat down and we started thinking about a nonprofit			1
... i really wanted to create a group that could show people that there 's thousands of veterans right here in our midst that could use help			2
that 's really what led us to form our organization with the values and the mission that we have			0
... regardless of when you served , we 're all the same			2
being able to empower communities to take care of even those gray - haired , distinguished veterans -- that 's really what we 're after			2
@entity2 : how does your experience serving in the military with @entity4 impact your working relationship ? @entity3 : the bond that you form doing the jobs and the dangerous missions we ( did ) is unbreakable			1
i might get mad at him , but i know we 'll be able to talk in 15 minutes after that			0
we really make a good team			0
... he 's really the hard - driving pusher that tries to make stuff happen , and i 'm the one who says , " hey , wait , let 's think about that again before it happens			0
" ... we 're an odd couple , but it works			0
... @entity4 and i have really grasped this , and we 're running with it as fast and as hard as we can			1
... i 'm glad he 's still my battle buddy , and i 'm glad we 've been able to have this next chapter of our lives , doing good things and helping people out .			0
