-- in a world where people power appears to be gaining momentum , you could be forgiven for thinking this month 's meeting of the rich and powerful in the @entity7 ski resort of @entity8 is an anachronism			1
the @entity10 -- an informal meeting of executives , presidents , thinkers and stars -- once brokered history - changing encounters			1
now critics say it is struggling for relevance at a time when the future is being shaped in the streets of @entity23 or protest camps of @entity25			1
this appears to be borne out by events of the past 12 months			0
despite hosting intense meetings about @entity31 's debt crisis and hastily - convened talks about the evolving political situation in @entity34 , the @entity10 's 2011 enclave seems to have little to show for itself			2
@entity37 's image problem is easy to quantify : it offers a haven for the capitalist world 's elite at a time when social media has galvanized popular movements calling for greater democracy and a major rethink of the financial systems behind the global financial crisis			0
" it is a very undemocratic meeting , " said @entity49 , president of @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , who is helping to organize an " @entity8 " igloo camp in the icy streets beyond the @entity10 's heavily - guarded perimeter			1
" it is a meeting for those who have created the crisis and they always have the same claims that , after being one of the reasons for the crisis , they think they are the solution to the crisis			0
we never get out of this because the same non-democratic people are making the decisions			0
" those involved in the @entity10 are clearly not unaware of such viewpoints			2
this year 's event is titled : " the great transformation : shaping new models , " and features debates on the future of capitalism , democracy , the eurozone and the @entity78 world			0
" this is not one of the easiest environments for @entity8 , there is so much economic uncertainty , so much resentment towards bankers and business leaders generally , " said @entity81 , a former @entity82 deputy secretary general and adviser to @entity10 financial talks			1
but he and others insist that the five - day meeting can still play an important role in a turbulent world by offering lines of communication that bypass formal diplomacy to unite radically different perspectives			0
" it is exactly these kinds of moments , where the official channels have clogged up in terms of finding solutions to the crisis both within @entity108 but more broadly at the global level , where @entity8 comes into its own , " he added			2
nevertheless , he warns , the chances of this year 's @entity8 delegates mapping a route out of the problems such as the debt crisis threatening to tear apart the eurozone , are as slim as in 2011 when , he says , little in the way of concrete economic policy was formulated			2
" to be honest this year i do n't see any great international initiatives , " he said			0
" this is a very frightened , nervous and reactive global environment , so this is one of those years where @entity8 is much more about mood - taking ; trying to find how intense or not the level of anxiety is in this strange environment , where so many of the formal business signals are going the wrong way			1
" @entity128 , a researcher in political economics at @entity130 appointed as a @entity10 young global leader , argues that in spite of its elitist nature , @entity8 offers diverse face - to - face encounters in an age when people are often sequestered behind computer screens			1
" i do n't think in those five days the world 's problems get solved , but if people have good use of that time and opportunity they can prepare the ground to then have better communication with other folks and open communication channels , " he said			0
" to have a place where you can pretty much meet everyone in person and have a conversation -- that 's very meaningful			0
" @entity154 , ceo of @entity156 telecoms giant @entity155 and a @entity10 board member , also argues that although @entity8 " is not a negotiation , " it represents a fruitful cross-cultural trade of ideas rarely seen in the closeted worlds of politics , business or academia			1
says @entity154 , the failure of numerous crisis meetings held over the past 24 months by economists and @entity108 leaders to create a solution to the eurozone problem underscores the need for the alternative dialogues hosted by @entity8			1
" i would say it 's more relevant than ever , " he said .			0

critics say the @entity10 meeting in @entity8 is struggling for relevance in the era of people power
forum regular @entity81 says many now resent business leaders who attend
but board member @entity154 says @entity8 dialogue is relevant part of effort to solve global problems
