-- if anyone deserved the death penalty , it was @entity4			1
he committed a series of vile acts that we as a civilization would condemn under any circumstances			0
in august 2000 , a jury in @entity11 found @entity4 guilty of first - degree murder , rape , forcible oral sodomy , kidnapping and a bevy of other charges -- 19 in all			1
they stemmed from a robbery - gone - wrong in which victims were tied up at gunpoint ; one young woman was raped multiple times , and another , who had just graduated from high school , was shot and buried alive in a ditch			2
on tuesday night , @entity4 was scheduled to die by lethal injection -- the preferred means for executing criminals in states that allow for the death penalty			1
during lethal injections , subjects are given a chemical cocktail designed to put them to sleep , render paralysis and then stop the heart			0
one problem for death - penalty states , such as my state of @entity42 , is the chemicals used for lethal injection are hard to come by , partly because some companies who produce the chemicals refuse to sell them for the purposes of executions			1
so in the case of @entity4 , the state of @entity11 tested a new combination of chemicals			2
instead of putting @entity4 to sleep and stopping his heart , the administration of the lethal injection caused his vein to burst , and about 45 minutes later , he died of a heart attack			2
it 's been dubbed a " botched execution , " and @entity11 gov. @entity60 stayed another execution scheduled for tuesday evening pending an investigation			2
this is an absurd problem for states to wrestle with -- this notion of how to kill someone properly			2
like i said , if anyone deserved the death penalty , it was @entity4 , but the real debate is whether we need to be in the business of trying to find the least cruel and least unusual way to kill anyone voluntarily			1
it seems clear that the death penalty is a 19th - century relic , and our ridiculous struggle to figure out how to do it properly in the 21st century is a signal that perhaps we should join the rest of the civilized western world in abolishing executions			1
even @entity86 has n't had an execution since 1999 , and i would n't exactly call @entity88 soft on crime			1
but please understand that i am not some left - wing , dyed - in - the - wool liberal who simply believes all criminal behavior is the fault of a system that fosters deviance			2
i believe that if you take somebody 's life with premeditation , and if a jury , after hearing all of the evidence properly presented by competent counsel , finds you guilty , then you should die -- but in prison , at the end of a life sentence			2
my objection to the death penalty is pragmatic			1
it 's ineffective as a deterrent , and it is an extraordinary burden on our justice system			0
for a punishment to offer an effective deterrence , it has to be applied swiftly to maintain the logical cause and effect relationship with the crime , that this is a consequence			0
but we simply can not , and should not , act quickly			0
the extended period required to ensure that the death penalty is appropriate -- that all options and appeals have been exhausted before resorting to the ultimate punishment -- is an essential safeguard in a civilized society			1
in @entity4 's case , this process took nearly 14 years			2
even with this long process of appeals , our system is far from perfect			0
innocence projects around the country have saved 144 death - row inmates since 1973 by presenting new evidence that has proven them not guilty			2
think of how many innocent people we have executed , when the number should be zero			0
we should all be shocked and appalled			0
since we know innocent people sometimes get convicted based upon bad identification , faulty witnesses , improper police activities and incompetent counsel , ca n't we at least agree to avoid killing somebody when we know we have an imperfect system ? and the burden of the appeals process on the criminal justice system is huge			1
a recent report from @entity150 shows the average cost to carry a death penalty case from prosecution to execution is three to 10 times more than a case with a life sentence			1
very often , a life sentence costs the state less than $ 1 million			0
some death penalty cases have cost more than $ 10 million			1
the excruciatingly long , and necessary , appeals process in death penalty cases cost taxpayers millions for each case , and it draws resources away from other important prosecutions			1
is it worth the price ? it would be worth the price , if that was what it took to get justice			0
but is the death penalty justice ? or is it retribution ? often in a death penalty case , members of the victim 's family are the strongest advocates for a death sentence			1
they say they want justice for their slain loved one , but what they often truly want is retribution			0
this is both understandable and acceptable			0
@entity189 , a tooth for a tooth			0
but it 's never that simple			0
i 've tried death penalty cases , and i 've been lucky : none of my clients has ever been sent to death row			1
but i know many good lawyers who have n't been so lucky			0
you may be surprised to know that in many death penalty cases , which last for years , defense lawyers get to know victims ' families			1
the families of homicide victims , after an execution , often do n't feel the long sought - after sense of relief they expected			1
often , they are left , instead , with unresolved emptiness			0
two lives are lost when a murder is committed , and two families are irrevocably altered			0
we should feel the pain as well , and spend more time , effort and money on those who are affected			0
we should not spend ever - dwindling resources figuring out ways to kill			0
the death penalty is flawed in every conceivable way , and it should be abolished .			1

@entity224 acknowledges if anyone deserved death penalty , @entity4 did
@entity224 : but execution is a 19th - century relic , and we still ca n't do it properly
he asks how many innocent inmates have been killed ?
@entity224 : it does n't deter crime , and victims ' families often left feeling no relief
