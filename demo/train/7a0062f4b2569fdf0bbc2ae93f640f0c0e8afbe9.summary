-- most of us have done it			0
at @entity8 's @entity7 work area , employees ' e-mail ideas are made into reality			1
instead of hitting " reply " to an e-mail , we accidentally push " reply all , " sending a potentially embarrassing or insulting message to those we did n't intend to see it			2
to address this problem , @entity8 's @entity7 has launched an experimental feature called " @entity18 " that gives users a chance to rewrite their message , correct settings or simply fix typos			1
when a @entity7 user who enables this feature sends an e-mail , a button that says " @entity18 " will pop up on their screen for five seconds			1
if the user hits the button within that time , the service will retrieve the e-mail in draft form -- allowing the user to make changes or cancel the message altogether			2
" sometimes ... i send a message and then immediately notice a mistake , " said @entity36 , a @entity7 designer and the creator of the " @entity18 " feature , in the @entity7 blog			1
" i forget to attach a file , or e-mail the birthday girl that i ca n't make her surprise party			0
i can rush to close my browser or unplug the @entity46 -- but @entity7 almost always wins that race			2
" @entity36 added that he 's had " @entity48 " turned on for a while " and it 's saved me several times			0
" this may be good news to @entity7 's tens of millions of users as people in the digital era look to connect with others over the web in a more efficient manner			1
" @entity18 " is also just the latest example of the dozens of creative -- and sometimes downright wacky -- online features developed at @entity7 to address common e-mail problems			1
launched in june , @entity7 is an optional program			2
it offers an assortment of tools , ranging from a service that stores e-mails onto a user 's desktop so the user can access mail offline to a feature that prevents users from firing away drunken e-mails during late - night hours			1
@entity7 users can enable the @entity7 settings by going to their settings tab			2
then they can customize their account by turning on features of their choosing			0
since the @entity7 program began , the features have grown in popularity among users , @entity8 officials said			1
the number of lab features has more than tripled , to more than 36 , as @entity7 celebrates its fifth birthday next week			2
@entity8 's @entity7 also typifies the @entity90 , @entity91 - based company 's reputation for innovation and brainstorming			1
at @entity8 , @entity7 engineers can allocate 20 percent of their workweek to their own projects , which can include creating @entity7 features			1
@entity8 hopes the labs create an environment that will find out what @entity7 users like and dislike			1
" there is no screening process , " said @entity103 , a @entity8 product manager			2
" it 's up to whatever people want to build internally			0
" @entity108 , a @entity7 engineer , introduced the practical idea of " @entity110 " to help users , including himself , stop sending " mail you later regret			1
" @entity108 created the function last fall when he found himself sending messages to an ex-girlfriend -- late at night -- asking to get back together			0
with @entity108 's @entity110 , users can specify which hours they would like to enable the feature			1
if a user tries to send an e-mail during the self - selected time -- say , midnight to 3 a.m. -- a screen pops up forcing the user to solve a series of simple math problems before the message can be sent			0
theoretically , this gives time for the intoxicated or emotional e-mailer to reconsider			0
@entity7 also recently developed a feature that helps users who forget to add photo or document attachments to their e-mails			1
users can turn on a " forgotten attachment detector " ; if the program finds the word " attachment " in the e-mail text , a box pops up reminding the user to add an attachment			0
@entity7 engineer @entity142 was celebrating @entity143 last year at a bar when he came up with a feature to help e-mail addicts			1
@entity142 realized he was wasting valuable work time checking e-mails			0
" someone joked that it would be a great feature of @entity7 to keep you from checking e-mail , " @entity142 said			1
so he created a program that locks people out of their @entity7 accounts for a set period of time			0
after spending two afternoons coding it , @entity157 launched the " @entity163 " feature , which forces users to take a break from e-mailing by blocking @entity7 for 15 minutes			1
@entity165 officials say the best lab ideas will eventually become standard features in @entity7			2
for example , the idea of @entity169 started as a lab concept			0
" the best thing you can do is to put your product and team in a position where you can move fast and get feedback from users to find out what sticks in the marketplace , " @entity103 said			0
@entity7 is the third most popular e-mail site , following @entity182 and @entity183 , according to @entity185 's @entity184 , a site that tracks web traffic			1
@entity8 declined to comment on @entity7 user growth			1
other e-mail services also are trying to enhance the electronic messaging experience			0
@entity183 added a " what 's new " feed in february that allows users to see what their friends and family are up to as well as pictures or posts they may have added			0
in 2006 , @entity8 added a chat feature			2
last fall the company added a video function allowing users to see each other when they e-mail			0
@entity8 officials hope to continue adding features regularly			2
that 'll be good news to @entity209 of @entity210 , @entity211 , who uses @entity7 at least 16 hours a day between work and personal communication to family and friends			0
@entity209 runs the @entity218 company @entity216 , a professional development portal for colleges and universities , where his 15 employees are required to use @entity7			0
the video and chat functions also help workers stay connected when they are traveling , he said			0
@entity209 especially likes " superstars , " a @entity7 tool that lets him prioritize e-mails with star icons and colored labels			1
because his company receives thousands of e-mails a day , he said he and his coworkers would not be able to effectively manage their company without @entity7			2
" with the way the economy is going , our company is growing very quickly , " @entity209 said			0
" so the more organization we have , the better it is for us			0

@entity8 's new @entity7 feature , " @entity18 , " lets users *rescind* messages
" @entity110 " can prevent users from sending drunk e-mails they may later regret
the best @entity7 features become *permanent* if enough users like them
@entity7 is the third most popular e-mail service , with tens of millions of users
