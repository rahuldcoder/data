@entity0 thumped @entity2 6 - 2 6 - 2 wednesday to make it past the quarterfinals at the @entity5 -- and that spells trouble for her rivals who are still in contention at the season 's first major			1
the world no. 1 has never lost in @entity13 when she 's played a semifinal or final -- going 10 - 0 -- with her record overall in grand slam semifinals and finals an impressive 40 - 7			1
further not since the @entity18 has the 33 - year - old fallen in a grand slam semifinal or final			2
those are indeed ominous numbers for her semifinal opponent and fellow @entity25 @entity24 , who prevented an all - @entity0 encounter in the last four when she edged @entity27 6 - 3 4 - 6 6 - 4			1
keys became the third young , surprise semifinalist at the @entity5 in three seasons , joining @entity31 and @entity32			1
but @entity0 was n't looking too far ahead just yet			1
the 18 - time grand slam winner was simply happy to advance to the semifinals , having not done so in @entity13 since capturing the title in 2010			1
" it 's finally good to get past the quarterfinals or the fourth round , " she said			2
" i forgot what it 's like for this place , for @entity13 , to look a little empty			2
gosh , it 's been so long			2
" she progressed over 2014 finalist @entity2 despite continuing to struggle with a sore throat			1
" i 've been sick the past few days , " she said			0
" it 's just getting worse and worse			2
but hopefully it will start getting better			0
" i heard it 's a virus going around with a lot of the players			2
i think i caught it			0
" the 19 - year - old keys will attempt to go one better than @entity31 and @entity32 when she takes on @entity0 in a maiden semifinal at a major			1
against @entity27 , the powerful keys was n't without her own health issues , calling the trainer for a thigh injury in the second set			1
she 'll hope the injury gets better -- and fast -- since keys wo n't have a day off prior to the semis			0
" it still hurts , " said @entity24			1
" definitely going to be getting some treatment on that			0
" keys rallied from a break down in the final set against the seven - time grand slam champion , who was competing in her first major quarterfinal in five years			0
she was helped by her opponent , who committed 38 unforced errors to go along with only 10 winners			0
in the third set alone , @entity27 hit three winners and 13 unforced errors			1
" this is her moment today , " said @entity27			1
" i think it was pretty rare that i was able to string together three or four points without an error			0
that was unfortunate for me today			0
but next time i 'll be able to play more solid			0
" it 's definitely been a great last like four weeks , i think , " added @entity0 , who won a warmup event in @entity85			1
" a lot of match wins , a lot of momentum , just a lot of great things happening that everybody wants to happen in their career			0
" i think a lot of players would have been happy with this tournament			0
i 'm happy with progress			0
i 'm not happy with a loss , i 'll tell you that			0
" the other semifinal is an all - @entity103 affair -- @entity104 challenges @entity105			0
@entity106 betters @entity107 defending men 's champion @entity106 continued his fine form , brushing aside @entity107			1
when they met at the @entity111 in the quarterfinals , @entity107 upset @entity106 in five sets before later making his first grand slam final			2
but wednesday 's quarterfinal contest was n't close , with @entity106 prevailing 6 - 3 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 6 )			1
@entity106 rallied from a 5 - 1 deficit in a fourth - set tiebreak in his previous match against @entity118 -- but almost blew a 6 - 1 lead in the fourth - set tiebreak versus @entity120			1
the @entity122 baseliner drew level at 6 - 6 , only to then miss a drop shot into the net when he was controlling the rally			0
" that one i was really happy because i was not going to get to that ball , " @entity106 told reporters			2
@entity106 closed out the match with a big serve			2
@entity106 improved to 16 - 4 in tiebreaks in @entity13 , including 5 - 0 this year			1
he 'll next battle world no. 1 @entity133 in the pair 's third meeting in @entity13 in three seasons			1
the previous two went to five sets			0
they went five sets at the @entity111 in 2013 , too			0
" we had some crazy matches in the grand slams in the past , " @entity106 said			2
@entity133 , in the last match on @entity144 , had little trouble defeating big - serving @entity147 @entity146 7 - 6 ( 5 ) 6 - 4 6 - 2			1
he did n't face a break point			0
two - time grand slam winner @entity149 plays 2010 @entity152 finalist @entity151 in the first men 's semifinal thursday			1
@entity151 upset @entity155 on wednesday and has yet to drop a set this fortnight .			0

@entity0 crushes @entity2 at the @entity5
@entity0 moves into the semifinals against @entity24
@entity24 prevents an all - @entity0 clash by downing @entity27
@entity133 , @entity106 to face off in men 's semifinals
