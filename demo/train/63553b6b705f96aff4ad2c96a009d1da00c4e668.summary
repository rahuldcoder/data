@entity0 -- the @entity2 was identified wednesday as the world 's no. 1 user of targeted killings -- largely as a result of its dependence on unmanned drone attacks in @entity10 and @entity11			1
a report released by the @entity13 called the drone attacks part of a " strongly asserted but ill - defined license to kill without accountability " and warned that they are contributing to an erosion of longstanding international rules governing warfare			1
it urged states to identify publicly the rules of international law believed to provide a basis for any attempted targeted killings as well as the rationale for deciding to kill instead of capture individuals			1
" the rules being set today are going to govern the conduct of many states tomorrow , " said @entity30 law professor @entity29 , the report 's author			2
" the international community needs to be more forceful in demanding accountability			0
" @entity29 , who also works for the @entity37 , said roughly 40 countries possess drone technology , and many of them either already have or attempting to acquire the capability to launch missiles from drones			0
" i 'm particularly concerned that the @entity2 seems oblivious to this fact when it asserts an ever - expanding entitlement for itself to target individuals around the globe , " he said			0
this " ill - defined license to kill without accountability is not an entitlement which the @entity2 or other states can have without doing grave damage to the rules designed to protect the right to life and prevent extrajudicial executions			2
" in the eight years of @entity59 's presidency , unmanned aircraft -- or drones -- attacked militant targets 45 times			0
since president @entity65 took office , the numbers have risen sharply : 53 last year and 39 so far this year in @entity10 alone , according to the @entity68 , a @entity0 foreign policy think tank			1
while the @entity2 is the only country in the region of @entity10 and @entity11 known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- @entity2 officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes			1
the report distinguishes between drone attacks conducted by the @entity77 and those launched by the @entity79			1
the @entity2 military has a " relatively public accountability process , " @entity29 said			2
but @entity79 attacks reponsible for the deaths of " many hundreds of people ... remain shrouded in official secrecy			1
" " the international community does not know when or where the @entity79 is authorized to kill , the criteria for individuals who may be killed , how it ensures killings are legal , and what follow - up there is when civilians are illegally killed , " he said			1
@entity29 , who backs an end to @entity79 drone attacks , argued that " intelligence agencies , which by definition are determined to remain unaccountable except to their own paymasters , have no place in running programs that kill people in other countries			1
" he also blasted @entity2 officials for embracing what he characterized as an " expansive and open - ended interpretation of the right of self - defence			0
" the current @entity2 stance " goes a long way towards destroying the prohibition on the use of armed force contained in the @entity110 , " he asserted			0
the report cited two key issues : " excessively broad circumstances " under which targeted killings are deemed to be legal , and the lack of accountability when they are used			1
@entity29 conceded the conflict with @entity120 and other extremist organizations pose a unique challenge and noted that @entity120 routinely kills innocent civilians			0
" but the fact that such enemies do not play by the rules does not mean that a government can cast those rules aside or unilaterally re-interpret them , " he said			0
" the credibility of any government 's claim that it is fighting to uphold the rule of law depends of its willingness to disclose how it interprets and applies the law -- and the actions it takes when the law is broken			2
" @entity79 spokesman @entity138 took issue with @entity29 's claim of a lack of accountability			1
" without discussing or confirming any specific action or program , this agency 's operations unfold within a framework of law and close government oversight , " he said			0
" the accountability 's real , and it would be wrong for anyone to suggest otherwise			0
" one @entity2 official , who spoke to @entity1 on the condition of anonymity because @entity2 operations are classified , insisted that the @entity2 is not violating international law			1
" the @entity110 clearly states that nothing ... shall impair the inherent right of individual or self - defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the @entity13 , " the official said			2
" militants based in @entity10 regularly attack @entity2 and coalition forces in @entity11			1
the @entity2 and its allies have a right and responsibility to protect themselves against dangerous enemies			0
the @entity2 has an ' inherent right ' to protect itself , and we will not refrain from doing so based on an exceptionally narrow -- and faulty -- definition of self - defense			2
" the official said the @entity2 has @entity10 cooperation in " conducting precise actions to take dangerous figures off the battlefield			1
and we do so with an absolute commitment to minimize non-combatant casualties and property damage			0
" " the precision is unsurpassed in the history of human conflict , " the official said			0
" no one 's come up with a better alternative , assuming they see value in trying to stop killers like @entity120 and the @entity10 @entity189			2
this is a policy of legitimate and lawful self - defense , driven by absolute necessity			0
" @entity1 's @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
