-- rain has played havoc with the @entity3 in @entity4 in recent years but two new retractable roofs mean the weather - related woes will soon be a thing of the past			1
the @entity10 said thursday at a news conference in @entity4 that tennis ' largest stadium would benefit from a retractable roof as early as 2016 , bringing the event in line with two other majors that already have cover -- the @entity19 and @entity17			1
a more realistic forecast for that roof is 2017 , though , the @entity10 said			2
the @entity10 added that the tournament 's secondary show court , @entity24 , would have its own retractable roof by 2018 and has n't ruled out the possibility of covering a third arena at a later stage			1
the overall cost of the wide ranging project -- which will also include building a new and bigger @entity24 and @entity31 -- is expected to hit $ 550 million , the @entity10 said			2
both of those stadiums are roughly 50 years old			0
the retractable roof over @entity35 alone is expected to cost in excess of $ 100 million			1
the men 's governing body in the @entity40 will " self - finance " the project through a combination of bonds and " @entity10 revenue generation , " it said in a statement			2
" we have been working toward a viable design for a roof on @entity53 for more than a decade , " @entity10 chairman and president @entity47 said in the statement			1
" through a long and arduous process , we feel that we now have a design that meets the criteria of being architecturally sound , aesthetically pleasing , reasonably affordable and buildable			0
" players including women 's no. 1 @entity58 welcomed the news , which likely will mean the tournament wo n't enter a 15th day			1
the previous five editions have seen monday men 's finals because of rain , in some cases leading to an unfair advantage for one of the participants in the finale			1
in 2008 , while @entity72 was already through to the final after completing his semifinal on a saturday , @entity71 had to finish his semifinal a day later due to bad weather before contesting the final on the monday			1
" obviously it 's going to be great , " @entity58 told reporters in @entity79 , where she is competing at the @entity80			2
" it 's good to know they 're going for it			2
" when i first started playing the @entity19 back in the ' 90s , it did n't rain and now it rains only on the final weekend			2
last four @entity40 opens i 've played , they 've had to change completely the schedule			0
" you just got to keep moving with the times , " said @entity58 , who missed the @entity91 due to a foot injury			0
@entity71 , however , said having a roof was n't without its negatives			0
" i do n't necessarily miss being rained off , but rain delays used to be part of ( grand slams ) , " @entity71 told reporters in @entity79			0
" that 's kind of going away gradually			0
" i do n't particularly like going from indoors to outdoors			0
it 's also so tough			0
but it 's good for tv			0
" the @entity10 has indeed for years looked into having a retractable roof at @entity53 -- which seats 22,500 fans -- but it was thought the extra weight could n't be supported			1
@entity110 and engineering advances have now made the work possible			0
by the time all the enhancements are completed , it 's anticipated that an extra 10,000 fans per day will be able watch the tennis on site			1
@entity119 ' other major , the @entity118 , is hoping to have a roof in place for 2018 although that is not guaranteed			0
tsonga pulls out of @entity4 @entity123 , meanwhile , is skipping this year 's @entity3 because of the knee injury that forced him to retire at @entity17 , he told his website			1
the entertaining @entity126 was forced to stop against @entity127 in the second round at the @entity129 in june and has n't played since			0
" it would be stupid to go there knowing full well that i have no chance because i 'm not prepared enough , " the world no. 8 said			0
although he has yet to win a grand slam -- the @entity126 men 's drought in singles extends to 30 years -- @entity123 had reached the quarterfinals or better in four of his five majors prior to @entity17			1
he 's optimistic of returning in time for an indoor tournament in @entity126 in mid-september			2
this season 's @entity3 begins august 26th .			1

the @entity3 will have a retractable roof over @entity53 as early as 2016
the tournament has been *affected* by rain since 2008 , leading to monday finals
@entity151 and bigger second and third show courts will also be constructed on site
this year 's tournament will be without @entity123 , who pulled out injured
