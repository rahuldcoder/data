@entity0 -- jurors in the trial of @entity5 's doctor worked for more than seven hours friday before telling the judge that they had not reached a verdict and were ready to go home for the weekend			1
the seven men and five women deciding the fate of dr. @entity12 , who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 death of the pop icon , will resume deliberations monday morning			1
@entity19 and @entity20 , the parents of the @entity18 , were so anxious for a verdict that they spent friday afternoon in a hotel near the courthouse so they could get there quickly			0
dozens of @entity5 fans filled the plaza outside of the downtown @entity28 courthouse , shouting slogans , waving signs and sometimes arguing with @entity12 supporters			1
the jury heard from 49 witnesses over 23 days , including @entity12 's girlfriends and patients , @entity5 's former employees , investigators , and medical experts for each side			1
prosecutor @entity40 told them thursday the evidence that @entity12 caused @entity5 's death is " overwhelming " and " abundantly clear , " while defense lawyer @entity44 argued no crime was committed			1
" if it were anybody else but @entity5 , would this doctor be here today ? " @entity49 asked , saying it 's a negligence case that should instead be heard by the state medical board			2
" he was just a little fish in a big , dirty pond , " @entity49 said , pointing the finger at other doctors who treated @entity5 , and at @entity5 himself			0
the singer 's death on june 25 , 2009 , was caused by acute propofol intoxication in combination with two sedatives , the @entity28 coroner ruled			0
jurors must decide if the overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol was infused into @entity5 's blood by a steady iv drip , as the prosecution contends , or if @entity5 injected himself with a syringe left nearby by @entity12 , as the defense argues			1
prosecutors argue that @entity12 's use of propofol in @entity5 's home to treat his insomnia was so reckless it was criminally negligent			1
" @entity12 left @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 without a father , " @entity40 said			0
" for them , this case does n't end today , or tomorrow			0
for @entity5 's children , this case will go on forever , because they do not have a father			2
they do not have a father because of the actions of @entity12			2
" @entity40 argued that until @entity5 's death , no one ever heard of propofol being in a home every night to put someone to sleep			2
he called it " a pharmaceutical experiment on @entity5 ... an obscene experiment			0
" the defense contends @entity5 self - administered the fatal overdose of drugs in a desperate search for sleep without @entity12 's knowing			1
" what they 're really asking you to do is to convict dr. @entity12 for the actions of @entity5 , " @entity49 said			1
after @entity49 finished his arguments , @entity40 attacked the defense for trying to blame " everybody but @entity12 , poor @entity12			1
" " if allowed more time to argue , i am sure they would find a way to blame @entity5 's son , @entity75 , " @entity40 said in his rebuttal			2
@entity40 painted @entity12 as a selfish doctor who agreed to take $ 150,000 a month to give @entity5 nightly infusions of propofol in his home , something an ethical doctor would never do because of the dangers			1
while @entity5 was hooked up to a constant intravenous drip of propofol , @entity12 was not paying attention , the prosecutor said			1
telephone records and testimony showed he was talking to @entity125 , a @entity127 cocktail waitress , when he realized @entity5 had stopped breathing			0
" what was so important to @entity12 that he had to call @entity130 at that time ? what was so important to this doctor that he needed to call one of his female friends in @entity127 ? what was so pressing that he just could n't care for @entity5 , that he had to call @entity130 ? " it will never be known how long @entity5 had not been breathing when @entity12 dropped the phone in the middle of his conversation with @entity130 , the prosecutor said			1
" was @entity12 in another room ? did @entity5 yell out for help ? did he gasp ? did he choke ? were there sounds ? we do n't know and we 'll never know , because of the neglect and negligence of @entity12			1
" @entity40 questioned why @entity12 waited at least 20 minutes after he found @entity5 was not breathing before he asked a security guard call for an ambulance			1
" to speak to a 911 operator was the only hope of @entity5 being revived to see another day , " @entity40 said			0
paramedics arrived just four minutes after the call , but too late to save @entity5 , he said			0
@entity49 argued that @entity12 depended on chef @entity153 to send up a security guard while he was trying to revive @entity5 , but she only sent son @entity75			1
when @entity12 spoke with police two days after @entity5 's death , it was " to get ahead of the story , " because he knew there would be toxicology reports showing he died from propofol and sedatives , @entity40 said			1
" unfortunately , his version does n't match up with the evidence , the phone records , the e-mails , but he knew what toxicology findings would show , " @entity40 said			0
jurors heard from two anesthesiology experts who offered competing theories , dr. @entity171 for the prosecution and dr. @entity173 for the defense			0
@entity40 attacked @entity173 for his determination " to find a theory or way to blame it on @entity5			0
" @entity173 testified that the levels of propofol and sedatives found in @entity5 's stomach , blood and urine during the autopsy convinced him that @entity5 swallowed a large does of lorazepam and later gave himself a rapid injection of propofol , which led to his death			2
" what you were presented from dr. @entity173 was junk science , " @entity40 said			0
@entity49 defended his expert and attacked @entity171 , saying he was " not a scientist ; he was an advocate			0
he was trying to prove a point ; he was trying to prove a case			0
" " dr. @entity173 knows more about propofol than dr. @entity171 will ever , ever know , " @entity49 said			0
@entity171 testified that the " only scenario " in @entity5 's death was one involving an iv drip system infusing a steady flow of propofol into @entity5 over several hours before his death			1
@entity49 argued that the prosecution fabricated the theory because they " desperately needed a drip , " because " without a drip , what dr. @entity12 gave @entity5 would not have harmed him			1
" " if dr. @entity12 did what he said he did , there was no danger to @entity5 , " @entity49 said			1
" @entity5 was not going to die and it does n't matter if you leave the room and go outside and play basketball			2
" @entity49 attacked the credibility of @entity217 , @entity5 's former bodyguard , who testified that he saw a propofol bottle inside an empty saline bag suspended on an iv stand by @entity5 's bed			1
@entity217 waited two months after @entity5 's death to tell the story , @entity49 said			2
" all of a sudden , his story becomes monumentally more compelling and more valuable , " @entity49 said			0
@entity217 acknowledged he turned down a $ 500,000 offer for an interview , @entity49 said			0
" do you honestly believe that @entity217 is not going to cash in ? " @entity227 , who placed the 911 call from @entity5 's bedroom , also testified he helped remove @entity5 from the bed and performed cpr on him , but a paramedic contradicted that testimony			2
investigators who found the cut saline bag and propofol bottle never photographed them together or document the bottle being inside the bag , @entity49 said			0
the " bottle in a bag " theory was even less believable because the propofol bottle had a plastic strip attached to it so it could be hung from an iv stand , he said			0
that strip was never used , both sides agreed			0
" dr. @entity12 did n't have to go through the ridiculous , absurd step of cutting a bag , propping it up into a cut iv bag , hanging it up where it could fall , " @entity49 said			2
@entity12 , if convicted , faces up to four years in prison and the loss of his medical license .			0
