-- @entity1 has dealt a tremendous blow to unions , approving a right - to - work measure in the heart of organized labor 's industrial stronghold			1
the new law -- passed by legislators and signed hours later on tuesday -- not only signals a change in @entity12 's so - called @entity11 , but is also the latest sign that the power of organized labor is shrinking in the @entity12			1
@entity12 unions already have a fraction of the influence they did a few decades ago			1
only about 12 % of workers are union members , down from 20 % in 1983 , according to federal data			0
in the private sector , the plunge has been even steeper : union membership has dropped from 17 % in 1983 to 7 % today			0
that 's partly because certain unionized industries have become a smaller part of the overall work force , particularly in manufacturing			1
it 's also a result of government action			2
@entity1 has become the 24th state to adopt a right - to - work law , which removes the requirement for people to pay unions to work at unionized agencies , effectively decreasing union funding and making it less likely that workers choose to organize			1
@entity12 's up and down relationship with unions @entity44 supporters in @entity1 did n't go down without a fight			1
they staged a rally outside the state capitol in @entity48 as lawmakers voted			2
" people need to wake up and fight , " teacher @entity50 said at tuesday 's rally			2
" people need to realize what unions have done for them			0
who gave people the 40 - hour work week ? who fought for workplace safety ? who brought you the weekend ? who brought you workers comp ? who gave people overtime pay ? " " @entity44 ! " protesters shouted after each of her questions			1
faces of the ' right to work ' protest for much of @entity12 history , unions have been credited with helping millions achieve the @entity12 dream and criticized for " heavy - handed " operations ( they were also reviled for corruption in the days of @entity79			1
but unions have long remained a force to be reckoned with			0
today , @entity1 becomes the latest state in the @entity11 , the heart of @entity12 's manufacturing industry , to chip away at their power			1
earlier this year , @entity86 had its own showdown over the power of unions when gov. @entity90 -- who opposes unions -- overcame an attempt to recall him from office			0
the failed recall vote was fueled by anger over laws he pushed that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions			0
@entity99 also passed a right - to - work law this year			1
while there have been moments of good news for organized labor , including pay bumps for @entity108 autoworkers , industry analysts agree that organized labor no longer holds the sway it once did among @entity12 's workers			1
so why the downfall of @entity12 unions ? that depends on who you ask			1
blaming big business big businesses are behind campaigns to squelch organized labor , and they are seeing some success , according to @entity121 , a political science professor and opponent of right - to - work laws			1
what right to work really means " the anti-union campaigns of the last three years , starting with @entity86 , have really been driven ... by big national organizations and money , " said @entity121 , a union member and who teaches labor studies at the @entity126			1
" i think an important question to think about is : why are big private companies spending a lot of money and energy fighting public sector unions ? " they want more free trade , lower minimum wage , the right not to pay sick leave , and all those things which are not per se about union contracts			2
but the biggest single opponent they have is the labor movement , even in its shrunken and weaker state			2
" @entity121 blames businesses and key business figures for lobbying to push such laws " not because of what unions are doing now for their own members but to get them out of the way on issues that will affect everybody else			2
" these campaigns stigmatize unions and encourage people who are unemployed to resent unions rather than big business leaders , he argued			1
" their fear is populism , " he said , referring to those who are " at the top of the economy , during downward mobility			0
" " they want the discontent to not be aimed at people running the economy			0
" there 's also an element of fear among those who have jobs , he said			0
in this time of economic uncertainty , workers are afraid to organize because they do n't want to upset their employers and lose their jobs			0
it 's the economy for businesses to recover from the recession and build jobs in @entity12 , they need to get out from under organized labor , according to some analysts			1
and that has led to the decline of union power -- which is good news , they say			0
" unions have lost power in the private sector over time because of competition , globalization , and the fact that they do n't add any value to worker productivity , " said @entity192 , an economist with the @entity193 and a fan of right - to - work laws			1
businesses are responding to today 's realities and " ca n't pay above - market wages forever , " he said			2
" so either they will move work abroad or they will automate to try to get rid of as many workers as they can			0
" union membership by state to build jobs in @entity12 , @entity192 said businesses ca n't be beholden to mandatory collective bargaining , which can increase wages and expenses without increasing profits			1
in recent years , the retirement of baby boomers has fueled anti-union sentiment as some companies struggle to pay pensions as well as health care for the aging population -- benefits that were negotiated through collective bargaining			0
and , @entity192 notes , that pressure comes on top of the economic downturn			0
listen to how unions are bracing for a long battle " unions are going the way of the dinosaur in the @entity12 private sector , which is a good thing for workers and businesses because it will make @entity12 more competitive , " he said			2
" if right - to - work laws extend to the 50 states , then private sector unions will be dead in @entity12			1
" how does @entity192 feel about the death of all private sector unions ? " good riddance , " he said			0
is it all about red vs. blue ? the decline in union strength is also tied to the political battle between @entity251 and @entity252			0
" there has been a recognition by both the unions and people who are not happy with unions in the last 12 years or so that unions have been fundamentally the powerhouse between the @entity251 party and their electoral math , " said @entity253 , lecturer on public policy with @entity256 's @entity255			0
unions provide money and put " boots on the ground " to get @entity251 candidates elected			0
if they shrink , so will the money and power of that central blue voting bloc , @entity253 said , adding that " it 's a perfectly rational point of view " for right - wing organizations to take			2
@entity44 organizers did a great deal to push for president @entity279 's re-election in key states , including @entity1			1
the president himself paid a visit to the state this week , voicing his opposition to the state 's right - to - work measure			1
" what we should n't do is take away your rights to bargain for better wages , " @entity279 told workers			0
" these so called right to work laws do n't have to do with economics , they have to do with politics			2
" @entity253 insisted that economic arguments for slicing union strength do n't add up			0
even if unionized workers cost more , they can often prove to be a higher - quality work force that will last , grow and learn new skills , she says			2
@entity253 speaks of her own experience , having served as a union officer at the @entity306			0
she was also a manager and a worker in both unionized and non-unionized agencies			0
she said she does not advocate for or against right - to - work laws			1
@entity310 of the conservative @entity311 rejected the idea that unions ' decline are tied to @entity12 politics			1
he said the changes are being driven " by efforts to attract business , " not an underhanded political effort , he says			0
" we 're coming out of a pretty nasty recession ... businesses understandably do n't want to be unionized			0

@entity1 is the latest ' @entity11 ' state to approve a right - to - work law
it 's the latest sign that organized labor 's influence is waning in the @entity12
some analysts blame heavy *tactics* by big business ; others say it 's just politics
