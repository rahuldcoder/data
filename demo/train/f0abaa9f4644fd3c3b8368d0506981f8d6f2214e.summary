-- pulling @entity4 closer than ever militarily to @entity3 , the embattled nation 's president affirmed thursday his desire to combat " @entity10 aggression " while expressing cautious optimism that peace , even if it 's temporary , could soon be in reach			1
@entity4 president @entity11 spoke from the @entity3 summit in @entity13 about new steps strengthening his country 's security partnership with the @entity19 - @entity18 alliance following months of fighting against what he claims are @entity10 - backed -- despite @entity24 's denials -- rebels			1
this fighting has gone on for months in spite of rhetoric preaching peace from all sides and a host of diplomatic initiatives , the next of which is a meeting friday in @entity35 ' capital that will include representatives from @entity4 , the rebels and @entity10			1
" as president of @entity4 , ( i am ) ready to do my best to stop the war , " @entity11 said			1
" and ... i have , i can say , a careful optimism for tomorrow 's meeting ... in @entity42 because beforehand ( @entity10 and rebel leaders said ) they are ready for an immediate ceasefire			2
" standing alongside @entity11 , @entity3 secretary general @entity45 said that " the best way forward would be to find a political solution			1
" but he expressed reservations that @entity24 's latest public comments on its desire for peace will be an different than its past ones , after which the violence has ratcheted up rather than slowing down			1
" what counts is what is actually happening on the ground , " said @entity45 , who accused @entity10 of having thousands of troops inside @entity4 who have fired on @entity4 military positions			2
" previously , we have seen similar statements and initiatives			0
and they have actually just been smokescreens for continued @entity10 destabilization			0
" rebels : open to ceasefire with ' a political settlement ' rebel leaders in eastern @entity4 's @entity70 and @entity71 regions said in a joint statement thursday that they would be prepared to order a ceasefire as of 3 p.m. friday " if agreements are achieved and @entity4 officials sign a plan for a political settlement of the conflict			1
" these heads of the self - declared @entity70 and @entity80 will take part in talks in @entity35 on friday , the statement said , when they will present their proposals on ensuring compliance with the plan			0
@entity10 president @entity85 recently presented a seven - point road map to end the conflict in eastern @entity4 , though that plan was quickly dismissed by @entity4 prime minister @entity88 as a rescue plan for @entity91 rebels			2
@entity85 and other @entity93 officials have voiced sympathy for separatists , many of whom are ethnic @entity10 , while harshly criticizing the @entity99 - based government for what they say is a heavy - handed military assault that 's killed innocent civilians and contributed to a humanitarian crisis that 's affected many others			0
but they say they have n't sent @entity10 troops into the war - torn region in eastern @entity4 -- a claim that @entity11 , @entity45 and their allies are n't buying			1
the @entity113 believes @entity10 now has three to five " battalion task groups " conducting military operations inside @entity4 , according to two @entity113 military officials			2
each group can have as many as a thousand troops			0
many more @entity10 troops control the border with @entity4 for thousands of miles -- from @entity123 to @entity70 , the @entity113 officials say			0
@entity3 offers funding , military assistance to @entity4 the reported incursion into @entity4 , and the threat that @entity10 forces could move even deeper into the country and perhaps into neighboring ones , has caught the attention of many in the @entity133			1
" this is the first time since the end of @entity136 that one @entity19 country has tried to grab another 's territory by force , " said @entity45			0
" @entity19 must not turn away from the rule of law to the rule of the strongest			0
" to curb this push , @entity3 is n't sending troops to the front lines in @entity4 , but it is bolstering its partnership with the @entity99 government			1
that includes a focus on improving the @entity4 military 's cyber-defense , logistics and command and control capabilities , as well nearly $ 20 million in @entity3 funding for @entity4 on top of other monetary contributions from its member states , @entity45 said			1
furthermore , @entity11 said there 's a push to achieve " full interoperability between @entity4 and @entity3 " plus systemic reforms that could lead to @entity4 some day formally joining the alliance			1
that would be significant because all @entity3 forces are obliged , per the terms of the alliance , to come to the defense of any other @entity3 member country that 's been invaded			2
" a friend in need is a friend indeed , " @entity11 said			0
" and ( what @entity3 countries have done so far ) was a very strong demonstration of solidarity with @entity4			1
" president : ' @entity4 ... pays the highest price , every single day ' while the sides offer divergent views about who is involved and who is to blame , there 's no doubt the violence -- for now , at least -- is in full swing			1
@entity185 spokesman @entity184 told reporters thursday that @entity10 continues to fly reconnaissance drones over its territory and shell @entity4 military positions			2
in the town of @entity193 , for instance , @entity4 troops are being shelled and are nearly surrounded , @entity184 said from @entity99			0
a @entity0 team in @entity195 saw a large plume of smoke from artillery fire less than three miles from the main @entity4 checkpoint heading out of the southeastern port city toward the border town of @entity202 , which @entity99 said last week was seized by @entity10 troops			0
another @entity0 staffer with a @entity4 spotter unit about six miles east of @entity195 witnessed sustained artillery bombardment of the area , with firing on a wide front and coming from the @entity10 border area			0
this indicates that the rebel positions are now are much closer to the city than they were previously			0
@entity11 said ending the conflict -- which since mid-april has cost the lives of about 840 @entity4 troops , with over 3,000 more injured -- will require @entity10 to pull back its troops from @entity4 and from the border			2
" @entity4 ( is the ) object of the aggression , and we have have to do our best ( to ) immediately stop the aggression , " the president said			2
" why ? because it is exactly @entity4 that pays the highest price , every single day			0
" @entity0 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 , as well as journalist @entity232 , contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 is bolstering its military partnership with @entity3 , @entity11 says
he says he 's " ready ... to stop the war , " hopes talks with rebels lead to peace
