-- @entity1 is n't the only sorry actor in @entity3			2
after the 27 - year - old announced that he 's performing in an art piece called " @entity9 " this week in @entity10 , actors such as @entity5 and @entity6 are turning @entity1 's apologetic saga into a punchline			1
on wednesday , @entity5 actually opened his own exhibit right next to @entity1 's called " @entity14 " for @entity15			1
. @entity16 stopped by both @entity1 's performance -- during which visitors take an " implement , " such as a " @entity22 " toy or bottle of cologne , into a small room where @entity1 sits silently with a bag over his head -- and @entity5 's , and found that @entity5 could be guilty of plagiarizing @entity1 's show			1
considering that @entity1 is facing accusations of plagiarism with his " @entity32 " show anyway , @entity5 's rip - off of @entity1 's exhibit is " is obviously the point , " buzzfeed notes			1
like @entity1 , @entity5 's set - up involves a table of items that occasionally reference his career : where @entity1 had nods to " transformers , " " @entity41 " and a copy of @entity44 ' book , " the @entity45 , " @entity5 included a dvd of " @entity47 " and a toy kangaroo ( 2003 's " @entity50 , " anyone ? )			1
but unlike @entity1 , who never clarifies exactly what he 's apologizing for , @entity5 was an open book			1
he , too , wore a paper bag over his head -- one saying " @entity54 " instead of @entity1 's " @entity55 " -- but eagerly apologized for " all the world 's ills " and even offered one guy a taste of his sandwich			1
@entity5 explained to @entity16 that he was n't doing it to upset @entity1 -- in fact , he found the actor 's exhibit pretty inspiring			1
" everyone 's talking about it , whether you want to call it art or a real apology , it 's hilarious , " @entity5 said			1
" he 's getting people talking			2
i 'm all for this artsy gallery thing			0
it 's fun to parody because all i have to do here is sit with a bag on my head , crying , and saying , ' i sowwy			2
' but i have to tell you ; it 's freeing to continually apologize like he does			0
the " @entity83 " actor went on a tweet - spree wednesday airing all of his regrets			0
" i am not famous to begin with , " @entity6 joked			2
" i am beginning to feel slightly more famous			0
... i take it back , still not famous			0
" and then : " i am ... confused about how famous or not famous i might potentially be ... anymore ... i am ... @entity90			0
" just in case @entity1 thinks @entity6 is laughing at him instead of with him , the actor clarified that " in all @entity93 , i love @entity1 , whether or not he 's famous			1
... i am sorry i even said sorry			0
not gon @entity96 , i am only about fifty percent @entity97 ( first ) sorry			0
" in december , @entity1 was accused of plagiarizing @entity44 ' " @entity100 , " in his short film , " @entity101			2
" the actor at first said that he 'd been so absorbed in the creative process he neglected to give @entity104 proper accreditation , but then he was also accused of plagiarizing his apologies			0
all of these regrets makes us wonder : who do you want to see apologize next ?			0
