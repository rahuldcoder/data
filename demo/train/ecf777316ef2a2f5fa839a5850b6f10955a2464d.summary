" damn they change the # signlanguagelady ... we want @entity20 ! ! ! ! " @ @entity21 posted			2
@entity5 , 30 , became an internet sensation just three days earlier because of the dramatic facial expressions and body language she used to translate @entity13 's dire warnings about the dangers coming with @entity27			1
@entity30 's @entity29 , during wednesday night 's " @entity28 , " said @entity5 's " expressive sign - language interpreting turned disaster press briefings into an @entity34 sign - language recital			1
" " if you 're in your home or somewhere safe where you can remain , stay there , " @entity2 said			0
" the time for relocation or evacuation is over			0
conditions outside are dangerous , and they 're only going to get worse in the hours ahead			0
" @entity3 after @entity27 : a tale of two cities when the mayor talked about falling trees , high winds , heavy rain and rising waters , @entity5 made sure her face , hands and body conveyed the urgency to those who could not hear			1
a falling tree took both arms to convey			0
one arm was the ground , and the other was the tree			0
when @entity2 warned " it is dangerous , " viewers could see the danger on @entity5 ' face			2
as the mayor scolded two @entity3 who had been arrested trying to surf the rolling waves of @entity69 , calling it " just an outrage , " the outrage was clear in her expression			1

the mayor 's news conferences became must - see tv for her new fans			1
but @entity5 herself was staying out of the spotlight , apparently giving just one interview to @entity96 reporter @entity95 , who tracked her down at the @entity3 emergency management headquarters in @entity98 on wednesday			1
" as you can see from when i 'm interpreting , you see the tree falling , you see the building , you see the crane moving around , " @entity5 told @entity99			2
" because i need to have those pictures for the deaf people that need @entity110 , " or @entity110			0
engineers : dangling crane tied securely to @entity3 building her dramatic expressions , gestures and body language are needed to communicate the urgent message , she said			1

" @entity13 's new signer does her job fine , but she does n't have panache of @entity5 , who signed with a @entity3 accent			1
bring her back ! " posted @ @entity155			0
" awww what happened ? @entity13 did n't like all the shine @entity5 was getting ? or did they just finally give her a break ? " @ @entity160 wrote			0

@entity5 has remained mostly silent , not jumping into the @entity3 media circus -- yet			1
