-- @entity1 stated monday that president @entity3 " has not signed one new free - trade agreement in the past four years			1
" " i 'll reverse that failure , " the @entity5 presidential nominee said			0
but is his assertion true ? the facts : while he angered his allies in organized labor , @entity3 secured congressional approval of free - trade deals with @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , and signed them in october 2011			1
the term " new " in @entity1 's remarks concerning trade deals appears to be a reference to the fact that work on the three separate trade agreements began in 2007 , when @entity22 was president			2
but it was @entity3 who re-negotiated the passage of the three deals with a @entity27 that has been identified more for its legislative gridlock , than its passage of such deals			0
fact check : was @entity3 ' silent ' on @entity34 2009 protests ? " it takes a lot of capital to get trade deals through @entity27 , and it 's particularly tough to do when the economy is weak , " said @entity35 , senior fellow at @entity36			0
in a rare moment of bipartisanship in @entity44 , house speaker @entity45 , @entity46 , issued a statement on the day @entity3 signed the agreement saying " years of perseverance have been rewarded today as @entity51 job creators will have new opportunities to expand and hire as they access new markets abroad			1
" @entity3 re-negotiated aspects of the deal with @entity15 to secure additional market access for @entity51 auto manufacturers			2
he also added language into the deal with @entity13 to protect the rights of @entity13 workers , and addressed concerns with tax transparency in @entity14			2
speaking with reporters monday aboard @entity68 as the president traveled to @entity70 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 campaign challenged @entity1 's assertion that @entity3 had not signed a " new " free - trade agreement			1
" that is not only absurd , it 's inaccurate , " said @entity73 , traveling press secretary for the @entity3 campaign			2
" he 's basing it on an absurd premise that president @entity22 signed a couple of trade agreements , but the fact remains that the president renegotiated the trade agreements -- made them better for @entity51 workers , made them better for the @entity51 auto industry and the @entity51 meat industry -- and that 's why we not only got them through @entity27 , but the president actually signed them into law			0
" fact check : did @entity3 say he wants ' daylight ' between @entity51 , @entity98 ? in addition to the three trade agreements , @entity3 has continued the @entity22 administration 's effort to form a trans - @entity104 free - trade zone , which would include up to 11 economies across the @entity106			1
the fourteenth round of negotiations for the proposed zone took place last month in @entity111 , @entity112 , with another round scheduled to take place in @entity115 in december			0
the administration has said its goal in continuing the negotiations is to support the creation of jobs in the @entity51 , and an increase in exports to a region that represents more than 40 % of global trade			0
the @entity3 administration is also exploring the possibility of free - trade talks with the 27 - nation @entity128			1
a decision on whether to launch such negotiations is expected soon			0
an economist who follows trade policy , though , says that pursuing free - trade deals does not appear to be a top priority of the @entity3 administration			1
administration officials are " not very enthusiastic " about negotiating new free - trade agreements in the current political environment , according to @entity136 , a senior fellow in economic studies at the @entity138 , a nonpartisan @entity44 think tank			1
fact check : @entity1 's comparison of past , present @entity144 pointless with the expiration of fast - track trade negotiation authority in 2007 , any agreement started by the administration would go through an amendments process , as opposed to a straight up - or - down vote in the @entity151			2
in the absence of fast - track authority , no country would put their best offers forward in negotiations with the executive branch if that would only be amended as it traveled through both houses of @entity27 , said @entity136			0
" neither side trusts the other when it comes to trade " in today 's polarized political environment , so movement is not likely as long as the executive and legislative branches are controlled by different parties , added @entity136			0
conclusion : while president @entity3 continued trade agreements begun under the previous administration , it is not accurate to assert that @entity3 has not signed any free trade agreements when , in fact , he has done so with @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity13			1
