@entity1 prime minister @entity0 signed the political elements of a trade pact with the @entity4 on friday , even as @entity6 lawmakers finalized annexation of @entity1 's @entity8			1
the signing in @entity10 signals @entity12 's solidarity with @entity1 -- and carries additional symbolic force because it was the decision by @entity1 president @entity14 in november to ditch the trade pact in favor of closer ties with @entity6 that triggered the protests that led to his ouster in february and spiraled into the current crisis			1
it also comes a day after the @entity4 and the @entity23 slapped sanctions on @entity6 lawmakers and businessmen ; @entity6 responded with its own list of sanctions against a number of @entity23 lawmakers and officials			1
in another sign of defiance , @entity6 president @entity32 , flanked by the speakers of both houses of @entity35 , signed a treaty friday finalizing the accession to @entity6 of the @entity8 region and its port city of @entity42			1
the upper house unanimously approved ratification of the treaty a day after @entity6 's lower house of @entity35 , the @entity47 , passed it by an overwhelming margin			1
the political crisis has been the biggest blow to @entity6 's relations with the @entity52 since the @entity53			1
in a sign that @entity52 sanctions are already weighing on @entity6 authorities , finance minister @entity55 said friday in @entity59 that the government will have to pay more to borrow money , state news agency @entity54 said			2
@entity6 " will look at our oil and gas revenues			0
if the situation is like it is now , we will probably have to give up external borrowings and cut domestic ones , " @entity55 said			0
@entity0 : @entity4 speaking in one voice @entity59 has doggedly pursued its own course even as @entity52 leaders have denounced its actions as violations of @entity1 's sovereignty and a breach of international law			1
though @entity6 insists that its actions are legitimate , @entity1 's interim government has said @entity77 will never stop fighting for @entity8			1
@entity78 said in a statement friday that it has concluded that the international law of occupation applies to @entity6 forces in @entity8			1
" the occupying party is ultimately responsible for violations of international law committed by local authorities or proxy forces , " it said			0
while in @entity10 , @entity0 held talks with @entity90 president @entity89 and @entity92 chief @entity91			0
he said @entity6 's ratification of the treaty annexing @entity8 is less important than the @entity4 trade pact he has signed with @entity4 leaders			1
" frankly speaking , i do n't care about @entity6 signing this deal ; i care about @entity1 , @entity1 and our @entity12 future , " he said			1
" this deal covers more existential and most important issues , mainly security and defense cooperation			0
" @entity0 said the @entity4 would " speak in one single and strong voice " to protect its values and defend @entity1 's territorial integrity			1

those targeted with travel bans and asset freezes include @entity6 deputy prime minister @entity122 , as well as the chairwoman of the @entity6 upper house , @entity125 , and two @entity32 advisers			2
" sanctions are not a question of retaliation ; they are a foreign policy tool , " @entity89 said			0
" our goal is to stop @entity6 action against @entity1 , to restore @entity1 's sovereignty , and to achieve this , we need a negotiated solution			1
" he said the @entity4 expected soon to finalize approval of the remaining parts of the deal , particularly its economic provisions			2
@entity142 prime minister @entity141 said the @entity92 will draw up further sanctions -- in finance , military and energy -- for use if the situation escalates			2
" @entity12 is , i think , 25 % or so reliant on @entity6 gas , " he said			2
" but if you look at @entity152 's revenues , something like 50 % of them come from @entity12			2
so , you know , @entity6 needs @entity12 more than @entity12 needs @entity6			2
" @entity141 said the measures agreed to in @entity10 will carry a cost for @entity8 , whose goods would face heavy penalties and tariffs in @entity12 if they are shipped through @entity6 , not @entity1			1
