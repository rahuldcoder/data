@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly two years after arriving in @entity4 with the promise of a new nose and ears , @entity3 has finally begun the process of reconstructive surgery			1
the young @entity11 woman , whose face was mutilated by her @entity14 husband and in - laws , checked into @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity1 , early thursday morning			1
after nearly six hours , the first of about six anticipated surgeries -- which will be performed over the course of up to two years -- is now complete , said @entity21 , who along with his wife has been caring for @entity3			1
" i woke her up at 5 a.m. , " he said thursday night , recounting how the day began			0
" she said , ' @entity24 ' -- that 's what she calls me , @entity27 -- ' let me sleep			2
' i said , ' you have an operation today , ' and she jumped			0
as soon as i said that , she jumped ! she was ready ! " her spirits were high going in , he said			0
she was laughing and chatting with her doctors			0
because of privacy regulations , @entity2 was not on hand thursday and doctors were prevented from speaking directly about her case			1
the haunting story and image of @entity3 , now 22 , became known the world over after her face appeared on the cover of @entity43 in august 2010			1
that same month she arrived in @entity45 , welcomed with the best of intentions by people wanting to help her start over with a new and restored face			2
but @entity3 , who effectively became a poster child for the oppression of women in @entity11 , was n't emotionally prepared for the grueling process that awaited her			1
until now , and amid several moves , that hoped - for surgery remained elusive			2
in may , 16 months after meeting @entity3 , @entity2 published an exclusive piece documenting her complicated and winding journey in @entity4			1
we set out to tell her story because the last the world knew , she was well on her way to a fairytale ending			2
we wanted readers to understand the truth : that fairytale endings are n't always possible , especially for someone with @entity3 's challenges			1
the responses from readers were overwhelming			0
some messages we received were more surprising than others			0
many wanted to give donations to support @entity3			1
others offered their own stories , tips to pass along to those caring for @entity3 , as well as medical and psychological diagnoses			1
people in @entity11 -- @entity4 troops , ngo workers and a @entity83 blogger -- reached out , as did a man who knew her on the base where she first was brought after being brutalized and left to die			1
a @entity87 in the fitness business asked to send @entity90 workout clothes -- with the hope that someday she might interview @entity3 for a program she calls " @entity94			1
" someone in @entity96 offered to choreograph and teach @entity3 her very own @entity98 dance			1
a poet penned a piece to honor her			0
@entity3 and the @entity0 , @entity1 , couple caring for her , @entity21 and @entity102 , need the well wishes and good vibes now more than ever			1
this medical odyssey will be a long and difficult one			0
the team assembled to work with @entity3 did their best -- even putting together a three - hour presentation , the @entity107 say -- to prepare all of them for what was to come			1
" finally , she took the first step , " @entity102 said thursday night			0
" i hope everything will be good			0
" a week before her surgery , we sat down with @entity3 and her adopted family , including her 14 - year - old " sister , " @entity117 , to talk about how they were feeling			1
" i 'm not scared			0
i 'm happy , " @entity3 said , sitting between @entity102 and @entity117 , all three of them wearing necklaces @entity3 created			1
given all she 's been through , the years of abuse and the mutilation of her face , surgery is nothing to be afraid of , she said in @entity126			2
" i suffered a lot in my life , " she said , as @entity102 translated			0
" now i feel that a light comes into my life			0
" she held hands with @entity117 , with whom she 's become very close , the two only letting go to unwrap and chomp on chocolates plucked from a heart - shaped candy box in front of them			1
the next day @entity117 , @entity102 's daughter by her first husband , was boarding a plane to spend a month in @entity138 with her father and family there			1
@entity117 said she was sorry she would n't be around after the initial surgery , but she knows that she and @entity142 will talk and visit with each other by @entity144			0
@entity117 looked over at @entity90 with a grin and gave her own prediction of how things will go : " i 'm pretty sure , once she gets all her surgery , she 'll have a lot of guys drooling			0
" " @entity152 , @entity117 ! " @entity3 screamed , her eyes as wide as her smile as she play - swatted her friend			1
the @entity156 and @entity3 said they were ready for what awaits them			1
this is what she 's wanted for so long , and they take great comfort in the confidence they have in the doctors who will be caring for her			2
@entity167 , the shortened name for the facility that combines the former @entity170 and the @entity16 , is the world 's largest military medical center			1
@entity4 rep. @entity173 and his office secured @entity3 's treatment at the medical center			1
that the military , so often associated with violence , would step up to do this fills the @entity1 @entity180 with pride			0
people " know we take care of wounded soldiers			0
that 's kind of an obligation ; what else could you do ? but this -- you do n't have to do this			2
... it puts a real human face on our military , " he said			0
" how can your heart not go out to @entity3 ? " @entity3 will also have additional support from @entity199 , @entity102 's cousin , who introduced @entity3 to the @entity107			1
@entity199 , who lives in @entity200 about an hour away from the @entity201 in @entity1 , travels often			0
but she said she has carved out time to be there after the surgery and is prepared to help care for @entity3 during her recovery			2
@entity199 marvels at @entity3 's smile and ability to be loving , despite all she 's been through			1
" she has this innocence about her , but she 's also very smart and she understands things , @entity199 said recently of @entity90			2
" i think she has , and i hope she has , a brighter future			0
" the road will not be an easy one to travel			0
over the course of her multiple surgeries , there will be plenty of pain and discomfort , not to mention the emotional toll she will experience as she watches herself look far worse before she will look better			2
thursday 's surgery , which set her up to have skin in her forehead expanded for future use in rebuilding her nose , is only the beginning , @entity27 said			2
but by the time he left her room thursday evening , he said she seemed more than up for the challenge			0
" she 's in a private room			0
she had a hamburger , fruit , ice cream and yogurt			0
and did i say fruit ? she ate like a pig , " he said with a tired laugh			0
" it 's only beginning , but it was very successful			0
" to support @entity3 in her surgical journey , @entity244 is asking people who have undergone reconstructive surgery to share their stories			1
submitted videos will be pieced together and played for @entity3 so she knows she is not alone			2
the family caring for @entity3 has also set up a website , @entity252 , so people can follow her progress , send her notes , make direct donations to her personal account and even reach out to buy her handcrafted jewelry			2
all this , the @entity259 hope , will help @entity3 gain the life she deserves			2
