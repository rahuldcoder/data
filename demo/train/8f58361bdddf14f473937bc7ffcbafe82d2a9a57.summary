-- reigning world champion @entity1 has started the 2011 @entity3 season as he finished the last , claiming pole position in qualifying ahead of sunday 's season - opening @entity6 @entity5 in @entity7			1
the @entity10 driver 's lap of one minute and 23.529 seconds was enough to keep him 0.778 seconds ahead of @entity12 's @entity11 , who will join him on the front row			1
@entity1 's @entity6 teammate @entity15 finished third fastest in front of his home crowd , with @entity11 's fellow @entity12 driver @entity18 in fourth position at @entity21			1
two - time world champion @entity22 will start from fifth on the grid for @entity24 and @entity25 of @entity26 will also be on the third row after a lap of one minute 25.247 earned him sixth position			1
will tires decide new @entity3 season ? seven - time champion @entity33 's qualifying woes from the 2010 campaign continued after he was eliminated at the end of the second round , which means the @entity38 driver will start from 11th position			1
@entity33 's fellow @entity41 and teammate @entity40 qualified in seventh ahead of @entity24 's @entity43 in eighth , @entity45 of @entity46 in ninth and @entity48 's @entity47 in 10th			1
@entity1 recorded the fastest lap without using the newly re-introduced kers technology , which stores energy created when breaking and converts it into an extra boost of speed			2
" we did n't use it today and the reason for that will stay a secret ! " the 23 - year - old told @entity3 's official website			2
" it was a very good day today and so far a very good weekend , and hopefully this will lead to our best @entity7 result ever			0
@entity3 2011 lowdown " the gap ( between @entity11 's time and @entity1 's time ) is almost irrelevant			2
it could be one thousandth or one second			0
you only have those eight meters between you and the guy in second position , nothing more , nothing less			0
and in a long race eight meters may mean very little			0
" it was a disastrous session for @entity77 - based team @entity76 , who saw both of their drivers fall foul of a rule which states any driver whose best lap is not within of 107 % of the fastest lap time in the first qualifying phase will not be allowed to take place in the race			0
as a result , @entity91 's @entity90 and @entity92 of @entity93 will not line - up on the grid for sunday 's race .			0
