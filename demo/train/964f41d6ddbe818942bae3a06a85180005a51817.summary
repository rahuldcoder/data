-- while much of the talk has been about @entity3 and @entity4 ahead of this week 's @entity5 , @entity1 has been happy to slide under the radar			1
world no. 1 @entity3 won an exhibition in @entity9 and reached the final of the @entity12 teams event in @entity13 despite a surprise defeat to young @entity16 @entity15 , while third - ranked @entity4 impressively retained his @entity18 title			1
by contrast , @entity1 , the most successful male player in tennis history , has been largely inactive			2
his last serious on - court action was an exhibition tour of @entity23 in december			1
" it 's been very relaxing , the last one and a half months , " the 17 - time grand slam champion told reporters ahead of his bid for a fifth @entity28 crown			1
" i arrived really early -- two , three days earlier than in the past -- which has been quite nice			0
" i purposely did n't play a lead - up tournament so that i 'd be fresh for the beginning , hopefully going deep into the tournament			2
that 's the goal , obviously			2
" the 31 - year - old last won the season 's opening grand slam in 2010 , and was beaten in the quarterfinals 12 months ago before going on to win @entity41 for a record - equaling seventh time and surpassing @entity44 ' milestone of total weeks at the top of the rankings			1
" i 'm ready to go and eager			0
that , to me , right now dominates , " the @entity48 star said			1
" i think as long as that 's the case , that means i love it very much			2
" today i take much more pleasure out of doing the gym work than i ever have			0
today things for me make sense			0
i know why i 'm doing them			0
i know they 're necessary			0
" having surrendered the no. 1 ranking to @entity3 at the end of last season , @entity1 was revived by his trip to @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 -- largely untapped markets for tennis			1
" it was one of the most fascinating trips of my life , " @entity1 said			2
" i was deeply impressed by the atmosphere , by the love for the game , for the appreciation they showed for me showing up			0
" he will start his 53rd grand slam tournament against 46th - ranked @entity78 @entity77 , and as second seed he can not meet two - time defending champion @entity3 until the final			1
" i know i wo n't win all the tournaments i enter , " @entity1 said			1
" but it 's important that i enjoy it and i try as hard as i can and put myself deep in the tournaments like i did last year			0
i play to win every match right now			2
" @entity3 is one of nine players who have won successive @entity5 titles , and the @entity88 is seeking to be the first to make it three in a row			1
" i like playing here because it 's after probably five , six , seven weeks of break with no official tournament , " he said at his pre-tournament conference			0
" so you get time to recover , regroup , recharge your batteries mentally , physically , try to get ready for the new season with four , five weeks of good practice			0
you 're motivated and inspired to play some good tennis			0
" the 25 - year - old will also start against a @entity78 , playing @entity107 on monday , and his run to the final could see him face @entity1 's 15th - seeded compatriot @entity110 in round four , then @entity104 no. 5 @entity102 and @entity105 no. 4 @entity101			1
two - time finalist @entity4 , who beat @entity3 in the @entity113 final to win his first grand slam , is in @entity1 's half of the draw while 2012 @entity28 runner - up @entity117 is not yet ready to make his comeback			1
" it is definitely a loss for the tournament , for tennis , for sport in general not to have @entity117 playing still on the court			0
it 's been , what , seven months since he 's played his last official match , " @entity3 said			2
" i 'm sure if he felt he was ready enough to play this tournament , best - of - five in the @entity16 summer that can be brutal and difficult to play , then he would come			1
he probably felt he needs more time to recover			0
i wish him a speedy recovery			0
