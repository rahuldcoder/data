@entity0 , @entity1 -- an international medical group has cleared a @entity1 biopharmaceutical company in the deaths of two patients following stem cell procedures in other countries			1
" it is not our conclusion that stem cells killed these patients , " @entity9 , the executive director of the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , said in a news conference in @entity0 tuesday			0
the @entity1 media reported last month that two patients who had received stem cell procedures in @entity19 and @entity20 had died , and cited allegations that @entity22 had lured clients to clinics overseas to skirt domestic laws banning stem cell treatment			1
the @entity10 refuted the charges , citing forensic evidence it had gathered from @entity29 , medical records and interviews from @entity19 and @entity20			1
" it is very important that we distinguish the words cause and correlation , " said bioethicist @entity32 , who participated in the @entity10 investigation			0
he explained that the dangers of the medical procedures undertaken in the treatments does not mean the stem cells used in the therapy are dangerous			2
the @entity10 is the largest multinational group of physicians studying the use of adult stem cells and tracks the cases of about 700 patients around the world who receive treatment			2
potential dangers cited in the media about carcinogenic cell growth pertain only to embryonic stem cells and is unrelated to the treatment with adult stem cells that is cited in the investigation , according to the group			2
no deaths have been reported in the cases registered with the society , according to @entity9			0
the two patients from @entity29 were not registered with the @entity10 , although the bio company does participate in patient registry with the group			0
in the first of the two cases , a 61 - year - old man traveled to @entity20 for treatment with stem cells provided by @entity29 for diabetes and other ailments			0
he died two months later			0
his cause of death has not been determined , but it is " unlikely " the result of the stem cell procedure , according to the @entity10			1
the death of a 73 - year - old former surgeon , who died on the same day he was treated in @entity19 , " was due to a pre-existing blood clot that traveled to the lungs , and may have been precipitated by the procedure used to infuse the stem cells , or less probably , from a clot formed by the cells , " according to the @entity10 findings published on the group 's website			1
stem cell banking is allowed in clinics such as @entity29 , which specializes in extracting , cultivating and storing adult stem cells obtained from fatty tissue of patients			1
patients are only able to receive treatment with these stored cells overseas , and @entity22 regularly refers patients to clinics in other countries that are determined capable of using their stem cells			0
no financial exchanges are made for these referrals , according to @entity101 , the company 's public relations director			0
the @entity10 also concluded in its report that no financial transaction could be traced to @entity29 from the clinics that conducted the stem cell treatments			1
under @entity1 regulations , stem cell treatments are not authorized and can only be used in clinical trials approved by the @entity110 ( @entity110 )			1
the @entity110 and the @entity111 announced they will conduct an investigation into the potential dangers of unauthorized stem cell treatment in the country and create countermeasures , according to a statement from the @entity110 .			2
