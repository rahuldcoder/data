the investigations will likely require lots of time , if similar past cases are any indication			2
last week , @entity48 legal analyst @entity68 said the lack of an indictment could push the federal government to " open a much more stringent and powerful investigation " of @entity7 's shooting			1
protests spread far beyond @entity10 " now they know he 's not going to be prosecuted on a state level , and the feds have a right to do a completely independent investigation , and they 're not bound in any way by grand jury determination , " he said			2
but @entity39 late monday sounded pessimistic about that route			0

such a lawsuit would likely include the fact that @entity7 's body was in the street for four hours after his killing			1
what 's next for @entity10 ? a push for change to the system in a video released last week by @entity150 , @entity7 thanked supporters for trying to end what he called racial profiling and police intimidation			1
