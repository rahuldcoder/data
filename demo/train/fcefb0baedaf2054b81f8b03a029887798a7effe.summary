-- in my first job in high school stocking the shelves with fresh produce at the grocery store , i often saw parents struggling with misbehaving children			2
some would scream , while others would spank their kids			0
it was always awkward to witness , because i felt sympathy for both sides			0
were the children choosing to act out because the parents were busy and stressed buying food ? but surely the parents could think of a better way to handle a defiant child ? i 'm now a researcher at the @entity21 of @entity22 and a specialist in child welfare , and i have just completed a study of this very issue			0
@entity28 colleagues @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 and i published findings in the journal @entity34 ( @entity35 ) this week showing that the children who are spanked by their parents are at greater risk for later problems in both vocabulary and behavior			1
we found that children who were spanked by their mothers at age 5 , even relatively infrequently , went on to have higher levels of behavior problems at age 9 , even after taking into account other family risk factors that also affect child behavior			1
given the chicken vs. egg cyclical nature of this , we also controlled for earlier problems with the children to ensure that it was n't just that kids who acted out were simply being spanked more			1
and 5 - year - olds who were spanked frequently , defined as two or more times a week , by their fathers also went on to have lower vocabulary scores at age 9 , even after controlling for an array of other risk factors and earlier child vocabulary			1
this is an important finding , because few studies in this area have examined effects on cognitive development			0
a leading researcher on child spanking , @entity72 from the @entity74 , correctly suggests that some of these cognitive effects may be indirect rather than a result of spanking only			0
parents who spank may not talk to their children as often , or kids with behavioral problems may be more distracted at school			1
to account for some of these possibilities , we did control for a host of other family factors , such as the mom 's iq , the child 's earlier verbal intelligence , the child 's behavioral problems as well as a measure of how cognitively stimulating the home environment was			1
so , it appears that spanking is having an effect on vocabulary above and beyond those other factors			0
changing people 's minds about something they care about by presenting data is a tough thing to do , particularly around something so emotionally laden as spanking			0
thinking back to my times in that grocery store and what the parents were going through , spanking actually worked for immediate compliance : it gets the child to stop misbehaving			1
the child stops grabbing food off the shelves ; at home , the child stops touching the outlet or breaking his sister 's toy , providing parents with immediate feedback that what they are doing is working			0
but that makes it more difficult to see what is happening in the long term			0
how parents discipline their kids is intimately tied to cultural , religious and family traditions , including the meaning parents attach to their own experiences			1
many of us say to ourselves , " i was spanked as a kid , and it made me a good person			0
so what 's wrong with spanking my own kids ? " this is a very sensitive topic			2
that might explain why , even though the evidence is mounting that spanking leads to the very acting - out behavior most parents want to stop and even hurts a child 's development , many parents in the @entity148 continue to spank			1
more than half of the parents we questioned reported spanking their kids at age 3 and at age 5 , even though our question just focused on spanking in the past month			1
studies that simply look at whether children have been spanked at all find that the vast majority of @entity148 children are still spanked today			0
parents who are interested in exploring alternatives to spanking that might be a good fit for their family can talk to their pediatrician about effective strategies			1
they can also check out healthychildren.org from the @entity173 , which has some guides for parents on communication and discipline techniques			2
perhaps we researchers need to get better at telling the story			0
families sometimes think we are accusing them of abusing their kids and challenging who they are as parents , and in turn they dismiss our findings as coming from out - of - touch academics			2
most parents are doing the best they can by their children and must contend with advice from many corners , whether solicited or not			0
researchers and health practitioners must not lose sight of the burden and stress faced by so many families today , particularly since the tools we hope to see replace spanking sometimes require more upfront effort and consistency in implementation , which can be difficult to maintain without support			1
we also need to do a better job of conveying to parents what they could do instead of spanking			2
parents have a host of tools they can use -- talking , using time - outs and so on -- and all of us who see young parents and children can help demonstrate how effective these other forms of discipline can be			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

@entity218 : spanking gets results but can harm development
he says kids who are spanked are at greater risk for behavior , speech problems
@entity218 : how parents discipline kids is tied to cultural , religious , family traditions
he says researchers and health practitioners must teach parents alternatives to spanking
