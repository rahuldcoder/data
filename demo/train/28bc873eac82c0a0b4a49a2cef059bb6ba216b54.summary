@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was an ethnic twist on an @entity5 classic , the kind of thing that some people consider appealing and others frightening			1
pinto beans , diced tomatoes , salsa and jalapenos top a hot dog that 's grilled to perfection			2
it 's 10 o'clock on a saturday night at ground zero in the immigration debate			1
the hot dog vendor , a woman from the @entity22 state of @entity23 , would normally be doing a brisk business			2
her cart is across the street from a popular @entity28 dance club that used to be frequented by @entity29 but is now normally crammed with @entity22 immigrants			1
" the city feels abandoned , " the woman tells me in @entity34			2
" it sure looks that way during a drive though the city 's predominantly @entity28 west side , with its abandoned buildings , deserted homes and empty parks			2
since april , when gov. @entity46 signed @entity47 to punish illegal immigrants for the sins of the employers who hire them , estimates are that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have left @entity1 for a warmer climate in @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 or @entity58			1
last week , @entity5 district judge @entity59 struck down four of the most grotesque and illogical parts of the law , including the requirement that local police attempt to determine the immigration status of individuals they suspect of being in the country illegally and language making it a crime to solicit work			1
i have been watching this drama play out from @entity73			2
but as someone who lived in @entity1 about 10 years ago , i needed a closer look to see what life is like in this desert metropolis now that the law has taken effect -- or rather , what 's left of it			1
i 'm a @entity5 citizen ; my parents and three of my four grandparents were born in the @entity5			2
when i lived here a decade ago , i was struck by how comfortable @entity85 and whites seemed with one another			1
there was the occasional conflict , but more often there was compromise and cooperation , even on the issue of immigration			1
today a heated debate has produced hard feelings			2
the everyday interactions between @entity85 and whites are much more frayed than when i was covering @entity0 as a reporter for the @entity100			1
seventy percent of whites , according to polls , support @entity47 but 70 percent of @entity85 oppose it			1
until the judge 's decision , there were many whites who were happy the state was taking action against illegal immigration ; now they 're unhappy with the judge 's ruling , meaning almost every group in the state is up in arms for one reason or another			1
i ask the hot dog vendor how " @entity118 " -- her landlord , the people at the supermarket , etc. -- are treating her			2
" everyone is different , " she says			2
others look at you funny , like you 're not welcomed			2
" i think about my question			2
unwittingly , i had invited her to engage in the same kind of racial profiling that most opponents of @entity47 deplore			0
she prefers instead to judge people as individuals and not generalize based on stereotypes			1
i wonder if this woman is available to give seminars to @entity1 law enforcement officers who might soon find themselves in need of that skill set			1
later , i interviewed a married couple who came to the @entity5 legally but lapsed into illegal status when their visa expired			1
they should have gone back to @entity58 , but they 'd already put down roots in @entity0 , where the husband could earn at least 10 times what he could make in @entity58			0
we talked about how some conservatives insist that illegal immigrants take jobs from @entity5 workers			1
" that 's not true , " says the husband , who 's worked his way up from manual labor to an office job for a jeweler			0
they do n't want to work			0
" but then , he catches himself -- and corrects himself			0
" i should n't say that , " he says			0
" they 're not all like that , but some are			0
they think it 's easy to come to the @entity5 legally , and they speak from ignorance			0
" it 's interesting that even in a state that recently made it legal for police officers to make assumptions and jump to conclusions about who is or is n't an illegal immigrant , there are illegal immigrants who are fair - minded enough not to make assumptions and jump to conclusions about the rest of us			1
no matter what @entity185 decided , the hot dog vendor is still worried			0
she thinks a lot of @entity0 police officers and county sheriff deputies , under the command of cartoonish @entity193 sheriff @entity192 , have been champing at the bit for a law like this to give them an excuse to hassle people with brown skin			1
people like that , she says , wo n't let the judge 's ruling get in the way of enforcing a law which they support			1
since the law took effect , @entity192 's deputies have raided residences thought to be " drop houses , " where illegal immigrant smugglers harbor their human cargo			1
no wonder immigrants are afraid			1
those who have n't left the state are living as shut - ins			1
they go outside when they have to go to work			0
otherwise , they stay behind closed doors			0
there is another kind of racism at play here			0
you 've heard how @entity1 tried to empower local police to arrest gardeners and housekeepers to crack down on @entity22 drug dealers			1
that 's just how the state 's anti-immigrant efforts are packaged for public consumption			0
the @entity22 drug dealer is the @entity235 of the immigration debate			1
what are nativists supposed to do ? convince @entity240 that the nannies they give their babies to every day are dangerous , that the gardeners to whom they volunteer their security code are a threat			0
you need drug dealers in this dialogue			0
who else are people going to be afraid of ? not a hot dog vendor			0
think about where that woman was from -- @entity23			0
that state is the capital of the @entity22 drug trafficking industry			0
if you 're from @entity23 and you sell drugs , you can live a luxurious life in @entity58			0
if you sell hot dogs , you work long , hot nights in the desert			0
@entity240 are ginning up fear of one to rid their state of the other			0
i finish my second hot dog -- the best i 've tasted this side of @entity270 -- and pay the bill			0
oh , by the way , i ask the woman : " what 's your name ? " she smiles , looks away and shakes her head			0
she wo n't tell me			0
she must figure , why take chances ? for immigrants , there 's enough of that going on already in this city , where just getting in a car or walking down the street can be a high - stakes gamble			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity287			1

new immigration law adds to tension in @entity1 , says @entity287
illegal immigrants on edge even though judge *blocked* worse parts of law , he says
@entity287 : some have left @entity1 in search of a better climate in other states
law is polarizing ; whites support it *strongly* and @entity85 opposing it , @entity287 says
