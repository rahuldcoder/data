-- @entity1 is not in danger of losing his job , but that does n't mean he can brush off recent criticism of his leadership			1
@entity7 has had a rough first three months as a public company			2
the social network 's stock has performed poorly since going public in may , and on monday morning it dropped to an all - time low of $ 18.75 -- less than half of the company 's initial share price of $ 38			1
investors are looking to place blame for the disappointing performance , and the obvious target is @entity1 , the company 's founder and chief executive			1
the 28 - year - old casual - wear enthusiast built @entity7 from a dorm - room project into a publicly traded company with 900 million monthly users that saw $ 3.7 billion in revenue and $ 1 billion in profits last year			1
but since the stock slumped again this week , some critics have openly questioned whether @entity7 's boy - wonder ceo has the maturity necessary to navigate the corporate world			1
in a much - repeated quote that reflected the divide between buttoned - down @entity35 and laid - back startup culture , one analyst wondered if @entity1 " is in over his hoodie			1
" " he is a brilliant guy			0
he is the visionary behind this company			0
but ... what he is not is ceo material , " @entity41 columnist @entity40 told @entity0 this week			2
now @entity1 is tasked with rebuilding confidence among investors and employees			1
and some analysts said they think he should start by speaking up about what , exactly , @entity7 is up to			2
" it 's his responsibility ; it is his obligation to deal with investors , " said @entity49 , an analyst with @entity50			0
" i 'm not sure he cares enough , and i think the management is going to do what the ceo tells them to do			0
" the shift from coder to investor - relations manager might not come naturally to @entity1 , who has repeatedly emphasized that @entity7 was not started as a company , and its goal is to focus on the product before profit			1
" we do n't build services to make money ; we make money to build better services , " he said in a letter to investors before going public			0
but since its initial public offering , the company has been slow to introduce major new products			0
one cause of the company 's stock troubles , according to @entity49 , is that it changed its strategy between its ipo and the first earnings call , significantly increasing operating costs			0
the vast majority of @entity7 's revenue comes from advertising , but the company has n't explained in detail what it 's spending its new revenue on , and how or when those investments will translate into increased profits			2
a lack of transparency can create uncertainty , which causes people who own the stock to sell and people who are inclined to buy the stock to wait until they have more information , @entity49 said			0
" investors do n't know how to think about @entity7 , most likely because they do n't use it , " said @entity94 , an analyst at @entity95 , who speculates that typical investors are more likely to be on @entity97			1
he agrees that more communication from @entity1 is needed to give investors faith			1
even shareholders who fully understand @entity7 's business model are jumping ship			2
the company 's morale was dealt a huge blow this week when venture capitalist @entity108 , a board member and early @entity7 investor , unloaded the majority of his shares , bringing the amount of money he 's made off the company to more than $ 1 billion			1
loss of confidence by shareholders exacerbates @entity35 's other major concern -- that @entity7 issued too many shares to begin with			1
@entity7 's lockup periods -- rules that prevent early investors and employees from selling stock for a set amount of time following an ipo -- are starting to expire , allowing people such as @entity108 to sell			1
" the lockups are expiring too soon ; the market is just not prepared to absorb this many shares , " @entity49 said			0
facebook employees are n't able to sell their stocks just yet , but if @entity1 ca n't instill confidence in @entity7 soon , they could add to the problem by selling off their shares as soon as it 's allowed later this year			1
for now , they are powerless to do anything but watch while the value of their stock tumbles			0
sagging morale can have a negative impact on every aspect of running a business , including employee recruiting and retention			0
according to @entity146 , @entity1 addressed employees ' concerns in a meeting in august , saying he understands it may be " painful " for them to watch the value of the stock drop			1
" he focuses on shipping and user experience			0
he gives his employees a mission to believe in , " said @entity156 , who favorably compares @entity1 's strategy to that of @entity159 , another tech - company founder who focused on products above investors			1
that leadership approach turned out pretty well for @entity166			0
but @entity1 is not leading the company on his own			2
he has surrounded himself with experienced @entity169 and business veterans , including chief operating officer @entity171 , who previously worked at @entity172 and for the @entity173			0
publicly , @entity1 is keeping his head down while @entity7 works to address other issues , such as its challenges making money on mobile users			1
on thursday , the company rolled out updates to its mobile @entity182 and @entity183 apps , which are significantly speedier than the previous versions			0
also , the company 's purchase of @entity187 was approved by the @entity188 this week , which will allow @entity7 to focus even more on mobile products			2
despite some speculation in the media about whether he might step down , @entity1 's job is safe			0
he has job security primarily because he smartly owns 20.7 % of @entity7 's stock and has a 57 % voting stake in the company			2
many investors also recognize how integral his image and leadership are to the @entity7 brand , and they are still willing to give him a chance			2
" he has not proven his lack of ability and he has not yet proven his ability , " @entity49 said			0
" so let 's give him a few more quarters and see what he does			0

@entity7 stock hit a record low of $ 18.75 this week
