-- while anxiously awaiting the september 30 season premiere of " homeland , " you likely have a lot of remaining questions about season one : will @entity7 remember that @entity8 knew @entity9 ? what happened to the @entity8 confession video ? why would someone eat peanut butter off a ruler ? and of course : did @entity16 keep her hair short , the way @entity8 apparently " always liked it ? " @entity20 , who plays military wife and mother @entity22 on the @entity25 - nominated @entity24 hit , is featured in the october issue of @entity27			1
in the piece , writer @entity28 calls @entity20 " the most beautiful woman in the world " ( six times ) , but notes that the actress ' hair " appears to be in transition , caught somewhere between @entity31 and @entity32			0
" what happened to the pixie cut she featured in her brief but epic run on the more recent resurrection of " v ? " @entity28 asks			0
@entity20 , 33 , explained to " @entity27 " that after having had " superlong " hair " forever , " she took on a role that called for short hair and for years afterward volleyed between cutting it and wearing wigs			2
for the past four years , however , she 's kept her locks super short -- in the pre-haircut " homeland " episodes she 's actually wearing a wig			1
now , @entity20 said , she 's " growing it out for ' @entity51 '			0
" how we first got to know @entity20 ... with entire online message boards devoted to @entity20 's hair , the consensus is this : the public is largely taken aback when a gorgeous woman sports a short haircut			1
in the december 2011 issue of @entity64 , actress @entity61 , who 's worn a pixie - style cut for years , admitted " straight men across the board are not into this hair ! i cut it for the one straight man who has ever liked short hair and i wear it in memorial of somebody who really loved it			2
" @entity61 ' cropped tresses are a tribute to the late actor @entity76 , with whom she has a daughter , @entity77			1
incidentally , @entity61 said that 6 - year - old @entity77 would love to see her mom with long hair			0
@entity81 's hair is currently in a pixie style , too , but she had to cut it in order to play @entity85 , the terminally - ill prostitute who sells her hair in " @entity87			2
" @entity81 told @entity88 on " live ! " that the cut left her " inconsolable , " reducing her to " mental patient - level crying			0
" what we know about @entity51 's @entity93 there are , of course , many beautiful actresses other than @entity20 , @entity61 and @entity81 who have successfully , if briefly , worn their hair short : @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 come to mind			2
that 's not to say that there has n't been a fair share of short hair backlash either			0
remember when " @entity112 " cut her hair short in season two of the eponymous college drama ? if not , maybe you saw the ratings - fallout incident mentioned on " @entity115 , " " @entity116 , " " @entity118 " or " @entity117			0
" with @entity20 's @entity22 transitioning into the political wife role , it 'll be interesting to see viewer reaction to her hairstyle			1
what about you ? how do you prefer @entity20 / @entity22 's hair ?			1
