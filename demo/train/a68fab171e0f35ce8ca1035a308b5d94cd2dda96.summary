-- @entity1 is having his worst season on the tennis tour since he became a grand slam champion			1
he suffered his earliest grand slam exit in a decade and has slipped to seventh in the world rankings			1
for the first time since 2002 , he did n't reach a grand slam final			0
his coach , @entity9 , appears to have paid the price for the slump as @entity1 announced saturday that he had cut ties with the @entity13 who used to work with 14 - time major winner @entity15 and ex @entity17 no. 1 @entity16			1
@entity19 's ties to @entity15 and @entity16 contributed to @entity1 hiring him in the first place , since the 17 - time grand slam winner is friends with both former players			1
" when we started together we had a vision of a 3 year plan to win another grand slam title and get back to the number # 1 ranking , " @entity1 wrote on his website			1
" along with many other goals and great memories , these 2 main goals were achieved			0
" after numerous conversations culminating at the end of our most recent training block , we felt like this was the best time and path for both of us			0
" @entity9 remains a dear friend , and we both look forward to continuing our friendship			2
i want to thank @entity9 for his help and the value he has added to me and my team			2
" it 's likely that @entity1 will continue to work with @entity50 @entity49 captain @entity48 , who often accompanies him to tournaments , as he tries to earn a spot at the year - end championships in @entity54			1
@entity1 is by no means guaranteed a berth in the eight - man field and his chances were n't helped when he lost to @entity59 in the third round of this week 's @entity61			2
afterwards , @entity59 said @entity1 's aura was fading			0
" i think he ( misses ) a little bit more than he used to , '' he said			0
'' i know he will try and go for his shot , but maybe he is a bit less confident			0
'' @entity1 said on the eve of the tournament he was looking forward to a " great " 2014 and his decision to split with @entity19 suggests he is indeed determined to win another major rather than simply linger in the top 10			2
his next event is at home in @entity74 , @entity50 in a little over a week .			0

@entity1 announces that he has cut ties with @entity13 coach @entity9
