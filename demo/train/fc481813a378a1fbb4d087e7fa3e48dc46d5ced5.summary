-- aviation is n't known as the most eco-friendly industry			2
carbon emissions aside , running an airline produces an incredible amount of waste			2
everything from uneaten food to outdated uniforms is potential landfill fodder			2
@entity11 , for one , has decided to do something about it			1
after a large - scale redesign of many of its 737 aircraft , the carrier found itself with an excess of 80,000 leather seat covers -- enough to fill the @entity20			1
" we had this idea of ' could we do something with this leather beyond recycling it or shredding it ? could we repurpose it ? ' " says @entity27 , the airline 's senior manager of culture and communications			1
@entity11 dubbed the initiative " @entity32 : repurpose with @entity34 , " and reached out to potential partners to take the used leather , but found that there were few takers			1
" it 's awesome to have a great idea , but you have to have support for those -- quote - unquote -- great ideas			2
i worked with our green team for nine months to find a use for the leather			1
it 's actually much harder than you think it would be , " says @entity27			2
following the advice of @entity55 , a @entity11 vp who grew up in @entity56 , the airline started looking towards @entity57 for recipients of the used leather			1
rather than just donating the goods and leaving it there , the airline decided to take a more holistic approach , giving the materials to ngos that will use them to provide job training and health education			1
the main partner is @entity56 , which is providing paid apprenticeships and training to orphaned youth , who in turn make shoes and soccer balls from the leather			1
the shoes are given to @entity76 , who distributes them as part of a campaign to fight debilitating foot parasites			2
the soccer balls are donated to @entity82 , a charity that uses sport to educate young people on @entity85 and malaria prevention			0
" it 's really easy to donate and walk away			0
we did n't want to do that			0
the leather is finite , but the skills these young people will learn will hopefully take them through their lives , " says @entity27			1
the redesign was itself an environmental measure			0
the seats were reupholstered with @entity97 , a substance created from scraps the leather industry discards			1
the material is also lighter , reducing the weight of each aircraft by 600 pounds , and saving on fuel			0
no incentive @entity106 , the founder of upcycling company @entity110 and @entity11 's only @entity109 partner , says the reason companies are resistant to using second - hand materials is that there 's no financial imperative			1
" it is unfortunately cheaper and easier for most companies to take materials they 've used or have purchased at some point in time and just throw them away			0
just landfill or incinerate then , " he says			0
there is , however , an ecological incentive			0
according to @entity106 , who will create special - edition bags from the leather , each bag uses 4,000 gallons less water than if created using virgin leather			1
he also puts the @entity131 reduction at 82 %			0
" the circular economy starts to work when the value of the carbon emissions and water starts coming into play , like in the @entity137 , where they will soon start having tax benefits for low - carbon companies , " he says			0
an upcycling uptick ? though @entity143 is perhaps the largest airline - led upcycling initiative , it is not the first of its kind			0
when @entity150 redesigned cabin crew uniforms in 2011 , the carrier had the surplus fabric woven into the carpets that lined the business class cabin in the then - new 747 - 400 fleet			1
@entity156 last year had old uniforms recycled into car insulation , and in the past has repurposed plastic meal trays to create cutlery , and used the cables from seat backs to make headphones			1
" when we launch a new product , we always ask , ' what is the life cycle of this product and what will we do with it at the end of its life ? ' " says @entity165 , @entity156 's vice president of sustainable development			0
it 's a trend that 's only likely to grow			0
" this is a new area for us , and with the leather , we 're just dipping our toe in the water , " explains @entity27			2
" our ceo has asked , ' what else can we upcycle ? ' so i 'm hoping we 'll see upcycling for years to come			0
" report : airline recycling in ' sorry state '			0

@entity11 is repurposing 80,000 used leather seat covers
the carrier has teamed with @entity57 ngos to reuse the leather
the leather will be used in job training and various health education initiatives
