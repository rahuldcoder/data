@entity1 , @entity0 -- when it comes to @entity7 - compliant banking , few @entity4 countries can compete with @entity8			1
one of the world 's prime financial centers , the @entity11 is also the key @entity4 hub for @entity14 banking			1
the @entity15 opened its doors in 2004 and became the @entity8 's first and only standalone @entity14 high street bank			2
with 23 banks , nine fund managers and a number of international law firms offering @entity14 finance in the @entity11 , by 2006 @entity8 sharia - compliant assets were thought to be in the region of $ 22 billion			1
the global industry has trebled in the past decade and is now worth around $ 531 billion			0
@entity8 is also in the vanguard when it comes to @entity7 - compliant retail banking , catering for its population of approximately three million @entity30			1
in 2004 , the @entity31 ( @entity15 ) opened its doors for the first time , becoming the @entity8 's first and only standalone @entity14 high street bank			2
a number of @entity8 's " big five " high street banks are getting in on the act			0
@entity37 and @entity38 offer @entity14 banking , including mortgages , current accounts and trust funds for children			1
in the retail market , @entity8 is the only @entity45 country that offers government - authorized islamic banking products			2
in the @entity51 , only regional banks like @entity49 , @entity50 offer @entity7 - compliant products			1
authorities and regulators in @entity55 -- despite having a @entity30 population twice the size of @entity8 's at six million -- have been slow to realize the potential of this sector			0
" in @entity55 , @entity14 finance is at an embryonic stage			0
they are where we were three or four years ago , " @entity62 , the @entity15 's director of sales told the @entity63			0
@entity8 mosques dating back 150 years attest to the long connection between the @entity8 and @entity30 , but it is the @entity8 government 's staunch support of the sector -- backing words with legislative changes -- that has responded to the needs of @entity30 in the financial world			0
@entity76 , who was involved with the setup of the @entity15 , told @entity2 : " government is a firm supporter of the industry down to amending legislation to create a level playing field for @entity14 banking			2
" the @entity8 sector is currently experiencing phenomenal growth of around 20 percent per year compared with global growth of around 15 percent			0
industry insiders feel there is still scope for continued growth			0
@entity91 of @entity37 @entity14 finance told @entity2 : " @entity14 finance is still in its infancy at the moment			2
we 're seeing a fantastic rate of growth both globally and here in the @entity8			0
" @entity37 now offers @entity7 - compliant banking at all of its 2,000 @entity8 branches			1
services include an @entity14 current account , mortgage and child trust fund			0
@entity14 mortgages have proved particularly successful in @entity8 , with the market growing from barely a trickle in 2003 to a value of $ 1.7 billion in 2007			2
but @entity14 banking in the @entity51 is suffering from an image problem			1
many @entity51 are felt to be hostile to the concept after the 9/11 attacks , equating it with " terrorist finance			0
" " there seems to be this misperception out there that the @entity51 is perhaps islamophobic , " said @entity115 , an attorney at law firm @entity116 and @entity118 , which has had a practice dedicated to @entity14 banking and finance since the 1980s			1
" the @entity51 regulators have been supportive and they 've accommodated @entity14 banking and finance since the mid 80s , " @entity115 told @entity2			1
with a best - guess figure of six million @entity30 in the @entity51 of whom around 60 percent are devout ( and therefore likely to use islamic banking services ) , @entity115 considers domestic @entity7 - compliant banking an untapped market			1
" we have at least 3.6 million [ potential customers ] at the very base level market opportunity for banks from abroad and here to tap into , " he explained			0
even so , with constitutional limits on promoting any one religion over another , which keeps legislators quiet about the opportunities , and no sign that any major @entity51 banks will be rolling out @entity14 products , the market remains unexploited for now			1

@entity8 leads the *western* world in terms of @entity7 - compliant banking
major banks such as @entity38 and @entity37 offer @entity14 banking
in the @entity51 only regional banks like offer @entity7 - compliant products
