@entity0 -- inside a tall , red - brick building in @entity4 , @entity5 , there is a federal courtroom just waiting for admitted intelligence leaker @entity7 to show up			1
but if he ever gets there , and it may be a while , the record of trials in the @entity10 suggests justice could be swift and certain			0
the modern , high - security facility just south of the nation 's capital was the original home of what has come to be known as " the rocket docket " -- a place where many cases proceed at lightning speed relative to legal proceedings elsewhere			1
high profile national security cases are tried there			1
it also is where the government 's criminal complaint against @entity7 alleging violations of the @entity30 was filed			1
there has been no indictment yet			0
while @entity7 's case is unusual and entangled in secrets that it could drag out for years , the @entity34 undeniably is one of the places that puts a premium on the concept of a " speedy trial			1
" that 's why a guy in @entity7 's position -- now a world away in @entity47 with a grant of temporary asylum -- has to think about his next move			1
so what 's an @entity53 leaker to do ? opinion : former spy : @entity56 gains with @entity7 in @entity47 while it is not always wise to speak with certainty about matters of international intrigue , here are five possible moves @entity7 could make			1
option 1 : find a way to get to a place of relative " long term " refuge			0
in a major victory , @entity7 won temporary political asylum in @entity47			1
" it 's a very significant achievement for @entity7			1
it gives him an entire year for him to figure out his options , to see if he can manage to get to one of the countries that has offered him asylum in @entity75			2
it takes him out of the discomfort of the transit zone and into @entity47 itself , where he presumably has to be with friends and associates and it just gives him a tremendous amount of time , " said international extradition lawyer @entity76			2
the down side for @entity7 is that his asylum is limited			2
" it creates the possibility that there has to be something new that will come up in a year , " said @entity1 consultant and former @entity89 official @entity87			0
option 2 : negotiate a solution and return to the @entity56			2
@entity7 's father , @entity95 , hoped at first that there might be a way to arrange for his son to return to the @entity56			1
but as of last week , he had changed his opinion dramatically after hearing commentary on the issue from @entity103 and the @entity105 administration			0
" in this climate , i do n't believe that 's possible			0
so yes , i think @entity47 is the best place for him			2
@entity47 has the strength and conviction to protect my son			2
" but experts do n't think the @entity114 is itching to strike a deal that would clear the way for @entity7 's return			1
" the @entity56 will not negotiate with fugitives as a matter of policy , " @entity76 said			0
it 's the least of @entity7 's worries now			1
the @entity56 has no extradition treaty with @entity47			1
why ? because certain senators fought it out of fear @entity47 might ask the @entity56 to hand over @entity47 dissidents and other defectors			1
the chances of the @entity56 quickly ratifying an extradition treaty are unlikely			2
option 4 : the " no passport " play			0
this could be a problem for @entity7			0
when he was indicted , the @entity133 also revoked his passport			0
according to @entity87 , international agreements allow governments to deport people without valid passports to the country from which they entered or to the nation of their citizenship			0
" so in this case , the @entity47 could at any time -- they could have done it already , they could do it now -- they could stick him back on a nonstop flight to @entity56 and say goodbye ... or to @entity146 where @entity7 was last			1
" @entity146 has an extradition agreement with the @entity56			2
option 5 : @entity151 to a nation 's embassy that will keep him			0
experts say it is always a possibility to camp at a foreign embassy in @entity156 or elsewhere			0
@entity158 founder @entity157 is inside the @entity159 in @entity160			0
and @entity7 is traveling with a representative of @entity158			0
" once he is in an embassy , in the sovereignty of another country there is nothing the @entity56 could do , " @entity76 said			0
opinion : how @entity169 's move could help @entity7 and @entity56 what is not likely , we are told , is a scenario involving @entity56 operatives grabbing @entity7 off the streets of @entity156 and delivering him to the @entity34 courtroom			1
that , say experts , only happens in @entity177 .			0

granted temporary asylum , @entity7 has few options while in @entity47
the federal court in @entity4 , @entity5 , *specializes* in the highest - level national security cases
@entity7 could be part of a negotiated deal to send him back to the @entity56
however , extradition is unlikely in the case of @entity7 , who 's *addmited* to leaking intel secrets
