-- a class of injectable drugs used to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis does n't raise the risk of serious infection when compared with more conventional treatments , according to a new analysis in the @entity9			2
the research , which was funded by the @entity11 and other federal health agencies , contradicts numerous earlier studies that did find an increased risk of infection associated with the drugs , known as tumor necrosis factor ( @entity18 ) inhibitors			1
the possibility that @entity18 inhibitors -- which include popular drugs such as @entity23 and @entity24 -- pose no additional infection risk is a " very new and heretical idea , " says @entity27 , @entity28 , a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the @entity31 , who cowrote an editorial accompanying the study			1
" @entity35 until now there has been considerable evidence that anti-tnfs heightened the risk of serious infection compared to other treatments			2
" @entity0 : signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis the lead author of the study , @entity42 , @entity28 , a professor of preventive medicine at @entity44 , in @entity45 , @entity46 , says the findings " should be reassuring for patients and providers			0
" @entity27 , however , says the new findings are n't sufficient to quell the concerns raised by previous studies			1
" we still need to be concerned about serious infection risk among patients starting these medicines , " he says			0
autoimmune conditions , including rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , and inflammatory bowel disease , arise when the body 's immune system goes awry and begins attacking healthy cells and tissue			0
@entity18 inhibitors -- known as biologic drugs , because they 're derived from substances that occur naturally in humans and animals -- work by blocking the action of @entity18 , an important immune - system molecule			1
@entity0 : 10 risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease this class of drugs drastically improved the treatment of these conditions when first introduced in the late 1990s , but because they suppress the immune system they are believed to open the door to opportunistic infections			0
some patients taking the drugs have died from these infections , and the @entity11 has been closely watching the drugs ' safety profile as more and more people use them			0
previous studies have found that @entity18 inhibitors as much as double the risk of serious infection compared with other treatment options			1
those trials tended to be relatively small , however			0
the new study , which was presented this weekend at an annual meeting of the @entity100 , sought to address that weakness			0
@entity42 and his colleagues combined data on more than 32,000 mostly low - income people from four large health - care databases , including those for @entity107 and @entity108			0
about half of the people took tnf - inhibitors for their conditions , and the other half took older , non-biologic drugs -- such as leflunomide , hydroxychloroquine , and sulfasalazine			0
@entity0 : got psoriasis ? 7 signs you may have arthritis too the authors identified 1,172 infections requiring hospitalization during the study period			0
( the most common infections were pneumonia and skin and soft - tissue infections			0
) after one year of treatment , people taking @entity18 inhibitors had no higher risk of serious infections than those taking other types of drugs			1
the researchers did find , however , that among patients with rheumatoid arthritis , the @entity18 inhibitor @entity140 carried an approximately 25 % higher risk of infection than @entity24 or @entity23			2
how well are you managing your rheumatoid arthritis ? take a health test it 's not clear why @entity140 might be riskier than other @entity18 inhibitors , but it 's possible that the higher initial doses the drug requires might be partly responsible , @entity42 says			1
the mechanism of action may also be slightly different than that of other @entity18 inhibitors , he adds			1
the study does have an important limitation that detracts from the findings , @entity27 says			2
as he notes in his editorial , some 40 % of participants taking @entity18 inhibitors dropped out within the first month , compared with only 15 % in the comparison group			1
in previous trials and in clinical practice , people who stop taking @entity18 blockers " tend to be older and at a higher risk of serious infections , " @entity27 says			1
that pattern , he adds , may have skewed the study results and made @entity18 inhibitors look safer than they perhaps really are			2

the research contradicts numerous earlier studies that did find an increased risk
@entity27 , however , says the new findings are n't sufficient to quell the concerns
previous studies have found that @entity18 inhibitors as much as double the risk
