-- @entity1 says results will be available monday from its referendum on changes to the country 's constitution , a vote taken as government troops continued pounding the opposition stronghold of @entity10 and other cities			1
opposition activists reported at least 55 deaths across the country on sunday , including 25 in @entity10 , which has been under bombardment for more than three weeks			1
despite the ongoing violence , it held a vote on what the government of president @entity20 calls a move toward reform			2
interior minister @entity26 said the voting ran " normally " in most provinces , and turnout was " huge ... except in some areas , " the state - run @entity24 reported			0
results from the vote would be announced monday evening , @entity24 said			0
but analysts and protesters ridicule the constitutional referendum as window dressing , the latest in a series of superficial measures intended to pacify @entity20 's critics			1
lt. col. @entity40 , a spokesman for the rebel @entity41 , said civilians reported government authorities were pressuring them to support the new constitution			0
@entity46 's family has ruled @entity1 for four decades			1
@entity47 , a @entity1 expert at the @entity48 , said the president is using the referendum " to get people to leave the streets " after a nearly year - long uprising			1
the @entity54 , a network of opposition activists , has said about 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown on opposition last march			1
the @entity62 government says more than 2,000 members of its security forces have been killed by " terrorists " during that period , including seven " martyrs " who were buried sunday , @entity24 reported			1
@entity0 and other media outlets can not independently verify opposition or government reports because @entity1 has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists			1
but the vast majority of reports from the ground indicate government forces are massacring citizens in an attempt to wipe out dissidents seeking @entity20 's ouster			1
in @entity10 , the @entity84 has been trying for days to negotiate even a temporary cease - fire to deliver humanitarian aid into the @entity10 and its hardest - hit neighborhood , @entity10 , without success			0
" the negotiations continue -- they never stop			0
we remain very hopeful to get back into @entity10 , but the negotiations have been difficult , " said @entity90 , a spokesman for the local partner organization , the @entity91			0
sunday 's toll also included nine deaths in @entity95 , seven in @entity96 and 11 in @entity97 , where @entity62 tanks began shelling the city early sunday , according to the @entity54			1
@entity1 announced the referendum amid intense international pressure to halt the bloodshed and open up its regime to reforms			2
but among the changes in sunday 's referendum was one article that states " the law shall regulate the provisions and procedures related to the formation of political parties			2
" " carrying out any political activity or forming any political parties or groupings on the basis of religious , sectarian , tribal , regional , class - based , professional , or on discrimination based on gender , origin , race or color may not be undertaken , " it continues			0
the language suggests government permission is needed to form a party and excludes a number of people and groups from political activity , @entity47 said			2
" it 's not going to change the fact that it 's a minority - dominated situation , " he said			0
" it will remain a presidential system with powers vested in the hands of the president			0
" but former @entity62 lawmaker @entity137 said " clause 8 of the new draft of the constitution is the essential point " of the document			2
it " allows a multi-party system " instead of leaving the ruling @entity144 as " the leading party of the society and the state , " as current constitution does			0
@entity137 said " special committees will be formed to look into the licensing of new parties in line with the new constitution			0
" as for presidential elections , they " will be competitive since there is no leading party anymore , and all the parties ' candidates are eligible provided their candidacy is endorsed by at least 35 members of parliament , " @entity137 said			0
meanwhile , the opposition @entity164 urged @entity1 's @entity166 community , the minority sect to which @entity20 belongs , to join the revolt and promised their rights would be protected in a @entity1			1
" the @entity166 remain an important component of @entity1 , and will continue to enjoy the same rights as other citizens as we build one nation of @entity176 , @entity177 , and other sects , " an @entity164 statement declared			1
" the regime will not be successful in pitting us against one another			0
we are determined to unite our society , and the first step is for us to extend our hand to our @entity166 brothers and sisters , to build in @entity1 a nation governed by citizenship and the rule of law			1
" the opposition council acknowledged that the revolt had been tinged with " sectarian strife " -- but it blamed that on @entity20 's " brutal violence , which has led to an increase in sectarianism			1
" " however , it is important to emphasize that the first step in halting sectarian strife in @entity1 is to overthrow the regime , " it said			2
" we in the @entity164 consider members of the @entity166 sect to be an essential element of @entity1 's cultural and ethnic fabric			1
" and @entity207 secretary of state @entity206 said sunday that diplomatic efforts were under way to peel away support from @entity1 's president @entity20			1
" we have a lot of contacts , as do other countries -- a lot of sources within the @entity62 government and the business community and minority communities -- and our message is the same to all of them : ' you can not continue to support this illegitimate regime because it is going to fall , ' " @entity211 told @entity0			1
but she said the @entity164 was not yet the kind of united opposition movement that toppled @entity227 with international help in @entity229 last year			2
the @entity229 opposition base in the city of @entity232 gave the international community " an address " to deal with , @entity211 said			1
" we do n't have that in @entity1 , " she said			2
" the @entity164 is doing the best it can but obviously it is not yet a united opposition			0
" and former @entity207 national security adviser @entity239 also cautioned against seeing @entity1 as another @entity229			1
" we should n't be careless in any comparisons between @entity20 and @entity227			2
@entity227 was far more vulnerable than @entity20 is			2
i think it 's far from clear yet that @entity20 can , in fact , be overthrown at this stage , " @entity239 told @entity0 's " @entity244			2
" he recommended letting regional powers take the lead on whether to arm @entity1 's opposition			1
" i would be very much guided by the @entity248 and the @entity249			0
the @entity248 have the regional role to play			0
they 're assuming that role			0
they have intelligent leadership , " he said			0
" the choice of how to act and particularly if one is to be engaged in some fashion militarily , i think , has to be made first by them and also the @entity249 , and not first by us			0
" questioned about the brutality that the government has unleashed since demonstrations began nearly a year ago , @entity260 said that history shows brutality often works			0
@entity0 's @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .			0
