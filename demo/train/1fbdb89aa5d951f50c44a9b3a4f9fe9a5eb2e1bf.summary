@entity0 -- we 're approaching the 100th anniversary of the birthday of @entity5 : february 6 , 2011			1
it 's time to begin thinking seriously about an appropriate national commemoration of this good man and great president			1
to date , the main attempts to honor @entity5 in the nation 's capital have gone askew			1
a government office building second in size only to the @entity15 ? an airport from which @entity17 can not fly to @entity18 ? these do not seem very appropriate monuments to a president who fought bureaucracy and yearned for home			2
the other ideas that sometimes circulate in @entity25 seem equally misplaced : placing @entity5 on the currency or building a giant statue somewhere in @entity0			1
more than most presidents , @entity5 would have wanted to be remembered for his ideas , not his image			2
the right commemoration would honor those			0
let me suggest something : a museum in @entity0 dedicated to the victims of communism			1
the struggle against communism impelled @entity41 foreign policy for almost half a century			0
that struggle was also the central concern of @entity5 's political life			1
as much as @entity5 cared about the geopolitics of the struggle , he cared even more about the human victims of communism 's brutal totalitarian ideology			1
the countries of @entity49 are now memorializing their terrible experiences under communism			0
a particularly impressive museum has opened in @entity53 , @entity54			0
but @entity49 did not suffer alone			0
@entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 also have their stories to tell			0
a " @entity64 of the @entity65 " in @entity0 would ensure that these stories were kept alive and made vivid for future generations			2
the @entity66 in @entity0 offers an outstanding example to emulate			2
the @entity66 has emerged as one of @entity0 's most - visited sites			1
it offers a message that is purposeful as well as mournful			0
it 's a message propounded from the @entity73 to the @entity74 -- and a message to which @entity5 devoted his political life : the principles on which the @entity41 is built are not mere preferences			1
reject those principles , and you are embarking on a nightmare that can culminate in the ultimate horrors of human injustice , oppression , cruelty and violence			0
as yet , the crimes of communism are appallingly minimized , excused or even condoned in the places where they were ordered , places such as @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
earlier this year , i had the chance to visit the one and only public remembrance of the @entity98 in all @entity56 , a small museum in a park on the outskirts of a provincial city			0
what could be more fitting than to remember those crimes in the city that we called the capital of the free world during the struggle against communism ? and in the name of the president who not only spoke so eloquently against those crimes , but who issued the challenge that presaged communism 's downfall ? so there 's my proposal for the new @entity25			2
introduce a bill to authorize the development of the museum on february 6 , with a view to completing work in time for @entity5 's 110th birthday in 2021			1
instead of a statue , remember this president who so valued the individual with a monument that will restore the individuality of wronged , imprisoned and murdered millions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity132 .			2

the 100th anniversary of @entity5 's birth is february 6 , 2011
@entity132 says @entity0 has honored him *inappropriately* , with a building , an airport
he says the real monument to @entity5 would be a museum honoring victims of communism
@entity5 's great cause was to fight against communist regimes , @entity132 says
