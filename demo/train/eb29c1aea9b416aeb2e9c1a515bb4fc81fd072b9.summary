-- @entity1 is football 's newest favorite pop star			1
after attending her first college football game on october 4 ( @entity4 vs. @entity5 ) , appearing on @entity7 's " @entity6 " and sending a flirtatious message to @entity10 quarterback @entity9 , pretty much the only thing left for @entity12 to do is take the field herself			2
according to reports , @entity12 will come close to doing just that as the star of 2015 's @entity19 halftime show			1
@entity1 reportedly to perform at @entity21 halftime neither @entity12 nor the @entity22 has commented on the speculation , and the singer herself seemed to downplay the idea during her appearance on " @entity6			1
" " i 'm not the kind of girl who would pay to play the @entity19 , " @entity12 said , referring to an august @entity29 report suggesting that @entity12 , @entity30 and @entity31 were three of the acts in consideration for the opportunity but that the @entity22 was requesting they pay to take the stage			0
the @entity29 noted that the request was met with a " chilly " response , as indicated by @entity12 's comment last week			2
but by friday , it seems someone 's tune changed , with the @entity44 's @entity43 and @entity45 reporting that @entity12 is preparing to shine at @entity21 , set for february 1 in @entity46 , @entity47			1
it 's not hard to see why the @entity22 would want to pursue @entity12 ; if her much - talked - about performance happens , these are three reasons why we think she 'd kill it			1
she 's got energetic , exuberant pop. @entity1 's music is essentially the stuff @entity19 halftime dreams are made of			1
much of her catalog is high - energy , danceable pop that 's just cheeky enough to be entertaining without losing a sponsorship			2
and she has a backlog of hits to choose from : there 's " birthday " and " @entity70 " from her 2013 release " @entity68 , " plus older but still - in - rotation tracks like " firework , " " @entity74 , " " @entity75 " and " @entity71			0
everyone from your grandma to your 3 - year - old nephew knows her music			0
in 2011 , @entity1 tied with @entity81 -- not bad company -- with five no. 1 singles from the same album			2
you do n't accomplish that without some serious fan power , young and old			0
and when we say young , we mean young : " @entity89 " has been known to soothe at least one baby			0
she gives a show - stopping performance			0
one of the things critics took away from @entity12 's 2012 concert documentary , " @entity96 , " is that just much work goes into a @entity12 performance			0
from the costumes to the set pieces , @entity12 creates her own whimsical wonderland -- as anyone who 's seen one of her videos can attest			0
we can only imagine the kind of creation that would accompany a @entity19 halftime show .			1

@entity1 is reportedly performing at the @entity21 halftime show
she *initially* seemed to downplay the *rumors*
it 's not hard to imagine why she 'd be a great *selection* for the *program*
