-- the dreadful shooting sprees of the past few months , which claimed dozens of innocent lives , shocked and unnerved millions of @entity3			0
the specter of some heavily armed madman turning a theater , a temple , a mall or a school into his personal battle zone has become all too real and terrifying			0
the latest episode still unfolding in @entity13 implicates , oddly enough , a former @entity15 police officer , 33 - year - old @entity14 , who allegedly is seeking redress for perceived mistreatment by the @entity18			1
@entity14 was a member of the department for three years before losing his badge in 2008 , reportedly for lying about a fellow officer			2
when he was unable to win back his job , murder became , as a manifesto attributed to @entity14 put it , " a necessary evil " for him to prevail in the face of racism and injustice			1
@entity15 cops talked by suspect , and brutal past other than the alleged gunman 's former profession , this case is actually quite prototypical of the nearly two dozen massacres that occur each year in the @entity3			1
it is a story that my @entity38 colleague @entity37 and i have seen time and time again in our several decades of research on this extreme form of violence			0
by looking closely enough , one can usually make some sense of seemingly senseless behavior			0
the notion of a deranged gunman who suddenly snaps and goes berserk is more myth than reality			0
rather , mass murderers act methodically and with purpose			1
and unlike the shooting sprees in @entity54 , @entity55 and elsewhere , in which victims who were unknown to their assailants had the horrible misfortune to be in the worst place at the worst time , most mass murders involve people specifically targeted for specific reasons			1
@entity64 murderers tend to be middle - aged men who see themselves as victims of injustice			1
although bitter , resentful and full of despair , they see others , often the former boss or supervisor , as the people who are to blame for their miserable existence			0
indeed , the workplace is one of the more familiar venues for mass murder , going way back to the 1980s when " going postal " became part of our everyday vernacular			2
manhunt reminiscent of @entity81 sniper case typically , we see a former employee in public service or private industry who feels mistreated and wronged			2
believing that his firing is patently unjust , and with nothing left to lose , he decides sooner or later to become the powerful one who will do the " firing			0
" when he is deprived of his financial security , sense of purpose and dignity , the idea of getting even becomes all consuming			0
as i write this on @entity101 of the @entity15 area manhunt , the terror enveloping the region is combined with anxious uncertainty over when the threat will finally be over and , more critically , whether the victim count will rise before the alleged assailant is found dead or alive			2
already five people have been shot -- the daughter of the union representative who participated in @entity14 's unsuccessful grievance hearing and her fiance were fatally wounded , as was one of three police officers gunned down in the continuing rampage			1
these five victims are actually surrogates , in what is known as " murder by proxy			2
" even when the primary targets are not readily available , others may be viewed as guiltyâ € ” and may be assaulted -- simply because of their association			2
meanwhile , dozens more among the alleged gunman 's hit list of enemies remain on edge and in hiding until it is safe to resurface			0
not surprisingly , one of the more prominent features to the usual mass - murder profile is access to a powerful enough weapon to achieve an expansive deadly plan			1
particularly frightening in the ongoing @entity15 drama , of course , is the marksmanship skills that @entity14 undoubtedly acquired through his careers with the @entity137 and in law enforcement , giving added significance to the phrase , " armed and dangerous			1
" alleged cop - killer 's manifesto details threats adding insult to injury , the man at the center of attention is likely thrilled			1
if he is like most mass murderers , it is not the spotlight that he is enjoying , but the satisfaction of payback			1
others have been made to suffer , as he has in the past			0
the big question is how many more will be harmed in his methodical and deliberate quest for revenge			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162			0

@entity164 : @entity15 rampage case is typical of mass murders ; like most , planned , methodical
he says mass murderers tend to be *aggrieved* middle - aged men , aiming to regain ' power '
he says in @entity14 case , some killed were not actual targets , but cases of ' murder by proxy '
@entity180 : @entity181 usually thrilled at attention , satisfaction of ' payback '
