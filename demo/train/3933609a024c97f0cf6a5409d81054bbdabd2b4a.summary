-- i am a movie critic			2
but because i am not employed by a newspaper , or a television station , web magazine , ad agency or any institution that contributes to or profits from the media carnival that has become the @entity9 , i can admit without fear of repercussion that the @entity9 leave me colder than an arctic vortex			1
if there were some remote planet or sun - kissed island where i could flee the din , i would go there			2
but i bet even remote outposts , windswept @entity23 tundra or ships lost at sea , places without water or central heating , have a pipeline to the @entity9 countdown			1
like @entity28 and the presidential campaign , the @entity9 race -- a misnomer , suggesting speed -- goes on too damn long			1
this is true even in a year when the nominees are more exciting than usual , perhaps even justifying the oft - made claim that the @entity9 has become younger and less stodgy			1
" @entity41 " is a comedy ; " her " a delicate love story between a man and a computer program ; " @entity42 " raucous and controversial , " @entity43 " bleak			0
( of course , we have been shocked before			0
" ) the @entity9 has never been a barometer of quality , in fact it has a fairly dismal record when it comes to truly great or slightly difficult films			1
it 's tended to favor the inspirational over the fatalistic ; high - minded drama over comedy and noir ; @entity55 over @entity56 ( " @entity57 " vs. " @entity58 " )			0
when @entity62 , the channel to which i am devoted above all others , programs a whole month of @entity9 winners i lose interest			1
other media outlets are not so restrained			0
the @entity68 , like other organs of record no doubt , begins early -- sometime in summer -- with possibilities and probabilities , profiles and features leading up to and exploiting the fall 's releases , until it 's virtually blanket coverage			1
brains that should be doing better things are busy handicapping and making lists			0
like the presidential primaries ( remember when @entity82 was a sure winner ? ) , the forecasts are wrong as often as not , but nobody 's ever held accountable			0
now that the @entity85 have become the rehearsal dinner to the @entity9 ceremony and fashion gets more coverage than international and domestic news combined , we watch as an armada of reporters is deployed to relay the buzz , and stories spill over into every section except sports			1
but more important is what this carefully staged mass hysteria and nonstop coverage does to the movies and the stars			1
films that open early in the year are virtually shut out by the bottom - heavy pattern of release and ruckus surrounding the end - of - year " prestige " films			1
gems like " before midnight , " " @entity109 , " and " @entity110 " might as well have opened seven years ago rather than a mere seven months			2
actors who 've given outstanding , complex performances are suddenly pleading for love like orphan puppies , parading from one show to another , forever on display			0
where are the handlers that used to manage the careers of stars , keeping them at a discreet distance from the fans and allowing them some semblance of mystery ? the irony is that as fewer people are going to movies , the annual spectacle that is the @entity9 is taking up greater and greater space in the public arena			1
the upside is supposed to be a rare communal pleasure -- the way such occasions ( as the @entity137 has it ) bring the country together			0
for once in our fragmented era , old and young , blue and red , presumably join hands in a virtual auditorium to admire some dresses and laugh at some jokes			0
but wait ! if i remember correctly ( and the evenings do blur into one another ) , our host last year was someone who had almost nothing to do with movies , who conducted a sort of insider colloquy with the designated demographic , young males who watch television			1
so much for cross-generational rapprochement			0
television grasping for viewers to lure advertisers , newspapers bumping up movie ads , the actors withering from overexposure and the films themselves all but anti-climactic in the final hour : how can even the best keep the sparkle of surprise ? " @entity41 " with its exquisite choreography and sly tease -- i 'm still trying to figure out who knew what when			2
@entity180 's ingenious " her , " a man - machine romance that proves that science fiction and sex are not mutually exclusive			0
when the night comes , i 'll watch of course			0
and vow to go to bed before midnight			0
after all , the @entity85 was worth watching just for @entity186 and @entity187 , and maybe @entity188 can make the long hours of sunday night , march 2 , tolerable this year			2
but in the meantime , i 'll fight my uphill battle to ignore @entity9 stories			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

film critic @entity194 does *n't* work for an outlet and can admit the @entity9 leave her cold
@entity199 : @entity9 rarely *honors* truly great or difficult films ; makes *obvious* choices
she says @entity9 and fashion coverage blots out all other news and goes on for months
@entity199 : films from early part of year ignored and the stars and movies are overexposed
