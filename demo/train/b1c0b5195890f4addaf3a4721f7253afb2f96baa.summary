@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 was a 33 - year - old it consultant living in @entity4 , @entity5 , last year when he settled in around midnight to get some work done			1
then , something unusual happened in his quiet town			0
and , as many of us do , he took to @entity11 to share			2
" helicopter hovering above @entity4 at 1am ( is a rare event ) , " he wrote			0
unbeknownst to him , @entity3 was stepping into one of the year 's biggest news stories : the @entity17 military operation that killed notorious terrorist leader @entity18			1
in the days that followed , he 'd become " the man who live - tweeted @entity18 's death			2
" at the @entity23 festival here on saturday , @entity3 discussed that night , as well as how it thrust him into the still - emerging role of " citizen journalist			1
" so , does posting on @entity11 about a big event really make someone a journalist ? @entity3 says yes -- even if he did n't think so at the time			1
" the people who were talking , we were just trying to reverse - engineer what could have happened , " he said			1
" the media was not there at the time ...			0
" we were just trying to see what could have happened because we knew the official story would probably not be the whole truth			0
" @entity3 's tweets may have been the first public account of the nighttime raid by the now - famous @entity44 that killed @entity18 at his secret compound			1
but the significance of his posts would n't become clear until hours later , when president @entity48 called a rare evening press conference to announce the news			0
in posts sometimes sprinkled with humor ( " go away helicopter - before i take out my giant swatter " ) , @entity3 's tweets evolved that night from his observations to messaging with a handful of other @entity5 in @entity4 and elsewhere to get to the bottom of things			2
and that , said @entity61 , who studies media trends with the @entity63 , is what made him a journalist			0
" some people say tweeting about a helicopter does n't make you a journalist and i would agree with that , " said @entity61 , who shared saturday 's discussion with @entity3			1
" but the things he did next -- i think he acted very much in that way			0
" those things included photographing @entity18 's compound , about a mile from @entity3 's home , the following day and conducting his own interviews with neighbors about their experiences living there			1
in an era when mobile - phone owners walk around with a video camera in their pocket at all times and tools like @entity11 , @entity88 and @entity89 make broadcasting the results quick and simple , people like @entity3 can turn into journalists without even knowing it , @entity61 said			1
some critics of the concept of citizen journalism note that non-professionals are n't trained to properly filter and communicate news -- that we would n't trust a " citizen doctor			2
" but @entity61 notes that , in the case of accidents or emergencies , we do just that			0
" it 's ' first - aid journalism ' or ' first - responder ' journalism , " he said			2
" later , they 're going to hand it off to someone who has a more developed skill set , but they are similar skill sets			0
" in the days that followed his soon - famous tweets , @entity3 got a look at the inner workings of parts of more mainstream journalism , and was n't always impressed			1
he was pressured to do exclusive interviews ( about information he shared on @entity11 with the world , he noted ) , offered money for his story and watched as some international journalists painted what he said was an inaccurate picture of @entity4 by only focusing on poverty - stricken areas and conservative @entity127 there			1
one tangible result of his brief fling with spotlight ? the 750 or so @entity11 followers he had the day before the raid swelled to about 105,000 -- before eventually settling in at around 70,000			2
the urge to become an international news source , though , has not been strong			0
" i think i only wore the hat of journalism for a few days , " he said			0
" and then i took it off			0

@entity3 was thrust into the spotlight last year by *unknowingly* tweeting @entity18 raid
the it consultant was " just trying to reverse - engineer what could have happened , " he said
his @entity11 activity puts focus on the role of citizen journalists in a *digital* world
journalism expert says @entity3 became a journalist when he began *digging* for information
