@entity1 's tourism board should thank @entity2 and @entity3			1
" @entity4 -- a company of @entity9 " is the pair 's stunning five - minute video comprising 60,000 photos taken between 2010 and 2014 by @entity2			1
if you 're not inspired to head to @entity12 after seeing it , you probably did n't full - screen this tribute to @entity12 beauty			2
the music is composed by @entity3			0
@entity2 , 29 , became interested in astronomy a decade ago and has been practicing astrophotography for the last seven years			1
what 's on his list of must - have equipment and his secrets for capturing a " bigger " moon ? he shared that and more with @entity28			1
@entity28 : what inspired you to create this gorgeous video ? @entity2 : this is my fifth time - lapse video so far and it was inspired by my love for @entity36 island , my birthplace -- its long and rich history , breathtaking landscapes and my passion for the night sky			1
it 's a dreamy , magical thing to look up in the sky and watch the stars , our neighbors , traveling to distant lands ! @entity28 : what makes @entity36 a good place for stargazing ? @entity2 : @entity1 's night sky is not perfect but we still enjoy dark skies and see lot of celestial objects within the city walls of the @entity57 of @entity36 -- a @entity58 -- next to our monuments			1
what could be more beautiful than seeing @entity62 's rings or clouds and @entity65 's @entity64 from the @entity66 , one of the largest squares in @entity69 with @entity71 fortifications and @entity73 and @entity74 buildings ? @entity1 also has an important astronomical heritage			1
the first @entity76 of @entity12 was founded in @entity36 in [ 1927 ] by @entity73 astronomer @entity77			2
both @entity78 and the @entity80 astronomer @entity79 have a lunar crater named after them and @entity79 also has an eponymous @entity84 crater			0
@entity28 : what 's your advice for budding astrophotographers ? @entity2 : experience and knowledge are the most valuable tools			1
one needs to know how the celestial objects move and how to capture them with the camera			0
until you get better , take as many photos as you can			0
the weather is n't always our ally and we often have to wait for more than a month for a clear sky			0
one should n't give up easily , otherwise you might miss that one special photo that could come when you least expect it			0
@entity28 : what equipment do you use ? @entity2 : a photo camera that can capture long - exposure images , a tripod and a remote control for the camera			1
i started with a dslr @entity112 and a tripod			0
now i also have three other dslr 's for nightscapes and landscapes			2
some are specially modified to capture in infrared			0
i 've got some ccd cameras especially for planetary photography , like the @entity122 camera			0
i also use telephoto lenses like @entity124 - 200 f2.8 or @entity125 - 400mm f4 as well as telescopes like the @entity127 f7.5 or @entity128 f7.7			2
also very useful is planetarium software like @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
they help you identify the stars or planets easily as well as calculate where the stellar objects will rise and set on the horizon			0
with software like the photographer 's @entity142 ( @entity144 ) , we can calculate where we should be			2
@entity28 : what are your favorite shots in the video ? @entity2 : there are so many memorable ones			1
the one with the big fireball at 2:39 that blinded us and turned the sky blue or the one with the honeymooners and the lighthouse at 3:49 are good examples			0
for that shot , i was calculating for hours how to shoot my just - married sister inside the august full moon			2
but i ( ended up ) missing them by setting up the telescope just two meters wrong -- a very difficult shot when you 're using a 1,000 - millimeter telescope with almost 150 kilos of equipment			1
but my very best is the one with the @entity170 ( when the full moon is at its closest point to @entity172 in its orbit ) and the @entity174 of @entity36 at 3:21			1
the result would look great even if it was a cloudy night -- i set up in the right place at the right time			1
@entity28 : in some of the shots , the moon looks enormous -- how did you do that ? @entity2 : you set up up the telephoto lens or a telescope at least a few kilometers away from the landscape you want to include in the shot			1
use a lens with a long focal length to magnify the moon from afar			0
for example , the shot with the moon rising behind the @entity174 was shot eight kilometers away using a 1,000 - millimeter lens			2
theoretically , you can capture a full moon every 29 days from a different azimuth 76 ° - 116 ° but it 's actually challenging to shoot the moon due to the unpredictable weather and difficulty in getting the exact shooting angle correct			2
after calculating the exact point of the azimuth and setting up where you can put the landscape in the same shot , you 'll then need a clear horizon			0
i manage to capture the moon only a few times every year			0
so the shots in the video are from 2010 till february 2014			0
@entity28 : the most time - consuming process is ... @entity2 : some shots took more than eight to nine hours of continuous capturing			1
i climbed up the cliff with my camera and telescope for almost eight hours continuously to capture the shot with the trees			0
the shots with the moon took an hour or two , but it required an hour or two of pre-calculation for where to set up , and then we had to be there an hour earlier with the heavy equipment			2
but that is not the end -- we had to process thousands of raw pictures			0
it took me more than a month to archive my 200,000 pictures of time - lapse to a library of more than 1.5 million pictures i have			1
then , it took us another month to create the video with the right shots and the right sound			0
@entity28 : the best places to photograph @entity36 are ... @entity2 : to capture the old town of @entity36 in the photograph , the best angle is from @entity240 , about seven kilometers northwest of @entity36 town			1
other beautiful places with a nice dark sky include @entity244 ( @entity245 ) in southwest @entity36 and near @entity246 just above @entity247			1
@entity28 : what are your favorite places to photograph @entity12 ? @entity2 : i once captured nice star photographs from the @entity254 mountains at @entity255 in southern @entity12 , with a perfect dark sky			1
@entity257 at the city of @entity259 and the @entity261 mountain range both yield beautiful photos			0
more of @entity2 ' videos can be found on his @entity265 page .			2

@entity2 captured @entity36 's starry night in a five - minute time - lapse video , " @entity4 -- a company of @entity9 "
right equipment , knowledge and patience are the keys to astrophotography , he says
@entity2 shares his tips for photographing the moon so it looks enormous
@entity244 is one of the best spots to photograph @entity1 's nightscapes
