-- born without the lower portion of his spine , @entity1 was given just a week to live			1
medical staff deemed his condition so severe they even asked his parents if they actually wanted to take him home			2
yet @entity8 and @entity9 had no doubts about that , and their youngest son has gone on to claim three @entity14 gold medals , win the @entity15 to @entity16 , trek the notoriously - challenging @entity17 and lunch with @entity20 's @entity19 along the way			1
it 's a mightily impressive collection but in his earliest moments , the prospect of such an action - packed life looked decidedly slim			2
" there was quite a period of time when they were n't sure whether i would live out the hour , the day , the week , the month , " the @entity34 , 33 , tells @entity0 's @entity28 series			1
" it was slowly after we had been transferred to @entity15 that there was the understanding i might be here to hang around , and my parents were then allowed to choose to take me back home -- even though they were offered alternatives			0
" despite his condition -- sacral agenesis , which affects approximately one in 25,000 births -- young @entity45 was constantly told by his parents that he was no different to his four elder siblings and that he could achieve anything he wanted			2
so they perhaps should n't have been so surprised when he informed them of his choice of career			0
" telling @entity51 and @entity52 that i was turning down my place at university to be a teacher to become a wheelchair racer instead , i could have been sitting across from them saying i wanted to be a professional unicorn hunter , " @entity1 recalls			1
but he was backed to the hilt -- and not just by his family			0
growing up in the tiny @entity62 village of @entity63 , whose population even now is little more than 250 , @entity1 was much - loved and terrifically supported			1
despite having legs so weak that they can not support his weight , he would enter high jump competitions and play rugby league among other sporting pursuits -- and this indomitable spirit did not go unnoticed			0
so when he had to turn down an invite to compete in the @entity73 because he knew his family lacked the funds to send him , the people of @entity63 came to the rescue -- raising enough money within a week to buy both his flight and a racing chair			0
two decades on , the boy from the backwater has become a byword for bravery and belief -- and he did go on to become a teacher , qualified in physical education , as well			2
" there were two turning points in my sporting aspirations			0
one of them would have been when i started to realize that i was n't going to play cricket or rugby league for @entity93 as i was n't competitive in that line , " he says with a grin			0
" then there was the introduction to what my life is now -- wheelchair sports			2
i was about 13 - 14 when introduced to that lifestyle and culture			0
" " it was 1994 and i saw these guys who were just these big men and better than any footballer or cricketer			0
they were these gladiators and i loved it			0
" i wanted to be them and here i am 20 years later			0
i think i 'm almost there			0
" @entity1 's modesty grossly belies his herculean feats			1
this is a man who can boast six silver medals and two bronzes on top of the three golds he has won since first competing at the @entity14 in 2000 , on home soil in @entity15			1
this is a man whose times in his 5,000 meters and marathon category ( @entity125 ) have never been beaten			2
and this is a man who has won a staggering 35 marathons out of the 54 he has contested around the world -- finishing on the podium another 14 times			2
" the thing i love about racing wheelchairs is that when i get into my wheelchair , there is not another person in the world that is more made to do what i do , " explains @entity1 , who won 1,500m silver at last month 's @entity134			1
" there are moments when you are racing that the speed is at a certain level or you 're taking a corner at the right speed -- and at that moment , you feel like you are absolutely perfect and that this is what you are meant to do			0
it 's an incredible feeling			2
" and @entity1 , who stands just 4 foot 7 inches and weighs around 50 kg , is an incredible competitor			1
he won 2004 @entity14 gold after suffering a puncture with five kilometers still left to race , under a fierce @entity156 sun. two years later , he set a record time in the @entity157 despite falling over when hitting a pothole			1
" the most important quality any athlete needs is resilience			0
it 's essential for a marathoner , " says a man who has also survived two serious car crashes , one of them while in his wheelchair			1
yet merely relaying @entity1 's professional exploits does n't come close to conveying the fullness of his extraordinary drive and ambition			1
just consider his approach to the @entity17 , a testing single - file trek that runs 96 kilometers ( 59 miles ) through the mountains of @entity174			1
the path 's rugged nature and precipitous river crossings are so challenging it can take any able - bodied person anywhere from 4 - 12 days to traverse it , so one can barely imagine the difficulties endured for someone who chooses -- in @entity1 's own words -- to " crawl " across it			1
nonetheless , he took it on for both charitable and patriotic reasons			0
in 1942 , @entity187 wanted to seize control of what was then @entity174 before launching a direct assault on the @entity34 mainland lying south , with seven months of intense fighting required before being ultimately repelled			1
" the @entity17 is the only sport in the world where @entity93 has really fought for the direct defense of @entity93			1
it holds unlimited important to who we are as a nation , " @entity1 says			1
" it is 96 kilometers of mud and untold amounts of hills			0
the hills are these mudslides that are covered in a honeycomb of tree routes where you just have to try to keep trudging on			0
" i crawled it in 2009 , and it feels like it was a lifetime ago			2
i often wonder how it actually took place			0
when i was asked in the lead - up to it , it was just ' why not ? ' if i think i can do something somewhere in the world and i want to , then would n't i make that happen ? " it 's an attitude that sits very comfortably alongside his approach to life			1
" my motto is probably that struggling is alright , and any struggling is strengthening , " he says			0
for precisely this reason , he chose to spend his @entity229 holiday in 2011 on board the 100 - foot @entity231 as it won the famous @entity15 to @entity16 race			2
being pummeled by waves and tossed around a buccaneering boat is not everyone 's idea of fun but for the pragmatic @entity1 -- who also has a love of surfing -- it was all a way of readying himself for the @entity241 in @entity242			1
" i have had some incredible experiences outside of wheelchair racing , such as sitting down with 12 other people for lunch two years ago and one of them being the @entity19 , " he smiles , referring to his meeting with visiting @entity20 royalty			2
" finding myself on board a yacht on the @entity15 to @entity16 and winning by 300 meters , having crawled around on this thing for 58 hours -- crawling , in the middle of the night , through people 's vomit just doing my job and whatever needed to happen			1
" in spite of his unorthodox methods and his intense training regime , @entity1 failed in his objective to win the 2012 @entity14 marathon in his category			1
yet he was involved in one of the great @entity14 races , taking bronze even though he finished less than a second by the winner			1
so he is unequivocal when asked to describe the biggest challenge of what has been a gloriously colorful career			0
" i would say the next one -- turning up at the @entity272 in two years ' time to try to get back to that number one position , " he ventures			0
" people may think there is not a lot between first and second ( and third ) place			0
in my case it was 0.8 of a second over a marathon , but that 0.8 of a second is absolutely everything in my sport			2
" so i would say that the biggest challenge that i would ever have come through over the last 20 years will be trying to rectify that 0.8 of a second in the next two years			0

@entity1 is one of the world 's most *successful* wheelchair racers
he has *overcome* physical limitations caused by rare spinal condition
@entity34 has crawled @entity17 and crewed in testing yacht race
he is seeking to regain his marathon crown at 2016 @entity14
