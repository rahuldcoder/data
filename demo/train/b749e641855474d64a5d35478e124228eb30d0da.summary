-- @entity1 is one of the best connected men in the music industry			1
the 34 - year - old producer and @entity5 has collaborated with some of the biggest names in music , producing @entity9 's 2006 " @entity13 " album , reworking songs from seminal @entity12 bands @entity14 and @entity15 and working with @entity16 and @entity17 among other musical luminaries			1
coming from a wealthy family in @entity20 , @entity1 grew up with music and celebrity at the kitchen table before making his name as a dj on the @entity26 club scene in the early 1990s			1
moving our from behind the decks @entity1 took to producing other artists and has picked up awards for his work in the studio including a @entity33 for @entity34 in 2008			1
a rare thing for a producer , he 's almost as well known as some of the big name musicians he works with , but @entity1 's latest project sees him taking the stage with his new band @entity41 for @entity1 it 's not such a radical departure from his previous work or how he sees himself			1
" i think we live in an era certainly where it 's not unusual to be many things , especially in music , " he told @entity0			2
" now i 'm in a slightly more unique position of actually being an artist in the front of my own record and putting them out as well producing them , but it seems to all fit			2
" described by his childhood friend @entity57 as " very driven ... you would n't think he 's so ambitious from meeting him because he 's so relaxed , " @entity1 is taking his varied career and lifestyle in his stride			1
@entity0 talked to him about his musical identity and being the man with the golden rolodex			2
@entity0 : do you think of yourself as the master of collaborations ? @entity1 : i just think that because my own albums are more collaborative affairs ... i 've got this tag of master collaborator , but i do n't think it 's necessarily true			1
if this was a report card from school , it would say " plays well with others			0
" that 's one of the things that helps and more importantly i grew up liking such a wide range of music that i love working in different genres			2
not being stuck in one genre definitely widens the palette of the kind of people you can work with			0
@entity0 : are you affected by fame ? @entity93 : i 'm sort of lucky to live in @entity26 where i live a pretty anonymous lifestyle anyway			1
i 'm a bit more aware of it when i come [ to @entity98 ] and sometimes i think i 'm almost naive to think it does n't exist			0
i 'd still like to think that i could just live the same life i did 3 years ago , going on the @entity101 , or going to see a band and walking around the front to watch and realizing that i 'll probably just have to stand here and take pictures with people 's camera phones , which is fun			2
i 'm not mobbed , nobody really cares that much about my life and i just get to live it how i would otherwise			0
@entity0 : do you see yourself as responsible for making @entity9 a star ? @entity93 : i definitely did n't make @entity9 a star			1
i helped her find a great sound that really fitted well with what she wanted to do			0
in her songs there 's a lot of heartache and remorse and regret and fire that was in a lot of music , jazz and soul of the ' 50s and ' 60s			2
and it was also that we gave it a modern twist ... i added drums from hip - hop ; i wanted to make a modern soul record that if @entity137 from @entity138 heard he would 've wanted to sample it			1
so if anything , i think @entity9 is more responsible for me being where i am than maybe the other way around			1
watch @entity1 talking about @entity9 's " rehab " @entity0 : are you a pragmatist or a pessimist ? @entity93 : i 'm a pragmatist			1
the first record i produced was for this artist @entity146			0
it was on @entity149 , there was this hype about it and everyone thought it was going to be this big thing and it came out and it really did n't do anything			0
and i thought that was a really good lesson in a way because it lets you know that no matter how many people come out telling you it 's going to be great , it could easily come out and do nothing			0
@entity0 : you 're thought of as the man with the golden rolodex			0
is that true ? @entity93 : the only people i know really that are bold faced names who are considered " celebs " are musicians			2
it 's not likely you open up my phone and see @entity174 and @entity175			0
these are just musicians that i work with and a few of them happen to be famous , so people go , " oh , your famous friends ! " they are n't really , they are just co-workers anyway			0
@entity0 : were contacts the key to your early success ? @entity93 : it 's just not even worth arguing with that because it 's so far away from the truth			0
i ca n't run around refuting the fact that i came from a comfortable upbringing			0
but the fact that i had any help and connections getting into what i did is well , it 's just not true			0
one of my favorite " old skool " hip - hop records is " @entity196 " by @entity197 and @entity198 , and it 's got a classic line , " it 's not where you 're from , it 's where you 're at " which always applies in hip - hop			1
i was just a good dj who got better because of an enthusiasm for music and playing out			1
once people became aware of me outside that more insular hip - hop scene they were kind of like " oh , how did he get here ? must be because of his parents			1
" and they have to find something to say and that was one of the criticisms they chose			0
