-- dear @entity1 , where do i begin ? normally , i write about health care , but your essay in @entity7 , " @entity8 , " caught my attention for reasons that have nothing to do with medicine			1
before i read it , i barely had any idea who you were			2
your name was vaguely familiar , probably from having seen you on @entity17 while channel - surfing in the wee hours			2
i 'm not the only one who noticed			2
last i checked , your essay was one of the most read and e-mailed articles at @entity7			1
but you did it with a xenophobic , even racist , rant against @entity29 like me and a lot of other people i care about and deeply respect			1
read @entity1 's essay , " @entity8 " have no illusions , sir			1
what you wrote was not funny , insightful , smart or unique			2
no. every word , phrase , sentence and paragraph you produced did nothing more than distill the ancient , proud and diverse culture of @entity42 down to nothing more than clichés and stereotypes			1
calling us dot - heads and @entity49 , speaking of spicy food and multilimbed gods with elephant noses -- clarification , @entity1 : @entity53 has the elephant nose ; @entity55 has the multiple arms			1
you did it even when you were laying on the backhanded compliments			2
" we all assumed @entity42 were geniuses			2
by the way , i am not some bitter old man trying to lecture you			2
you and i are contemporaries			0
i 'm just a year younger than you are			0
in reading a little bit about you , we have some things in common			0
i was " dorky enough " to have played @entity70 growing up			0
given your esteemed education at @entity72 , i suspect both of us excelled academically			0
but it 's clear that our consciences have been on divergent paths			1
i try to do just a little bit of good in the world by practicing medicine and writing			0
you took your pricey education and became ... a humorist ... a satirist ... a pundit ? a descendant of @entity86 , @entity87 or @entity85 you are not			0
in the future , please leave satire and humor to trained professionals			1
so ... because you were n't funny or incisive , what 's your point ? are you trying to make @entity42 prove our worth to the fraternity that is @entity97 ? is your essay part of some kind of hazing ? put up with your callous insults , and we 'll be able to live in the frat house ? what litmus test do we all have to pass to become bona fide ? does our @entity106 have to wear a big white beard and have only two arms ? do we have to turn in the dots on our foreheads for a baseball cap with " @entity112 " stenciled on it ? trade in our samosas and chai for potato chips and @entity117 ? should we make our parents throw their hindi language newsmagazine in the garbage and subscribe to @entity7 ? if it 's about fitting in with your standards of @entity124 , please , allow me to prove my culture 's utility to you			1
some of us have become wildly successful			0
we run @entity129 companies , have been elected to political office and have won @entity132 prizes			0
many of us work 40 - plus hours a week to pay our mortgage			0
some have paid their dues serving this country in war			0
still others struggle to pay the bills , keep their children fed or their marriages together ; and yes , there are those of us who are criminals locked up in jail			0
in other words , we 're just like everyone else			0
it 's obvious that you were waxing nostalgic about your hometown			1
if i follow your logic here , should nothing ever change in @entity97 ? should moms stay at home while we men wear our suits and ties and head off to work , cigarette in hand ? should african - americans still drink from a different water fountain from you ? should we revoke the right of women to vote ? if that 's the case , i 've got a @entity168 with a flux capacitor i 'd be happy to sell you to get " @entity171			1
" i also read the apology you pinned to the bottom of the online version of your essay			1
" i truly feel stomach - sick that i hurt so many people			2
i was trying to explain how , as someone who believes that immigration has enriched @entity97 life and my hometown in particular , i was shocked that i could feel a tiny bit uncomfortable with my changing town when i went to visit it			1
if we could understand that reaction , we 'd be better equipped to debate people on the other side of the immigration issue , " you wrote			1
" @entity190 bit uncomfortable , " indeed			0
you should have stopped with " i 'm sorry " or just retracted the whole article			0
stop trying to save face by trying to rationalize what you wrote or pin it to the immigration issue			2
finally , i do want to thank you for harshly reminding of one thing : because the essay was published just before the @entity198 -- and incidentally , just a few weeks before @entity42 's own independence day -- you and your publication reminded me with no uncertainty that racism , ignorance and fear of new people are as @entity97 as apple pie and @entity7			1
like you said , the @entity207 should shed a tear			0
( @entity210 is the parent company of @entity0 and @entity7			0
) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

@entity213 takes issue with @entity1 's *column* about @entity29 in his hometown
essay was meant to be satire , but @entity213 found it a xenophobic , racist rant
@entity213 says writer distilled ancient and diverse culture into clichés and stereotypes
says the piece reminded him ignorance about and fear of new people still exist in @entity97
