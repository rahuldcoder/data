-- in @entity3 's northern @entity2 , @entity1 is on the hunt to unearth ancient settlements , pyramids and tombs lost in the sands of time			1
rather than digging through the dirt in a dusty trench , trowel in hand , the @entity9 has turned her eyes to the stars			2
@entity1 is a space archaeologist who uses satellites , initially designed for use by the military , to identify potential sub-surface remains			1
" when people initially think of the term " space archaeologist " they think ' oh it 's someone who uses satellites to look for alien settlements on @entity24 or in outer space ' but the opposite is true -- we 're actually looking for evidence of past human life on planet earth , " she says			1
the high - resolution satellites , with infrared and thermal capabilities , sit in orbit almost 500 kilometers above the @entity38 and can precisely pinpoint objects on terra firm less than a meter in diameter			0
the infrared light used by the satellites has longer wavelengths than visible light and thus can penetrate the earth 's surface			0
the space archaeologist takes the satellite images and processes them to identify subtle anomalies on the earth 's surface			1
" all of these secrets are in the ground waiting for us to find them			0
the answers are there , " says @entity1 , who is also an assistant professor of archeology at the @entity58 ( @entity58 )			1
" the most exciting part of my job ( is ) the idea that by mapping out archaeological sites , by using new technologies and trying to think very differently about how we see landscapes , we have a better chance of understanding who we are and what we are doing here			0
" use of remote - sensing technology in search of ancient sites is revolutionizing the field of archeology			1
in 2011 , @entity1 and her team announced they located 17 pyramids in addition to 1,000 tombs and 3,100 ancient settlements in a documentary for the @entity85			1
then in a project last year , @entity1 spent months trekking across the ancient @entity87 , traveling to @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , uncovering sites identified from space , finding an amphitheater and potential location for the famed @entity96			1
" i keep being surprised by the amount of archaeological sites and features that are left to find all over the world , " says @entity1			1
having spent the last 15 years working in @entity3 alongside her husband and fellow archaeologist @entity103 on various surveys and excavations , the country holds a special place in @entity1 's heart			1
and after the @entity110 movement spread across the @entity111 , rumors started circulating of locals looting ancient sites			2
now the @entity9 is developing new techniques so she can work with governments and international organizations to try to prevent the situation from getting worse			0
" we 've found that patterns of site looting have increased between 500 and 1000 percent since the start of the @entity110			2
now this is a problem as old as human beings , " she says			0
" people were looting tombs 5,000 years ago in @entity3 as soon as people were buried but the problem is only getting worse and worse			2
" in addition to her archaeological fieldwork , @entity1 spends much of her time as an educator at @entity58 and lecturing around the world			1
" if you really want to be a good archaeologist , you have to understand ancient dna , you have to understand chemical analysis to figure out the composition of ancient pots			2
you have to be able to study human remains			0
you need to be able to do computer processing and in some cases , computer programing			0
" it 's not a bunch of old folks just digging in the dirt , which is fun , but there 's this whole other world that we can study and the key is science so i try to speak to school groups , and i try to take a lot of time with young people after i present at conferences , " she says			0
the @entity9 is n't the only one using aerial technology to advance archeology in june , the @entity161 - based @entity160 released a report where a consortium of archaeologists used airborne lasers to survey @entity167 's @entity166			0
the team also announced the remarkable existence of a medieval city hidden beneath the dense jungle			0
@entity0 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this piece .			0

@entity1 is an *egyptologist* and professor at the @entity58 at @entity177
the space archaeologist uses satellite imaging to locate lost settlements and pyramids
also called " remote sensing , " the satellite imagery can also be used to *crackdown* on looting
