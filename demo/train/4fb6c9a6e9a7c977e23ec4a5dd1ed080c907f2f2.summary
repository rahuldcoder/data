-- @entity3 ceo @entity2 's new initiative , @entity1 , is a global partnership aimed at " making internet access available to all			1
" is that an attainable goal ? perhaps			0
it 's certainly very ambitious			2
there are several major hurdles to overcome			1
opinion : @entity2 's big idea is no charity for many of the 5 billion people who live in less developed parts of the world , the two largest barriers to becoming @entity16 - connected are the cost of devices and the cost of connection			1
the next obstacle is the expense of maintaining a device			0
in many countries , electricity is still difficult to come by , with brownouts common			0
in @entity33 , for example , people experience an average of 56 days of power outage a year , almost 15 % of the year			1
even if a network is running , the cost of electricity itself is very expensive			0
the cost of a kilowatt hour of electricity in @entity33 can vary anywhere from $ 0.06 in @entity33 to $ 0.68 in @entity43			1
a phone like an @entity45 requires about 3.73 kwh a year to charge depending on use , meaning it could cost as much as $ 2.53 a year to just charge the phone			0
while this does not sound like a lot of money , the average income for a person in @entity43 is about $ 2,000 , which means that 0.1 % of annual income would be spent just on the electricity to power a phone			2
of course , this cost increases with more use			0
typical usage in developing areas like @entity33 focuses on low consumption actions like sending sms messages , phone calls and mobile banking			1
more demanding usage like streaming video , downloading and playing games , and spending time connecting on social networking sites , would require the most energy intensive part of the phone -- the screen -- to be on longer , which would raise the yearly costs of charging the phone			0
increasing the battery life and decreasing the energy requirements of transmission are great goals to strive for -- as @entity1 plans to pursue -- but they do not address the underlying issue of being able to afford a charge in the first place			2
when the average yearly income is so low in developing countries , there is not much disposable income after housing , food and transportation costs			1
the fact of the matter is that most of the 5 billion people who are poor would rather spend their money on basic necessities like food and medicine than on the @entity16			1
for example , a few years ago i visited an orphanage in @entity100 , @entity101 , that had no internet connection even though a major fiber line is about 50 yards away			2
while the heads of the orphanage understood the importance of the @entity16 , and while many of the children would have liked to explore the @entity110 , funds were better spent caring for the orphans			0
even giving the connectivity away does not help pay all the other costs associated with accessing the @entity16			0
if we really want to get the next 5 billion people connected , we will have to steer governmental and consumer electronic interests to work together on a solution			1
innovating new and inventive techniques to provide infrastructure , low - cost devices and energy generation stand the best chance of making a difference			0
maybe @entity1 can look into devices like kinetic chargers , solar powered cell phones , and pico cells , which can make a far bigger impact to connect the underserved populations of the world			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			2

@entity2 is starting an initiative to bring internet access to 5 billion people
@entity140 : @entity1 is very ambitious but there are major hurdles to overcome
he says that connectivity is *unaffordable* for most people in the developing world
@entity134 : in places like @entity33 , there is not much disposable income left after paying for food
