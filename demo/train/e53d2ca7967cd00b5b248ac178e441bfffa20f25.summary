video showing @entity1 rocking and hunched over upon hearing remains had been found in the search for her 2 - year - old daughter was released friday , after a @entity7 judge overturned a decision to seal the footage because it was considered inflammatory			1
the security video -- which has no audio and was taken in a " waiting area of the medical facility " at a county jail -- was taken in december 2008 after remains were discovered in woods near her grandparent 's @entity19 home			1
by that point , the girl had n't been seen in public for six months and investigators had spent five months looking for her			0
just over a week later , on december 19 , 2008 , authorities determined the remains were those of young @entity1			0
in the footage , @entity1 is seen rocking back and forth in a chair			0
after a few minutes , law enforcement officers talk to @entity32 and take her to another room			2
@entity36 superior court chief judge @entity35 issued his ruling on friday afternoon , two days after a hearing in response to @entity19 tv station @entity41 's july motion to unseal the footage			1
in his decision , @entity35 recalled how then judge @entity44 had sealed the video in may 2009 , saying that while he was " loathe to shield any public record " he believed that it was inflammatory			1
@entity32 's defense team , in a motion filed in 2009 , cited testimony from two @entity52 employees stating they felt it was " cruel " that the then - suspect was " distressed " in the waiting room for 30 to 45 minutes on the day news broke that the remains were found			1
the television was on in the room , broadcasting news about the discovery , according to court testimony			0
at the time , @entity32 was awaiting trial on murder charges and others related to the death of her young daughter			0
a jury acquitted her on that and other charges in july , though she was convicted on four lesser charges related to misleading authorities in the case			0
" the reason for sealing ( the video ) -- ms. @entity32 's right to a fair trial -- is no longer applicable because the trial has been completed and she has been acquitted of all charges other than lying to law enforcement officers , " wrote @entity35 , before ordering the state attorney 's office to release the video			1
during wednesday 's hearing , defense attorney @entity85 argued that the @entity87 prevented the tape from being released in public because @entity90 received medical attention while she was in the waiting room			1
the news station argued that regulations pertain to medical data and not treatment , and insisted that the tape is part of the public record			2
in his ruling , @entity35 found that " the jail video does not constitute a medical record or other form of health care data relating to the evaluation or treatment of ms. @entity32 's physical or mental health condition			1
" the judge also added that " there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in jail			2
" the ruling is the latest setback for @entity32 and her defense team			0
last week , @entity35 ordered her to pay $ 217,000 to authorities for costs related to investigating @entity1 's disappearance			2
officials had argued that if it were not for the 25 - year - old @entity19 woman 's lies , investigators would not have had to spend the time and money to find her daughter 's body			0
@entity32 's attorneys have claimed that @entity1 died accidentally when she drowned in the family 's ' pool .			0

new : @entity32 was in jail room where tv carried news remains had been found
in the video , @entity32 is *sitting* in the waiting room of a jail medical facility
judge @entity35 says there 's no privacy in jail and @entity87 regulations do n't apply
another judge had sealed the video in 2009 , calling its *content* inflammatory
