-- in a dusty old attic in @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 was rummaging through dilapidated boxes left there by his father many years before , when he came across an interesting find			1
in one of the battered boxes was an audio reel marked , " dr. @entity13 interview , dec. 21 , 1960			1
" " i 'm a rummager , a packrat , " said @entity5			2
" that piqued my interest			0
" @entity18 acquired a reel - to - reel player and listened to what sounded like his father interviewing dr. @entity13 about nonviolence and the civil rights movement			1
" i could not believe what i was hearing , " said @entity5			0
@entity5 's father had grown up in @entity4 during the years of racial tension , oppression , and the so - called " @entity30 " segregation laws			1
" he planned on writing a book on how bad things were back in that era , " said @entity5 , but he never finished it , " he fell ill , and is now in hospice care			0
" @entity5 's father 's recorded his conversation with @entity13 three years before the civil rights leader delivered his famous " @entity46 " speech in @entity41 , four years before president @entity42 signed the @entity43 into law and eight years before @entity13 was assassinated in @entity45 , across the state from where @entity5 's father lived			1
in the interview , @entity13 can clearly be heard discussing his definition of nonviolence , and its importance in the civil rights movement			1
" i would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end through moral means , " he said , " and it grows out of the whole concept of love , because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving spirit , he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves the opponent			0
" @entity13 continued , " i am convinced that when the history books are written in future years , historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our heritage , " he said			1
" it represents struggle on the highest level of dignity and discipline			0
" the rev. @entity75 , one of the founders of the @entity77 with @entity13 in 1957 , said the tapes are a reminder of the work king started that is not finished			2
" one of the things that occurred back then , we effectively communicated that nonviolence as a tactic , as a technique , was very effective for civil rights protests , " said @entity75			0
" what we failed to do was express it 's not just a tactic , but a way of life			2
" @entity75 went on , " we 're losing the battle of violence versus nonviolence as a means of resolving human conflict , " he said , " i hope dr. @entity13 's message , wherever it shows up will help us in the struggle			1
" in another part of @entity5 's recording , @entity13 describes a recent trip to @entity104			1
he explains to @entity5 's father the importance of the civil rights movement both in the @entity108 and abroad			2
" there is quite a bit of interest and concern in @entity104 for the situation in the @entity108			0
@entity104 leaders in general , and @entity104 people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and familiar with what has taken place , " he said , " we must solve this problem of racial injustice if expect to maintain our leadership in the world , and if we expect to maintain a moral voice in a world that is two thirds color			0
" the recording is intriguing to @entity128 , a professor of history and founding director of the @entity131 at @entity132			0
" it 's hard to know what we 're dealing with , " he said , " there are thousands of interviews with dr. @entity13 , and it 's hard to tell the historical significance of this ( one )			1
" " what is interesting about this is rather than just a transcript , you can hear his voice , " he added			0
in 1985 , @entity13 's widow , the late @entity146 , invited @entity128 to direct a long - term project to edit and publish the civil rights leader 's works			1
based on the dates , @entity128 believes the @entity104 trip @entity13 mentioned in the recording was his trip to @entity154			2
this is what @entity128 and his colleagues are most interested in			0
" the trip to @entity154 is something we do n't have a lot of information about , " he said , " in @entity154 he did n't do press conferences , did n't do interviews or write letters we know of			0
" @entity167 , a collector and expert on rare historical artifacts , authenticated the reel , and is working with @entity18 to arrange a sale through his @entity172 in @entity173			2
he says he hopes the recording will find a good home in a museum or at a university			0
" when i heard it , i got goose bumps all over , " @entity167 said , " it feels like he 's sitting in your living room and talking to you			2
" one scholar 's commitment to dr. @entity13 's teaching			1

the reel - to - reel tape is an interview from 1960
it was collecting dust in an attic in @entity3 , @entity4
the interview was recorded three years before @entity13 's " @entity46 " speech
the historical significance of the tape is *unclear*
