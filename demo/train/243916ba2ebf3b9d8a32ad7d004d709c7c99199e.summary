-- a @entity2 man is being investigated by police after apparently trying to put together a nuclear reactor in his apartment , @entity2 's nuclear watchdog said thursday			1
the man , named in local media reports as 31 - year - old @entity11 , contacted the @entity12 in july to ask whether he was allowed to build a nuclear reactor , the organization 's research director @entity7 told @entity0			1
that contact led the authorities to swoop down on his home in @entity17 , a coastal town of about 40,000 people known for its long sandy beaches			2
" we realized he probably had radioactive material at his home which you are not allowed to have without a permit , which was why the authorities decided to inspect his home , " @entity7 said			1
radioactive material was found during an " extensive " inspection last month , although testing suggested radiation levels were too low for his neighbors to be worried , @entity7 said			1
the material included " small amounts " of @entity38 , a component of smoke detectors which can not legally be removed from the detector casing , he said			1
the agency has not yet confirmed what other radioactive materials were found at the property			0
@entity11 was quoted by the @entity45 newspaper as saying he had his own @entity47 counter and had not noticed any problems with radiation			2
he never got the reactor going as he had just bought what was needed , @entity11 was quoted as saying , and now all his equipment has been taken away			0
@entity11 told the newspaper he intended to keep to the " theoretical level " in future			0
@entity7 said the situation was " extremely unusual " in @entity2			2
" i have n't heard of any similar things ever , " he said			0
according to the @entity60 @entity59 , the man - made radioactive metal americium " poses a significant risk " to health if ingested or inhaled			0
it recommends never dismantling or burning a smoke detector at home .			0

the man had @entity38 at his home , the @entity2 radiation watchdog says
he had asked *regulators* if he was allowed to build a nuclear reactor
testing suggested radiation levels were too low for his neighbors to be worried
