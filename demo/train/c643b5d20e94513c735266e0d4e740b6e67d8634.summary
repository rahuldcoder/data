@entity0 -- a divided @entity2 spent this week 's final oral argument on health care reform wednesday examining whether states would be " coerced " by the federal government to expand their share of @entity9 costs by the risk of losing funding if they refused to take part			1
the session concluded three days of public debate on the @entity16 and focused on the contentious legal issue of federal versus state powers , in this case involving the @entity9 government - run health care for the poor and disabled			1
@entity9 , which operates on federal and state funding , would be expanded under the health care reform law , and 26 states filed legal challenges against what they contended was an unfair burden forced on them by @entity0			1
@entity2 tackles question : would all of health law be scrapped ? the debate on @entity9 was especially divided along ideological lines			1
@entity36 , arguing for the states that say they would suffer under the new medicaid requirements , met skepticism from many on the left			0
justice @entity43 noted that 90 % of current @entity9 funding comes from @entity0 and asked if it would be a bad deal " if the government were to give boatloads of money to the states			1
" when @entity36 replied yes , @entity43 erupted , saying " wow , wow ! " and shaking her head			0
however , chief justice @entity51 and his conservative colleagues worried the states would be powerless to refuse the new requirements			0
" why not be concerned about the authority the federal government is exercising ? " @entity51 said to solicitor general @entity57 , who represented the government			0
" that is the leverage " the central bureaucracy holds , @entity51 noted			0
the " coercion " issue was surprisingly added to the health care debate by the @entity2 justices			1
@entity9 is administered by the states with a combination of federal and state money			1
it currently required coverage only for poor children and their parents or caretakers , adults with disabilities and poor individuals 65 or older			0
both sides of the issue agree that what the high court decides on @entity9 could have broad implications for the regulatory ability of the federal government to set long - term national policy goals in areas such as the environment , education and the workplace			1
some states have long complained their autonomy is being eroded by creeping federal intervention on spending matters			2
@entity92 1 of the @entity93 gives @entity94 the power to " lay and collect ... taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the @entity100 " and to " regulate commerce ... among the several states			0
" such authority has long been broadly interpreted , including when imposing conditions on recipients , be they individuals or states			0
no federal court has ever ruled states have been unlawfully coerced when they accept conditions or strings attached to federal funds			2
the @entity2 in 1987 affirmed that congressional discretion			0
starting in 2014 , the health care law 's @entity9 changes would make millions of additional @entity100 eligible for benefits by raising the income cap for qualification			1
that would include all adults up to 133 % of the federal poverty line			0
the tricky point is that states are not forced to agree to the law 's incremental @entity9 increases , spread out over six years			2
the states could instead abandon their participation in the program , but they say that would be a financial , social and political catastrophe -- one that they can not realistically accept			0
lawsuits by 26 @entity134 - led states say the new law 's significant expansion of the social safety net unconstitutionally " coerces " state governments			1
supporters of the health care law say the @entity9 issue involves political motivations rather than real policy concerns			1
" these arguments are n't based on @entity9 's health outcomes among children or seniors , " dr. l. @entity144 , the health care chair of the @entity146 , said at a news conference wednesday			1
" they are n't based on testimony from those who have received services from @entity9			2
they are n't even based on data that shows how well @entity9 controls costs compared to private insurance			2
that 's because the challenge to @entity9 in the @entity2 is n't based on what 's good for our health			2
it 's just based on politics and posturing			0
" @entity1 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
