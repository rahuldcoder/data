-- as president @entity2 vowed wednesday to help fight the influx of extremists vying for control in @entity7 's three - year civil war , anti-government fighters reported that jihadists in an eastern village methodically set fire to the homes and farms of those who openly opposed a hardline @entity14 offshoot			1
the act of retaliation is the latest in an offensive by the rogue @entity18 to capture rebel - held territory in the oil - rich @entity21 area along the @entity24 border			1
if @entity18 successfully wrests control of the border province , the extremist group notorious for its extreme interpretation of @entity28 law is set to feed a comeback campaign across the country by establishing a supply route connecting its bastion in the western @entity7 city of @entity36 with its home base in @entity24			1
@entity2 outlines foreign policy vision of ' might and right ' " @entity18 intends to resurge everywhere , " @entity40 , a @entity7 analyst at the @entity41 , tells @entity0			2
" @entity42 is just the first on the list of priorities because it is rich in oil and because of its strategic importance as a transit between @entity24 and @entity7			2
" other rebel groups unite to combat the push by @entity18 , 12 rebel battalions including @entity53 , a powerful @entity14 affiliate in @entity7 , formed the @entity55 in eastern @entity21 , earlier this week			1
" we found the only solution is for us to unite against @entity18			2
so all the battalions that were fighting them united financially , militarily and administratively and now work out of the same operation room , " @entity58 , a media activist linked to @entity59 insurgent groups , told @entity0 via @entity61 from eastern @entity21			0
the birth of the alliance followed weeks of brutal clashes between @entity18 and @entity53 fighters backed by @entity70 insurgents			2
the fighting forced at least 60,000 civilians to flee , according to the @entity73 , a @entity74 - based monitoring group			0
this is not the first time strained rebel fighters have diverted resources away from their primary objective of overthrowing president @entity80 to repel @entity18 aggression			1
early this year , a coordinated rebel offensive forced @entity18 to either withdraw or tactically secede from much of the country 's north			1
" at the direct insistence of foreign backers and the @entity88 , rebels fought @entity18 expecting a lot more support from their allies			1
the fact that this support did not come through is part of the reason for their return , " @entity40 tells @entity0			0
" my hope is we can right those wrongs			0
a lot of the people fighting on the ground have shown they have the will and the desire to stand up against @entity18 , but they need resources			2
" the @entity2 administration says it 's moving closer to finalizing a plan to expand military training and equip moderate @entity7 rebels , according to @entity111 officials			1
but with the @entity14 linked @entity53 leading the fight against @entity18 , @entity7 's allies will face challenges isolating nonextremists from increasingly radicalized opposition factions			1
' we are at a critical juncture in our fight against violent extremism and hope that the @entity120 and @entity111 can shrug off their fear of supporting us , " @entity123			2
gen. @entity124 , chief of staff of the @entity125 , said in a letter to @entity127 this week adding , " a failure to actively support the @entity129 now will lead to @entity18 ' successes internationally			2
" infighting creates humanitarian crisis @entity133 erupted last month when @entity18 launched a surprise attack on the border town of @entity136 , then stormed into the @entity42 countryside			1
@entity18 set off car bombs and executed rebel fighters in a terrifying campaign that left dozens dead , according to the @entity73			0
" the warfare is never - ending and the towns nearby are facing a serious humanitarian crisis and are very afraid			0
rumors spread like wildfire and families are constantly scared their village will be the target of the next massacre , " @entity58 tells @entity0			0
@entity18 has pushed through much of the east and set up checkpoints along the @entity152 across from the provincial capital of @entity42			0
the city remains under the control of @entity59 militias but is vulnerable to attacks from @entity7 troop positions to the north			0
" residents are very afraid of @entity18 and scared of the horrible stories about them , " @entity160 , a spokesperson for the opposition - run local committee in @entity21 , said			0
" plus we have near daily shelling from the regime , so life is very , very hard			0
" rebels claim the fate of @entity42 might soon parallel the @entity18 - controlled city of @entity36 , where human rights groups report public executions , the forced disappearance and torture of opponents and even mock crucifixions , but @entity40 says the ultraextremists do not have the resources to rule another population center			1
@entity14 central recognizes and supports @entity53 's fight against the government in @entity7 , but in an unprecedented move earlier this year , the group 's general command disowned @entity18 and blamed it for intrarebel fighting that has killed more than 3,300 people , a number reported by @entity73 in april			1
" we started this revolution for freedom , " @entity160 says , " so we can not accept any another organization coming and imposing its rules on us			0
" islamic militants claim @entity111 carried out suicide attack			0

the rogue @entity18 has alienated even other @entity14 groups
it 's feared that @entity18 could wrest control of a key border province with @entity24
more moderate rebels say they are *trapped* between @entity18 and the @entity80 regime
they plead with the @entity111 and the @entity88 to give them more aid
