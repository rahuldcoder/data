@entity0 -- the budgetary dispute that has delayed the opening of the @entity5 september 11 @entity4 has been resolved , according to @entity7 mayor @entity6 and @entity0 gov. @entity8			1
the museum was scheduled to open on the 11th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , but disagreements over funding , financing and oversight of the museum between the @entity17 and @entity18 and the @entity19 and @entity20 have halted construction			2
the foundation controls the memorial and museum ; the @entity19 and @entity20 owns the @entity26 site			1
late monday , all parties entered into a " memorandum of understanding , " an agreement that allows them to restart construction on the stalled museum project			0
" my goal during this period has been to get construction on the museum restarted , " said @entity6 , who is chairman of the @entity17 and @entity18			1
" this agreement ensures that it will be restarted very soon and will not stop until the museum is completed			1
" 11 years after , who are the terrorists ? the point of contention , $ 300 million that the @entity19 and @entity20 said it was owed by the @entity17 and @entity18 for additional design and construction costs , is being dropped in exchange for financial oversight of the museum and memorial , according to the memorandum			2
the @entity17 and @entity18 agreed to oversight from a committee composed of eight members : two appointed by the governor of @entity20 , two appointed by the governor of @entity0 and four by the memorial board			2
the foundation has agreed to have no less than six months of operating funds on hand at all times once the museum opens , though it 's not clear if the foundation can meet this requirement because it is hard to say exactly how much money the museum will bring in , and the memorandum does not outline specific ramifications if the foundation is unable to meet these financial obligations			0
revisiting the mosque at @entity69 the memorandum outlines a review of the project with the goal of determining the earliest possible opening date once construction resumes , though no date is set for the museum to open			0
all parties , according to the memorandum , will work toward opening individual sections of the museum as construction progress allows , which may mean a phased opening			0
this will allow the foundation to start collecting a $ 20 admission fee from visitors			0
constructed underground in the former @entity26 's " archaeological heart , " the museum will feature 110,000 square feet of exhibition space , according to the website for the @entity17 foundation			1
it will house a vast array of 9/11 artifacts , including " photographs , videotapes , voice messages , recovered property , clothing and other personal effects , workplace memorabilia , ( and ) incident - specific documents , " among other items , according to the site			0
located at the site of the former @entity26 , the @entity17 has two huge , square fountains that mark the footprints of the @entity26 towers that flow into granite reflecting pools at the center of the eight - acre , tree - lined plaza			1
bronze plates surround the fountains and bear the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks , as well as the six who were killed when a terrorist truck bomb exploded in the parking garage beneath the towers in 1993			0
9/11 responders wait for compensation for their illnesses @entity126 , a spokeswoman for the facility said the memorial , which opened september 12 , 2011 , has had 4.5 million visitors in its first year			1
