the world 's oldest commissioned warship is to undergo a £ 16 million revamp , in what @entity4 defense authorities hope will restore the iconic battleship that is so central to @entity4 's legacy as a maritime power			1
it will be the most extensive restoration to @entity10 in more than 200 years , when she underwent repairs following the @entity13			1
" it 's a massive task , " says project manager @entity14 of @entity15 , which has been contracted to carry out the works for five years with an option to extend that for a further five			2
however @entity14 believes a ship of this nature will always be a work in progress			2
" the first five years will be intense , but it 's ongoing forever , it needs constant work			2
" @entity10 was commissioned in 1778 and during three decades of service she saw some of the most legendary clashes			1
she 's the only surviving warship from the @entity31 , the @entity32 and the napoleonic wars			1
it 's for the @entity13 in the latter for which she is most well - known			2
the unsolved mystery of lost 19th century ' ghost ships ' as @entity40 's flagship , @entity10 served at the front of the battle on the @entity44 coast			1
the admiral was a hero of his day and well - respected for his strategic approach to battle			0
despite having fewer ships than the @entity51 - @entity44 fleet , @entity40 managed to lead the @entity4 to triumph			1
however it was to be @entity40 's last mission			0
he received a fatal hit by a lead ball on deck			0
he was taken below where he died			0
voyage to bottom of the sea for sir @entity62 's remains only 20 % of the vessel that stands today at @entity64 , on @entity66 's south coast , is from the original ship			1
the structure of the 246 - year - old warship still marvels modern day experts			0
" it 's a work of art , " says @entity14			0
he believes even nowadays ship builders would struggle to replicate parts of @entity10			1
over the centuries she 's undergone maintenance , but nothing of this magnitude			0
all of the outside of the hull will be re-planked , repairs will be made to the masts and work will be carried out on the interior			0
teams have been preparing for the works since july , however over the next few weeks the project will step up a gear			0
much of the restoration will be done by hand using traditional specialist skills , particularly when it comes to carving and shaping the wood			1
@entity14 hopes that throughout the project they 'll be able to train up new apprentices so that the art of repairing these types of ships is not lost			0
@entity4 's @entity100 has awarded the multi-million pound contract			1
while many would question why so much money is being invested into a project at a time of austerity in the @entity4 , those close to the project believe it 's essential to preserve something which is of so much importance to @entity4 and maritime history			1
" we ca n't just leave it , " says @entity14			0
such is the fragile nature of the ship , and because of its susceptibility to the elements , restoration must be carried out now or otherwise it will deteriorate			2
" if we do n't do the work , eventually we 'll lose what we 've got			0
