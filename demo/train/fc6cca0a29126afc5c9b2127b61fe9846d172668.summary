-- do you know the mascot for @entity3 ? can you come up with the all - time record for no. 16 seeds ? how about the starting backcourt for the @entity7 ? no ? well , to prepare you for @entity8 and the three weeks of @entity10 , here is an a to z primer on the @entity10 that will cap a wildly unpredictable season in college basketball			1
@entity15 is for anyone , which is pretty much who can claim the @entity10 title			1
that does n't mean you should pick @entity20 -- which brings a 15 - 20 record into the tournament -- in your office pool			1
but unlike one year ago , when @entity25 was heavily favored from the start of the season , there are a dozen teams that can legitimately say they have a chance to clip the nets in @entity32 in three weeks			1
@entity33 is for @entity34 , which is splitting into three directions next year			2
the seven @entity37 members are retaining the name and plan to add a few other top basketball schools			2
@entity41 and @entity42 are joining the @entity43 next season			2
and the remaining schools are combining with several newcomers to form a yet - to - be - named conference			2
will the league that gave us @entity50 and @entity52 's upset and the three @entity54 championships go out with one last hoorah ? as usual , it will have a lot of chances , with as many as eight members in the field of 68			2
@entity60 is for @entity61 , and if you 're looking for a reason to pick the @entity64 in your office pool , look no further than @entity66			2
the junior forward is the second leading scorer in the nation with 23.1 points a game			1
@entity71 is for @entity72 , which will be looking for its fifth national title under @entity75 coach @entity74 -- and might be favored to get it			2
the @entity77 went 27 - 4 despite missing center @entity78 for seven weeks			2
@entity78 scored a career - high 36 points in his return against @entity81 , the league 's regular season champion			0
if the @entity77 were good without him , imagine what they might do with him			0
@entity87 is for @entity88 , which is the mascot for a lot of teams , of course , including @entity10 newcomer @entity93			1
the @entity96 , @entity97 , school was established in 1991 and had its first classes in 1997			0
the @entity88 did n't make the full transition to @entity101 athletics until 2011 , in fact , so their arrival on the national stage this soon might be most surprising			1
@entity106 is for @entity107 , and that 's what the @entity109 in @entity110 stands for			0
@entity110 was known as the " @entity110 , " and the college that bears his name is back in the tournament for the second time after winning the @entity115 with a 26 - 3 record			0
@entity117 : @entity118 2013 predictions @entity120 is for @entity121 , the nickname for @entity123			1
they tend to fly under the radar in the @entity34 , but once again colorful head coach @entity126 had them tied for the regular - season title			0
it seems like a matter of time before he takes this program back to the @entity133			0
is this the year ? @entity134 is for @entity135 , and after ending a 65 - year @entity10 drought last season , the @entity136 is back in the field again			1
" i just feel like the basketball gods have been on our side , " @entity136 player @entity140 said , and @entity135 might need them : the @entity145 has a 31 - 59 record in the tournament since 1957			0
i is for @entity149 , and this year , the mighty @entity150 have stormed back on the national stage under head coach @entity152			0
they are the second in the nation in scoring at 80.8 points a game , led by sophomore forward @entity159 at 16.8 points and 8.1 rebounds			1
will that mean a @entity133 trip ? if so , it 'll end an a long drought for one of the most loyal fan bases in the sport : the @entity150 have just one @entity133 appearance ( 2002 ) in the past 20 years			0
@entity169 is for @entity170 , and while they do not normally inspire fear , if the matchup is right , they could make noise as a higher seed			1
@entity3 is in the tournament for the second straight year			0
@entity176 is for @entity177 , the defending national champs and most prominent bubble team in years			0
are the @entity179 in ? or are the @entity179 out ? unless they win the @entity180 this weekend , they 'll be sweating out the selection show in @entity182			1
( our guess : they 're in -- barely			0
) @entity186 is for @entity187 , that other national power in the @entity189			0
can the @entity190 keep the @entity10 title in - state ? they 're certainly on a roll			1
they entered the @entity196 with wins in 10 of their last 11 games , and that single loss was to @entity201 -- in five overtimes			1
@entity117 : projecting @entity203 that will make a @entity204 @entity205 is for @entity7 , and if you 're wondering why the @entity7 are back in contention for a national title , look no further than the backcourt			0
@entity210 is a national player of the year candidate averaging 19.2 points and 6.8 assists a game , while @entity214 adds 14.8 points and 4.7 rebounds			1
@entity217 is for @entity201 , and if you see the @entity218 in the tournament field , you 're probably going to wonder : what are they wearing ? @entity222 has provided several teams , including @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 , with outfits that the @entity228 described as " the wrong kind of crazy			1
" you 'll have to see for yourselves			0
just do n't stare for long			1
@entity231 is for @entity232 , and @entity41 is back in the field under head coach @entity234 , as usual			0
but how many more years will the 68 - year - old @entity234 , who won his 900th game , keep coaching ? " i never think about the next season until after the season , " he said at the @entity196 , " because during the season i want to quit every single game , even when we win			1
" @entity242 is for @entity243 , as in @entity244 forward @entity243 , the @entity246			0
@entity243 is one of the best stories in college basketball , a 6 ' 8 " forward from a small @entity250 town who had never stepped on an airplane before visiting the school 's @entity254 campus			0
can he lead the @entity244 their first title since 1984 ? @entity257 is for quixotic , which has been the quest for @entity259 to take its quintessential place as the q in the a to @entity263 come on , @entity264			0
get it done ! @entity266 is for @entity267 , the horned mascot for @entity269 , who will be making an appearance this tournament after all			0
it did n't look good for the perennial power @entity275 for much of the season , but a six - game winning streak late in the season should ensure that head coach @entity281 ' team is back in the field			1
@entity283 is for @entity284 , and if you 're an amateur bracketologist , you know that no no. 16 seed has ever won a game in the @entity10 since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985			1
is this the year of the upset to end all upsets ? " i think this is the year that a 16 could possibly beat a 1 for the first time , " @entity187 coach @entity289 said			2
before you make that pick in your office pool , remember : the 16s are 0 - 112 all - time in the tournament			0
@entity299 is for triple digits , and if you 're wondering how a @entity302 team that is 234th in scoring , 254th in rebounds , 253rd in assists and 240th in field - goal percentage made the tournament field , well , that 's march			2
the @entity308 got hot and won the @entity309			2
@entity310 is for @entity226 , which will be back in the field during the 75th anniversary of the @entity10			1
sports illustrated recently ranked the top 75 players in tournament history , and @entity316 1 and 2 belonged to the greatest dynasty in its history : @entity319 and @entity320			0
@entity321 is for @entity322 , a @entity323 of old that 's back in the tournament for the first time since 2004			0
the @entity326 are coached by @entity327 , who hit the remarkable buzzer - beater to stun @entity329 in the 1998 tournament			0
his father , @entity331 , was the coach that year , and his brother , @entity333 , coaches @entity334			0
@entity117 : breaking @entity335 to watch @entity336 is for @entity177 , back in the @entity10 field , and while its stay might not last long , its lovable amorphous mascot @entity338 will have a chance to make @entity343 montage that airs after the national title game			1
and that is where he belongs			0
@entity348 is for @entity349 , which is in danger of missing the @entity10 after reaching the field in 11 of the last 12 seasons			1
the @entity353 , who reached the @entity355 16 a year ago , are 17 - 13 this season in the @entity357 10			1
@entity358 is for @entity359 , and as usual , plenty of young stars are on the top teams			2
@entity363 was voted @entity365 freshman of the year for leading @entity366 back to the @entity10 after a two - year absence			1
@entity368 ( @entity226 ) and @entity369 ( @entity225 ) are two other talented rookies to watch this year			1
@entity371 is for @entity372 , the unofficial nickname of the @entity374 , and that wo n't be a typo in your bracket			2
once a plucky underdog , they are expected to be one of the no. 1 seeds when the field is revealed			1
will they prove the selection committee was right with a run to their first @entity133 ? that will be determined over the next three weeks			2
that 's what makes this tournament so much fun .			0

the @entity10 brackets will be revealed on selection *sunday* , march 17

@entity228 on @entity201 , @entity224 , @entity226 , @entity225 ' @entity222 *uniforms* : " wrong kind of crazy "
