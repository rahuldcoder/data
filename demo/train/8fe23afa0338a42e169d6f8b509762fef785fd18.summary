-- @entity1 is a bold and risky pick for vice president by @entity4			1
forget all the talk about the risk - averse @entity4 and his policy - free campaign			1
@entity4 just embraced a man whose deficit reduction plans are impressively specific -- and controversial			1
this is what a game - changer looks like @entity12			0
unlike many of his fellow @entity15 congressmen , @entity1 has not been content to just demagogue the deficit and debt			1
he 's had the courage to put specific plans on paper that would actually deal with the problem			2
and @entity4 now owns those plans , for better or for worse			2
it may be the first time in @entity26 history when a nominee has outsourced policy to his vp candidate			0
@entity1 's budget plan is serious and breathtaking in its scope			1
it seeks to take @entity15 rhetoric about reducing long - term deficits and debts and put it into specific policies			0
conservatives applaud the combination of vision and details in the plan , which would reset the government 's relationship with individuals on issues like @entity46 , moving toward privatization			0
@entity1 believes such changes are necessary to prevent @entity46 from becoming insolvent over the long term			2
but for all @entity1 's deficit hawk credentials , he did not vote for the bipartisan @entity52 plan , despite serving on the commission -- a serious disappointment			1
@entity55 : how @entity1 could help @entity4 liberals find the plans ideologically odious -- and therein lies the debate we 'll be having over the next three months			1
it makes this election a real choice between competing philosophies of government -- and that 's a healthy debate to have during a presidential election			0
on the politics of this pick , @entity1 does n't automatically bring a state into the @entity4 column , like @entity71 's @entity70 or @entity73 's @entity72 might have			1
@entity1 's home state of @entity75 has been trending safely for @entity76 , though the pick of the first district congressman will likely tighten that race			1
moreover , @entity1 is a lifelong politician , someone who embraced life on @entity81 at an early age			2
he was first elected to @entity83 in 1998 at the tender age of 28 , but he 'd already developed a reputation as a respected policy wonk , writing speeches for 1996 vp - nominee @entity88 and numerous congressmen			0
he has thought deeply about his political beliefs and has learned to explain them in ways that resonate with a swing district in a rust belt state			0
not incidentally , this is exactly the kind of voter that @entity4 will need to win over to win the presidency			2
this ticket will invigorate the @entity4 campaign among the base in terms of both style and substance			1
the @entity105 ticket represents generational change -- @entity1 , born in 1970 , is the first pure member of @entity107 to be on a national ticket			2
it is also the first presidential team to not have a @entity111 on the ticket -- @entity4 , of course , is @entity113 and @entity1 is catholic			1
it is another small sign of how our country continues to evolve			0
democrats are said to be " salivating " over this pick because it allows them to draft sharp contrasts on politically popular programs like @entity46 and @entity122			0
they believe that as the vp nominee , @entity1 makes this election a clear choice , rather than a referendum on president @entity76			2
this is the framing of the election they have long wanted			0
but @entity4 's surprising pick of @entity1 shows seriousness about governing and adds policy depth to his campaign			1
as a sign of the kind of president @entity4 might be , it is impressive and confident			0
and hopefully it will represent a decisive shift in this presidential election -- away from " attack and distract " and towards seriousness and substance			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

@entity148 : @entity4 's vp selection is a gamble that changes the campaign
he says @entity1 has very specific deficit reduction plans that @entity4 will have to back
@entity1 's focus on substance is a welcome change for a *largely* *negative* campaign , @entity148 says
