@entity0 , @entity1 -- for anyone who wants to make a serious play for the @entity6 vote -- and not just go through the motions -- here 's what you need to know : @entity11 are single - issue voters			1
or , as we say , respeto			0
if you want the votes of @entity11 , show some respect			0
or we 'll show you the door			0
i know what you 're thinking			0
what 's so special about this constituency ? three things : size , geography and unpredictability			2
in 2008 , about 10 million @entity11 voted ; the 2012 figure could be higher			0
@entity11 are well represented in " battleground " states ( i.e. @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 )			0
and , in the case of the @entity38 and @entity39 who make up about 66 % of the @entity42 @entity6 population , they 're in play because they have shown a willingness to vote for moderate @entity45 even though most are registered @entity46			1
polls show that @entity11 are just like other voters in that they care about education , jobs , the economy and health care			2
but their antennae go up when they see politicians using the immigration issue to scare up votes -- and , in the process , treating them like @entity60 atas			2
and while neither president @entity63 nor @entity64 has gone that far , there is still a problem			1
neither of these candidates seems to respect @entity11 , as evidenced by their cynical attempts to manipulate the immigration issue and take gimmicky shortcuts to get @entity6 support			1
this is why both are having trouble with @entity6 voters			1
" @entity77 " is defined differently for each candidate			0
in polls , @entity64 is having trouble getting as much as 30 % of the @entity6 vote			1
political observers note that a @entity45 presidential hopeful needs at least 35 % to win			0
@entity63 has more than twice that level of support but his problem is that there 's an enthusiasm gap and , if @entity11 do n't turn out for @entity63 , @entity64 will win			1
@entity64 took a wrong turn when he lurched to the right in the @entity45 primaries to pander to the nativist wing of the party			1
he portrayed illegal immigrants as takers and usurpers of public benefits and giveaways			1
he is well aware of the fact that illegal immigrants -- most of whom come from @entity99 countries -- are lured here by jobs offered by @entity42 employers			1
@entity64 should have learned this lesson when it came to his attention , during his stint as governor of @entity107 , that he had hired a landscaping company that employed illegal immigrants			1
@entity64 claimed that he did n't know the workers tending to his lawn were in the country illegally			1
nonetheless , the experience should have illustrated for him the law of supply and demand : without a demand for illegal immigrants , there would be no supply			1
@entity63 is not much better			1
raised in a black and white world , the president does n't know much about @entity11			0
and he has n't seemed all that interested in learning			0
our most important institution is the family			0
one good way to get on our bad side is to divide hundreds of thousands of families by deporting more than 1.2 million people in three years			2
and when you accomplish that feat by roping local police into the enforcement of immigration law through a program like @entity137 in ways that invite ethnic profiling , this is n't going to win you any friends among @entity11			2
finally , when you get caught in the act and these things come to light , it 's not a good idea to insist that most of the folks deported were criminals , when criminal activity has been cited as a reason for deportation in only 17 % of the cases last year			2
so far , in 2012 , that figure is down to 14 %			0
who makes up the rest ? it 's likely that the answer is gardeners , housekeepers and nannies who pose no threat to society			0
naturally , neither @entity64 nor @entity63 wants to talk about immigration			1
when @entity64 spoke to a @entity6 business group recently , he talked about education but did n't say a word about the @entity167 , which would give legal status to undocumented students who go to college or join the military			1
when administration officials recently invited a group of @entity177 bloggers to the @entity178 , the main topics of discussion were education and health while immigration was conspicuously left off the agenda			0
guess what ? @entity184 came up anyway , when the bloggers asked about it during the question and answer session			0
that 's the thing about immigration			2
unless it is dealt with head - on , it seeps into the discussion of other issues			0
it happened during the health care debate , when what consumed many conservatives was the question of whether illegal immigrants could access benefits under " @entity63 - care			1
" gentlemen , you can run but you ca n't hide			0
you have to talk about immigration			0
until you clear the air , admit what you 've done wrong , and try to make it right , you ca n't expect @entity11 to listen to what you have to say on any other subject -- or if they do , to believe what they hear			0
gov. @entity64 , stop pandering to racists and nativists in the @entity45 base by portraying illegal immigrants as takers ; acknowledge that the only thing that lures them here are jobs provided by @entity42 employers who need to be held accountable ; stop proposing simplistic solutions like saying that all illegal immigrants should " self - deport " ; and take up the cause of @entity99 businesses who ca n't find @entity42 workers to do jobs that immigrants wind up doing because parents are raising their kids to feel entitled to avoid hard work			1
president @entity63 , stop saying you do n't have the executive power to stop deportations when it has been established by a slew of legal experts , including nearly 100 law professors who recently sent a memo to the @entity178 , that you do			2
stop deportations of college - age students who would have been eligible for legal status under the @entity167 and the parents of @entity42 - born children ; stop portraying @entity45 as singlehandedly preventing immigration reform , and take your share of responsibility for not getting it done ; and propose to @entity242 a specific plan for comprehensive immigration reform			1
do all that , and we 'll be able to get past immigration and move onto other topics			0
but immigration comes first , because it lets us assess your character			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			2

@entity258 : among @entity6 voters , immigration is a test of candidates ' character
he says @entity64 pandered to *anti-immigrant* forces during the primaries
@entity258 says @entity63 's policy of deporting illegal immigrants has broken up families
he urges candidates to address need for immigration reform , then deal with other issues
