-- the slaughter of more than 130 children at a school by the @entity5 @entity4 on tuesday may prove as pivotal to @entity5 's national security policy as the 9/11 attacks were for the @entity8			1
for decades since its founding in 1947 , @entity5 has conceived of its neighbor @entity11 as its main enemy			1
indeed , the two countries have fought three major wars with each other as well as many smaller skirmishes			0
with tuesday 's attack , it is abundantly clear to all @entity5 that their main enemy is the internal enemy -- the @entity5 @entity4			1
this realization has been a long time coming , but it has finally come because the @entity4 have killed thousands of @entity5 soldiers , police and civilians over the past decade			2
and with tuesday 's attack the level of @entity5 outrage against the @entity4 is now at unprecedented levels			2
there is a widespread narrative in the @entity8 that the @entity5 government has not done enough to counter the @entity4			2
that narrative is out of date			0
in fact there has been a sea change in how , in particular , the @entity5 military regards the @entity4 , whom it once supported			1
in august 2012 , @entity37 , then the army chief general , gave a speech in @entity5 that did n't get much attention in the @entity40 , but it was a clear statement that the most important player in @entity5 's national security was reformulating @entity5 strategy from its overwhelmingly @entity11 - focus to the domestic threat posed by the @entity5 @entity4			1
@entity37 said , " we realize that the most difficult task for any army is to fight against its own people			0
... the fight against extremism and terrorism is our own war and we are right in fighting it			0
" this policy of taking the fight to the @entity5 @entity4 has been continued by the new army chief general , @entity55 , who visited the @entity8 last month , a trip that was notable for the warm reception he received in @entity59 and also at @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 , which manages the war in @entity64			2
this visit was all in stark contrast from three years ago when @entity5 - @entity8 relations were at their nadir following the raid in @entity70 , @entity5 , in which @entity71 was killed			0
the principal reason for the warming @entity8 - @entity5 relationship has been the large - scale operation that the @entity5 military launched beginning in june into the remote tribal region of @entity76 along the @entity64 - @entity5 border			1
@entity76 is the headquarters of the @entity5 @entity4 , the notorious @entity4 - affiliated @entity78 and remnants of @entity80			1
launching such an operation has long been a key demand of the @entity8 to the @entity5 military and government			2
according to the @entity5 military , during the past six months , it has killed more than 1,000 militants			1
among them was the death this month of @entity89 , a key leader of @entity80 who grew up in @entity90 and @entity62			0
from multiple sources in the @entity5 military and the @entity8 government i have heard that it was the @entity5 military , not the civilian government , that was pushing hard to conduct the @entity76 operation			1
earlier in the year , the civilian government , led by prime minister @entity98 , clung to the hope -- in reality , a delusion -- that some kind of a peace deal could be struck with the @entity5 @entity4			0
as tuesday 's despicable attack makes clear , the @entity5 @entity4 are not a bunch of @entity106 - in - waiting eager to make a deal , but rather are led by fanatical religious zealots willing to send half a dozen suicide attackers to kill scores of children			1
the history of negotiations with fanatical religious zealots is not an encouraging one			0
indeed , anyone with the most passing knowledge of previous " peace " deals with the @entity5 @entity4 would have understood the futility of trying to make a deal with them			0
the @entity5 government concluded peace deals with the @entity4 in 2004 , 2005 and 2008			0
all of the deals collapsed			0
today the @entity5 military understands that the @entity126 that it helped to create must now be killed			1
it will have the support of the vast majority of @entity5 to do so .			0

@entity130 : killing of more than 130 children at @entity5 school shocks a nation
he says it 's an indication of *irreparable* *breach* between @entity5 military and @entity4
@entity140 : military sees its main enemy as internal terrorists rather than historic foe @entity11
he says @entity5 military says it has killed more than 1,000 terrorists in @entity76
