-- all future singers of the national anthem should pay close attention to @entity5 's performance at game 2 of the @entity7 on october 24			1
if you 're going to make a mistake , this is the way to make it			0
on thursday , the musician was at @entity12 in @entity13 to lead the stadium in a rendition of " @entity16			2
" but when he opened his mouth to sing , the words of " @entity18 " started pouring out			0
rather than " oh , say can you see , " @entity5 kicked off the song with , " oh , beautiful ... " but the singer quickly -- and rather smoothly -- recovered , going straight into the correct lyrics without missing a beat			1
while other singers have caught major flak for messing up the words to the national anthem at such events , @entity5 did have an excuse : he was also performing " @entity18 " that same night during the seventh inning stretch			2
he was joined by several survivos of april 's @entity34 attack .			0

@entity5 messed up his national anthem performance
he began singing " @entity18 " instead of " @entity16 "
the singer quickly and smoothly recovered
