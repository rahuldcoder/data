-- if you ask a class of aspiring managers in a business school for the purpose of the corporation , you get a remarkably rapid response			1
the purpose of the corporation , they will tell you , is to maximize shareholder value			1
but like any simple answer , it is not only wrong , it is also profoundly damaging			2
to paraphrase @entity15 , the legendary ex-ceo of @entity16 , the idea that purpose of the corporation is to maximize shareholder value is " the dumbest idea in the world			1
" corporations with a strict focus on maximizing shareholder value tend to employ a cadre of generalist managers who have relatively short - term commitment to the firm			1
because their compensation and future prospects are directly tied to share price , executives spend much of their time courting financial analysts			1
ceos will often go to any lengths to keep this relatively small audience happy			2
this means announcing all manner of initiatives which will boost the share price -- including mergers and acquisitions , restructuring , and downsizing			1
usually these initiatives look good on paper , and therefore deliver a rapid boost to the company 's share price			0
however , actually delivering the value these initiatives promise is much more tricky			0
the result is that up to 80 % of these initiatives fail to deliver on their promises			0
meanwhile , the executives who started them years earlier have banked their bonus , sold their share options and moved on , often to start similar restructuring initiatives at another company			1
the people left behind -- such as longer term shareholders and employees -- are left to pick up the pieces			1
many large corporations are remarkably resilient			1
the people working for them are often able to get over failed initiative and get back to delivering the results which matter			0
but this resilience can be rapidly eroded if the company -- driven by a relentless search for shareholder value -- goes through rounds of appointing heroic new ceos who implement promising initiatives , create temporary share price boosts , then deliver disappointing or disastrous long - term results			1
when this happens repeatedly , a corporation can easily go into a death spiral			0
employees become bitter and cynical			2
the best leave , while the worst stick around			0
the quality of products and services suffer , and customers become dissatisfied			2
the company diverts resources from innovation into providing immediate returns to shareholders			0
this can mean the company gets quickly overtaken by competitors			0
over time , analysts begin to sniff the creeping signs of corporate decline and begin making more sell recommendations than buy ones			0
the result is that the share price begins to decline			0
ever more change and turnaround efforts seem to add fuel to the fire			0
eventually the firm goes out of business , or is taken over			0
there are many groups who lose from this process			0
employees lose jobs , customers lose loved products and services , suppliers lose value customers , governments lose tax revenues and investors lose the value of their investment portfolio			1
one group who gains from this are the senior executives who keep moving between companies to get away from impending disasters and increase their pay packet			2
the other group are many professionals who skim the transaction costs off the multiple restructuring efforts , change initiatives and other activities designed to increase shareholder value			2
pulling companies out of these death spirals is notoriously difficult , and senior executives ' responses can make matters worse			2
they usually launch flashy initiatives designed to appeal to the markets , which ultimately fail to deliver value in the long term			2
but one of the biggest steps which we can take to avoid the fate of companies like the banks or @entity155 is to drop the myopic focus on maximizing shareholder value			1
instead , it is vital we recognize corporations have multiple goals -- such as creating fulfilling jobs , building up industry , satisfying consumers and delivering returns to shareholders			1
the task of senior business leaders should be about balancing these multiple goals			0
to ensure corporations drop their shareholder value myopia , there are some immediate practical steps that can be taken			1
corporate boards might include a range of representatives which goes beyond just shareholders			0
they might include employee , customer and community representatives			0
corporations should report not just their financial performance to shareholders , but also how they perform along other important metrics such as customer satisfaction , social and environmental benefits			2
executives should be measured and incentivized on a number of different dimensions -- only one of which would be shareholder value			1
the corporation itself needs to take active steps to repudiate a broad culture where share price is the only thing which matters			0
questions such as how this impacts on customers , suppliers , communities and employees all need to be equally valid topics of discussion in the new corporation			1
the most damaging practices designed to boost shareholder value in the short term , such as share buyback schemes , could be banned			1
these measures are likely to create an environment where plans are rigorously tested against different criteria before they are hastily rolled out			0
