@entity0 -- with time running out for @entity5 to prevent a doubling of interest rates on federal student loans , the @entity2 and @entity4 leaders exchanged accusations thursday on who was to blame for the lack of an agreement			1
president @entity13 chided @entity4 for holding up a deal with unreasonable demands , and he urged college students to continue raising their voices on the issue			0
however , spokesmen for @entity4 leaders in the @entity2 and @entity21 denied an assertion by press secretary @entity23 that the @entity2 has been working with them to try to reach a deal			0
asked about @entity4 complaints that the @entity2 has not reached out to @entity4 on the issue in recent days , @entity23 said that " we are actively working with members of @entity5 to get this done , " adding , " in both parties			1
" spokesmen for @entity2 speaker @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity21 minority leader @entity33 , @entity34 , disputed @entity23 's account			0
on the @entity21 floor , @entity36 accused @entity13 and @entity38 of playing political games on the issue			1
" it is the @entity42 - led @entity21 that has failed to act and the president who has failed to contribute to a solution , and the reason is obvious , " @entity36 said			1
" it was reported yesterday that the @entity47 is launching a website with a student loan countdown clock aimed at raising money off this issue			0
the implication is that @entity4 are the ones dragging their feet			0
" the only reason the issue remains unresolved " is that the president wants to keep it alive , " @entity36 said , adding that " he thinks it benefits him politically for college students to believe we 're the problem			1
" despite such political back - and - forth , senate majority leader @entity64 , @entity65 , said that " a series of meetings over the last 48 hours " with @entity4 had raised hopes for a deal			1
" at this stage , it appears that they are compromising , just as we are , and hope we can get something done , " @entity64 said			2
leaders of both parties insist that they want to keep the federally backed rate at 3.4 % for another year , but they sharply disagree over how to pay the $ 6 billion cost			1
@entity38 want to eliminate certain tax benefits for small - business owners , while @entity4 want to cut a preventive - care fund created in 2010 as part of @entity13 's health care reform law			2
the @entity4 - majority @entity2 has passed its version of the measure , which @entity13 has threatened to veto			0
the @entity21 continues to negotiate an alternative version			0
if @entity5 fails to act by july 1 , the rate jumps to 6.8 % , with an average cost to students of $ 1,000 in increased loan debt , according to the @entity2			1
in his remarks at the @entity2 to students campaigning for an extension of the current rate , @entity13 blamed republicans for preventing a deal			2
" last month , democrats in the @entity21 put forward a plan that would have kept these rates in place without adding a dime to the deficit			0
unfortunately , @entity21 @entity4 got together and blocked it , " @entity13 said			0
" over in the @entity2 , the @entity4 said they 'd keep these rates down only if we agreed to cut things like preventative health care for women , which obviously would n't fix the problem but would create a new problem , " the president continued			2
he also poked fun at an unidentified congressman , presumably @entity4 , who @entity13 said had warned that the student loan rate issue was about giving students " free college education			2
" that complaint " does n't make much sense , because the definition of a loan is , it 's not free ; you have to pay it back , " @entity13 said			0
while @entity13 has repeatedly raised the issue in campaign appearances , certain @entity4 presidential nominee @entity122 has also said @entity5 should act to keep the rate at 3.4 %			1
in 2007 , lawmakers temporarily cut the rate for undergraduates taking out federal @entity130 loans up to the 2011 school year			0
the lower rates were phased in , so students have been able to access the lowest 3.4 % rate on subsidized federal loans for only one school year			1
the 2007 law allows interest rates to revert back to 6.8 % for the 2012 - 13 school year , which starts in july			1
@entity1 's @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
