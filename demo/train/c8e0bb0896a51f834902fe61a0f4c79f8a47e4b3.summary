-- two @entity2 prison inmates who authorities say directed members of their respective groups -- a street gang and a transnational organized crime syndicate -- to help them steal $ 8 million from people 's bank accounts were sentenced wednesday to 25 years in prison			1
@entity12 , 36 , and @entity13 , 33 , were convicted of leading the ring from @entity2 's @entity15 , where they were cellmates in 2009 , assistant u.s. attorney @entity11 said			1
the case was one of two major federal indictments targeting the transnational @entity22 crime group , to which @entity23 belongs and which allegedly has ties to high - level crime figures in @entity26 and elsewhere , authorities said			1
" ( @entity12 and @entity23 ) basically combined their skills to execute the bank fraud , " @entity11 said			2
@entity12 , a street gang member , and @entity32 directed non-imprisoned members of their groups to execute the scheme , in which they 'd bribe bank insiders to get people 's bank account and personal information , authorities said			1
the pair 's associates would make out high - dollar checks from those accounts , forge the victims ' signatures and then deposit the checks into accounts the conspirators established , prosecutors said			1
more than 500 victims in multiple states were targeted for a total of more than $ 8 million , @entity11 said			1
the conspirators mostly targeted older people , believing them to be less " proficient in checking up on their accounts via the @entity59 , " prosecutors said in court documents			1
@entity12 and @entity23 had been nearing the end of their prison sentences			0
@entity12 was serving time for identity theft , and @entity23 was in prison for shooting at an occupied vehicle and carrying a concealed weapon , authorities said			2
" the goal ultimately was once those checks were deposited from the bank accounts , their associates on the outside would obtain the cash and split up the proceeds , " @entity11 said			1
@entity23 , of @entity76 , @entity2 , was convicted in march of bank fraud conspiracy , bank fraud and aggravated bank fraud			2
@entity12 pleaded guilty in december to conspiracy to commit bank fraud conspiracy , bank fraud and aggravated identity theft			2
@entity23 's attorney , @entity83 , said wednesday that his client was addicted to heroin at the time , and that the addiction clouded his judgment			0
" if feel bad for him and his family			0
it was a case where he was using drugs at the time , and he was n't thinking clearly , " said @entity83 , who added he intends to appeal his client 's sentence			2
@entity83 contends that @entity23 was involved for only a portion of the scheme 's time line , and that no loss of money is directly attributable to @entity23			0
@entity12 's attorney , @entity100 , said he 'd also appeal the sentence , arguing that it was too long			0
" in @entity2 , first - degree murder is 25 years to life in prison			0
this is bank fraud case , no violence , and here he is getting 25 years , the same ( you can get ) for murder , " @entity100 said			1
" something seems counterintuitive about that			0
" @entity23 is one of 70 defendants named in a racketeering indictment -- the second major case targeting @entity22 , authorities said			1
most have pleaded guilty , but the rest -- @entity23 and 32 others -- are awaiting trial , @entity11 said			0
both indictments were unsealed in february 2011			0
members of @entity22 have a heritage going back to @entity26 and other @entity126 countries , and the crime group started as a street gang in @entity129 , @entity2 , in the 1980s , authorities said			1
members identify themselves with tattoos , graffiti and gang clothing , but the organization is more concerned with racketeering than controlling " turf , " authorities have said			0
@entity11 said the two indictments have significantly disrupted the group			0
@entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this story .			0
