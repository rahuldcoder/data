-- a just - released report from the @entity2 and @entity3 is making news by clearly illustrating that @entity5 have " shorter lives and poorer health			1
" this is somewhat shocking , given how much we spend on health care each year â € ” more than any of the 16 other rich countries surveyed in the study			1
what 's even more upsetting is that this report focused quite heavily on people who are young			2
in the @entity5 , even that group fared poorly			2
why is this ? some of the reasons involve choices make at a personal level			1
we eat too much , abuse drugs too often , wear seat belts too rarely and commit violence against each other to often			0
systemic issues are also to blame			0
we have higher levels of poverty than comparable countries , and our safety net programs are less capable of catching people when they fall			2
and too many also have too much trouble accessing the health care system , resulting in inefficient , ineffective and often absent care			1
it 's far too easy to let these dreadful statistics become obscured in a politically charged argument			0
this report is so stark that it 's going to take a concerted effort on the part of the government , the media , the health care system and everyday citizens to turn things around			1
our personal choices are bad			1
our safety nets are bad			0
our health care system is bad			1
how bad ? when compared with peer countries , the @entity5 was the absolute worst with respect to still births , infant mortality and low birth weight			1
some have tried to blame this on " coding " differences			0
in other words , they will claim that other countries will refuse to define a premature birth as we do , resulting in artificially high numbers in the @entity5			1
but when this report recalculated the rates to exclude such births equally in all countries , we still ranked last			0
things do n't get better after birth			0
the chance that a child in the @entity5 will die before age 5 is higher than in any of the other 16 peer countries			1
injuries are the most common cause of death , but the @entity5 also has the highest rate of deaths caused by negligence or abuse			2
and violence is decidedly an @entity5 problem			1
homicide is the third most common cause of death in children age 1 - 4			0
from age 5 - 19 , the trend continues			0
kids this age in the @entity5 have the worst health ranking of the 17 studied countries			1
more than one - third of @entity5 children age 5 - 17 are obese or overweight , the highest of any peer country			1
the adolescent pregnancy rate in the @entity5 is about 3.5 times the average of others			2
additionally , the rates of sexually transmitted infections , including syphilis , gonorrhea and chlamydia are the worst compared to peer countries			2
nor are these children exempt from death			0
injury deaths are more common in 15 - to 19 - year - olds in the @entity5 than in any other studied country			1
homicide claims the second highest number of lives in 15 - to -24 - year - olds , and 4 in 5 of those deaths involve guns			0
males between the ages of 15 and 19 are five times as likely to die from violence in the @entity5 than in other countries			1
even as young adults , ages 25 - 34 , mortality remains consistently upsetting and preventable			0
unintentional injuries remain the no. 1 cause of death			0
the risk of dying by violence remains seven times higher for males in the @entity5 ages 20 - 24 than in other countries			1
we have to work together to make these numbers better			0
some of them can be improved with public health measures			1
we need to help @entity5 be less obese , to have fewer accidents and to commit less violence			1
there are lots of local studies and initiatives that propose ways to fix these things , but our public health system is woefully underfunded , and translating any promising findings to meaningful societal change poses a huge challenge			1
we also need to improve our safety nets to help children at the lowest end of the socioeconomic ladder do better , even before they are born			0
pregnant women , babies and children suffer from hunger and malnutrition far too often in the richest country in the world			1
yet we still debate the merits of the federally funded @entity156 ( @entity157 , @entity158 ) program , school lunches and food assistance to needy families			0
finally , we need to find a way to improve access to the health care system			1
the medicaid program covers one in every three births and one in every three children in the @entity5 , and it 's still not enough			2
as some states balk at expanding @entity172 to cover many of the poorest uninsured , some are still talking about reducing funding to the already stretched program			0
there 's no question that we have the capability , the knowledge and the resources to care for people			2
it 's just a matter of doing it better			0
there will be some who deny these results			0
others will try to use them for political gain			0
that would be a mistake			0
we have to accept these findings and begin to work holistically to improve them			0
being last just is n't the @entity5 way			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity198 : new study shows @entity5 health and *lifespan* worst of 17 rich countries
he says it 's because of personal choices , systemic woes . poverty high , health care *uneven*
he says this particularly affects youth , *plagued* by *sickness* , violence , high mortality
@entity198 : do n't make it political . the richest country in the world must improve public health
