that 's how witnesses described feeling after three people slipped into the foamy waters of the @entity5 , in the middle of a @entity8 park			1
the youngest of three -- a 6 - year - old boy -- was able to escape the frigid waters alive			1
but the other two people -- one of them his sister -- who went after him did not survive			1
" these people literally jumped in without thinking of their own safety and trying to rescue that child , " @entity8 fire chief @entity14 said			1
the drama unfolded thursday evening amidst the 123 acres of @entity19 , which is named -- like the city of @entity8 itself -- for the series of picturesque @entity5 waterfalls that run through it			1
according to @entity8 police chief @entity24 , the boy had gone into the several - feet - high foam often generated there by the river , and perhaps into the water itself			1
his sister , who @entity24 identified as 16 - year - old @entity33 , at one point went in after him and ended up falling into the surging water			1
a bystander , 28 - year - old @entity36 , then went into the river trying to help , said the police chief			1
he , too , was sucked in -- but not before others at the scene did what they could to save him			2
one of those who tried was @entity43			0
his shirt muddy , he told @entity0 affiliate ksfy on thursday how he and two others had grabbed hold of the man who 'd fallen into the river			2
" we had him ... but he just slipped , " @entity43 said			0
" i heard him say , ' hold onto me , i 'll hold onto you			0
' that was the last i heard his voice			0
" @entity57 shared @entity43 's sense of helplessness about not being able to do more			0
" @entity63 , i felt hopeless , " @entity57 , who watched the scene unfold from a nearby bridge , told ksfy			0
" i wish there was something i could have done			0
" authorities from various agencies converged on the scene , their task of finding the two people complicated by zero visibility in the cold , fast - moving , debris - filled waters			1
heavy machinery was brought in to break up and remove ice from the river , so that boats and divers could get in , @entity14 explained			0
new water heading into the river was shut off thursday night , slowing down its flow , but the task nonetheless remained difficult			0
" everybody here is essentially eyes on the water , " said the fire chief			1
" we 're looking for something maybe as small as a knee , a patch of clothing			0
" during the day friday , the rescuers found the body of the rescued boy 's sister			1
@entity14 said he talked with her father afterward			0
" they are all in a state of shock , " the fire chief said			1
" our prayers are with them , and we 're just trying to help them cope as best we can			0
" that left authorities with one more person to find			2
while there 's a limited area as to where he may be , that does n't necessarily mean his body will be easy to spot			2
" it 's still going to be an issue of where we 're going to find him , " @entity14 said			2
water safety expert : ' drowning does n't just happen '			2
