-- mention @entity1 , @entity4 's largest country , and what comes to mind ? probably conflict minerals , proxy wars , the rape capital of the world , or the trigger for the 19th century " @entity12			1
" but beyond the despair , there is another country ; a country not like any other country in the world -- a country with rich ancient traditions , a colorful cultural energy and creativity , amazing potential and much , much more			0
read this : @entity4 's new skyscraper megacities ask historians or archaeologists -- one of the earliest known mathematical objects , the @entity26 bone , was not made in @entity31 , @entity32 or @entity33 but around @entity1 's @entity34 around 18,000 bc. it is certainly difficult to picture this today : thirty - two years of dictatorship followed by wars , invasions and bad governance reduced @entity1 from being a potential economic powerhouse to one of the world 's poorest countries			1
but little by little , individuals and organizations in and outside @entity1 are creating glimmers of hope			2
the future of @entity1 still looks more exciting than its past and with a bit more push we can tilt the balance and awaken the world to a century , if not centuries , of " made in @entity4			2
" below are six reasons why saving the @entity1 is critical			2
@entity1 's strategic position in the continent @entity1 's unique geo - strategic position , more than its gold , diamonds and coltan reserves , makes it of interest to anyone with a keen eye for @entity4 's future			1
neighboring nine other countries at all four cardinal points , @entity1 sits right at the crossroads of @entity71 democratization and development , as well as the intersection of a series of real and potential security dilemmas			2
this means whatever happens in @entity1 could have an impact across the continent			1
and a stable and functioning @entity1 could trigger prosperity and development throughout @entity4 , and most critically , play a role in assuring security in the @entity84 and elsewhere in the continent			1
helping to make famine in @entity4 history @entity1 's vast , fertile agricultural land has tremendous potential to make it the breadbasket for the entire @entity71 continent			1
if @entity1 's fertile land were used effectively it could lift millions out of extreme poverty in a continent where malnutrition and food insecurity are rife			1
but this potential has barely been tapped			0
in spite of climatic conditions favorable for farming and abundant water resources , only a small proportion of @entity1 's arable land and pasture lands is under cultivation			1
bad governance and decay of the transportation infrastructure -- in particular the road networks through which production could be distributed around the country -- continue to prove a challenge and the consequences have not been short of a disaster			0
the @entity114 lists @entity1 as the world 's hungriest country in its 2009 , 2010 and 2011 reports , and @entity118 says @entity1 has the highest rate of malnutrition in @entity121 and @entity122 , affecting 43 % of children under five			1
@entity124 the @entity126 rainforest , one of the natural wonders of the world , is sometimes described as one of the @entity132 's lungs -- the other being @entity135 's @entity134			2
home to 10,000 species of plants ( of which 3,000 are found nowhere else ) , it features mesmerizing scenery , restless landscapes , waterfalls , a mosaic of savannahs , swamp forests and some of the most spectacular and endangered wildlife in the world			0
the forest plays a crucial role in regulating climate , both locally and globally , but recent industrial logging , resource extraction and proxy wars are threatening this fragile ecosystem			0
as things stand , there are 20 million hectares of logging titles in @entity1 -- an area the size of @entity160			0
for more than half of @entity1 's population who rely on the forest for food , medicine , fresh water , shelter and customary tradition , this is humanitarian havoc in slow motion			1
for the global climate , it could be a catastrophe			0

@entity180 in aquatic biodiversity and holding more than half of @entity4 's water reserves , including four of the continent 's great lakes , as well as @entity4 's longest and deepest freshwater lake -- @entity187 -- @entity1 's lakes and rivers , if coupled with the needed infrastructure to fulfill its potential , could be a breadbasket for the region			1
with more than 700 species of fish recorded in the @entity126 -- the world 's second - largest river basin -- the potential for commercial fishing in these lakes and rivers is great			0
however , the ripple of potential does not stop there ; tourism is another side of the coin			0
@entity1 's lakes and rivers , along with its rolling lush hills and valleys , could potentially transform @entity1 into a huge tourist attraction , creating jobs and businesses for the region			1
lighting up @entity4 , from @entity215 electricity is said to be the lifeblood of human society and economic development , but 550 million @entity71 have no access to electricity			0
they rely on wood , dung and crop waste for their daily energy needs -- and that costs lives			0
burning dirty fuels in poorly ventilated homes causes 1.6 million people around the world to die prematurely each year			0
yet , astonishingly , the @entity233 has the potential to light up the entire @entity71 continent from @entity215 , without further polluting the planet or worsening climate change			0
wildlife @entity1 's unspoiled wildlife diversity is perhaps the country 's most fascinating feature			1
whether by 4x4 drives or river tours by pirogue , @entity1 offers an ideal wildlife destination for nature lovers			2
home to big cats as well as 1,000 bird species , 900 species of butterflies , 400 species of mammals ( including more than 80 % of @entity71 primates ) , half of the continent 's remaining elephants , 280 species of reptiles , 216 species of amphibians , forest antelopes and forest pigs -- with more species being discovered -- the @entity126 is by any measure an essential feature of a healthy planet			0
but instability , industrial logging and poaching are threatening the very existence of some of these animals , including some of the country 's most famous residents such as the shy , endangered okapi , the owl - faced monkey , the beautifully patterned bongo , the sliverback gorilla , the bonobo and the dazzling @entity1 peacock			1
nonetheless , it 's not too late to save these species			0
and it 's not too late to save the @entity1 , and help it realize the potential it has always had			2

@entity1 has a reputation for conflict and *violence*
*campaigner* and @entity1 native @entity294 says there 's another side to the country
it has immense natural beauty thanks to its rainforests and wildlife
the country 's *farmland* and rivers could help feed the continent , he says
