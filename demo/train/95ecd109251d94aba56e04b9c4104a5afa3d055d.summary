-- i ran my eighth @entity2 on monday , the day the bombs went off			1
we can not let this terrible tragedy taint this amazing international event or let whoever was behind this evil act win			1
that 's why i will run it again			2
marathoners are tough - minded and can endure discomfort for long periods of time			2
they enjoy running to push themselves and often run with others and make friends along the way			2
some are highly competitive , like me , and enjoy the long , hard journey to get into marathon shape before the race			1
after all that training , the @entity2 is usually a very happy day that results in a joyous sense of accomplishment			1
but today , most runners are probably feeling as i do : disgusted , saddened , angry and depressed			0
the race feels surreal , almost as if it did n't happen , and as if a whole lot of training and hard work amounted to nothing			1
i do n't think one participant can walk away from that marathon and feel glad			1
most people say they want to forget it because of all the sadness and loss			0
on the day of the marathon , i had set out to @entity40 , @entity41 , where the race begins , to start in the elite women 's field , which begins 30 minutes ahead of the remaining waves			1
as i was standing on the starting line and looking at the thousands of people around me , i was struck by a terrible and unusual thought : " today 's venue would be an opportune time for someone to hurt a lot of people			0
" it passed , the gun went off , and i was on my way to @entity56			1
this was an especially exciting year because it was the first time my three children , who are 13 , 11 and 10 , came to watch mommy run the @entity56 race			1
as i concluded the race , the second master 's finisher and 20th woman overall , i was immediately escorted back to the @entity65 where my family and i were staying			0
we were sitting around discussing the race , and the first explosion went off			0
we all looked at each other wondering what that could have been -- with a gut - wrenching feeling , we realized it had to be bad			0
sirens were wailing , and the streets were full of commotion			0
panicky texts were coming in fast from family and friends , asking if we were all safe , sending information about the two bombs that went off at the finish line			0
our tv was turned off : someone had told me to keep it off to spare the kids the gory details			0
the hotel went into lockdown for the next five hours , and our fear grew			0
we could n't help but think of all the people involved , the people who were killed and injured , their families , the volunteers , the first responders , the medical personnel and the runners			1
we wondered how race director @entity95 was doing			0
he has the respect of the whole running community for all he has done to make the @entity2 so special and memorable for everyone involved			2
my kids keep saying , " what kind of an idiot would do something like this ? who would do this ? what do you think they are feeling about what they did right now ? are you scared to run the @entity2 again , @entity111 ? " runners will continue to participate in the @entity2 -- but it may take years for the fear to go away completely			1
i love running this marathon and will continue to do it			0
but next time i run down @entity117 to the finish line , i will think of all the people injured and the ones who lost their lives for nothing			2
and i think my children have seen their mom run the @entity2 for the first and last time			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity128			2

@entity128 , a pro runner , ran the @entity2 on monday for her eighth time
@entity132 says we ca n't let this tragedy taint the marathon or let whoever did it win
@entity132 feels no sense of accomplishment ; she says most runners want to forget race
@entity132 will run the @entity56 race again but will always remember what happened
