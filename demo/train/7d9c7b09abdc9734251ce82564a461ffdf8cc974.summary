@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 does n't know if he 's a legend			1
@entity3 attends the " @entity5 " premiere this month with actors @entity6 , left , and @entity8			1
" maybe , what is it ? " he asks , before making a reference to a line from director @entity13 's " @entity14 , " " when the legend becomes fact , print the legend			1
" but for more than 50 years , he 's appeared on the screen and behind the camera			1
his film credits include " @entity21 , " " @entity23 " and the three " @entity24 " westerns			2
he owns four @entity25 -- two for direction of " @entity27 " and " @entity28 " and best picture wins for those two films -- and he 's been nominated for six others			2
his most recent contribution to the film world is " @entity5			1
" in the film , which @entity3 also directed , he stars as @entity35 , a @entity36 veteran who is forced by immigrant neighbors to challenge his prejudices			1
@entity35 is a recognizable type , the gruff , sometimes bigoted old man who may be hiding more heart than he lets on			1
even though he 's not too caring at the start , " he ends up expressing love to a family he 's never known before , " @entity3 said			1
@entity2 talked with @entity3 , 78 , about the movie , his future as an actor and what he expects in terms of awards			1
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity2 : when you read the script , were you at all concerned about the nature of the language ? @entity3 : no , i was n't			1
if you 're going to learn something and progress in the movie as a character , you have to start as something else in order to learn tolerance			1
and your character obviously is never too old to learn that , so he has to be a certain way			2
but i -- being politically incorrect -- i find [ it ] fascinating because i hate the so - called @entity72 thing			1
i think that 's one of the things that 's damaging our generation at the present time			2
everybody is taking themselves and everything so seriously			2
if they just relax a little more and take themselves and everything else a little less seriously , they 'd have a lot more fun			2
@entity2 : i understand @entity87 [ @entity88 ] was the original screenplay writer			2
boy , did he get a grand slam , getting @entity3 to sign onto his project			1
@entity3 : well , it was interesting because he had a hard time getting it to us for some reason			1
anyway , they did and finally they got it to @entity100 , who 's my associate			2
and he read it and said , " well , it 's kind of interesting			2
you might find this character interesting			2
" he says , " he 's got a lot of -- he 's kind of a racist -- he 's a little bit of a lot of things			2
" i said , " well , it sounds interesting , i 'll read it			0
" you know , he said the same thing you 're saying			0
he said , " it 's not exactly politically correct			0
" i said , " perfect			0
i 'll read it tonight			0
" @entity2 : it 's great that after doing so many films in your long career , you 're still looking for that edgy material			0
the material that 's not quite in the box obviously			0
and i heard that you do n't know if you 'll be doing too much acting anymore ? @entity3 : i do n't think so			1
i just do n't think there 's going to be that many good roles , or as you say , edgy material			0
@entity2 : maybe not edgy material for the typical senior that 's an actor , but you 're a legend			1
so i 'm thinking people are writing stuff for you			1
@entity3 : i 'll tell you why			1
it 's that i do enjoy being behind the camera			1
i started directing 38 years ago in order to be involved in the whole project and not just the one component of acting			0
and so it became interesting to me to look at the whole picture			0
and so i 'm enjoying it back there			0
and next picture i do , @entity149 [ @entity150 ] 's going to be upfront and i 'm going to be behind the camera			2
and that 's where , i think , where i belong			0
@entity2 : and you guys are shooting that film [ about @entity159 ] in @entity160 ? @entity3 : yeah			1
@entity2 : you guys are buddies now			0
@entity3 : well , this will be our third together film over the years			1
the other two films [ " @entity27 " and " @entity28 " ] seem to be reasonably successful , so we just hope we can keep a trend			0
@entity2 : you 've got " @entity167 , " and then you 've got " @entity5			1
" both of them are getting a lot of buzz			0
what 's your reaction to the fact that you 'll probably be getting a lot of [ award ] nominations ? @entity3 : oh , i do n't know about that			1
i do n't think about that			0
i just make the pictures and where they fall is where they fall			0
if somebody likes them , that 's always nice			0
and if they do n't like them , then too bad			0
it 's just you -- you just make this picture			0
actually , i kind of make a film for myself to sort of express myself			2
or it 's a story i might want to follow			0
i never think too much about anybody seeing it			0
and then when you 're done with it , you go , " @entity200			0
now we got to see if anybody wants to see this thing			0
" so we 're at that period right now , at least on " @entity5			1
