here is a roundup of some of the movement 's recent developments			2
@entity14 police in @entity14 arrested three protesters sunday , a day after 17 demonstrators were hauled off to jail			1
tensions are high between the two groups , with each side blaming the other for scuffles			2
protesters became upset sunday when police began removing a food table from a park , some of them surrounding a police car			1
one woman then pushed a @entity14 police officer , according to a police statement			1
one officer twisted his knee , while another was treated and released from an area hospital after being hit in the head , police said			1
on saturday night , police in riot gear arrested 17 people as they cleared furniture and tents from an occupy encampment near the city 's civic center , police spokesman @entity40 said			1
the main issue , he said , was that the items were blocking a right of way			1
" people are welcome to come back and protest , but we do n't want them to do it in a way that 's not safe , " @entity40 said			2
occupy @entity14 has accused the police of brutality , saying officers have threatened to " break the teeth " of protesters			1
it said police followed protesters even after they left the park , and assaulted demonstrators who stood on the sidelines			1
" these are certainly the kind of actions one might expect from the @entity72 police in the last days of the @entity73 , but not in @entity14 , " the group said			1
@entity74 as president @entity76 , first lady @entity77 and the heads of 18 other nations dined together saturday night , they were unwittingly serenaded for almost 45 minutes by a musician playing a song about the @entity82			1
" we occupy the streets , we 'll occupy the courts , we 'll occupy the offices of you , till you do the bidding of the many , not the few , " sang @entity83 , a well - known local guitarist who calls himself @entity84 , the @entity86 word that means " the gift			2
" @entity84 was invited by the @entity95 to perform during the @entity98 leaders ' dinner			1
dressed in a suit , @entity84 at first played traditional @entity86 - style music as leaders arrived at @entity74 's @entity102			2
eventually he unbuttoned his shirt to reveal a t - shirt that said , in handwritten letters , " occupy with @entity106 , " and began playing a song he recently wrote , " we are the many			2
" @entity110 recorded on a cell phone by @entity84 's sound technician showed some leaders turning their attention toward him as he sang , but most appeared not to notice			1
" i started out very cautiously because my intention was not to disrupt their dinner			1
my intention was to subliminally convey a message that i felt was paramount to the negotiations , " @entity84 told @entity0			0
@entity4 dozens of doctors and nurses descended on @entity4 's @entity123 on sunday to administer free flu shots to ward off the risk of a sweeping infection in the close quarters			1
some of the medics held up a sign that read , " i 'm a doctor for the 99 % " others made their way through the park , publicizing their drive and reminding the gathered they did n't have to be a part of the protests to receive the shots			1
before the event , the non-profit @entity138 had asked for 99 doctors , nurses and students to administer the doses			1
@entity145 told @entity0 's @entity146 that some protesters initially were hesitant to receive the shot			0
" one man said he would do it but was n't sure if it was some time of secret government experiment , " @entity145 said			0
" he eventually took the shot and walk away happy			0
" @entity154 , also speaking to @entity0 's @entity146 , said the presence of the doctors " means we have their support , support from all different sectors			1
" " all of the doctors there , it was just enough to make an old man get a little watery - eyed , " @entity154 , 68 , said			1
@entity165 , @entity166 @entity165 police issued a third notice for demonstrators to vacate city parks on saturday , police spokeswoman officer @entity167 told @entity0			1

numerous reports of thefts and assaults in the encampment have been made , and 15 emergency medical runs were made between october 6 and november 11 , he said			0
" misconduct is not about free speech , " the mayor said , " and the behavior we 're now seeing is running squarely into the needs of our city government that also represents the 99 %			1
as mayor of the city of @entity185 , i represent the 99 % also			2
" @entity230 , @entity231 police in @entity230 , @entity231 , made more than 50 arrests sunday as they cleared two parks -- @entity235 and @entity236 -- of protesters			1

the city parks bureau spent sunday night fencing off the sites			1
mayor @entity247 said late sunday afternoon that " a series of increased drug overdoses ... an arsonist that used the camp as camouflage and almost a 20 % increase in crime surrounding the encampment " prompted the move			0
" all of us are working really hard at keeping the peace and protecting freedom of expression , " @entity247 told @entity0			0
" i support a lot of what the encampment stands for ... ( but ) it should n't be focused on port - a - potties and tents and encampments attracting criminal elements			0
i think this movement needs to evolve			0
" @entity269 , one of the activists , told @entity0 that she was " extremely disappointed that the mayor chose to crack down on these parks when the outpouring of support ( among area residents ) has been so strong			2
" " homeless people exist , drug addicts exist , mentally ill people exist			0
we were a safe place they could go , and that created some problems , " she said			0
" and we were working to deal with those problems , and the mayor cut us off			0
" @entity287 @entity287 said 19 people were arrested saturday night as authorities moved in to clear an @entity291 encampment at a downtown park			2
police had ordered protesters to leave the park after a man was found dead late thursday night			1
the cause of death was thought to be carbon monoxide poisoning and a drug overdose , @entity0 affiliate @entity297 reported			0
" we can no longer tolerate individuals camping on our streets , " @entity287 police chief @entity302 told reporters			2
however , " only camping is over , " @entity287 mayor @entity308 's office said on @entity309 -- protests can continue at the park			2
@entity297 reported authorities said protesters would be allowed to have a 24 - hour presence and one building , but the tents had to go			0
as police moved in saturday evening , according to video from the scene , protesters chanted , " this is what a police state looks like			2
" " our rights to assembly , which are embodied in the @entity326 , are still being violated , " protester @entity323 told @entity297			0
" our forefathers are speaking to us , telling us that this is what assembly looks like			0
not being able to camp here severely limits the ability of us to keep our coalition together			0
" @entity0 's @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 and @entity339 contributed to this report .			0
