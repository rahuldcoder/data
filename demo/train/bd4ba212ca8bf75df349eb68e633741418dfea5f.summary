-- you can cover a lot of territory in @entity4 without ever checking into a hotel			1
overnight luxury cruise liners stacked with saunas , smorgasbords and duty - free shopping sail nightly between @entity10 and @entity11			1
imagine enjoying a @entity4 feast with a vista of archipelago scenery			1
budget travel rarely feels this hedonistic			1
boats between @entity10 and @entity11 offer the delights of a luxury cruise ship at an affordable price			1
two fine and fiercely competitive lines , @entity22 and @entity23 , connect the capitals of @entity25 and @entity26			1
each line offers state - of - the - art ships with luxurious meals , reasonable cabins , plenty of entertainment ( discos , saunas , gambling ) , and enough duty - free goodies to sink a ship			1
of the two , @entity22 has the reputation as the party boat			1
@entity23 is considered more elegant ( but still has its share of sometimes irritating and noisy passengers )			1
the @entity44 and @entity45 of the @entity4 cruise industry vie to outdo each other with bigger and fancier boats			1
the ships are big -- at 56,000 tons , nearly 200 yards long , and with 2,700 beds , they 're the largest ( and cheapest ) luxury hotels in @entity4			1
which line is best ? you could count showers and compare smorgasbords , but both lines go overboard to win the loyalty of the 9 million duty - free - crazy @entity25 and @entity26 who make the trip each year			1
@entity22 has an older , less luxurious fleet , but caters better to low - budget travelers , offering discounts to students , seniors and railpass - holders ; selling cheap " ekonomi " cabins ( shower down the hall ) ; and allowing passengers to pay for deck passage only and sleep for free on chairs , sofas and under the stars or stairs			1
both @entity22 and @entity23 sail nightly from @entity10 and @entity11			1
in both directions , the boats leave about 4:30 or 5:30 p.m. and arrive the next morning around 9:30 or 10 a.m. for exact schedules , see www.vikingline.fi or www.silja.com			1
during the first few hours out of @entity10 , your ship passes through the @entity79			1
the third hour features the most exotic island scenery -- tiny islets with cute red huts and happy people			1
going in this direction , i 'd have dinner at the first sitting ( shortly after departure ) and be on deck for sunset			2
fares vary by season , by day of the week and by cabin class			2
mid-june to mid-august is most crowded and expensive ( with prices the same regardless of day )			2
fares drop about 25 percent off - season for departures sunday through wednesday			2
in summer , a one - way ticket per person for the cheapest bed that has a private bath ( in a below - sea - level , under - the - car - deck cabin ) costs about $ 125			2
couples will pay a total of about $ 375 for the cheapest double room ( with bath ) that 's above the car deck			2
if that sounds expensive , remember that you 're getting overnight lodging , a fun scenic cruise , and substantial transportation to boot			2
the fares are reasonable because locals sail to shop and drink duty - and tax - free			2
it 's a huge operation -- mostly for locals			2
the boats are filled with about 45 percent @entity26 , 45 percent @entity25 and 10 percent cruisers from other countries			2
the average passenger spends as much on booze and duty - free items as for the boat fare			0
the boats now make a midnight stop in the @entity128 , a part of @entity26 that 's exempt from @entity131 membership , to preserve the international nature of the trip and maintain the duty - free status			0
while ships have cheap , fast cafeterias as well as classy , romantic restaurants , they are famous for their smorgasbord dinners			0
dinner is self - serve in two sittings , one at about 6 p.m. , the other a couple hours later			0
if you pay for both the dinner buffet and breakfast buffet when you buy your ticket , you 'll save 10 percent			0
the price includes free beer , wine , soft drinks , and coffee			0
make sure to reserve your table , not just your meal ; window seats are highly sought after			0
smorgasbord translates to something like " bread and butter table			0
" it has evolved over the centuries to the elaborate spread seen today			0
the key is to take small portions and pace yourself			0
begin with the herring dishes , along with boiled potatoes and knackebrod ( @entity25 crisp bread )			0
next , sample the other fish dishes ( warm and cold ) and more potatoes			0
move on to salads , egg dishes , and various cold cuts			0
do n't forget more potatoes and knackebrod			0
now for the meat dishes -- it 's meatball time ! pour on some gravy as well as a spoonful of lingonberry sauce , and load up on more potatoes			0
other roast meats and poultry may also tempt you			0
still hungry ? load up on cheese , fruit , desserts , cakes , custards and coffee			0
@entity192 's most enjoyable cruise , between @entity10 and @entity11 , features dramatic archipelago scenery , a setting sun and a royal smorgasbord dinner			1
dance until you drop and sauna until you drip			0
the next best thing to being in these @entity4 capitals is cruising there			0
