-- after more than half a century involved in motorsport , and three decades at the helm of @entity5 , @entity1 has no plans to quit just yet			1
in fact , the 81 - year - old has told @entity0 that he will be in charge for as long as he lives			1
" it 'll probably depend a lot ( on ) when i die , " @entity1 said ahead of this weekend 's @entity12 when asked about his retirement plans			1
" you never know , do you , with these things			0
i mean , it 's not my intention to do such a thing			0
if i thought i could n't do all the things i do , then the answer would be then we 'd certainly consider it			0
at the moment it 's not quite like that			0
" @entity1 : @entity5 teams agree to race until 2020 despite his age , @entity1 is keeping himself very busy -- both personally and professionally			1
earlier this month he announced his engagement to @entity30 @entity29 , 46 years his junior			1
he has also set his sights on further extending @entity5 's global reach , having announced an agreement with the teams to continue racing under a @entity36 until 2020			2
@entity38 , @entity37 will make its debut as grand prix venue in november , as the sport returns to the @entity42 for the first time since 2007			1
@entity44 was introduced to @entity5 last year , with the @entity46 city of @entity47 set to host a race in 2014 -- the same year the @entity50 resort will stage the @entity51			1
" it 's good to have an @entity42 base , " @entity1 said			1
" we are a world championship , so why not ? we have races in other parts of the world so we should have maybe another race in @entity42			1
" on the possibility of @entity61 hosting a race for the first time since 2008 , he added : " i think maybe the election that has taken place might have put that back a bit			1
when that all settles down i 'm sure we 'll get back on track -- literally , " referring to @entity71 's recent presidential victory			0
" i think you will have to wait and see if we see more			0
" should @entity5 be so unpredictable ? @entity1 has been criticized for his determination to go ahead with the recent @entity74 @entity12 , despite political unrest in the @entity77 kingdom			1
but @entity78 cited the riots in @entity80 as an example of how social unrest does not necessarily mean a country should forfeit its right to host a race			2
" i 'd hate to lose the @entity87 race , for a start , " he explained			2
" we 've seen what happened there at the end of last year , all those disturbances and all the other things that happen all over the world			2
" i do n't know where we 'd have to find a nice place to race where there is no problem			2
it would n't be easy			0
" one arena @entity5 has not managed to enter is the @entity103 , but @entity1 revealed that talks over the seemingly far - fetched possibility have been held			1
" i spoke to the former president , mr. ( @entity106 , years ago about this and we decided it was wrong to have mechanical sport involved			2
in fact i discussed it with the new president ( @entity112 ) a year ago			0
" they keep adding things in which i do n't believe are @entity103 things , so maybe it 's possible			0
it would be nice to see it happen			0
" the current @entity5 season 's first five races have produced five different winners for the first time since 1983			2
a major factor in the sport 's current unpredictability has been the new @entity127 tires -- the team which masters the rapidly degrading rubber usually emerges victorious			0
seven - time world champion and @entity133 driver @entity131 has been heavily critical of the tires , telling @entity0 they are like driving on " raw eggs , " but @entity1 praised the work done by the @entity137 manufacturer			1
" i asked @entity127 if they could make a tire that would only run for a third of the race , which is a lot more difficult than making a tire that will run the whole race			2
that 's easily done ; it can run five races if you like			0
" but to make one that will only run that distance is difficult			0
they 've done a fantastic job and that 's what has made this racing so exciting			0
" when reflecting on his contribution to @entity5 , @entity1 was relaxed when asked if he has received enough credit for what he has given to the sport , responding : " i get what i deserve , i suppose			1
" and what is it that keeps the @entity164 going after so long at the forefront of an ever - expanding business ? " job satisfaction			0

@entity1 tells @entity0 he intends to run @entity5 until he dies
the *octogenarian* has been running the sport for the last 30 years
@entity1 hopes grands prix in @entity61 and a second race in the @entity42 can be agreed
the 81 - year - old defends the decision to host a race in @entity74 last month
