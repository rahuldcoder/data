-- so , you think you have it bad this tax season			0
have you heard that @entity4 founder @entity3 will pay between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion in taxes ? that sounds like a tough pill for anyone to swallow			1
but it is premature to start a pity party for @entity3			0
the twenty - something billionaire reaped large financial gains from exercising the stock options that triggered his tax bill , and he has benefited from favorable tax rules along the way			1
even better , @entity3 will survive his encounter with the tax man in a position to never have to pay taxes again for the rest of his life			1
let 's start with the tax bill			0
according to media reports , @entity3 reported $ 2.3 billion income from @entity4 's ipo in may 2012			1
how did that happen ? by contract with his own highly controlled company , @entity3 has many stock options			1
the options give him the right to buy shares for a preset price : 6 cents , to be exact			0
so on the day of @entity4 's ipo , with shares trading as high as $ 42 , @entity3 bought 60 million shares for 6 cents each : a great way to net a cool $ 2.3 billion			1
the @entity42 views that money as compensation -- wages -- taxable at " ordinary " income tax rates , the same that most of us pay on our regular salaries			0
this means , for 2012 , @entity3 will have to pay tax on the $ 2.3 billion at close to a 50 % rate , federal and @entity53 taxes combined			1
the resulting whopping $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion tax bill continues a theme , evident in my @entity0 columns on @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , that wage - earners are highly taxed , but not the wealthy			1
so should we feel sorry for @entity3 ? before we start crying , let 's step back a bit			0
as soon as @entity3 exercises any of his stock options he triggers a tax hit			1
he did just that when he bought the 60 million @entity4 shares for 6 cents each			0
but from that moment forward , @entity3 is responsible only for any further rise in the value of the stock , and only when he sells it , and , even then , only at the far more favorable " capital gains " rates			2
@entity3 's $ 2.3 billion payday also came after years of building up value in @entity4 , meaning that he was deferring paying taxes for years			1
this is considered a financial benefit : it is better to pay taxes later rather than sooner , all things being equal			1
it also bears mention that all things were not equal , because 2012 featured one of the lowest top ordinary tax rates in a century of income taxes , at 35 %			2
most observers were assuming that rates would increase in 2013 , as they in fact did			0
@entity3 cashed out at both a high market price and a low tax rate			2
one puzzle to tax experts is why @entity3 waited so long to cash out , causing that large ordinary income tax hit			2
the answer likely has several parts			0
one , @entity3 's timing almost certainly played a role in boosting @entity4 's stock price at the ipo stage , when it peaked			2
two , it is obvious that @entity3 had indeed cashed out , in large part , before the ipo			0
how else did he get to a net worth of more than $ 11 billion , according to media reports , with a ( mere ) $ 2.3 billion payday , roughly cut in half by taxes , further reduced by a falling stock price ? at a minimum , buying shares during the ipo allowed @entity3 to cash out at the market top , and then to sell off shares -- as he did " for tax purposes " -- without any additional tax hit			1
indeed , @entity3 now holds shares with tax losses built into them , which he can sell to offset capital gains elsewhere in his portfolio			2
@entity3 also has plenty of other shares ( and still more options ) , rising in value as we speak			0
he is playing what i call @entity128 101 , simply holding onto assets as they appreciate without paying tax on them			1
@entity3 's tale is really just another story about stock options , the coin of the realm in @entity138			1
they can be tricky and easy to manipulate			0
remember the backdating scandals ? those were about the timing of the exercise of stock options by highly paid executives			1
after his big stock option exercise , @entity3 can walk in the footsteps of hi - tech icons such as @entity149 and @entity150			1
these entrepreneurs built up vast fortunes using stock options with great savvy and then , after they made it to the levels of the super-rich , simply got rid of their ordinary income salaries			1
@entity150 , famously , got paid $ 1 a year to run @entity159			2
@entity149 one - upped that by stepping down altogether from his day job as ceo of @entity163			0
the really rich leave wages and the w - 2s that go with them to the little people , like us			0
the truly rich do not have to pay any tax once they have their fortunes in hand			0
they can follow the simple tax planning advice to buy / borrow / die : buy assets that appreciate in value without producing cash ( like shares of @entity182 stocks ) , borrow to finance lifestyle , and die to pass on a " stepped up " basis to heirs wherein the tax gain miraculously disappears			0
@entity3 now has $ 11 billion or more with which to play this game			2
he can live off money borrowed against that huge sum ( rest assured , he can get good interest rates ) , never having to sell any asset at a gain , and never having to get an " ordinary " salary again			0
as is so often the case , the real wizard here is @entity58 , who got into the game in the early 1960s , buying up a company , @entity200 , that pays no dividends			0
@entity58 was able to amass his fortune , well north of $ 50 billion , without ever incurring a tax bill nearly as large as @entity3 's			1
we can not all be @entity205 , of course , but being @entity3 is n't too shabby , even with that more than a billion dollar tax bill coming due			2
@entity3 can rest peacefully knowing he wo n't have to worry about paying taxes again			1
the rest of us are n't quite so blessed			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			0

@entity3 will pay between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion in taxes for 2012
@entity216 : but he never has to pay taxes again for the rest of his life
he says @entity3 can hold on to assets as they appreciate without paying tax on them
@entity212 : like other tech titans , he can build wealth by using stock and stock options
