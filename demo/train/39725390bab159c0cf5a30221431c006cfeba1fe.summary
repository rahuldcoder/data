@entity0 -- the remains of two men found in the wreckage of the @entity5 ironclad @entity6 11 years ago are being laid to rest friday in @entity7 in @entity8 after an extensive but unsuccessful quest to discover the sailors ' identities			1
in what seems like a real - life " csi " episode , a military lab was able to narrow the remains ' identities down to five or six men using dna samples , facial reconstructions and bones -- but not to the individual sailors			1
with the measurements from the remains , examiners were able to determine scientifically the average height of the individuals and their age			2
one of the sailors ' teeth had been worn away where he held a pipe his whole life			2
the researchers also had other clues like the items and clothing left with the two men , including buttons from a uniform , a gold ring , a comb , some coins and a pair of mismatched shoes			2
one of the sailors " had a different shoe on his left foot than he did on his right , " said @entity48 , the conservation project manager for the monitor			2
" it is hard to explain why that is			0
one of the possible options is as these guys were leaving the ship the night of the sinking , it was chaotic , it was dark			0
perhaps they just grabbed the nearest clothing they could find			0
" the monitor 's 1862 battle against the @entity70 ironclad @entity69 @entity8 was perhaps the most famous naval engagement of the @entity5 , signifying the end of wooden warships and the move to ironclad ones			1
the two ships traded point - blank shots at each other in the @entity81 before both withdrawing from the fight , each crew thinking the other had either been sunk or damaged enough to retire			0
on december 30 , 1862 , the monitor was caught in a storm while being towed off @entity85 , @entity86			1
although equipped with various engines and pumps , the ship could n't keep up with the volume of water rushing in , and it sank to the bottom with 16 sailors			1
the monitor went undetected until 1973			0
the two crew members ' remains were discovered in 2002 some 240 feet below the surface in the ship 's 120 - ton turret			1
due to the location of the remains , it 's possible the two were trying to get out through the gun turret when the ship went down			1
in addition to the remains in the turret , there were shoes , coats , boots and other personal items -- as if the crew members had been discarding clothing to keep from being pulled down into the water as they tried to escape			2
as they narrowed down the men 's identities , investigators were able to eliminate @entity122 - @entity121 sailors and officers			1
the bones were @entity125 , and the buttons were not from officers ' coats			0
more than 30 living descendants of the crew were to attend the @entity7 burial			1
because the remains are being buried as unknown , these two men will represent all 16 lost			1
" the definition of family in this particular case is a little different than in a contemporary casualty loss , " @entity48 said			0
" they view them as their ancestors , and they are there to honor all 16			0
" @entity142 , superintendent of the @entity144 's @entity143 , said the burials are part of a long military tradition			2
" whether it was 150 years ago or two weeks ago in @entity149 , the nation 's commitment to bringing ( its ) fallen home , laying them to rest and returning them to their families stays as strong today as it ever was			0
" capt. @entity157 , who led @entity159 dives to the wreckage , agreed			0
" we needed to take all the appropriate steps necessary to recover those sailors with all the honors and dignities , " @entity157 said .			0
