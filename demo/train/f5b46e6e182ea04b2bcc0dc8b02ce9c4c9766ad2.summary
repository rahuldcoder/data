-- instant messaging , texting , @entity3 , and ... " @entity1 ? " the " @entity1 " games effectively adapt to changing communication habits , @entity4 , the ceo of game publisher @entity5 , told @entity0 on tuesday			1
and that could be the smoking gun in the franchise 's takeover of the video - game industry			2
the latest entry in the console - game series , " call of duty : @entity17 , " has netted more than $ 1 billion in sales worldwide since it came out on november 9 , @entity5 announced on tuesday			1
in that time , gamers have spent 600 million hours with the game , the company said			0
" more people play ' @entity17 ' every day than watch @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , combined , " @entity4 boasted			0
" the audience of ' @entity1 ' is probably greater in terms of size ... than in any other interactive form of entertainment			1
" @entity5 did n't invent war games or first - person shooters			1
even today , the genre continues to attract new big - budget entrants			0
on tuesday , @entity34 released " battlefield : @entity36			0
" yet it 's the " @entity1 " games that attract blockbuster openings and fervent support			1
by some estimates , " @entity17 " had the biggest five - day opening in revenue of any entertainment debut in history			0
the " @entity1 " games generally feature compelling , cinematic storylines			1
in " @entity17 , " soldiers are tasked with assassinating @entity49 leader @entity48			0
but it 's the competitive play that draws the biggest crowds , @entity4 said			2
some 60 % of traffic coming through @entity55 's @entity54 online gaming service is from " @entity1 " games , where players can take each other on , he said			1
" the multiplayer is really the thing that has changed the game in such a meaningful way , " @entity4 said			0
instead of getting together to watch a movie , some people huddle around the living - room game console , or strap on a headset and chat online with friends across town or across the country over some gunfire			0
" if you look at the 500 million people who are on @entity3 and the way that people text each other and instant message and use video chat , there is now an evolution of media , " @entity4 said			1
" those are the characteristics and attributes that a generation and audiences feel are very important to their media and entertainment experiences			0
" " @entity1 " delivers on that trend , he said			1
these games can be as integral to the social lives of young people , especially males , as any other form of digital communication			1
@entity4 rattled off various factors he says make the " @entity1 " franchise stand out from competitors -- " production value , the level of polish , " that " no detail gets left unaltered , " he said			2
perhaps most important is " the sophistication and capability of the multiplayer matchup , " @entity4 said			0
" @entity17 " credits @entity5 's @entity107 studio as the primary developer			1
the game came under scrutiny from video - game critics after a shakeup at @entity113 , the developer most often associated with the franchise			0
@entity5 fired two executives from @entity113 for " wrongdoing " -- " so wrong that you were left with no choice " but to dismiss them , @entity4 said			2
their positions have since been filled after the company was flooded with about 5,000 résumés , @entity4 said			0
" multiplayer has been largely developed by @entity107 , " even in games like " @entity127 , " which were credited to @entity113 , @entity4 said			2
" i do n't think @entity107 got their due for how much they contributed in the production and polish to the multiplayer			0
" future " @entity1 " games may borrow some things from @entity133 's other massive franchise , " @entity132 , " @entity4 said			1
for example , developers should constantly mold their games based on audience feedback , he said			2
" @entity133 really created the model for how to do this successfully and effectively , making sure the community of ' @entity132 ' players has incredible influence on the future of the product , " @entity4 said			1
" there 's so much more that we can deliver to our players			0

" @entity1 " effectively adapts to changing communication habits , says @entity5 's ceo
