@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 roared ashore last year , @entity3 was hit hard			1
the slow - moving storm whipped up a powerful tidal surge that breached sea walls protecting @entity0 , a bedroom @entity8 community , and flooded @entity3 's home to the tune of thousands of dollars in damage and months of home repair			1
this year , it happened again			2
superstorm @entity15 and its rare mix of converging weather set records as it barreled into the @entity21 on october 29 -- but its local effects may not have seemed so rare to @entity3 and others who had survived @entity4			1
experts warn of impending superstorm era just like in 2011 , floodwater poured into the low - lying neighborhoods of @entity0 , knocking out power and filling @entity3 's basement			1
now , the father of three says he 's considering cutting his losses and moving out			2
" the more this flooding happens ... the lower property values will sink , " @entity3 said			1
" i 'll end up being underwater , literally			0
" like many of his neighbors , @entity3 rents out his building 's first floor to help to pay his mortgage			1
now , his tenants are gone , having left in @entity15 's brutal aftermath			1
" not only are we dealing with repairs , now we 're dealing with the loss of rental income and carrying the full mortgage until we can clean up the area , " he said			2
@entity49 residents sue utilities after @entity15 when @entity15 unleashed its deadly torrent of wind and water , @entity3 and his family rode it out inside their home as river wash leaked through his first floor and raised anxieties about how much higher it would get			1
a swollen @entity61 had expanded into his backyard			0
when it finally receded , the flood left an auburn - colored watermark on his basketball hoop backboard			0
the hoop was about 7 feet tall			0
afterward , the dials on his electrical boxes filled with bubbling pockets of a brownish liquid that seemed to foreshadow the string of electrical problems that would follow across the region			0
not forgetting the lack of electricity after of @entity4 , @entity3 had prepared for @entity15 , purchasing a generator just days before it hit			1
after the storm , he ran electrical cables across the street to his neighbors ' homes , padlocking the generator to his wrought iron stoop out of fear of looting			0
" i 'm sure there were people watching and waiting for me not to be near that generator , " he said			0
at the height of the crisis , @entity3 said , police and fire officials told him to hide the machine at night because it would take them hours to respond to an incident in his neighborhood			1
" ' we 're just overstretched , ' " he quoted authorities as saying			0
that triggered shades of vigilante justice across his neighborhood , though @entity0 police could not be immediately reached for comment regarding the claim			1
" i have neighbors across the street who have firearms who told me , ' do n't worry about it , ' " he said			0
" ' just call us ( if there 's a problem ) and we 'll be right outside with a gun			2
' " preparing for lesser disasters @entity15 triggered massive flooding across the @entity21 , yet the effect of the floods may have been especially foul in @entity0			1
that 's because the city maintains a combined sewer and rain drainage system , meaning floodwater also spewed from pipes , swirled into basements and probably contained raw sewage , according to accounts from local residents and city officials			1
" this happened with @entity4 too , " @entity0 mayoral spokeswoman @entity127 said			1
the sewage " could n't flow out because the water was at its highest capacity			0
... so when the water came into ( people 's basements ) , it was n't just water			2
" but any sewage overflow that occurred was considered minimal , according to the head of @entity0 's @entity139			1
" did it occur on an extensive basis ? absolutely not , " @entity142 said			0
after paying a remediation company to sanitize his basement , @entity3 disagreed			1
he and his neighbors point to the city 's antiquated sewer system as a primary culprit			1
" i had to get this whole area disinfected , " he said , standing in his basement illuminated by floodlights			0
last year , @entity0 's drainage system was the focus of a lawsuit from the @entity155 , which said the city failed " to properly operate and maintain its combined sewer system			1
" the city settled the suit in july of last year and pledged to invest more than $ 52 million in infrastructure repairs and upgrades			1
and yet those incremental updates may actually miss the bigger point , as many say that little done at the municipal level could have blunted the power @entity15 unleashed on the region			2
the more pressing issue may be how to decipher ways to best protect the city from lesser , more frequent storms , while enlisting federal support for the kind of long - term infrastructure needs that lie ahead			2
" @entity15 was to some extent unavoidable , " @entity3 said			1
" but @entity4 was a flood that never should have happened			2
" to rebuild or not the gas shortages and massive power outages that plagued @entity1 after @entity15 and a nor'easter that struck a week later are now starting to dissipate			2
the state lifted gas rationing orders monday , and only about 4,000 customers across the state were still without power as of wednesday			0
at the height of the storms , more than 3 million customers in @entity1 were without power			0
yet restoring power to many of those still in the dark requires inspectors to go door - to - door to check individual electrical panels , to avoid triggering further damage , such as electrical fires			0
opinion : rebuilding after @entity15 too big a risk still , the cost of rebuilding is in the billions			2
and @entity202 , 45 , said he expects the damage to his @entity0 home after @entity15 to be much higher than it was after @entity4			1
" last year , our tab for fixing everything was about $ 15,000 , " he said			0
" this year , it 'll be twice that			0
" others , like @entity3 , say they are again shelling out for those home appliances and other items that they expected to buy only once or twice			1
" i just spent money again on a washer - dryer , " he said			0
" i bought one last year too			0
these are the things you buy and expect to last 10 years			0
" looming over many of these twice - battered storm victims is a basic question : " how much is enough ? " and yet despite the chorus of @entity224 voices that warn of a recurring rash of inclement weather in the region , others say market forces will still probably absorb the risks tied to waterfront property and prevent a downward price spiral in real estate			0
" there might be temporary blips on the radar , " said @entity233 , president of @entity234 , a @entity49 - based real estate firm that specializes in rentals and home sales			0
" but if history teaches us anything , people always rebuild and they always come back			0
" football players help fellow @entity15 victims			2

last year , @entity4 flooded @entity3 's @entity0 home
today , he 's dealing with the aftermath of @entity15
last year , the city 's drainage system was the focus of a lawsuit brought on by the @entity155
