" if i had n't left @entity8 , i would n't be an artist , i would be a doctor , " she said			1

i felt something really good was happening there			0
" if i had a list of all the things i wanted , this residency was at the top			0
" i applied towards the end of my year at @entity111 , but i did n't think i would get it because it was very competitive and a lot of people apply several times			0

i was very surprised to get it first time			0

" now it 's over i want to try and continue with the rigor of being in a studio every day			0
