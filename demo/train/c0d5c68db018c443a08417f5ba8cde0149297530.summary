when his son , @entity3 , was found with his body headfirst in a rolled - up gym mat at @entity6 in south @entity7 , authorities offered their take on what happened : the 17 - year - old had been reaching for his sneaker when he got caught up in it , then suffocated to death			1
in other words , it was all a tragic accident			1
" when he came up this cockamamie story of how they found @entity3 , " the late student 's father said friday of the local sheriff , " ... right there , from the beginning , we had no reason to trust them at all			1
" because they did n't show us justice			0
" the questions surrounding @entity31 's death ten months after burying their son , the @entity1 family says that 's all they 're looking for -- justice			1
not to declare his case closed , as the @entity39 did after a @entity41 autopsy found that @entity3 died of position asphyxia			1
the @entity1 's skepticism led them not to give up , but to push on with their own investigation			1
a second autopsy conducted by a private pathologist , at the request of @entity3 's parents , found he died because of " unexplained , apparent non-accidental blunt force trauma			1
" there have been more questions since then , including why their son 's body and skull were stuffed with newspaper before his burial			1
the pursuit of getting answers has made the pain of losing a son -- a boy they described as jovial , polite and good - hearted -- a little more bearable			2
" just to know that we 're fighting for @entity3 is what gets me up in the morning , " his mother , @entity66 , told @entity0 's @entity67 on friday night			2
" we know we 've got to fight a little harder every day			0
" attorneys call for release of surveillance video conflicting determinations of what happened a loving son and brother , a three - sport athlete who never got in trouble with the law , a jokester who made every day fun , a gentleman with good manners and a sunny disposition			2
that was @entity31 , in a nutshell , his parents say			1
" every parent all over the world would want to have a son like @entity3 , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity67			2
" @entity3 was a great boy			0
" on january 11 , he was in the gymnasium of @entity6 in @entity92			0
a few still images , taken from surveillance cameras , are perhaps the last of @entity31 alive			1
they show him walking across the bare floor with no one else in sight , though it 's quite possible that other , unreleased pictures would show @entity3 was n't alone			2
the next pictures of the teenager are far more horrifying : his body , clad in jeans and layered orange and white t - shirts , is wedged in the wrestling mat. his face is bloated with pooled blood , some of which poured out of his body and soaked his dreadlocks and spilled onto the floor			2
there were more streaks of blood on a nearby wall			0
but it was n't @entity3 's , investigators say			2
in fact , the @entity41 told @entity0 on thursday that dna tests to try to determine whose blood that was found no match			2
lt. @entity128 , from the sheriff 's office , told @entity0 in may that the blood looked like it had " been there for an extended period of time			2
" a pair of orange - and - black gym shoes are found a few yards from the teen 's body			1
they had a substance that looked like blood , though investigators told @entity0 that it was not -- which is why the shoes were n't collected for potential evidence			0
nor was a hooded sweatshirt a few feet away			0
" i do n't believe this was an accident , " said @entity144 , an @entity145 private investigator who looked at the death scene imagery			1
" i think this young man met with foul play			0
" and dr. @entity150 , the private pathologist hired by @entity1 's family who conducted the second autopsy , found that @entity1 had a blow to right side of his neck " consistent with inflicted injury			1
" " i 've never had a case that i can recall where the prosecution actually was told that this may well be a homicide -- the prosecution being the state , the police and so forth -- and then they did n't bother prosecuting , " said @entity150 , from @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159			2
" yet a number of official reports paint a different picture			0
a january 25 report by the @entity92 - @entity171 cited " no signs of blunt force trauma on @entity1 's face or body			1
" and the original autopsy results released by the @entity41 may 2 identified " no significant injuries			0
" body stuffed with newspaper mother : we 'll keep at it ' until we get justice ' so what is the truth ? the @entity1 family says one way to find out is through a coroner 's inquest , a process in which a panel -- after reviewing evidence and testimony -- decides on a cause of death			1
they plan to file a lawsuit as early as next week to force the district attorney to force such an inquest			0
if this process ends with a ruling @entity31 's death was a homicide , not an accident , then authorities would logically reopen their investigation			1
and with that , the @entity209 hope , they 'll find out who is responsible			0
maybe then they 'll see the full surveillance footage from the school gymnasium that winter day , which might show whether anyone else was there with @entity31			1
and maybe they 'll find out who stuffed newspaper in place of the teenager 's internal organs			0
@entity41 spokeswoman @entity221 said the organs were placed in @entity1 's body before it was sent to a funeral home			0
the funeral home 's owner , @entity226 , wrote to the family that his firm never received the teen 's organs , claiming they were " discarded by the prosecutor			0
" @entity66 says the family is committed to keeping @entity3 's spirit alive			0
they held a party this week to mark what would have been his 18th birthday			0
and @entity66 says she still talks to him , up in heaven , to " tell him that i love him and i missed him			0
" asked why she does , the mother said , " it just gives me more motivation to keep fighting for him -- until we get justice			0
" @entity31 's death was not accidental , family 's autopsy finds @entity0 's @entity250 contributed to this report .			1

@entity31 , 17 , was found dead in a rolled - up mat a high school gym
authorities closed the case on him , saying his death was an accident
his parents believe otherwise ; they say a second autopsy proves it
the @entity266 are pushing for a coroner 's inquest , reopening the case
