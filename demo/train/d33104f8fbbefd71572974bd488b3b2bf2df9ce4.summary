-- the captain and second officer of a container ship that ran aground last year , resulting in @entity5 's worst maritime environmental disaster , have been jailed for seven months			1
@entity6 ( @entity7 ) said in a statement friday that skipper @entity9 and @entity10 -- both @entity12 nationals -- were found guilty of a total of 11 offences , including operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk , discharging harmful substances , and willfully attempting to pervert the course of justice by altering ship 's documents subsequent to the grounding			1
the cargo vessel , @entity26 , hit a reef off @entity28 in clear conditions on october 5 last year			1
at least 350 tons of fuel oil spewed into the sea , killing thousands of sea birds and contaminating the pristine beaches of @entity28 's @entity34			1
after a passage plan for the vessel 's journey had been plotted , the captain gave approval for the second officer to deviate from the plan to save time , @entity7 said			1
the subsequent changes to the ship 's course , which were not verified using appropriate navigational methods , put the vessel directly on target to hit the @entity49			2
about 10 minutes before the grounding , the reef appeared as an echo on @entity26 's radar			2
at this stage , there was still sufficient time to make an effective alteration of course and avoid the reef , the @entity7 statement said			2
the captain saw the echo and assumed it was a small vessel -- but when he could not find it , he dismissed it as a false echo			0
these two senior officers , who were responsible for the safe navigation of the ship , had failed in their duty , @entity7 director @entity66 said			0

" if there is a need to deviate from a prepared passage plan , the alterations must be plotted and the new projected path carefully assessed to ensure all potential navigational hazards are identified			0
" @entity66 added that both officers also admitted making alterations after the grounding to the ship 's gps log , its passage plan and its computer to mislead investigating authorities			0
" this offending is also very serious in that it caused genuine confusion for investigators trying to piece together the events that led to the grounding , " he added			0
" it is vital that when these types of events do take place , we can find out how and why they have happened to help prevent such an event happening again			0
" earlier this week , @entity7 said " excellent progress " has been made on container removal from the wreck site over the past week , with 21 containers removed from the bow section of the vessel on monday -- the highest number of containers removed in a single day since the break up of the wreck			0
