-- when is a website crash not a crash ? that question has been on the minds of many since the government official responsible for the beleaguered @entity8 site testified wednesday before @entity9			1
@entity11 secretary @entity10 apologized and took responsibility for what she called " miserably frustrating " problems with the site , which launched october 1			1
but it was a parenthetical comment that turned heads			2
" we were anxious to get the website up and running and functional , which we clearly have failed to do to date , " @entity10 said			1
" although , i would suggest the website has never crashed			2
it is functional but at a very slow speed and very low reliability			0
" has n't crashed , really ? critics of the site 's failures -- as well as of the @entity29 itself -- immediately pounced on her statement			1
one congresswoman pulled up the @entity29 site on an overhead projector during the hearing , appearing to show that it was n't accessible at the time			1
( in fairness , it 's not clear whether that problem was due to the site itself or a problem with host @entity46 's servers that cropped up in the past few days			1
for what it 's worth , it was opening for us just fine wednesday afternoon )			2
so , while @entity10 owned up to the errors that have plagued the site for the millions trying to use it , she seemed to be suggesting that , since the entire thing has never ground to a complete halt , it has n't " crashed			1
" tech community , how does that sound ? " the site was crashing , " said @entity58 of online security firm @entity59			1
" a crash is defined in the basic sense as an application not behaving as anticipated or not being able to handle something due to programming flaws , " @entity58 added			2
" the system does n't work or stops serving because of the issues , " he said			0
" basically , exactly what happened to the @entity8 website			0
" the definition at internet - centric encyclopedia @entity71 is similarly broad			0
it defines a crash as " a serious computer failure			2
" " a computer crash means that the computer itself stops working or that a program aborts unexpectedly , " the definition continues			0
@entity58 said that what 's been happening with the health care website is different from slowness caused by heavy traffic , which is not uncommon when sites debut to higher - than - expected popularity			1
instead , @entity58 said , the site is delivering error messages and not letting people register , suggesting flaws in its coding			0
technicalities aside , the wags of the @entity92 were having fun with @entity10 ' comment			1
" depends what the meaning of ' crash ' is , " wrote conservative blogger @entity96			0
" like , was it driving a car and it did n't crash into anything , so the website made it home from soccer practice ? or , does the website only go to parties to which it has been invited ? " @entity110 , of course , chimed in			0
" the @entity112 did n't crash , " wrote @ @entity111			0
" it was just flying on the ground while on fire			0
" @entity116 , a reporter for @entity117 , wrote than @entity10 should do an @entity118 , the popular question - and - answer sessions on @entity120			2
" that , " replied @entity122 editor @entity121 , " would crash @entity120			0

health secretary says @entity29 site " has never crashed "
@entity10 apologized for " miserably frustrating " problems
but tech experts say the site 's *glitches* *qualify* as a " crash "
some on the @entity135 *mocked* her comment
