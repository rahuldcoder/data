-- few games live up to 11 years of anticipation , but " @entity4 's " slick upgrades mean the sequel 's got a shot			1
at midnight july 27 , @entity7 switched on the servers for " @entity4 : wings of @entity10			1
" the original " @entity4 , " released in 1998 , became an overnight success , selling 1.5 million copies in its first year on the way to more than 11 million copies sold in its lifetime			1
a decade on , the sci - fi game -- which pits human @entity19 against alien @entity21 and @entity22 races in a real - time strategy war that spans the galaxy -- is still revered for its precise balance and easy - to - learn , hard - to - master game mechanics			2
" @entity4 " became especially popular in @entity27 , where professional players can earn upward of $ 100,000 a year and expert matches get televised nationwide			1
at first glance , it seems @entity7 has taken an if - it - ai n't - broke approach to " @entity4 's " gameplay			1
the biggest improvements to the single - player campaign have been in the presentation			1
in the original game , you were simply flung from one mission to the next with nothing but a short mission briefing , or perhaps a brief cinematic scene once in a blue moon			2
in the sequel , you spend your downtime hanging out inside the spaceship owned by series protagonist @entity47			2
inside @entity47 's ship , you can spend the money you make from missions on upgrades for your army			0
many upgrades consist of simple stat enhancements , but some unlock new abilities for your units			0
it 's a fun way of introducing rpg elements that provides a tangible feeling of progression			0
another change from the original " @entity4 " : you can now choose the order in which you tackle certain missions			1
it 's not as if you have complete freedom : you will usually be presented with two missions to choose from			0
this means the game follows a branching storyline of sorts , although so far i have always been able to go back and complete missions i skipped			0
optional objectives within the missions themselves range from rescuing oppressed villagers to collecting a number of doodads strewn across the map			2
this idea is very similar to @entity7 's 2002 game " @entity86 " ( the last real - time strategy game the company released )			2
the rewards are usually worth the trouble			0
if you rescue hapless villagers , they 'll join your ranks			0
if you collect doodads , you 'll be given more money with which to upgrade your units			0
eleven years of technological progress means " @entity4 's " storytelling methods are n't as primitive as they were in 1998			1
the first " @entity4 " employed mid-mission dialogue , but the animation was limited to a few pictures of talking heads			1
" @entity4 , " on the other hand , benefits from the fully rendered cinematic scenes we 've come to expect of modern gaming			1
these scenes are excellent : the facial expressions , character movement , sound direction and art design all come together to make a gripping plot , at least from what i 've seen so far			0
it helps that @entity7 boasts some of the best artists in the business			0
" @entity4 " might be somewhat low - tech compared to graphics juggernauts like @entity119 or @entity120 , but because of its excellent art direction , it is arguably more visually appealing than either of those games			1
" @entity4 " uses a wide range of colors , and the attention to detail on things like marines ' mechanized moving parts or the fluorescent glow of laser beams is spectacular as well			1
i have n't yet played " @entity4 's " final multiplayer mode , but i did play a great deal of the multiplayer beta and came away impressed			2
@entity7 's overhaul of its classic @entity140 service is geared toward helping strategy newbies become competent , offering an array of challenges designed to teach important multiplayer skills			0
" @entity4 " is a long time coming , and with fans currently caught in the throes of launch ecstasy , it 's still too early to tell if it will ultimately prove to be worth the wait			2
but based on my first impressions , it would have to screw up pretty hard to not be			0
