-- being a good father is attracting attention these days			1
consider : @entity3 plans a new reality show this fall about dads who work at home , called " @entity8			2
" the @entity9 has ordered a new series co-written by @entity11 called " dads			0
" @entity15 's " parenthood , " which features some dads at home , has been renewed for a fifth season			1
@entity18 carries more than 100,000 books about how to be a father , almost as many as it sells on how to be a mother			1
search on @entity24 for " being a good father or dad " and you get about 600 million results			1
government agencies and private organizations spend millions of dollars promoting responsible fatherhood			0
even prisons have caught the fever , offering young incarcerated fathers classes on coping with baby tantrums and preparing baby food			2
here 's the problem : despite the hoopla over involved dads , more children than ever live without a father in the home			1
in 1960 , the figure was one out of 10 children			0
today it 's one out of three			2
a new study sponsored by the @entity47 suggests one reason why			0
research shows that four out of every 10 new fathers -- especially younger , less - educated men -- said their babies ' births were unintended			1
and we know from research that those fathers , in particular those who are not married to their children 's mothers , are more likely to walk away from the family than fathers whose children were planned			1
could it be that by focusing so much attention on how to be a good father , we have failed to talk enough about when to become a father ? over the last half - century , fathers have tripled the amount of time they spend with their kids , but that 's only about half as much time as mothers spend			1
television studios may be excited about dads who work at home , but in fact such fathers are only 3.4 % of parents at home full time			1
we consider contraception " a female problem			0
" we discuss the timing of pregnancy and parenting less often with young men than with young women , and even family planning programs have n't been very successful in reaching the guys			2
this may help explain why 18 - to 29 - year - old men , who say it is important to avoid pregnancy " right now , " are more than twice as likely as young women to say they would be pleased if they found out that their partner was pregnant , according to a 2010 report by @entity94 to prevent teen and @entity96			0
the report said this was true both for men living with their partners and those who were not			0
perhaps some of those men hold on to the tired assumption that fathering a child makes them manlier			2
perhaps others are genuinely interested in having a child			2
what we know for sure , says @entity109 , co-author of " @entity110 , " is that if being a parent is harder than men thought it would be , " they can easily leave their partners holding the bag			0
" and many young fathers do that			0
in fact the proportion of mothers in this country who are single , 36 % , is rising , particularly among low - income mothers , and it shows no signs of slowing down			0
fatherhood should begin not with having a baby , but being thoughtful earlier about how one would support a child			0
questions about becoming a father are not that different from those for a would - be mother : are you in a stable , committed relationship ? how well do you and your partner know each other ? how much do you trust each other ? do you have enough education to secure a good job ? if you and / or your partner are employed , do you earn enough to support your family ? are you ready for the lifelong responsibilities of being a parent ? there are other considerations for men who want to be involved fathers that are not so obvious			1
@entity145 , management professor at the @entity147 's @entity146 , raised some of them in a recent blog for @entity151			0
men are increasingly interested in " engaging more fully as caregivers and homemakers , " he wrote , but gender stereotypes hold them back			0
" men may wonder , what if i 'm just not a good dad ? what if i 'm perceived by my friends as unmanly because i 'm doing ' women 's work ? ' what if my children seem me as a poor role model because i 'm not the main breadwinner ? what if my boss thinks i 'm less committed because i 'm not at the office as much as the other guys at my level ? " these are all good , important questions to think about before starting a family			1
because the best thing you can do to be a good father is to wait until you 're ready to be a father			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity181 : lots of new shows , books and programs on being a good father these days
that 's good , she says , but fewer and fewer @entity192 families have a dad at home
fathers more likely to walk away when a child was *unplanned* , she says
@entity181 : let 's *emphasize* that the best way to be a good dad is to wait till you 're ready
