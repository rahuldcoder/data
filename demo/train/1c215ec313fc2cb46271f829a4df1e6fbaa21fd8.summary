the @entity7 will face off against the @entity8 in @entity9 on february 1 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
whether you 're a hardcore @entity13 fan or just a wannabe watching the game for the halftime show and commercials , here are 5 things you need to know for the @entity6 : this will only be the 11th time that the no. 1 team from the @entity23 will play the no. 1 team from @entity25			1
and this matchup of no. 1 seeds is happening for the second year in a row			2
usually one of the top teams stubs its toe in the playoffs on the way to @entity6 glory			0
winning the big prize twice is just plain hard to do			0
but if the @entity7 succeed in winning another championship in two weeks , they will be the first repeat @entity40 in a decade			1
no team has done that since ... the @entity8 in 2005			1
speaking of the @entity8 , the @entity44 - @entity43 era in @entity8 has been nothing short of phenomenal			1
the coach - qb combo has produced three @entity6 wins , 12 division championships and a record of 180 - 55 together			0
but there 's more history to be made			1
@entity44 -- now the winningest coach in @entity13 postseason history with 21 wins -- will become only the second coach to appear in six @entity6 , while @entity43 will become the only quarterback to play in six @entity6			1
after this year 's title tilt , the @entity13 will break with tradition ( for one year ) and ditch using roman numerals in the @entity6 name			0
the 2016 version of the championship game -- the 50th , to be played in the @entity64 ' @entity63 -- will simply be known as @entity6 50			0
the roman numerals are set to return in 2017 for @entity66			0
some folks ( ok , lots of folks ) , do n't care about the game at all			0
they 'll be watching to see who 's performing at halftime			2
after many years of halftime shows featuring a musical mashup of singers and groups ( up until the @entity79 - @entity78 fiasco ) , the @entity13 seems to have found a winner with shows focused on a single artist			2
think of the great @entity6 halftime shows put on by @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
and @entity88 simply set the stage on fire last year			0
this year get ready to " roar " with @entity91 , and she 's bringing in @entity92 for backup			1
@entity94 ( best known to little girls everywhere as @entity96 ) will sing the national anthem			0
oh , and for those keeping up with such things ( for entertainment purposes only , of course ) , the early @entity99 line on the @entity6 has @entity104 as a slight favorite over @entity8			1
but that 's subject to change during the next two weeks of unyielding buildup to the game .			0

@entity7 seek to become first repeat champs in a decade
@entity8 ' @entity43 , @entity44 look to make more history together
