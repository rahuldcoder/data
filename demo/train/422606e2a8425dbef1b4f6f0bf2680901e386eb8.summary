-- @entity1 still remembers the day she discovered her own mother could be her own worst enemy			1
she was paying for her lunch when her debit card got rejected in front of everyone			1
she ran back to the bank where she worked and pulled her records , only to discover a middle - of - the - night withdrawal from a bank near her mother 's home			2
the night before , as she was sleeping , it looked like her own mother had nearly emptied her account			2
it was hurtful , " said @entity1 , who remembers thinking that her co-workers at the bank must wonder how a mother could steal her child 's money			2
" it was only a small amount of money , but it hurt worse than anything she 's done , because she took something from me			2
" i have met these @entity27 many times over , young women whose own mothers drag them down even as they already face terrible odds			1
these are mothers who engage in a stunning role reversal at the very moment their children need them most , demanding their daughters become caregivers , bail them out of trouble , support them when they can barely support themselves			1
the first warning sign is neglect this alarming role reversal begins with neglect			1
each year , the @entity41 records 6 million cases of child abuse or neglect , 80 % of them cases where parents , many of them mothers , put their own children at risk			1
what sometimes happens next , but you do n't hear about as often , is that many of those mothers demand their children care for them , even after they stopped caring for their children			1
" those mothers can have many needs themselves , and the one person who can fulfill those needs is that child , " says @entity54 , a psychiatrist and the author of " back to life : getting past your @entity61 , " a book about how people can overcome trauma			1
the problem is particularly acute among children of the poor and of substance abusers , children who already face obstacles getting ahead			1
i know a young woman named @entity75 who aspired to finish college and thought she might even count on her mother for some minimal help with the huge loans she needed to pay for school			1
instead , she says , her mother used her social security number to rent an apartment			2
she left @entity75 with unpaid bills and ruined credit			2
@entity85 ( not her real name ) was raising her son by herself and trying to go to school			2
even as she struggled to find baby - sitting and juggle her schoolwork , her mother treated her like a renter , expressing jealousy that @entity85 was getting to go to school			2
then there was @entity95 , a beautiful dark - eyed academic superstar , whose mother barely provided for her , even as she had so many unmet needs			2
one day when @entity95 was in high school , she came home to discover her mother had gone to live with her boyfriend			2
" she left , " she told me			2
i could see everything in this young lady closing down as she said the words			1
" did she tell you where she was going ? " i asked			2
" no , " she said			2
and we both began to cry			2
no idea of normal " to these girls , normal is something that looks like a @entity114 film , " says @entity54			1
" they have no idea what a normal mother - daughter relationship looks like			2
they get used to it being this way , so it just continues			2
" a common thread in such relationships , says @entity54 , is substance abuse , because it gives the mother something in her life that overshadows her children , blurs judgment and creates need			1
that 's been the case for @entity1			0
her mother , @entity133 , was addicted to crack when she became pregnant			0
she was already having trouble raising two sons and had no job and no stable relationship			0
@entity133 is frank when she tells her side of the story : " being honest with you , i told @entity1 i did n't want her even when i was pregnant , but i 'm glad i did n't get rid of her			1
they had told me i could n't have any more kids , and i went out on a drug spree			1
i was so surprised when i found out i was pregnant , i had to check into a mental institution for six months to get over it			0
" @entity1 ended up living with her grandmother , where she thrived and became a good student			0
her mother loomed over her like a dark shadow , entering and re-entering her life as she faced her addictions			0
@entity1 went to college ; her mother went to jail			0
her grandmother 's diagnosis of cancer forced @entity1 to make a heart - wrenching decision			0
" my grandmother had taken care of me , and now i had to take care of her , " @entity1 recalls			1
she left college , a mountain of debt wasted , and began caring for her grandmother			0
her mother seemed like she might rally and help her out , but once again , it was n't to be			1
" i thought this would bring my mother and i together , but all she did was cry and cry , " @entity1 remembers			0
as @entity1 watched her grandmother succumb to cancer , her mother brought new problems			0
@entity1 bought her a car , and @entity133 got drunk and had an accident			0
@entity133 's boyfriend was stopped on a dui , which was another fine			0
then a relative crashed the car , leading to hundreds of dollars in repairs			0
@entity133 recalls how @entity1 stood by her			0
" she took care of six or seven payday loans			1
she took care of me , " she said			1
" she is a good person to lean on			0
" after @entity1 's grandmother died , her mother leaned even harder , falling into debt by buying insurance policies for every family member			0
@entity1 again had to step in and rescue her mother			0
" i 've struggled because i love her , and i was raised to respect her as my mom			0
she did n't give me up for adoption , " said @entity1			1
" but it 's a struggle			1
" outside intervention that is when our foundation stepped in			1
my husband and i started the @entity206 @entity205 two years ago to help promising girls who were future leaders			1
we wanted to help them navigate around the people and things that become obstacles to their success			1
we also wanted to give them the funding that puts them within reach of a better life through education			0
we have adopted 23 scholars so far			0
our mentors aim to give our girls a taste of what a functional family looks like by helping them with simple things such as choosing clothes for an interview , shopping for textbooks or celebrating good grades			1
we sent @entity1 back to college and assigned a mentor to help her navigate her upside - down relationship with her mother			0
it was clear from the outset that @entity1 could n't let go of her mom easily			1
" she needs me too much for me to move away			0
it 's almost like she is trapped at the age she was when she started using drugs			0
like she is a teenager , and at some point i moved past her and became an adult , " said @entity1			0
@entity54 says it 's naive for women such as @entity1 to believe their moms will ever just go away , but they can learn to negotiate and set limits			1
" the whole notion that they will just get rid of their mothers does n't work so well , because i know very few people who can do that , just shed their family or their history			1
... their parent is really impaired			0
the best you can hope for is that they can stop having the expectation that this will turn into something normal			0
" @entity1 says she knows her mother 's behavior is a danger sign , not something she should readily accept			0
she has cut off access to her passwords and no longer will give her money directly			0
she no longer trusts her , even thought she loves her			0
" who runs out in the middle of the night with someone else 's debit card to get cash if they 're not using drugs ? " she asked			0
" i do n't want to be helping her get in more trouble			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : many young women struggle because mothers do n't fulfill their role
she says it happens most often with substance abusers who fail their kids
when young women need help most , they wind up having to care for their moms , she says
@entity206 : her foundation helps promising girls overcome obstacles
