@entity0 , @entity1 -- opponents of an @entity5 community center and mosque planned to be built near ground zero say it would desecrate hallowed ground			1
but suspicion has greeted proposed mosque projects in places less hallowed than ground zero -- in @entity13 , @entity14 ; @entity15 , @entity16 ; @entity17 , @entity18 ; and elsewhere			0
this suggests that opposition to mosques is not driven only by sensitivity to the memory of terrorism victims , but also by a growing unease toward @entity5 , fueled by security fears			1
opposition to @entity5 centers and mosques in the @entity29 shows remarkable similarities to @entity32 movements in @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35 , where people also have sought to prohibit new mosques			1
last december in @entity39 , citizens voted in a referendum to prohibit new minarets			0
another trait shared by @entity32 movements on both sides of the @entity45 is that they increasingly justify their opposition by arguing that @entity5 is not a religion			1
for example , in his campaign preceding @entity51 's recent elections , extreme right - wing parliamentarian @entity48 repeatedly argued that @entity5 is a political ideology			2
@entity14 lt. gov. @entity55 , in his failed gubernatorial bid , suggested that the freedom of religion enshrined in the @entity58 might not apply to @entity59			1
" you could even argue whether being a muslim is actually a religion , or is it a nationality , way of life , a cult , " the @entity61 candidate told an audience in @entity13			0
disturbingly , these assertions are often embraced by people looking to justify their intolerance			0
counterclaims and evidence from religious leaders , intellectuals , government officials and others have little impact on this misperception			0
why is @entity5 no longer considered a religion ? @entity29 and @entity82 debate on @entity5 often revolves around the question of whether @entity5 is compatible with @entity85 - style democracy and values			1
but because many @entity92 associate @entity5 with @entity93 , @entity89 militant groups and @entity91 theocracy , they have a constricted , one - dimensional view of a faith that is multifaceted and complex			2
no doubt , some political groups are at war with certain @entity5 regimes like those in @entity100 , @entity101 or @entity102 , and with the @entity92			2
but some @entity92 see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion			2
those people who were already suspicious of @entity5 can justify their hostility because , instead of a religion , @entity5 is considered an ideology emanating from @entity119 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and the rest of the @entity5 world to threaten the @entity92			1
it 's worth noting that we did not seek to explain the violence and terrorism of @entity124 through the lens of @entity126 and @entity127 only ; nobody scoured the @entity129 for verses about violence and war			1
observers , instead , cited political , economic and historic factors to explain the conflict			0
by the same token , no one would argue that @entity137 , or @entity138 , exclusively represents @entity139 , or that the murder of abortion doctors represents the essence of @entity143			2
but when it comes to @entity5 , ignoring important economic , historical and political factors has become perfectly acceptable			2
politicians , pundits and ordinary americans see @entity5 -- not political groups using @entity5 rhetoric -- as an existential threat to @entity85 secular norms			1
so , they believe , restraining it justifies extraordinary measures , even those that violate @entity29 values and the @entity156 -- such as trying to ban mosques			0
how did this collusion between politics and culture happen ? it would be misleading to think that this perception is new			0
it has existed since colonial times at least , and remains prevalent because it taps into images and memories intrinsic to the historical consciousness of @entity85 politicians and intellectuals			0
scholarly literature often echoes stereotypical images of @entity5 and @entity59 , such as women in burqas or bearded fanatics with bulging eyes shouting slogans			1
in some cases , headlines come directly from titles in academic journals and books : " the muslims are coming ! the @entity59 are coming ! " ( pipes , 1990 ) , " @entity185 " ( @entity186 , 1990 ) , " @entity189 , @entity5 , and democracy " ( @entity187 and @entity188 , 2002 ) , " @entity191 : @entity192 and @entity193 " ( @entity186 , 2003 ) or " @entity194 : how @entity195 and the @entity92 " ( @entity196 , 2002 )			1
when @entity82 were building new political principles based on the sovereignty of the people , they defined them in opposition to their most powerful political neighbor of the time : the @entity204			0
" oriental societies " were represented as simply the negative counterpart of @entity85 societies			0
@entity5 and @entity59 became the typical " other			1
" we seem to need to exist in opposition to an @entity210 , and in today 's national folklore , @entity5 plays that role			1
not surprisingly , contemporary political @entity5 groups across the globe play the same game , manufacturing their legitimacy as a product of opposition to their own other , the @entity92			2
it is impossible for societies to completely rid themselves of this polarizing rhetoric			0
that said , societies differ in the degree to which their political imaginations are subjected to open critical discussion			0
it is the strength of democracy in the @entity29 that such debates can exist , so demonization of the @entity210 wo n't ride roughshod over reason			0
@entity59 have a crucial role to play in these debates			0
most @entity59 in @entity82 , the @entity29 and even in parts of the @entity5 world view the presence of @entity5 in the @entity92 as a chance to overcome such polarization			1
prohibiting mosques does n't advance these society - saving debates , and ca n't reshape our imaginations so that we can one day imagine @entity5 and @entity59 as fellow citizens			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			0

@entity244 : opposition to mosques shows a growing unease and fear of @entity5
opponents *mix* up terrorists *spouting* @entity5 rhetoric with the religion , she says
@entity244 points out @entity143 was not *blamed* for the terrorism during @entity124 conflict
she says rather than demonize the " other , " we must imagine @entity59 as fellow citizens
