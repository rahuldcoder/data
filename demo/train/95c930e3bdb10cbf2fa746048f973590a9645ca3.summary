@entity0 -- @entity2 does n't go outside very often			0
from 9:30 a.m. until 11 p.m. , six days a week , the 50 - year - old massage therapist works out of a dingy parlor in @entity0 's @entity5			2
there 's no commute as @entity2 lives on site			0
on his day off he spends his time indoors			0
he goes outside primarily to buy groceries , or visit the bank			0
" sometimes it makes me depressed , " said @entity2 when reflecting on his condition			0
@entity2 is blind , and his life is similar to the roughly 120,000 blind massage therapists in @entity15 today , according to a 2012 report by @entity17			1
after he lost his sight at the age of 15 , he did n't have many educational or employment opportunities outside the massage industry			1
but that may be changing			0
@entity15 's @entity26 decided to provide @entity27 or electronic versions of this june 's " gaokao , " @entity15 's brutally competitive national college entrance exams , effectively opening the door for blind citizens to access higher education			1
while the move is hailed as a breakthrough by many human rights groups , some critics caution that the proof will only be in its implementation , and that much more needs to be done to improve the lives of the disabled			2
@entity40 , founder of non-profit organization @entity41 , has been working on disability issues in and around @entity15 since the 1990s			1
he was unimpressed by the new blind - friendly exams			2
" it 's fairly meaningless , " said @entity40			1
the root of @entity40 's skepticism lies in the spotty record of the @entity15 government in enforcing its directives over the entire country			2
particularly in @entity15 's rural areas , a lack of resources and a lack of political will have often undermined efforts to help blind people in the past			1
a world apart @entity15 has the largest population of blind people in the world , according to the @entity62			1
when they are educated at all , blind people are shoved into segregated schools that are isolated from the rest of society			1
higher education exists only in the form of a few specialized universities where the only majors offered are massage therapy and music			2
as a signatory to the @entity74 @entity73 , @entity15 agreed to the principle of " an inclusive education system at all levels , " yet critics on the ground say the situation in practice is profoundly different			1
the exclusion of the blind from mainstream society , and the social attitudes it has fostered , has resulted in a rippling effect of adverse consequences			2
" it 's a kind of apartheid , " said @entity40			0
many @entity15 who are born blind are simply abandoned by parents unwilling to incur the costs of raising them			1
for those that lose their vision later in life , the transfer to special schools typically results in the loss of sighted friends and acquaintances			0
since the career paths of the students are all but predestined , the curriculum at blind schools are often not as rigorous			2
" we 're not required to finish everything , " said @entity107 , a former student of the @entity108 for the @entity109			0
" i do n't really think society has expectations from people with disabilities			2
" since the blind have virtually no other employment options , they are often exploited by employers who pay meager wages			0
one study by the @entity123 found that intermediate level blind massage therapists in that city made between rmb 1200 and 3000 a month ( around $ 191 to 479 ) , a figure far lower than sighted counterparts			1
@entity129 , a 63 - year - old blind therapist from @entity130 says he thinks he gives a better massage than a sighted masseur : " it 's very hard for blind people to get a job , so we are more likely to cherish the work we do			1
" future vision @entity15 's semi-official organ for dealing with blindness is the @entity141 , and they are forthright about the scale of the problem that blind @entity15 face			1
" it 's not fair that blind people have so few opportunities , " said an official from the association who requested anonymity			1
" the problem is that massage is the quickest way for blind people to get a job			1
" the association defended the use of blind schools as a matter of practical necessity and insisted that it would be impossible to train teachers in mainstream schools to deal with the volume of @entity15 's visually impaired students			1
they also pointed to the new regulations by the @entity26 as proof that they had achieved results			0
the association , however , offered no solution to the problem of implementation that @entity40 and others cited as crucial to the success of the new regulations			0
whether it 's a success or not , the matter is ultimately moot for many , including @entity2			0
with his best years behind him , @entity2 has no plans to sit for the " gaokao , " even if it is made available			0
" it 's a pity that it did n't come out earlier , " he said			0
" i have forgotten everything			0

blind people have few opportunities in @entity15 and most become massage therapists
to get into college in @entity15 , one must pass the " gaokao , " which will be offered in @entity27 this june
critics say the @entity27 exam is " fairly meaningless "
