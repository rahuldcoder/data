@entity0 -- welfare reform , which added a work requirement tied to welfare benefits , is often cited as a major bipartisan political success of president @entity7 's second term			1
so the idea of the next @entity10 president , @entity9 , taking the work requirement off the table is political dynamite			2
apparently , the @entity15 campaign believes it is			2
a @entity15 campaign ad titled " @entity17 , " which came out earlier in august , says that 's just what @entity9 did			1
" on july 12 , president @entity9 quietly ended the work requirement , gutting welfare reform			1
one of the most respected newspapers in the country called it ' nuts , ' " the ad says			0
" under @entity9 's plan , you would n't have to work and you would n't have to train for a job , " the ad continues			2
" they just send you your welfare check			0
and welfare to work goes back to being plain old welfare ... " but the @entity9 campaign calls @entity15 's ad " nuts			1
" @entity1 's fact - check agrees			0
@entity7 calls out ' disappointing ' @entity15 ad " every single person here who 's looked at it says it 's patently false , " @entity9 said a news conference on monday			1
so where did the notion of a major welfare reform overhaul come from ? where it did n't come from is @entity0 but rather from @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
these states , some with @entity56 governors , asked the federal government for more flexibility in how they hand out welfare dollars			1
their purpose was to spend less time on federal paperwork and more time experimenting with ways to connect welfare recipients with jobs			0
the @entity9 administration cooperated , granting waivers to some states from some of the existing rules			2
the waivers gave " those states some flexibility in how they manage their welfare rolls as long as it produced 20 % increases in the number of people getting work			0
" in some small way , the waivers might change precisely how work is calculated but the essential goal of pushing welfare recipients to work -- something both @entity10 and @entity56 agreed to in the 1990s -- remains the same .			0

@entity15 ad claims that @entity9 has " gutted " welfare reform
@entity15 campaign claims @entity9 plan *eliminates* work requirement
@entity96 allowed some states waivers from existing welfare rules
