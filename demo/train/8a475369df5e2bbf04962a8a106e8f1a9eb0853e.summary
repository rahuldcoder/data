one of the biggest art heists in @entity2 history began when a housekeeper left the home of an elderly bedridden couple			1
" there was a small window of opportunity for the crime to have occurred , " @entity7 art theft detective @entity6 said friday			1
when the housekeeper returned , hooks appeared where paintings once hung			2
the elderly couple , @entity17 and @entity18 , were too disabled to be aware of the daytime burglary in their home in @entity22 , @entity23 , authorities said			1
in all , 12 paintings were stolen , including a watercolor by @entity26 entitled " @entity27 " and a water - based media on paper by @entity30 entitled " @entity31			1
" it took six years for the @entity33 and @entity2 investigators to receive a big break in the case in which a $ 200,000 reward was being offered : an overseas tipster gave information that ultimately led investigators to set up an undercover purchase of the paintings from a man in a @entity45 area hotel			1
nine of the paintings were recovered in that operation in october , and those works are valued at up to $ 12 million , authorities told reporters friday			1
the remaining three paintings are still being sought			2
" this is the greatest value we 've had in recent history , " @entity6 said of the $ 12 million art theft			1
$ 5 million bail @entity58 , 45 , has been charged with receiving stolen property and has pleaded not guilty to the felony			1
he is being held on $ 5 million bail , said spokesman @entity62 of the @entity2 district attorney 's office			1
@entity65 's public defender was n't immediately available for comment			0
authorities are still investigating the case , the @entity33 's @entity67 said at friday 's press conference			1
@entity67 is the assistant director in charge at the @entity33 in @entity2			1
the @entity33 and @entity2 police believe other people were involved in the theft			1
the art was so valuable that the pieces would have been tough to fence , officials said			2
" that 's why these types of crimes do n't make sense , " @entity6 said			0
" maybe a person has the ability to commit the crime ... but then to profit from it , it 's going to be very difficult			0
as you can see , it 's been six years since the crime occurred , and still the art was not sold			2
" these things are one of a kind , irreplaceable and have historical and cultural value , " he added			0
" @entity2 is the second largest area for the visual arts in this country , and we need to have the resources to pursue these types of crimes			1
" mystery deepens investigators do n't have good descriptions for the three other paintings , other than one was by @entity109 artist @entity108			2
that 's because the couple had a large amount of art in their home			2
the recovered paintings no longer have their frames			2
" they are not in as good a shape as they were when they were taken , but luckily , for how they 've been treated , they 're not that bad , " @entity6 said			0
the @entity123 died before the nine paintings were recovered			0
@entity126 died four months after the theft and @entity18 died earlier this year , authorities said			0
the art insurance company now owns the paintings after making a payout to the couple , but under typical policies , a family is allowed to buy back the art and regain title from the insurers , authorities said			2
in the meantime , a $ 25,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the conspirators , authorities said			1
" the @entity33 and the @entity7 will not give up on any investigation until we have been able to recover the artifacts and bring the people responsible to justice , " the @entity33 's @entity67 said			1
