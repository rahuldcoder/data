golf players just keep getting younger			0
first there was @entity2 , who at the tender age of 13 became the youngest player to participate in a @entity6 event			2
but this may , a @entity7 12 year - old will eclipse @entity2 's record to become the @entity6 's youngest ever golfer			1
from the city of @entity12 , @entity10 finished two under par at the @entity15 qualifier to earn one of the three spots on offer for the @entity19 -- the tournament where @entity2 made his @entity6 debut in april 2012			1
now 14 , @entity2 will become the youngest player to compete in the masters when he takes to the course at @entity23 next month			0
competing as an amateur , @entity2 finished tied for 150th at last year 's @entity19 event , which was won by @entity27 's @entity26			1
@entity10 , whose father caddied for him , shot a four - under - par opening round of 68 on tuesday to put himself in contention before pulling clear of the field over the front nine on wednesday			0
four birdies saw him head to the turn on seven under , but @entity10 collapsed at the par five 16th where he dropped three strokes			0
but the 12 - year - old had done enough to ensure he finished third on the leaderboard behind joint winners @entity39 and @entity41			1
should @entity10 do the unthinkable and win the @entity19 , which will take place at the @entity43 , he would assume @entity45 's mantel as the youngest ever winner on the @entity6			2
@entity47 's @entity45 won the 2010 @entity48 at the age of 17 years and 188 days .			0
