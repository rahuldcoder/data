-- when it comes to football , the @entity3 - @entity2 divide is a long and complicated one			1
both @entity3 - branded @entity7 teams -- the @entity8 and the @entity9 -- share fans from across the tri-state area , blurring state lines and loyalties			1
and both teams play at @entity15 in @entity2 , where the @entity16 will be held february 2			2
the official @entity17 estimates the game will bring in between $ 550 and $ 600 million in revenue to @entity3 and @entity2			1
in addition to the influx of @entity16 - goers eating and staying in the region , there will be concerts , meet - and - greet events with the players and even a toboggan set up smack in the middle of @entity29			0
but @entity30 , the mayor of @entity31 , @entity2 , where the game will be played , said it 's unlikely his town will cash in much			1
" i 'm hoping that we at least break even , " said @entity30 , who has been mayor of the town of 9,000 for 19 years			0
tax revenue from the town 's five hotels will provide a slight bump for @entity31 , but @entity30 is skeptical that it will reap many more benefits			2
game - day transportation is set up so visitors must enter @entity15 by bus or train			0
@entity30 said he doubts local businesses will see significant gains from spectators			0
the town also has had to ramp up its police presence for the week			0
" this has already cost us , " he said , adding that even though the event is in @entity2 , " it 's a @entity3 event			1
" " people ( of @entity31 ) are proud to say there will be 150 million people watching and looking at @entity31 , even though all the outside shots will be of @entity3 , " @entity30 said			1
the @entity7 dismisses the theory that the @entity16 is a @entity3 - centric event			2
" there are more activities in @entity2 than @entity3 , " @entity7 spokesman @entity63 said			1
the players are staying in @entity67 and all their media appearances and training will be held in the state			0
still , the issue is sensitive for some			0
on monday , @entity74 sen. @entity73 of @entity2 corrected one of his @entity77 followers who tweeted the incorrect location of the game			1
" no ! the @entity16 is in @entity2 , " he responded			2
at a press conference on thursday , @entity74 sen. @entity80 of @entity2 scoffed at the @entity7 's official @entity16 program cover , which shows the @entity83 with @entity3 as its backdrop			1
a small sliver of @entity2 can be seen in the background			2
" for all of those who are geographically challenged , welcome to @entity2 , welcome to the home of @entity91 , " he said			1
the so - called @entity92 will be across the @entity93 from @entity15 , in @entity94			0
parts of @entity94 , including the stretch of @entity97 from 34th to 47th streets , will be closed to traffic from january 26 through february 2 to make room for a toboggan run , a concert stage and an exhibit featuring the @entity83			0
mayor @entity104 said the @entity16 is " hugely important " for @entity3 and he believes the event will be " an extraordinary moment for @entity3			2
" @entity107 will be involved in @entity16 festivities in some capacity , although it 's unclear whether he will attend the game , said @entity112 , chief spokesperson for the mayor			0
@entity30 , @entity31 's mayor , said he has not been invited to the game			1
he plans to attend a community tailgating party and then watch from home			0
" i 'll be sitting in my recliner , " he said , " enjoying the game			0
