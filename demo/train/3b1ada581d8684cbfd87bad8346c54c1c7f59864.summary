-- passenger @entity1 knew the situation on @entity3 was unraveling saturday when members of the flight crew began snapping at passengers			1
one incident stands out for him from saturday 's flight , which spent more than four hours on the tarmac at @entity11 's @entity10 after being diverted from @entity11 's @entity12			1
@entity1 said he was rationing a limited number of cookies from first - class to mothers and children in coach when a passenger prone to outbursts asked him for a cookie			1
he was about to give her one when a flight attendant ordered her to sit down and told her she would not get a cookie			2
" everyone knew she was a very frantic woman , which is why no one said anything when she asked for the cookie			0
... everyone understood but the flight attendant , " said @entity1 , ceo of the social networking site @entity31 , who documented saturday 's travails using visual updates via the @entity36 app to his @entity38 account			0
" i went to her and said , you need to understand that speaking to passengers like this is not going to do any good			0
you need to exercise leadership and responsibility			0
" @entity1 said the flight attendant dismissed his words , as did the pilot when he took his concerns to the cockpit			0
see @entity1 's visual posts from flight on @entity31 @entity1 said the situation did not improve until the flight was finally canceled , 4Â½ hours after it parked at @entity56 and nearly 12 hours after it took off from @entity58 , during which time passengers say they endured shortages of food and water , crying babies , panic attacks and rising tensions			1
severe storms and heavy winds paralyzed traffic entering and leaving @entity12 airport saturday night , causing most flights to be diverted			0
" although we can not control the weather or the circumstances , we agreed that we needed to have done a better job with making our guests more comfortable in a difficult situation , " @entity3 spokeswoman @entity71 said in an e-mail			1
but if the delay had occurred a few weeks later , @entity3 might have faced more than $ 3 million in fines for staying on the tarmac for more than three hours			1
under the rule , which takes effect april 29 , airlines could be fined up to $ 27,500 per passenger for tarmac delays lasting more than three hours			1
passengers were offered two opportunities to leave the plane after it parked on the tarmac at @entity56 , and 20 of the 126 passengers chose to do so , @entity71 said			1
@entity93 policy dictates that @entity3 will never hold guests longer than three hours without the ability to leave the aircraft , she said			1
" although guests were able to leave the aircraft during @entity3 , if the ruling were in place we would have made the decision to cancel at the 2 - hour mark instead of the 3 - to 4 - hour mark , which is our current practice , " @entity71 said			1
" we are in full compliance with existing rules and are prepared to be in full compliance with the new ruling when it is issued			0
" the @entity108 is investigating the @entity3 incident , said spokesman @entity110			2
" the whole thrust behind the rule is to prevent passengers from being subject to that , to the delays in the aircraft , " @entity110 said			2
@entity117 has joined @entity118 and @entity119 in requesting an exemption at @entity12 to the tarmac delay rule set , according to the @entity108			0
the closure of a major runway at @entity12 prompted the exemption requests , which would only apply to that airport for the duration of construction on the runway			0
even in situations when the flight can not operate , the rule would ensure that passengers are allowed to get off the plane and return to the terminal , @entity110 said			2
@entity135 echoed the concerns of @entity118 and @entity119 in its @entity12 exemption request			0
" carriers , faced with increased operational difficulties as a result of constrained runway capacity just at the time the new tarmac delay rule goes into effect , and with the prospect of incurring $ 27,500 per passenger in fines , will inevitably cancel flights during challenging operational situations , " the airline 's @entity108 request said			1
@entity1 said he supports the idea of fining airlines for delays as an incentive to ensure that other passengers do n't have to endure the same experience			1
" i would like on my left to be the ceo of @entity3 and on my right , the ceo of @entity118 to vouch with me for this bill , " he said			2
" that 's the kind of leadership that 's required and demonstrates that these @entity162 understand that passenger safety and customer service comes first			0
" @entity1 and his seatmate , " @entity167 " judge @entity165 , used @entity168 and @entity38 , respectively , to issue updates on their ordeal			0
" was stuck on a plane for five hours on a @entity172			0
they ran out of food , a woman was escorted off by police and i 'm grateful to new friends , " @entity165 tweeted at 11:14 p.m. , after the flight was officially canceled and remaining passengers were led off the plane			2
@entity182 's tweets @entity1 posted intermittent updates to @entity31 using his @entity36 app while the flight was in progress			0
" tensions rising big time as we are grounded and passengers are trying to get off , " he said in one post accompanied by a photo of passengers lining up in front of the cockpit to deplane			2
" @entity3 crew losing control of passengers			1
police now onboard here , " he said in a later post			0
on sunday night , @entity1 says he received a phone call from @entity3 ceo @entity203 telling him that he 'd seen his posts and expressing apologies			2
@entity1 attributed his use of social media to convey the severity of the situation as a factor in @entity3 's decision to refund passengers the cost of the airfare plus a $ 100 credit			1
" you ca n't just write in a complaint or call customer service anymore ... social media , it 's the only weapon , " he said			0
" airlines need to be more terrified of that than the actual bill , because they 're going to have to compensate passengers anyway each time they get held up on the tarmac , but they 're also going to lose passengers because their brand will be destroyed every time a passenger uses social media			1

five - hour flight lasts more than 10 after severe weather diverts it

@entity3 apologizes , says passengers were able to deplane
