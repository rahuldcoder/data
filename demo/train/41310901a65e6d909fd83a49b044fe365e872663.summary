editor 's note : @entity2 , a native of @entity3 , is senior fellow for the @entity4 of the @entity5 at the @entity6 , a @entity7 - based think tank that says it is dedicated to " global security , prosperity and freedom			1
" from january 2003 until 2006 , @entity2 directed the @entity11 at the @entity12			2
@entity2 says the @entity13 can learn much from @entity3 's expertise on @entity15 and @entity16			1
( @entity17 ) -- @entity3 greeted president @entity18 with huge excitement monday			1
this was the first time a @entity13 president visited @entity3 at the start of his term , sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of @entity3 and wants to engage with it from the start			2
his address in the @entity3 parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an @entity13 leader in such a setting : he not only showed his deep understanding of @entity3 's many complex issues and identities , but also handled tough issues with great skill			1
he framed his talk just right by underlining @entity3 's @entity43 identity as a secular democracy			1
that said , it is important to remember how good @entity13 - @entity3 relations were at the start of the @entity50 administration			1
president @entity50 also considered @entity3 an extremely valuable partner , but then came the @entity53 war			0
the @entity13 genuinely believed @entity3 would be one of the most important allies going forward			0
despite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing @entity13 military to cross into @entity53 via its lands , the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears			0
as a result , they based a whole military strategy on the @entity3 parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral			0
with @entity18 's election , there is renewed excitement in @entity3			1
like most of the people of @entity3 , he opposed the @entity53 war and considered @entity15 the " good war			1
" going forward , as president @entity18 underscored in his speech , @entity3 can play an important role in @entity15 as a reliable @entity79 ally			1
the question is : how can @entity3 best help ? @entity3 is one of the few -- possibly the only -- @entity79 member that has deep religious , cultural and historic knowledge of both @entity15 and @entity16			1
in fact , the @entity3 government has brought together the presidents of @entity15 and @entity16 much before the @entity13 began approaching them together			1
reading the tea leaves , one may conclude that the @entity18 administration wants to cooperate with @entity3 in engaging with the @entity90 in @entity16 and @entity15			1
this would be the wrong kind of cooperation			0
although @entity3 has channels to the @entity90 and has means to facilitate the talks , there can not be a morally acceptable deal reached with the @entity90 , whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights , especially when it comes to women			2
no matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy , pulling @entity3 into any kind of engagement with the @entity90 -- either as part of @entity79 or bilaterally -- would have much worse long - term consequences			2
instead , the @entity18 administration needs to think of " victory " not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective , but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands			2
in other words , providing true safety , security , justice and development for @entity15 and @entity16 -- not the kind of society the @entity90 has been providing			1
indeed , it is in providing the basic securities that @entity3 can be a great partner			0
@entity3 not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security , but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects , such as building hospitals , schools , sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the @entity15 and @entity16 societies			1
there are many @entity3 companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002			0
there are also military and civilian trainers , nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions			0
still , @entity3 can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the @entity13 frame the challenges it is facing in a more accurate and honest way			2
just as president @entity18 referred to his personal story and that of the @entity13 to help @entity3 look deeper within , @entity3 can do the same for the @entity13			2
to start , @entity3 can explain how the vast @entity153 region it belongs to is not just part of the " muslim world " but has been at the crossroads of eastern and western cultures and ideas and witnessed many brutal wars and massacres over the millennia			2
moreover , each country has its own spirit -- there are ancient cultures and tribal formations , and these do not move fast			0
it is important to stop and drink the tea			0
@entity3 can also explain that it is only in recent decades that jihadism and extremism took root in these lands known for their @entity175 teachings that talk about love , instead of hatred			0
as a true partner , it can also help the @entity13 recognize its share , along with many others , in inadvertently contributing to the creation of the @entity90 and @entity182 by making bad foreign policy choices			0
anything short of recognition of the past catching up with us will leave us all unprepared for what may come in the future			0
in other words , we may be doomed to repeat the same mistakes until we learn our lesson			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity18 's speech shows deep understanding of @entity3
she says administration needs to make good use of @entity3 's role in region
@entity2 : using @entity3 to make peace with @entity90 would be a mistake
she says @entity3 can help rebuild @entity15 and provide security
