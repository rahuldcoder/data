@entity0 -- as it nears the 10th anniversary of the terrible events that led to its creation , the @entity2 is getting a report card of sorts			1
and the grade , to few people 's surprise : incomplete			0
in a massive 221 - page report , the @entity12 -- the investigative arm of @entity13 -- says @entity2 has " made significant strides in protecting the nation , but has yet to reach its full potential			1
" @entity1 obtained a draft of the report , which is to be the subject of a @entity22 hearing on wednesday			1
the @entity12 report is largely a compilation of previous @entity12 reports , and gives no new recommendations			1
but for @entity29 buffs , it is a virtual catalogue of the work that has been accomplished since the department was formed in 2003 , and the work that remains to be done			0
the @entity12 said the department has addressed about half of the 1,500 recommendations it has made over the years , and is working on other recommendations , but has left some untouched			1
formed from 22 different agencies , the @entity2 is now the third - largest department in the federal government			1
it has more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget that has grown from about $ 39 billion in fiscal year 2004 to about $ 55 billion this year			0
readers of the report will find a wealth of information about the department 's accomplishments , and of woeful lapses , all organized in 10 areas of responsibility , such as " aviation security , " " border security , " and " emergency preparedness			1
" in a written response to the report , the @entity2 accentuated the positive			1
" @entity56 is a stronger , safer and more resilient country because of the work @entity2 and its many partners do every day , " wrote @entity2 's @entity55			2
@entity55 wrote the @entity12 report neglects to mention some @entity2 accomplishments , such as improvements to terror watch lists and implementation of the @entity64 , which requires documents from border crossers			1
the following is a summary of key areas in the report : @entity71 the report says @entity2 has enhanced aviation security by improving the pre-screening of passengers , checkpoint screening , baggage checking and airport security			1
the @entity79 currently has about 54,800 people , and a $ 7.7 billion annual budget			0
but the @entity12 said it is unclear whether full - body imagers would have detected the so - called " underwear bomb , " which failed to ignite on christmas day of 2009 when passengers intervened			1
@entity2 also has not validated the science behind behavior detection officers			0
and it does not yet have a way to ensure that air cargo screening is being conducted at reported levels			0
@entity91 the report says @entity2 has deployed more than 600 miles of infrastructure , such as fencing , along the border , and implemented a program to verify the identities of foreign visitors to the @entity56 but @entity2 has not implemented a program to track when visitors exit the country , nor has it fully followed up on plans to improve @entity104 security			2
@entity105 the report says @entity2 improved port security by tightening access to ports , conducting advanced screening of foreign seafarers entering @entity56 ports and developing a security credential for truckers and other entering ports			2
it also developed a strategy for cargo container security			0
but the @entity12 noted that during covert tests , investigators were able to enter ports using counterfeit credentials or authentic credentials obtained fraudulently			0
and the @entity56 has trouble tracking smaller , noncommercial vessels , it says			0
further , @entity2 has not yet developed a plan to fully implement a requirement that 100 percent of @entity56 - bound container cargo be scanned by 2012			0
@entity128 the report says @entity2 increased resources to investigate people who overstay their visas , and alien smuggling operations , and improved @entity134 , a computer tool that allows employers to verify a person 's authorization to work in the @entity56			2
it also expanded efforts to remove criminal aliens in jails and prisons from the @entity56			0
but key weaknesses remain in @entity2 's efforts , the report says			2
while @entity2 field offices had closed about 34,700 overstay investigations during the past six years , the cases resulted in about 8,100 arrests , a small portion of the estimated overstay population of 4 million to 5.5 million .			0
