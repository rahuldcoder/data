@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 first heard that a massive earthquake had leveled @entity6 , @entity7 , it hit close to home			1
his brother lives in @entity7 , and thankfully survived the january 12 disaster unharmed			1
@entity4 's first instinct was to help his home country			1
" i said to myself , ' i need to go to @entity7			1
' " after speaking to his brother , he realized that he would need a skill that was in immediate demand			0
otherwise he would just be in the way of other relief efforts			0
so he came up with a unique idea			0
" i decided to give @entity7 what i have , which is teaching , " said @entity4 , who is a @entity19 professor at @entity20 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" i do n't think i can give @entity7 a better gift			1
" and that 's how his @entity7 creole class was born			1
" i 'm just giving something that has been given to me , " @entity4 said , referring to his native language			1
his class is n't made up of the typical credit - craving college co- ed. that 's mainly because the vast majority of students have long since finished college			0
the class is free of charge and open to everyone			0
the roster of students includes local doctors , nurses , physical therapists , social workers , lawyers and ministers			0
all of them have either been to @entity7 or are planning volunteer trips soon			1
" they appreciate when you try , " said @entity46 , a retired nurse who travels to @entity7 to volunteer			2
" i just want to learn a few phrases so i can greet them and ask how they are			0
" retired educator @entity51 has been to @entity7 three times in the past four years			2
she has been working on a collection of personal stories of people living in @entity7			2
she says knowing more @entity56 will make conducting her interviews easier			2
" i needed to learn something about the language because particularly i found that i could n't have any conversations with women , " @entity51 said			0
" the women either do not speak @entity63 or they 're more shy about trying it			0
" she said it was hard finding someone who spoke the language in @entity68 , @entity1 , let alone providing a free class			2
@entity4 began teaching in february , and now helps students for one hour every tuesday			1
he has about three dozen students			0
" it is so gratifying ... to see that there are people out there who want to help , " he said			0
" @entity76 are in the form of people			0
" @entity4 has lived in the @entity79 since he was 20 , but he says his heart remains in his home country			2
" @entity7 , in a way , capture the essence of the human spirit , " @entity4 said , sharing his love for , as he puts it , " my people			1
" even if his students only learn a few simple phrases in @entity56 , @entity4 says it will have a profound impact			1
" if they see an @entity79 say ' how are you today , how are you feeling , what hurts ? ' ... i know the smile that would put on somebody , " he said			0
" the appreciation they would get to see an @entity79 not only care enough to be there but care enough to learn the language to speak to me in my own tongue and make me understand that i matter ... i know the joy that would bring to a @entity7 's heart , " he said			1
" i do n't think you could give @entity7 a better gift			0

@entity4 teaches @entity19 at @entity20 in @entity0 , @entity1
now he 's teaching @entity7 creole to volunteers *heading* to @entity7
@entity4 says even a few @entity56 phrases would bring joy to most @entity7
