as it continues to ramp up its efforts for the 2012 election cycle , a national umbrella organization for the tea party movement readily admits its grassroots organizing strategy is borrowed from the left 's political playbook			1
" whether they win or lose a campaign , an election , a fight of some kind -- did they come out stronger than they went in ? " is how @entity9 , @entity10 ' director of state and federal campaigns , described the grassroots approach utilized by liberals			2
@entity22 , @entity10 president and ceo , pointed to a strategy that was " very consistent with all of the left 's literature on community organizing			2
" he attributed a specific phrase that the @entity30 group has adopted -- " winning by building and building by winning " -- to the @entity32 in the 1990s			0
" i stole it from them , " he said			0
the strategy was a recurring theme at a recent gathering of roughly 100 conservative activists who came to @entity39 for a weekend of training hosted by @entity10			2
tea party 2.0 : upgraded for 2012 the event opened up a window into the metamorphosis of the tea party movement -- from mass protests in 2009 into an increasingly sophisticated and coordinated political movement focused on november 's elections and beyond			1
to that end , @entity10 shared its " triple dip " strategy of focusing on states that will be critical in winning the @entity52 , increasing the @entity54 majority in the @entity52 and flipping control of the @entity56 into @entity58 hands			2
although the conservative grassroots movement has had some electoral successes , it is not without its critics			0
calling them " wacky , " sen. @entity64 , @entity65 , recently faulted the uncompromising views of @entity68 , the @entity30 - backed @entity54 @entity56 nominee in @entity69 who ousted longtime @entity58 sen. @entity70			2
@entity72 contributor @entity71 was cautious about the ability of the tea party movement to swing control of the @entity56 to the @entity58			1
@entity71 pointed out that the @entity56 does n't have highly ideological districts like the @entity52 and , therefore , a @entity58 @entity56 candidate must balance appeasing conservatives during the @entity58 primary against the risk of losing the whole state in the general election			0
@entity71 called the @entity30 's decision to back @entity68 and unseat @entity70 " a very high - risk decision " because it opens up the possibility that @entity85 @entity84 could win the @entity56 race in november			0
@entity88 , @entity89 political reporter and author of " @entity91 : @entity99 in @entity100 , " observed that while the tea party movement might not have wielded much influence in selecting @entity95 as the @entity58 's presumptive presidential nominee , the conservative grassroots movement has been influential in some @entity56 races during this election cycle			1
tea party groups target @entity56 after presidential ' disappointments ' specifically , @entity88 noted the tea party movement 's successful effort to oust @entity70 , who many conservatives in @entity69 felt was too moderate , and a similarly motivated effort against longtime @entity58 sen. @entity107 , who is facing a primary challenge from a tea - party backed candidate			1
" if you look at the @entity56 race , " said @entity88 , " they got rid of [ @entity107 ] @entity70 and in @entity115 they 've kept the candidacy of @entity117 alive ... and , of course , @entity107 [ is ] having his fight in @entity120			0
" @entity122 primary heads to runoff @entity88 says the shift toward more targeted grassroots political activism is a natural outgrowth of the tea party movement 's success in the 2010 midterms when dozens of fiscally conservative @entity52 members were elected			1
@entity22 said that when armed with the right tools , the grassroots activists have the power to change the political landscape in the short - and the long - term			1
" it 's all about this community of people and how connected they are and how many new people they can bring into the system , " @entity22 told @entity72 , " and so every fight we fight -- and it could be a policy fight , it could be building a protest , it could be a book club , it could be a policy seminar , or it could be get - out - the - vote -- all of those things serve two purposes			0
one is to accomplish whatever the task is , but the other is to build organization			0
and we think that is the key to everything			0
" @entity22 added that he believes the tea party movement continues , in his view , to exceed expectations because " you ca n't see the building of a community			1
you ca n't measure it until it does something			0
" @entity22 explained how a connected community of activists can get established and then engage in get - out - the - vote efforts			0
" you literally just have to feed the machine -- give them yard signs , give them walking maps [ to help in knocking on voters ' doors ] , give them whatever it is that they want to do and that trumps all sorts of advantages that the establishment has			0
" @entity183 tea party activist @entity181 echoed @entity22			1
" everybody 's fully engaged behind the scenes , " @entity181 said of the tea party movement 's efforts in this key battleground state , " and the only way you 're going to see us is by the fruits of our work			2
" @entity194 , another @entity183 tea party activist , said the movement has gotten away from the big rallies that got so much national media attention			1
" holding up that sign [ at a rally ] does n't do a damn bit of good , " said @entity194			0
instead , @entity194 pulled out his smartphone and declared that " the weapon of choice for patriots nowadays is this thing			0
" while @entity88 observed that the tea party movement has been smart strategically in focusing on building an organization and targeting races where they can have the most effect and achieve their desired outcome , she also sounded a cautionary note about the movement 's future			1
@entity88 pointed out that some establishment @entity54 have begun to push back against the influence the grassroots movement is wielding within the @entity58 ; that public favorability ratings for the movement have fallen ; and that recent skirmishes over the debt ceiling have put a premium on achieving political compromise in @entity39 , a practice that is antithetical to the tea party movement			1
@entity68 was blunt about his dislike for traditional notions of bipartisan compromise			0
" what i 've said about compromise and bipartisanship is i hope to build a conservative majority so bipartisanship becomes @entity234 joining @entity235 to roll back the size of government , reduce the bureaucracy and get @entity239 moving again , " @entity68 said last month on @entity72			0
@entity240 : @entity241 would n't fit in today 's @entity58 @entity88 also said that since its genesis in 2009 and successes in the 2010 midterms , the tea party movement is maturing into an established special interest group within the @entity58 -- into a kind of " @entity248 of the right " that works to move the @entity58 in a more conservative direction			1
@entity71 suggested a demographic motivation for the conservative grassroots movement -- that rather than being driven by partisanship or ideology , the tea party movement , with its older demographic , is actually acting to protect its interest in federal entitlement programs such as @entity259			1
as they look toward and beyond this november , the group of activists returned again and again to a model for how the grassroots conservative movement can coordinate to achieve a desired result			2
longest - serving @entity58 senator loses primary fight after detailing the 18 - month campaign to unseat @entity70 that was waged by a coalition of dozens of @entity69 tea party groups , @entity267 of @entity69 had a simple message for his fellow activists : " you unite , you 'll change the world			1

@entity10 pursuing grassroots strategy that aims to build long - term organization
author : tea party movement becoming a *permanent* special interest group within the @entity58
@entity10 ceo : once activists become connected , you just have to " feed the machine "
@entity69 tea party activist : " you unite , you 'll change the world "
