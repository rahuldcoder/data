-- on some forgotten day in 2004 , @entity1 , a soot - colored volcano in @entity2 , was host to an unusual visitor			1
on the steep flank of the mountain , a man was bent low to the basalt scree , laboring upward			2
on his back teetered a small refrigerator , recently removed from a hotel minibar			1
@entity12 had a plan , and for someone intent on " riding " a fridge down the side of an active volcano , a great deal of optimism might be assumed too			1
what happened when @entity12 reached a suitably daring altitude , jumped aboard his fridge and set to his ambitious plummet is n't recorded , though he did survive to concoct more hair - brained schemes			1
nobody i 've met is sure about the fridge			2
perhaps it was n't sturdy enough for high - velocity volcano travel , or perhaps there was a disappointing , crawling end to the journey			1
undeterred , @entity12 's next experiment on @entity1 involved a mattress , and , later , his front door			1
perhaps because his home was getting a little breezy and running low on appliances , he eventually gathered some tools and wood and knocked up the world 's very first volcano board , later to belt down the same volcano with more success			1
unique conditions for fun almost a decade on and a successor to @entity12 's prototype is wedged under my arm as i plod through the sun - washed scrub beneath the cone of @entity1 , aka @entity55			1
ahead , a 20 - strong scrambling chain of fellow volcano boarders heading to the summit is a shock of orange against the dark basalt -- we 're all donned in convict - style luminous jump suits			1
as i clamber up ( the hike to the top takes about an hour ) , crunching the brittle rock formed by cooled lava under - boot , a thin breeze blunts the formidable heat			1
the sun is high , and the sky unmarred by clouds			0
it 's tough to think of a more dramatic place to play in , and it 's about to get more so			2
" check this out guys ! " hollers @entity76 , our dreadlocked guide from @entity79 , as she motions to a mass of pale rocks , beneath which steam leaks out into the thick air			0
not far beneath our feet , the world burns			2
@entity1 is a baby in geological terms , the youngest volcano , in fact , in all of @entity88 -- some boast in an area with such a fund of them			1
since its birth in 1850 it has erupted 23 times , the last in 1999 just before the sport of volcano boarding took hold			1
@entity76 reminds us that @entity55 does n't just appear menacing , it really is			0
this is probably the only place in the world you can book a tour to go volcano boarding			1
there are a few reports of people trying something similar in @entity112 , but the sport has n't taken hold there			2
neither too large nor too small for careering down ( roughly 1,500 feet from peak to base ) , the smooth , denuded conditions on @entity1 make it the ideal place for such madness			1
" to our knowledge , volcano boarding is only possible on @entity1 , " says @entity122 of the @entity124 tour company , which leads volcano boarding trips			1
" in parts of @entity131 , and other parts of the world , there is something called ' sand boarding , ' but this is nothing like volcano boarding			1
" because of the surface of the volcano and the weather conditions constant at this volcano , we are able to slide down at speeds up to 95 kph			1
" when the volcano erupts , the prevailing winds push all of the ash and small pebbles to one side of the volcano , while the actual eruption happens on the other side of the volcano causing a smooth surface on the west side of the volcano			1
" " three - two - one , go ! " we all eventually heave ourselves to the top of a ridge , which curves around to the launching point			0
to the east rise other peaks in the @entity162 volcanic chain , and beyond them , the @entity158 glimmers			0
a smudge , jet black , covers the eastern side of the mountain -- a cooled lava flow from the 1999 eruption -- while most of the surrounding land is a sultry and baked expanse , so hot it dances			0
the city of @entity174 is below too , the country 's largest after the capital , and launching point for tours like this by @entity124			1
from our vantage point , the angle of the slope looks too wild to be rideable , though @entity183 might argue otherwise			0
the @entity184 descended the slope on a bicycle in 2002 , achieving a world record of 172 kph on gravel , before wiping out and breaking , according to @entity76 , " pretty much everything you can break			1
" who 's up ? " @entity76 asks			2
our silence is fractured by a few nervous giggles then a girl strides forward to claim pole position , goggles up and sits down on the board , which is rectangular and made of plywood reinforced with @entity200 and with metal mounted on the bottom			0
there 's a rope to hold in your hands			2
variations on the theme are constructed by individual tour companies operating out of @entity174			1
instructions are terse and delivered by @entity76 with mock gravity : " elbows in , feet forward , good to go			0
" the girl and board crawl off with a sound of wood crunching rock , then momentum builds and she 's soon just a soft orange mote chased by a smoky scar , like a jet trail			2
" ready ? " " yep " " three - two - one , go ! " scattering gravel the board edges forward and scatters gravel , the world tilts downward , air whistles by			2
i realize early that i 'm close to sliding off , but i 'm too committed now so i do n't bother to brake by tapping my feet , and instead let the blurry landscape whip by with gathering pace			0
then , at what will prove my terminal velocity , the board slips sideways			0
@entity236 has little in common with other surfaces where you might encounter a board with a thrill - seeker on top -- snow and sand , for example			0
it 's hard , abrasive and plunging face down into it will spoil the rest of your vacation photos			2
i see the spill coming in plenty of time though , and i pull the volcano boarding equivalent of the ejector seat , hurling myself sideways			1
when i hit the hard stuff i 've managed to scrunch into a ball , and it only takes me a second to realize i have n't broken " everything you can break			0
" in fact , i 'm fine			0
i rejoin the board , take a second to drink in the vista from a new level , halfway down , and push off for a second time			0
speed records back at the truck i watch the others descend			0
a few crash , but nobody stays a crumpled heap or shouts in anything but elation			0
nearby i spot our driver wielding a police - style speed gun , and when we 're all reunited in the truck the top speeds are disclosed			2
" first place : @entity282 kmh			0
" i 'm first ! an @entity284 guy , who claims second place , looks crushed			0
i win a paltry orange wristband , but it 's the prestige that counts			2
it lasts until someone reminds us of the course record : 97 kmh ( 60 mph )			0
on the ride back to @entity174 i give silent thanks to the inspired people of the world : the ones whose minds run off on all manner of daring tangents , like the flanks of @entity1			1
the ones who admire not just the aesthetics of the wilds , but the possibilities too			0
and most of all the ones who stare up at active volcanoes and think : " i wonder if i could ride my fridge down that ? " volcano boarding can be booked through various local companies including @entity124 based in @entity174			1
cost of $ 29 includes transportation , safety equipment and board			0
park admission is an additional $ 5			0
tours run most days , year round , weather permitting			0
@entity318 is a @entity319 medical doctor and freelance writer specializing in adventure travel			0
he 's currently cycling across six of the earth 's continents and blogs at @entity325 .			2

tourist *daredevils* career down @entity2 's @entity1 on thin boards at speeds up to 95 kph
@entity1 is the world 's only " volcano boarding " venue
various small companies lead volcano boarding *excursions* out of the city of @entity174
the sport was invented in 2004 when @entity12 rode a small refrigerator down the hill
