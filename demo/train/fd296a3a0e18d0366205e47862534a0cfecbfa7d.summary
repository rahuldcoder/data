-- the unexpected resignation of @entity2 as head of the @entity4 must have come as a shock to many @entity6 , especially given his impeccable record as a distinguished military commander			1
but like the greatest heroes from @entity11 , it would appear that he was not exempt from the time - honored temptations of human folly and self - destruction			0
and now the plot is thickening , as details emerge that gen. @entity18 , the commander of @entity6 and @entity20 troops in @entity21 , is involved somehow in the scandal			0
as @entity6 are coming to terms with the revelation of @entity2 ' adultery , on the other side of the @entity29 , the feeling among the @entity24 can be summed up by a @entity31 © shrug			1
every time a steamy sexual intrigue is laid bare near the corridors of @entity35 power , the @entity24 do n't see what all the fuss is about			1
it 's only sex , after all			0
it 's impossible to imagine a @entity24 political leader resigning because of an extramarital indiscretion			1
if this rule were observed , the @entity24 parliament would be nearly vacant			2
the @entity2 affair : a lot more than sex the past five @entity24 presidents are known to have had at least one -- and in some cases , many more -- mistresses throughout their political career			1
the current resident of the @entity54 , @entity55 , has been caught in the middle of an embarrassing dispute between his previous and current female companions			0
the @entity24 , long used to regarding their leaders with cynical detachment , have been following this tormented domestic feud with interest and maybe some contempt			2
the details of @entity2 ' sexual dalliance with his own biographer , @entity67 , are unquestionably fascinating			2
still , the @entity24 like to consider themselves blithely indifferent to bedroom antics , even when those involved are married to other people			2
opinion : how @entity2 courted the press @entity72 , the intellectually self - important leftist newspaper , noted that the @entity2 affair quickly jumped from the pages of the respectable @entity75 to those of the gossipy tabloid @entity77			2
in other words , while the @entity2 scandal may indeed be a legitimate affair of state because of the sensitivity of his position at the summit of the @entity4 , what really interests @entity6 are the juicy details of the four - star army general 's sexual conquest			1
@entity24 bafflement at @entity91 prurience has a history -- from @entity94 's anteroom encounters with @entity96 intern @entity95 to the more recent misadventures of @entity98 and @entity99			1
all have ended with abject confessions			0
the @entity24 usually attribute this @entity91 ritual of guilt and contrition to " puritanism			1
" this is meant as a put - down and a mark of @entity24 cultural superiority			2
the @entity24 , by contrast , are mature and sophisticated , never shocked and titillated by the rich complexity of life 's temptations			1
@entity24 is a catholic society devoid of the puritanical guilt that is deeply embedded in the @entity91 psyche			1
the @entity24 draw a line between private and public vice , whereas in @entity6 and @entity119 , the distinction is blurred if not merged entirely			2
in @entity24 , a politician can betray his wife without being suspected of screwing voters			1
moreover , @entity24 journalists are not driven by the same " fourth estate " ethos that animates @entity91 media culture			1
@entity24 society in general has an ambiguous relationship with the truth , and @entity24 journalists are frequently indifferent to the exposure of hard facts			0
when the subject is the sexual indiscretion of politicians in high office , media indifference can be counted on because press and political circles in @entity140 are often intimated linked -- professionally , socially and sexually			0
hence the famous media " omerta " about the private lives of @entity24 politicians			1
this convenient arrangement reached a high point of hypocritical disregard for the truth during the presidency of @entity150 , when the @entity24 media kept the secret of his double life -- including an illegitimate daughter living in an official residence at taxpayers ' expense -- for nearly two decades			0
everyone knew about it , nobody wrote about it			0
opinion : how @entity2 changed the @entity6 military the shocking conduct of @entity165 shattered this longstanding media omerta			0
but @entity24 journalists are still reluctant to probe too aggressively into the private lives of politicians			1
in @entity24 , there are strict laws that make privacy invasion illegal and punishable			0
only last month , @entity165 , though disgraced and banished from @entity24 politics , sued a magazine for publishing a photo of him and his new girlfriend			0
and he won damages in court			0
as the eye - popping details of @entity2 ' complex personal life emerge in the @entity91 media , do n't expect the @entity24 to respond with disbelief			1
they will claim they do n't really want to know			0
when it happens in @entity24 , they are often never told			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity191 : the @entity24 do n't see what 's all the fuss is in the @entity2 scandal
@entity191 : it 's impossible to imagine a @entity24 leader resigning because of adultery
he says the @entity24 are baffled at @entity91 prurience and " puritanism "
@entity191 : in @entity24 , politicians can betray spouse without being suspected of screwing voters
