-- when @entity2 was formally introduced to @entity3 in the @entity4 beside the president , he was startling to see and hear at first : he was wearing a long beard and even speaking @entity7			1
the transformation of the former @entity10 delivery man was five years in the making in the mountain valleys of @entity13 , sparked when his son , @entity15 sgt. @entity14 , was captured by the @entity16 in @entity17 in june 2009			1
in the half - decade that he and wife crusaded for their son 's release -- finally won this past weekend -- @entity2 journeyed deep into the meaning of his son 's captivity and war itself , according to media accounts			1
he immersed himself in books about @entity17 and its @entity7 language , to speak to his son 's captors if only from afar			1
when it was over , he emerged as someone apparently transformed by his odyssey to save his son			0
" i am your father , @entity2			1
to the people of @entity17 , the same , " @entity2 said during the @entity4 announcement of his son 's release			1
his immersion into the @entity17 mindset , however , has n't gone unquestioned			1
his @entity44 account posted a message expressing his intent to help free prisoners at @entity48			0
@entity14 's release was secured after the @entity51 administration traded five terrorism detainees from @entity48 in exchange for the @entity3 soldier , which @entity56 leaders and others have criticized as negotiating with terrorists			1
does @entity2 swap set precedent ? the tweet on may 28 was subsequently deleted			2
a military spokesman for the family , col. @entity63 , told @entity0 that the @entity65 had no comment on the tweet and would not confirm or deny its authenticity			0
@entity0 has no way of independently confirming the authenticity of the tweet			0
back in @entity71 , @entity13 , where the @entity65 raised and home - schooled their son and daughter , residents strongly support the family and dismiss the anger over the prisoner exchange			1
the community has long maintained a yellow - ribbon vigil for the return of @entity14			2
" i think that people need to take a little bit more time to stop and listen and understand the situation before they make snap judgments , " said @entity81 , 55 , a caregiver and artist who has been living in @entity71 for 15 years			0
in the past five years , @entity2 and @entity89 have been holding rallies , maintaining a website and lobbying congressmen in a campaign to win their son 's freedom			1
in may 2011 , almost two years into his son 's captivity , @entity2 made a @entity99 appeal to his son 's captors			1
the father had a long beard , but he did n't speak much @entity7 at that time : " we ask that your nation diligently help our son be freed from his captivity			1
i pray this video may be shown to our only son , " he told @entity111 armed forces , apparently because his son 's captors were moving him between @entity17 and @entity111 at that time			1
" we 've been quiet in public , but we have n't been quiet behind the scenes , " as recently as last january , @entity2 also spoke @entity7 at a rally in @entity71			1
" may the peace of @entity119 and blessings of @entity119 be upon you , " he said in @entity7			2
" after 12 years , let there be peace			0
can we push this forward and make this happen ? " @entity2 then spoke in @entity126 , delivering a message to his only son that revealed a mutual trial of the spirit			1
" @entity2 , my son , if you can hear me ... you are part of the peace process			1
you are part of ending the @entity17 war			1
tell the truth , and have the patience that can only come from @entity119			0
" @entity2 , 54 , who retired from @entity10 after working there for 28 years , recently built a campsite with a tent and a wood - burning stove in the same birch forest in the mountains where his son used to play as a child , according to a recent videotaped interview with the @entity152 's @entity151 newspaper			1
to reach the campsite , @entity2 hiked in snowshoes with a backpack through the wintry summits			2
he 's hoping his son will use the isolation of the camp to recover			0
" i wake up each morning , and my first thought is , my son is still a prisoner of war in @entity17 , and i need to do something about that , " the father told the @entity151			1
back at home , the family kitchen features a small shrine to their son , with a framed photograph of him in uniform along with a @entity3 flag			0
elsewhere in the home are stacks of books including one entitled " @entity7 " and another called " war is a lie , " according to the @entity151			2
" i 'm trying to learn a little @entity7 so that i can speak to people , " he said in the newspaper interview			2
" i 'm trying to write or read the language			0
i probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history			0
" @entity183 , a @entity2 family friend , said those are the thoughts of a father fighting for his son 's life			1
" would n't you try and connect with the people that had your child ? @entity2 and @entity89 did everything possible they could to ensure @entity2 's safety			2
and if @entity2 was trying to connect with them , it was to keep his son safe , i 'm sure , " @entity183 said			2
the family home sits high in the crystalline air of the @entity200 down the road from the resort town of @entity203 , a famous tourist and celebrity getaway for skiing and fresh air			0
outside the house , @entity2 rides a quarterhorse in the snow without a saddle			0
" i do n't think anybody can relate to the prisoners in @entity48 more -- i do n't think -- than our family because it 's the same thing			0
my son is a prisoner of war , and wars end with reconciliation and negotiations with the enemy , and prisoners of war should be part of that dialogue , and i insist that it will be , " @entity2 told the @entity152 news outlet			1
@entity14 was officially classified by the military as missing / captured			0
@entity2 taught his son ethics from the classics			2
he and his wife moved to @entity13 from @entity233 and built a two - bedroom house on mountain valley farmland near @entity71 , the family told @entity237 magazine in 2012			0
there , the couple raised @entity2 and daughter @entity240			2
the parents are devout calvinists who home - schooled their children six hours a day and taught them the theologies of @entity246 and @entity247			0
" ethics and morality would be constant verbiage in our conversations , " @entity2 told the magazine			0
" @entity2 was definitely instilled with truth			0
he was very philosophical about perceiving ethics			0
" his son 's upbringing in mountainous @entity71 may have helped the young man during captivity , @entity2 told @entity259 in an interview two years ago			1
" @entity13 is so much like @entity17 , " @entity2 told the magazine , citing the mountains of both			1
" the similarities will help him			0
we hope that will be what sustains him			0
" it apparently did , though the captivity has taken a toll on the son , the father said			0
his son , too , became immersed in the language of his captors and now has trouble speaking @entity126			0
the son 's recovery will certainly take a long time , the father said			1
@entity14 's return to the @entity3 -- and reunion with his family and hometown -- have not been announced by @entity3 officials			2
opinion : @entity2 still has a hard road home @entity0 's @entity286 and @entity287 contributed to this report from @entity13 .			2

@entity2 , father of sgt. @entity14 , grew a beard like an @entity17 *villager* 's
he learned @entity7 to speak to his son 's captors from afar
each morning , " my first thought is , my son is still a prisoner of war , " he tells outlet
his immersion into the @entity17 mindset , however , has raised questions
