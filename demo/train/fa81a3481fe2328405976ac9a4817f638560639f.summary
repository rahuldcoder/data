-- @entity1 says he will beat @entity2 -- " no doubt " -- but do n't expect him to dance around the gym , making it rain and running his mouth about it			1
it 's not how he rolls			0
unlike his opponent in saturday 's @entity11 super-welterweight title fight , @entity1 does n't resort to third - person , braggadocio - packed soliloquies when a reporter asks a question			1
" i 'm ready and prepared for anything he can bring to me the night of may 5 , " @entity1 said of @entity2			1
@entity1 has trained his trunks off and all the @entity2 jawing in the world ca n't get into his head			1
" those guys ca n't penetrate our minds , " he said			0
@entity26 , which is airing the fight on pay - per - view , has used its prefight coverage to paint the men as entirely different species ahead of their bout in @entity33			2
it 's @entity35 vs. @entity36 , inconspicuous vs. flamboyant , custom @entity37 vs. @entity38 , wife and kids vs. @entity41			0
and if not for a segment showing @entity2 running a @entity43 for charity and cutting a six - figure check to @entity46 , good vs. evil			2
and let 's not forget their purses : @entity51 reported $ 8 million for @entity1 and $ 35 million for the man appropriately known as @entity53			2
where @entity1 says he does n't want to dictate how history remembers him , @entity2 demands to author his own legacy			1
when @entity26 's third installment of the behind - the - scenes " 24/7 " aired last week , @entity2 tweeted that he did n't like it , apologized to fans and called for @entity26 to replace the producer			2
even the fighters ' styles are at odds , with @entity1 employing a more aggressive technique that can resemble brawling when his opponent forces it			2
@entity2 prefers to size up his opponent and rely on footwork , defense , counterpunching and @entity73 - like accuracy			2
@entity74 , a boxing analyst and commentator for @entity26 , which like @entity0 is owned by @entity76 , said their styles have evolved in recent years and he sees @entity2 today as a " consistent , thudding puncher " who relies less on the ropes and the ring 's perimeter and more on a high guard and his ability to " walk down " or pressure his opponent			0
@entity1 , on the other hand , is not the all - out brawler he 's sometimes made out to be			1
he 's a deft puncher and he 's aggressive , but do n't expect him to go blow for blow with @entity2			2
" he 's looking to inflict damage , but he 's not like a wild , face - first brawler , " @entity74 said			0
former four - division champ @entity94 said he would n't be surprised to see @entity2 chase @entity1 around the ring			1
he said that if @entity1 is to win against a smaller , quicker @entity2 , he is going to have to " change the game , " something he has n't seen @entity99 do since his 2007 @entity11 welterweight title bout with " @entity102 " @entity101			1
in that fight , @entity1 used his jab to neutralize @entity101 's speed			2
he moved around a lot so @entity101 could n't settle down , and he took a lot of punches ( 248 , to be exact ) to set up his own attack			0
he 'll need to do the same with @entity2 to slow him down and change the fight 's rhythm			1
@entity1 will also need to take some punches , something @entity94 is n't sure he 's ready to do			1
" they 're not the most devastating punches , but at the same time , ( @entity1 's ) still got to take them , " he said , adding with skepticism , " he 's not going to stay and take no punches to get his attack in			0
" @entity94 was also concerned about some of the statements coming from @entity2 , a notorious prefight smack talker			1
in a recent appearance on @entity74 's @entity26 show , @entity2 called @entity1 " solid " and " one of the best fighters out there			1
" he went on to say he viewed @entity99 as " an undefeated fighter			0
" " you do n't hear him talk like that till after the fight , " @entity94 said , speculating that @entity2 may feel @entity1 lacks confidence or can be easily outclassed			1
" @entity1 has lost twice in his professional career , once against eight - division champion @entity136 , in which @entity136 made @entity1 drop weight , and another against @entity139 , who was suspended for a year after a subsequent fight against @entity101 when officials found plaster in his hand wraps			1
those circumstances are what prompted @entity2 's remark that @entity1 was undefeated			1
many in the boxing world , including @entity1 and @entity94 , believe @entity139 cheated when he fought cotto the first time in 2008			1
@entity1 , who defeated @entity139 in last year 's rematch , said his evidence was simple : " all the swelling in my face in the first fight did not even compare with how good , how healthy i looked on december 3			2
" @entity1 himself blew off @entity2 's " undefeated " remark , saying the losses made him a more mature fighter			1
" if it were n't for those defeats , i would n't be this person , " he said			0
the reigning @entity11 super-welterweight superchamp also dismissed comparisons of his and @entity2 's performances against common opponents			0
the pair have each fought @entity101 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			0
they earned unanimous decisions against @entity101 , and @entity1 won by technical knockout in the other four fights			0
@entity2 knocked out only @entity169 , winning by unanimous decision in the other three			0
on their face , those outcomes would seem to favor @entity1 , but the pugilist flatly stated , " every fight 's different ... the fighters we have in common does n't mean anything			2
" it 's an assertion with which @entity94 and @entity74 concurred			0
despite @entity2 being a heavy favorite , @entity1 's close friend and manager , @entity188 , told @entity190 last month that @entity99 had devised a " blueprint " for beating @entity2 and that he had n't seen cotto this motivated in " many , many fights			1
" " i trained a lot			0
i make my training the right training to beat @entity2 , " @entity1 added tuesday			1
@entity1 will need something special if he 's to hand @entity2 his first loss , @entity74 said			1
unlike many champs before him , @entity2 never takes an opponent lightly , and " he has never shown up in less than top - notch condition			2
" despite the sideshows surrounding @entity2 , which include a domestic violence plea that will land him in jail for 90 days beginning next month , the @entity201 's mantra has always been " hard work and dedication , " and it pays off , @entity74 said			0
the analyst pointed to the once - invincible @entity209 , who successfully defended his heavyweight title only nine times before @entity212 , a 42 - to - 1 underdog , clocked him in the 10th round , leaving @entity209 scrounging for his mouthpiece			0
former middleweight champ " marvelous " @entity216 said it best , according to @entity74 : " it is n't easy to get up at 6:30 on a bitterly cold morning for road work when you 're wearing silk pajamas			0
" @entity74 said he expects a good fight			0
he felt the odds of a @entity1 win , which reached as high as 7 - to - 1 ( they were 9 - to - 2 as of friday morning ) , were a little long but that " @entity2 is correctly the substantial favorite			1
" @entity94 had less confidence in @entity1 's chances , especially if he does n't alter his technique			1
he predicted it will be a close fight for about five rounds before @entity2 starts wearing his opponent down			2
@entity1 , of course , does n't care what the bookmakers or commentators think			0
he 's known he was the underdog since he began training in march , and he 's unfazed , he said			0
" i 'm going for victory , " he said			0
" i have no doubt i 'm going to be the winner			0

@entity243 will pit aggressive @entity1 against fleet - footed @entity2
@entity99 says boxer has " blueprint " to hand @entity2 first loss
former champ @entity94 skeptical , says @entity1 will have to change style
@entity2 *uncharacteristically* *heaping* *praise* on @entity1 before fight
