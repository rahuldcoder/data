-- when was the last time you heard someone say it 's important to hire a qualified white person for a job ? no , seriously , i really want you to think about that question			2
whenever there is a discussion about diversity , inclusion or affirmative action , we always hear folks say , " we do a great job of trying to find qualified minorities			0
" that always tickles me , because when it comes to hiring whites , the assumption is that all are qualified , so there 's no need for the qualifier " qualified			1
" that was the first thing that came to mind when former @entity29 gov. @entity28 gave his opinion on " @entity31 " on thursday regarding gen. @entity33 's endorsement of president @entity34			1
@entity35 : @entity28 's comment was ' unfortunate ' " frankly , when you take a look at @entity33 , you have to wonder whether that 's an endorsement based on issues or whether he 's got a slightly different reason for preferring president @entity34 , " @entity28 said			1
when @entity44 asked him what that reason is , @entity28 said , " well , i think when you have somebody of your own race that you 're proud of being president of the @entity50 , i applaud @entity33 for standing with him			1
" oh , @entity28 , you 're such a charmer to say you applaud @entity33 for being a righteous brother and supporting his brother from another mother			1
all i could do was laugh at how incredibly stupid and asinine @entity28 's remark was			1
but @entity28 is n't alone			1
he 's like the many idiots who have e-mailed and tweeted me over the years , suggesting that comments perceived as favorable to @entity34 boil down to our skin color			1
accomplishments ? oh , no. intellect ? forget about it			0
it 's always a black thing			1
news : @entity34 and the white vote see , i 'm not one of these black folks who are quick to deny that anyone voted for @entity34 because he 's black			1
actor @entity72 has made it clear that he backs @entity34 because he 's black , and he does n't give a damn what any white person thinks			1
but it really is @entity78 's responsibility to tell us exactly why he supports the president			2
it 's not our job to automatically assume that skin color is the reason during this season			1
for instance , in 2004 , the rev. @entity86 ran for president of the @entity50			0
now , we know he 's black , but a ton of black folks did n't even think of supporting him during his run or send him a dime			1
i recall betting a black @entity96 media executive a big steak dinner that @entity86 would not win the primary in @entity99 , where nearly half of the voters are black			2
he was adamant it would happen , citing the rev. @entity104 's win there in 1988			2
during that same primary , former @entity50 sen. @entity106 also ran for the @entity109 nomination			0
her campaign was about as ineffectual as @entity86 's , and few people , even black folks , backed her			1
opinion : why is n't @entity33 a @entity113 ? amazing			1
two black folks running for president -- one a prominent civil rights activist and the other a former @entity50 senator -- and black @entity50 as a whole did n't even give their candidacies a thought			2
so if in @entity28 's mind a @entity33 endorsement comes down to race , how does he explain the many times a black candidate runs for office , and black support is n't guaranteed ? what about all of the years black folks voted for white candidates ? was one whiter than the other ? since @entity28 thinks it 's about race , i need him to explain to me how @entity136 's whiteness has been the deciding factor behind his being a major surrogate for the @entity136 campaign			1
please tell us , @entity28 , why you think @entity136 is the @entity142 who will take down soul brother no. 1 at 1600 @entity145 turnabout is fair play , right ? if @entity33 is backing @entity34 because he 's black , i need all of @entity136 's white supporters who are backing him because of the color of his skin to step forward			1
please , do n't hold back			0
@entity33 is an @entity50 hero			2
he has served as national security adviser , head of the @entity153 , chairman of the @entity154 , secretary of state			0
opinion : both parties have a huge race problem as a distinguished military man who has worked for four @entity50 presidents , he has witnessed up close and personal what it takes to be president of the @entity50 and commander in chief			2
it is ridiculous to assume @entity33 would be so shallow as to think race is the only determinant for him			1
the suggestion is beneath him			0
so , why did @entity28 say it ? because it 's easy to dismiss an accomplished black man who just praised another accomplished black man			1
by boiling it down to race , it 's easy for others who think such a thing to say , " oh , that 's it ! " unfortunately , we see this type of thinking in @entity50 all of the time			2
i crack up when someone white e-mails me , saying i owe my job to affirmative action			0
their bigotry and racial animus is obvious , and i e-mail them back saying , i 'm laughing at them			0
why ? because it must hurt more to have a black man they ca n't stand laugh at them			0
my accomplishments are clear and many			0
i owe no one an explanation for my success , and @entity33 owes @entity28 and no one else an explanation other that what he said on @entity202 's morning show , citing @entity136 's confusing foreign policy views and @entity34 's steady leadership			1
" when he took over , the country was in very , very difficult straits			0
we were in one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times , close to a depression , " @entity33 said			2
" we were in real trouble			0
" i saw over the next several years stabilization come back in the financial community			0
@entity217 is now starting to pick up after four years			0
it 's starting to pick up			0
so i think generally , we 've come out of the dive , and we 're starting to gain altitude			0
it does n't mean we are problem solved			0
there are lots of problems still out there			0
the unemployment rate is too high			0
people are still hurting in housing			0
but i see that we are starting to rise up			0
" @entity233 n't nothing like a critically thinking brother , right , @entity28 ? this issue will not get a rise out of president @entity34 or gen. @entity33			1
they wo n't even dignify @entity28 and others who think like them			2
they 'll just keep laughing all the way up the ladder to the next successful step , marveling at the childishness of some whites to reduce black support of another @entity249 to just the color of their skin and not the content of their character			1
the opinions expressed in this country are solely those of @entity258 .			2

@entity258 : @entity28 said @entity33 backed @entity34 because he is black
he says it 's asinine to say race motivates blacks ' endorsements rather than accomplishment
he wants @entity267 to explain how @entity136 's whiteness earned his support
@entity258 : it 's childish for some whites to reduce black support to skin color , not character
