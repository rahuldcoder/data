@entity0 , @entity1 -- a member of @entity7 's wing in @entity8 intent on staging an attack was arrested in @entity4 earlier this year , the @entity4 home secretary said wednesday			1
@entity11 disclosed the development in a wide - ranging address on counter-terrorism , in which she discussed threats of violence and approaches to fighting them			1
" our police and agencies have been working to disrupt @entity20 operatives in this country , " she said , making reference to @entity20			1
" an @entity20 associate was arrested here earlier this year			1
he is alleged to have been planning a terrorist attack in this country			1
threats such as these are likely to continue			1
" officials believe that @entity20 is behind the recent plot to send bombs from @entity8 to the @entity33			1
the group is based in @entity8 , which has emerged as a major operating base for @entity7 and other terror groups			1
may noted that " one of the devices was intercepted and made safe here			1
" she said in the wake of that incident , @entity4 ordered the suspension of air freight from @entity8 and other actions , such as the " suspension of unaccompanied air freight from @entity47			1
" " the specifics of this attack -- notably the type of device and how it was concealed -- were new to us			1
the principle of the attack -- a device placed in unaccompanied baggage -- was not			1
it bears some resemblance to the attack on @entity60 103 over @entity61 in 1988			2
" she said last week 's incident showed " beyond doubt " that " we will continue to face a threat from international terrorism for the foreseeable future			1
" that threat is now more diverse and more fragmented than ever before , " said may , who emphasized that " public policy must respond to this changing threat			2
" may said that last month the government came out with a national security strategy that said terror from @entity79 and in the international realm " remain two of the highest risks our country faces			1
" she pointed out that an explosive device intended to cause civilian casualties was found saturday in a car at the @entity86 airport			2
" it is testimony to the success of the police and the agencies that we have not had a successful attack in this country since 2007 and there have been no casualties since 2005			2
but as we saw last week , the absence of an attack does not mean an absence of threat			2
" she says @entity7 is weaker but still remains dangerous			2
" we should neither overstate the strength and significance of @entity7 , nor underestimate its continuing capability , " she said			2
may cited the dangers of @entity107 , the militant group in @entity47 " just across the @entity108 from @entity8			2
" that group " has developed links to @entity7 and , we assess , to @entity20			0
it thrives in a failed state			0
it has aspirations beyond @entity47 borders			0
" she also mentions the @entity118 group @entity7 in the @entity119 , which has resorted to kidnapping			0
" we do not believe the group yet has the capability to carry out a terrorist attack on @entity4 soil , but i do n't doubt that would be their aspiration			0
" she said there has been an emergence of a " more diverse and devolved terrorist threat " that lacks a " strong , directive and commanding center and ( is ) joined more by ideology than hierarchy			0
" " the attempted attack in @entity135 by the @entity137 @entity136 perfectly illustrates the challenge we face , " referring to a failed attempt to set off a bomb in @entity141 's @entity135			0
may cited the " new and deadly method of attack " utilized by @entity145 - e @entity144 in the november 2008 @entity147 strike			0
" these attacks were conducted by terrorists with assault rifles , handguns and improvised explosive devices			0
the attackers also used off - the - shelf technology -- satellite guidance and encrypted communications -- which you can buy across the counter anywhere in the world			0
" we can not assume that such an attack would be replicated exactly here , but we must plan for the possibility of a terrorist firearms attack in this country			0
" may also stressed the importance of balancing liberty and safety			0
" we want to ensure that where powers are intrusive they are proportionate to the threat , necessary to reduce it to a level which we judge acceptable , and effective			0
these criteria -- proportionality , necessity and impact -- are vital			0
" she said it is important to tackle the causes of terror , such as some social and economic factors			1
" we need a new approach to our engagement with @entity4 's @entity186 communities -- one that helps to create the integrated society that we need			0
" we will stop talking to @entity186 communities only about counter-terrorism , and start treating them like the mature and integral parts of society that they are			1
" she also emphasized that success in domestic counter-terror requires " international cooperation and collaboration overseas			0
