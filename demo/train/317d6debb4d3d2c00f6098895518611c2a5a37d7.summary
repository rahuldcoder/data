they know @entity2 tanks would make short work of their ramshackle defenses and shallow trenches			1
but with @entity8 and @entity9 shrinking from the fight , this rag - tag band of civilian volunteers know they could be the first , last and only line of defense if @entity13 rolls into this corner of northeast @entity15			1
" we ca n't expect help from anybody else			0
our own government is too passive			0
but hopefully we can rely on support from ordinary @entity15 , " @entity20 told @entity21 on a blustery morning close to the @entity15 border village of @entity23			1
in more peaceful times , @entity20 runs a farm supplies company			0
now , with @entity2 estimated to be massing up to 88,000 troops just across the border from @entity15 's eastern frontier , he finds himself marshaling a newly formed self - defense committee			1
they 're setting up an outpost along the highway that cuts from the @entity15 - @entity2 border to the @entity15 's interior			1
@entity36 pulls out of presidential race he and his closest aides , @entity39 and @entity40 , are clad in @entity42 - issue uniforms from the @entity44 " campaign			0
they still bear the @entity47 insignia on the left sleeve			0
" we picked them up at the bazaar			0
i 've no idea how they got there			0
including my boots , i paid around 100 euros , " @entity20 said			0
other members of his self - defense unit are sporting surplus combat jackets and pants from other @entity9 militaries			0
all of the volunteers say they have some army training from time spent doing military service			1
@entity20 said they 've also been getting refresher courses from friendly @entity15 army officers in recent days			1
two members of the group claim -- like an unspecified number of other @entity15 nationalists -- to have fought alongside @entity74 insurgents against the @entity2 in @entity75			1
best hope is to slow any advance but if the @entity2 roll into eastern @entity15 , it will be very different from the house - to - house urban combat that has previously taken place in the @entity75 capital of @entity84			1
this region is home to sweeping expanses of farmland and scattered forests , classic terrain for a tank war -- the kind of scenario both @entity94 and @entity96 forces drilled for during the @entity97 years			0
fedorok and his patriots have encircled their dilapidated outpost with piles of old car tires			0
the plan : if the @entity2 stream down the highway en route to the district capital @entity108 , they 'll burn rubber and set up a smokescreen			2
they say they have no real weapons , but this band of brothers has made up a stash of @entity118 cocktails , with rags stuffed into old vodka bottles			2
the few yards of trenches that stretch into a nearby tree line are only a fallback position , and hardly constitute a sturdy defensive line			0
" as much as anything else , we 're put here making a political point			0
we know this outpost is only an effort to slow down the @entity2 , " @entity20 said matter - of - factly			2
" i should n't be telling you this but our plan is to break down into five - man units and we will launch a guerrilla - style partisan war against the @entity2 , " he added , declining to specify how many volunteers he has under his command			1
but these paramilitary militias may not be entirely alone			0
@entity20 drives a few kilometers up the highway closer to the border to introduce us to a detachment of @entity15 soldiers			1
for now , they 're coordinating operations			0
a fresh - faced army major with a @entity2 - made @entity147 assault rifle slung over his shoulder told us his men are on high alert			2
" these are military times , " he said as he showed us a little of his hardware : three armored personnel carriers mounted with heavy - machine guns , dug into the earth and camouflaged with branches from birch trees			0
a few yards away stood a @entity2 - made t - 80 tank			2
the major said there were more tanks half buried behind berms in the forest			0
' looking toward our brothers ' all the vehicles are pointing toward a bridge			0
the major , who declined to give his name , said the order was to defend the bridge or blow it up if the @entity2 advanced across the border			1
but unlike the civilian self - defense militias , these soldiers seem a little unsure when i asked whether they would really stand and battle the @entity2			2
in @entity15 's @entity178 , the @entity15 army confined itself to barracks or surrendered			2
earlier this week , the @entity180 in @entity181 said a full 75 percent of its force in @entity178 either defected or simply went @entity184 when the @entity2 moved in			2
here at the eastern border , the major in charge of this armored detachment shook his head slowly			2
" i prefer to say that we are not pointing our tanks at the @entity2 but merely looking toward our brothers in case they advance in friendship , " he said			1
the major said he could scarcely believe he was on high alert to battle troops from @entity13			1
" we trained in the same military academies during @entity94 times and after that			0
we see them as our brothers , " he said			0
the @entity203 's latest figures put the number of @entity2 troops massing just over the border at about 40,000			1
the @entity15 government 's @entity208 and @entity207 estimates the figure at 88,000 , but that estimate may include units a little farther from the border region that could be deployed as a second wave in the event of an invasion			1
@entity13 has insisted it is only carrying out drills			1
and in televised comments saturday , @entity2 foreign minister @entity218 insisted his forces had no intention of crossing into @entity15			1
however , in a telephone conversation with president @entity224 friday night , @entity2 president @entity222 once again reportedly raised concerns about ethnic @entity2 living in eastern @entity15			1
he suggested @entity15 ultra-nationalists had been threatening ethnic @entity2 and driving them out of their homes and businesses -- the same accusations that @entity13 used as a pretext to intervene in @entity178			1
standing tall and surveying his trench lines , self - defense commander @entity20 was in no mood to listen to any assurances from @entity13			2
he said he was in no doubt : " the @entity2 hordes are coming			2
" @entity178 's military dolphins " to switch nationalities " opinion : is @entity224 weak against @entity222 ? @entity239 -- protest heart , crime scene , political stage			0

tens of thousands of @entity2 troops amass on border with eastern @entity15
band of *overmatched* @entity15 volunteers has vowed to fight any @entity2 advance
@entity13 insists it is only conducting military drills , but has *pledged* to protect ethnic @entity2
