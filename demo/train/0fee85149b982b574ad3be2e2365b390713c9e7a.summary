-- at my heaviest , i weighed 385 pounds			1
i never dared to dream i could run anywhere , never mind finish a half marathon			1
yet on april 27 , 2013 , i weighed 219 pounds			1
at 3:30 a.m. , i ate breakfast , hydrated , laced up my shoes and headed to @entity7 in @entity8 , because i was running the @entity9			1
it had taken a village to get me to this day			2
this run was for @entity13 , my best friend since college and her partner @entity14 , the two people that have taught me about the best me i can be			2
it was for @entity19 , the running group that became like family to me			2
it was for april , my @entity23 trainer			1
the 13.1 miles i was about to run were n't about the race itself , but about everything -- and everyone -- it took to get me there			2
behind the scenes : training for a triathlon @entity14 is the biggest reason i 've been able to lose more than 150 pounds			1
she became my trainer last june , then became one my biggest inspirations			1
in november 2012 @entity14 was diagnosed with uterine cancer			1
she and i had been working on getting me to my goal weight , which is how we decided to run a 5k and a half marathon in 2013			2
the plan was to do them together			2
i will never forget how scared i was , the anger i felt or the tears i cried , the day i heard her say , " i have cancer			1
" with a cancer diagnosis , @entity14 and @entity13 should 've been thinking about anything except me , but that 's not the kind of hearts they have			1
both were worried about how this was going to affect the plans @entity14 and i had made			2
so @entity13 stepped in with her " i got this " swagger and picked up where @entity14 was forced leave off			2
i still wonder how she did it sometimes			2
she would work out with me , work endlessly , go to all of @entity14 's doctor appointments and take care of everything at home			1
i know she was terrified , but never once did she complain			2
she 's a true testament to the human spirit			1
@entity14 's doctor decided she needed a complete hysterectomy , with possible radiation and / or chemo to follow , depending on what the surgery uncovered			1
surgery was set for december 26			0
while @entity14 was in surgery , i was in the waiting room with @entity13			0
believe it or not , that was the same day i did my first phone interview for @entity23			0
when @entity14 woke up from surgery , the first thing she said to me was , " did you talk to @entity0 ? " i was now training for two races			0
@entity83 , my @entity19 running coach , made sure april got my full running training plan			0
april then built the half training into my triathlon training			0
some days it was a bit overwhelming , but i was the one who wanted this			0
i knew what i had to do , so i stuck to the plan and kept running			0
while i was training , @entity14 was undergoing five weeks of radiation therapy			0
on april 13 , i had my first true " runner 's high			1
" i had 12 miles to run , my longest distance before the half			0
the group was small that day so one of the coaches decided to run with me			0
we like to talk so we kept the pace conversational			0
out of that run came a favorite phrase of mine : " what 's the bigger beach ? " you do n't need the story behind it to understand what it means			1
it 's asking whether you 'll go for instant gratification or plan , sacrifice and work on the best possible outcome for the long run			1
i finished the run so inspired , feeling as if i could run another 12 miles			0
get fit and others will follow on april 27 , just two days before @entity14 's final radiation treatment , @entity13 , @entity14 and i ran across the finish line of the @entity9 hand - in - hand			1
we were freezing and completely soaked from the rain			0
all i could do was cry as they both wrapped their arms around me jumping and screaming , " you did it ! " no , i did n't do it , i thought			0
we did it ! when i placed that half marathon medal around my neck , i knew it had all been worth it			0
i had made it to the " bigger beach			0
" every time i see the medal now , i see the village it took to earn it			0
most importantly , when i see the medal , i see me living			0
