-- in an op - ed column released friday by @entity3 , @entity1 blames @entity5 's malevolence over their breakup for a two - decade - old false accusation that he molested their adopted daughter , @entity11 , when she was 7			1
the film director 's opinion piece follows renewed allegations that were made last week by @entity15 , who accused him in an open letter published by the @entity3 of sexually assaulting her as young girl			2
" not that i doubt @entity11 has n't come to believe she 's been molested , but if from the age of 7 a vulnerable child is taught by a strong mother to hate her father because he is a monster who abused her , is it so inconceivable that after many years of this indoctrination the image of me @entity5 wanted to establish had taken root ? " @entity1 writes in the @entity3			1
@entity15 stood by her accusations in a statement responding to @entity1 's op - ed. " once again , @entity1 is attacking me and my family in an effort to discredit and silence me -- but nothing he says or writes can change the truth , " she said			1
" for 20 years , i have never wavered in describing what he did to me			0
i will carry the memories of surviving these experiences for the rest of my life			0
" the controversy dates back to 1992 after the revelation that @entity1 , then 56 , was having an affair with soon - @entity48 , @entity5 's 19 - year - old adopted daughter with composer @entity49			1
@entity1 and soon - @entity48 married five years later			1
relatives take @entity1 's side when @entity5 's 12 - year relationship with @entity1 ended , the actress accused him of molesting @entity11 , one of two children she had adopted with @entity1			1
" twenty - one years ago , when i first heard @entity5 had accused me of child molestation , i found the idea so ludicrous i did n't give it a second thought			2
we were involved in a terribly acrimonious breakup , with great enmity between us and a custody battle slowly gathering energy , " @entity1 wrote			2
" the self - serving transparency of her malevolence seemed so obvious i did n't even hire a lawyer to defend myself			0
it was my show business attorney who told me she was bringing the accusation to the police and i would need a criminal lawyer			0
" the charge triggered a child - custody battle , with @entity1 going to court to get both adopted children and @entity77 , their biological son , who now goes by @entity78			2
but a police investigation of the allegations ended with no charges against @entity1			0
at the time , @entity1 lashed out at authorities who handled the case and accused prosecutors of scheming to keep it open to influence his custody battle			0
adopted daughter says @entity1 sexually assaulted her even as the decades passed , the scandal permanently damaged @entity1 's image -- that of a neurotic but amusing schlub with a talent for slapstick and witty one - liners			1
he denied the accusations from @entity11 and said his relationship with @entity5 , which had been painted in storybook colors by the press , was not actually all that strong			1
however , the scandal has always been near the surface , and the open letter in the @entity3 is one of a number of instances in recent months where the allegation has been raised			0
he did marry soon - @entity48 in 1997 , and after the marriage came a slightly more public @entity1			1
the couple were the focus of a 1997 @entity110 documentary , " @entity112 , " which portrayed a generally happy pair			0
@entity1 was also the subject of a 2011 @entity115 film , " @entity1 : a documentary , " which briskly addressed @entity5 's allegations from @entity1 's point of view			1
in her open letter , @entity15 admonished actors by name for " turning a blind eye " and for continuing to work with @entity1			2
but in the opinion piece , @entity1 questioned whether @entity15 wrote the letter of her own accord or was guided by her mother in writing the letter			2
" does the letter really benefit @entity11 or does it simply advance her mother 's shabby agenda ? that is to hurt me with a smear			0
there is even a lame attempt to do professional damage by trying to involve movie stars , which smells a lot more like @entity5 , " @entity1 wrote			2
in a november @entity143 article , @entity1 was condemned by @entity5 's children , especially dylan			1
after that article 's publication , a representative for @entity1 told @entity0 , " the article is so fictitious and extravagantly absurd that he is not going to comment			0
" the article , @entity15 's letter and @entity153 postings by @entity78 attacking his estranged father come as the 78 - year - old director and his latest film -- " @entity157 " -- are up for honors during @entity160 's annual award season			1
when the @entity162 gave @entity1 a lifetime achievement award at the @entity164 last month , his son tweeted : " missed the @entity1 tribute -- did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after @entity171 ? " @entity15 's letter appeared in @entity3 columnist @entity173 's blog just hours before the @entity175 ceremony , for which @entity1 had been nominated for best screenplay for " @entity157			1
" he did not win			0
@entity178 voters begin casting @entity178 ballots on february 14			0
@entity1 and his cast are up for three @entity178 , including best original screenplay for @entity1 , best actress for @entity183 and best supporting actress for @entity185			0
@entity0 's @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
