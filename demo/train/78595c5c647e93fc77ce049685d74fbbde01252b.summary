how to survive being stranded at sea according to @entity112 of the @entity11 @entity113 , @entity8 said that four weeks into their drift , he lost the young man because he refused to eat raw birds			1
there are no details on what @entity8 did with the young man 's body			1
@entity8 told the @entity74 his companion 's death had him contemplating suicide			1

massive tuna drags fisherman into ocean government officials have been in contact with @entity20 's ambassador to the @entity11 , who is based in the @entity140 , concerning @entity8 in hopes he can contact @entity143 authorities			1
the @entity20 @entity113 issued a statement saying it has sent personnel from its embassy in the @entity140 " to learn directly about the case			2
" if @entity8 's story proves true , the trip across the @entity6 would have taken him across roughly 6,700 miles ( 10,800 kilometers ) of open ocean before ending in the @entity11 , about halfway between @entity151 and @entity152 , in the @entity153			2
such an amazing journey is n't unheard - of in the small @entity6 nation , as three @entity20 fishermen made a similar drift voyage in 2006 that lasted nine months			2
those men lived off fish they caught and rainwater , and they read the @entity161 for comfort			2
conditions in the @entity6 make the timeline of @entity8 's journey plausible , according to @entity166 , a producer for @entity167			2
@entity166 said the currents between @entity20 and the @entity11 would have carried a boat about 27 miles ( 42 kilometers ) a day			2
that would mean the journey would take about 208 days if the boat stayed in the current			0
but @entity166 said a meandering journey in and out of the currents was most likely , making a 13 - month journey believable .			0
