@entity0 -- @entity4 considered " pulling the plug " on @entity7 's comeback concerts 11 days before the pop icon died , the show 's choreographer testified tuesday			1
@entity9 , who worked closely with @entity7 in his final days , earlier testified that in @entity7 's last rehearsals before his death , he was " not at show standards but he was rehearsing , he was processing			1
" @entity9 was called as a witness by @entity4 to counter @entity7 witnesses who testified in the ongoing wrongful death trial that @entity7 was emaciated , paranoid and so ill they feared for his life as rehearsals continued until shortly before his death on june 25 , 2009			1
the trial , in which @entity7 's mother and three children contend @entity4 is liable in his death , is in its third week in a @entity0 courtroom			1
the lawsuit accuses the concert promoter of negligently hiring dr. @entity26 , the physician who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity7 's death			1
the @entity29 contend @entity4 executives ignored warning signs , including @entity7 's weight loss , because they did not want to delay the premiere of the " @entity35 " concerts set for july 2009			1
witness : ' everybody was lying ' after @entity7 died ' pulling the plug ' on comeback " it was ' we 've got to get this together or the plug may be pulled , ' " @entity9 testified under cross examination by a @entity7 lawyer tuesday			1
@entity7 was having trouble learning some of his dances in the final weeks , he said			1
the jury saw an e-mail from show director @entity50 saying @entity7 had " been slow at grabbing hold of the work			2
" he also asked that a teleprompter be placed near the stage to help him remember song lyrics , something @entity7 had never used before during a concert , he said			2
an e-mail written by " @entity35 " band director @entity59 to @entity50 11 days before @entity7 's death was displayed in court			1
" @entity7 is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time , " @entity59 wrote			2
" he can use the ballads to sing live and get his stamina back up , once he 's healthy enough and have more strength i have full confidence he can sing the majority of the show live			0
his voice sounds amazing right now , he needs to build it back up			0
i still need all big dance numbers to be in the system so we can concentrate on choreography			0
" but @entity50 sent @entity7 home without performing at the next rehearsal three days later because he was ill. " i do n't have a dog in this race , so i do n't want to be painted as a guy who 's trying to mask anything , " @entity9 said when @entity7 lawyer @entity79 suggested he was downplaying concerns about @entity7 's health in the days before he died			1
" mr. @entity7 just explained to me that he had trouble sleeping , that he was tired , and that satisfied me , " @entity9 testified			1
witness : @entity7 was paranoid , talking to himself in last days he told @entity7 , " you 're looking thin , " and @entity7 responded , " well , i 'm getting down to my fighting weight , " according to @entity9 , who added , " i did n't have a reason to doubt him			1
" " sometimes in rehearsal @entity7 would appear a little loopy , under the influence of something , but mostly when he would come to the rehearsals from the dermatologist , " @entity9 testified			1
that happened two to four times in the weeks before his death , he said			0
" @entity7 was undergoing personal cosmetic procedures , so he could feel great and do a good job , " @entity9 said			1
medical records showed @entity7 visited his @entity105 dermatologist nearly two dozen times in the two months before his death , receiving injections of the powerful painkiller @entity109			2
" sometimes he was tired and lethargic and had to be , not convinced , but supported throughout rehearsals , " @entity9 said			2
@entity9 , though , said @entity7 's rehearsals the last two nights were " impressive " when he " was able to do chunks of the show			1
" " he was not at show standards , but he was rehearsing , he was processing , " he said			0
" i did n't expect him to be as if he was in front of a crowd			0
the last two days were pretty good			0
" was he ready to perform for an audience ? @entity79 asked			0
" i thought he was on his way to the goals he had set for himself , " @entity9 answered			1
" all i saw was improvement and getting closer to the goals			0
" one of those goals was for @entity7 to be able to sing all of his songs , while dancing , without the aid of pre-recorded tracks , @entity9 testified monday			1
@entity7 had relied on recorded vocal tracks in previous tours , but he did n't want to use them in @entity131 , he said			2
days before death : ' @entity133 keeps talking to me ' @entity7 's kids : enlightened and loyal @entity9 was often inside @entity7 's home rehearsing with him during his final weeks			1
he got an intimate view of what he called " the beauty " of @entity7 's relationship with his three children			2
@entity9 saw " their loyalty to their father " and their father " enlightened them and taught them , " he testified			2
" i was very proud to see @entity7 as such a loving father			2
" his description of the close relationship @entity152 , 15 , and @entity153 , 16 , had with their father four years ago could foreshadow the significance of the children 's testimony later in the trial			0
@entity152 , who was 11 at the time , was " a very retentive young lady who was very , very smart , very astute , " @entity9 testified			0
" she had full knowledge of the day - to - day operations , from the time of lunch and what it was going to be , she was hands on -- far beyond her age , " he said			0
" she had a lot of responsibility , which i think she welcomed			0
autopsy reveals @entity7 's secrets @entity9 said she was " the female of the house " and " a daddy 's girl			1
" " she really loved her father , " he said			0
" at that time , she was coming to find out his global successes and presence , so she would wear her @entity7 t - shirt , headband and bag , " he said			0
it was @entity152 who would bless the food when they were having lunch with their father at home , he said			0
" she was always the most vocal of the three children and was very concerned about many of the details of the house , was the temperature correct , what do you want to eat , " @entity9 testified			0
" she just handled a lot for her young age			0
" @entity7 's relationship with son @entity153 , then 12 , was " awesome , " @entity9 said			1
" it was great to see how they interacted , " he said			0
" prince wants to be a director , so @entity7 would share conversations with him about that process and point out things during our rehearsals			0
" @entity210 , who was 7 his father died , liked to watch his father rehearsing his dances with @entity9 in the basement studio of their home , @entity9 said			2
" he was quiet , but always right there with his dad , " he said .			0
