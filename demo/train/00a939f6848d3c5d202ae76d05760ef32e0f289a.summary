@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 are the kind of customers the government needs to make @entity8 work			1
the chefs own and operate a bright orange hipster magnet called the @entity11			0
the farm - to - table vehicle stands out in @entity0 , @entity1 , even among the new gastropubs that dot the city 's charming @entity14			1
today @entity3 and @entity4 are zooming around their rented kitchen on the edge of town , preparing deep - fried @entity21 sprouts , @entity22 with seaweed and pumpkin sweet rolls			0
they wo n't have time after their 12 - hour work day to explore the new health insurance marketplaces that opened this morning , but they look forward to seeing what @entity8 can offer them			1
and that 's good news for health care insurance companies			1
young and fit people like @entity3 , 31 , and @entity4 , 28 , have to buy into the system to support the law 's mandate that all people must have health insurance next year			1
under @entity8 , companies can no longer deny policies to people with pre-existing conditions , and some 48 million @entity46 are uninsured , according to the latest @entity48 figures			1
what insurance companies will save on medical costs for the healthier population will help pay for the older , sicker people who are entering into the insurance market for the first time			1
but because they 're young -- and do n't foresee getting sick any time soon -- some @entity57 may decide to skip insurance and risk paying a fine			1

" if it 's not generic , i ca n't afford it			0
" she says her family warned her about this when she left her teaching job in @entity70 to follow her passion for cooking			0
" one of the first things my parents said was that i was really going to miss that good health insurance , and they were right			1
i 'm healthy , but i really do , " @entity77 said			0
" ultimately , though , it 's worth it			0
... this does n't feel like work to me			0
i love what i do			0
new insurance will make this even better			2
" the owners of @entity11 met in 2011 when they enrolled in the culinary arts program at @entity87 in @entity70			0
the two chose to move to @entity1 after working under well - known chefs in @entity90			2
the foodie fast lane , they decided , was n't for them			0
when they scanned the country for opportunities , the food trucks in their @entity94 neighborhood inspired them			0
why not bring a slice of the @entity94 to @entity0 , where @entity4 got his first taste of cooking in the kitchen of his @entity103 - born grandmother ? they were true foodie pioneers			0
@entity3 says the people of @entity0 welcomed their @entity107 take on old @entity109 favorites , but when it comes to health insurance they may have been better off somewhere else			1
@entity1 ranks near the bottom in the nation when it comes to access to care and health outcomes , according to the latest edition of @entity118			1
while @entity8 is federal legislation , the @entity119 ruled that states could decide how they would handle the implementation			2
leaders in @entity1 have been downright antagonistic to the legislation			2
" just because the @entity119 says something is constitutional does n't make it constitutional , " one @entity1 state senator , who introduced an @entity126 bill this year , told the @entity127			1
the senator 's bill failed , as did others -- one of which would actually have made it a crime for a state or federal official to implement any provision of @entity8 -- but the state did successfully refuse to expand @entity141			1
it has not set up its own health care marketplace			1
@entity8 exchanges 101 : what you need to know " we do n't talk politics around here because there goes half our client base , either way , " @entity4 said while mixing the base for the @entity22			2
" but politics aside ... we need something better than what we have			0
" for the more than 726,000 people in @entity1 without insurance there are parts of the federal legislation that will help them			1
many will be able to buy policies through the federal health insurance marketplaces			2
and many , such as the chefs of @entity11 , will be eligible for tax breaks and subsidies to help them pay for any policies bought through these marketplaces			2
the policies themselves will also be much more comprehensive			0
all health insurance plans will now have to cover preventative health care and at least nine other kinds of care , including hospitalization , outpatient care , emergency services , mental health and substance abuse care , maternity and newborn care , prescription drugs , lab tests , rehab , and pediatric care			1
premiums will vary depending on the depth of coverage			0

health care coverage could come in handy right now for @entity4			1
he struggled with a double ear infection for weeks			0
a doctor at the local urgent care center told him ear drops would cost him $ 130 ; he paid to avoid permanent damage to his ears			2
now he has a sinus infection			0
unfortunately , even if he were to buy insurance through the exchanges today , the policies wo n't kick in until january			2
not having insurance , they say , is not an option -- even if the fine would be a lot cheaper than the least expensive policy option			2
" i think of this as an investment in our future health care , " @entity3 said			1
" most of the younger people we hear object to @entity8 are looking at the present and how it affects them now			1
