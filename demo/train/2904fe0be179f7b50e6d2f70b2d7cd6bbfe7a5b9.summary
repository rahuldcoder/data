@entity0 -- the health of @entity4 -- a highly decorated if controversial @entity6 military figure whose time as prime minister was ground to a halt by an incapacitating stroke -- has taken a turn for the worse , a hospital spokeswoman said wednesday			1
the 85 - year - old 's life is in danger as he battles serious kidney problems , @entity6 media -- including state radio -- reported , citing " sources			1
" @entity4 's medical condition has worsened " in the last few days , " according to @entity21 spokeswoman @entity19			1
@entity4 has been in a coma since january 2006 , when he suffered a major stroke that led doctors to put him under anesthesia and on a respirator			1
his family planned to meet at the @entity6 hospital saturday to mark the eighth anniversary of his hospitalization , reported @entity6 's @entity33 , a @entity1 affiliate			1
born in 1928 in @entity34 -- a community that would later become part of @entity6 -- @entity4 began working with the @entity37 , a militant group advocating for @entity6 's independence , after graduating from high school in 1945			1
after a year of studies at @entity43 , he began his rise through the @entity6 military ranks in 1953 , including helping establish an elite commando unit and various promotions up to the army 's major general			0
he held this rank during 1967 's @entity51 , which ended with @entity6 notably , if controversially , expanding its territory			0
@entity4 went on to play major roles in subsequent @entity6 military conflicts as well , including as head of the @entity57 's @entity56 during the 1973 @entity58			1
he then began segueing into government , including stints as prime minister @entity62 's military adviser , agriculture minister and defense minister from august 1981 to february 1983			2
his actions in this last post led many in the @entity69 world to label him the " @entity70			0
" @entity4 orchestrated @entity6 's invasion of @entity72 , an effort aimed at @entity75 fighters that also left hundreds of @entity72 civilians dead			1
an official @entity6 inquiry found @entity4 indirectly responsible for the september 1982 killings of as many as 2,000 @entity79 at the @entity81 refugee camps outside of @entity82 , @entity72			2
the report -- which led to @entity4 's prompt resignation -- determined the then - defense minister did nothing to stop @entity88 militiamen allied with @entity6 from entering the camps , despite fears they might seek to avenge the killing of their leader the previous day			1
@entity4 did not stay out of the spotlight for long , with his adviser @entity95 saying " he felt betrayed by his government			2
" he sued @entity98 for a magazine article implying that he had foreknowledge and a greater role in this massacre , with a jury later finding the @entity105 - based publisher guilty of defamation but not of malice			0
@entity4 went on to hold a several other @entity109 posts from 1984 to 2001 , when he won a special election to become prime minister			2
by then , as head of the @entity115 party , @entity4 was considered a hawk			0
and early on , he took the offensive by sending tanks and troops into @entity79 territory and ordering the assassination of militant leaders			0
but @entity4 also took steps toward peace , such as agreeing with @entity75 leader @entity126 on a timeline to halt @entity6 - @entity79 violence and resume peace talks -- only to have this effort undermined by his own party , which backed a resolution to never allow the creation of a @entity79 state			0
@entity4 later participated in talks with regional and world powers to discuss a " road map " for @entity140 peace			0
immediately after he fell ill in early 2006 , his power was transferred to vice premier @entity143			0
surgeons removed 20 inches of his intestine the following month and , that april , @entity6 's @entity109 formally ended his run as prime minister after declaring him permanently incapacitated			0
the former prime minister 's health has fluctuated during the time he has been in the coma			1
in january 2013 , doctors said testing on @entity4 indicated some brain activity when he was shown photos of his home and heard his son 's voice			2
@entity4 brain results not proof he 'll wake up			0
