-- this week , we hosted a renowned expert in hiv / aids care currently practicing at a hospital known for serving the poor and vulnerable in @entity6			1
it was her impression that there has been a dramatic decline in the number of hospitalized patients living with @entity3			1
presently , in fact , the hospital is considering closing the service that cares exclusively for these individuals because of the small number of admissions			1
those of us involved in the care of individuals with @entity3 in @entity20 were amazed			1
at @entity21 and the @entity22 , which is our outpatient hiv / aids clinic , we remain busy seeing newly diagnosed individuals with @entity25 , particularly presenting with late - stage disease and afflicted by the classic infections and cancers so common 30 years ago , when @entity3 was first described			1
this month , secretary of state @entity29 gave a moving address at the @entity31 calling for an @entity25 - free generation , and the theme of @entity34 on december 1 was " getting to zero			1
" recently released data have shown a dramatic 96 % reduction in transmission of the hiv virus between individuals when the infected partner is on antiretroviral therapy , leading to the concept of " treatment as prevention			1
" treatment regimens are simpler : active medication regimens once exceeded 20 pills daily , yet now a single pill once a day can control the virus			1
nearly three dozen medications have been developed and are effective at decreasing mortality and improving quality of life			1
mathematical estimates suggest that an individual diagnosed with @entity3 infection today , while still healthy , can live as long as an uninfected individual			1
however , the fight is far from over			1
although enthusiasm remains high , an effective vaccine is still out of reach			1
in the absence of a cure , lifelong treatment is required			2
but perhaps an even more disturbing question remains : why do our patients in @entity20 resemble those who we saw on the medical wards in the early 1990s or see now in resource - limited settings , moreso than outpatients treated in @entity6 today ? despite tremendous progress , hiv / aids infections in the @entity73 continue to rise			2
nearly 50 % of all @entity25 cases annually are reported from @entity76			1
among adults aged 20 - 24 ( the fastest - growing age group to become infected ) , @entity77 has 81.3 individuals with hiv infection per 100,000 population , compared with 58.6 per 100,000 in @entity6			1
several important studies have documented the key risk factors associated with transmission of @entity3 , and all of them highlight social disparities			1
in the @entity90 , these disparities appear to be the most severe			2
according to the @entity93 's health rankings , the region ranks lowest in the nation in " overall health			2
" structural and socioeconomic factors play a significant role			2
poverty , education and literacy , access to health care , unemployment , homelessness and food insecurity all contribute to poorer health outcomes			2
a recent study that examined outcomes in patients identified with early hiv infection found that a risk factor for development of @entity25 was residence in the @entity90			1
furthermore , resources are scarcer for patients in the @entity90			2
for example , federal support is based on the number of cumulative cases of patients with @entity3 or @entity25 rather than the development of new cases , penalizing states with later epidemics ( like the @entity90 ) and those whose policies did not support early reporting of cases of @entity3			1
medicaid income eligibility is based on individual state policy			2
in the @entity90 , the income cutoff for eligibility is lower on average than elsewhere and is a fraction of the federal poverty level , leaving many without the ability to access this medical help			2
state health departments are often poorly funded or organized and do not have the same strong infrastructure and reporting capabilities that have been highly successful in @entity141 , @entity6 and @entity142			2
@entity25 drug assistance programs in the @entity90 are underfunded , limiting access to life - saving medications for patients			1
in @entity77 , which has the second - longest wait list in the country , patients may be less able to access medications for life - threatening @entity25 complications than those in the developing world			1
americans often turn a blind eye to the problem of @entity25 in the @entity157			1
the message has been that the epidemic is nearly over			2
even middle - class residents in @entity20 are unaware of the scope of the problem in their own city			0
there is denial that such striking health disparities can exist in one of the richest nations in the world			0
this disenfranchised population does not have the same political voice that the organized gay community had in the early days of the epidemic , when @entity176 drug approval policies were adjusted to help more patients get access to medications faster			0
our patients feel stigmatized and are afraid to be seen entering the building where our clinic is located			0
yet globally , the devastation from the disease receives attention not bestowed on the epidemic located a few blocks away			0
we are 30 years into this epidemic			0
how will we reflect upon the next 30 years ? will we say that we halted this disease from eliminating an entire generation in @entity192 ? will we remind ourselves of how the subcontinent of @entity194 was brought to the brink of disaster , only to be diverted by a worldwide effort to prevent and treat infections ? or will the already - devastated inner - city neighborhoods and poor rural communities across the @entity157 sink into greater despair ? will we bear the guilt for so many lost lives that could have been saved ? in our opinion , both missions must be addressed , not one at the expense of the other			0
if an aids - free generation is to be realized , then we must not forget the disease within our own borders			0
can we watch our neighbors suffer when the medical knowledge exists to change their future ? facing this challenge is no small feat. there are signs of hope			0
for example , the @entity219 has initiated the @entity221 for 12 municipalities , including @entity20 and @entity223 , for efforts to reduce @entity3 infections , link patients to care and reduce disparities			0
yet this is only a beginning			0
basic issues such as poverty , education , housing and safety need to be addressed			0
state and federal lawmakers must understand that basic health care is a requirement and will require money			0
one of our patients is a 33 - year - old mother infected with @entity3			1
she has taken her medications faithfully since her diagnosis and has been back at work for several years			0
she wants to raise her children to be happy , healthy and productive members of society			0
her work insurance policy recently changed			0
now her insurance will cover only one prescription per month ( maximum $ 200 )			0
her regimen requires three medications , which exceed $ 1,500 a month			0
state support and prescription assistance programs are restricted to those without insurance			0
she makes $ 1,800 a month , which she must use to pay rent and utilities , and feed and clothe her children			0
she can no longer afford the medications that keep her alive and give her children a mother			0
this is a tragedy that we should not be willing to tolerate in a society that values social justice and human rights			0
take action now by encouraging your congressional representatives and political leaders to keep their promise on @entity25 , increasing awareness in your own community , volunteering and / or giving to charities that support such efforts and sharing words of solidarity and compassion with those people most affected by this disease			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity283 and @entity284 .			0

nearly 50 % of all @entity25 cases annually are reported from @entity76 states
right now , a single pill once a day can control the virus
96 % reduction in transmission when infected partner is on antiretroviral therapy
