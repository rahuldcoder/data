@entity0 -- the family of late @entity4 music icon @entity3 on wednesday voiced opposition to a controversial process of natural gas drilling known as fracking , @entity9 , who appeared at a press conference in @entity0 with his mother , @entity11 , said fracking is " dirty , it 's just inherently dirty			1
" " the bottom line is there is a campaign of misinformation to try to tell people that hydraulic fracturing is a clean alternative to coal or other fossil fuels , " he said			0
@entity0 gov. @entity22 is expected to take up the decision on whether to allow fracking , or horizontal hydraulic fracturing , which involves pumping millions of gallons of water and chemicals into shale formations deep beneath the @entity31 's surface			1
this process causes the fracturing of the rock and the release of natural gas , but has raised concerns over the potential for chemicals to seep into the drinking water supply			1
drought - stricken fracking firms turn to farms ' water wells for help @entity3 unveiled a campaign called " @entity45 " to oppose the expansion of the process while it is under review by @entity0 's @entity48			1
the regulatory decision would not require a vote in the state legislature			2
@entity3 's family acquired a farm in @entity54 in the 1970s , and he said he grew concerned about fracking after being invited to a community meeting held by the natural gas industry that was seeking to expand drilling			1
those concerns led @entity3 to form " @entity45 , " with his mother 's help , and to sign up former @entity4 sir @entity61 and @entity62 , as well as actors @entity63 and @entity65 , among more than 100 other artists			2
" we just asked friends to call friends and it accelerated from there , " @entity3 said			0
" when people who do n't know much about it , or are on the fence , when they realize that it 's water and air , which is something we all relate to and depend on , most reasonable people want to get on board			2
" a de facto moratorium on horizontal hydraulic fracturing has been in place since 2010 while the state conducts an environmental review of the process , which is widespread in neighboring @entity87 , which shares the @entity89 formation with @entity0			1
@entity91 professor @entity90 , who appeared at the @entity92 conference , said industry data show one out of 20 wells leak			0
" no matter what the industry tells you , their own data ... proves conclusively to any reasonable scientist or engineer that it is impossible to design any well so it will never leak , " @entity90 said			0
the best and the brightest in that industry have been trying to solve that problem for 100 years			0
" but @entity107 , president of @entity108 , which operates 237 wells in @entity0 using the older vertical hydraulic method , said he did not believe the figures on well leakage were accurate			2
" i have not seen data that supports that			0
" the @entity115 of @entity0 , which advocates for the drilling industry , said fracking had helped reduce @entity119 carbon dioxide emissions to their lowest levels since the early 1990s			1
" artists who have turned into activists on this issue are being led by those who are more comfortable twisting the facts and taking part in street theater , stunts and gimmicks , " said @entity115 president @entity121			2
" they are ignoring the prosperity and environmental protection that modern natural gas development is bringing to many other states			1
" the renewed debate over fracking came after press reports that @entity22 was nearing a decision on allowing limited fracking in five counties in southeastern @entity0 , near the @entity87 border			1
but a spokesman for @entity22 said no decision had been reached , and was not expected to come for weeks			1
any move would follow the release of a final report by the @entity148 of @entity149			2
" our review of high - volume hydraulic fracturing is continuing and no decisions have been made , " the agency said , noting it was preparing a response to the 80,000 comments received from the public			0
" once we review the comments , we will make any necessary changes to the documents			0
we will most likely release the final documents by the end of the year			0
" according to analysts , the @entity119 @entity163 exempted industry from federal oversight , meaning that all regulatory authority falls to state authorities , rather than the @entity169			0
it is up to @entity22 to decide whether to proceed with fracking			1
it will fall upon the @entity48 to issue permits for horizontal hydraulic fracturing			0
debate over fracking , quakes gets louder			0
