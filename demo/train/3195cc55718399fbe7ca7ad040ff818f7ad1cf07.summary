-- a @entity2 jury deliberated just 37 minutes before convicting an anti-abortion activist of first - degree murder in the fatal shooting of an abortion provider			1
the jury found @entity7 , 51 , guilty of gunning down dr. @entity8 , who operated a clinic in @entity10 where late - term abortions were performed			1
@entity7 , 51 , faces life in prison when he is sentenced on march 9			2
@entity8 's family said the jury reached a " just " verdict			1
" at this time we hope that @entity8 can be remembered for his legacy of service to women , the help he provided for those who needed it and the love and happiness he provided us as a husband , father and grandfather , " the family said in a written statement			1
a day earlier , @entity7 told jurors he had shot @entity8 in the foyer of @entity32 as sunday services began			1
testifying as his only defense witness , he said he believed he had to kill @entity8 to save lives			2
he said he had no regrets			0
" there was nothing being done , and the legal process had been exhausted , and these babies were dying every day , " @entity7 said			2
" i felt that if someone did not do something , he was going to continue			0
" " his testimony was delivered very matter - of - factly , but its contents were chillingly horrific , " prosecutor @entity44 said in her closing argument			0
" he carried out a planned assassination , and there can be no other verdict in this case ... other than guilty			0
" quick verdict surprised prosecutor prosecutors initially fought to keep abortion out of the trial , claiming that @entity8 's death was a straightforward case of premeditated murder			1
eventually , the abortion issue took center stage as prosecutors portrayed @entity8 as a target of @entity7 's anti-abortion agenda , and defense lawyers attempted to mitigate his culpability under the theory that he believed @entity8 's death was justified to save the lives of others			1
defense attorney @entity70 told jurors in his closing argument that @entity7 " thought that the babies kept on dying " and he had to stop @entity8 from " killing more babies			1
" another defense attorney , @entity75 , said @entity7 was " disappointed , " with the verdict			1
but he added , " he 's known that this day was going to come , i think			0
" @entity75 said his client " feels remorse toward the family , but not for what he did			0
" the trial drew activists from both sides of the abortion debate to the courtroom , and a van plastered with slogans and photographs of fetuses was parked in a prominent spot in front of the courthouse			0
among the attendees were the rev. @entity94 , whose history in the anti-abortion movement includes 1985 conspiracy convictions in connection with a string of clinic bombings , and @entity101 , executive vice president of the @entity102			0
congregants from @entity32 testified that they had seen @entity7 at church several times before the day he killed @entity8 by shooting him at point - blank range in the head			1
jurors heard emotional testimony from church - goers who rushed to @entity8 's side and attempted to administer mouth - to - mouth resuscitation as he lay in a pool of blood			1
others , meanwhile , followed @entity7 into the church parking lot , where he threatened to shoot them			2
@entity7 also was convicted of aggravated assault in connection with threats he made to two ushers , @entity121 and @entity122			2
as @entity7 pulled away in his car , @entity122 testified , something moved him to throw the coffee cup he was holding at the vehicle			2
" frustration , i guess , lack of accomplishment , nothing else to do			0
" prosecutors also called employees of the pawn shop where @entity7 purchased the .22 - caliber @entity134 pistol believed to have been used to shoot @entity8			1
the gun was never found , but surveillance video and receipts showed that he purchased the gun on may 18 and received it on may 23 , the week before he shot @entity8			0
@entity7 's defense team did not dispute much of the factual evidence			2
@entity7 testified that he chose to target @entity8 at church because it presented the best " window of opportunity " to attack @entity8 , who traveled in an armored vehicle and whose clinic was a " fortress			1
" he admitted bringing the pistol with him to @entity147 on may 24 with the intention of shooting @entity8 , but the physician did not attend services that day			0
so , @entity7 testified , he returned the following week			1
" do you feel as though you 've successfully completed your mission ? " @entity154 district attorney @entity153 asked @entity7 on thursday			0
" he 's been stopped , " @entity7 answered			2
his testimony was intended just as much for the jury as it was to convince judge @entity158 that evidence existed to support a possible conviction of voluntary manslaughter			0
a conviction on the lesser offense , which is defined as " an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force , " would have set @entity7 free from prison after five years			0
earlier in the trial , @entity158 said he would rule after hearing evidence in the case , acknowledging that he felt the defense faced " an uphill battle			0
" ultimately , he rejected the theory , saying testimony did not support the defense claim that @entity7 's beliefs justified using deadly force against @entity8			1
" there is no imminence of danger on a sunday morning in the back of a church , let alone any unlawful conduct , given that what @entity8 did at his clinic monday through friday is lawful in @entity2 , " the judge said			1
in @entity186 's @entity185 and @entity0 's @entity187 contributed to this story .			0
