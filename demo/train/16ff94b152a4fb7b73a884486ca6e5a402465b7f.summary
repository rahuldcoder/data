-- the @entity1 is sailing back into the @entity2 , but initial euphoria is being tempered by the dangerous realities of the work left to be done			2
like a new college student heading off to school , it is increasingly apparent that gaining admission was the easy part : to graduate requires a full commitment , and there are a number of hurdles along the way			0
already , tough decisions are being made with respect to the @entity1 ' global defense strategy , which now recognizes that costly wars with little economic return are no longer viable			2
yet while the @entity1 increasingly seeks to obtain a greater share of the @entity2 's economic growth , it similarly sees its military presence in the region as critical for maintaining security			1
@entity27 reaffirmed this strategy at the @entity29 on thursday , stating that " budget reductions will not come at the expense of this critical region			0
" importantly , the @entity1 ' strong military and diplomatic re-engagement with @entity2 countries , particularly those in @entity37 , has not fallen on deaf ears in @entity39			1
sharing his concerns with respect to increasing international influence on domestic affairs , @entity40 warned in a january 1 statement , " hostile international powers are strengthening their efforts to westernize and divide us			0
" adding to the tension of the @entity1 ' newfound strategy are the political transitions that will , or are likely to occur , in 2012			2
the @entity1 presidential election , presidential leadership change in @entity39 and @entity54 , and now the volatile political transition in @entity56 will encourage tough rhetoric from politicians with respect to international relations in order to appease constituencies			1
strong words present a serious challenge to stability in the @entity2 , particularly as the @entity1 ramps up its military presence			0
the starting point in the run - up to the @entity1 ' @entity70 convocation was secretary of state @entity72 's october 11 article , " @entity76 's @entity75 , " published in @entity74			1
she identified five areas for re-engaging the region , including bilateral security , deepening working relationships , multilateralism , trade and finally , human rights and democracy			0
the areas @entity87 outlined for re-engagement are also important to @entity2 states , and particularly the relatively small @entity37 nations			2
yet while trade relations with the @entity1 are vital for sustaining @entity37 's significant economic growth , the greatest gains from increased cooperation with @entity76 will come in the form of military protection			1
across the region , governments are increasingly concerned with @entity39 's military might , as much as they are happy with @entity39 's economic investments			1
teaming with the @entity1 is a sensible insurance policy			0
but the @entity1 ' increased military presence in the region , which will include marines in @entity104 , naval ships in @entity106 and increased military cooperation with the @entity108 and @entity109 , while having the potential to lend stability , also raises the stakes as to what could go wrong			0
now , more than ever , with impending political change on both sides of the @entity2 , politicians are keen to assert themselves as strong on defense and as advocates of their respective national interests			0
one instance in which heightened regional tensions are especially evident is with the increasingly frequent spats over energy reserves in the @entity125 , an area recognized by the @entity108 as the " @entity125 " and by @entity109 as the " @entity125			0
" the lack of consensus with respect to a name for the same body of water evidences how possessive governments are of this energy - rich area			0
regarding their maritime claims , @entity108 secretary for foreign affairs @entity134 stated in december that the @entity1 is increasingly willing to assist the @entity108 ' efforts to develop a " minimum credible defense posture " with respect to the disputed territories			0
however , recent and planned @entity1 military actions in the @entity2 could be construed by @entity39 as exceeding a " minimum , " and incidents such as one in october 2011 , in which a @entity108 naval vessel bumped into a @entity39 fishing boat alleged to be encroaching on the former 's territorial waters , now have a greater potential to escalate			1
@entity76 needs to recognize and respect the accomplishments @entity39 has achieved in its own backyard , in spite of the country 's shortfalls in winning over the trust of its neighbors			1
after directing its attention largely elsewhere for most of the last decade , @entity76 has pragmatically recognized that its own long - term security , whether at home or abroad , is tied closely to the @entity2 's economic progress			1
@entity70 countries have shown they are willing to offer the @entity1 opportunities for investment in return for security assistance			1
but without effective dialogue with @entity39 in particular , the risk of military escalation is much more real			2
the @entity1 just exited one costly war and is ramping down another ; it therefore needs to ensure it does n't lose sight of its economic priorities in the @entity2 , and the best way to do this is through more effective dialogue with @entity39 with regard to its military intentions			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0

@entity76 is rightly *focusing* on @entity37 but it must recognize the risks , says @entity184
he says @entity70 nations fear @entity39 's power but appreciate its investments
@entity1 is seen by these countries as a security *counterweight* to @entity39 , he says
@entity181 : @entity1 must guard against risk of an incident being escalated into war
