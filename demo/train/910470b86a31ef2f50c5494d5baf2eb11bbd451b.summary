-- when i first heard about the shooting rampage in a @entity4 theater , i was shocked and horrified			2
it was like reliving the @entity6 shooting all over again			1
news : remembering the @entity4 shooting victims on april 16 , 2007 , @entity6 experienced the largest mass shooting on a college campus , with 32 students killed and 17 wounded			1
our typical serene spring morning was bombarded with continuous screeching of rescue and police sirens alerting everyone that a terrible situation was at hand			0
as news spread , our community responded swiftly , but with a sense of bewilderment , grief and anger			1
there was no doubt that this was a life changing experience for the survivors as well as families of the victims			1
timeline : worst mass shootings in @entity35 the campus disaster response network immediately sprung into action to assist families directly affected by the shooting			1
the day after the incident , a network of professionals met to begin the task of planning an ongoing mental health response to the tragedy			2
this group included university personnel , counselors , clinical psychologists , community agencies and the local mental health association			2
on the day after the attack , a candlelight vigil was held for the entire university			2
it was quite moving to observe the thousands of candles burning , signifying the great loss			0
that night , 6 - foot walls of plywood and paper provided the opportunity to record @entity63 verses , sentiments and vows to remember those who died			0
a website , @entity68 , encouraged people to bring mementos to the drill field as an expression of love and support			2
@entity75 took place in @entity77 and @entity78			0
this event was well attended by about 35,000 students , faculty and staff			0
the service was a major step in communal healing			0
the attendance of president @entity87 , first lady @entity88 and gov. @entity89 was an important source of support			2
the resolve to engender hope was eloquently voiced by the final words of professor and poet @entity96 , " ... we are the @entity98 , we will prevail , we will prevail , we will prevail ...			0
we are @entity6 " by all indications , it appears that @entity101 , @entity4 , engaged in many similar steps to meet the immediate demands of the traumatized victims			1
the swat team , police and rescue personnel reacted quickly			0
it appears that the clergy , mental health professionals and the @entity111 were all responsive in timely and meaningful ways			0
as the days pass , people in the community have been offering condolences to the families with flowers , candles and mementos			1
news : @entity4 shooting : stories of survival the memorial service demonstrates the community 's show of genuine care			1
president @entity128 meeting with the families as a group and as individuals was a powerful acknowledgment of their pain and hopefully served as a tremendous sign that the nation stands behind them			1
perhaps the most unfortunate consequences of both the @entity6 and @entity101 tragedies is that the families of the deceased , the injured and others most exposed to the shooting ( including first responders ) often do not seek help			1
the stigma associated with mental health interventions prevents individuals from obtaining much needed assistance			0
it is too frequently the case that individuals wait for years to take advantage of the effective mental health treatments targeting traumatic experiences			0
months and years of pain , anxiety , confusion as well as loss of relationships and lack of effectiveness in the classroom or workplace is tolerated until " breaking points " are reached			0
those affected by the shooting should not be afraid to ask for help ; they should not wait and suffer silently and alone			1
news : how to help the victims it is my hope that the resilience and communal strength displayed by the @entity177 in the days , months and years after the @entity6 shooting will serve as a model for everyone affected in that @entity101 movie theater			1
the adage " out of darkness comes light " is a reminder for those who endure tragedy that there is always hope			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity193 : hearing about the @entity101 shooting was like reliving the @entity6 shooting
@entity191 : @entity6 community responded quickly , with support for the victims ' families
he says families of the deceased , the injured and others should not be afraid to seek help
@entity191 : @entity101 community , the entire nation is standing behind you in this time of tragedy
