-- last wednesday , in a move that i still do n't fully understand , i became a shareholder in the @entity5 football club @entity4			1
in terms of my relationship with football , i should probably lay my cards on the table			0
i am a @entity11 fan			1
anyone of a certain age with a passing interest in the game will understand that i 'm familiar with disappointment			2
having watched @entity11 fall from the heights of back - to - back @entity19 wins to the depths of @entity24 football 's third tier i know , all too well , the emotions involved in witnessing a distressing decline			1
this doubtless explains why some sense of faded glamour or a struggle against adversity tends to attract me to a club			2
to illustrate this point , my favorite @entity34 team is @entity36 , currently lying 14th in @entity37 , as they say , is n't everything			0
i realise this is perverse , but i 've never been able to understand the appeal of supporting a football giant , going into a season in the confident expectation of wins and trophies			0
@entity46 so a couple of weeks ago , when i first heard of the plight of @entity49 , something clicked			1
i found myself googling the club , reading about the city of @entity49 , admiring the jagged hills of @entity53			1
my attention was piqued by @entity55 , the @entity56 journalist whose animated appreciation of @entity5 football has brought @entity59 to life for many outside @entity5			1
@entity55 ignited the international campaign to save the club , while also warning that investors were highly unlikely to see any return			1
to paraphrase @entity46 , he had me at ' unlikely '			0
here was a potentially lost cause that i was powerless to resist			0
i stepped up my research and prepared to delve into the insanity of football club ownership			2
by the time i was ready to take the plunge , @entity4 's global coalition of the willing had swelled considerably and the club was almost half way to safety			1
the share offer 's website looked reassuringly professional , and was helpfully available in @entity24			2
@entity78 i had initially thought of just buying one share , but then i discovered that owning four shares would entitle me to attend the annual general meeting			1
i imagined myself turning up at the airport , being feted as an arriving hero and bought drinks in @entity49 's tapas bars just for being me			1
i rejected any thoughts that this scenario was somewhat far - fetched			2
i inputted my passport number , transferred the cash , sat back and enjoyed the warm glow of owning something of no apparent value whatsoever			0
the weird thing is that it really was a glow			0
i had another look at the impressive @entity78 and smiled to myself			0
i wondered how much flights would cost , and how i would persuade my wife that a weekend in @entity53 was a good idea			0
i started following @entity49 types on @entity99			1
i re-tweeted a link to the club 's soon - to - be - opened online shop			1
@entity103 as the club 's deadline day of november 17 approached , i kept an eye on the increasingly positive news coming from northern @entity5 ; this people 's club , now partly my club , looked close to completing its path to safety			1
then came the news of @entity115 billionaire @entity114 's intervention			2
as a push over the line goes it could hardly be more emphatic , and suddenly the need to gather more shareholders became irrelevant			0
@entity49 was in the clear ; 13,000 shareholders and the world 's richest man had made it happen			1
i was n't quite sure how i felt about this new development			0
the idea that a multi-billionaire was now bankrolling the club was anathema to me ; i still feel that the age of the oligarch has done little but damage to football , at least in @entity24			0
but it also opened up a world of possibilities			0
even @entity11 have super-rich owners now , and at the @entity140 the @entity139 family have appeared at pains to show the club 's fans that they intend to do things " the right way "			1
maybe @entity114 would be the same			0
so far my only proof of ownership is my receipt from @entity149 , which almost a week on makes me slightly uneasy but i hope is just a sign of how unbelievably successful this escapade has been for the club			0
i have a genuine feeling of being part of something , and a sense that this is the start of an exciting story			0
i also fully intend to make it to a game at the earliest available opportunity			0
i suppose i should probably think about how i explain to my wife that i 've spent a chunk of our weekly shopping money on a @entity5 third division football team			1
she 's a @entity167 fan ; surely she 'll understand ? for now though i 'm waiting patiently for my share certificate to arrive in the post			2
whatever happens at the very least i have to buy a @entity4 mug .			2

why would a @entity11 fan invest *$* *52* in third - tier @entity5 club @entity4 ?
@entity176 interest in @entity49 piqued by @entity56 journalist @entity55
@entity176 bought four shares allowing him to attend @entity49 's annual general meeting
the third division club had had until november 17 to avoid *extinction*
