-- @entity1 is facing fines and penalties after @entity5 's highest court found the government has failed to do enough to protect its hamsters			1
in a case that stretches back three years , the @entity8 said thursday that the @entity1 government has n't adequately conserved the remaining few hundred @entity11 of @entity12 still living in a small enclave in eastern @entity1			2
" the court finds that the measures implemented by @entity1 in 2008 were not adequate to enable effective avoidance of deterioration or destruction of the breeding sites and resting places of the @entity22 , " the @entity8 said in a statement			1
the little 10 - inch rodents are considered pests by farmers there , and were trapped , poisoned almost out of existence by the early 1990s when they got official protection			1
but as the last surviving example of hamster left in western @entity5 , the court says they deserve better protection in line with the suit by @entity36 regulators			1
" the commission complains that in 2008 , @entity1 failed to take adequate measures to ensure strict protection of the @entity22 in @entity12 ( @entity1 ) , the only region where it is present , " the court said			1
the hamster is at risk of extinction as a result of harmful agricultural practices and urbanization , which disturb its breeding and resting places , according to the court			2
changing farming practices combined with encroaching building and urbanization in recent decades have led to the destruction of nearly all their burrows along the rivers there , leading to a population collapse			0
the commission said the switch to summer - ripening maize in many farms had further harmed the population because when the white - pawed , black - bellied hamsters wake up from hibernation in the spring , there 's no seed to eat			0
and while the court praised a move to grow winter crops and alfalfa that the hamsters like to munch on , it found that the government - backed moves were too little and too late			0
there are only about 800 of the animals still alive , but that 's several times more than were alive just a few years ago			0
still , the court determined that there had to be nearly twice the current number of the little creatures to sustain their population			0
the @entity1 @entity84 was not immediately available for comment .			0
