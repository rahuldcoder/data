@entity0 -- perched on the edge of her hospital bed , @entity2 performs a song she wrote and takes a bow			1
it 's a song about perseverance , with a common refrain of " you can do it , if you try it			1
" @entity2 is one of those 10 - year - olds you feel lucky just to meet			1
but it 's not because of her talents as a budding singer - songwriter , even though they are impressive			1
it 's because of her attitude and her drive for life			2
@entity2 was born with cystic fibrosis and has been in and out of hospitals her whole life			1
but it was n't until february when @entity2 and her parents , residents of @entity27 , @entity28 , were forced to start living at @entity30			1
for the past several months , her lungs have deteriorated rapidly -- much faster than her family had expected			2
she has less than five weeks left to live , said her mother , @entity33			2
" we knew at some point , she would need new lungs , " her father , @entity34 , said			0
" we had hoped it would be much further down the road , but the disease has progressed			0
" @entity2 , the oldest of four siblings , is well - aware she 's sick -- but not aware of just how sick			1
" i 'm not going to tell her she 's dying , because she 's 10 , " @entity33 said			1
" i 'm going to tell her we 're going to keep fighting			1
" " i do n't want to scare her			0
" while shooting an @entity46 video of her daughter , @entity33 asks , " when are we getting you back to school ? " " definitely a couple of months before ( i go back ) -- maybe even a year			1
" school is one of the things @entity2 misses most about life outside of her new environment			2
" i used to go to school before i got oxygen , " @entity2 says , pausing to wipe away tears as the " puffs " from the oxygen mask toss her bangs			2
" got to go to school and at least try and act like all the other normal children			0
" life with cystic fibrosis : ' pretend you 're on a boat ' asked how she would describe living with " @entity67 , " @entity2 says to " close your eyes and pretend you 're on a boat			1
" the boat she describes represents her lungs			0
" the water keeps the boat afloat , but sand sinks your boat			0
and all we got is a little sandy , but we 're going to be ok			0
" " she may feel like she 's kind of sinking , " mom said in a later interview			2
" as she said , what you can do ... is kind of brush off the sand , or if you need to get a new boat , kind of start over , which would be a transplant , to get a new set of lungs , so she 'd be clean again			0
" but " brushing off her boat " and getting that transplant has proved difficult			0
@entity2 's been on the wait list for new lungs for 18 months , and the @entity91 were under the impression a transplant was imminent			1
she is , after all , the no. 1 candidate on the priority list for children in her region , which consists of @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity28 , @entity101 and northern @entity102			0
but that 's where it gets tricky -- she tops the list for children 's lungs -- not adult lungs			1
for @entity2 , a modified adult lung would fit as well			1
two weeks ago , @entity33 and @entity34 learned that if @entity2 were 12 , she 'd have a much better chance of receiving adult lungs			1
but since she is 10 , she primarily has access to children 's lungs , which are in shorter supply			2
" that 's insane , " mom said			2
" it should n't be about their age			0
if she 's the sickest person , she should qualify			0
" few lung transplants for children in 2012 , there were just 10 transplants in @entity2 's age group , according to the @entity128			1
there were more than 1,700 adult transplants			2
according to the rules created by the organ network , the only way @entity2 could receive an adult lung is if the other patients in her region who are 12 and older had a chance at it first			1
it 's a rule that @entity33 -- who 's been dealing with getting her daughter a transplant for 18 months and who " did her research " -- learned about just two weeks ago			1
" i was shocked , " @entity33 said			2
dr. @entity145 of @entity146 is a board member at the @entity128 and helped write the current pediatric transplant system			0
" it 's not a perfect system			0
there is no perfect system , " @entity145 said in an interview			0
" it 's the best we can do right now			0
" @entity145 said @entity2 's story " tugs at his heart " but that if he changed the system for @entity2 's advantage , " there 's another patient , very likely an adolescent , who gets a disadvantage			1
" " we 've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible			0
" mom and dad know that the rules are making it almost impossible for their daughter to receive a pair of lungs through the transplant system			1
but there is a shred of hope : there is always the possibility that someone steps forward with a direct donation to @entity2			2
@entity30 declined an interview with @entity1 for this story , but @entity33 said doctors are telling her that @entity2 could " crash " any time now and need intubation , the insertion of a tube into her lungs for breathing assistance			1
the procedure is especially dangerous for cystic fibrosis patients			1
she said doctors are planning to operate in coming days in an effort to divert that crash , which should buy her a few more weeks and more time for a potential direct donor to reach out to the @entity91			0
this procedure is known as @entity198 -- extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -- and is used occasionally as a bridge to lung transplantation			0
for now , @entity2 , who has been outdoors only twice in the past 100 days , is looking forward to a possible transplant			2
as she puts it , " i 'm not going for easy -- i 'm just going for possible			0
" " we will ( get them ) ! i ca n't wait to take my first breath with new lungs			0
i can close my eyes right now and imagine it			0
" " are we gon na quit ? " mom asks			0
" no ! " she shouts at the top of her lungs and slapping the bed with both hands			0
" i 'm never going to quit ! never , never ! " new transplant technology keeps organs ' alive ' outside body running with someone else 's lungs			1

ten - year - old @entity2 has cystic fibrosis and is caught up in a *medical* tangle
she needs a new pair of lungs , but the rules say she 's still a little too young for adult lungs
adult lung transplants are much more common , an organ sharing network says
@entity2 's mom , @entity33 : " i 'm going to tell her we 're going to keep fighting "
