-- in 2003 , former newspaper editor @entity1 made a mistake that cost him his freedom : he published a cartoon			1
the sketch in question , a drawing from 1937 depicting @entity10 president @entity9 's pressure on the @entity10 @entity11 , seemed an innocuous choice for the @entity14 newspaper , @entity15 but @entity14 's @entity16 disagreed			1
according to @entity18 it ruled that that the cartoon 's depiction of @entity9 looked suspiciously like the @entity22 's founder @entity21 and was insulting to his memory			0
the court shut down @entity25 , and @entity1 spent nearly two months in prison			0
a decade later , @entity1 's friend and former colleague , journalist @entity29 , decided to honor the pressures placed on satirists in a book entitled , " sketches of @entity14 : a glimpse from the @entity35			1
" the book , published in january by the @entity37 , was informed by @entity29 's conviction that political cartoons played a unique role in his country 's struggle for democracy			1
" over the past ten years i 've been working as a journalist both in @entity14 and out of @entity14 , and i 've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions , " he explained			1
" cartoons communicate with a much wider audience , with different layers of society , with people from different social economic class , with different levels of education			2

" satire has long been used as a powerful medium for veiled political commentary and political cartoons became a favorite medium for poking fun at authorities			1
the satirical magazine " @entity79 , " an @entity81 language periodical published between 1906 and 1930 enjoyed a wide readership across the @entity83			2
its main character , a bumbling and backwards cleric often depicted in compromising scenarios , resonated with countries grappling with the thorny issue of modernization -- particularly @entity14 , where @entity79 's first year of publication coincided with the @entity92 , an attempt to reform @entity14 's monarchy			1
the country 's first experiment with liberal democracy was ended in 1907 , but @entity79 's jokes lived on inspiring future generations of artists who have used political cartoons to offer subtle social commentary for decades			2
" the reasons cartoons ... have a very strong presence in @entity14 culture is that in some of these cycles of oppression journalists or authors could not write			1
but cartoonists might find ways to express an idea or in a very delicate way , " said @entity29			2
@entity29 believes cartoons have a unique ability to capture complex political problems in a succinct and visually powerful way , making them universally appealing			2

" the scope for public expression has become much wider " said @entity125 , director of the @entity127 and @entity126 at @entity128			2
" people feel much more empowered in being able to express how they feel about autocracy without the fear which used to force them to opt for subtlety			0
" @entity137 , author of the graphic novel " @entity139 as told shortly before it began , " agrees			0
" as recently as three years ago just the fact that i wrote about politics and other social taboos had many of my friends and family worried about my safety and theirs by association , " said @entity137			0
" today you ca n't keep up with all the political jokes , be they cartoons , internet memes or street graffiti			0

@entity161 , founder of the @entity162 and a stand - up comedian who conducts workshops in the @entity83 , said he has witnessed an explosion in the number of local comics in the region			1
but in @entity14 , according to @entity29 , many humorists have been forced to leave the country			1
" over the past seven to eight years , particularly over the past four years , many cartoonists -- like journalists -- have fled the country and live abroad , " he said			0
" they are under constant pressure to make sure their cartoons do not become a reason to harm the newspaper ... there have been newspaper that have been shut down just for having a controversial cartoon			0
" nonetheless , cartoonists in @entity14 are drawing on their creativity to evade censorship , which @entity29 insists makes their work even more powerful			1
" we 're seeing actions become more ambiguous , more general , more interpretative , " he said			0

it 's more appealing , more beautiful			0
