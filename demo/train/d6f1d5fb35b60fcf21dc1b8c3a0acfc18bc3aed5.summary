-- on shaky , grainy video recordings , a group of men show off a stash of pills , pop open @entity7 tall boys and shoot dice for stacks of cash			2
one injects what appears to be heroin ; another displays a large - caliber pistol , ejecting four bullets from the chamber to show that it 's loaded			0
here 's the punchline : these guys are already in jail			2
the scenes were captured in 2009 on a camera smuggled into the @entity24 in @entity25 , a decrepit lockup pressed back into service after @entity27			1
the video 's release during a federal court hearing this week sparked a new demand by the city 's mayor for the federal government to take over the @entity25 prison system and a round of i - told - you - sos by advocates for the inmates held there			1
in addition to the displays of contraband , the inmates in the now - shuttered facility show themselves dishing out soup from bins in grungy , overcrowded cells and sleeping on mattresses laid on floors			1
one holds up glue traps he says are used to catch nutria , a rat - like pest that has infested much of southern @entity56 and notes that the jail was supposed to have been closed			1
" why 're we in here , then ? " he asks			1
" @entity59 investigated , and they told them it 's closed down ... why 're we in here ? " this week 's hearings in @entity63 are part of a lawsuit filed against @entity25 sheriff @entity66			1
attorneys from the @entity68 say @entity66 's neglect led to " brutal and inhumane conditions " for inmates , many of whom are jailed for non-violent misdemeanor offenses			0
" hearing some of the testimony and looking at some of the video of the jail itself , i can not imagine the conditions of any human being living in those conditions , " @entity75 , the father of an inmate who killed himself in the prison two years ago , told @entity0 affilliate @entity78			1
in a statement issued tuesday , @entity66 said he closed the @entity24 in 2012 because of its " state of disrepair and abhorrent lack of proper security measures			2
" " following @entity27 , we were forced to reopen the @entity24 to house inmates , because other inmate facilities were destroyed by the floods			2
it was never meant to be a long - term solution , " @entity66 said			0
" in addition , we have been using eight temporary tents to house inmates			0
these facilities were never meant to be used this long for these purposes			0
" @entity105 district judge @entity104 is weighing whether to approve a settlement with the sheriff 's office that would require the parish to provide appropriate housing , protection and medical care for inmates			2
but @entity25 mayor @entity113 called for a federal receiver to be put in control of the jail after the release of the video , which he said was turned up by the city 's lawyers			1
" it is now clearer than ever that the @entity123 is not keeping the prison secure and our city safe , " @entity113 said in a statement			0
" the people of the city are investing over $ 226 million to build new prison facilities and over $ 30 million each year in the taxpayer money to operate the jail			0
i can not in good conscience cut vital services or raise taxes to put even more money into an office where waste , fraud , and abuse run rampant			0
" @entity0 's @entity141 and @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
