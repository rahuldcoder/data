" i feel like i used to get tested more , i think i was tested 25 times in 2003 , 2004			0
ever since , i think it 's been clearly going down this season			1
" also last year when i won @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , and the year before that , i did n't get tested in one of those three events that i won			0
for me , that 's not okay			2
" you show up and test a guy that 's winning everything			2
that 's sometimes what i struggle with			2
" but overall i trust the system			0
i think they 're all very professional , " the 17 - time grand slam champion told gathered reporters			0

it does n't matter how bad you feel			0
i 'm sorry , " @entity1 said			1
" like the test the next day for me is not a test any more because of what could have happened overnight			0
