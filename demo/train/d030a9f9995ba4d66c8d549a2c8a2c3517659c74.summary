@entity0 -- with the official business of the 57th inauguration out of the way , @entity0 began preparing sunday for a day of revelry -- and for the challenges facing president @entity7 over the next four years			1
satisfying the constitutional obligation to be sworn in on january 20 , @entity7 and vice president @entity8 took quiet oaths the day before the public ceremony at the @entity12 , which is expected to attract a crowd of up to 800,000 on the @entity14			1
@entity7 will become only the 17th @entity16 president to deliver a second inaugural address before leading the traditional parade up @entity19 to the @entity20			2
monday 's events will be smaller than @entity7 's first inauguration in 2009 , when nearly two million people witnessed the swearing - in of the country 's first @entity26 - @entity16 president			1
less intensity this time reflects the reality of second - term presidencies , when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first four years			2
for @entity7 , that difference is even sharper			2
his historic ascent to the @entity20 in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades			0
@entity7 to acknowledge divided @entity0 in inaugural address however , a list of challenges that included an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional @entity49 over budgets and spending only hardened the opposing positions in @entity0			2
@entity7 's signature achievements , including major reforms of the health care industry and @entity55 , became symbols of political division , with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery			1
a second - term @entity7 has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy -- proposals that are bound to spark battles with his @entity49 rivals -- and oversee the implementation of @entity69			1
and the shootings at a @entity72 elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda			0
@entity1 polling released sunday showed a majority of @entity16 -- 54 % -- believe @entity7 will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term , while 43 % said he 'd be poor or below average			2
and while overall , seven in 10 @entity16 hope the president 's policies succeed , only four in 10 @entity49 feel that way , with 52 % hoping that @entity7 will fail			1
@entity7 's senior adviser , @entity84 , said on sunday that " the challenges and opportunities are enormous " in the president 's second term , and that those challenges would be confronted as soon as the inaugural celebrations play out			1
the tone of @entity7 's inaugural address on monday will be " hopeful , " @entity84 told @entity1 on sunday , explaining that @entity7 would " remind the country that our founding principles and values still can guide us in a changing and modern world			1
" 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on @entity1 platforms " he 's going to talk about the fact that our political system does n't require us to resolve all of our disputes or settle all of our differences but it does n't compel us to act where there should n't and is common ground , " @entity84 added			0
" he 's going to make that point very clearly			0
" @entity84 underscored that @entity7 's @entity113 address , to take place february 12 , will present a more specific " blueprint " of the next four years			1
@entity7 's swearing - in on sunday took place in the ornate @entity118 , an oval - shaped reception space in the president 's official residence , where he was joined by his wife , @entity123 , and his two daughters			1
@entity7 placed his left hand on a bible held by mrs. @entity127 that was from her family			2
he then raised his right hand			0
chief justice @entity131 administered the oath - his third time to hold that honor			1
after @entity131 flubbed the order of words during the public ceremony in 2009 , a do - over took place in the @entity140 the next day to erase any question that @entity7 was officially the president			1
@entity143 , @entity142 participate in national day of service @entity131 did n't have any trouble with the oath this time around			0
he read from a white note card			0
@entity147 marks where @entity131 paused to have @entity7 repeat the words were clearly visible			0
the event took less than a minute and @entity7 did n't make any formal remarks or statements			0
he did take a moment to hug his wife and daughters , exclaiming : " i did it ! " justice @entity156 performed the honors for @entity8 at his home at the @entity159 in @entity0 , where the vice president 's extended family and a few @entity163 officials gathered to watch the ceremony			1
