@entity0 -- @entity2 knows firsthand just how difficult coming home from war can be			1
a 1st @entity6 leader and acting company commander in @entity8 , @entity2 experienced the struggles of war and the challenges of readjusting to civilian life			1
now the executive director of @entity14 , @entity2 is working to help the new generation of veterans , mostly from the wars in @entity18 and @entity19 , find jobs			1
" this group [ of veterans ] is extremely well - trained			1
it 's just that they 're coming home to a terrible economy , there are very few jobs for them , and they 're just being dumped out on the street			1
we 're doing our best to change that , " says @entity2 , 67 , who is anticipating increased work as a large - scale drawdown begins			1
almost all of the 40,000 @entity37 troops in @entity18 are on their way home after president @entity41 's order in october to withdraw them by the end of the year			1
through the @entity14 's @entity45 , veterans individually team up with a mentor who helps them on the road to employment			1
they do this through résumé evaluation and improvement , face - to - face meetings , and setting up professional networks for veterans to tap into			2
the nonprofit organization has already helped more than 7,000 returning troops find jobs			1
@entity58 is one of the success stories			0
after graduating from @entity60 in @entity0 , he served in the @entity61 as an @entity63 ( electronic technician third class ) from 2000 to 2004			0
his aircraft carrier , the @entity65 , was sent to the @entity66 in 2003 at the beginning of the war			0
@entity58 , 31 , spent his tour ensuring that the ship 's radar systems were up to date			2
after completing his service and returning home in 2004 , @entity58 was searching for work			1
" i had no guidance from anyone in the military about what i should do next , " @entity58 told @entity1			0
" i also never heard from ( @entity79 ) or other government programs			1
i actually did n't even know they offered anything			0
" through his own efforts , @entity58 found a few short - term jobs as a technician between 2005 and 2008			2
in 2009 , he met @entity86 , @entity14 's @entity45 director			1
@entity86 became @entity58 's mentor and provided support and guidance toward finding employment			2
" he was a huge help			0
he made sure i stayed on top of my applications ; he was there if i needed to call him			0
he also met me and walked with me to my interview locations			0
when i did n't think things were gon na work out , he really stood by me and kept me going			0
" @entity58 is currently a personal banker at @entity98 in @entity0			0
he remains in touch with @entity86 and @entity14			2
his experience is a far cry from @entity2 's			1
in 1969 , @entity2 says , he was spat on by @entity8 protesters at @entity104 in @entity105			2
@entity2 struggled to find a job and traveled to @entity107 to pursue a second degree			1
he enrolled at @entity109 but only stayed for one semester			0
he remembers his first day , sitting in class while students openly criticized him and other @entity37 troops and the war effort			1
when applying for one job at a machinery plant , @entity2 -- he was 24 when he returned from @entity8 -- recalls getting rejected after being told that his résumé did not list any appropriate qualifications			1
" the guy told me i did n't have any civilian experience			0
i was able to get 200 people i did n't know to follow my lead and fight in the jungle , but i supposedly did n't have the experience to get a few people to turn on their machines , " @entity2 told @entity1			2
he described his experience as a hostile reception at a time when many employers did n't look at military experience as a marketable background			0
@entity132 , a college graduate and @entity134 captain in @entity8 from june 1968 to march 1969 , recalls applying for a position as a manager at a @entity138 trucking company			0
" after he looked over my résumé , the interviewer said , ' i 've got a stack of résumés from people who were smart enough to beat the draft , so i 'm not really sure what i can do for you			0
' " both men do , however , see the younger vets receiving more support from the @entity37 public			1
" the difference today is that many people , whether they support the war or not , they 're still showing support for our troops , " @entity2 said			1
@entity158 , director of research and senior fellow at the @entity161 , said that the new generation of veterans is better prepared to enter the labor force			2
he attributes this preparation to a combat experience older veterans did n't have			2
" our soldiers are having to function in many more capacities than they have in the past , " said @entity158			0
" sure they 're expected to fight , but they have to know how to use technology that did n't exist before			0
they have to be leaders amongst their groups of soldiers and amongst the local populations			0
we saw some ' hearts and minds ' type of efforts in @entity8 , but not nearly to the extent we see in these wars			0
all of these factors should be giving them skills they can use when they 're back here			0
" despite the public 's higher support , official government agencies are having a hard time producing tangible success for vets			1
the 2010 unemployment rate among " @entity195 " veterans ( those who served after september 2001 ) was 11.5 % , according to the @entity196			2
that number is a huge increase from the 6.1 % rate of 2007			0
this is in contrast to the national unemployment rate , currently at 9 %			0
" the government and @entity37 businesses are throwing the yellow ribbon sticker on their cars , but they have n't gone forward to do anything , " said @entity203 , who founded @entity14 in 1996 at the request of then - president @entity205			1
veterans are simply guided to online portals , where they submit hundreds of copies of their résumés to jobs found on a list			2
many applicants never hear back from the companies they apply to and have no other means of looking for work			0
" one glaring omission from the government 's programs ( is ) that they provide no real network for our veterans , " said @entity203			1
" it 's one thing if you 're an officer and you 've got a college degree and a network to lean on , but it 's totally different for the majority of vets , who do n't have a degree and are left to fend for themselves			1
" at any given time , @entity14 , headquartered in @entity0 , has mentors in place for 200 veterans			1
roughly 52 % are @entity240 , 35 % @entity241 , 10 % @entity242 , and 3 % a mixture of @entity244 and @entity245 , according to @entity86			0
about 15 % of the veterans are women .			2
