-- if you are a coffee lover you might be tempted to pay for a cup of the most expensive coffee in the world			1
@entity6 's velvety tasting brew , @entity5 , gives new meaning to rich coffee			1
it can cost up to $ 50 per cup			1
" the supply is very limited in the world that makes the price is very expensive , " @entity5 brand managing director @entity11 said			1
the reason the supply is limited has to do with how the beans are initially processed			2
just a warning here , it is n't pretty			0
@entity5 means coffee in @entity6 and @entity21 is a wild @entity23 palm civet , a fury creature that looks like a cross between a cat and a ferret			1
the civet climbs the coffee trees to find the best berries , eats them , digests the berries and eventually out comes the coffee beans in its stools			2
farmers then pick up the civet droppings and take the beans to a processing plant			2
something about the gastric juices in the civet 's stomach gives @entity5 its unique flavor			1
" i do like it			0
compared to other kinds of coffee , it has a more distinctive coffee taste and aroma , " customer @entity45 said as he sipped his coffee after watching the ritual of making a cup of the expensive brew			1
at a @entity56 in @entity57 the staff brings out a gold - lined cup , a hot thermos of water and vacuum packed sealed package of the @entity5			1
the package is opened and poured into the cup and then the hot water is poured in			2
it is stirred and then covered			0
you have to wait two minutes before sipping it			0
when i first saw it being made i recoiled			0
i thought : " i 'm paying all this money for instant coffee , no way ! " but after taking the first sip i felt a little better			2
it is very smooth with hints of chocolate and caramel flavors and it does n't have that acidic aftertaste that coffee sometimes does			0
for years it has been more popular overseas than in @entity6 but that is fast changing as the economy in the country continues to grow at a rate far faster than those in the west			1
" we opened @entity56 in 2002 and already have 20 stores , " @entity11 said			0
it has become even more popular around the world after it was featured on " @entity104 " and in the @entity95 movie " @entity96 " where @entity98 's character was obsessed with it ( not knowing of course what made it so special until the end )			1
@entity5 's growing popularity and the way its made has run into trouble			1
it has been given some nasty names such as " crappuccino " and inspired two of @entity114 main @entity113 organizations to consider putting a fatwa on it because the process appeared to be ritually unclean			0
but that all changed , @entity11 said , after a bit of explanation about the bean when it is excreted			0
" it still has the skin , inner layer			0
and we do the cleansing process , before we do processing and roasting			0
it 's not a problem			0
and now , the @entity5 is certified halal , " he said			2
and it is being enjoyed for a heck of a lot less in its home country than elsewhere			0
a cup costs about $ 8 in @entity6 as opposed to up to $ 50 in other countries			1
" i feel it 's the type of thing you have to do once at least , " an @entity140 customer who happened to visiting @entity6 said .			2

@entity5 is the world 's most expensive coffee
brewed from beans that have been *semi-digested* by palm civets
can cost up to $ 50 per cup outside of @entity6
becoming more popular in @entity6 among *affluent* *members* of *society*
