-- the cold has cleared the sunbathing crowds from @entity4 's beaches , yet the freezing temperatures wo n't keep some surfers out of the water			1
they have grown up with " ice cream headaches " -- the painful ache when you eat something cold too fast -- they are the surfers from @entity4			0
" i 've had times when icicles form in my hair , " says surfer @entity13			0
even the smallest waves will have the hardcore surfer walking over the snow - covered sand to take advantage of the power of the chilly @entity23			0
for years , professional surfer and cancer survivor @entity24 has been among those in the frigid waters , wearing a full wet suit , hoodie , gloves and booties			1
" you just deal with your surroundings , " says @entity24 , " if you love something so much you just keep doing it			2
" @entity24 kept surfing year - round and it paid off in 1990 when he started making a living off the ocean			1
early in his career at contests around the world , he would often be asked , " are there waves in @entity4 ? " as filmmaker @entity44 shows in his newly released surfing documentary " @entity46 " , not only is the surf good in @entity4 , but there are a lot of good surfers in the state			1
the movie credits @entity24 , a @entity4 native , with proving that @entity54 surfers are worthy contenders			1
" he has absolutely paved the way for any surfer that wants to become a professional from @entity4 , " says @entity44			0
@entity24 now just started his own line of surfboards			2
@entity13 -- the narrator of " @entity46 " and a professional surfer -- concurs , " @entity24 is our big brother , coming from @entity4 you do n't have a lot of people that have made the impression that @entity24 has			1
" it was the impression of a surfer and a state that took years for @entity24 to change			2
the money to be made in surfing comes from sponsors , appearances and editorial photographs			2
only a few in the profession make enough money in surf contests to support themselves			0
@entity24 became a professional surfer in 1990 , yet he still could n't find a sponsor to support him			2
a sponsor pays the athletes to use or wear their product and they usually pick up the expenses incurred when traveling to contests			0
@entity24 could n't find a sponsor to believe in him , no one wanted to get behind a surfer from the @entity90 " i had to win money , " recalls @entity24 , " there were places on the tour when i was n't eating if i did n't win money in that contest , or i did n't have a plane ticket home			1
" winning money meant winning contests and in 1996 @entity24 became just one of 44 surfers to qualify for the @entity103			1
" somehow i managed to do that with no sponsorship , " says @entity24 , then dryly adding the word " barely			2
" he also managed to put credibility into the @entity4 surf scene			0
" @entity24 has paved the way , " @entity44 says , " there 's never been a surfer from @entity4 or the @entity112 that 's made the @entity113			0
" the success @entity24 has enjoyed is no surprise when you learn a bit more about this @entity4 boy			0
fighting to be respected in the surf scene was nothing compared to the four battles @entity24 fought and won against cancer			1
it was in 2001 when he was first diagnosed with @entity124 , a cancer of the lymph nodes			0
" everyone has their hometown hero , but in this case @entity24 's just like a state hero , " says @entity44 , " he 's even motivation for people who are n't from @entity4 because of his fights , his battles			1
" when @entity24 is n't in the water he uses his celebrity status along with the sport he loves to raise money for the @entity141			1
currently residing in @entity142 , @entity24 frequently returns to @entity4			0
not forgetting where he came from , the foundation sponsors an annual event called " @entity148 " in his hometown of @entity147			0
" it 's just one of those events that everybody wants to support even if they 're not surfing , they want to support @entity24 , " says @entity149 , a @entity4 surfer and the owner of @entity149 's @entity151			2
as the film " @entity46 " points out , it is because of @entity24 that being a surfer from @entity4 is no longer , as he puts it , " like trying to be a professional snowboarder and growing up in @entity162			1
" @entity163 does n't have snow but as captured in this new surf film , @entity4 definitely has waves			0
the state also experiences winter and that freezing season is what separates the surfing fraud from the fanatic			0
