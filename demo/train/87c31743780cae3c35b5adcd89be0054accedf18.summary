-- @entity2 disc jockey @entity1 told an interviewer that " prank calls are made every day on every radio station in every country around the world , and they have been for a long time , and no one could have imagined this to happen			1
" he was talking about the suicide of @entity11 , a nurse who was on the receiving end of a prank call he made with co-host @entity15			1
they pretended to be prince @entity17 and @entity18 phoning @entity19 in @entity20 to find out the condition of the @entity22 , who had been admitted for a severe case of morning sickness			1
@entity25 apparently felt so humiliated by falling for the ruse that she took her own life			1
i 'm not an expert in mental health , so i 'm not in a position to evaluate the extent to which the radio station 's gag played a role in @entity25 's death			1
but i do have proof that it 's possible for disc jockeys to play a practical joke on someone without anyone getting hurt			0
in 1993 , morning radio personality @entity44 from @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , began posing as a rustic , angry fellow named @entity49			1
he 'd call unsuspecting folks in the community and tell them they 'd committed some injustice against him , such as selling him a burrito that created stomach trouble at the christening of his grandniece			1
@entity49 's outrageous demands for retribution quickly led to threats of an " a * * - whuppin ' , " but just as the person on the receiving end was about to blow his stack , @entity44 and co-host @entity66 let the patsy in on the joke			2
everyone has a good laugh , and no one was worse for wear			0
the @entity74 character has developed a huge following across the country through cds sold at truck stops , but i 'd never heard of him until a music subscription service recommended him after i listened to an album by @entity81			0
from the moment i heard the first track , i was hooked , and i ended up playing every album more times than i can count -- as my beleaguered wife will attest			0
for samples of @entity74 calls , click on menu 's " speed dial " whatever the supposed injustice that @entity49 encountered , the result was always the same : a request for an outrageous sum of money to right the wrong , followed by the threat of violence , and ending with the recipient of the call being informed that the whole thing was a ruse set up by a friend			2
@entity104 's interview with @entity44 and @entity66 the @entity2 djs ' mistake was not the making of the call , which done artfully might indeed have been funny			1
rather , they erred in not letting the person who took the call know that the whole thing was a joke			2
whether this would have prevented @entity114 's suicide is hard to say			0
perhaps she was so troubled that the slightest upset would have brought about her tragic choice			0
but this sad story should be a wake - up call for radio hosts around the world to follow the @entity49 model of prank calls : let the person in on the joke before things spiral out of control			1
the ethical principle at the heart of this policy is simple : do no harm			2
we associate this principle with health care professionals , and rightly so : we 'd like our physicians to make us better			2
but at the very least , we can expect that they wo n't make us worse			0
the @entity138 principle is a bedrock of ethics courses every would - be medical , nursing , dental and pharmacy student must take to graduate			1
yet do no harm applies not just to health care providers but to radio personalities , their producers and everyone else			2
what would the world be like if we could n't be confident that people we encounter will not harm us , and that they will be punished if they willfully do so ? no one would want to leave home , and as we learn from @entity0 daily , too many folks around the world live in such fear			0
of course , terrorists , dictators and other despots violate the @entity138 principle regularly , which is why it makes sense to speak of just wars			1
even one of our most notable advocates of peace , sir @entity165 , responded to 9/11 with a song whose chorus goes , " we will fight for the right to live in freedom			0
" still , the fact that some or even a lot of people intentionally cause harm every day does not mean that @entity138 is an unrealistic guideline for living responsibly			1
even if many people do @entity175 , if does n't follow that x is right or good			0
disc jockey @entity1 may be correct that prank calls are part and parcel of radio programs around the world			2
but the public still has a right to demand that media professionals avoid doing or saying things that would reasonably cause others to feel humiliated or degraded			0
i call upon radio hosts , producers and station owners in every country to formally adopt the @entity138 principle in their employment policies , so that incidents like the royal hoax can be avoided			1
on a sad note , @entity66 , who helped to write much of @entity49 's material , died a few weeks ago			0
his death was not related to the pranks he pulled , but it did galvanize people across the country to mourn the loss of a good - natured fellow whose practical jokes were both funny and respectful			0
his final cd , " @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 , " will be released next month by @entity207 / @entity206			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity104 .			1

nurse *killed* herself after she fell for @entity2 djs ' hoax call to @entity22
@entity218 : radio pranks are here to stay , but @entity216 can *soften* the humiliation
one radio show played *hilarious* pranks , he says , but later let the patsy in on it
@entity104 : principle of " @entity138 " should guide us in our dealings in jobs , life
