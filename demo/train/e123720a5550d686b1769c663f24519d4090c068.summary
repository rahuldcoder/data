editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity4 contributor on national security issues , formerly served as president @entity8 's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser			1
@entity9 has spent more than two decades in the fields of intelligence and criminal justice and has served during the past three administrations			1
@entity9 is currently a consultant to the @entity15 @entity14 and a member of president @entity8 's @entity17 , the @entity19 and the @entity20			1
@entity2 says the director of the @entity22 is not a post for on - the - job training			1
( @entity4 ) -- @entity25 is an impressive man with many laudable achievements to his credit			2
mr. @entity25 served eight terms in @entity29 and worked in the @entity30 as chief of staff to the president and director of the @entity34			1
but his impressive credentials are insufficient to allay the well - founded concerns of senior @entity37 and @entity38 that he is the wrong man to be the next director of the @entity22			1
mr. @entity25 is a seasoned political operative and a proven manager -- both of which would be useful to him as @entity22 director -- but more is required			1
accurate and actionable intelligence is among our most effective tools in fighting against terror threats			0
the nation has gone more than seven years without a terrorist attack and much of the credit for that lies with the men and women of the intelligence community : in the @entity22 , @entity58 , and @entity59 departments , among others			2
career intelligence officials need a leader they can count on to protect their mission from inappropriate political interference and who would be willing to defend their efforts when , as is often the case , they are attacked based on less than accurate or complete facts			2
because of the critical role the intelligence community plays in protecting our nation , the director of the @entity22 is not a position for on - the - job training			1
president - elect @entity75 had a competent , qualified career intelligence official to nominate			2
@entity77 served for decades at the @entity22 under numerous directors and in both @entity37 and @entity38 administrations			2
just prior to his retirement , mr. @entity77 served as the director of the @entity82 , the predecessor to the current @entity84			0
@entity77 had no loyalty to the policies of the @entity8 administration and in fact at times voiced his disagreement			0
mr. @entity77 's loyalty was to the mission and role of the intelligence community in protecting our nation			0
unfortunately , the incoming administration permitted the vicissitudes of party politics and special interests to derail this nomination			0
[ in a letter to @entity75 obtained by @entity4 in early december , @entity77 said he was dropping out of consideration for the job because of strong criticism by people who associated his work at the @entity22 with controversial @entity8 administration policies on interrogation techniques and the pre-emptive war in @entity110			2
] the next @entity22 director has many important issues to confront			1
he or she must continue to ensure adequate resources for the intelligence community and continue to build our human and technical intelligence capabilities			0
the new director will necessarily review detention , interrogation and rendition policies			0
and at the same time , the @entity22 director must seek new ways to gain the intelligence advantage on crucial priorities such as terrorism , proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and a host of regional issues in the @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			1
regardless of who becomes the next @entity22 director , the nation is fortunate that from the deputy director on down , the @entity22 is run by career officials who will continue to do the nation 's business			1
but they will continue to require the tools necessary to do the job			0
before abrogating @entity146 policies on interrogation and detention , the new @entity22 director must learn : what is legal ; what is effective ; and how have these policies been implemented			1
a new administration may choose to make more limited use of these tools or add additional procedural safeguards			0
but any decision must be made with caution			0
tools that the @entity159 deem legal and the intelligence community determines are effective must not be taken away because they are politically unpopular			0
the nation and the intelligence community deserve better and must be led with the same courage that they have displayed			0
president - elect @entity75 is off to a strong start , taking daily intelligence briefings and asking probing questions			2
if mr. @entity25 is to be the next @entity22 director , he will need to earn the trust , confidence and respect of career intelligence officials			1
mr. @entity25 will need these career intelligence officers to best advise the new president on the @entity22 capabilities at his disposal to support critical foreign policy and national security objectives			1
the most important objective will remain protecting @entity15 lives			2
mr. @entity25 is smart and no doubt a quick study			0
let 's pray if he is confirmed that he is up to the difficult job ahead of him			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity25 has had a fine career in government
she says his lack of intelligence experience is raising questions
@entity9 : @entity22 crucial to @entity15 security and needs leader who will back staff up
she says @entity22 director is too important for on - the - job training
