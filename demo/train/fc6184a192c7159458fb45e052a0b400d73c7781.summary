-- on tuesday , the @entity1 released its update to the budget and economic outlook			1
many in the media got it wrong			2
this is n't the first time that 's happened			0
in early 2011 , after winning a decisive victory in the @entity11 , the newly @entity13 @entity12 brought @entity14 -- a legislation that would repeal @entity16 -- up for a vote			2
it was called " repealing the @entity19			0
" it was named under the notion that the @entity16 would result in the loss of millions of jobs			1
the claim was based on a @entity1 report on the @entity26 published in summer 2010			1
but the words " job killing " never appeared in the report			0
what was said ( on page 48 for those interested ) , was that the @entity16 would reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by about one - half of 1 % , mostly " by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply			1
" the fact that there would be a reduction in the supply of labor was because the @entity16 would provide benefits to people			1
giving some people @entity49 and others subsidies to help them pay for insurance would leave some people more flush with resources			0
they might choose to work fewer hours , or not at all			0
a number of people just under age 65 might have liked to retire before the @entity16 , but they knew they could n't get insurance without a job			1
since the @entity16 now would guarantee them more affordable options , they might choose to retire earlier			1
also , a number of would - be entrepreneurs might have liked to have struck out on their own , but feared they would n't be able to get insurance for the same reason			0
the @entity16 would protect them			2
they might leave their jobs to start businesses			0
all these projections are considered by most people to be good things			2
but they all result in people voluntarily leaving the work force			0
they constitute a reduction in labor , caused by the @entity16			1
and that 's what the @entity1 was talking about			2
but opponents of the @entity16 spun this into something bad			0
and so the " job - killing " meme was born			0
flash forward to february 4 , 2014			0
the @entity1 updated its @entity87 for 2014 through 2024			1
once again , the @entity1 reported that there would be a reduction in the labor force because workers will choose to work less because of the benefits they receive			1
in fact , the @entity1 thinks that these choices will result in a reduction in the labor force of about 2 million fewer full time positions in 2017			1
this time the key passage is on page 117 - 8 : " the estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers will choose to supply , rather than from a net drop in businesses ' demand for labor , so it will appear almost entirely as a reduction in labor force participation and in hours worked relative to what would have occurred otherwise rather than as an increase in unemployment ( that is , more workers seeking but not finding jobs ) or underemployment ( such as part - time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week )			1
" again , for many people this is a good thing			1
the @entity16 is letting some people who would rather stay at home -- perhaps to raise their children -- do so because benefits are improving			1
it 's letting people who want to retire early do so because they do n't have to wait for @entity126			0
these things are consequences the people who wrote the law intended , and the @entity1 reports them as such			2
i understand why opponents of the @entity16 have long tried to twist these facts to support a position that declares the @entity16 is hurting the economy and increasing unemployment			0
but i 'm baffled as to why the media failed to see that the key piece of evidence , the @entity1 report , did n't uphold their claims			2
there 's a big difference between a reduction in the supply of labor and a reduction in the demand for labor			2
it 's time we all learned the difference			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .			0

the @entity1 updated its budget and economic outlook ; many in the media got it wrong
@entity154 : the claim that @entity1 projects millions of jobs lost because of @entity16 is false
he says @entity1 says there will be a reduction in supply of labor ; this is actually a good thing
@entity154 : because @entity16 would provide benefits , people can choose to stop working
