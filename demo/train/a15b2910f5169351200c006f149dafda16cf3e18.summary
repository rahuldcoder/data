one step , 128,100 feet , and millions of amazed gasps			2
in a moment that seems likely to live forever in the annals of derring - do , @entity3 daredevil @entity2 on sunday rode a balloon to the edge of space , saluted and stepped off a platform 24 miles high with as much ease as any of us mere mortals might step off a curb			1
the former soldier hurtled through the sky at up to more than 830 mph , breaking the sound barrier in a tumbling , gut - churning four - minute free fall before popping his parachute and making a running landing in the @entity23 desert			1
then he fell to his knees and pumped his fists			2
" goosebumps ... incredible ! " one @entity27 user posted shortly after the jump			1
how claustrophobia almost grounded him " my dad told me of @entity37 and @entity38 , i will tell my children of @entity40 and @entity2 , " another user wrote , referring to @entity33 soccer stars and the first man to walk on the moon			2
@entity41 carried the jump live			1
at least 8 million people watched live , @entity41 said			0
while the jump was spectacle enough on its own , it also could have important implications for spaceflight			1
launching of @entity2 's balloon - lifted capsule the 100 - pound pressurized flight suit and helmet @entity2 wore to survive the lethally thin atmosphere and intense cold of near - space could also help save the lives of astronauts forced to bail out of a malfunctioning rocket on its way to space			1
" it 's hard to realize what happened because there 's still so many emotions , " @entity2 said shortly after landing			0
" i had tears in my eyes when i was coming back a couple of times because you 're sitting there and you thought about that moment so many times , you know , how it would feel and how it would look like			0
" " and this is way bigger than i had anticipated , " he said			1
dubbed " @entity2 , " the helicopter pilot and former soldier had parachuted from such landmarks as the @entity79 in @entity80 and the @entity82 statue in @entity83			0
@entity2 and his team spent five years preparing for sunday 's jump , which had been postponed twice before because of weather			1
not the only man to break the sound barrier that day by most accounts , all the hard work paid off			1
according to preliminary findings cited by @entity92 , an official observer monitoring the mission , the 43 - year - old @entity2 flew higher than anyone ever in a helium balloon and broke the record for the highest jump			1
still , even @entity2 seemed taken aback when @entity92 detailed how fast he had fallen at one point -- 833.9 mph , or @entity99 , smashing his goal to break the sound barrier			1
" i was fighting all the way down to regain control because i wanted to break the speed of sound , " said @entity2			1
" and then i hit it			1
" after a weather delay of several hours , he set off at 9:30 a.m. ( 11:30 a.m. et ) sunday from @entity107 , @entity23 , in breezy , clear conditions , strapped into a pressurized capsule that hung from a giant helium balloon			1
it took two hours to reach his target altitude			0
after running through a 40 - step checklist , @entity2 opened the hatch and climbed out onto a step the size of a skateboard			2
" guardian angels will take care of you , " said @entity118 just before he jumped			0
" the whole world is watching now , " @entity2 responded			0
he experienced a few hitches			0
about three minutes in , he reported , " my visor is fogging up			0
" then he began to veer into a " flat spin " that threatened to send blood rushing to his head and leave him out of control			0
" there was a period of time where i really thought , ' i am in trouble , ' " @entity2 said , recalling how he considered pushing a button that would have released a drogue chute , slowing and stabilizing his descent -- and scuttling the attempt to break the sound barrier			1
" but after a couple of seconds , i had that feeling i 'm getting it under control			0
and i did , " he added			0
" and that 's why i broke the speed of sound today			1
" opinion : the space adventure you ca n't miss after free - falling for about four minutes and 20 seconds , he deployed a parachute for the final mile or two down to @entity152			2
" there 's the chute , " said a specialist in @entity118 , and the control room broke into applause			0
as soon as @entity2 landed , he dropped to his knees and raised his fists			0
the team at @entity118 in @entity107 burst into applause			0
while he and his team had prepared diligently for the jump , his survival was no guarantee			2
in addition to the risk of spinning out of control , @entity2 's life depended on the integrity of his pressure suit			0
the temperature when he jumped was expected to hit 70 degrees below zero @entity173 or lower			2
and the atmosphere was so thin that his blood would have vaporized if he was n't sufficiently protected			1
testing that pressurized flight suit and helmet was one goal of the mission , as it could save an astronaut 's life if a manned spacecraft malfunctioned			0
the outfit had sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate			2
sunday 's successful jump breaks the record set in 1960 by col. @entity191 , who fell from 102,800 feet as part of a @entity195 @entity194 mission			1
@entity191 was a consultant on @entity2 's effort , serving as the lone person from @entity118 talking to the @entity3 throughout his attempt			1
@entity191 acknowledged the ups and downs of the years - long effort sunday			2
the former aviator was all smiles in lauding @entity2 , who he said " did perfect , " and all the others involved in making the mission a success			0
" it was a team effort , and @entity2 did a fantastic job , " @entity191 said			0
" it was an honor for all of us to work with this brave guy			0
" skydiver aims for supersonic jump from the edge of space			2

" this is way bigger than i had anticipated , " record - setting jumper says
he *soared* up to 24 miles -- for the highest balloon ride and highest jump ever
then the @entity3 daredevil hit 833.9 mph at one point , breaking the speed of sound
risks were low temperatures , thin atmosphere and a possible loss of *consciousness*
