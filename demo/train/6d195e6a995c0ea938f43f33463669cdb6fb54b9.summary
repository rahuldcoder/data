a little more than 400 years ago a king of @entity1 , @entity2 , was informed by one of his judges , @entity3 , that while the king was under no man , he was under @entity7 and the law			0
this was one of the earliest and most powerful suggestions that our legal system ( borrowed from the @entity1 ) had , as its core principle , that there must be some restraint on arbitrary power			0
ours is supposed to be a government , as @entity20 wrote in the @entity21 of 1780 , of laws and not of men			0
what the health care ruling means to you in what will go down as one of the most important @entity32 decisions of the 21st century , a majority of the justices have affirmed that most noble and important of @entity34 legal maxims			1
but the court 's opinion , in preserving the @entity37 , under @entity39 ' taxing power , still gives a virtually unlimited sway to the power of the federal government			1
the court 's opinion is a long one , and will be carefully parsed by legal scholars , but the bottom line is not difficult to discern			0
chief justice @entity47 has , whether he makes it clear in his opinion or not , chosen to leave the determination of the scope of @entity39 ' powers to @entity39 itself , and to the @entity55 people , who place their representatives in @entity39			1
how the @entity32 voted , what they wrote the argument against the @entity37 was that the individual mandate , by requiring virtually all adult @entity55 to buy health insurance or pay a penalty , could not be justified under the commerce power , because instead of regulating commerce , the act was an attempt to compel participation in commerce			1
the chief justice and justices @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 all now concede that that argument was correct , and that there must be some limits to the power of the federal government when it seeks to regulate interstate commerce			1
this was the clear holding of prior @entity32 cases as well			2
but with the chief justice 's turning to the taxing power to justify the individual mandate , what his opinion takes away under the @entity88 , is , in effect , given back			1
this is particularly disappointing , because the authors of the @entity37 , and its defenders , such as president @entity93 , repeatedly assured the @entity55 people that it was a measure that would reduce costs , not increase them , and that the act was not an attempt to raise taxes			2
breaking down the court 's decision a tax measure is less politically palatable than an " individual mandate , " and had the penalty provisions of the individual mandate been frankly acknowledged to be a tax , it would have been more difficult to pass the act , perhaps even impossible , given the closeness of the margin by which it was enacted			2
some court watchers repeatedly said that the chief justice did not want to render a decision which , by finding the @entity37 unconstitutional , would plunge the court once again into the political thicket it encountered in 2000 with @entity116			2
what @entity47 has done in this case seems to prove those observers correct			0
a health care victory that 's only a start the court has paid some lip service to the principle that ours is a government of laws , not of men , and that the @entity127 exists to reign in arbitrary power			1
there are four justices -- @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 -- who seem sincere in that belief			0
i wish i could say that i believe @entity47 is as well			0
what the court has failed to do in this case must be corrected by the @entity55 people themselves			2
it is now for @entity39 , perhaps , to reconsider this unwise act , which unduly expands the reach of the central government , and unwisely restricts the liberty of the @entity55 people			1
ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides the decision is also a reminder of the sad truth that our constitutional liberties hang by too slender a thread			0
there is now a new and potent issue to be considered in the upcoming election , and that is , which candidate will have an opportunity to shift the precarious balance of the justices on the court			0
it is unconscionable for 5 - 4 majorities to alter the meaning of the @entity127 , and to shift the basis @entity39 has given for legislation			1
one can only hope that after this november the likelihood of this happening again will be less .			0

the @entity55 @entity32 has *upheld* the health care law in 5 - 4 ruling
@entity172 : the ruling unduly expands the reach of the federal government
he says chief justice 's turning to the taxing power to justify the law is disappointing
@entity172 : it is now up to @entity39 to reconsider this unwise act
