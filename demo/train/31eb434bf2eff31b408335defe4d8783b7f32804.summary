@entity0 -- just days after reports that @entity4 police fired on a group of @entity6 marking the @entity8 's birthday , one of @entity4 's most senior officials vowed to continue with the fight against the exiled @entity6 leader			1
" @entity8 has long been engaged in secessionist activities , which run against both the common interests of people of various ethnic groups and the traditions of @entity26 , " said @entity13 , a member of the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) @entity16 , in a report by the state - run @entity19 news agency			1
he then called for an " absolute fight " against what he termed " the @entity8 clique " as a means of protecting @entity4 unification			1
" only when the @entity8 publicly announces that @entity32 is an inalienable part of @entity4 since ancient time , gives up the stance of ' @entity32 independence ' and stops his secessionist activities , can his relations with the @entity39 possibly be improved , " @entity13 added			1
he was speaking during a visit tuesday to a largely @entity6 area of the western province of @entity43			1
the @entity8 , who fled to @entity44 in 1959 after a failed uprising , has long denied @entity4 's assertion that he 's seeking @entity6 independence			2
he says he wants only enough autonomy to protect its traditional @entity50 culture			0
@entity51 rejects accusations of oppression , saying that under its rule , living standards have greatly improved for the @entity6 people			0
it makes centuries - old historical claims on the region			0
meanwhile , @entity62 - based @entity6 advocacy group , @entity32 , has claimed a @entity26 was shot in the head , while at least six others received gunshot wounds , when @entity4 security forces opened fire on a crowd in @entity69 in northwestern @entity70 on july 6			2
they were reportedly celebrating the @entity8 's 78th birthday at a sacred mountain			1
according to the @entity77 - based @entity76 , large numbers of armed troops were deployed and attempted to prevent people from making their offerings and gatherings			0
then without warning , according to several @entity6 sources the group said , police opened fire on the unarmed crowd and used tear - gas			0
@entity1 could not confirm the authenticity of these reports , while @entity4 officials could not be reached for comment			0
in recent years , reports have circulated about a growing number of @entity6 setting themselves on fire in protest against @entity4 rule			0
so far , more than 100 people have resorted to self - immolation , @entity6 advocacy groups have said			2
independently verifying reported self - immolations inside @entity4 is often difficult because of restrictions on reporting from the restive areas and the reluctance of local officials to comment on the accounts provided by foreign groups such as @entity32 .			2

@entity13 was speaking during a visit to western @entity43 province
said talks will only start when @entity8 gives up ' @entity32 independence ' stance
