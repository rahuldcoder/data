one popular theory is that the show could follow a grown - up @entity22 as he deals with a family of his own			2
it also is n't known if any other characters from the original series would be part of the spinoff , or if any of the original cast members are attached			2
@entity15 , at least , does n't seem opposed to the idea			1
when he shared news of the pitch on @entity34 , he added in the caption , " would be nice , would n't it ? " " @entity1 " premiered in 1987 and went on to have 11 seasons , becoming the first prime - time series to air on @entity39 and one of the network 's first breakout hits			1
