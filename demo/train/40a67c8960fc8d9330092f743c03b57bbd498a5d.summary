-- if any place on earth was likely to erect a statue to the critic , it may be @entity6			1
this year , cinema 's most famous critic - turned - director , @entity7 , competes for the @entity9 at the age of 83 with his first 3d - film " @entity12 " -- and the current crop of critics will deliver their verdicts in print , on radio , on television and online to audiences around the world			1
loved and loathed in equal measure , these cinematic scribblers can influence film fans ' decisions on whether or not to buy a ticket to the movie theater , so even in a world becoming increasingly dominated by amateur critics on social media there 's still a degree of responsibility in delivering honest , considered opinion			2
@entity0 asked @entity35 , film critic of the respected @entity37 newspaper " @entity36 " ( @entity38 ) , for his take on @entity6 and the role of the critic			1
@entity35 : first of all , i never felt that critics have all the power			2
i 'm just a film lover and i take that from my experience i 'm entitled to talk a little authoritatively about films , that 's all			1
if ' @entity50 was a marvellous film and the critics say it 's bad film it will still be successful			2
but in this case -- and it 's not always the case -- both audience and critics were united in saying ' oh no ! ' @entity0 : so what exactly do you see as your role ? @entity62 : it 's something that humanity does n't really need but it makes life easier because if you trust certain critics then you can say ' ok , he says it 's a good film and i never agree with him therefore it 's a bad film and the other way around			1
so that 's the way that criticism works			2
@entity0 : so you 're providing a public service ? @entity62 : exactly			2
but i 'm not a servant			0
i 'm only responsible to myself			0
@entity0 : @entity77 , the composer , is often quoted as saying noone ever set up a statue to a critic			1
do you sometimes think they should ? @entity62 : not to me , anyway			0
i think it may well happen some day			0
not in @entity37 , where i come from , not in the @entity84 and not in @entity85 but perhaps here in @entity87			0
@entity0 : they take them seriously here ? @entity62 : they take them seriously and they 're right to do so but let 's just say i 'm not suffering from not enough exposure			2
@entity0 : so what do you enjoy about @entity6 ? @entity62 : i enjoy @entity6 as i always enjoy @entity6 as the only place on earth where you have the chance to see really exciting films nowadays			1
you do n't always get them but let 's say one out of five films i see here are really exciting and that 's a much better quota than anywhere else			1
@entity0 : tell me about one of your favorites in the competition			0
@entity62 : i feel that ' @entity114 , ' the film by the @entity113 director @entity112 is completely out of time			0
it is talky , it is long -- about three hours -- it is slow but it 's an excellent film			0
@entity0 : and that 's the film you like , right ? @entity62 : that 's the film that i like			1
it 's not @entity112 's masterpiece but i like it exactly because it is not of our times			0
it is against the times , it is not quick , it is not superficial and all that is something that you get very rarely these days			0
and that 's it 's main quality apart from the fact that it 's masterfully crafted			0
@entity0 : finally , how would you sum up in @entity6 in three words ? @entity62 : @entity139 , ambitious and sometimes fulfilling !			1

at @entity142 , at least , the film critic is still alive and *kicking*
@entity0 's @entity144 speaks with @entity146 critic for @entity37 daily @entity36
of criticism , @entity35 says : @entity149 does n't really need it but it makes life easier
he added : @entity6 is the only place on earth where you can see really exciting films today
