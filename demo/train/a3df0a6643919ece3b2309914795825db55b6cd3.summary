-- despite the global financial crisis , @entity2 's rich are getting richer			1
" as of april this year , @entity2 has 960,000 millionaires with personal assets of 10 million yuan ( us $ 1.5 million ) , " says @entity4 , chairman of the @entity5 , which compiles @entity2 's rich list			1
" it has 60,000 super-rich with 100 million yuan assets , and their numbers keep growing , " he says			2
the newly affluent are getting more outwardly mobile , too			0
nearly half of them are thinking of emigrating overseas , according to a @entity5 report			1
about 14 per cent of them have or are in the process of applying for emigration , it said			0
" in @entity2 , emigration refers also to getting a permanent residency , or a ' green card ' , " @entity4 explains			1
" we estimate this to make up 80 % of the total who want to ' emigrate '			0
" many businessmen are capitalizing on this trend			0
among them is @entity31 , founder and chairman of @entity33 , one of the leading immigration consulting companies in @entity2			1
born and bred in @entity36 , @entity31 went to @entity37 in 1985 for post-graduate studies			0
he stayed until 1995 when he decided to return to @entity36			0
" @entity2 's economy then was changing rapidly , " he recalled			1
" i asked myself , what does @entity37 have to offer @entity2 ? maple syrup and immigration			1
i could n't sell syrup so i got into the immigration business			0
" his business has grown the past 17 years			0
@entity33 now employs 500 people who work in 10 major cities across @entity2 , handling immigration and student visa applications			1
the company charges 12,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan to help clients secure student and immigrant visas			0
" over the years we 've helped more than 10,000 applicants for immigration , " @entity31 says , including many millionaires			0
but why are @entity2 's newly affluent seeking to emigrate ? some do so for convenience , experts say			1
" a foreign passport makes it a lot easier for them to travel around the world , " @entity31 says			0
" they do n't want to go through tedious visa applications all the time			0
" @entity2 's new rich -- a mixed group of @entity67 capitalists , young tycoons and up - and - coming " fuerdai " ( second - generation capitalist scions ) -- are typically cosmopolitan and tech - savvy , frequent travelers who are willing to pay a premium for convenience			1
they are also ready to spend on education for their children to give them a competitive edge in a new kind of rat race , in which millions of @entity2 are striving for advancement			1
@entity31 remembers the case of @entity82 , 44 , a longtime client who emigrated to @entity37 more than 10 years ago and who refers to the move as " the best decision i 've ever made in my life			0
" @entity89 's teenage son did not excel at school in @entity2 , but after entering the @entity91 he blossomed and is now doing well in @entity37			1
@entity89 , a real estate mogul , is still doing a lucrative business in @entity2			1
likewise , many @entity2 millionaires who apply for @entity96 " alien investor 's visa " -- applicants have to commit $ 500,000 to $ 1 million in capital investment -- seek permanent resident status there so their children will have easier access to @entity96 education			1
" in the long run , after their children complete their undergrad or graduate studies , they would have the opportunity to compete for jobs without having to find an employer willing to sponsor them for @entity96 work visas , " says @entity101 , an immigration lawyer based in @entity102			2
a small percentage of the applicants , she adds , intend to operate their own businesses in the @entity96 after they obtain permanent resident status			1
he says some millionaires opt to leave to escape @entity2 's insufficient medical care , pollution and food safety			1
" there is also an element of insurance against economic , social and potential political unrest , " he says			0
still , @entity31 does not see the spike in emigration as a mass exodus of millionaires			0
" it 's very normal that people would want to leave and see the outside world after they 've made a fortune , " he says			2
" the same thing has happened in @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			0
" @entity31 thinks it 's a good thing			2
" it 's globalization , " he says			2
" it facilitates exchange of business ideas and helps bridge cultural gaps			0
" even when they emigrate , experts say , most @entity2 elite keep one foot planted in @entity2			2
" they keep their businesses here , " says @entity143 , a former immigration specialist at the @entity145 in @entity36 , and now a top executive at @entity33			2
" these millionaires are familiar with @entity2 's unique culture , " says @entity143			1
" they have succeeded here , but success elsewhere is not guaranteed			0
" when weighed against the gains to be made in @entity2 today , not to mention the prevailing confusion in the @entity154 and @entity96 markets , most @entity2 prefer to keep significant part of their assets in @entity2 , " he says			1
" this is also where they are ' at home ' no matter their passport or residency			0
" some 40 % of the @entity2 millionaires polled by the @entity5 prefer to set up their " second home " in the @entity96 , followed by @entity37 , @entity165 and @entity154			1
" the @entity96 requires shorter time of stay in the country to gain permanent resident status and their other procedures are less complicated , " says @entity31			2
but the hurdles on the way into @entity96 are high , too , says @entity174			2
" an alien investor applicant must be able to demonstrate that the funds invested were obtained from a legitimate source , " she explains			0
an applicant may also be rejected if they are unable to demonstrate that their capital investment in the enterprise will create or preserve at least 10 jobs for qualified @entity96 workers within the @entity96 legal fees from immigration attorneys that prepare the applications are not cheap			2
" it can range from $ 15,000 to $ 25,000 , " says @entity174			0
but for the @entity2 millionaires , that 's small change .			1
