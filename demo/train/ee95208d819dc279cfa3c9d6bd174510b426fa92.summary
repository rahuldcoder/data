-- @entity1 is shutting down a business unit that it bought for over half - a - billion dollars : the @entity3			1
that 's a shame , considering how high the @entity5 was flying a few short years ago			1
it 's also a waste , considering that @entity1 bought @entity5 from @entity7 only two years ago for a cool $ 590 million			1
but @entity1 probably had to act fast , because its earnings fell 18 % in the second quarter of 2011 , and ceo @entity10 had to show he was doing something decisive to stanch the flow			1
it 's not like the @entity5 was doing that well of late			2
when was the last time you saw someone actually using one of these low - quality , " good - enough " flips ? probably about two years ago			1
just what murdered those cheap , adorable camcorders ? the obvious culprit is the general - purpose smartphone			1
when iphones and @entity25 phones began shipping with decent cameras for shooting stills , the @entity5 seemed excessive			1
when phones got hd video recording , the @entity5 was downright redundant			2
but the smartphone was n't the sole cause of the @entity5 's fate			0
the @entity5 would still be around if @entity1 had bothered at all to adapt to the market			1
after all , there are plenty of camera businesses like @entity36 that are still alive and well			0
here are a few reasons why the @entity5 flopped			0
smarter general - purpose devices let 's get the obvious reason out of the way first			1
when @entity43 introduced the camera - equipped @entity44 in 2009 , he made it clear that the @entity5 budget camcorder was @entity49 's primary target			1
" we want to get in on this , " said @entity43 regarding the budget - camera industry , while showing a slide of the @entity5 at the 2009 @entity44 event			2
why buy a cheap camcorder if you could buy an @entity44 that shot video , too ? in addition to the @entity59 , @entity49 had already released the @entity60 , also capable of capturing standard - definition video			0
eventually , a slew of @entity25 smartphones also shipped with video - capable cameras , and so did @entity49 's @entity65			2
the @entity66 and others brought hd video recording to smartphones , eliminating the @entity5 's last possible advantage			2
suddenly , the notion of carrying around a cheap camcorder in addition to a general - purpose smartphone or @entity44 seemed impractical -- extra bulk in your pocket			1
a slew of general - purpose devices made the @entity5 irrelevant			1
the shift to real - time social networking the @entity5 probably would n't have been murdered so easily if @entity1 had caught on to something that 's been trendy for years : real - time social networking			1
to make that work , the @entity5 would have required an internet connection			0
you 'd think that would be an easy addition , considering that @entity1 is a networking company			0
after @entity49 released the video - equipped @entity60 , @entity1 should 've quickly shipped a @entity88 -- enabled @entity5 for customers to immediately shoot and post media on social networking sites such as @entity92 and @entity93			1
instead , existing @entity5 camcorders require a wired connection to a pc in order to transfer the files and upload them to a website			2
that 's old - school , pc - centric social networking			0
these days , people like to share their media wherever they are , when it 's happening			0
because the @entity5 lacked a wireless connection to the internet , this was another reason to just buy a smartphone			0
here 's where the @entity5 had a chance to survive			0
kids love social networking and sharing pics and video , and they ca n't afford smartphone plans			0
an affordable , cheap camera with an internet connection would 've been pretty compelling			0
furthermore , @entity5 customers did n't particularly have anywhere they belonged to feel special			0
@entity1 could 've bolstered an internet - enabled @entity5 with a unique social network made just for @entity5 users			1
to be fair , evidence shows @entity1 was trying to ship a @entity88 -- enabled @entity5 , but it moved too slowly			1
at this point , smartphones are already too far ahead , with popular social media apps such as @entity126 and @entity127 making them even cooler			0
no compelling high - end option @entity1 's line of " high - end " @entity5 products are yawn - inducing			1
the high - end @entity131 ( $ 230 ) includes 16 gb of storage , 720p video and 2x video zoom			0
for the same price , a low - end @entity65 includes 8 gb of storage , 720p video , an internet connection and access to hundreds of thousands of apps in the @entity141			0
which would you choose ? if @entity1 had focused on optimizing the high end of its flip camera line , it would 've offered a compelling reason to buy a @entity5 versus a smartphone or @entity44			2
imagine a high - end @entity5 with a @entity88 or @entity150 internet connection , 1080p video , a decent zoom lens , and a touchscreen with apps made just for @entity5 video and photo			2
a solid , premium multimedia device would 've enabled @entity5 to stand out among the " jack - of - all - trades " multifunction devices out there			2
but alas , the @entity5 is dead			0
