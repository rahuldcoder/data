@entity0 -- some people lose their homes because they have lost their jobs			0
@entity5 , a federal air marshal , says he 's losing his job because he is losing his home			1
the @entity8 this month notified @entity5 , 43 , that it is firing him because his security clearance was revoked , a direct result of bank foreclosures on his home and two investment properties , and related debts			2
federal rules require employees with security clearances to remain solvent -- or to disclose their debts -- so they will be free from the " potential for coercion , " or bribes			0
aware of the rules , @entity5 notified his boss in the spring of 2008 of his financial problems brought on by the real estate collapse and a divorce , he said			1
he again disclosed his money woes several months later during a routine five - year review of his security clearance , listing the pending foreclosures and other debts			0
his boss vouched for him , telling investigators that @entity5 's disclosure of his money problems would prevent someone from blackmailing him , records show			2
@entity5 and his attorney say they believe the @entity8 is firing @entity5 not because of concerns about his finances , as stated in government documents , but because of lingering doubts or anger agency officials may have about accusations from a former girlfriend , who accused @entity5 of breaking into her home and of domestic violence			2
in february of 2009 , @entity5 , a supervisor in the air marshal 's @entity47 field office , went to his former girlfriend 's home to retrieve his possessions			1
he was accompanied by local sheriffs who he had requested to accompany him to serve as witnesses			0
the girlfriend accused him of unlawfully entering her home and violating an injunction for protection against domestic abuse			0
the injunction was later dismissed , a judge ruling that there was insufficient evidence against @entity5			0
subsequently , the @entity8 said the allegations were not a factor in the decision to revoke @entity5 's security clearance			1
" you provided documentation that mitigated the ( ex-girlfriend 's allegations ) to a level that does not adversely affect national security , " the @entity8 's @entity65 wrote			1
but financial concerns did merit the revocation of @entity5 's security clearance , the @entity8 wrote			1
" i really think that @entity5 's firing comes from a combination of things , and i do believe that a lot initially hinged on the domestic violence allegation that ultimately was n't proved truthful , " said @entity74 , @entity5 's attorney			0
" because that ( domestic violence ) has such a stigma on it , even if it was n't true , it put @entity5 in a negative light			0
and that has conveyed ever after			0
" @entity74 said the reason cited by the @entity8 for @entity5 's pending dismissal -- financial concerns -- are meritless , saying they were known by the @entity8 long ago , but were invoked only after the february 2009 allegations from his ex-girlfriend			1
@entity74 and @entity5 say they are particularly riled by the @entity8 's findings that @entity5 had failed to take actions to mitigate his debts , had taken on new debts , and had increased his mortgage delinquencies			1
the first two allegations are false , he said			0
@entity5 said he lost $ 172,000 of his own money on the three properties , spending $ 70,000 to $ 80,000 trying to save the two investment properties from foreclosure			0
he said " new delinquencies " cited by @entity8 had actually been disclosed in 2008 , and did not result in his dismissal at the time			1
as for the " increased in delinquencies " cited by the @entity8 , @entity5 said the increase is a direct result of his being placed on unpaid administrative leave			2
the @entity8 created a " @entity111 " scenario , attorney @entity74 said			1
as long as @entity5 remains suspended without pay , the @entity8 will be able to show that his delinquent mortgage payments are increasing , he wrote in court documents			2
" the agency has helped to create additional delinquencies that now form the basis for its continued revocation of ( @entity5 's ) security status , " @entity74 wrote			0
@entity5 apparently is n't the only air marshal whose financial problems threatened their jobs , records show			1
in march of 2009 , the @entity8 issued a policy statement saying that in consideration of the " current economic climate , " foreclosures and bankruptcies would not automatically disqualify individuals from working with the @entity8			2
indeed , @entity5 says he has records of seven other air marshals at the @entity47 field office who have had their homes foreclosed or have suffered short sales of homes , some after voluntarily taking transfers to or from other @entity8 offices			1
but @entity5 evidently is the only air marshal who lost his clearance , and is losing his job , because of financial concerns , he said			1
the @entity8 declined to discuss @entity5 's case , saying it does not comment on personnel matters			1
nor would it release information about the number of air marshals who lost their security clearance or jobs for financial reasons			0
@entity5 said he also believes the @entity8 pressed the case against him because of a confrontation he had with an @entity155 sheriff while removing furniture from his girlfriend 's house			2
according to a @entity8 incident report , @entity5 became " unprofessional " when told he could not remove any more furniture , twice sticking his hands out toward the deputies and stating " go ahead and arrest me , take me to jail ! " @entity5 acknowledges that he confronted the sheriff and made the statement , but denied being unprofessional , saying he was " challenging the position he was taking with regards to the statute or the law			0
" @entity5 says he is appealing his firing , and his attorney said they are contemplating a lawsuit .			0

disclosed his problems to @entity8 as required
lawyer says @entity8 has created " @entity111 "
