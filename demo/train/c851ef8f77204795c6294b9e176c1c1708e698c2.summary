-- @entity2 opposition leader @entity1 is expected to meet tuesday with @entity4 @entity3 ban ki - moon , a day after she said she would take the oath of office for the country 's parliament after initially resisting it			1
the impasse over the oath had been preventing her and other newly elected members of her party from taking their seats in the legislature			1
" i will go to the parliament because there is a demand of people who voted for me , " @entity1 said after meeting with party members in @entity17 on monday			1
she and 42 other members of her party , the @entity22 , were elected in by - elections earlier this month			1
they had been delaying their debuts in parliament because they objected to the wording of the oath they would have to take			1
the @entity22 had asked the authorities to amend the oath to say that members will " abide by " the constitution rather than " protect " it			2
party members want to revise the constitution , which they view as undemocratic			2
but the government of president @entity38 , a former military official , did n't appear to show any sign of moving to accommodate the request			0
@entity1 , who spent years under house arrest , said monday that she would " take an oath for the country and for the people			1
" she added that she had been urged to enter parliament by some parliament members and representatives of @entity2 's ethnic minority groups			0
asked whether she was concerned she may appear weak by backing down over the oath , @entity1 said , " i do n't care			1
" @entity50 , a spokesman for the @entity22 , said @entity1 will attend parliament in the capital , @entity53 , on wednesday for " just one day			1
" the breakthrough came while the @entity4 chief @entity55 was in @entity2			0
he met with top officials , including @entity38 , on monday and offered @entity4 support			0
he is scheduled to meet tuesday with @entity1			1
the international organization is available to provide technical assistance for @entity2 's first census in 2014 and lend its electoral expertise in the run - up to the 2015 elections , the @entity4 said			0
@entity55 is the latest in a string of high - profile officials to visit the country as it emerges from decades of international isolation			0
@entity2 's authoritarian military rulers are loosening their grip on power after decades of stifling dissent and limiting freedoms			0
in the past 12 months , the government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners , secured a cease - fire with @entity77 rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups			0
the success of @entity1 and her party at the by - elections this month was welcomed by the @entity82 and @entity83 as a sign of progress toward democracy			1
the dispute over the wording of the oath appeared to create an early stumbling block in that process			1
but @entity1 said last week that she did not want the issue to become " political , " insisting that it was a " technical " problem			2
her arrival in parliament on wednesday will illustrate the pace at which @entity2 is changing : she was released from house arrest less than a year and a half ago			0
control of parliament will not change despite the opposition 's strong performance , but the entry of the @entity22 members will nonetheless give the party a notable presence			2
@entity2 's legislature has 664 seats , more than 80 % of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military - backed ruling group , the @entity108			2
many @entity110 governments have taken steps to ease sanctions on @entity2 , also known as @entity2 , in response to its political reforms			0
but international officials have also cautioned that the country still has a long way to go			0
speaking last week ahead of his trip , the @entity4 ' @entity55 said that @entity2 's " fresh start is still fragile			0

@entity1 and her party object to wording of the swearing - in oath in parliament
they had been delaying their debuts in the legislature
@entity1 now says she will go to parliament and take the oath
she is scheduled to meet with @entity133 on tuesday
