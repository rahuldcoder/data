-- there 's nothing like images of infants and children in distress to make outsiders yearn to help , which is why the unfolding story of @entity11 's orphans -- the most helpless of earthquake victims -- has kept people riveted			1
but what can be done and what should be the focus of attention and efforts remains a mystery to many @entity20 , who are flooding the phone lines of organizations , seeking to adopt these children -- immediately			1
the offer to open arms , hearts and homes is no doubt well - intentioned , but several leading aid organizations recently said new adoptions should stop and not be rushed			1
they want to protect children wrongly identified as orphans from being moved out of the country or falling victim to child traffickers			2
to help people understand what is and what can be , here are the facts as they stand right now : understanding the numbers in 2007 , the @entity42 , or @entity42 , estimated that there were 380,000 orphans in @entity11			1
but -- emphasis on " but " -- that number is rough at best , said @entity47 , a @entity42 spokesman			0
the oversight of children in the system has been lousy in @entity11 , de @entity51 said , and parents -- burdened by hardships -- have been known to leave their children in orphanages on a temporary basis			1
so determining who was truly orphaned before the earthquake was next to impossible			0
despite the large number of orphans , as of last summer , @entity11 had only about 100 licensed orphanages and 67 cr√®ches ( orphanages licensed to perform adoptions ) , according to the @entity66 , or @entity67			1
orphanages generally have no more than 150 children , according to adoption officials in the @entity20			1
this means most kids described as orphans in @entity11 have not been housed in licensed establishments			1
add to this the recent chaos and inevitable loss of documentation , and nailing down an accurate number of orphans becomes even more difficult			0
since the 7.0 earthquake struck two weeks ago , 497 @entity11 orphans have been evacuated to the @entity20 , according to tuesday 's figure from a @entity85 official			1
these were children confirmed to be orphans and already far along in the adoption process with identified families waiting for them			1
in total , 500 orphans had been issued travel documents to go to the @entity20 , said @entity93 , executive director of the @entity94 , a @entity95 - based nonprofit organization that works to raise awareness about children worldwide in need of homes			1
@entity93 estimates more than 900 orphans -- including more than 400 who do n't yet have travel documents -- were in the process of being adopted from @entity11 and placed in @entity20 homes			1
the actual match between family and child , she says , happens early in the two - to three - year adoption process , which is why this limbo stage is so painful for families who cling to photos of a child they 've already grown to love			0
should doors open to more children ? late last week , three aid groups -- @entity118 , @entity119 and a unit of the @entity122 @entity121 -- issued a joint statement , asking for an immediate halt to any new adoptions of @entity11 children			1
the crux of their argument was that hasty adoptions could break up families that may still have a chance of coming together again			1
rather than whisk these children off to a foreign land , which might create a new set of problems for already traumatized young ones , these organizations , as well as many advocates in the adoption field , said the children should be cared for where they are -- provided with food , shelter , clothing and medical care -- and given the chance to reunite with family members who may be frantically searching for them			0
it 's better to give to the organizations that are on the ground , looking out for the welfare of kids , they say			0
@entity42 released a statement last week echoing this stance and saying that efforts to register unaccompanied children are under way			0
" every effort will be made to reunite children with their families			2
only if that proves impossible , and after proper screening has been carried out , should permanent alternatives like adoption be considered by the relevant authorities , " said @entity162 , @entity42 's executive director			0
" screening for international adoption for some @entity11 children had been completed prior to the earthquake			2
where this is the case , there are clear benefits to speeding up their travel to their new homes			0
" added to the concern for these children are fears of increased trafficking and sexual exploitation			0
before the earthquake , @entity42 estimated that as many as 2,000 @entity11 children were being trafficked annually to the @entity184 , which shares the island of @entity186 with @entity11 , often with the consent of parents			2
these worries , and the desire to rejoin children with their loving family members , are not lost on @entity20 lawmakers who came out tuesday in support of a more efficient adoption process for @entity11			1
no one wants to tear children from the waiting arms of family members , nor do they want to place kids in danger			0
but for those who are " true orphans , " sen. @entity202 , @entity203 , and other senators from both parties , are throwing their political weight behind the issue			0
they say it 's time to cut through the red tape that slows down the adoption process and drags it on for years -- for the sake of verified orphans living in @entity11 , but also for those who span the globe and will still need loving homes after the media coverage surrounding @entity11 's earthquake dies down			2
these lawmakers are pushing this week to get the families for @entity221 out of a @entity223 committee and onto the floor for a vote			2
the bill would create an office in the @entity85 to specifically handle adoption issues and look out for the best interests of the world 's most vulnerable children			2
the stance of the @entity11 authorities , though , appears unbending			0
" the @entity11 government is very clear on this , " said @entity234 , the communications minister			0
" we are facilitating all of the adoption applications already submitted			0
other than those , no child will be leaving the country for adoption			0

images of @entity11 infants and children in distress keep world watching and worried
calls from families hoping to adopt @entity11 orphans flood phone lines
aid agencies explain why hasty adoptions are dangerous and offer advice on how to help
@entity20 lawmakers step in , trying to make adoptions more efficient
