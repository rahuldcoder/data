editor 's note : @entity2 is senior legal counsel for the @entity3 , a nonprofit organization of @entity5 attorneys			2
he has litigated religious liberty and free speech cases since 1984 , including the @entity9 case before the @entity11 @entity10 in 1999 , involving mandatory student fees at public universities , and a 2004 case that resulted in a @entity16 @entity10 ruling that marriage licenses issued by @entity18 to same - sex couples were invalid			2
@entity2 says @entity21 's views on marriage should n't bar him from @entity24 's inauguration			1
@entity25 , @entity26 ( @entity27 ) -- proponents of redefining marriage could n't wait for the new president to be sworn in before demanding that he erase from the inauguration ceremony a prominent @entity11 who disagrees with them			2
the target of their rhetorical bombardment is @entity21 , the popular @entity5 pastor from @entity16			0
president - elect @entity24 has asked @entity21 to give the invocation at his inauguration			1
not so fast , cries @entity37 , head of @entity38 , an organization that claims to advance equality and freedom of speech and religion ( but not for @entity21 and those who agree with his marriage views ) in a piece published on @entity27			2
@entity21 's grave sin ? along with 52 percent of @entity16 voters , he supported @entity16 's @entity47 , which affirmed the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman			1
what a radical ! though @entity21 will only be praying for the country 's future ( not giving a speech about marriage ) , @entity37 and others are pressuring @entity24 to set a precedent for his administration of publicly shunning someone who supports the traditional definition of marriage			1
they want people like @entity21 silenced and ostracized for their " hate speech , " defined today as disagreeing with their agenda to impose a redefinition of marriage on an unwilling @entity11			1
@entity24 , to his credit , has resisted their strident demands			0
the attacks on @entity21 are the latest in a series of coercive , intimidating attacks on supporters of traditional marriage			0
now , activists have ramped up their strong - arm tactics by pushing the president - elect to ban @entity21 from appearing at the inauguration			1
this is amazingly audacious , in light of the fact that on marriage , the overwhelming majority of @entity11 and , indeed , humanity , agrees with @entity21			1
@entity11 have voted to preserve marriage in all 30 states where it has been on the ballot by an average vote of more than 65 percent			0
the collective experience and wisdom of every major civilization from the dawn of time agrees that societies function best and children are best protected when marriage is defined as between one man and one woman			0
@entity21 and those who agree with him want all nations to experience these benefits of marriage when it is rightly defined and consistently practiced			0
ironically , @entity24 has repeatedly stated that he agrees " that marriage is the union between a man and a woman			1
" does @entity37 question his fitness to serve as president in light of his allegedly " bigoted " views on marriage ? @entity37 brazenly denies that she and other activists desire to silence pastors like @entity21 because of their marriage views			2
she is indignant that @entity21 and others spread the " big lie " that redefining marriage would threaten the freedom of speech and religious liberties of those who hold the view shared by the vast majority of @entity11			1
her argument is disarming in its pure duplicity			0
part of @entity37 's case against @entity21 , who she thinks should not be speaking at such an important public ceremony , is that he believes that folks like her are working to ban people like him from speaking at public ceremonies			1
thus , the " big lie " becomes an obvious truth			0
this is really all about ideological purity -- and purging			0
are the activists proposing that no one should be permitted to speak at the inauguration if they hold beliefs on marriage contrary to hers and her ideological bedfellows ? how can publicly snubbing the influential and respected @entity21 advance what @entity37 calls " the values of unity and respect ... on which president - elect @entity24 campaigned ? " it wo n't			1
but it will surely send a message to those who believe in marriage , that they will be viciously attacked for expressing , or merely believing , that marriage is defined as between one man and one woman			0
ms. @entity37 provides just the latest example of how the forces of " tolerance " and " diversity " quickly abandon their principles of " live and let live " when somebody disagrees with them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity24 has asked @entity21 to give the invocation
he says activists are seeking to ban @entity21 from speaking because of his views
@entity2 says @entity21 's view on marriage is the majority position in the @entity11
