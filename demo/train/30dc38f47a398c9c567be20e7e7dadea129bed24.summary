@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 completed voting wednesday in a landmark election that one outside observer said was free of any violations , the state - run news agency @entity3 said			1

in the 17th time @entity0 has gone to the polls to elect a parliament since becoming a nation in 1946 , wednesday 's balloting was an election of firsts			1
for the first time , the country has allowed observers			0
it was the first time that an independent election commission oversaw polling			0
" these elections today are the culmination of a constitutional process , the beginning of a new phase of reforms			2
it is a continuing process , " said @entity0 foreign minister @entity46			1
on wednesday , prime minister @entity48 said he had not yet submitted his resignation to @entity50 until elections are completed , @entity3 reported			1
jordanians who are part of the @entity54 were said to be boycotting the election -- an action @entity48 described as not democratic , @entity3 said			0
voting is a duty , he said			2
if voter turnout is deemed weak , @entity48 said , it will be mainly due to people 's frustrations with the performance of former parliaments and the suspicion that surrounded previous polls			2
still , @entity0 could be a model for the @entity70 world in holding free and fair elections , @entity48 said			1
" fair elections can not only be ensured by the government and its agencies but also by candidates , voters and civil society institutions , " @entity48 said , adding that the government and the @entity15 did their utmost to fight any electoral corruption			1
the king has stated in discussion papers that the new prime minister will be designated based on consultations with the parliamentary bloc that has the majority , @entity48 said			0
the deliberate steps at transparency are crucial for a country that 's under a great deal of political strain -- and whose stability has ramifications for the world outside its borders			0
recent events have threatened the fragile monarchy to the point that some analysts are warning of collapse			0
what began with protests by the @entity104 , @entity0 's branch of the @entity54 , has given way to broader unrest led by tribal factions known as @entity108 ( the movement )			1
@entity108 demands an end to corruption and calls for a new era of political reform in @entity0 in which islamists are almost sure to dominate			1
in an effort to quell the protests , @entity0 's ruler , @entity50 , dissolved parliament last year and amended election laws			1
in a region rocked by @entity121 upheavals , @entity0 has been relatively stable and is one of the few friends @entity123 has			1
it is amid this backdrop that most @entity0 went to the polls			1
" elections have been fairly smooth so far , " said @entity16 , chief observer of the @entity129			0
some polling stations reported minor technical glitches , but there had been no " signs of intimidation , " he said			0
security and observers wednesday 's balloting took place under the watchful eye of 47,000 police officers and another 7,000 election observers			0
" opening the door to observers -- international , @entity70 and local -- is proof that we trust ourselves and that there 's nothing to hide , " said @entity143 , a government spokesman			0
" the @entity0 parliamentary elections are under the scrutiny of the entire world			1
and we 're in the time of the @entity121 and nobody 's afraid to say anything			0
" @entity46 , speaking wednesday to @entity2 , said his country had " anticipated the @entity121 , " so the king began reforms " many years ago			2
" but he acknowledged that protests in the region expedited the changes inside @entity0			1
more than 3 million @entity0 were eligible to vote for candidates to the new 150 - member @entity164 , officials said			1
a field of more than 1,400 candidates vied for the seats			0
" nothing undermines the legitimacy of any election except the lack of participation by the electorate , by the people who are eligible to vote , " @entity46 said			0
@entity54 opts out the reforms made by the @entity0 government were not enough to satisfy the @entity54 , which felt the new electoral laws favored the monarchy			1
despite their rejection , the government continued to encourage them to take part in the process			0
" we told the @entity54 members who are boycotting that we invite you to exercise the same logic that your brothers in @entity191 with the @entity192 exercised when there was a dispute over the constitution and not the law , " @entity143 said			0
" they invited @entity191 to the ballot box			0
so we invite you to the ballot box here			0
" in a discussion paper posted on @entity0 's @entity203 website , @entity50 said the country is transitioning to a parliamentary government and has " enhanced the separation of powers , the checks and balances of our governance system , the independence of our judiciary and the inalienable rights of our citizens			1
" @entity0 has amended one - third of the constitution and established a constitutional court , the king said			2
" these actions empower the @entity0 people to shape the country 's future in a way that is more transparent , fair and inclusive than ever before , " @entity50 wrote			1
" crafting a modern democratic society will be the product of our learning and developing together over time , not a single moment or set of reforms			2
" time for a change the @entity229 has said it supports both the king 's road map for reform -- which gradually shifts more power to the elected parliament -- and demands for a more inclusive political process			2
but the two may not be compatible			0
the tribes do n't want to see the largely urban @entity54 -- which derives much of its support from @entity0 's @entity241 population , which makes up about half the country -- gain power at their expense			2
pinched by an economic crisis that has left the government virtually bankrupt and unrest in neighboring countries , @entity50 faces a challenge that may not be satisfied by all the firsts represented in this election			2
