@entity0 , the man allegedly behind the inflammatory film " @entity1 , " was ordered held without bail thursday after being arrested in @entity3 and accused of violating his probation			1
" he engaged in a likely pattern of deception both to his probation officers and the court , " judge @entity6 said in issuing her ruling			1
the preliminary bail hearing began with @entity6 asking the defendant -- dressed in gray slacks and a white and yellow striped t - shirt , with handcuffs and chain around his waist -- what his true name was			0
" @entity23 , " he replied			0
the judge then asked again , what is your name ? " @entity23 , " he said this time , again without spelling the name out			0
he has used at least 17 false names , according to court documents , but is mostly referred to as @entity0			2
an attorney for the man then argued for $ 10,000 bail			1
attorney @entity34 said his client had always maintained contact , in person and by telephone , with probation officers who have been monitoring him since his 2010 bank fraud conviction			1
but the main reason @entity0 should n't be jailed , his lawyer argued , was for safety reasons , saying the anti-islam film would make him a target of fellow inmates			1
" it is a danger for him to remain in custody at the @entity49 in @entity50 because there are a large number of @entity53 in there , " @entity34 said			0
" we are extremely concerned about his safety			0
" making no mention of aliases , the lawyer added that @entity0 had made no attempt to flee @entity3 and never would			2
assistant u.s. attorney @entity61 told the judge that the man -- whom he referred to as @entity0 or @entity64 -- had engaged in a " pattern of deception " and " a person who can not be trusted			1
" @entity61 pointed to a probation report citing eight allegations in which @entity0 had allegedly violated his probation			1
one of those was a requirement not to use aliases without permission from his probation officer , something the prosecutor said @entity0 did on at least three instances : during his fraud case , when he tried to get a passport in 2011 and during the making of the film			1
@entity61 said @entity0 had deceived the cast of the film as well as his probation officers			1
the prosecutor also noted that @entity0 was able to afford to make payments during the making of the film , saying it further raised concerns about the possibility of him fleeing the area while the legal case against him proceeds			1
" he poses a flight risk and poses a danger to others , " @entity61 said , alluding to the probation report 's recommendation that @entity0 be sentenced to 24 months in prison			1
the prosecutor added that he had received assurances from the @entity49 that @entity0 would be placed in protective custody if he was ordered jailed , meaning he would not have contact with other inmates			1
the judge , who ordered a future identity hearing to determine the defendant 's actual name , cited the many instances in which he misrepresented his name			2
she also noted his " unstable " residence and work history , referring to the film project , as also among the reasons for denying him bail			2
when asked if he understood the nature of the hearing , @entity0 answered , " yes			2
" the judge then waived his right to a preliminary hearing and left open a future date for a revocation hearing			0
immediately following thursday 's hearing , @entity0 was escorted away by the @entity124 in a three - car caravan and driven two blocks to the @entity49			1
' @entity1 ' actress sues filmmaker , @entity129 earlier this month , @entity0 met with a probation officer in the wake of a federal review of his five - year supervised probation in the 2010 case			1
@entity0 was cooperative at that voluntary interview , authorities said			2
he was bundled up in a coat , hat and white scarf when he was escorted from his house for that interview			0
he was n't under arrest at that time			0
having served one year in federal prison at @entity144 , @entity3 , officials could n't determine this month whether @entity0 paid any of the court - ordered restitution of $ 794,700 , according to probation department officials and court records			1
while on probation , @entity0 was prohibited from using aliases as well as accessing computers or any device that can access the internet without approval from his probation officer			1
@entity156 blocks @entity129 , @entity157 over @entity159 video he came to the world 's attention after his movie , a trailer of which had been posted to @entity129 , was highlighted this month by media in @entity166			0
violent protests subsequently erupted in @entity166 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity156 , @entity172 , @entity173 and the @entity175 territories , with some of them targeting @entity178 diplomatic missions			0
on friday , a @entity180 court ruled the film to be extremist and banned it in the @entity183 republic , according to information minister @entity184			0
the film has potential to inflame sectarian hatred and may cause " destabilization of the political situation in the region , most of whose population is @entity53 , " he said			0
as the protests raged , @entity0 remained out of public view and ensconced with his family in their home in @entity198 , @entity3 , southeast of downtown @entity50			2
actor : anti-islam filmmaker ' was playing us along ' when news of his movie first broke , the filmmaker identified himself as @entity0 and told @entity205 he was a 52 - year - old @entity173 - @entity178 real estate developer from @entity3			2
he said @entity207 donors had financed his film			0
but @entity173 's @entity209 said there was no record of a @entity0 with @entity173 citizenship			2
a production staff member who worked on the film in its initial stages told @entity216 that a different name was filed on the paperwork for the @entity219 : @entity220			0
