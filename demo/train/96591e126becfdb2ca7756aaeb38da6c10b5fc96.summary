@entity1 have what appears at first to be the perfect modern relationship			1
the two have known each other since the 10th grade , but never take each other for granted			0
they 're warm , responsive , and fun - loving , with lots of shared rituals and cutesy little private games			2
out to dinner with their best friends ( @entity17 and @entity18 ) , they talk about what they 're going to order by lapsing into showbiz @entity22 accents ( clearly a favorite routine of theirs ) , which allows them to tweak each other 's foibles -- like who 's going to do more mooching off the other 's plate -- while keeping the interaction light			2
these two are so funny and affectionate , so made for each other , they 're not just friends or lovers			0
they seem more like newlyweds			0
and by the way ... they 're getting divorced			0
huh ? " @entity48 " throws us that curveball early on , and it establishes the movie as a romantic comedy powered by a question as novel and provocative as the one that drove " when @entity47 " : can a man and woman be friends ? the question here is more along the lines of : can a man and woman who were more than friends realize they still might be ? so why are @entity1 and @entity2 splitting up ? we hear the rationale in bits and pieces , and it does n't sound all that major -- mostly issues of unequal careers			1
she 's a celebrity trend - spotter , he 's a gifted graphic artist who 's doing ... not much			1
he 's a passive underachiever			2
@entity68 defends @entity70 coverage initially , i fought the film 's premise			2
i thought : could n't @entity2 try a bit harder ? could n't the two get some couples therapy ? that , however , is all part of the movie 's design			2
even when @entity1 and @entity2 start dating other people , they are still hooked on each other -- and maybe that 's what they need to let go of			1
we 're not quite certain , since @entity3 and @entity0 forge a connection so rich in chemistry and personal nuance			1
@entity3 , taking on his first role that 's more dramatic than comedic , is intensely compelling ; he uses his big , wide , open features to play @entity2 as a dude bristling with an ironic cleverness that ca n't mask his feelings			1
and @entity0 , who was so winning in " @entity93 , " makes @entity1 a study in engagingly high - functional yuppie self - delusion			1
she wants to control everything , including her romantic impulses			0
only that 's not how it works			0
' @entity101 ' photos : it 's @entity104 and @entity105 ! " @entity48 " bounces along with nimble invention , from a photo montage that colors in an entire romantic history to the hilarious scene in which @entity1 , increasingly jealous , gets caught going through @entity2 's garbage can			1
i wo n't even hint at what happens , since the movie keeps taking us , like its characters , by surprise			0
i will say that it 's been a while since a romantic comedy mustered this much charm by looking this much like life			0
