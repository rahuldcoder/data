-- @entity1 shrugged off the @entity3 controversy to stay in contention for the @entity6 lead with a 4 - 0 rout of struggling @entity8 on saturday			1
@entity10 's men remained level on points with leaders @entity13 , who struggled to a 2 - 0 win over promoted @entity17 , but the victory was tempered by an injury to @entity20			1
the striker has made a huge impact since being signed to replace @entity3 in pre-season , scoring eight league goals , but he went off with a groin problem in the first half			2
with his fellow @entity27 suspended after refusing to come on as a substitute in the midweek @entity30 defeat at @entity31 , @entity20 started the match alongside the recalled @entity33			2
is @entity3 ' strike ' sad for soccer ? the @entity36 , who missed the trip to @entity39 , was given the nod ahead of @entity41 -- another eight - goal man this season , but another @entity1 player in trouble after having to apologize to @entity10 following his angry reaction when he was substituted in @entity47			1
after a scoreless first half , @entity33 hit the post before young @entity51 winger @entity50 broke the deadlock with a superb curled effort in the 56th minute			0
@entity33 made it 2 - 0 three minutes later , then @entity20 's replacement @entity57 settled it with 17 minutes to play on the counter-attack as home fans called for @entity8 manager @entity61 to be sacked			1
@entity63 defender @entity62 headed in @entity57 's late corner to score the 20 - year - old 's first goal for @entity1 and leave @entity8 second from bottom with four points from seven games			1
rivals @entity13 also moved onto 19 points after a victory at home to 10th - placed @entity17 that manager @entity75 described as " gritty			1
" the visitors missed several chances , and @entity13 made them pay as midfielder @entity78 scored with a rare header in the 68th minute and young substitute @entity80 added another with three minutes to play			2
" our home record has been fantastic for two seasons now , " said @entity75 , who made seven changes after @entity13 's 3 - 3 midweek draw with @entity84 in the @entity30			2
" this was not a good performance but we were gritty and we never gave in			0
that is a fantastic quality to have			0
" striker @entity91 returned from injury , hitting the bar late on , and should be fit for @entity51 's @entity95 qualifier in @entity63 on friday along with winger @entity96 -- who missed the match with an ankle injury			0
with @entity100 traveling to @entity101 on sunday , @entity99 took the chance to claim third place after a contentious 2 - 1 victory at @entity105			1
striker @entity106 followed up last weekend 's hat - trick with a 17th - minute header from a corner , and @entity110 doubled the lead before halftime			0
wolves were denied a penalty when referee @entity115 wrongly ruled that @entity116 was fouled outside the area , then @entity118 pulled a goal back in the 88th minute			0
@entity121 's team were again denied when @entity123 's header was controversially ruled out by the assistant official , who said the ball had already gone out of play			0
fifth - placed @entity127 joined @entity100 on 13 points with a 2 - 0 victory in the @entity131 derby that left @entity133 manager @entity132 fuming			1
young midfielder @entity134 was sent off midway through the first half for a sliding challenge on @entity137 , despite clearly making contact with the ball before sending the @entity141 striker tumbling			0
" the sending - off ruined the game			0
you get lots of questions from people asking about derbies , tackles and sendings - off but that was n't even a bad tackle , " @entity132 said after ref @entity144 handed out his 15th red card since the start of last season			0
@entity137 won a penalty before halftime , but @entity160 's attempt was saved by @entity161			0
striker @entity162 put @entity127 ahead in the 71st minute from @entity164 's cross after @entity160 ducked out of the way , with the club - record $ 50 million signing scoring his first league goal this season			1
@entity137 sealed it with eight to play with his fourth league goal this season , leaving unhappy @entity133 in 11th place			2
unbeaten @entity172 moved up to sixth with a 2 - 0 victory that condemned @entity174 to a fifth successive defeat in all competitions			1
@entity177 scored the first - half opener and set up fellow striker @entity179 for the second after the break			2
@entity182 came from two goals down to secure a 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity186 , who scored within five minutes through @entity188 and @entity189			1
new @entity191 striker @entity190 scored his first for the club since leaving @entity193 with a deflected shot in the 24th minute , and @entity196 winger @entity195 did the same when he leveled two minutes later with a header .			0

@entity1 level with leaders @entity13 after 4 - 0 win at @entity8
big - money signing @entity20 injured before @entity1 score four second - half goals
@entity13 win 2 - 0 at home to @entity17 to stay ahead on goal *difference*
