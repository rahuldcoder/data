-- the question is not just whether @entity3 , in death , will ever be allowed to rest in peace			1
the question is whether he ever managed to find true peace while he was alive			2
@entity3 , the @entity7 from rural @entity8 who in the early years of the 20th century became the greatest athlete in the world , died in 1953			1
he is back in the news because one of his sons , @entity15 , 73 , is waging a legal battle to have his body removed from where it is buried in @entity19 and sent back to @entity8			1
" i want to see him put away properly , " the son recently told reporter @entity21 of the @entity22			1
" i want him put where he wanted to be			2
" @entity3 is buried in the town of @entity3 , @entity19 , and the way that happened is a story in itself			1
@entity3 , the son of a @entity28 and @entity29 blacksmith in @entity8 , grew up with athletic ability so incandescent that the scope of his accomplishments mesmerized the world			1
he won two gold medals in the @entity35 , for the decathlon and the pentathlon			2
he was a professional football star and is a member of the @entity39			1
he played baseball in the major leagues for six seasons			1
his heart was broken after newspapers reported that , before going to the @entity45 , he had received small amounts of money for playing semi-pro baseball			1
today , of course , the idea of professional athletes competing in the @entity45 does n't even warrant a public yawn ; think of all the @entity54 players on the @entity56 @entity45 basketball team , or all the @entity58 players on various @entity45 hockey teams			1
but back then there was an assumed purity to the idea of amateurism , and @entity3 was shamed by having his @entity45 medals taken from him and his achievements nullified			1
( the medals were reinstated in 1983 , 30 years too late for him to know about it			2
) his post-sports life was rugged			1
beset by alcoholism , he died in a @entity71 trailer home at age 64 in 1953			2
various communities around the country offered to provide burial and a monument , in the hopes of attracting tourists			2
the @entity19 towns of @entity80 and @entity81 made the most attractive offer to @entity3 's third wife , @entity83 : if they could have the body of the world 's greatest athlete , they would rename their towns			1
so it is that @entity3 , for more than half a century , has been buried in @entity3			1
he had eight children ; i got to know one of them , his daughter @entity93 , when she was 70			2
she has since died , but some of the things she told me about her late dad have stayed with me , because they show a decent man who seemed lost in a lifetime blizzard of great fame and utter confusion			2
" when @entity104 was too old to play sports anymore , he had to make a living , " she said			2
" he had no money			0
there were no pension benefits or anything			0
he did n't know quite what to do			0
when he was in his 40s , he took a job out in @entity71 digging ditches			0
he did n't say much about that to me			0
he dug ditches because he had to make a buck			0
" once hailed by kings and presidents for his athletic skills , @entity3 's life , she said , became an almost constant struggle			1
she sensed his quiet sorrow about his medals being taken from him : " i think he was bitter , but i do n't really know , because he did n't talk much about himself , good or bad			0
" his losing battle with alcohol haunted her			0
" he was always so graceful , " she said			0
" when i was very young i did n't understand what a great athlete he was , but i knew what a graceful person he was			1
he taught me how to ballroom dance			0
he took me in his arms and taught me how to dance			0
" later in his life , she said , " sometimes he would come home after he had been drinking , and he would n't be physically graceful			1
he would slur his words and he would walk unsteadily , and it was a sad thing for me to see			0
" whether @entity3 's body will be taken out of its @entity19 resting place and shipped to @entity8 is something the courts will decide			1
it is one more melancholy act in a once - glorious life that was blindsided by the fates			1
@entity152 told me about a fleeting moment on one of the last days she ever spent with her dad			0
she was living in the small town of @entity157 , @entity158 , near the @entity160 line , and in 1951 he came to visit her			2
" @entity104 stayed with me , and he had to go to @entity158 for something , and i drove him to the bus stop , " she said			0
" in @entity157 , the bus stop was right underneath the marquee of the movie theater			0
" years before , when he needed money , @entity104 had sold the rights to make a movie of his life to @entity171			2
he had only been paid $ 1,500 for it			0
in 1951 @entity104 was 63 years old , and the movie had finally been made and had just come out			0
it starred @entity175 , playing my dad			0
and it was showing at the @entity179 that day			0
" so @entity104 was standing underneath the marquee , and the marquee had the title on it : ' @entity3 , @entity184			1
' i dropped him at the bus stop , and i looked back , and there he was			0
@entity104 was wearing his old suede jacket and a broad - brimmed hat , and he was carrying the same old suitcase he always carried			0
he was standing there kind of quiet , just waiting for the bus			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1

@entity3 was an @entity45 medallist , a @entity39 football player and a baseball player
@entity194 says the life of the " world 's greatest athlete " was *difficult*
he says towns vied to host his grave and the winner *changed* the name of the town to honor @entity3
now @entity3 's son is seeking to return his remains to @entity8
