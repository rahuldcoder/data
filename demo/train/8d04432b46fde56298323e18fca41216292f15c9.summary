editor 's note : actress and producer @entity2 played @entity4 in the films " @entity6 " and " @entity7 " and is a celebrity spokesperson for the advocacy organization @entity9			1
@entity2 says she struggled to come to terms with her son @entity13 's autism			1
( @entity14 ) -- when anything is wrong with your child , your first instinct is to make it better			1
diagnose the situation , find the answer to the problem and take your child 's pain away			1
but with autism , that takes quite a lot of doing			1
right after our son @entity13 celebrated his second birthday , he started to have increasingly lengthy and violent tantrums , usually initiated by his extraordinary sensitivity to sound			1
at the slightest provocation -- telephone ring , doorbell , a blow dryer , blender -- he would begin to scream , hold his ears and throw himself down on the ground			1
we went right to our pediatrician , who was not alarmed , gave him a routine hearing test , and basically said , " he 's 2 , you 've heard of the " terrible 2s			1
" this was 1994 , and the classic signs of autism were not as publicized , and therefore as recognizable , as they are today			1
then , a few months later , @entity13 began to wake up screaming two or three times a night			1
it would go on for hours , and there was nothing my husband or i could do			1
since @entity13 was so sensitive to sound , he began to stop responding to us as a way of protecting himself from the pain			1
feeling helpless and exhausted , we brought him to dr. @entity59 , the head of pediatric neurology at the @entity62			1
the diagnosis was @entity64 : @entity65			2
we learned that " autism " is an umbrella term for five spectrum disorders			1
after three more visits with @entity70 , @entity13 was diagnosed as a high - functioning child on the autistic spectrum , and she recommended we take him to @entity73 at the @entity74 on the @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77			2
the school was run by @entity80 's colleague , dr. @entity79			1
when a child is out of control , he or she needs you , the parent , to make them feel safe			2
so we were taught to sit behind @entity13 and hold him close with legs and arms wrapped around him , to become his backbone until the tantrum ran its course			2
when a child throws a tantrum , he throws himself on @entity94			2
i wanted @entity13 to throw himself on me and let me take care of him			2
but it was not to play out that way			2
i would n't believe there was something " wrong " with my son			1
can you imagine waking up two three times a night , every night , with your child for 12 years ? i knew i had to change myself , become somehow bigger , larger , stronger , able to envelop him , subdue him , keep him safe ; but , instead i went in the opposite direction			2
the shock of his diagnosis found me shrinking , hiding , disappearing , guilty and overprotective			1
i would not take any jobs			2
i would never leave him alone			2
what if he set the house on fire ? i took @entity13 to try every therapy known at the time : excising sugar , wheat or gluten from his diet , acupuncture , massage , psychic healers , trips to @entity126 , @entity127 , to @entity128 for auditory integration			2
i was told to see what interested him and develop those interests as a way in			2
for a few years , he obsessively loved daisies ; so we planted daisies everywhere			2
later , his most obsessive interest became pets , especially dogs			0
now it seems like we 've been to every pet store in every state and country and we have a bird , two cats , two dogs , five fish and a tortoise			0
i learned that early intervention with the appropriate therapy and a supportive family and a loving community will help your child reach his or her potential -- and that is the most important thing			0
we all want our children to be the best they can be ; and one of the blessings of having an autistic child is that you notice every little achievement , and it becomes cause for celebration			0
in our case , there was yet another special reward from having an autistic child			0
five years ago , i was approached by a television executive to develop an animated musical series for children			0
we have recently finished the pilot for @entity169 , and it centers around a little girl of that name who loves pets of all kinds and lives in a house full of them ( her father is a vet )			1
of course , the prime inspiration for her character and adventures was and is @entity13			0
not only that , among @entity169 's neighborhood friends is the first autistic child in a fictional series of this kind			1
one day , as i was speaking to another mother of a disabled child , i said our secret weapon against this disease is to do all we can without any expectation of results			0
mums the word ! @entity196 : mothers unite for miracles ! and i do have so many miracles to report and so many miracle workers who made them happen			0
they include his relatives , doctors , therapists and teachers			0
this includes his @entity209 teacher , @entity208			0
for two years , she prepared @entity13 for his bar mitzvah -- yes , his full bar mitzvah for 100 people in a big temple			1
thanks also go to two schools that have helped him greatly : @entity216 and his current program at @entity218			1
since decision - making is difficult for @entity13 , choosing " what to be " on @entity221 is always an exasperating time and high on the it ( inciting tantrum ) list			0
this year , for the first time , @entity13 was positive he wanted to be a pirate			0
we went to the @entity227 and picked out a perfect pirate costume , eye patch and attachable parrot included			0
@entity13 was excited and i held my breath as we waited on a long line to check out , hoping that he would n't change his mind			0
and he did n't ! that is , until we got into the car and he blurted out , " i do n't want to be a pirate ! i hate pirates ! pirates are stupid ! i want to be a witch ! " my mind races : did i force this choice on him ? i pull the car over			0
i take several deep breaths			0
i say , " @entity13 look at me			0
i had a happy face all day and now look at me			0
do i look happy ? " he turns his head in my direction and glances over to me			0
" no , no , " he says			0
" that 's right , you are upsetting me , @entity13			1
" then he says , " upsetting is a bad word for @entity253 ! " and then in a flash , i say , " what is a good word for @entity253 ? " before i can come up with one , @entity13 says , " @entity257 , @entity257 is a good word for @entity253 ! " this is a miracle			0
" yes ! " i say , " @entity257 is a perfect word for @entity253 ! " i burst out in tears			0
the spell is broken ! two miracles just occurred : there was no tantrum , and @entity13 saw i was unhappy and realized the cause of it was his behavior			0
yes , @entity13 the opposite of @entity270 is united ! we are united ! last summer , @entity13 and i went to visit our angel and his long - time therapist , @entity273 , at her home in @entity275			0
it was raining as we drove down a dirt road on our way to a friend 's farm			1
@entity13 was looking intently out the window at the fields and pastures we were passing , and he said quietly , " i can see all of @entity285 's paintings			1
thank you @entity285 for all the blessings i like			0
" and i thank you too , @entity285 , for the blessing of my beautiful , innocent son			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2			1

@entity2 says she tried to deny the *seriousness* of her son 's struggle with autism
she says her son went through many different kinds of therapies
eventually they found caring people who helped him progress , she says
