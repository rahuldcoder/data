@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a quiet corner of southern @entity1 's @entity5 , hundreds of abandoned watchtowers dot a landscape of water - logged rice paddies , lush bamboo groves and ancient villages			2
bristling with battlements and turrets , the ornate towers were built by families and villages in need of protection during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when much of the country was controlled by warlords and banditry was rife			2
now a @entity23 world heritage site , these days the @entity0 watchtowers , or diaolou as they are known locally , face a threat of a different nature -- the incredible boom in @entity31 tourism			1
the tiny village of @entity33 , which has the largest collection of towers , attracts dozens of tour buses on weekends			0
their passengers are ushered around the towers by guides sporting red flags and microphones rigged up to loud speakers			0
they chase the skinny chickens that roam about the dirt paths , snap photos , sample " peasant family food " and buy rustic bamboo souvenirs , while the village 's few remaining elderly residents sit on small plastic stools and look on bemused			0
it 's a scene that 's played out at other @entity23 sites across @entity1 , where world heritage status is increasingly being used as a economic vehicle to develop backward regions , says @entity57 , a professor of tourism at the @entity59 in @entity60			1
" the idea behind having this status is that there are conservation , preservation and restoration issues , where in @entity1 it seems to be primarily geared toward promoting tourism and its economic benefit , " says @entity57 , who has studied @entity0 and another world heritage site in @entity63 province , eastern @entity1			1
@entity1 plans makeover for tourism in southeast @entity75 according to @entity57 , @entity31 made 2.6 billion trips last year , up from just over a billion seven years ago and numbers are expected to rise further			1
" places that were previously very remote and did n't see a lot of tourists are now seeing enormous numbers arriving because they have the money to travel , " says @entity78 , group director of the @entity79 , which has worked in @entity1 since 1989			1
" it 's an interesting phenomenon because it 's in complete contrast to the experience in @entity89 , where almost all the visitors are foreigners			0
" @entity1 now has 43 world heritage sites , the most of any country in the world			1
dozens of other wannabe @entity23 sites across @entity1 are preparing bids			2
@entity98 , the @entity99 - based chief of @entity23 's @entity101 and @entity102 section , says that the prestige of world heritage inscription always means an increase in visitor numbers but acknowledges the pressures of mass tourism in @entity1 are particularly acute			1
" people are getting richer and they have the right to appreciate heritage sites but we need a balance , " he says			1
new parts of @entity115 to open to tourists tackling the problem is difficult			0
@entity98 singles out @entity118 , an ancient town set in a dramatic mountain landscape in the southwestern province of @entity122 , as a place that has struggled to accommodate a surge in tourists			0
designated a world heritage site in 1997 , the town , home to the matriarchal @entity129 culture , now receives 11 million visitors a year and conservation experts have been shocked by the level of commercialization			1
locals have moved out of the city 's ancient core , renting their homes out to businesses			0
@entity98 was part of a @entity23 monitoring mission to the town in 2008 and local authorities have pledged to improve visitor management and shut the discos and karaoke bars that had sprung up			0
however , a doubling of admission ticket prices in a bid to reduce visitor numbers has had little impact and officials aim to increase visitor number to 16 million by 2015			0
@entity23 has only twice removed world heritage sites from its list and @entity98 says there is little chance , for now at least , that any @entity31 sites would lose the designation because authorities had put forward " corrective measures			1
" ethnic @entity162 in @entity1 concerned about cultural threat poor , rural areas bypassed by @entity1 's recent economic boom are those most keen to secure world heritage status , says @entity167 , who works for the @entity168 in @entity1			1
local officials often take out huge loans to build infrastructure to prepare their bid , she says , and local people , at least , initially welcome the opportunity to find work outside farming or as alternative to migration			0
" having world heritage status definitely changes your property values , your investment opportunities and it 's a really big life - saver for a lot of these places , " she says			2
officials in charge of @entity0 's watchtowers have said they aim to attract up to 2 million visitors each year , up from 100,000 in 2007 when it was first inscribed as a world heritage site with a view to generating revenues of 50 million yuan ( us $ 7.8 million )			1
how this money will be spent will be key to the future of @entity0 's watchtowers			2
so far , it appears that much of the money generated has been spent on car parks , ticket booths and landscaping in the four villages featured in tourist brochures			2
it 's not clear what will happen to the hundreds of other towers not earmarked for tourist development			2
they are used as barns and storage sheds or stand empty and forlorn despite their protected status			0
many were abandoned after the @entity215 victory in 1949 when those with overseas ties fled			0
more recently , villagers have left for the booming factory towns on the other side of the @entity5			0
@entity221 added to @entity23 's world heritage list the challenge for the local authorities in @entity0 , and at @entity1 's other heritage sites , is how to manage tourists visits so that they bring maximum economic benefit without harming the heritage sites and those who live nearby			1
one radical solution is to limit visitor numbers			0
for example , from next year the @entity232 in remote @entity1 plans to allow 6,000 visitors per day , down from up to 11,000 at present , says @entity78 at the @entity79			2
the move follows fears that the moisture from visitors ' breath and sweat was harming the centuries - old cave paintings and @entity243 sculptures			0
but this approach is unlikely to be adopted widely , especially at living sites such as @entity118 's old town and @entity0 , where economic imperatives are most likely to trump heritage preservation			1
" world heritage sites do n't need to be static -- they can bring income and development , " says @entity167 at the @entity168			1
" but i think it 's important to remember that heritage does have its own inherent value and it 's not just about a tangible financial return			0

@entity1 has 43 world heritage sites , the most of any country
some sites struggle to cope with boom in *domestic* tourism
@entity31 made 2.6 billion trips last year as more have money to travel
fears emerge that economic development may clash with heritage preservation
