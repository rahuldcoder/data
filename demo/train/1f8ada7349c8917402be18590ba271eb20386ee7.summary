the cosmetics section of any department store anywhere in the world might usually be the first thing you encounter when you walk through the door , but in @entity6 it 's often a mirror maze on a vast and dazzling scale			1
there are serried ranks of demonstrations as shop assistants jostle for attention armed with @entity14 moisturizers , @entity17 all - in - one @entity15 and @entity19 lip glosses and violet eye shadows			2
if department stores in @entity23 are the battle ground for its emerging middle classes , then the cosmetics counter is its front line			2
big demand in @entity6 , cosmetics now outstrips groceries as the biggest selling item in its department stores , according to a report from @entity33			1
in 2013 , @entity35 women , and increasingly men , spent 162.5 billion yuan ( $ 26 billion ) on cosmetics in an industry that showed 13.3 % growth year - on - year , according to the same report citing figures from @entity42			1
@entity19 's annual beauty and personal care market is still the largest in the region at about $ 50 billion , second in the world only to the @entity47 ( which is about $ 70 billion ) , according to @entity42			1
but @entity6 's 150 million - strong middle class is closing the gap fast			1
for them , however , ground zero in terms of models of beauty is increasingly @entity17			2
while @entity17 's domestic market is only a third the size of @entity6 , in terms of soft power the country punches well above its weight thanks to @entity23 's insatiable appetite for @entity17 drama series and their stars			2
@entity6 's middle class is expected to grow to 500 million within a decade			1
by 2030 around one billion people in @entity6 could be middle class -- as much as 70 % of its projected population , according to a report from @entity71			1
in terms of brands , according to @entity42 , @entity6 continued to hold the leading position in the @entity35 cosmetics market in 2013 with a value share of 34 %			1
and while @entity17 brands might be little known outside the region , thanks to the popularity of k - pop and @entity17 soap operas -- whose stars such as @entity85 and @entity86 and @entity87 of @entity88 are household names in the @entity78 -- @entity17 beauty brands are now the hottest ticket item in @entity6			1
star power one @entity17 brand in particular , @entity94 ( meaning the " the snow " in @entity14 ) and made by @entity17 's @entity96 , is popular among @entity6 's middle classes			1
with its blue and white design and @entity14 cachet , the skincare product benefits from the soft power of being @entity17 and , more importantly , cheaper			0
@entity103 , director of global innovation at market researcher @entity105 , said @entity17 beauty and personal care retail market posted 5.8 % growth year - on - year to 2013 compared with just 2.1 % for the @entity110 and 3.9 % for the @entity47			1
" the success of @entity17 brands has a lot to do with @entity35 consumers copying the style of @entity17 soap opera and music stars , " @entity103 told @entity111			0
" they 'll even go so far as to get the particular products being used by these stars			0
the stores will try to get in the exact shades that @entity17 actresses are using			0
" she said the same way that @entity127 and @entity128 will get catwalk styles in quickly , @entity17 retailers will do the same with cosmetics			0
" this is particularly true with lip color , " @entity103 said			0
hot market increasingly , however , @entity17 is setting the standard for the growing market in skincare products , creating the all - in - one @entity15 -- which contain tints , moisturizer and even sunblock -- that have become so popular in @entity23			2
" @entity17 is really the hot market for innovation and it 's even overtaken markets like @entity19 as the place where everyone looks for the experts in skincare			2
the @entity35 are fascinated by facial skincare and by face color cosmetics , " @entity103 said			0
" @entity17 women are very much held up as the standard of beauty across @entity23			0
" despite the coverage that @entity17 brands have received recently , it is still brands from @entity157 and the @entity47 that rule the roost in @entity6			0
beauty expertise " @entity165 brands such as @entity166 still have the brand recognition in @entity6 , " @entity103 said , adding that because @entity17 brands have been slowing recently , they have been marketing more aggressively in the @entity35 market with products aimed directly at @entity35 consumers			1
apart from creating brands that build on the idea that @entity17 has a special expertise in terms of @entity23 beauty , @entity17 cosmetics are seen as lighter and more fun than their @entity165 counterparts			0
" they are very quick to use catchy new ingredients , thick textures and they 're very careful with their pricing , " she said			0
in the meantime , however , @entity35 brands have not been slow to sell in their own markets with brands such as @entity187 emerging as a major competitor to @entity165 brands , especially third and fourth - tier cities in @entity6			0
" there 's a certain cachet with @entity14 brands , however , and it 's amusing to see @entity35 brands creating names in @entity35 that , when pronounced phonetically , sound very much like @entity14 names , " @entity103 said			0
