@entity0 -- the suspect in the @entity4 bombing attempt was caught as he was seeking to flee to @entity5 , a nation that analyst @entity6 calls the " epicenter of @entity9 terrorism			1
" " it 's worth noting that even the terrorism that 's often attributed to the war in @entity12 tends to come out of @entity5 , to be planned by @entity5 , to be funded from @entity5 or in some other way to be traced to @entity5 , " said @entity6			1
he added that @entity5 's connection with terrorist groups goes back decades and has often been encouraged by that nation 's military for strategic reasons			1
@entity20 , a 30 - year - old naturalized citizen of @entity5 descent , had recently been trained in bomb making in @entity5 's @entity24 province , according to a federal complaint filed in court tuesday			1
@entity1 reported tuesday that @entity20 's father is a retired vice-marshal in the @entity28			0
@entity20 was arrested around 11:45 p.m. et monday at @entity0 's @entity29 just before he was to fly to @entity30 , @entity5 , by way of @entity32			2
@entity6 , author and host of @entity1 's " @entity34 , " spoke to @entity1 on tuesday			2
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : based on what we know so far , what lessons can be learned from this incident ? @entity6 : this does not seem to be part of a larger and more organized effort to penetrate the @entity44			1
that does n't mean such efforts are not under way ...			0
it does make you realize just how open we are as a country and how open we are as a society			0
there is always a level of vulnerability that comes from being an open society and this guy , mr. @entity20 obviously took advantage of that openness			0
@entity1 : apparently he traveled to @entity5 on a number of occasions			2
does that signal that @entity5 is n't vigilant enough about terrorism ? @entity6 : well it certainly signals something that we have known for a while , which is that @entity5 is the epicenter of @entity9 terrorism			1
... the @entity71 government has estimated that something like 80 percent of the terror threats that they receive have a @entity5 connection			2
so there 's no question that @entity5 has a terrorism problem			2
it has radical groups within the country that have the ability to recruit people and have access to resources that makes for a very combustible mixture			0
it should remind us that even when looking at the war in @entity12 , ultimately the most important place where jihadis are being trained and recruited is not in @entity12 but in @entity5			2
and there 's no other part of the world where you have quite the same concentration of manpower , resources and ideology all feeding on each other			0
@entity1 : what feeds the ideology that drives the terror effort ? @entity6 : @entity5 has been conducive to this kind of jihadis for a number of reasons			1
for the last three or four decades , the @entity5 government , the @entity5 military has supported , funded many of these groups in a bid to maintain influence in @entity12 , in a bid to maintain an asymmetrical capacity against @entity113 -- in other words , to try to destabilize @entity113 rather cheaply through these militant groups rather than frontally through its army			1
so it has found it useful to have these militant groups and to support them			1
it has always assumed that these groups will not attack @entity5 and therefore was not a threat to @entity5 itself			2
and to a large extent that 's true , these groups by and large have attacked people in @entity12 , @entity113 , in the @entity122 but not in @entity5			1
but that is changing , because these groups are so intermingled and often sufficiently ideological , and also because the @entity5 military is beginning to take them on			1
but fundamentally the reason this has gone on is that there has been a policy of the @entity5 state and particularly the @entity5 military , to encourage these groups , to fund them , to ignore their most pernicious activities			1
and some of it goes back even further than four decades			0
in the 1965 war against @entity113 , the @entity5 used @entity9 jihadis ... and the great hope now is that finally the @entity5 government is getting serious about this			1
frankly it remains a hope			0
@entity1 : why do you say that it 's only a hope ? @entity6 : over the last few years , it appears that the @entity5 government has begun to understand that these groups all meld together , that they are a threat to a stable and viable modern @entity5 state			1
but when i talk about the @entity5 government you have to realize that there are different elements in it			0
the @entity5 civilian government really does understand the danger that @entity9 terrorism poses to @entity5 , but the civilian government in @entity5 appears quite powerless			1
most power lies with the military			0
the military in @entity5 has a somewhat more complex attitude			2
it does believe that these militants have gone too far			0
it does believe that it has to take on the militants			0
and it has actually battled them quite bravely over the last few years			0
@entity1 : so what 's the reason for thinking the military supports militant groups ? @entity6 : it still holds within it the view that at the end of the day , the @entity44 will leave the region and that they will have to live in a neighborhood which will have a very powerful @entity113 and an @entity12 that is potentially a client state of @entity113 's -- and that in order to combat this @entity113 domination , they need to maintain their asymmetrical capabilities , their militant groups			1
it is interesting to note that @entity176 , who may be the most respected @entity5 journalist , has reported on the way in which @entity5 government has thwarted and put obstacles in the way of any kind of talks between the @entity12 government and the @entity184			0
the message it has sent to the @entity12 government is very clear			0
if you want to have any negotiations with the @entity184 , you have to understand that since we are the critical intermediary -- since the @entity184 leadership all lives in @entity5 -- the @entity5 military 's terms to the @entity12 government are , we want you to push back on @entity113 influence in @entity12 , we want you to shut down @entity113 consulates in various @entity12 cities			1
in other words , the @entity5 government is still obsessed with the idea of an @entity113 domination of the region , and they 're using their influence with the @entity184 to try to counter @entity113 influence			1
this is the old game that the @entity5 have played			0
that 's what makes me skeptical that there 's been a true strategic revolution in @entity5 ... there are still people who believe that there are good terrorists and bad terrorists , and some you can work with to further @entity5 's goals			1
@entity1 : in the attempted car bombing in @entity4 and the @entity217 attempted bombing , you have two failed plots that do n't appear to be highly sophisticated			0
does that tell us anything about the terror groups ? @entity6 : at some level , that tells you about the weakness of the terror groups			2
you do not have highly organized terrorist groups with great resources and capacity that are able to plan spectacular acts of terrorism the way they were in the 1990s and on 9/11			2
what you have now are more isolated , disorganized lone rangers and while they 're obviously very worrying and one has to be extremely vigilant , it is also at some level a sign of the weakness of an organization like @entity242 that it is not able to do the kind of terrorist attacks it used to			0
to be sure , it 's important to be very vigilant and make sure you have groups like @entity242 on the run			0
but i do n't know that in a free society , you will ever be able to prevent an individual with no background in terrorism who 's broken no laws and is radicalized from attempting to make some kind of trouble .			0
