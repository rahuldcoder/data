@entity10 ' queen mary 2 sails into @entity11			0
@entity12 says it has kits to aid rape investigations aboard			2
but sexual and physical assaults were the leading crimes committed onboard cruise ships in recent years , the @entity16 says			1
in march , a 42 - year - old female passenger aboard the @entity21 says a @entity23 crew member sexually assaulted her during a cruise , according to an @entity16 affidavit			1
the woman met the 38 - year - old crew member for drinks in a dining room on the cruise ship operated by @entity31 , which did not respond to @entity0 's request for comment			1
the friendly encounter turned terrifying , the woman told the @entity16 , after her assailant blocked the doors to the room , trapping her inside , and forced her to perform oral sex			1
" travelers have this idea they are in a special cocoon where nothing bad can happen , " says @entity40 , a leading maritime lawyer in @entity41 , @entity42 , who is representing the alleged victim from the @entity21 and has handled more than a hundred cruise assault cases in the last decade			1
" that 's just not true			0
" addressing cruise ship violence has become an important issue for lawmakers as the $ 22 billion cruise industry proliferates			2
about 12 million @entity54 will set sail on a cruise this year , according to the @entity57 , a trade organization representing the industry			2
@entity60 crimes have made headlines in recent years , like the @entity62 newlywed who vanished from his @entity65 honeymoon cruise in 2005			2
last tuesday , the @entity66 began searching for a passenger who went missing on a @entity69 cruise ship			2

@entity76 , deputy assistant director at the @entity16 in 2007 , told lawmakers that the @entity16 opened 184 cases on crimes that occurred aboard cruise ships between 2002 and early 2007			1
the cruise industry points out that those numbers are small when compared with the number of passengers served by the industry -- about 64 million in that same five - year period			1
sen. @entity87 of @entity88 and rep. @entity89 of @entity90 have introduced the 2009 @entity91 , which requires the cruise industry to publicly report crimes and improve safety on board			1
it mandates peepholes and security latches in cabins			2
this week , several victims of cruise crimes will meet with senators to discuss the issue			2
the cruise industry says that it is " working closely " with lawmakers on the bill and that passenger safety is a top priority			2
@entity65 , the second - largest cruise vacation company , has closed - circuit television cameras in hundreds of public locations on its ships , according to the company 's web site			1
@entity12 , which operates luxury cruises , would n't share security details with @entity0 but said its ships carry kits that investigators need to gather evidence of rape			1
the number of attacks on ships is probably higher than reported , sexual assault experts say , because rape victims are afraid to come forward on an isolated ship with perpetrators in close quarters			1
they also say cruise travelers are at a higher risk for attack because of readily available alcohol and a partying mentality on the vessels , which haul an average of 2,000 passengers each from across the globe			1
of the attacks investigated by the @entity16 , a majority involved the use of alcohol			1
cruise lines disagree , saying people are safer on the ships than they are in their own communities			1
the companies provide 24 - hour security and screen passengers ' belongings			1

" some attorneys say the security and medical authorities aboard the ships may be biased in their investigations			1
" the cruise workers are paid by the cruise lines			1
do you honestly think the cruise ship doctor will be favorable toward the victim ? " says @entity186 , a maritime attorney in @entity187 , @entity90			0
vessels need independent , third - party security officers and cruise doctors , critics say			1
they point out that even the airline industry has federal air marshals on planes with international itineraries			0
attorneys for the victims also point out that @entity16 statistics on cruise crime show that in nearly half of the incidents , a crew member is the suspect , which may deter victims from coming forward because they do n't know which employees to trust			1
the @entity57 says on its web site that the industry 's work force is prescreened by the @entity212 , which is responsible for issuing work visas to foreigners working on ships that stop in @entity75 ports			0
many passengers are unaware that being on a cruise ship is equivalent to being in a foreign country			2
vessels are typically foreign - flagged from countries like @entity222 and @entity223			0
cruise lines are n't obligated to follow the crime investigation and reporting guidelines that law enforcement would follow on @entity75 soil , attorneys say			1
filing lawsuits can also be difficult when the crime occurs in foreign waters because the trials can sometimes take place in courts abroad			0
" they [ cruise lines ] will commit to nothing , " says @entity236 , president of @entity237 , a nonprofit group			1
" they will sell you the tickets , " he says , " and then fail to take responsibility			0

@entity257 , 38 , testified before @entity258 that she was raped aboard a @entity65 ship three years ago			0
she said cruise staff instructed her to gather evidence , so she and a friend went to the cabin where the assault occurred and piled her clothes and bed sheets into plastic bags they were given			0
" we did n't know what we were doing , " says @entity257			0
she said she was later told by authorities there was n't enough evidence to prosecute a criminal case			0
" it makes me frustrated looking back that the cruise lines did n't handle evidence properly			1
" @entity257 's suit against @entity65 was settled in early 2008			0
she says she ca n't disclose the amount			0
cruise industry officials say their security officers are trained in how to preserve evidence			2
@entity69 , the largest cruise company in the world , says its security personnel must have previous security , military or law enforcement experience			2
even if evidence is gathered properly by cruise security , the time that elapses between the crime and @entity16 involvement may threaten the integrity of an investigation			1
in the @entity21 case in march , three days passed before the ship docked in @entity90 and @entity16 agents could step aboard			1
that incident , however , was handled in exemplary fashion , say attorneys and even some cruise line critics			0
the evidence was sufficient enough for the @entity75 district attorney 's office in the @entity304 of @entity90 to charge the alleged offender , @entity305 , with aggravated sexual abuse			0
@entity305 is pleading not guilty to the federal offense , which carries a possible life sentence			0
@entity305 says the encounter was consensual , according to his attorney			0
@entity311 , a spokesman for the @entity75 district attorney 's office prosecuting @entity305 , said charging offenders with cruise - related crimes can also be complicated by challenges such as tracking key witnesses abroad			2
the biggest threat , though , is the time lag , when valuable evidence can disappear or be tampered with , he said			0
" when we can bring the case , we 'll bring the case , " he said			0
" @entity305 is a good example			0
