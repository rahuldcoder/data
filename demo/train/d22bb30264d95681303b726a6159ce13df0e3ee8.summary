-- @entity1 has a lot on her mind for a 15 - year - old			0
along with schoolwork and friends , she 's also got a good shot at making the @entity10 @entity9 snowboarding team			0
ranked among the world 's top 10 female snowboarders , @entity1 's unique talents include riding up the steep walls of snow - covered " halfpipes " and vaulting herself off the edge and high into the air			0
being airborne with a board under your feet , she says , " feels like nothing can touch you			0
" but a deadly h1n1 flu pandemic has added a new kind of hurdle for @entity1 and other @entity9 hopefuls , as athletes and authorities hope for the best while preparing for the worst			1
" if i do get the flu , it could really affect my asthma and then affect my performance and i would n't want that to happen			2
" the prospect of potential virus carriers converging on @entity38 , @entity39 , next month from all corners of the world has prompted @entity43 and @entity10 authorities to exercise abundant caution			0
the @entity45 is strongly urging all its athletes traveling to @entity38 to get the flu vaccination			1
but some athletes are ignoring the committee 's recommendation , and officials ca n't make the vaccines mandatory			2
although 40 percent of @entity38 - area residents have been vaccinated , these games still offer the virus a nice , big playpen , say health officials			0
they point out that the @entity59 city of more than 2 million is the largest host of any @entity61			1
like troops advancing across a battlefield , @entity62 has produced two global waves so far			1
the pandemic 's first wave in april 2009 got the attention of @entity9 hopefuls , who often tend to be young			2
" more young people were being hospitalized and ended up staying in hospitals longer , " said dr. @entity70 , director of communicable disease control for @entity72 , the regional health care provider			0
@entity62 has claimed 10 lives and led to the hospitalization of more than 250 people in the @entity38 area since the pandemic began , she said			1
" i do n't expect influenza to be a major issue during the @entity9 , " said @entity70			0
" however , you ca n't count on that			0
" as a result , officials are preparing for the possibility of a third wave			2
" we figure that we 'll be able to blunt it quite a bit , " said @entity72 spokeswoman @entity89			0
experts say as few as a dozen flu carriers traveling to attend all 16 days of the games could spread @entity62 to hundreds of people			1
in an extreme scenario , illness could force @entity61 coaches to dig deeply into their player reserves for replacements , depending on each sport 's rules , which are set by international governing boards			1
would flu fears force officials to cancel @entity9 events ? " in all of pandemic planning it has been recognized for some time that cancellation of mass gatherings is not an effective way to control influenza , " @entity70 said			2
" i can categorically say that we are not planning that			0
" @entity43 health officials will be using a stockpile of vaccine to make the shots easily available during the games -- although experts point out that it takes seven to 10 days to develop immunity after the vaccine			2
" arriving here and getting a shot might not be the best way to protect yourself , " said @entity123 , who recommends getting the vaccine well before traveling to the games			0
also included in @entity38 's arsenal against @entity62 : millions of doses of @entity132 anti-viral medication and media campaigns promoting hand washing			1
30 ways to outsmart the flu hospitals and clinics have been designated for an expected 5,500 athletes and staff , about 10,000 media workers and at least 250,000 spectators			1
lawmaker @entity142 has accused @entity43 's federal government of " dropping the ball " by not providing enough resources to deliver @entity62 vaccinations -- a charge the government disputes			1
" however , the local health authorities have a done a great job of putting an effective plan in place , " said @entity150 , who represents @entity38 in the @entity43 @entity151			2
providing security for the games will be about 20,500 military and police officers , according to the @entity160			1
what if their ranks are thinned by a massive flu outbreak ? a backup army of about 750 military and civilian personnel will be on standby just in case			1
" they 've all been inoculated and they 're ready to go at a moment 's notice , " said @entity168 spokesman staff sgt. @entity167			0
' just self - isolation -- nothing draconian ' @entity38 's plan during a worst - case outbreak does not include quarantining athletes or anyone else , said @entity70			1
quarantining an area , which means separating everyone including those who do n't show any symptoms , is n't an effective way to control influenza , she said			1
instead , emergency plans call for quickly isolating only those who show flu - like symptoms			1
" just self - isolation , nothing draconian , " said @entity70			0
rooms have been set aside in case sick athletes need to be separated from their teammates , said top @entity45 chiropractic physician dr. @entity191			1
athletes are not more likely to contract the flu because of close contact with other athletes during competitions or in locker rooms , said @entity70			1
however , athletes who train too hard may be more susceptible , said @entity191			0
test your knowledge with the @entity62 quiz the shot does n't affect athletic performance , said @entity191			1
neither will it taint a urine test for performance - enhancing drugs , according to the @entity208 , which oversees @entity61 drug testing			2
' it 's not about fear ' although @entity191 and other @entity61 officials around the globe are strongly urging all athletes to get the vaccine , some are refusing it			1
" it 's not about fear , " said @entity191			0
" they do n't want something changing up in their training schedule			0
they do n't want something different and we have to accept that			0
" among those refusing the shot is @entity231 member and 2006 gold medalist @entity232			1
" i have never taken a flu shot and would not consider the @entity62 vaccine , because i believe that you can stay healthier without the risk of any side effects or long term risks that come with vaccinations , " @entity232 said in an e-mail to @entity0			1
side effects after an @entity62 vaccine would be rare , according to the @entity243			2
they include soreness , redness or swelling around where the shot was given , as well as fainting , headache , muscle aches , fever and nausea			0
medical observers will be conducting " very intense communicable disease surveillance " at hospital emergency rooms and elsewhere looking for signs of an outbreak , said @entity70			2
as they plan for the worst , @entity38 health officials are expressing confidence			0
they say they have history on their side			0
" let 's remember : there was a flu pandemic during the @entity266 and it had no effect whatsoever on the games , " said @entity123			0

largest host city of any @entity61 prepares for possible new wave of @entity62
750 *soldiers* , police on standby in case massive flu outbreak strikes security forces
emergency plan calls for athletes , staffers , spectators with symptoms to be isolated
