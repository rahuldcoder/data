-- the early hours of " @entity1 : @entity7 " take gamers around the world and back again , but the new game 's story hits close to home			1
military scenarios , violent police actions and straight - from - the - big - screen massive firefights take place in such far - flung locales as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
but things do n't really get interesting until the action moves to @entity19 and the player is embedded in a squad of terrorists			1
and then , inevitably , the fight comes to @entity25 shores			1
" @entity7 , " a first - person shooter released tuesday for the @entity30 , @entity31 and pc , is a greatly immersive experience that embeds players in the battlefield			1
limited edition of @entity30 there 's no place in the world where a skirmish ca n't go down , from airport security lines to the neighborhood burger joint to your own backyard			2
it 's an unsettling notion and one sure to inspire plenty of parental hand - wringing , particularly for those who buy their kids the live - the - action box set that includes a pair of night - vision goggles			0
night - vision goggles experience ( spoiler alert : the moments i 'm about to relate describe the plot of " @entity7 " -- not where the game finally goes , but the early incidents that establish the conflict and tension of the game			1
some readers may consider these to be spoilers			0
) @entity19 is where the already - controversial " no @entity19 " scene goes down			1
as @entity66 , players go undercover with @entity67 -- an underling of the villain from " @entity70 : @entity7			2
" along with @entity67 and other terrorists , the player finds themselves in the midst of a terrible situation			2
the fully armed @entity67 and crew waltz into a @entity19 airport and open fire on civilians standing in a security line			2
as @entity82 , the player can take part in the bloodshed or simply walk alongside the cold - blooded killers as they execute hundreds of innocents			2
either way , the scene is powerful			0
it 's also the oldest trick in the book : the quickest way to turn audiences against your villain is to show them doing dirty deeds , and @entity67 's murderous spree is a doozy			0
@entity82 does n't walk away from the bloodbath			0
once outside the terminal , players must fend off waves of incoming @entity104 teams			0
if there 's any kind of karmic debt that @entity82 owes for his role in the slayings , the guy pays it : at the end of the tarmac firefight , @entity67 puts a bullet in @entity82			0
he knew all along that the ranger was a rat			0
@entity82 's body at the scene of the tragedy triggers @entity19 outrage and , eventually , a " @entity122 " - style invasion of the @entity25			1
