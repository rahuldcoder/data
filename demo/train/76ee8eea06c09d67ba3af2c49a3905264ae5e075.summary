-- referring to two @entity4 hikers in custody for more than two years , @entity2 president @entity1 told reporters tuesday : " i am helping to arrange for the release in a couple of days so they will be able to return home			1
" the semi-official @entity11 quickly echoed the president with a headline , " @entity2 's @entity14 agrees to release two @entity4 citizens on bail			1
" within 24 hours , however , the @entity18 clerics who run @entity2 's legal system seemed to pour cold water on hopes of a quick release by declaring the " request to release two @entity4 citizens on bail was under study			1
" they went on to warn the media and the @entity4 that " only reports published by the judiciary could be trusted			0
" at first glance these developments present the @entity2 president as a loose cannon , adding to his reputation as a @entity35 denier and 9/11 conspiracy adherent			2
all those characterizations do apply to @entity1			0
but the recent twist in the hikers ' plight reflects more than an erratic chief executive or a regime in @entity43 that lacks coordination			0
it represents the latest skirmish in an increasingly high - stakes battle for the future of @entity2 's politics and society			1
at the heart of the tussle between @entity1 and his former clerical mentors is the question of whether the @entity57 republic and its system of velayat - e faqih , or governance by an @entity57 jurist , should endure or be discarded as a disastrous experiment just as a previous attempt by clergymen to rule @entity2 failed during the @entity65 of antiquity			1
regarding those hikers , the @entity2 government 's executive branch , including its @entity69 , lobbied publicly for dropping the charges			1
@entity1 and his appointees , like many other @entity2 , see little to gain from continued imprisonment of the two @entity4			1
the presidential office has more pressing matters -- such as a deteriorating economy -- that demand attention			0
it needs a deal with the @entity80 that allows oversight of @entity2 's nuclear program by the @entity83 in exchange for a lifting of sanctions that would permit foreign capital and goods to reinvigorate local business			1
the executive branch also has bigger fish to fry ideologically -- its officials realize many @entity2 are tired of the @entity93 and of paying for the negative implications of preserving theocracy			2
so @entity1 and his appointees have learned from the protests of 2009 and launched their own rebellion within the governing elite			0
mullahs who subscribe to @entity18 fundamentalist politics endorsed @entity1 for the presidency in 2005 , expecting him to implement their will through the executive branch			0
they even went along with much - contested results of the 2009 presidential election despite @entity1 's increasing disregard of mandates from @entity108 ayatollah @entity107 and the theocratic branch of the government , hoping he could be forced to toe their line			0
what the mullahs did not fully realize until recently is that @entity1 and his supporters have little reason to be loyal to @entity107 and other clergymen for the system of velayat - e faqih is closed to nonclerics			0
rather than ascribe to @entity18 fundamentalism , as do members of the theocratic and judicial branches of @entity2 's government , @entity1 , his chief of staff and close confidant , @entity128 , and those who support them have been championing @entity2 's past			1
they laud prophets , kings and poets such as @entity136 , who preached the world 's first monotheism in the second millennium @entity140 ; @entity142 , who founded the first @entity65 in the sixth century @entity140 ; and @entity143 , who composed the country 's national epic in the 11th century -- referring to that past as the " school of @entity2			2
" @entity57 pales when compared to those achievements and so does the theocratic state of modern @entity2 , they insist			2
not surprisingly the mullahs have begun denouncing @entity1 and his appointees as a " deviant current " that seeks to " restrict the powers of the supreme leader , increase the authority of the elected president , base authority within the executive and parliamentary branches of government , use public referendums rather than clerical edicts , and change the @entity161 ... in order to dismantle clerical rule			0
" the powerful @entity165 leadership finds its ranks divided between the warring factions of @entity2 's polity			1
like the president , military officers and conscripts are rarely from clerical families and historically have thrown their lot in with @entity2 's secular leadership			1
consequently when @entity165 commander @entity175 , who was appointed by and is loyal to the mullahs , threatened " military action against the president and all others who disavow the @entity93 , " accusations of contemplating a coup were leveled			0
even the @entity183 's founder , ayatollah @entity182 , was quoted posthumously as prohibiting military units from intervening in politics			0
within the context of @entity2 's intra-regime struggle , the hikers ' conviction on charges of illegal entry and espionage by a judiciary under cleric @entity192 emerges as yet another attempt by xenophobic mullahs to thwart @entity1 's albeit fumbling attempts to re-engage the @entity4			1
@entity1 's offer of a " unilateral pardon of course on behalf of the @entity2 nation " was in turn a warning shot to those clergymen that he could exercise the presidency 's constitutional authority if this matter is not resolved satisfactorily			2
like his other defiant acts , which include ousting fundamentalists from the @entity211 and bureaucracy , it also was a means of conveying to @entity2 that the president is seeking " closure of the era in which clergy call the shots			2
" even in ideal circumstances , @entity2 's supreme leader has to navigate most cautiously between competing political factions within the branches of government to retain his position			1
these are far from the best of times in @entity43			0
@entity107 conceded recently that " the supreme @entity57 jurist can not act solely according to his inclination			0
" @entity1 , although rightly abhorred on the world stage for his bad words and deeds , is far from politically impotent and will likely continue to press an increasingly secularist vision of government upon the mullahs , knowing his new stances make him one of the three most popular politicians , none of them fundamentalists , within @entity2			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			0

@entity240 : the *uncertain* status of two @entity4 hikers reflects @entity2 divisions
he says president @entity247 is locked in struggle with mullahs
