@entity0 -- education secretary @entity2 said wednesday his department estimates that four out of five schools in the @entity5 will not make their " @entity6 " benchmarks by the law 's target year of 2014 -- and when the test scores are counted for the current school year , numbers could show that @entity5 schools are already at that failure rate			1
he blamed that failure rate on the law itself , not on schools			0
" this law has created dozens of ways for schools to fail and very few ways to help them succeed			0
we should get out of the business of labeling schools as failures and create a new law that is fair and flexible , and focused on the schools and students most at risk , " @entity2 told the @entity22			2
under the @entity6 law , originally passed in 2001 , all students are expected to meet a level of " proficiency " by 2014			0
because standards under @entity6 are higher from year to year as 2014 approaches , the percentage of schools that are not meeting " @entity40 " could rise from the current level of 37 % to 82 % , @entity2 said			1
@entity2 pointed out that federal law requires states and districts to " implement the same set of interventions in every school that is not meeting @entity40 , regardless of the individual needs and circumstances of those schools			1
" under the @entity53 's estimates , 82 % of @entity5 's schools " could be labeled ' failing ' and , over time , the required remedies for all of them are the same -- which means we will really fail to serve the students in greatest need , " said @entity2			1
" by mandating and prescribing one - size - fits - all solutions , @entity6 took away the ability of local and state educators to tailor solutions to the unique needs of their students , " @entity2 said calling the concept " fundamentally flawed			2
" @entity2 was on @entity66 to both push for the reauthorization and revamping of the @entity6 law , and to defend president @entity71 's budget request for 2012			2
the 2012 budget request comes to $ 77.4 billion -- an increase of $ 4.5 billion over the 2011 request			0
republicans on the committee questioned any increase in the budget in the current economic climate			0
@entity22 chairman rep. @entity80 , @entity81 , said in his opening remarks , " as we work to answer the question about the appropriate role for the federal government in education , one thing is for sure : it must be less costly and less intrusive			0
" rep. @entity89 , @entity90 , asked the secretary if he though he could be successful without an increase in funding saying , " if you cut the right way and put the money into the systems that you know work , could you do that ? " the education secretary answered , " we have to do that , anyway , and i continue to think we under - invest " compared to higher - performing countries .			1

education secretary @entity2 testifies before a *congressional* committee
almost 40 % of @entity5 schools are not now meeting goals for " @entity6 , " he says
that could increase to 82 % , he says
because standards are increasingly higher , @entity5 schools could already be at that level
