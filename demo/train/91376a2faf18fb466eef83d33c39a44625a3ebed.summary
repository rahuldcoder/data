-- a common view is that @entity3 politics have gone into shutdown , that the whole system can no longer function and deliver the kind of government that @entity3 want and need			1
that 's certainly the opinion in my native @entity12 , where i 'm regularly told the @entity3 -- particularly the @entity14 -- has been gripped by a kind of madness			1
the current crisis is certainly traumatic for those involved and bodes badly for the next round of debt ceiling negotiations			1
but it 's not historically unique or a symbol of conservative insanity			2
@entity24 has gone through shutdowns before			2
@entity26 notes in @entity27 that the @entity3 government has shut down 17 times since 1976			1
the vast majority of those shutdowns happened when the @entity32 controlled the @entity33			1
they happened under @entity35 over abortion policy ( remember when that divided the @entity32 ? ) and under @entity38 , mostly about budget priorities -- including efforts to nix @entity38 's pet projects ( sound familiar ? )			2
during the 21 - day face - off between @entity44 and @entity45 , unemployment fell slightly and @entity3 emerged with a welfare reform deal			1
those shutdowns remind us that @entity3 politics have always been partisan and rancorous -- as the two - party system was established with the intention of being			1
honest , heated debate is part of being a democratic nation			1
before the 1960s , progressive legislation in the @entity33 was constantly stonewalled by coalition of @entity32 and conservative @entity14 -- a bloc that it took a civil rights revolution to undo			0
in the 1940s , @entity60 found his legislation blocked by a " do - nothing " @entity63 of @entity14 ( although that @entity63 still got a lot done )			0
of course , in the 19th century , partisan divisions reflected the battle lines of a bloody civil war			0
@entity69 's superhuman effort to get a ban on slavery through @entity63 testifies to the timelessness of the battle between executive and legislature			2
and @entity63 in recent decades has rarely been popular			0
true , today a shockingly low 10 % of the population approves of its performance			2
but its rating never exceeded 40 % throughout the 1970s and 1980s and sunk to 20 % in 1979 and 1992			0
today , no one is denying that we find ourselves in an almighty mess with the potential for disaster as the clock ticks toward default			2
but there 's logic to the arguments of everyone involved			0
@entity92 and the @entity93 refuse to give up on @entity94 , especially since the president 's re-election			0
@entity97 is indeed being held hostage by members of his @entity14 caucus , but those tea partiers have a right to argue that the polls show @entity94 is unpopular , that they have evidence it will threaten the economic recovery , that they can use their sway in the @entity33 to say how the money should be spent , and that they are pursuing a valid constitutional strategy to get what they want			0
the polls also show that the shutdown is bad politics , and that the public blames the @entity14 for it			1
but would we rather the @entity33 do exactly as the president tells it to and not follow its conscience on the vital subjects of health care and finance ? @entity3 is not @entity12 , where a party 's control of one aspect of government ( the @entity33 ) effectively guarantees control over the entire system			1
the @entity3 way has the potential for divided government built into it , precisely because its founders wanted to protect against the growth of the state and to keep it in check by making it hard to pursue utopian manifestoes through to their glorious end			1
passing lots of laws and spending lots of money ought to be a difficult , complex business			0
but for anyone dreaming of a government so hamstrung that it ca n't do anything at all , i have some sad news to impart			0
the @entity154 has stopped sending out refunds but is still collecting money			0
join us @entity159 / @entity158			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			1

@entity162 : many think @entity3 politics gripped by madness on shutdown , but it 's not so
he says @entity172 *congresses* *responsible* for majority of shutdowns in the past
he says current debate is part of democracy , and the positions of all parties today are logical
@entity162 : @entity3 founders built serious checks into system , and it 's supposed to be complex
