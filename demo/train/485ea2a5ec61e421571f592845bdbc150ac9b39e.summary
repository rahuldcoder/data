-- relief teams dug through rose gardens at the headquarters of the @entity4 , looking for more than 70 army officers still missing -- and presumed killed -- after a deadly uprising by paramilitary forces last week			1
@entity9 firefighters continued to uncover bodies friday of @entity4 officers from a mass grave			1
by late saturday night , 72 bodies had been found floating in a river or in three mass graves inside the compound of the @entity4 , or @entity18 , in the capital city , @entity20 , the @entity13 said			1
fifty of the dead were confirmed to be army officers , shot or stabbed to death			1
another six were @entity4 troops , or jawans			1
the rest of the bodies were too damaged for immediate identification , the ministry said			1
but four days since the rebellion , grieving family members keeping vigil outside the headquarters were losing hope of seeing their loved ones alive again			2
some men quietly recited verses from the quran , @entity40 's holy book , or counted prayer beads			0
several women howled in despair and collapsed hopelessly on the pavement			0
sympathy for the mutineers has dried up , a @entity9 journalist said			0
" the first day of the incident , @entity9 were for the @entity18			0
they thought they had legitimate concerns of army officer corruption and denial of basic necessities to them , " said @entity49 , host of the television show , " @entity51			2
" " but from the second day , when we started getting news of missing officers and seeing pictures of one body after another being pulled out , the perception changed , " he said			1
one can see the shift in the media coverage of the mutiny , he said			2
" what was being called @entity70 revolt or rebellion " -- named after the area of the city where the @entity18 compounds are located -- " is now being dubbed the @entity70 massacre			0
" prime minister @entity76 initially earned high marks for persuading the jawans to surrender in exchange for amnesty			0
but now she finds herself in a delicate balancing act : trying to appease an army that demands the killers , who stubbed out the lives of so many of its officers , be punished			1
she met for hours sunday with the army 's top officials , and made several concessions			2
a committee the @entity13 set up to investigate the mutiny will be shuffled to include more members from the army 's ranks			1
she has also backtracked from her promise of amnesty			0
killers will face trial , she said , and ordered jawans to return to their posts or report to police stations by the end of the day sunday			0
hundreds of jawans lined up at a field outside the @entity70 headquarters , insisting to reporters they fled the compound during the rebellion			1
they kissed their loved ones as they waited , assuring wives and fathers they were innocent but asking for their prayers			0
the fear of a military take - over is a pervasive one in @entity9			0
the country has experienced a series of coup since its independence in 1971 , including one that killed @entity76 's father -- the country 's independence leader			0
the current government itself came to power in december , after two years of an army - backed rule			2
" @entity76 has her responsibility to keep peace and tranquility and so she did what she did , " said @entity128 , a student who lives not far from the @entity18 headquarters			2
" and you ca n't fault the army from reacting			2
they lost so many people			0
" the military did its part to allay fears of retaliation			0
" i believe if exemplary punishment is meted out to the people involved directly or indirectly in the mutiny , it will help pacify the anger among our officers and soldiers , " brig			1
the standoff started wednesday when @entity18 troops rebelled against their commanders			1
the @entity18 is a paramilitary force distinct from the army , but its commanders are career army officers			1
the @entity4 is responsible primarily for guarding the country 's borders			1
the force , more than 65,000 - strong , also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls			0
the troops staged their rebellion on the second day of @entity167 , when officers and troops from various @entity18 outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations			1
@entity174 had been bubbling for years in the ranks of the @entity18 , who complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay , subsidized food and their requests to participate in @entity183 peacekeeping operations -- which pay far more than what they make at home			2
@entity9 and its @entity188 neighbors are the largest troop contributors to @entity183 peacekeeping operations			0
during the stand - off , dozens of officers were killed			0
some bodies were dumped in mass graves			1
others were tossed in sewers that emptied into the @entity197 , where they floated for miles before being retrieved .			0
