-- researchers are developing a specialized skin " printing " system that could be used in the future to treat soldiers wounded on the battlefield			2
scientists at the @entity9 were inspired by standard inkjet printers found in many home offices			1
" we started out by taking a typical desktop inkjet cartridge			2
instead of ink we use cells , which are placed in the cartridge , " said dr. @entity13 , director of the institute			1
the device could be used to rebuild damaged or burned skin			2
the project is in pre-clinical phases and may take another five years of development before it is ready to be used on human burn victims , he said			1
other universities , including @entity25 and the @entity26 , @entity27 , are working on similar projects and will speak on the topic on sunday at the @entity31 conference in @entity32			0
these university researchers say organs -- not just skin -- could be printed using similar techniques			0
burn injuries account for 5 % to 20 % of combat - related injuries , according to the @entity39			0
the skin printing project is one of several projects at @entity9 largely funded by that institute , which is a branch of the @entity45 @entity44			1
@entity9 will receive approximately $ 50 million from the @entity44 over the next five years to fund projects , including the skin - creating system			1
researchers developed the skin " bio-printer " by modifying a standard store - bought printer			2
one modification is the addition of a three - dimensional " elevator " that builds on damaged tissue with fresh layers of healthy skin			0
the skin - printing process involves several steps			0
first , a small piece of skin is taken from the patient			0
the sample is about half the size of a postage stamp , and it is taken from the patient by using a chemical solution			0
those cells are then separated and replicated on their own in a specialized environment that catalyzes this cell development			2
" we expand the cells in large quantities			0
once we make those new cells , the next step is to put the cells in the printer , on a cartridge , and print on the patient , " @entity13 said			1
the printer is then placed over the wound at a distance so that it does n't touch the burn victim			0
" it 's like a flat - bed scanner that moves back and forth and put cells on you , " said @entity13			1
once the new cells have been applied , they mature and form new skin			2
specially designed printer heads in the skin bio-printer use pressurized nozzles -- unlike those found in traditional inkjet printers			1
the pressure - based delivery system allows for a safe distance between the printer and the patient and can accommodate a variety of body types , according to a 2010 report from the @entity39			0
the device can fabricate healthy skin in anywhere from minutes to a few hours , depending on the size and type of burn , according to the report			0
" you are building up the cells layer after layer after layer , " @entity13 said			1
acquiring an adequate sample can be a challenge in victims with extensive burns , he said , since there is sometimes " not enough ( skin ) to go around with a patient with large burns , " @entity13 said			1
the sample biopsy would be used to grow new cells then placed in the printer cartridge , said @entity13			1
researchers said it is difficult to speculate when the skin printer may be brought to the battlefield , because of the stringent regulatory steps for a project of this nature			1
once the skin - printing device meets federal regulations , military officials are optimistic it will benefit the general population as well as soldiers			0
" we 're not making anything military - unique , " said @entity140 , a program director at the @entity141			0
" we hope it will benefit both soldier and civilian , " he said			0
in the meantime , researchers said they 're pleased with results of preliminary laboratory testing with the skin printer			2
@entity13 said the researchers already have been able to make " healthy skin			1

scientists used a modified inkjet printer *loaded* with living cells
" we are engineering human skin , " says dr. @entity13
the project may take another five years of development before it is ready
