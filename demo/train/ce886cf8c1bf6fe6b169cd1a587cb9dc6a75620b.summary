" things are sort of buzzing down here right now , and it feels good , " said @entity10 , a local businessman who owns three hotels in the @entity12			0
" did n't know what to expect this year , but it appears that interest is high and people are acting on that decision in order to make @entity22 part of their travel plans			2
" hotel bookings are on pace with last year , and the city is anticipating between 700,000 and 800,000 @entity28 visitors this year -- at least as many as 2008			1
some tourism officials and business owners expect this year 's attendance to top last year 's numbers because @entity33 , on february 24 this year , falls nearly three weeks later , giving visitors more time to plan and budget for the trip after the winter holidays			1

typically the early , smaller - scale parades do n't draw much attention , he said			0
" it just appears that people feel the need to relax and celebrate , and @entity28 is an opportunity to step back from what they 're dealing with every day and spend a little time in a mellower , less threatening , more carefree type of an environment			1
" despite high expectations for @entity28 , the city 's tourism industry has n't completely dodged the economic downturn			1
@entity10 has seen a dip in corporate and meeting inquiries at his hotels and less interest from leisure travelers during times that do n't surround special events			0
still , visitation levels for the first quarter of 2009 have remained strong , according to the @entity79 , which spokeswoman @entity80 attributes to meetings and conventions , @entity28 and marketing efforts to promote the city as a value destination compared with other popular @entity87 cities			1
@entity4 ' sparkling culinary reputation is part of its unique draw , and @entity91 , an @entity93 restaurant away from the throngs of revelers in the @entity12 , is looking forward to a strong weekend			0
by thursday afternoon , the 60 - seat restaurant had 90 people on the books for saturday night			1
