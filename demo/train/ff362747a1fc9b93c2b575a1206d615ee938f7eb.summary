-- with @entity3 by his side , @entity1 opened his grand slam tennis account , won an @entity6 gold and ended @entity8 's nearly 80 - year wait for a men 's singles champion at @entity10			1
when he triumphed at the @entity11 last july , @entity3 , not @entity1 's influential mom , @entity13 , was the first person he hugged as he climbed into the players ' box			1
the knowledge @entity3 amassed in winning eight grand slams himself was passed on to @entity1 and the two -- who share dry sense of humors and like to keep low profiles -- forged a strong bond			1
@entity1 thanked @entity3 for pulling no punches when discussing his game , which , as good as it was , had yet to yield a major as he competed with the talented trio of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
but on wednesday , @entity3 became the latest coach to cut ties with @entity1			1
it 's another blow to the @entity36 , who has struggled to rediscover his best form following back surgery only months after that once - in - a - lifetime occasion at @entity10			1
" working with @entity1 over the last two years has been a fantastic experience for me , " @entity3 said in a statement			1
" he is a first class guy			0
" having helped him achieve his goal of winning major titles , i feel like it is time for me to concentrate on some of my own projects moving forward , including playing more events around the world which i am really enjoying			1
" i will always be in @entity1 's corner and wish him nothing but great success as he , too , goes into a new phase of his career			1
" @entity1 , meanwhile , had nothing but praise for @entity3			1
" i 'm eternally grateful to @entity3 for all his hard work over the past two years , the most successful of my career so far , " @entity1 said in the statement			1
" as a team , we 've learned a lot and it will definitely be of benefit in the future			0
" i 'll take some time with the team to consider the next steps and how we progress from here			2
" @entity3 played senior and exhibition events in the period he was coaching @entity1 , and runs an academy in @entity71			1
he was hired at the end of 2011 , following the likes of @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , and @entity1 won singles gold at @entity79 and captured the @entity80 a month later			1
@entity3 's arrival paved the way for other retired greats to return as coaches , with @entity85 now alongside @entity32 and @entity86 teaming up with @entity30			2
in an email to @entity0 , @entity3 -- a man of little words in public -- said there was no deeper issue to the partnership concluding			1
" it 's very simple -- i could not commit enough time to do the job properly , " wrote the father of five girls			0
indeed , according to @entity1 's former @entity101 captain , all appeared to be going well			2
" the relationship is very sound , they really enjoy each other 's company , @entity3 is a fantastic coach and @entity1 is a world - class tennis player , " @entity102 told @entity0			1
" so it 's a shame to me that this has happened , but you have to respect @entity3 's reasons for doing so			2
" he 's in demand to do so many different things , and i guess he feels it 's time to move on in that regard			0
@entity1 has learned so much in the last couple of years and @entity3 has to be a bit selfish in a decision like this , but he also has @entity1 's best interests at heart as well			1
" to me they would n't split up for another reason , a tennis reason , or a compatibility issue			0
they would just be spitting up for the time commitment reason			0
" nonetheless , the news stunned the tennis world , with @entity75 saying he was " surprised as heck			0
" he described @entity1 as a " genius but complicated			2
" it came as @entity1 prepares to defend his title in @entity132 , the city he uses as a training base			2
@entity3 is a @entity134 resident			2
" i got up at six , saw a tweet and i was like , ' wow , ' " @entity75 told @entity0			0
" i 've been inundated on @entity136 and everyone wants to know why it happened			0
i 'm just as surprised as anyone that the partnership has ended			0
" it 's an unusual time , right before @entity132			0
i did n't hear that anything was coming			0
it just shows you how fragile the coaching - player partnership can be			2
" @entity1 , who has dropped from second in the rankings in july to sixth , has yet to win a title in 2014 and is coming off losses in @entity150 and @entity151 to lower - ranked opposition after claiming the opening set			1
@entity102 , though , is n't alarmed			0
" he 's coming back from a pretty significant surgery to a very delicate part of the body , " said @entity102 , a former top 60 player			2
" i 've been saying for months now -- and i had a lot of surgery myself -- mentally , you just do n't recover from those things instantly			0
" it takes you a long time to regain all that confidence in your body and so i 'm not surprised that it 's taking him a while to get up to speed			0
we might not see it in the next six months			0
who knows when he 's going to feel completely comfortable again			0
" if ( 100 - meter world - record holder ) @entity171 pulls a calf muscle , he does n't all of a sudden run 9.50 seconds in his first race			0

@entity1 ends his successful partnership with coach @entity3
under @entity3 , @entity1 won his lone two grand slam singles titles
@entity1 says he is " eternally grateful " to the eight - time grand slam champion
@entity1 has struggled in 2014 after *undergoing* back surgery last fall
