@entity0 , @entity1 -- two weeks after a police - involved shooting sparked violent protests in a @entity8 suburb , the mood turned more tranquil saturday with smaller crowds and lots of music			1
gone were police in riot gear glaring at defiant protesters			1
the tear gas , rubber bullets and @entity18 cocktails were nowhere to be seen , either			1
in their place were clusters of officers , hanging around businesses , chatting with one another			1
shops reopened by late friday and residents gathered for ribs at a local barbecue restaurant boarded up with plywood , a visible reminder of the violent protests and looting just a few days ago			1
a van rolled down the streets with men grilling hot dogs in the back and handing them out to passersby			1
amid the vibrant noise of a heartbroken city slowly coming back to life , a preacher hollered , " @entity46 ! " as a choir on a flatbed belted out hymns , leaving pauses for his exaltation			1
the change in mood comes two weeks to the day after @entity0 police officer @entity49 fatally shot @entity50 , an unarmed 18 - year - old			1
protesters have taken to the streets daily in the mostly black city , sometimes clashing violently with officers			1
hundreds of people walked the streets later saturday in a march in @entity50 's memory , organized by the @entity58			1
despite the calm , slivers of earlier tension hovered			1
a vendor sold t - shirts adorned with the words , " it 's time to start the healing " as a small group marched down the streets chanting , " hands up ! do n't shoot ! " and " no justice , no peace			1
" 2 - year - old protester before calling it a night on friday , @entity72 , 49 , of nearby @entity73 , made one last march along the protest route with her grandson , @entity77 , 2			1
the toddler carried a sign that read , " you do n't have to shoot			2
" @entity72 has been to the protests daily since @entity50 was killed			2
this was the second time she 'd brought @entity77			1
" he might not understand why i 'm out here , but i 'm out here for him , " she said			2
" one day he 'll read about this movement , and he 'll know he made this change right along with his granny			1
i want to make things better for my grandson			2
i want things to change			2
... i really do n't want my grandson to be another @entity92			2
" race has been at the forefront of the tensions ; @entity50 was @entity96 and the officer who shot him is white			2
@entity8 authorities friday released details of the racial and gender makeup of the grand jury handling the case			2
it comprises six white men , three white women , two black women and one black man , said @entity109 , the administrator for the @entity110			0
@entity8 is 70 % white and 24 % black , according to last year 's estimate by the @entity112			0
@entity113 orders review of military equipment to police state and federal cases the release of the details of the jury comes amid a key complaint among @entity50 family supporters , who 've said the man whose office is tasked with making the case to the grand jury -- @entity8 prosecuting attorney @entity128 -- is too cozy with law enforcement			0
protesters have said he does not have a good relationship with the @entity96 - @entity96 community and should be replaced			0

crucial grand jury unlike a jury in a criminal case , which convicts someone if jurors are convinced of guilt " beyond a reasonable doubt , " a grand jury decides if there is " probable cause			0
" they decide whether to charge someone with a crime based on testimony and evidence presented in the absence of a judge			0
in @entity1 , they do n't have to be unanimous to press such an indictment , as long as nine of the 12 agree on a charge			0
the federal government is conducting a separate investigation			0
@entity157 agents have knocked on more than 400 doors in @entity0 and interviewed more than 200 people as part of the @entity162 's civil rights investigation , according to law enforcement sources			0
the federal probe must prove there was an element of " racial hostility " in the shooting			0
that 's a higher standard than the one before the @entity8 grand jury			0
the 12 members of the grand jury are crucial			0
they may be the first to reach a decision on whether the case will be defined as a murder charge , a lesser charge or no charge at all			0
