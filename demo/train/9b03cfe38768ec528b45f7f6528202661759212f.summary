@entity0 -- it is 6am and @entity3 is surveying the preparations for the 100th anniversary of the @entity6			1
a team of 800 people has spent three weeks converting 11 acres of playing fields into the world 's most prestigious horticulture show , as famous for attracting royalty and celebrities as garden enthusiasts			1
over five days each may , 157,000 visitors troop into the @entity17 in west @entity0 to see 550 exhibitors displaying magnificent show gardens , new plants and new trends in gardening			1
watch : royal visit to flower show after 30 years in the travel industry , @entity25 became director general of the @entity28 -- the charity behind @entity6 -- in 2010 , and has already attracted a record number of members to the organization			1
" i was here at 6 o'clock this morning and the excitement is fantastic , " says @entity25			0
" there 's something very magical about @entity17			1
if you love gardening , as i have since i was seven years old , @entity17 is the absolute pinnacle			2
i have to pinch myself that i 'm seeing it take shape			0
" this has been going on for 100 years , you are very aware of the heritage , the past that 's gone before and the great people who have walked this showground , whether royalty , celebrities or great gardeners			1
" whether you love the tiny detail of a plant or the great vistas of an elaborate garden , there 's always something you 'll find eye - wateringly beautiful			2
" @entity6 takes between 15 and 18 months to prepare , so even as the final touches are being added to this year , a team is well into planning for the 2014 show			1
extravagant displays at @entity17 in the past two years have included an 80ft " @entity59 " and a " @entity60 " with a suspended " flying boat " , both by the @entity63 garden designer and television personality @entity62			0
this year @entity62 is not exhibiting , and @entity25 says the focus is more on plantmanship , although she has promised at least one surprise			2
@entity25 , 57 , began gardening at the age of seven when her mother gave her a packet of seeds and her own piece of garden for her birthday			2
" i was smitten the minute the seeds came into flower , " she says			0
" it takes you into another world , an oasis , it 's a great wind - down for me			2
" however , she was not trained in horticulture and had never worked in the industry until three years ago			0
instead , @entity25 went into the travel industry where she worked for 25 years for the upmarket operator @entity86 , rising to become managing director			0
in 1999 , when she joined the board of @entity86 , she became the youngest ever director , the first female director and the first @entity92 director			0
" i went to @entity94 for a celebratory weekend with the board , and they presented me with a card saying ' @entity98 , finally we have someone to iron our shirts '			0
they 'd be shot for that now , but at the time i found it funny			0
" @entity25 , a longtime member of the @entity28 , became its director general in 2010 after her husband spotted an advertisement in a sunday newspaper and suggested a change of career			1
" i laughed at him at first , but he said ' you love gardening , you 'd love it , ' she says			2
" i decided to apply and by some miracle they chose me			0
" @entity25 has worked on ridding the 209 - year - old society of its exclusive image , promoting its charity work and has pushed membership numbers over 400,000 for the first time			1
" it was never intentional , but it was seen as a gardening club for posh people			1
we have tried to be much more open and engage people			2
it 's helped us to achieve a record number of members , " she says			0
she has overseen the sale of one of the society 's properties in @entity0 and used the money to invest in charity work , from promoting horticulture as a career option and funding plant research to opening an urban garden			1
" it 's one of my frustrations that people do n't know the @entity28 is a charity , " she says			1
" we need to make people aware of the scientific research , the work in schools , prisons and communities that we do			1
all of that work is funded by the success of shows like @entity17			0
" back at @entity17 , @entity25 is preparing for another busy day from media interviews to overseeing the start of planting once all the structures , from pavilions and marquees to rocks , boulders and hedges are in place			0
she is wary of treading a fine line between tradition and innovation			0
" @entity17 is the most successful flower show in the world , but it needs to always have something to surprise and delight people			0
" @entity6 runs from may 21 - 25 at the @entity17 , @entity0 .			1

@entity3 became head of @entity28 in 2010
she has tried to change the image from " gardening club for posh people " to promote the society 's charity work
