-- in just a few years , digital video has overtaken film - based shooting by an overwhelming margin			1
but in the interest of staving off premature extinction , a group of directors have banded together to keep the @entity9 making movie film			1
the @entity11 reports that a group of directors , led by the likes of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 ( who is filming @entity18 on film ) pushed studio heads into negotiations with the film company			1
these discussions , which the @entity11 broke the lid on , revolve around promises to buy a set quantity of film for the next several years , regardless of whether they plan to use all of it			0
@entity9 's motion - picture film sales have fallen 96 percent since 2006 , from 12.4 billion linear feet to an estimated 449 million			1
left the business last year , and @entity9 is the only major company left producing the product			2
the company 's chief executive , @entity33 , told the @entity11 that @entity9 initially hoped to enlist studios in a joint venture on its @entity39 , @entity38 , plant , but that proposal failed			2
the second solution , involving the purchase of mass quantities of film , became the consensus after filmmakers started to join the discussion ( and personally lobby executives )			0
@entity14 , for instance , appealed to @entity50 , co-chairman of @entity51 " it 's a financial commitment , no doubt about it , " @entity50 told the @entity11 , " but i do n't think we could look some of our filmmakers in the eyes if we did n't do it			1
" @entity50 's claims are supported by comments from other directors			0
@entity16 told the newspaper that both film and digital video are " valid choices " but " there 's a magic to the grain and the color quality that you get with film			1
" in a separate interview , @entity17 argued that " film sets the standard and once it 's no longer available , the ability to shoot the benchmark goes away			0
suddenly you 're left with what is , in many cases , perfectly good but not necessarily the best , the warmest , the most rich and detailed images			0
" in negotiations with @entity9 , @entity51 is joined by @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82			2
