-- days after the world of athletics was hit by serious doping allegations , the sport has been accused of covering up how it dealt with scores of suspicious blood samples			1
in the two years between 2006 and 2008 , the body in charge of global athletics failed to examine as many as 150 samples from several countries , according to a report broadcast by a @entity15 network monday			1
this was a period before widespread changes were introduced to anti-doping procedures			0
the allegations reported by @entity15 tv station @entity20 came less than a week after @entity15 broadcaster @entity22 / @entity21 aired an hour - long programme documenting @entity26 's alleged endemic use of banned substances			1
as with last week 's documentary , @entity20 released an @entity30 transcript after airing the report			2
the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) is now investigating those claims , but the governing body now finds itself under the microscope			1
during monday 's edition of the " @entity37 , " a former member of the @entity32 's medical commission -- who is not identified -- said the samples in question were from athletes representing @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity15 , @entity47 , @entity26 and at least one from @entity48			1
" just take a look the haemoglobin values -- how they have risen in only four months by 38 % and in the next four months they have fallen again by 16 % " , the official explains , according to the @entity30 translation of the documentary provided by the broadcaster to @entity0			0
" it 's obvious that there 's something wrong there			0
that simply can not be			0
it is absolutely clear to see and physiologically simply can not be explained			0
this can only be doping			0
" president of @entity44 's athletics federation @entity64 said his organization received no notification of any suspicious samples from the @entity32			1
" when we receive information of that type , we immediately carry out surprise doping tests on the suspicious athletes , " @entity64 said in an email sent to @entity0			0
he also outlined that @entity44 track athletes are required to supply their " blood passport " -- a method used to monitor any potential doping violations -- a week before competition			0
both @entity81 and @entity82 have declined to comment , while both the @entity83 and @entity84 have so far failed to reply to @entity0 's request for comment			0
the @entity32 insisted tuesday that the @entity30 transcript of the documentary would be passed on directly to its independent ethics commission			1
it also said that " a member of the @entity91 would not know whether follow - up tests would have been conducted or not			2
" the athlete biological passport program was launched in 2009 , ensuring athlete 's blood samples were stored electronically and monitored over time , according to the @entity32			1
samples collected prior to 2009 , according to the @entity32 , " do not have the same level of reliability and strength as the post- 2009 values which were collected under strict and stringent conditions			1
" the governing body also stated that any samples taken before 2009 were only used as " secondary evidence , " or to arrange " trigger " follow - up urine tests			2
the @entity32 also insists that " abnormal results were duly followed - up by the @entity32 , whenever possible logistically			2
" @entity108 , the world 's anti-doping agency , said it would investigate the allegations in a statement released on tuesday			0
last week 's " @entity113 " documentary had already alleged systematic doping in @entity26 athletics			2
it claimed @entity26 officials covered up positive results in exchange for financial reward			0
the @entity84 ( @entity121 , ) announced it would investigate the allegations , while the president of the country 's athletics federation told @entity126 the claims were " a pack of lies			1
