@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 does not know whether to refer to herself as a wife ... or a widow			1
she and her four children have been in limbo ever since august 29 , the last day she saw her husband in the flesh			0
" my eldest son sometimes opens up the computer , puts up his father 's photo and starts crying , " @entity3 said			0
" not a day goes by without my youngest son asking me ' when is daddy coming home ? ' " until he went missing from a refugee camp in @entity1 last august , @entity3 's husband , @entity21 army lieutenant colonel @entity19 , was the self - styled leader of a rebellion of mutinous soldiers against the @entity21 government known as the " @entity26			1
" the sensitivity of @entity19 's case was plainly evident during @entity3 's first interview with a journalist since the disappearance of her husband			1
police at the makeshift camp where her family lives insisted that a plain - clothed @entity1 police officer accompany @entity3 during an hour - long interview with @entity2			2
the officer was assigned " for her protection , " authorities said			0
he did not interfere with the interview and remained out of earshot for the duration of the discussion			0
@entity19 first attracted international attention last june , when he made an online video calling on other @entity21 soldiers to desert and join an anti-government group he labeled the " @entity26			1
" he was one of the first @entity21 military officers to publicly break with the regime			1
judging by the number of similar videos that started cropping up on the internet , it appeared @entity19 's rebellion was growing			1
again and again , uniformed soldiers and officers faced the camera , held up their identity cards as proof , and then denounced the @entity21 regime 's deadly crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators			1
@entity19 claimed to lead this movement from exile in neighboring @entity1			1
@entity19 , his wife and four children lived in a compound of empty warehouses the @entity1 government converted into a makeshift refugee camp in the @entity1 border town of @entity0			1
@entity19 regularly met with opposition activists and journalists there , until august 29			1
that morning , @entity3 said her husband walked out of the gates of the camp , which are protected by @entity1 police			0
soon after , she said he disappeared and his phone stopped answering calls			0
" from that moment , i was certain my husband was handed back to the @entity21 , " @entity3 recalled			1
after going missing for more than two weeks , @entity19 suddenly resurfaced ... this time in a " confession " aired on @entity21 's strictly - controlled state television network			1
in the september 15 broadcast , @entity19 recanted his support for the opposition			1
he denied ever receiving orders from commanding officers to open fire on demonstrators			0
and he accused the opposition @entity92 of smuggling weapons and terrorists to @entity21			1
@entity19 has not been seen or heard from since			1
@entity3 believes he is now in @entity21 custody			1
" i ca n't live in a fantasy and pretend as if i 'm blind or deaf and say it 's not true , " she said			0
it is still a mystery how @entity19 disappeared from the gates of a police - protected @entity1 refugee camp and ended up on @entity21 state television			1
@entity3 and some other opposition activists blame the @entity1 government			1
" i talked to him [ @entity19 ] on the morning of august 29th , " said exiled @entity21 activist @entity106 , in an interview with @entity2 on september 16			1
" he said ' i have a meeting with a @entity1 security man			0
when i finish i will call you			0
' i waited for three days and did n't hear from him			0
" @entity3 also said her husband left the camp on august 29 planning on meeting with a mysterious man camp residents believed was a @entity1 intelligence officer			0
" maybe he 's not an intelligence officer as he claimed , but he 's one of the @entity1 , " @entity3 said			0
" we do n't know his rank or who the guy is exactly , but over the phone he introduced himself as @entity123			0
" @entity3 accused @entity1 authorities of handing the rebel officer over to the @entity21			2
" i believe they arrested him as part of an agreement between the two countries , " @entity3 said			0
the @entity1 government has repeatedly denied such accusations			2
@entity1 officials also denied any knowledge of the alleged intelligence officer refugee camp residents knew as " @entity123 , " which is a generic @entity136 nick - name that means " father of @entity123			2
" @entity138 officially states that it welcomes all @entity21 on @entity1 territory			2
@entity1 officials pointed to the more than 7,500 @entity21 refugees that have been fed , clothed and housed for months at a network of government - run camps along the border			1
relations between the two neighbors have grown increasingly frosty			0
@entity138 has hosted several @entity21 opposition meetings			1
@entity1 leaders have also threatened to punish the @entity21 government 's ongoing violence against its citizens with sanctions			1
but in @entity154 , the @entity1 border province where @entity19 disappeared , there is strong local support for @entity21 president @entity156			1
the region is home to a large number of ethnic @entity160 from the same @entity162 sect as @entity156 , whose family and clan have ruled @entity21 for more than 40 years			2
portraits of the @entity21 president sell in @entity1 souvenir shops			2
it is not uncommon to hear locals cursing @entity21 anti-government demonstrators			2
@entity3 said her husband 's revolt against @entity173 , was fueled partially by the perception that the army 's dominant @entity162 officer corps discriminated against @entity19 because he was from @entity21 's majority @entity179 sect			1
" because he was @entity179 , they stopped promoting him			0
they treated him badly , " @entity3 said			0
in interviews with @entity2 , other @entity179 officers who joined the " @entity26 " also complained bitterly about discrimination at the hands of senior @entity162 commanders in the @entity21 military			2
meanwhile , efforts to track down the missing leader of the " @entity26 " have proven fruitless			0
when @entity3 asked for the help of a lawyer , she said local @entity1 officials demanded she first provide documentary evidence that she was in fact married to @entity19			2
those are documents @entity3 can not provide			0
" we left the country without passports , " @entity3 said			0
" according to @entity21 law , officers in the @entity21 military can not provide passports to their wife and family			1
so we do n't have passports			0
" visibly distraught , @entity3 now finds herself caught in legal limbo between two countries			0
she said she felt her children were not safe , living in a camp close to the porous border with @entity21			2
after an hour - long conversation , it was clear she did not know whether she should begin mourning for her missing husband			0
when asked whether she had a message for @entity19 , @entity3 thought for a moment			2
" if he is still alive , i urge him to be patient , " she finally said , adding : " but i do n't think anyone can survive the torture and dungeons of the @entity21 secret service			2
if he 's dead , that means he 's in paradise			0
" @entity2 's @entity223 contributed to this report			0

@entity19 was the self - styled leader of a rebellion of mutinous soldiers against the @entity21 government
he was last seen in september on @entity21 television
in that appearance he recanted his support for the opposition
his wife says she does not know if she is a wife or a widow
