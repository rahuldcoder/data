-- public schools in @entity2 , @entity3 , face millions of dollars in penalties after a ruling that the district 's @entity6 violates state law			1
an administrative law judge found the program 's curriculum was teaching @entity13 history and culture " in a biased , political , and emotionally charged manner , " and upheld state officials ' findings that it violated a state law passed in 2010			1
the @entity20 had appealed a decision by the law 's principal backer , then - state schools superintendent @entity24 , to shut down the program			2
@entity24 left office at the end of 2010 , but his successor , @entity29 , backed @entity24 's ruling in june			0
@entity29 said tuesday 's ruling shows " that it was the right decision			0
" " in the end , i made a decision based on the totality of the information and facts gathered during my investigation -- a decision that i felt was best for all students in the @entity20 , " he said in a written statement			0
under the law , the state can withhold 10 % of its funding for the school district -- about $ 15 million a year -- until the district changes the course			1
in a written statement , @entity2 superintendent @entity46 said the school board 's lawyers are reviewing the ruling , and board members will discuss it at their january 3 meeting			2
during their appeal , district officials pointed out that an audit commissioned by @entity29 praised the program and found " no observable evidence " that the classes violated state law			1
a witness for the school system argued that teaching students " historical facts of oppression and racism " was less likely to promote " racial resentment " -- something specifically banned by the 2010 law -- than ignoring that history			1
in tuesday 's ruling , administrative law judge @entity70 said the auditors observed only a limited number of classes			2
he added , " teaching oppression objectively is quite different than actively presenting material in a biased , political , and emotionally charged manner			1
" " teaching in such a manner promotes social or political activism against the white people , promotes racial resentment , and advocates ethnic solidarity , instead of treating pupils as individuals , " @entity70 wrote			1
he cited a lesson that taught students that the historic treatment of @entity91 was " marked by the use of force , fraud and exploitation , " and a parent 's complaint that one of her daughters , who was white , was shunned by @entity13 classmates after a government course was taught " in an extremely biased manner			0
" the 2010 law also bans courses that " promote the overthrow of the @entity107 government , " are " designed for a specific ethnic group " or advocate " ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals			1
" it was passed in the same session of the state legislature that produced @entity3 's controversial law cracking down on illegal immigration			2
a group of teachers has asked a federal court to throw out the restrictions , arguing they passed as " a result of racial bias and anti-hispanic beliefs and sentiments			0
" @entity121 , the lawyer who represents the teachers in that case , said the decision was expected " under the circumstances			0
" " the law was written in a way that allows the superintendent of public instruction to control the outcome , " @entity121 told @entity0			0
and @entity70 noted that he was working under the assumption that the law is constitutional , " ignoring any questions raised " to the contrary , @entity121 said .			0

courses were " biased , political , and emotionally charged , " a state official rules
the finding could cost @entity2 schools $ 15 million a year
a 2010 @entity3 law bars classes that promote " racial resentment " or " ethnic solidarity "
an earlier audit found the classes did *n't* violate that law
