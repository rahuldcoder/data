@entity0 -- if at first you do n't succeed , try to change the rules			0
a proposal under consideration in @entity8 's @entity7 - led state legislature would change how the commonwealth allocates its 13 electoral votes in the wake of @entity14 president @entity13 's re-election last november			1
@entity13 won the popular vote in the crucial battleground state to claim all 13 electoral votes , even though @entity7 challenger @entity18 beat him in seven of the 11 congressional districts			1
under the proposed alternative system , electoral votes would get divvied up by congressional districts won			1
in addition , @entity8 's two other electoral votes -- one for each @entity25 seat -- would go to the candidate who won the most congressional districts			1
if the district - based system had been in effect in @entity8 last year , @entity18 would have gotten nine electoral votes to four for @entity13			1
@entity32 urges @entity7 to stop being ' stupid ' while a subcommittee has advanced the @entity8 proposal , skepticism expressed by some @entity7 state senators raised doubts that it would proceed any further			1
gov. @entity38 , a @entity7 , does not support the plan , according to his spokesman			2
" he believes @entity8 's existing system works just fine as it is			2
he does not believe there is any need for a change , " @entity42 said in statement			0
however , @entity47 , newly re-elected chairman of the @entity48 , called the idea worth examining			0
" i think it is a state issue , but personally i 'm pretty intrigued by it , " he told @entity50			0
opinion : where the stupidity really lies the state party chairman in @entity57 , @entity56 , questioned the wisdom of such a move at a time when the party is trying to broaden its support			2
" it seems to me we ought to be focused on connecting with voters and bringing them into our party versus trying to change the game , " @entity56 said			0
to @entity69 , the senior elections analyst at @entity70 , the concept does n't violate democratic principles , but he called it a bad idea			0
" close elections would likely always result in extensive recounts , we could see huge disparities between the popular and electoral vote , and the partisan motive behind it would be transparent , " he wrote friday on the group 's website			0
currently , only @entity82 and @entity83 use a district - based plan for allocating electoral votes			2
their systems differ from the @entity8 proposal by awarding the two additional electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote , rather than who won the most districts			1
last year , both split their electoral votes between @entity13 and @entity18			1
other @entity7 - controlled state legislatures reportedly contemplating changes to their electoral vote allocation include @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			1
under the @entity104 system , each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population			1
winning the presidency requires a majority of the electoral vote , regardless of who wins the popular vote			0
states have the power to decide how their electoral votes get allocated , the @entity113 noted on its website			2
it cited a similar push for change after the 2000 election , when @entity14 vice president @entity121 won the national popular vote but lost the electoral vote , and therefore the decision , to @entity7 @entity124			1
from 2001 to 2006 , bills proposing adoption of the district system were introduced in many states , but failed to pass , according to the @entity113 website			0
both @entity83 and @entity82 adopted their district - based systems before 2000			0
the issue reflects the regionalization of @entity135 's deep partisan divide , with splits in many states between populous urban areas that tend to be more liberal and larger , less populated rural areas that generally are more conservative			0
in @entity8 , @entity13 got strong support in two heavily populated northern districts close to @entity0 as well as a district that includes much of @entity143 and @entity144			1
@entity18 won more rural districts in the central , southern and western parts of the state			0
overall in @entity8 , @entity13 got 51 % of the total vote -- more than 1.97 million -- compared to @entity18 's 1.82 million for 47 % of the total			2
@entity1 's @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0

new : a spokesman for the @entity8 *governor* says he does not support the proposal
@entity7 state legislatures consider changing how they allocate electoral votes
the proposed changes would have hurt president @entity13 in last year 's election
a similar push followed the hotly *contested* 2000 presidential election
