@entity0 -- a former @entity5 base chief wanted by @entity6 and detained in @entity7 has been released , a @entity3 spokeswoman said friday			1
@entity8 , who had been convicted by an @entity6 court for his role in a 2003 rendition case , was flying back to the @entity13			1
" it 's my understanding that he is in fact either en route or back in the @entity13			1
beyond that i have no further details , " @entity3 deputy spokeswoman @entity18 told reporters			2
in a 2009 trial , an @entity6 court convicted @entity8 and 22 others of abducting @entity25 , or @entity26 , from the streets of @entity28 in 2003			1
@entity6 prosecutors said @entity26 was nabbed by a @entity5 team working with @entity6 officials			2
the trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call " extraordinary rendition			0
" they say the @entity13 has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture			2
@entity26 , who was suspected of recruiting men to fight in @entity41 and @entity42 and was under heavy surveillance by @entity6 's intelligence agency , was transferred to @entity45 and tortured , @entity6 prosecutors said			0
a former senior @entity5 official said @entity8 is no longer with the @entity5			0
in the 2009 trial , the @entity6 court sentenced @entity8 to eight years in prison , prosecutor @entity47 said			1
the other @entity13 were sentenced to five years			0
each of the 23 @entity13 was ordered to pay 1 million euros ( about $ 1.3 million ) to @entity26 , plus 500,000 euros to his wife			0
but at the time , it seemed unlikely that the convictions would have much effect on the @entity13 , as none appeared at the trial and the @entity6 government did not ask for their extradition			1
@entity0 has acknowledged making secret " rendition " transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do .			0

an *ex-cia* base chief was arrested in @entity7 on an @entity6 arrest *warrant*
he was convicted in *absentia* for his role in a 2003 rendition case
the @entity3 says @entity8 is now headed to the @entity13
