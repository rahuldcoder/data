-- much has been written about the @entity2 ' marriage			1
the president and first lady have attested to the long and hard work it takes to stay involved and connected to each other while maintaining their separate identities			1
undoubtedly , sustaining a marriage is sometimes hard , as the first lady noted			1
but the @entity2 are an excellent example of how the fruits of marriage can be realized by those who are committed to reconciling their differences and " toughing it out			1
" the problem is that , today , too few couples are willing to make such a commitment			1
ever since @entity22 became the first state to sanction no - fault divorce law 40 years ago , with every state in essence following suit -- some with certain stipulations -- the most fundamental thread in the fabric of our @entity32 values , the institution of marriage , has been unraveling			1
before i retired from the bench a few months ago , it was my job as a judge to sort through all the issues rising , in part , from the growing lack of reverence many @entity32 have for marriage			1
in court , i often saw humanity 's worst behavior			0
i also dealt with teenage mothers , absentee fathers and parents who have never been married , often by choice			0
i saw parents who did n't seem able or willing to connect their children 's problems with their own failure to provide their children with the necessary road map to self - sufficiency and productivity			2
and these families did n't just show up in my courtroom			0
the @entity32 @entity61 shows a dramatic decline in the health of marriage in recent decades			2
@entity32 is a society that requires its citizens to make choices and penalizes them , often harshly , for the wrong ones			2
as a child grows up , the guideposts should be : finish school ; become a productive citizen ; marry a person you want to spend your life with ; and , if you want , have children			1
but many @entity32 are failing their children because they have already failed themselves			2
they often enter the court system with domestic problems and low - wage jobs , slim educational credentials and no life partners			2
it broke my heart to see so many children raising babies before they are ready : young people who made no connection between the poverty and chaos in their lives and the choices they had made			2
my options in addressing these problems from the bench were limited			0
the courtroom is seldom the stage at which social change takes place			0
by the time these cases appeared in court , so much damage had already been done			0
what our society needs is a solution on the front end			0
we should begin by considering six points : let 's stop glorifying single parenthood			1
celebrity unwed parents like " @entity116 , " @entity112 and the late @entity113 make matrimony seem unimportant and suggest that having a baby as a single parent is " cool " and even easy			1
our children need a reality check			2
many young people think that having a child means that they will finally have someone who will unconditionally love them			0
they do n't consider , however , that babies do not and can not love anyone but themselves , and they also take a tremendous amount of time , attention and resources			0
memo to single mothers by choice : when you decide to have a child alone in order to fulfill your deep need to parent , you may be deliberately substituting your emotional loss for that of your child , who will have to grow up without a father			1
we need to respect the role of men as husbands and fathers when they do right by their families			2
boys and girls need their fathers to love them and to model the sacrifice and commitment that bonds a married couple			2
men who " man up " like this need our support and encouragement			0
our state legislatures should revisit no - fault divorce laws that allow one party to a marriage to opt out of it too easily			1
@entity164 now can result in change in the future			0
although there are many success stories , children who grow up in single - parent families are less likely to enjoy the financial security , educational success and social skills of children living with their married parents			1
this only continues to fuel poverty and inequality in our country			0
by the way , i 'm neither a strait - laced goody - two - shoes nor @entity184 in heels			0
i would never condemn anyone who has had a child out of wedlock or who has gone through a divorce			0
i was a divorcee , and with two children , i was also a single mom			1
so i know that these things happen			0
indeed , sometimes they must happen			0
and because they do , we need to respect every family form			0
but i 've been around long enough to know that as marriage goes , so go our children			1
and with them goes the future of our country			0
consequently , everyone -- rich or poor , single or married or divorced , gay or straight , all races and colors , from the first family to the single - parent family -- benefits from a vibrant marriage culture			1
