-- reports of rapes , killings and other horrors are growing in the @entity5			2
rights groups accuse security forces and militia gangs of torturing civilians as world leaders warn that the nation is on the verge of a genocide			1
here 's a quick primer to get you up to speed on the escalating situation			2
tell me about the @entity5 the tiny , landlocked nation in central @entity20 is home to about 5 million people			1
it declared independence from @entity25 in 1960 , and has since been led by presidents or emperors			2
some have been elected while others seized power by force			2
despite vast resources , including gold , timber , diamonds and uranium , it 's among the poorest nations in the world			1
the riches from the minerals do n't trickle down to the population , fueling resentment			2
lack of good governance does not help , either			2
so what 's going on with all the chaos ? it started off as anti-government resentment			1
a coalition of rebels named @entity52 ousted president @entity53 in march , the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence			1
they accused the president of reneging on a peace deal , and demanded that he step down			1
months before his ouster , both sides had brokered a deal to form a unity government led by the president			1
but that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from the north toward the capital of @entity71 , seizing towns along the way			1
rebels infiltrated the capital in march , sending @entity53 fleeing to @entity76			1
what happened after the president left ? the nation plunged into complete chaos			1
looters hit the main cities			2
violence became the order of the day			2
aid agencies warned of a humanitarian crisis as fear of the rebels prevented critically injured patients from going to health facilities			1
an unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas that are too risky to access			2
more than 400,000 people have been internally displaced , according to the @entity97			2
that 's nearly 10 % of the population			0
who 's in charge of the nation now ? after the president fled , @entity52 named its commander , @entity104 , as the new leader			1
he took over and integrated some of the rebel fighters into the army , analysts say			0
was this the nation 's first instance of instability ? no. political turmoil is nothing new for the @entity5			1
about a decade ago , @entity53 led a coup that deposed his predecessor			1
though he later won elections in 2005 and 2011 , he did not have full control of the nation			1
rebel groups ran amok for years , especially in rural areas			0
in fact , four of the nation 's five presidents since independence have been ousted through unconstitutional means			1
ok , the president left and the rebels got their wish			1
why 's the fighting ongoing ? some say say greed is a factor			0
ousted government officials have long accused @entity52 of going after the country 's vast minerals			1
then there 's the reprisal aspect			0
when the president fled , the poorly - trained national army did n't stand a chance against the rebels			1
rebels capitalized on the army 's weakness and went on a rampage , human rights groups say			1
the list of horrors is endless : rape , torture , kidnappings , looting			0
to counter the attacks , vigilante groups formed			0
reprisals led to more mayhem			0
the country descended into anarchy and the @entity97 warned that " the seeds of a genocide are being sown			0
what role does religion play in the tensions ? good question			0
rights groups say @entity52 is a predominantly @entity172 coalition			1
as history has shown over and over , religious loyalties can breed contempt and escalate conflicts			0
in addition , the conflict has exposed years of marginalization and discrimination against the northern , predominantly @entity172 population , the @entity97 says			0
left uncontrolled , militia groups are banding along religious lines			0
most of the vigilante groups fighting back are @entity186 , leading to fears of a full - blown conflict between the country 's @entity186 and @entity172			0
all this is happening a world away			1
why should i care ? the @entity5 is surrounded by countries struggling to emerge from years of conflict			0
@entity195 , @entity195 's @entity197 region , the @entity198 and @entity199 are barely stable			0
any instability is sure to have ripple effects that 'll be hard to ignore worldwide			0
@entity202 is also believed to be one of @entity205 's hideouts			0
the @entity206 sent special forces to the region last year to help hunt down @entity205 , the brutal leader of the @entity209			0
in a sign of a potentially expanded role , the @entity210 recently said it 's considering sending aircraft to assault the @entity205 militia			0
the chaos not only risk destabilizing the region , they could complicate the @entity205 mission			1
what 's the current government doing ? the current president has tried to distance himself by disbanding @entity52 , @entity221 says			1
@entity104 , the president , has denied assertions that his country is on the brink of a genocide			2
" i do n't think there 's a genocide , there 's not even a religious war , all of this is made up , it 's to manipulate , to manipulate the opinion of the international community , " he told @entity227			0
he accused the former regime of fueling the rebellion			0
" they want to create a religious war by all means possible , " he says			0
" that 's what @entity53 wants			1
what is the international community doing ? though world leaders have warned of mass atrocities if nothing is done , the response has been limited			1
last month , @entity25 pledged to send 1,000 more troops to add to the 400 it already has there			0
the current troops in the nation , it says , are there in a noncombat mission to protect @entity25 nationals and help secure the airport in the capital			2
an @entity261 force is already in the nation			2
the @entity97 has suggested its peacekeeping force should eventually replace the @entity20 - led mission known , as @entity265			0
that potential force could number about 6,000 troops and 1,700 police personnel			0
turning it into a @entity97 peacekeeping operation would boost financial and logistical support .			0
