-- @entity3 's transition from autocratic to democratic rule will be a delicate one that will not occur overnight , observers told @entity0 monday as rebel forces appeared to solidify their hold on @entity8			1
the @entity9 , founded months ago in the rebel stronghold of @entity11 , is likely to move to @entity8 once the capital is secured , said @entity13 , a @entity3 scholar and dissident who is associate professor and chairman of the @entity16 and @entity17 at the @entity18 at @entity19			1
the @entity9 is working to minimize revenge killings , though some have already occurred , said @entity13 , who cited conversations earlier in the day with @entity9 members as his source			1
" if you are put in jail by somebody and you were tortured , you 're going to remember the person who kidnapped you , " he said			0
" it 's very difficult to control them			2
" efforts are under way to arrest leaders of the @entity35 regime and put them into protective custody , he said			0
" you find lots of hatred , " he said			0
but , he added , " they have to be fairly tried			0
i assure you that the intention of the ( council ) is to apply the rule of law			2
" he said that would not be a tough sell to the @entity3 people			1
after experiencing more than 40 years of lawlessness , " you begin to appreciate the law , " he said			0
" there was nothing wrong with the law @entity35 had ; he just never applied it			0
" asked how @entity3 will look in six months , he said , " much better than it does today			1
... at least you will have some law and order , you will have some accountability , constitutional frameworks , institutions that can be held accountable			0
" some @entity9 members are already in @entity8 , said @entity13 , who was planning to return next month to @entity8 for what would be his first visit to the capital in 30 years			1
" i 'm elated , " he said			0
rebels are working on a draft constitution that is based on the constitution that was in place before @entity35 took power nearly 42 years ago , he said			2
under one scenario , the @entity9 will continue to work for the next nine months to finish the constitution and hold elections			1
an alternative also under consideration is for the council to disband and call new elections within three months to form a new government , he said			1
there is concern about the @entity9 continuing to lead the new government during any transition because its members are self - selected and drawn largely from eastern @entity3			1
at least 20 senior members of the council were meeting monday in @entity79 , @entity80 , to plan the move to @entity8 within a few days , said @entity82 , a computer company executive in @entity83 , @entity84 , who was born in @entity3 and works closely with the @entity9 in an unofficial capacity			1
the council is working to establish television and radio stations to send messages of democracy to the populace , he said			2
he said the council membership was planning to increase its numbers from a few dozen to about 200 in order to more fully represent the country			2
but the overall transition to a democracy will take at least two years , he said			0
" you can not transition between a nondemocratic system to a reasonably accessible democratic system in less than 24 months , " he said			2
" i think we could live with that			0
" he said nongovernmental organizations like the @entity105 would prove critical to helping push the process forward			0
a key element to building a civil society will be the planned creation of a committee to be composed of a chairman and 14 ministers who will establish contacts with the technocrats who have run the country under @entity35 , he said			2
" many of them are honest , great people who know the lay of the land and what needs to be done to open airports , harbors and start communicating with the outside world , begin a process of reconciliation between tribes , " he said			2
he predicted that tribal rivalries will not emerge as an obstacle to democracy			0
" tribes have n't really been a major issue , " he said			0
" almost every tribe is in the game			0
" it will take 18 to 20 months to create a political framework for a new government , a @entity135 - based coordinator for @entity3 's @entity9 said monday			1
the council 's primary job is to stabilize the country and conduct temporary council elections , @entity138 told @entity0			1
it will write a new constitution , and the new government will likely be made up of " @entity3 nationalists , " he said			1
it will also include technocrats -- engineers , scientists and health professionals who will work to identify the country 's needs and re-establish its infrastructure			0
the council " is going to run the country , " @entity154 , the rebel government 's ambassador to the @entity156 , told @entity0 on monday			1
" of course , they have to take care of the security of the city and , of course , our concern now is where is @entity35 , " he said , referring to longtime leader @entity35			0
" we have to find out : where is he ? " formed this year , the council has won recognition as @entity3 's legitimate government from the @entity156 , @entity135 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172			1
in a symbol of its diplomatic credibility , the @entity3 embassy in @entity174 reopened under the control of the council			1
the former @entity3 ambassador under @entity35 is back in his old role , now representing the @entity9			1
the council regards itself as an interim entity that intends to shepherd the change to a new government			1
its power base has been in @entity11 , in the east			0
it includes representatives from throughout @entity3 and is headed by @entity189 , its chairman and a former justice minister under @entity35			1
the @entity9 has agreed to expand its membership to include " newly liberated parts " of @entity3 , said @entity194 , director of the @entity195 in @entity174			1
it has also pledged to appoint a constitutional drafting committee , and hold legislative and presidential elections , @entity194 said			0
he said the council chairman foresees a 10 - to 15 - month transition , and said the @entity9 has agreed the new constitution would make @entity202 " a " source of legislation , not " the " source			1
@entity194 spoke in july in a discussion moderated by @entity206 , a @entity3 expert at the @entity208			1
@entity156 @entity3 council president @entity209 , who spoke at the discussion , cited " key players " who would influence the transition			1
he said the @entity9 is the " main player in the transition , and a consensus has formed around both it and the leadership of @entity189			1
" but @entity209 said it faces challenges because it is " an umbrella group composed of a number of smaller groups with differing agendas			0
" if it does not evolve and become more representative , @entity209 warned , the @entity9 could be swept aside			1
other entities likely to prove influential during the transition are councils in @entity11 , @entity223 and smaller towns			0
@entity209 also cited a group of lawyers called @entity227 of 17th of february			0
" they claim revolutionary legitimacy , " yet their consistent challenges to the @entity9 could undermine the transition , he said			2
he noted that @entity202 , such as the @entity233 , are a " well - organized , " but small group			0
" the @entity233 in @entity3 are more traditional , closer to their @entity236 counterparts than to their more liberal @entity238 brethren , " he said			2
" they seek an undefined moderate @entity241 state with an active civil society			0
" @entity209 also cited " older regime elements , " including " technocrats of the old regime , the military , the revolution committees and professional syndicates			0
" @entity249 , a lawyer who negotiated the release in @entity251 two years ago of @entity252 , the man convicted of blowing up a @entity254 flight over @entity255 , said it is vital to establish a " coalition of cultures " that would represent all regions , tribes and factions to ensure a stable @entity262			0
he called on the international community to facilitate that coalition because " @entity3 do n't have the expertise to do it			2
" the rebellion was aided by a campaign of airstrikes by the @entity270 alliance , acting under a @entity272 mandate to protect civilians from government reprisals			0
as rebel fighters pushed into @entity8 , @entity270 secretary general @entity275 said the international community would help them usher in a new beginning			0
" now is the time to create a new @entity3 -- a state based on freedom , not fear ; democracy , not dictatorship ; the will of the many , not the whims of a few , " he said sunday in a statement			1
" that transition must come peacefully			0
and it must be led and defined by the @entity3 people			2
" there has been friction in the council , illustrated this month by @entity189 's dismissal of the rebels ' 14 - member executive board			1
the council acts as the opposition 's " legislative branch , " the @entity296 said in its background notes on @entity3			1
the council had initially appointed an executive committee , headed by @entity303 , to oversee interim issues			2
but @entity189 dismissed the board after the killing late last month of the rebel government 's military commander , gen. @entity306			1
his death played a role in the board members ' ouster , said @entity312 , the council 's media director			1
@entity306 and two other rebels were killed after the @entity9 sought to question him about allegations that he or those close to him were maintaining ties to @entity35 , @entity306 ' supporters have said			1
@entity189 commissioned @entity303 to move quickly to submit new names to be considered for a new board , @entity312 said , but no deadline was mentioned			0
in july , rebel military council member @entity322 released a statement that appeared to imply that @entity35 loyalists had something to do with @entity306 ' killing			2
a one - time general in @entity35 's army , @entity306 told @entity0 in february that he had switched sides after @entity35 told him he planned to bomb @entity11 -- a move he said would have killed thousands of civilians			0
@entity332 of the @entity333 cautioned sunday that rebels still have a " very , very long way to go			0
" " they 're confronted with a situation where they have to build the @entity3 state from the ground up , " he said			2
" who is going to pick up the pieces ? how unified are they going to be ? "			0
