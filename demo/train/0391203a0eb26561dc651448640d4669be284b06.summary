to @entity1 , @entity0 is fraught with voter fraud and the state is doing nothing about it			1
so the former @entity6 veteran has taken matters into his own hands and vows , as he sees it , to save the system from eroding honest elections			1
@entity1 launched the @entity13 more than three years ago , leading a band of volunteers in scouring public records and knocking on doors to root out irregularities in voter rolls			1
it 's tedious work , and @entity1 has generated mixed results as well as a measure of controversy			2
some call his efforts " sloppy " and question whether he 's addressing a serious shortcoming or whether he 's become -- intended or not -- illustrative of the tough @entity28 - driven voter identification law that critics contend intimidates and disenfranchises minority voters			1
moreover , this is all playing out amid hardening partisan divisions nationwide and legal and legislative battles as the nation hurtles toward a midterm vote with the @entity39 at stake and a presidential ballot in 2016			2
a man with a mission at the vip headquarters in a commercial office park in @entity46 that resembled many low - budget start - ups , complete with a dry - ink erase board , folding tables with chairs and a big wood , scuffed desk , @entity1 proudly walked through the inter workings of his organization that includes a few dozen volunteers spread around the state			2
bald and 56 , he seems at least a decade younger than his age			2
his enthusiasm screams through his rabidly opinionated professions about how voting should work			0
he thinks the mentally ill should be barred from voting , felons should be restored their voting right after they serve their sentence and probation , homeless people should be allowed to vote but only if they remain at the address they put on their voter registration form , and those who do n't know the issues should stay home			1
@entity1 co-opted his tactics from @entity73 , a well - funded yet controversial conservative group in @entity74 that prioritizes citizen enforcement of the voter laws			1
framed by a 12 - foot long map of @entity0 divided into counties and congressional districts on loan from a @entity28 member of the state legislature , @entity1 also talks about the need for a strict photo id law and that fraudulent voting is rampant in elections			1
and he 's doing everything he can to ensure that his vision of the election system is carried out			1
to address their concerns , @entity1 and his volunteers plow through public data -- tax records , voting records , jury records , census data and death records - scouring for suspicion and inconsistencies			0
he compares tax data with @entity101 records , voting records in @entity0 with voting records in @entity104 , jury data with voter rolls			1
he calls it data mining			0
all this information is then inserted into an algorithm , creating spreadsheets upon spreadsheets for volunteers to investigate			0
when red flags are raised , they might turn it over to the @entity117 or they might check it out themselves			0
looking in a liberal bastion in @entity122 , which includes the western city of @entity124 , a liberal bastion in a relatively conservative state , @entity1 's forces teamed with a local tea party group to analyze data			0
when five or more registered voters are listed at one address , a red flag goes up			1
then they put on their shoes and pound the pavement			0
" we would actually knock on the door at that address , " @entity1 said			0
his volunteers would check to see who lived there and if it matched the records			0
the response ? " some would slam the door in our face , " @entity1 said , but added that others would answer their questions			0
if doubts persisted after confronting residences , they 'd move to @entity150			0
@entity151 would address a letter to the person in question			0
if the letter came back with " return to sender , " that letter became evidence to submit to the @entity117			0
@entity1 said a worst - case scenario would involve someone voting fraudulently or , at the very least , they need to be removed from the voter rolls for not living at the address listed			1
@entity1 took 180 cases to the @entity122 elections board and a little more than half the names were stricken from the voter rolls			1
@entity168 , a volunteer with the @entity13 and head of the @entity170 who participated in the door - to - door checks , said the reason they are checking the voter rolls name by name is simple : " we 're doing it because the ( political ) parties are n't			1
" @entity182 group in @entity0 might give up on national races vigilante or vindicator ? @entity1 and his group are an aggravating nuisance whose tactics do more damage than good , according to fellow good governance groups with opposing ideological views			1
@entity192 , president of @entity193 , said vip targets minority and @entity196 leaning districts , leading to voter disenfranchisement and voter intimidation			1
she said that of the 80 precincts in @entity122 , all of @entity13 's challenges came from 11 precincts , most of them low income or minority -- communities that are more likely to have more people living under one roof			1
" it has an intimidation effect , " @entity192 said , detailing the story of one @entity213 woman who said she did n't feel comfortable when people showed up at her door and wanted to know where her sons lived			0
2014 midterms : what 's at stake @entity192 also said he has effectively removed homeless people from the voter rolls for not being at a fixed address			1
@entity1 shot back , saying @entity192 needs to " cut the emotion and deal with the facts			0
" " our laws are so lenient in favor of the voter that any person can claim they 're homeless and vote from anywhere , " @entity1 said			1
@entity0 's tamp down @entity0 's election record is good			1
the @entity236 ' election initiative named it one of the top - performing states in 2012			2
the organization cited increased voter registration , few problems with provisional ballots and minimal wait times at polls			2
of the 88 % of eligible voters are registered to vote , more than 65 % voted in 2012 , according to the @entity245 and confirmed by the state			2
that turnout is similar to 2008 and both elections saw @entity213 vote at a higher rate than whites , according to @entity251 , an election watchdog group			1
in addition , cases of fraud are negligible			2
the state 's board of elections says fraud is possible but the state does n't keep track			1
elections board spokesman @entity262 said in the most recent statewide elections on may 6 , one case of fraud was referred to the the local district attorney 's office and he anticipates " at least three other " cases will be investigated by the board of elections			1
but still , the state enacted one of the most stringent voter id laws in the country , requiring one of a limited number of forms of identification at the poll starting in 2016			1
the law also gives voter vigilantes more power , enabling citizens to challenge another person 's vote anywhere in the state			2
like laws of its kind that have been passed and challenged elsewhere , including in @entity286 and @entity287 where the courts struck down the laws , @entity0 's law is being challenged for disenfranchising voters			1
@entity291 , political science professor at @entity292 , said the law discourages people to vote , adding that the state that voted for @entity295 @entity294 in 2008 and @entity28 @entity296 in 2012 has taken a step backward			0
5 takeaways from @entity0 's primary election " they 've gone the wrong direction in the importance of protecting the vote , " @entity291 said			1
" they 've erred on the side of making sure no ineligible person would vote			0
" while @entity1 aggressively advocated for the law , he pushed for a version that went even further			0
and thinks the state is n't doing enough to enforce the laws and that high voter participation is an indicator that fraud is rampant			1
mixed results after three years of work and countless volunteer hours , @entity1 has no cases of fraud to show			2
he cites , however , that the board of elections has made five " referrals " of prosecution to local district attorneys			2
he blames the @entity28 - led board of elections and the inherent difficulty in the system to confirm fraud in the election system			1
" we thought with two republicans in charge they would work with us , " @entity1 said			0
" even when we do the right thing , the authorities do n't really care			0
" his group also challenged 130 people who are on the voter rolls who got out of jury duty for saying they were n't a citizen			2
but the board of elections rejected their challenge			2
despite falling short on the fraud front , the group has had some impact , including pushing the state to conduct more thorough list maintenance			2
he has played a role in removing about 30,000 people from the voter rolls , most of whom had died , which was confirmed by a state - led audit			2
that 's in addition to an ongoing state issued review of another 155,000 people who are also registered in other states			0
and to the chagrin of some and the delight of others , they 've helped to raise the issue to a whole new level in the state			0
" they 've caused bureaucratic wheels to turn , " @entity291 said			0
@entity262 said they welcome the work @entity1 - and all good governance groups - are doing			0
the state is looking into some of @entity151 's findings , including 149 instancevs of people with the same name and birthday who voted in @entity0 and in @entity104			1
but @entity383 , executive director of @entity251 , a voter protection organization , said @entity1 's group does " sloppy " research and submits piles of claims to the board of elections to sift through with no substantial outcome			1
" they have the appearance of being a research group but they operate like a witch hunt group , " @entity383 said			0
" that 's not useful			0
" @entity1 dismisses his critics and states the overall goal			0
" we want to figure out how people are voting multiple times			0
that 's the whole ball game , " he said			0
