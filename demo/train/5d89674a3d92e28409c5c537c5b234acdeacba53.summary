-- the upcoming presidential election will likely hinge on whether voters trust president @entity3 or @entity4 to restore a robust economy			1
presidents have less power over the economy than they and most people believe -- @entity9 , the @entity10 , and the economy 's inherent dynamics all play major roles -- but the president can lead on key issues and set the tone for economic policy			2
to understand how the @entity4 and @entity3 views differ , consider two issues			1
the first is how to avoid the so - called " fiscal cliff			0
" under current policy , substantial tax hikes and spending cuts kick in on january 1 , 2013			0
the @entity25 tax cuts , in particular , are scheduled to expire , and both domestic and military spending are scheduled to fall , under the debt ceiling deal of august 2011			0
both candidates view this tightening in fiscal policy as a threat to economic recovery , but they differ on which aspects to modify			2
@entity3 wants to continue the @entity25 tax cuts on middle - class households but let them expire on high - income households			2
and @entity3 opposes the automatic spending cuts in general , although most observers suspect he would be open to some cuts in military spending			2
@entity42 : tax deduction cap -- how much would it raise and who would pay ? @entity4 also wants to extend the @entity25 tax cuts , but for all households rather than just the middle class			2
in fact , @entity4 has called for further reductions in tax rates , including those on corporate income			1
@entity4 will likely accept cuts to domestic spending while opposing those to the defense budget			2
@entity3 , therefore , will use negotiations over the fiscal cliff to push greater redistribution of income and for shifts in expenditure from military to domestic programs ; @entity4 the reverse			1
neither candidate , of course , describes his position in these terms			0
@entity3 will paint the debate over tax policy as about fairness , while @entity4 will say it is about promoting economic growth			1
@entity3 will defend domestic expenditure as " investment " in our future , while @entity4 will characterize much of it as waste			1
regardless , the two have different priorities for taxes and spending			0
on the tax side , @entity4 's position is more convincing			1
raising rates on high - income households will generate only modest revenue , and higher rates on dividends and capital gains are bad for growth			1
likewise , lower corporate tax rates will boost growth			2
more broadly , @entity3 's focus on redistribution sends a chilling message to entrepreneurs and innovators , and any negative impact on growth makes the debt situation worse			1
on the budget , neither candidate is sufficiently skeptical of federal spending			0
@entity3 errs in believing that federal expenditure is mainly " investment			2
" in reality , huge chunks -- such as drug prohibition , the @entity112 for the @entity113 , the @entity114 , @entity115 , earmarks , the @entity117 , @entity118 , foreign aid , agricultural subsidies , the @entity121 , along with bridges to nowhere , the @entity108 , and high - speed rail -- are wasteful			0
opinion : @entity4 's radical economic plan for @entity126 @entity4 makes a similar mistake for military spending			1
many defense and national security activities , such as the ongoing war in @entity132 , provision of national security for nations in @entity136 and other parts of the globe , not to mention unnecessary weapons systems , redundant military bases , and more , are difficult to justify			0
the second big issue facing @entity3 or @entity4 will be taming the growth of @entity143			1
both candidates agree that , under current projections , @entity143 grows faster than the national 's overall economic output forever , which means @entity143 is essentially bankrupt			1
@entity4 and @entity3 disagree , however , on how to fix @entity143			1
@entity3 's approach consists of the @entity149 , a creation of the @entity151			1
the @entity149 will have the power to restrict @entity143 expenditure , chiefly by controlling health care prices and limiting reimbursement for care deemed unnecessary or not cost - effective			0
@entity4 wants to shift most or all future @entity143 beneficiaries ( those currently 55 and younger ) to vouchers			1
by limiting the rate at which the voucher amount increases over time , this approach can also slow @entity143 expenditure			1
and if competition among insurers makes the health insurance market more efficient , vouchers can reduce spending further			0
both approaches , therefore , aim to " save @entity143 , " but in fundamentally different ways : the @entity149 relies on government to decide what health care is valuable , while the voucher approach lets individuals make those choices			1
of the two , @entity3 's has little chance of success , given the failure of similar efforts in the past			2
price controls incentivize health care providers to game the system , such as by billing for extra tests , procedures , and medications			0
this also means that price controls will introduce myriad inefficiencies in the health care system			0
the @entity4 voucher approach has more potential , but the devil is in the details			2
any voucher system must include enough insurers to generate real competition			0
and the definition of " health insurance " must be sufficiently broad that competing insurers can offer policies that genuinely limit costs			0
in addition , the most obvious way that insurers can lower premiums is by raising co-payments and deductibles			0
this would be a good outcome , since it would encourage seniors to balance the benefits and costs of health care			0
yet this also means seniors would pay more , a fact not often emphasized by advocates of vouchers			0
@entity3 's and @entity4 's economic visions differ , therefore , on three fundamental issues : how much government should redistribute income ; what kind of federal spending is worth its costs ; and whether governments or markets allocate resources more efficiently			1
the choice is not unambiguous , but overall @entity4 has the better view			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0

@entity235 economist @entity233 says both candidates ' economic plans have flaws
he says @entity4 's position on taxes is stronger , higher rates will curb growth
@entity233 says both candidates try to control the *unsustainable* growth of @entity143
he says @entity3 seeks to use government to curb costs while @entity4 relies on a voucher plan
