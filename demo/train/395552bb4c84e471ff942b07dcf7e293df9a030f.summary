editor 's note : @entity2 , a political scientist , is president of the @entity4 , a nonprofit think tank on issues affecting the @entity8 community			1
he is co-editor of " @entity9 in @entity10 : @entity9 in the @entity12 @entity11 , " and author of the " @entity14			1
" @entity2 says @entity16 's identification as a @entity17 has caused her joy and a little grief			1
@entity11 ( @entity20 ) -- the nomination of @entity16 for associate justice of the @entity23 has raised the profile of @entity9 in the @entity26 consciousness			1
her identification as a @entity17 has caused @entity16 both joy and a little grief during this stormy nomination process			2
but , being a @entity17 who also grew up in @entity11 , well , i can say that 's par for the course for most of us			1
despite @entity9 being a possession of the @entity26 since 1898 , most @entity26 know very little about the island and @entity9 -- except for tourism commercials			1
many consider @entity9 living in the @entity26 outside of @entity9 ( i called these " stateside @entity9 " ) another new immigrant group of @entity41			2
but the reality is that we can trace @entity17 settlements in @entity45 to the 1860s and workers from @entity9 migrated to @entity48 around 1900			2
in 1917 , through an act of the @entity51 ( the @entity52 ) , the people of @entity9 were made @entity26 citizens , enabling them to come to the @entity26 freely and legally without passport or visa			1
i grew up in the @entity57 section of @entity58 , @entity11 , in an area known as " @entity60 " ( @entity61 )			0
born in @entity63 , @entity9 , in 1951 , my mother brought me to @entity11 when i was only 6 months old			2
now , to point out how different we are from most @entity26 , check this out : despite living 99 percent of my life in @entity11 and being a @entity26 citizen for 100 percent of my life , under some interpretations of the law , because i was not born in a state of the @entity26 ( nor were my parents ) , i may not even be eligible to run for president of the @entity26 ! i am not sure how this has affected my career development , but i am sure it has resulted in some deep psychological trauma that i have yet to understand			2
@entity9 have been migrating to the @entity26 since the 1800s , but it was n't until @entity80 that this population movement peaked			2
at the time of this " @entity83 " over 80 percent of the @entity17 population in the @entity26 lived in @entity11			1
" @entity88 , " " the @entity89 , " @entity86 ' book , " @entity90 , " all tried to capture this experience			0
it was a time when we became social guinea pigs , the subjects of @entity98 ' " culture of poverty " experiments and the like			0
fast forward to today : the 800,000 @entity9 in @entity11 represent about 20 percent of the more than 4 million @entity9 living stateside			2
there are now more @entity9 living stateside than in @entity9			0
the fastest - growing @entity17 settlements in the @entity26 are in @entity101 and the @entity102 , not in the @entity103 and @entity104 where @entity9 traditionally migrated			1
while once seen as basically a very poor community , the stateside @entity17 community has become more economically , politically and culturally complex than ever			1
alongside very poor @entity9 in areas such as the @entity109 , there are growing middle - class @entity17 neighborhoods in the @entity11 suburbs			1
settlements in states such as @entity101 , @entity115 and @entity116 are full of @entity17 professionals --- surgeons , engineers , lawyers			0
where once this was seen as a very politically liberal community captured by the @entity121 , in these newer settlements we are seeing a growing trend toward conservative politics			0
there are about 4 million residents , 95 percent of whom identify as @entity17			0
@entity9 is a territorial possession of the @entity26 , which was formally defined a commonwealth after a vote by its residents in 1952			0
the @entity51 is currently debating its future political status -- whether it should remain a commonwealth , or become a state or an independent nation			0
and it appears @entity9 living stateside are as divided on this question as those in @entity9			0
the @entity26 @entity23 once described @entity9 's relationship to the @entity26 as " foreign in a domestic sense			1
" do n't worry , i do n't know what that means either			0
but it does point to a rather convoluted relationship embodied in a series of @entity23 decisions called the @entity149			0
the bottom line is @entity9 is an integral part of the @entity26			1
they use the same currency , follow the same laws and are subject to the same federal courts system			0
they even have the same fast food places -- so they are killing themselves dietarily just like the rest of the @entity26			0
however , did you know that despite being @entity26 citizens , the people of @entity9 ca n't vote for the @entity26 president ? and @entity9 is excluded when the @entity163 reports its numbers on @entity8 population in the @entity26 ? so , next time you hear a report on @entity26 @entity8 population , add 4 million to get it right ! as judge @entity16 's @entity17 heritage is discussed in reference to her nomination , it is clear that it is an experience that is thoroughly @entity26			1
exotic as we may sound to some , we are a people just trying to get by and as bewildered by @entity26 politics and jusiprudence as the next guy			0
@entity16 , as a @entity17 , is , well , as @entity26 as mango pie			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity16 is part of @entity11 's large @entity17 community
he says @entity9 were granted @entity26 citizenship in 1917
he says @entity9 in the states *outnumber* those on the island
@entity2 : @entity16 's ethnic heritage is throughly @entity26
