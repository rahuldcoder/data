@entity0 -- @entity3 tv aired images thursday of what it says is a @entity7 stealth drone that went down in @entity3 last week , an apparently intact @entity9 drone propped on a pedestal and triumphantly displayed			1
" military experts are well aware how precious the technological information of this drone is , " said @entity11			2
gen. @entity15 , commander of the @entity16 , according to the semi-official @entity17			0
there was disagreement among @entity21 officials about whether the drone in the video is real			1
military and intelligence officials were analyzing the @entity3 television footage			1
one @entity7 official said right now the @entity7 ca n't be certain it 's the real stealth drone , because @entity7 personnel do n't have access to it			1
but he added there 's no reason to think it 's a fake			1
however , a second senior @entity7 military official said that a big question is to how the drone could have remained virtually intact given the high altitude it is believed to have crashed from			1
earlier thursday , a @entity21 spokesman said the video is being examined			2
" we 've seen the imagery			0
there are folks that are looking at it , " capt. @entity43 told a news conference			0
he and his fellow spokesman , @entity49 , would not comment further on whether the drone is the one that the @entity7 military said went missing			1
they did say that the missing @entity7 drone had not been recovered			1
@entity55 , director of @entity56 , said his initial impression from pictures sent to him by @entity1 is n't what one would expect to see after a crash			0
he said he was guessing that the object is a mock - up prepared for a parade , noting a @entity7 flag in the picture			2
@entity55 pointed out that the wings in the picture droop down , whereas in most pictures of such a drone the wings are higher than the center , which is good for stability @entity73 , an aviation analyst , said the craft appears to be the @entity9 and it looks real to him			0
if the drone came down in what he called a flat spin or what is known as a falling leaf departure , the plane would be pretty much intact , but the belly would be badly scraped			2
he said all of the electronics inside would most likely be in one piece			0
@entity73 doubts the @entity3 hacked into the system and took control of the aircraft			2
it is much more likely it crashed by itself since " that 's what drones do			0
" and the condition also suggests it was not shot down but was a system failure			0
there are no burn marks from a fire , no holes and no outward damage			0
@entity73 noticed a dent along the leading edge but does n't know what that necessarily means			0
" it 's fairly clear here from the pictures that the outer wings have been separated			0
the question is , did that happen in the accident or ( did they take ) them off to move the aircraft , " @entity109 said			0
the @entity116 and the @entity21 would not comment on the latest development			0
two @entity7 officials confirmed to @entity1 on tuesday that the missing drone was part of a @entity116 reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in @entity124			1
a senior @entity7 official with direct access to the assessment about what happened to the unmanned aircraft said it was tasked to fly over western @entity124 and look for insurgent activity , with no directive either to fly into @entity3 or spy on @entity3 from @entity124 airspace			1
a @entity7 satellite quickly pinpointed the downed drone , which apparently sustained significant damage , the senior official said			1
aired by the official @entity139 network , the video thursday showed different angles of the unmanned aircraft			2
it had been flying over the eastern town of @entity144 when it went down , the network said			0
" recently , our collected intelligence and precise electronic monitoring revealed that this aircraft intended to infiltrate our country 's airspace for spying missions , " @entity15 said			0
" after it entered the eastern parts of the country , this aircraft fell into the trap of our armed forces and was downed in @entity3 with minimum damage			1
" @entity15 said the plane 's wingspan " is around 26 meters ( 85 feet )			0
" it is 4.5 meters ( 14 feet , 9 inches ) long , 1.84 meters ( 6 feet ) tall and " is equipped with highly advanced surveillance , data gathering , electronic communication and radar systems , " he said			0
@entity15 said @entity165 and @entity167 planes have used the technology found in the aircraft , which is guided via satellite link and land stations in @entity124 and the @entity7			2
" as far as its platform and coating are concerned , this kind of plane has been designed to evade radar systems and from the viewpoint of technology it is amongst the most recent types of advanced aircraft used by the @entity7 , " @entity15 said			2
the official @entity182 and @entity17 said @entity3 's @entity183 summoned the @entity185 ambassador to @entity3 , who received an official reprimand for the @entity7 actions			1
@entity185 represents @entity7 interests in @entity3 , which does n't have diplomatic relations with the @entity7			1
@entity3 demanded @entity7 reparations for the act , which it says is " against every international law and regulation , as well as contrary to the region 's peace and security , " @entity190 said			1
meanwhile , @entity3 's @entity200 ambassador said in a letter thursday to the world body that the drone flew 250 kilometers ( 150 miles ) into @entity3 territory " to the northern region of the city of @entity207			1
" the letter from @entity210 @entity209 to @entity200 @entity211 and the heads of the @entity213 and @entity214 did not specify how the drone ended up in the hands of the @entity3 , saying only it " faced prompt and forceful action " by the armed forces			1
" my government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the @entity7 government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the @entity3 in clear contravention of international law , in particular , the basic tenets of the @entity228 , " @entity209 's letter said			1
he called for @entity200 condemnation of @entity7 " acts of aggression , " as well as " clear and effective measures to be taken to put an end to these dangerous and unlawful acts in line with the @entity228 ' responsibilities to maintain international and regional peace and security			2
" @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 contributed to this report .			0
