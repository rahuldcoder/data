the investigative arm of @entity8 , the @entity9 also found that 250,000 pieces of body armor and helmets ca n't be accounted for			0

auditors were unable to determine whether the weapons -- which included heavy machine guns and rocket - propelled grenade launchers -- were stolen , being used by insurgents or still in the hands of @entity6 units			2
