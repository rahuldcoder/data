@entity1 president @entity42 said tuesday that the killings " caused great pain for the people of @entity1 , " @entity41 insurgents have vowed to avenge the killings , and gunshots and grenades echoed in the distance as the victims were buried tuesday			1

" according to my information , two to three @entity1 security forces have been injured			1
" @entity51 said high - level @entity1 officials , including @entity42 's brother , a minister and a deputy minister , were attending the funeral when the attacks took place			1
the targets appeared to be @entity1 investigators collecting evidence in the neighboring village of @entity72 , where the remaining victims died			2
the @entity41 have battled @entity9 and @entity75 troops , as well as @entity1 government forces , since the 2001 invasion after the september 11 attacks on @entity79 and @entity26			1
after sunday 's killings , they described @entity9 troops as " sick - minded @entity9 savages			2
" in a new statement tuesday , they said they would take revenge " by killing and beheading @entity9 anywhere in the country			1
" a protest in @entity90 , near the border with @entity92 , drew hundreds of people tuesday , with demonstrators blocking the highway to @entity0 , provincial government spokesman @entity88 said			0
the highway was reopened later tuesday			0
the still - unidentified soldier blamed for the attack has yet to be charged			0
he turned himself in to his fellow @entity9 after the killings and could face the death penalty , defense secretary @entity98 said			2
@entity1 's parliament has demanded a public trial for the suspect , but @entity9 officials said they will handle the investigation and prosecution themselves			1

tuesday , two senior military officials told @entity2 that security cameras monitoring the perimeter of the outpost showed the sergeant leaving the outpost alone and returning alone			1

speaking at the @entity150 , @entity25 said he has told @entity42 that the @entity9 " takes this as seriously as if it was our own citizens and our own children who were murdered			1
" " the killing of innocent civilians is outrageous and it 's unacceptable			1
it 's not who we are as a country and it does not represent our military , " he said			0

" there 's no question that we face a difficult challenge in @entity1 , but i 'm confident that we can continue the work of meeting our objectives , protecting our country and responsibly bringing this war to a close , " he said			2
@entity186 , a former official with the @entity75 command in @entity0 , said the reaction to sunday 's massacre may not force a shift in allied strategy , but could cause " an increase to the pace of transition			0
" but the demonstrations have been muted compared with the deadly riots that followed the disclosure that @entity9 troops had burned copies of the @entity202 -- mistakenly , their commanders said			2
" not to be callous in any way , but the @entity1 are in some ways used to the civilian casualty incidents and tend to respond to it in a more reserved manner than something that seems to be a direct and personal affront to their religion and culture , " @entity186 said			0
in other incidents adding to the strain on @entity9 - @entity1 relations , @entity9 commanders condemned a video of a squad of @entity219 urinating on bodies in january , and several soldiers -- from @entity222 in @entity223 , like the suspect in sunday 's shooting -- were charged with taking part in a rogue " kill squad			1
" as he set out monday for a trip to the region , @entity98 said the @entity9 and its @entity75 allies " seem to get tested almost every other day			0
" but , he added , " it is important that , all of us , @entity9 , @entity1 , the ( @entity75 - led ) forces all stick to the strategy that we 've laid out			1
" " @entity236 , " he said			0
" these kind of events and incidents are going to take place			0
