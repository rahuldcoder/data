-- @entity1 was cruising across the @entity3 - @entity2 when a piece of steel and a giant cable crashed down			1
he was just 50 yards away			2
the @entity7 was just far enough away that he did n't see the debris as it fell			1
but he did see cars quickly move to the right lanes to avoid the mess			2
the falling debris forced the closure of the bridge and snarled traffic between @entity2 and @entity3 , @entity16 , as commuters look for alternate ways to get to and from the cities			1
it 's also forcing structural engineers to look at key questions around the nation 's infrastructure : has the nation done enough to address crucial bridges two years after the tragic collapse of a bridge in @entity29 that killed 13 people ? the answer , experts say , is no. the pieces that fell this week raise even more troubling issues because repairs had just been made in september to the same section of the 73 - year - old bridge , which spans the @entity38 and carries an average of 280,000 vehicles daily			1
over @entity42 , crews worked to repair a damaged steel beam			0
" the bridge has been inspected , and it is now safer than when we closed it , " @entity44 , the director of the @entity45 , said at the time			1
@entity50 , a structural engineering professor at the @entity52 , says he 's concerned that authorities took a " @entity55 " approach in september			0
" it failed , " he said			0
he 's worried about what he calls " fracture - critical " bridges : roughly 460 bridges across the country that are in dire need of repairs			1
" following the @entity29 bridge collapse , there was a lot of discussion because of emotions , " he said			1
" i did n't really see a sustained effort that says , ' we are going to replace these fracture - critical bridges			0
' " federal regulators said support plates that were about half as thick as they should have been were the likely cause of the august 1 , 2007 , bridge collapse in @entity29 that killed 13 people and injured 145			1
the gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the @entity81 over the @entity82 in @entity83 , according to the @entity84			0
a new bridge has since opened in @entity29 , what the @entity86 hailed as one of the nation 's @entity90 transportation feats this year			1
" it is critical that our transportation systems receive the funding necessary to keep @entity96 moving			0
but even more important is that our state and local governments use that money to deliver projects that quickly meet the needs of our communities , " @entity97 , the group 's executive director , said in a recent report			0
but engineers say that 's the problem : repairs are n't happening quick enough			1
if a tragedy like the @entity29 collapse does n't get people 's attention , they wonder , what will ? " i have seen some lip service , but i have not seen a lot of momentum and action , " said @entity114 , a professor of civil engineering at @entity52			1
" part of that is due to the economic recession			0
when @entity16 has a budget deficit of $ 25 billion , they do n't worry about bridges			0
they worry about closing the budget gap			0
" @entity128 , a civil engineering consultant based out of @entity2 , says the @entity29 collapse put critical bridge problems front and center before the @entity96 public			1
" in the engineering community , we knew these things many years ago , and there were requests for money , which was n't coming , " @entity128 said			0
but he says funding has n't kept up @entity139			0
according to a 2009 @entity143 report , more than 26 percent of the nation 's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete			0
the @entity86 estimated in 2008 that it would cost roughly $ 140 billion to repair every deficient bridge in the country			2
bridges are typically inspected every two years			0
" if we do n't start making substantial progress in five years , we will have more collapses , " @entity114 said			0
the @entity2 opened in 1936 and spans 8.4 miles			1
it was the largest and most expensive bridge -- $ 77 million -- of its time			2
the bridge is best known to most @entity96 from the 1989 @entity154 earthquake			2
a 50 - foot section of the bridge collapsed during the quake , killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake - tolerant			2
part of the bridge , the @entity163 , is a suspension bridge			2
the other portion of the bridge , known as the @entity167 , is a truss - cantilever design			2
this week 's falling debris happened on the @entity167 , which is in the process of being replaced .			1

falling debris on @entity2 raises questions about repairs after @entity29 collapse
bridge *remains* shut , snarling traffic across @entity179
