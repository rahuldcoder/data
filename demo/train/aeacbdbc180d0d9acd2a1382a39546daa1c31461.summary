-- @entity4 leader @entity3 was visiting @entity5 on friday , a @entity2 official said , according to state - run @entity7 news agency			1
the report contradicts earlier ones that @entity3 's son and heir apparent , @entity12 , was leading the visit			2
it was unclear whether his son was accompanying him			0
according to @entity7 , the trip would be @entity3 's third to @entity5 in a little over a year			1
the news follows last week 's revelation that @entity2 president @entity20 has officially invited @entity3 to attend a nuclear security summit in @entity22 next year			1
@entity2 pay close attention to the movements of the leadership of @entity4 , perhaps the world 's most secretive regime			1
@entity4 state media is often slow in reporting the @entity30 ' activities			0
@entity31 for @entity4 , a @entity2 non-governmental organization , said @entity3 was visiting @entity5			1
the organization is partly staffed by defectors from the @entity4			0
it maintains a network of informants in @entity4			0
" i checked through my sources , and one had heard from a military officer working at the border yesterday that there was some kind of ' emergency ' along the border , " said @entity37 , the organization 's president			0
" according to that military officer , it was @entity3 who is going -- not his son			0
" his account and the @entity2 news agency report could not be independently verified			2
the term of @entity5 president @entity52 's term is set to expire next year , prompting some to anticipate greater diplomatic interchange between @entity54 and @entity55 as @entity3 seeks to forge relations with the incoming leader			1
it 's clear that @entity4 needs help , analysts said			0
" @entity3 wants to get something from @entity2 or the @entity64 or @entity5 -- economic aid or security assurances -- but at the moment he is not getting anything and @entity5 is preventing @entity4 from further provocations , " said @entity61 - wook of @entity22 's @entity62			1
" @entity3 wants to know what @entity5 is going to do for them			2
" heavily sanctioned following several nuclear and missile tests , @entity55 has been reaching out to @entity2 in recent months -- experts say the hardline state is desperate for a resumption of food aid			0
however , its customary form of leverage -- provocations -- is being restrained by @entity54 , and six - party talks , which would offer economic incentives in return for @entity4 denuclearization , have been in limbo for more than two years			0
former @entity64 president @entity86 , who visited @entity55 and @entity22 last month , carried a message from @entity3 to @entity2 's @entity20 , in which the @entity4 leader said he was ready to meet with the @entity2 's president " without preconditions			1
" @entity22 's policy is to refuse high - level contacts until @entity4 apologizes for two incidents last year that killed 50 @entity2			1
@entity2 accuses the @entity4 of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in march 2010 , killing 46 sailors			2
in november , @entity4 shelled @entity98 , killing two @entity2 marines and two civilians			2
last week , however , @entity20 invited @entity3 to visit @entity2			2
" the @entity2 government did deliver a message of our invitation to @entity4 's leader to visit next year 's @entity106 in @entity22 , " the foreign press officer from the presidential office said			1
few , however , expect @entity3 -- a virtual recluse whose political decisions are made behind closed doors and who is reportedly paranoid about personal security -- to engage in such high - profile , transparent statesmanship as an international nuclear summit , or to visit @entity22			0
the last two @entity117 presidential summits took place in @entity55 .			0

an @entity2 official says @entity3 is in @entity5 , according to report
it is his third visit there in *slightly* over a year
@entity2 play close attention to the leadership 's movement in @entity4
it 's hard to obtain *reliable* information from and about @entity4
