@entity0 -- @entity2 have a message for voters during the final , frenzied day of campaigning : all is not lost			1
party leaders insist they can still hold onto the @entity8 -- their last bastion of power on @entity11 -- and are spending the remaining hours before the polls open on tuesday trying to convince their voters not to give up			1
" i do n't agree with the oddsmakers , " vice president @entity14 said in an exclusive interview with @entity1 chief political analyst @entity16			1
" i predict we 're gon na ... keep the @entity8			0
" everything would have to break for @entity2 just right for @entity14 's optimism to carry the day			1
new polls in states that @entity2 must win if they have any hope of keeping the @entity8 are n't promising			1
in @entity26 , a @entity25 poll released sunday shows @entity2 sen. @entity27 and @entity29 challenger @entity28 in a deeply competitive race			1
the poll puts @entity27 's support at 46 % with @entity28 at 43 %			1
the race narrows further -- with @entity27 at 47 % against @entity28 at 45 % -- once undecided voters are asked who they are most likely to support			0
the numbers are troubling for @entity2 because a @entity25 poll just a few days earlier showed @entity27 leading @entity28 50 % to 42 %			1
a @entity39 poll in @entity40 shows the @entity8 race there in a dead heat , with democrat @entity43 and @entity29 @entity44 at 47 %			1
that could provide some comfort to @entity2 after a @entity48 poll had @entity44 up by 7 points over the weekend			1
though @entity29 appear on track to take the @entity8 majority for the first time in nearly a decade , polls can be wrong and might miss important shifts in the electorate during the final hours of the election			0
but veteran @entity29 power broker @entity57 told @entity1 's " the lead with @entity61 , " that it was looking good for his side			1
" i think it is more likely than not @entity29 will have a majority in the @entity8 after these elections , but it 's not a certainty , never is in politics , " @entity57 said			1
" people should n't take things for granted			0
" @entity71 chair @entity70 however said her party 's superior get - out - the - vote operation would be the difference maker			1
" we are going to hold the @entity8 tomorrow night			0
we have , going into election day , a superior ground game that has run circles around the @entity29 , " she told @entity61			0
emotions are running high among exhausted candidates , who are throwing everything into their last hours of campaigning			1
@entity8 candidate @entity84 , a @entity43 , vowed not to give up , despite polls showing her well behind @entity86 , the man in line to become the next @entity8 majority leader			1
" you are the messengers that @entity86 ca n't buy , " @entity84 said in a campaign rally sunday , her voice cracking with emotion			1
" and i tell you , this strong independent @entity95 woman , i 've got kick still in me			0
" @entity1 's @entity97 reported at the weekend that @entity29 strategists have already told @entity99 that things are looking so good that he will indeed be the next majority leader			2
democrats might not be giving up but they know the wind is in their face			1
@entity29 need a net gain of six seats to pick up the @entity8 in an election in which they are also likely to pad their majority in the @entity108			0
the @entity29 is expected to cruise to victory in @entity2 seats in @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , which would leave them just three seats short of a majority			0
and latest polls show the @entity29 leading in @entity2 - held seats in @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
democrats , however , hold the advantage in @entity125			2
to have any hope of halting the @entity29 tide , @entity2 would have to come from behind in several seats on the @entity29 hit list and push races in @entity131 and @entity132 into run - offs			2
the party is insisting that its vaunted get - out - the - vote operation will make things much closer on tuesday than they seem now			2
@entity29 are making the election a referendum on the increasingly unpopular president @entity141			2
the @entity29 would use @entity8 control to make him a lame duck during his last two years in power			0
buy if they do win the @entity8 , @entity29 will fall short of the 60 seat supermajority that they would need to thwart @entity2 delaying tactics			0
and they also know they have a tough map of @entity8 seats to defend in 2016 â € ” a presidential election year in which @entity2 turnout is likely to be higher			0
so they may have an incentive to show they can govern or to compromise with @entity141 in some areas like tax reform or trade deals			0
the votes have not yet been counted in this election , but the next @entity161 race effectively begins on wednesday morning			0
likely candidates on both sides are hitting the @entity8 battlegrounds â € ” and boosting their own prospects in 2016			2
@entity167 's @entity166 gov. @entity166 is wrapping up his campaign marathon that has seen him hit 10 states since friday			2
he is in @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity26 on monday			2
another @entity29 with 2016 in his sights -- sen. @entity174 -- is making seven stops with @entity99 in @entity95			0
@entity176 , who two years ago lost the presidency to @entity141 , travels to @entity121 to give @entity29 @entity8 candidate @entity178 a last minute boost			0
and @entity180 will cap his own long campaign swing with an event with @entity2 gubernatorial candidate @entity183 in @entity184 â € ” a swing state that will see a lot of his wife @entity187 , in her presumed presidential run .			0
