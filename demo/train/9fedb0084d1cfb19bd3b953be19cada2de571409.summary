the website @entity0 has been called a lot of things since @entity4 , a bond trader - turned - photographer , launched the popular photo series almost three years ago			1
what it 's not , he says , is a photography blog -- a collection focused just on the images or shooting technique			1
" the people and their unique stories make the pictures interesting			2
on their own , they would n't have the same impact , " @entity4 , 29 , said in a phone interview this week from his home and studio in @entity19			1
from there , two assistants help him post and maintain the social media accounts he uses to share his diverse images of @entity25			2
check out @entity26 , @entity28 's photography blog @entity4 , who grew up outside @entity29 , says he has refined his approach to focus on storytelling in the few years since @entity0 took off on @entity32			1
it 's a formula that seems to work no matter where he goes			1
@entity4 is best known for his images of people from the streets of @entity25 , but some of the work of which he 's most proud comes from a trip to @entity41 in 2012			1
people often remarked upon how his images " soften " and " humanize " the tough image of @entity25 , " so i thought what would it be like to apply that effect to a place that is feared , " @entity4 said			1
now , about 50,000 of the website 's 1.5 million @entity50 followers are from @entity41 , he says			1
@entity52 : carnage and the catwalk , in photos this week , his first book of images , " @entity0 , " was published			1
here 's an edited transcript of a conversation about the book , his rise to fame and what else has changed in the three years since he began to look at his fellow @entity25 in a different way			1
@entity28 : how did the book come about ? @entity4 : whenever you get a large body of work like @entity0 , a natural pathway becomes to put it between two covers			1
i wanted this to be a very nice keepsake			0
a lot of work went into it , and a lot of fans are attached to it			2
i wanted the book to be a piece of art and not just a cost effective way of repackaging the material for mass consumption			2
@entity28 : how has your approach changed since you began ? @entity4 : the approach to the concept started out purely as photography blog			1
in the first year , i was just taking pictures without captions			2
then i started having interactions in streets , and they were evolving to the point where now i ca n't call it a photography blog because the storytelling is so vital			0
the approach to the work has changed in that way			0
@entity28 : how do you approach people ? @entity4 : my approach is something that has evolved after getting rejected dozens of times			1
i say as little as possible now			0
i do n't explain the blog up front unless they ask			0
i just kindly ask for people 's photos , and if they ask what it 's for i explain the blog to them			0
it 's easy to over-explain yourself , and it 's not really the words you say -- it 's about the energy you give off			0
it took me a long time to learn that			0
i was always looking for the right way to explain myself , but it 's about how calm you are and how genuine you are			0
now , i try to be as natural as possible			0
@entity28 : are you still eating cat food and living on very little , as you told @entity32 last year ? @entity4 : i 'm no longer eating cat food			1
i 've moved up to high - quality dog food			0
i 'm no longer scrambling to pay my rent every month			0
i still have a roommate , and i live in ( @entity135 ) , and though nothing in @entity25 is cheap , it 's relatively inexpensive			0
i enjoy my lifestyle now , but i have no need to upgrade			0
the book deal is not substantial in the book world , but it 's substantial in terms of my life			1
i have two book deals , one for ( this week ) and then a children 's book called " @entity147 " ( due out next year )			1
@entity28 : how do you make money ? there are no ads on your @entity32 , obviously			1
@entity4 : i did one big commercial job			2
i 've turned down tons of jobs from pharmaceutical companies , alcohol , credit cards , but i did extensive commercial work for @entity159 , nine days in seven different cities			0
but i did n't announce it on the blog			0
i emphasized to them that i would not be promoting or advertising it on @entity0			2
i will do work as a photographer but will not rent out @entity0			1
@entity28 : what are some of your favorites ? @entity4 : i always have a hard time answering that			2
any @entity0 picture in isolation ( does n't ) give the feel of the project			2
the feel of the project is the scope			0
a friend of mine said it 's all about the slow burn , it 's all about me getting out there each day and approaching people and putting together a huge spectrum of people			0
that 's what makes it special rather than any technical proficiency or any single shot .			0
