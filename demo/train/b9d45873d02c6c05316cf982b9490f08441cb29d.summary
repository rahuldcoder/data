-- @entity1 has seen quite a turnaround			2
a few years ago , @entity4 's national carrier was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy for a second time in a decade , and at the end of 2011 it reported a $ 60 million loss			2
after a year - long shakeup , however , the once - turbulent company has seen a dramatic rise in profits , and its end - of - year earnings for 2012 were $ 8 million ( the first time the company had turned a profit in five years )			1
@entity17 , the company 's ceo , attributes the upturn to his " @entity21 - style " approach			1
in a recent issue of the airline 's in - flight magazine , he wrote : " full - service , established airlines like @entity1 have to be especially flexible and nimble to avoid becoming the great - uncle launching into a twist at the wedding , whilst the youngsters go ' gangnam '			1
" in other words , @entity1 realized it had to learn new moves , or , as @entity17 clarifies , " get off the dance floor			1
" one of the carrier 's most prominent restructuring methods is adding 109 more seats to five new @entity38 , and introducing a new premium economy class			1
" i want us to be the leading , premium airline in @entity44 , " says @entity17 , who acknowledges there is stiff competition			1

" people that are on the edge of being able to pay for a business class seat may well move to the premium economy , but our expectation is that it will be more than made up by economy class passengers that buy in ( because they find ) the pricing of a business class too high			1
" another major move is that the airline has started to launch a bigger presence in the @entity71 market , increasing their routes between @entity73 and @entity74 to @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
perhaps the most dramatic change , though , is the addition of a second , low - cost airline , called @entity81 , which the company is billing as its " leisure " service			1
@entity81 employs smaller planes and travels to separate , more vacation - themed destinations than the main carrier			1
" we 're a pretty good brand in the leisure market , though word is that we do well on the business travel - side internationally			0
we look at our business and say , well , we could either abandon ( the leisure - side ) over time , as there will always be an efficient , lower cost producer , or we could get into it in a much more meaningful way			2
" it 's still too early to see what effect these changes will have on @entity1 's bottom line in the long run			0
but the company 's recent profit margins bode well			0
" one year does not a transformation make , " acknowledges @entity17 , " but i 'm really encouraged by the results of last year			0
i will characterize ourselves as a baseball game			0
we are probably in the fifth inning right now of a transformation process			0
" read more : @entity1 flight finds stranded @entity111 yacht the company also faced labor challenges last year with disputes with the airlines ' two largest unions , the @entity115			2
the launch of @entity81 was one point of contention , with airline staff worried about the implications for the safety of their jobs			2
" some of the things ( we implemented ) were a little bit of a shock to the airline , a shock to the system			0
the contracts were all settled and everybody did a great job and went back to work , " he says			0
" otherwise , we would n't be winning awards , " he adds			0
the accolades he refers to include an award for best international airline in @entity44 for three years running in the @entity141			0
the carrier also was named best @entity44 airline for international travel and best @entity44 airline in - flight experience ( as voted on by readers of @entity149 magazine business traveler )			0
as @entity17 points out , @entity1 has a legacy to maintain , and sometimes doing so can be harder than starting from scratch			2
" as significant as it is for an entrepreneur to start a business , it 's a lot tougher to convert a business that has been around for twenty five years , and that 's really what we 're doing now , " he says .			0

in 2012 , @entity1 turned a profit for the first time in five years
@entity17 , the ceo , wrote that the company needed to keep up with the competition by going ' @entity21 '
one major change was introducing premium economy class
the company also started a low - cost airline called @entity81 , which has vacation - oriented routes
