@entity1 's former longtime ruler @entity0 was cleared of charges in a retrial saturday and could soon be released -- a stunning reversal for a man who faced life imprisonment or worse after a revolution toppled him in 2011			1
a @entity8 judge dismissed charges linking @entity0 to the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 revolt and found him not guilty of corruption			1
@entity0 , who ruled @entity1 as president for 29 years , was stoic as his supporters in the courtroom cheered the decision that capped a months - long retrial			1
the 86 - year - old , reclining on a hospital gurney in a defendants ' cage , nodded while fellow defendants kissed him on the head			1
later , he told the country 's @entity27 tv station in a brief phone interview that he " did n't commit anything			1
" " i laughed when i heard the first verdict , " he said of the first trial			2
" when it came to the second verdict , i said i was waiting			2
it would go either way			0
it would n't have made a difference to me either way			2
" prosecutor - general @entity43 will appeal the verdict , @entity1 's government - controlled @entity41 website reported early sunday			1
@entity0 was convicted in 2012 of issuing orders to kill peaceful protesters during the country 's 2011 uprising and was sentenced to life in prison			1
he appealed and was granted a new trial last year			2
also acquitted saturday were @entity0 's former interior minister @entity52 and six of @entity52 's aides , who 'd been accused of being connected to the deaths of 239 protesters as security forces cracked down on them in 2011			1
@entity0 's two sons also were acquitted saturday of corruption			1
@entity0 still has a three - year sentence for a previous conviction for embezzlement , but it was n't immediately clear how much time he 's already been credited with , and therefore when he will be free			1
@entity65 's efforts to reach @entity0 's lawyer @entity66 for comment were n't immediately successful			1
both sides have alleged that @entity0 's trials have been politicized , with supporters arguing he was unfairly vilified and opponents fearing that he 'd be acquitted as memories of the revolution faded			1
his legal fortunes did seem to parallel the political climate -- just last year , @entity76 , the @entity77 who became @entity1 's first democratically elected president , supported a retrial with the backing of his supporters , who argued @entity0 should have received a death sentence rather than life in captivity			1
but @entity76 himself was deposed by the military in july 2013 , as opponents accused him of pursuing an @entity77 agenda at the exclusion of other factions			0
and now the @entity92 revolt that ousted @entity0 has come nearly full circle -- @entity0 appears close to freedom ; @entity76 is jailed , his @entity95 banned ; and @entity76 supporters allege the current government has returned to @entity0 's authoritarian practices			1
explaining the verdict judge @entity100 said he dropped charges against @entity0 because @entity102 did n't have the jurisdiction to try him for the protesters ' deaths			1
the judge said the case that prosecutors initially referred to the court listed only @entity52 and his aides as defendants -- not @entity0 himself			1
but after mass protests pressured the prosecutor general to question @entity0 , a second referral was made to the court , and the two cases were merged into one			1
lawyer @entity117 , who represents the families of 65 slain and injured protesters , said the inclusion of @entity0 in a second referral should have trumped his exclusion in the first			1
" the judge shied away from directly acquitting @entity0 even though he was accused of conspiring with @entity52 , and @entity52 was acquitted , " she said			1
" the judge resorted to formalities instead			0
" ' i want only @entity129 's retribution ' @entity130 , mother of one of the slain 2011 protesters , sat down on a sidewalk outside the court after she heard saturday 's verdicts , praying to @entity129 to deliver justice			0
she broke down in tears , her hands shaking , as she recalled her son @entity139 , who was killed in january 2011 at @entity8 's @entity140 , epicenter of the uprising			2
" i 'm worried my son 's blood would go in vain , " she said			0
" our children 's blood is n't cheap			2
their blood is precious , like any other blood			0
" " i do n't want execution , " she continued			2
" this wo n't bring back my son ... i want only @entity129 's retribution			2
" @entity140 was closed to traffic following saturday 's verdicts			0
one man was killed and nine people were injured as several hundred demonstrators clashed nearby with @entity1 security forces , @entity1 @entity160 spokesman @entity159 told @entity65			1
police fired tear gas and bird shot at the protesters			0
the @entity169 said police were pelted by rocks before the incident escalated			0
the human rights group @entity172 , whose lawyers represented more than 60 civil plaintiffs in the case , said that saturday 's verdict solidified the impunity that it says security forces and their leaders enjoy			2
" justice was dealt another severe blow , " the group said in a news release			0
how it started in january 2011 , throngs of @entity1 filled the streets of @entity8 to decry the country 's poverty , unemployment and repression			1
protesters called for @entity0 to step down but were met by a fierce and often violent government crackdown			1
@entity0 eventually stepped down in 2011			2
that freed up long - supressed @entity77 movements , including the @entity95 , to run for office			0
@entity76 , backed by the @entity95 's @entity197 , became president in june 2012			0
but @entity76 was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule			0
since then , @entity8 's military - installed government has banned the @entity95 , calling it a terrorist group -- an allegation it denies -- and accusing it of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on police and the military			0
many @entity77 and secular activists have been arrested and given lengthy sentences			0
a restrictive protest law and repeated deadly crackdowns on demonstrations followed			0
@entity214 , the general who led @entity76 's ouster , was elected president in may after leaving the military to run for the office			0
not free yet since @entity0 stepped down in february 2011 , the ailing former ruler has appeared in court numerous times on a variety of charges , often wheeled in on a gurney			2
his lawyers say he suffered health problems after his 2011 arrest , including a stroke , and he has served much of his prison time at a military medical facility			0
in may , a @entity8 court sentenced him to three years in prison for embezzlement			0
his sons @entity235 and @entity236 were sentenced to four years each on the same charge			0
all three were convicted of embezzling $ 18 million that was allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces			0
the mubaraks have insisted they are not guilty .			0
