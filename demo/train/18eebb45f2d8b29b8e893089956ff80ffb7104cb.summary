-- @entity1 is taking on one of the world 's biggest internet giants , threatening to sue over something that is not on its maps			1
on state - run @entity8 , the @entity1 regime warns it may take legal action against @entity10 for not labeling the @entity11			1
it 's the latest volley in what one expert calls a " war of words " that has raged for decades over the waterway that borders @entity1 and several @entity19 countries			1
@entity1 previously lashed out against the @entity21 military for calling the waterway the @entity11			1
in a statement thursday , the @entity1 regime accused @entity10 of carrying out efforts of @entity1 's enemies			1
" toying with modern technologies in political issues is among the new measures by the enemies against @entity1 , ( and ) in this regard , @entity10 has been treated as a plaything , " @entity27 spokesman @entity26 said thursday , according to state - run @entity8			1
he added that " omitting the name @entity11 is ( like ) playing with the feelings and realities of the @entity1 nation			1
" on state - run news agency @entity40 , @entity1 officials accused @entity10 of having removed the words " @entity11			1
" but a @entity10 spokesperson told @entity0 the body of water was never labeled			1
" it 's just simply the case that we do n't have a label for every body of water , " the spokesperson said , speaking anonymously on the issue in keeping with company policy			1
the spokesperson would not name any other specific areas that are not labeled			2
if you type " @entity11 " into @entity56 , the resulting map shows you the @entity11 but does not label it			0
nearby bodies of water -- including the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 -- are labeled			1
@entity10 uses the marker " a " to show you whichever location you requested			1
the column to the left of the map does say that the @entity68 is in the " @entity11			0
" anger over the lack of a label on the map has spread not just within @entity1 's government , but among the population and @entity1 living around the world			1
at least nine pages on @entity77 are dedicated to the issue , including " hey @entity10 , put @entity11 back on the map " and " @entity10 for removing @entity11 from the maps			1
" there have also been times that @entity19 complained the waterway should be called the @entity11 , says @entity84 , a professor at the @entity85 who specializes in language and the contemporary @entity19 world			0
" it 's a war of words , " he says			2
" these are symbolic things " and involve " a lot of emotion , " @entity84 said			0
the @entity93 has complained that the term " @entity11 " began " as @entity96 propaganda and was later used by @entity97 to exploit ethnic rivalries in support of his regional ambitions			0
" in 2010 , the @entity101 was bombarded with thousands of angry , @entity103 messages on its @entity77 page			0
the @entity101 responded with its own extensive statement on @entity77			0
" we are aware of the long and proud history of the @entity11 people , " the @entity101 said at the time			0
it added that " @entity11 " is used for its forces , but that in other respects , including nautical charts and publications , " the historic name of @entity11 is used			0
" @entity1 has gone after other groups before for either using the term " @entity11 ' or simply calling it " the gulf			1
" the country banned the @entity118 publication @entity119 once in 2006 for calling the waterway " the @entity11 , " and it launched protests against the @entity123 museum in @entity124 when its guides did the same , the @entity118 newspaper @entity126 reported			0
@entity10 would not say whether it has had direct contact with @entity1 authorities on the issue , nor whether it has received many complaints			1
@entity84 says @entity10 is " boxing clever " -- making a smart move -- by not labeling something controversial			2
" they do n't want to annoy anybody			0
" @entity56 has found itself in controversial terrain before			0
in november 2010 , a @entity138 general cited @entity10 's map of the border with @entity141 to justify a reported raid in a disputed area			1
the dispute over the term " @entity11 " is a reminder that what a place is called can have powerful political repercussions			0
while much of the world refers to the @entity153 nation west of @entity154 as @entity155 , the @entity21 government still calls it @entity155			2
the @entity157 explains that the ruling junta changed the name to @entity155 in 1989 , but some in the democratic opposition do n't recognize the change			0
" out of support for the democratic opposition , and its victory in the 1990 election , the @entity21 government likewise uses ' @entity155 , ' " the @entity157 website says			0
the @entity21 also does not use the name kampuchea , instead calling that country @entity170			0
the @entity157 says the @entity171 turned @entity170 , " which it called @entity174 ( @entity175 ) , " into " a land of horror			2
" in @entity177 , some officials refer to the @entity178 as @entity179 and @entity180 -- biblical references used to highlight @entity183 history on the land and bolster a view that it should be part of modern @entity177			0
in @entity188 , nationalists and unionists have battled for years over whether to call an area @entity190 or @entity190			2
@entity191 and much of @entity192 call the @entity193 the @entity193			2
@entity191 presses claims to the islands 30 years after losing a war with @entity118 over them			0
" you kind of own something if it 's called the way you want it called , " holes , the @entity85 professor said , adding that there is a " kind of a feeling that who you are is tied into issues of how you name things			2

@entity10 tells @entity0 this body of water was never labeled
spats over naming have *cropped* up from " @entity193 " to " @entity190 " to " @entity174 "
@entity1 's @entity27 says @entity10 is being used by the nation 's enemies
