-- manliness , metaphorically embodied these days by facial hair , grilling meat and building domestic " man caves , " is now carving its own space online			0
the line of what is and is n't masculine is blurring , whether it is through manscaping , as shown in @entity11 's new documentary " @entity15 " or barbecue chefs such as @entity13 expertly wielding tongs			2
this trend may be rightly celebrated for breaking gender stereotypes			0
but as the " mantuary " for hanging with the bros gets invaded by scented candles , some entrepreneurs are fighting back with new websites that cater to stereotypically manly interests such as cars , sports , tech toys and bachelor living			1
they have names such as @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , and they claim to target the male demographic not just in content but also in utilization			0
they 've all launched in the past six months , and their inspiration appears to be the skyrocketing popularity of @entity41 , a virtual pinboard where users post , or " pin , " images of their favorite things			1
unlike @entity41 , however , these sites have fewer photos of wedding dresses and more pics of beards , babes , guns , harleys and bottles of whiskey			1
@entity41 has more than 20 million users , and a survey last spring found they spend more time there per month than users of any other social network except @entity62 and @entity63			1
considering those numbers , and that @entity41 has been valued at $ 1.5 billion , and it 's no surprise that similar websites such as @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 have popped up			1
but @entity41 and its copycat sites are largely populated by women			1
a february survey by @entity72 found that women comprise 83 % of @entity41 users			1
a quick browse through its most popular pins and its about section ( " people use pinboards to plan their weddings , decorate their homes and organize their favorite recipes " ) seems to reinforce this gender imbalance			0
@entity84 : @entity85 on why @entity41 is 2012 's hottest website @entity86 , co-founder of @entity87 , said that when he first played around with his fiancee 's @entity41 account , he appreciated the concept			1
" i loved what it did and i loved the features , but i did n't like the content , " he said			0
" the content is not geared towards a guy			0
i am not interested in cupcakes or puppies			0
but i am interested in cars and gadgets			2
" @entity84 : interest , meet @entity41 : site helps users catalog their passions not that there are n't any men pinning			1
but @entity106 , co-founder of @entity107 , said that when his online men 's magazine started using @entity41 , they noticed that there was n't a strong male presence			1
" there 's still that perception that it is a female - centric site , " he said			2
' @entity117 ' alternatives enter sites such as @entity31			2
" we were thinking of mimicking the [ @entity41 ] business concept but catering to the male demographic , " said @entity119 , who co-founded manteresting with @entity120			1
" @entity124 , we are intentional in our naming of our website			0
we needed to be divisive			0
" while @entity128 has managed to rack up more than 2 million page views since it started in february , the plan is not to declare war against @entity41 , @entity119 said			1
so what makes up a manly image bookmarking website ? let 's start with the look			1
@entity128 's layout swaps @entity41 's cursive red title on a cream background with a black , block - letter title and the tag " @entity140 " on a dark steel background			1
@entity34 goes for a dark navy blue with white lettering , and @entity33 opts for an elegant black - and - white theme with a moustachioed logo			0
then there 's the testosterone - laden choice of words			2
instead of " pin it , " users on these websites can " nail it " ( @entity31 ) , " @entity154 " ( @entity87 ) and " @entity155 " ( @entity33 )			2
@entity157 ' slogans are " dudes like sharing stuff " and " @entity160			0
" the founders of @entity31 , @entity87 and @entity33 were all quick to say that they do n't emphasize photos of women in bikinis or tolerate offensive content			2
their most popular image subjects range from food to technology to sports to memes to bachelor pads , they said			1
embracing stereotypes ? @entity173 , co-founder of @entity33 -- " a mint of manly things " -- said he felt no pressure to set a certain bar for manliness			2
" how do we know what 's manly ? we really do n't , " he said			1
" there is no editorial guideline , so people interpret it their own way			0
" each site embraces " manliness " in a different way			0
@entity87 prides itself as " a guy 's night out " and pairs you up with similar users during registration			1
it also has a " challenges " section where users are asked to dart images in response to a challenge like finding " something @entity199 can not defeat			2
" @entity128 gives you the option to " bump " or " shame " an image to the " @entity205 " or " @entity206 " sections of the site			0
@entity33 has " collections " that allow users to group images in whatever form they like as opposed to categorizing them			2
@entity107 's @entity106 believes men share content differently than women and are more likely to share that which is representative of stereotypical male interests			1
" it 's more about what your stuff says about you , " he said			2
" the sharing is very much in line with what society dictates to us			0
if a guy talks about calorie counting , he will be ostracized			0
" @entity106 warns that the content on these niche websites could perpetuate stereotypes about what men are interested in			2
@entity236 's @entity235 also mocked the idea of " @entity41 for men " in a recent article and suggested men are threatened by the female - dominated website			1
" why do we need these sad virtual man caves ? " he wrote			0
" get over yourselves , dudes			0
maybe you 'll even learn a little about closet organizing			0
" @entity31 's @entity119 says his team has been accused of being " homophobic or misogynistic or sexist			0
" but he points out that @entity31 has no restrictions against women joining , and that his site 's 45,000 images of bacon doughnuts , basement game rooms and movie posters offer proof that there is a market for such content			1
@entity86 of @entity87 says his site has received invite requests from women and that they are more than welcome to join			0
" but we said from the start , this is a service that guys will like , " he said			0
more men on @entity41 this raises a question : would it be so terrible if @entity41 remains dominated by women and female - oriented content ? @entity271 , a staff writer at @entity272 , wrote in a recent article that @entity41 's gender gap reveals how " conservative ideas about gender find themselves reproduced online			1
" but she believes that may not be such a bad thing			0
" within a seemingly tame array of cute animals and wedding ideas , nearly 20 years into web culture , we have nevertheless somehow managed to create something formidable -- at long last , the @entity286 's first true woman - centric blockbuster , " she wrote			0
last week , @entity287 wrote on @entity289 's culture blog that she fears @entity41 's founders might " push the flowers off screen " because " women 's interests are coming on ' a little strong ' for an @entity295 , " she said			1
she later added , " we should be long past women 's clubs , but if @entity41 remains one , let it be the men 's loss			1
" the scales of gender balance might already be leveling			0
a recent @entity301 slide show featured men with hundreds of thousands of followers on @entity41			1
and according to @entity72 , a data visualization community , 56 % of @entity41 users in the @entity305 are men			1
@entity106 predicts that @entity41 is in a pre-evolutionary stage , just as " @entity63 was once considered for college students			1
" the bookmarking site may attract a more balanced group of users once it tweaks its branding , he says			2
" there will always be places to be gender - specific , " he said			0
" there will always be the [ male ] equivalent of @entity41			2
but the beauty of the @entity319 is you can never stop anyone else from joining			0
the medium does n't allow it			0
" what do you think ? do you find @entity41 too " girly " or do you think it is fine the way it is ? should @entity41 become more gender neutral ? would you use these manly alternatives ? let us know in the comments .			1

one recent survey found that 83 % of @entity41 users are women
that 's created a niche for new " manly " visual bookmarking sites
these sites cater to interests such as cars , sports , tech toys and bachelor living
