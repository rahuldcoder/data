-- in the many media stories about the @entity1 , much of the focus has rightly been on the thousands of foreign fighters @entity1 has attracted , its brutal tactics and its robust social media presence			1
but an arguably even more important development has not received the attention it deserves : the group 's widening influence across the @entity12 world , driven by the numerous terrorist and insurgent organizations that have recently sworn loyalty to it			1
in the past six months , @entity1 has drawn into its fold some dozen groups from @entity19 to @entity20			1
@entity22 , in contrast , had been in existence for a decade before it recruited its first affiliate , @entity25 's @entity24 , in 1998			0
and , in its 2Â½ - decade existence , @entity22 has only manged to add some half dozen affiliates , one of which was @entity22 in @entity29 , the parent organization of @entity1 that has now split off from the core @entity22 organization			1
indeed , just this week , an @entity1 delegation met with leaders of a splinter group of the @entity20 @entity36 to talk about how to unify @entity20 militants , the @entity32 reported			2
also this month , @entity39 , one of the most violent militant groups in @entity25 , pledged allegiance to @entity1 , the @entity38 reported			1
@entity39 is believed to have been responsible for an attack on a police checkpoint near @entity45 last month that killed 30 @entity25 soldiers			0
and @entity1 has continued to expand its geographical reach			2
three other groups -- @entity48 in the @entity49 , @entity50 in @entity51 and @entity52 in @entity53 -- also recorded statements of allegiance to @entity1 in november , which @entity1 broadcast online			1
meanwhile , @entity1 now controls the eastern @entity51 city of @entity58 , not far from the @entity25 border			2
and last month , six @entity20 @entity36 leaders reportedly swore allegiance to @entity1 in an audio message , although @entity63 , the @entity20 @entity36 's official spokesman , said he was speaking for himself and five other @entity36 leaders in the message , not for the rest of the @entity20 @entity36			2
the @entity36 reacted by firing @entity63 , but a senior @entity36 official told the @entity68 that " he was the most important of the five who have left us " and said that the leaders had defected because they were unhappy with senior @entity36 leaders			0
among other groups that have pledged allegiance to @entity1 is @entity76 ( soldiers of the @entity78 ) , a terrorist group operating in @entity19			1
previously , the group was part of @entity22 's @entity82 branch , @entity81 , until the group split from @entity81 because it was " deviating from the true path			0
" and just 10 days after proclaiming its allegiance to @entity1 , @entity76 beheaded @entity86 , a 55 - year - old @entity87 hiker they had taken hostage			2
( beheading @entity91 hostages is , of course , one of @entity1 ' signature tactics )			0
inside @entity95 and @entity29 , @entity1 has also gathered up smaller militant groups			1
for example , @entity97 , a former @entity22 - linked group , is now cooperating with @entity1			0
also , @entity99 ( @entity100 ) used to work to repel @entity102 forces from @entity29 and has now joined the ranks of @entity1			0
finally , @entity1 and the @entity22 - aligned @entity104 had previously been at war with each other in @entity95 for much of this past year			1
but this month , representatives from the two groups met in @entity95 and agreed to stop fighting each other and focus on fighting their common enemies , sources told @entity32			0
this brings together the two most effective @entity114 militant groups fighting in @entity95			0
why are all of these militant groups suddenly pledging their allegiance to @entity1 or aligning themselves with the group , and in many cases giving up former affiliations with @entity22 's core group to do so ? the answer is simple : @entity1 is successful			1
in many ways it really is the " @entity1 " that it claims to be , because it has taken large portions of both countries from government control , replacing local administrators with @entity1 governors who distribute social services			0
@entity1 is also winning critical cities and key points of infrastructure , including dams and oil wells , and that means the group has substantial funding and resources at its disposal			0
partnering with @entity1 makes sense from an economic perspective for many of these organizations , especially the smaller militant groups operating inside @entity95 and @entity29			1
for other militant groups around the @entity12 world , it allows for a cross-pollination of ideas and training through a sort of jihadist exchange program , where some groups send members into @entity95 or @entity29 to learn from @entity1			1
@entity1 controls territory in a 400 - mile swath from @entity156 in the west of @entity95 to @entity158 in the east , near the @entity29 capital , @entity161 , while its dozen or so affiliated organizations stretch from the coast of @entity82 to the mountains of the @entity165			2
the fact is that @entity22 's core organization can only dream of such success .			0
