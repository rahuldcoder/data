-- a former @entity2 military officer who fought against ex-leader @entity4 's troops last year was picked to head the country 's armed forces , a move that comes as tensions flare among rival militias			1
the interim @entity10 chose @entity11 to be chief of staff of the country 's armed forces tuesday			1
@entity11 was a member of @entity2 's special forces and had been retired for years			1
he worked as a field commander in the battles against @entity4 's battalions in february			1
he was arrested in @entity18 in april by @entity4 forces			1
born in @entity20 in 1950 , he enrolled in military school in 1970 and specialized in anti-armor weaponry			2
he worked in different locations in @entity2 and fought in @entity2 's war in @entity25 , which ended in the 1980s			0
@entity11 was also a lecturer and instructor in @entity2 's military school			1
@entity28 , an associate professor of government and an expert on @entity2 at @entity31 , said he believes the government was looking for a top military figure who can " straddle difficulties " and ' bridge the gap " between different groups			1
" my hunch is this is a compromise more than anyone else , " he said			0
four people died in clashes tuesday in @entity2 's capital between militias from @entity45 and @entity46 , officials said			2
the clashes were over control of a building that previously housed an intelligence center under @entity4 , said col. @entity50 , a spokesman for the @entity51			1
however , former rebels in @entity45 provided different , and conflicting , accounts of what caused the fighting -- meaning the motivations behind it remain unclear			0
@entity58 , director of the program on @entity60 at the @entity61 , noted reports that @entity11 has ties to @entity46			2
militias have a strong presence in @entity46 , where fighting raged during last year 's war between @entity4 forces and rebels			1
he said @entity11 's appointment " suggests or confirms just how bad and how dire the critical situation is regarding the militias			1
" he said the government is n't making headway on disarming militias and it is covering bases geographically to win over the loyalties of militia members and inspire confidence in the central government			1
" his selection is reflective of the government 's attempt to improve the situation , to encourage a process of disarmament , " he said about @entity11			1
@entity86 , a lecturer in international affairs and political science at @entity89 , sees the choice as " partially an attempt to reduce fighting between militias			2
" he says it 's " significant " that he has links to @entity46			0
" one could read that as being a sign to appease some of the militias that are from the area , " @entity86 said			2
" there is probably a calculation going on that he might be better able to bring some militias into the fold of a national army and reduce the factional fighting going on right now			2
" it 's not the first time rival militias have clashed since the war ended , a possible reflection of mutual distrust that could pose a challenge to the nation 's new leadership			0
in november , dozens of fighters clashed at a @entity45 hospital in what residents said was the biggest armed confrontation in the city since the country was declared liberated			0
while there were no deaths from gunshots , medical staff said three patients at the hospital died of stress - related causes linked to the fighting			0
in december , government officials met to discuss the infighting			0
residents of many @entity2 cities , especially @entity45 , are increasingly frustrated , with their streets awash with weapons and armed men who do not answer to a central command			0
former fighters complained to @entity0 about a lack of jobs and support from the @entity10			0
interim government officials have said they will help freedom fighters and incorporate them into the security forces			0
@entity0 's @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this report .			0

@entity11 had been in the military under @entity4
there have been deadly clashes among militias
one *analyst* says the government wants to win over loyalties of militia members
