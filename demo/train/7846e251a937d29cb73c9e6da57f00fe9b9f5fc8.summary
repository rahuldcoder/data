-- a study finds that air pollution from @entity3 directly affects the storm pattern over the @entity5			1
researchers further speculate that this could be driving freak winter weather in @entity9			1
" the @entity5 storm track is a major driving force over global weather patterns , " says the study 's lead author @entity10 , a post-doctorate fellow at the @entity14 @entity13 @entity12			1
" the modulated storm track can be linked to abnormal weather behavior in the mid-latitudes of the @entity21 , including @entity13 and @entity22			1
" results from the decade - long research project were recently published in the @entity25 ( @entity25 )			0
smog central reports of high levels of air pollution regularly emerge from the @entity3 region			2
in january , the @entity31 in @entity32 recorded hazardous levels of particulate matter in the @entity37 capital 's air , at 18 times the recommended amount by the @entity39			0
residents were warned to stay indoors			0
around the same time , a report by @entity42 and @entity43 sparked debate on whether @entity46 capital @entity45 had worse pollution than @entity32			0
now , @entity10 and his fellow researchers say pollution in these @entity3 cities is becoming a global problem			2
fossil fuel burning and petrochemical processing in @entity3 's rapidly developing economies lead to a build - up of aerosols , fine particles suspended in the air			1
typically , aerosol formation is thought of as the antithesis to global warming : it cools our @entity63 's climate			0
but researchers say , too much of any one thing is never good			0
" aerosols provide seeds for cloud formation			2
if you provide too many seeds , then you fundamentally change cloud patterns and storm patterns , " says co-author of the study , @entity76 , a professor of atmospheric sciences at @entity78 in @entity79			1
from east to west the study , which looked at simulated climate models using data from the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , shows that aerosols from @entity3 are transported to the @entity5 and intensifying the storm track there			1
although the results only show the impact specifically on the @entity5 region , researchers theorize that the full effect reaches around the globe			0
" we are observing the mid-latitude cyclone system , which transports heat and moisture from low to high latitudes			0
if this system is changed by air pollution from @entity3 , then global heat distribution will also be changed			2
we can expect that weather patterns over other parts of the world can be affected , " says lead author @entity10			0
co-author @entity76 further agrees that it is " very possible " that abnormal weather such as extremely cold winters in the @entity13 are driven by @entity3 pollution			2
the experts will conduct more research to assess the full global impact of @entity3 pollution , including creating more climate models , monitoring storm patterns by satellite , and conducting measurements in the atmosphere .			1

particles in the air known as aerosols are *responsible* for cloud formation
more aerosols *blowing* in from @entity3 to the @entity5 means intensifying storm patterns , says new study
