i 'm sitting in the lounge car of a train and traveling at a fairly ordinary speed			2
but this is no ordinary train : the back end of the carriage is a giant floor - to - ceiling window , like a flickering movie screen on which the passing landscapes are acting out their various parts			1
there are volcanoes being majestic , and hills cloaked in forests of cypress trees and bamboo			0
there are rice fields shimmering with green and a shoreline of bays filled with boats and seaweed farms , which unravels as the train goes past			2
moreover , every landscape has at least a couple of people in it , waving			0
i wave back -- when i remember -- but i 'm a bit busy			0
my wine glass is being refilled			0
behind me , by the bar , a gifted violin - and - piano duo is tackling everything from @entity33 to @entity34 , and they 're asking for requests			2
and on the table in front of me is a selection of amuse - bouches either wrapped in leaves , or served on delicate porcelain or in bamboo boxes ; mouthfuls of locally - sourced beef , wood - smoked fish , pungent sea urchin , plus of course fugu -- the fish that needs to be cooked by a highly trained and licensed chef , or you 're dead			2
exclusive and luxurious i 'm in @entity53 , a country famous for its trains , but generally not the sort that allow their passengers to savor their surroundings like this one does			1
@entity61 , the country 's bullet trains , for example , have a fuselage - like interior which pays little heed to anything in its haste to get from one end of country to the other			1
but now @entity71 have invested big money -- over $ 34 million -- into a special train with the deliberate aim of going slow			1
this chocolate liveried locomotive chugs along the branch lines , truffling out local delicacies and hot springs , and giving locals cause to stop their planting and harvesting in order to stare and wave			1
the " @entity94 in @entity95 " is @entity53 's answer to the @entity86 , with its seven carriages having space for just 30 people in 14 suites ; and it is very exclusive , with some 21 applications for every berth			1
the interiors around me are examples of the best in @entity53 craftsmanship : walls are of rosewood and maple , floors are made from walnut , window coverings are shoji paper screens , sliding glass doors are etched with flowers and birds			1
volcanoes and hot springs part of the train 's purpose is to " introduce @entity95 to the world , " according to the @entity117 company , because @entity53 's third largest island is not a first - timer 's destination			1
@entity95 is the most southwesterly main island in the chain , which means it is the warmest and most tropically lush , with more than its fair share of volcanoes and spas			1
so within a few hours of setting off from capital @entity129 on our four - day itinerary , we 've already got into hot water -- or more specifically , our feet have , into a mineral water footspa on the station platform at @entity135 , in a valley filled with plumes of rising steam			1
the journey here has been up through hill country , ambushing rivers , clattering across iron bridges , scything through rice terracing spiced with hurricane lilies -- crimson wildflowers that look like splashes of blood amongst the yellowing harvest			0
at the station , we are met by the @entity152 luxury bus , which is to shadow us throughout our journey , ready to pounce whenever needed			2
this time it takes us to a tea - house in ornamental gardens where we try " plum pudding " -- actually a sort of sorbet with a plum at the center			0
fast forward a day , and the landscape has changed completely			0
the train has rumbled south to the coastal city of @entity165 , where @entity166 looms , puffing out clouds of ash			0
i ca n't believe how calm the locals are , living in the shadow of an active volcano			0
this used to be samurai territory and the bus whisks us off to a clan center to learn about how @entity53 , dominated by shoguns , was almost completely cut off from the outside world until 1867			1
even now , it has n't quite abandoned the old ways , for while our first night was spent slumbering in a rural siding on the train , for our second night the bus transfers us to the @entity188 ryokan , a traditional travelers ' inn in a hot springs resort an hour inland from @entity165			1
this ryokan turns out to be a rustic collection of low - beamed cottages threaded by cobbled pathways , with dinner prepared over charcoal using ingredients from the garden			0
my room has sweet - smelling tatami - matting floors , and i plan to sleep on the balcony overlooking the river until i return from dinner to find that the bed fairies have been at work , magicking a linen - covered futon out onto the sleeping room floor			2
i do n't ignore the balcony , however , because this is where i have my own personal onsen			0
luxuriating in my own floating world , contemplating the evening light filtering through the trees , it is easy to see the sense in this change of scene away from the @entity94 : the proper savoring of hot springs is a very @entity53 experience , and not one that should be curtailed by the timetable of even the most handsome of trains			1
need to know info : the @entity94 offers two itineraries : a two - day option which stays around @entity129 , or a four - day journey which does a loop of the island			2
both are hugely in demand , so the company selects applications by lottery			0
the starting price of $ 4,200 per person ( based on two sharing ) covers all accommodation , transport , sightseeing , food and drink			0
@entity238 has direct flights to @entity241 capitals such as @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 with carriers @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 , and direct to @entity249 with @entity250 to @entity251			0
