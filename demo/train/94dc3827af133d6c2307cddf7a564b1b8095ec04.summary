@entity0 -- the smell of exhaust from idling cars fills up the @entity6 parking lot			1
congressional aides have their engines revved -- ready to whisk their bosses to train stations and airports as soon as they cast their last vote			1
it 's a familiar scene when @entity14 is getting ready to leave town , especially for an extended period			1
but this time the race for a six - week respite feels different			1
there is bipartisan consensus that the @entity21 is now at war with @entity23 and that @entity14 should be a part of the decision - making process on how to deal with that , by passing a new authorization for military force			1
@entity29 : @entity21 has proven it ca n't win an @entity31 land war without @entity31 but @entity14 took off to go campaign full time to try to keep their jobs rather than staying to do their jobs			1
" there is broad agreement in the country that this @entity23 group is a threat , " rep. @entity36 , @entity37 , told @entity1			1
" so why not stay and debate it and not go home if your constituents believe it 's a threat ? " we asked			0
" i do n't disagree , " @entity36 replied			0
" i 'm prepared to vote yes			2
so i 'm not ducking any vote			2
" " it 's ridiculous , " rep. @entity50 , @entity51 , said a few minutes later			0
" as if there is not enough to do and it 's not just the war issues , it 's immigration reform , @entity54 ( @entity54 ) -- it 's a number of different bills that have been filed that have bipartisan support , " @entity50 said			0
it is true that rank - and - file @entity65 members , especially those like @entity36 and @entity50 who are in the minority party , do n't have much choice but to follow the schedule leaders lay out			1
still , as we weaved through the slew of waiting cars to talk to lawmakers before they left , it was striking -- but not surprising -- the way blame was tossed around			1
republicans blamed the @entity78 - controlled @entity77			1
" the problem is that we have a do - nothing @entity77 , " sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , said			2
republicans also blamed the president			2
rep. @entity83 , @entity84 , said he 'd be glad to vote for a new use - of - force authorization against @entity23			1
" i wish the president would ask for one , " @entity83 said			0
@entity87 : @entity23 threat against @entity21 , allies ' does n't frighten us ' democrats noted that leaving now has become a tradition to help the @entity65 , where @entity76 are a majority			1
" @entity65 runs every two years , and for many , many years the @entity65 has adjourned for the month of october			0
" @entity95 sen. @entity94 of @entity96 said			1
some senators were openly appalled that colleagues were heading home			1
freshman sen. @entity100 , @entity101 , had publicly urged her colleagues to stay , to no avail			2
" we need to be here we need to debate this issue , " @entity100 told us			0
sen. @entity107 , @entity108 , is on the ballot in november , but hers is a safe seat			0
going home to campaign is not her first priority			2
" my job is to be in the @entity6 working for the people of @entity119 and the @entity21 people and that 's where i think we all belong now , " said @entity114 , standing in the @entity6 parking lot , pointing to the dome			0
sen. @entity124 , @entity101 - @entity125 , who won his big primary fight earlier this year and should face an easy reelection in november , had a trademark pithy synopsis			2
" we seem to be more worried about who runs the place than how the place runs , " he said			0
ultimately , all the lawmakers who complained and called it important to stay got in their cars and left , too			0
there 's no reason to stay -- there are no more votes until after the election			0
fresh act : 87 - year - old felon @entity143 wants back in			0
@entity1 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0

@entity14 leaves @entity0 to campaign full - time , with no vote yet on @entity23
