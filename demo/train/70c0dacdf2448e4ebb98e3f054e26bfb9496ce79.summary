-- if you took a moment during the heat of the presidential race to drop by the @entity6 campaign office , you would have been shocked by the number of white people working to get him elected			1
about the only color you would have seen were the red and white in the @entity12 posters			0
if you met with @entity6 's senior campaign team -- the decision makers -- you would have said major corporations in @entity16 have more diversity on their boards of directors than these guys			1
at a @entity6 campaign event , followers of mine on @entity23 always played the " do - you - know - that - one - black - person - who - is - always - standing - behind - @entity6 - with - a - sign " game			2
seeing someone black , @entity28 or @entity29 at a @entity6 campaign rally was always a sight to behold			2
so why in the world is @entity6 now largely blaming minorities for the butt - kicking administered to him by president @entity34 ? politics : @entity36 slams @entity6 for ' gifts ' comment about minorities , young voters in a conference call with donors , @entity6 attributed his loss to the president playing @entity44 by showering minorities and young voters with " gifts " -- health care , student loans and those things @entity16 clearly do n't need			1
" the @entity34 campaign was following the old playbook of giving a lot of stuff to groups that they hoped they could get to vote for them and be motivated to go out to the polls , specifically the @entity61 - @entity60 community , the @entity28 community and young people , " @entity6 said during the conference call			1
" in each case they were very generous in what they gave to those groups			0
" opinion : democrats , do n't get too cocky hey , black people , @entity6 reveals what you got for your vote ! " with regards to @entity60 voters , ' @entity75 ' was a huge plus -- and was highly motivational to @entity60 voters			2
you can imagine for somebody making $ 25 - , or $ 30 - , or $ 35,000 a year , being told ' you 're now going to get free health care ' -- particularly if you do n't have it , getting free health care worth , what , $ 10,000 a family , in perpetuity -- i mean this is huge			0
likewise with @entity28 voters , free health care was a big plus			0
" hey , hispanic people , what did @entity34 have for you behind door no. 2 ? " the amnesty for the children of illegals -- the so - called @entity97 kids -- was a huge plus for that voting group			2
on the negative side , of course , they always characterized us as being anti-immigrant , being tough on illegal immigration , and so forth , so that was very effective with that group			0
" @entity36 : how @entity106 can win future elections wow , thanks , @entity6 , for breaking that down for us ! now it 's time for a dose of reality from the black guy to the white guy , @entity6			1
@entity6 , last i checked , the @entity75 is for all @entity16			1
the white ones too ! your effort to portray the health care law as nothing more than a freebie to the blacks is a joke			0
the @entity97 for kids could largely be seen as helping @entity125 , but there are some white folks and people of @entity61 descent mixed into the pot that makes up those in the country illegally , so you 're again off base			0
but @entity6 , you need to check your facts and realize that there were a lot of white people who really did n't like you			2
opinion : republicans lost the culture war according to exit polls , 72 % of all @entity16 voters were white			1
that 's a super majority			0
@entity6 , you got 59 % of those voters			1
that 's a big number , but you must understand that you might have wanted to appeal to more than just white voters to win			2
when you give one speech to the @entity152 and only one interview with a black media outlet , @entity155 -- son , that 's not gon na cut it			0
but the most hilarious thing to see is how many of the whitest states in @entity16 the white guy lost to the black guy			2
see , if you accept @entity6 's theory that minorities were a prime reason he lost , then he should have cleaned up in the @entity167 in those really , really , really white states			1
let 's take a look : @entity172 , 94 % white : @entity34 @entity174 , 94 % white : @entity34 @entity176 , 92 % white : @entity34 @entity178 , 93 % white : @entity6 @entity180 , 88 % white : @entity34 @entity182 , 88 % white : @entity6 @entity184 , 85 % white : @entity6 @entity186 , 83 % white : @entity6 @entity188 , 82 % white : @entity6 @entity190 , 81 % white : @entity34 @entity192 , 80 % white : @entity6 that means of 11 really , really , really white states , @entity34 won five and @entity6 won six			1
so @entity6 , if it 's just about those minorities , what happened ? this is why @entity6 should n't have been president			1
he ca n't accept reality , and his judgment on his loss is more than suspect			0
even @entity205 gov. @entity36 , a fellow @entity106 , had to smack @entity6 for his ignorant comments : " i absolutely reject that notion , " he said			0
" i think that 's absolutely wrong			0
" opinion : how @entity106 can win future elections bottom line , @entity6 : the black guy beat you because he offered a more inclusive message to a cross section of people than you			0
you wanted to protect the richest of the rich in this country , and president @entity34 saw that providing a pathway to college to a wider number of @entity16 , as well as confronting the health crisis we have , was vitally important			1
@entity6 , your message was arrogant and dismissive			0
the " 47 % " comment you made at that @entity228 fundraiser , which you later said was " completely wrong , " was clearly meant in earnest			0
you actually believed what you said			0
you think that minorities and young people are a bunch of victims who just want free stuff , or as you call them , gifts			2
well , @entity6 , @entity16 should be thankful minorities and young people rejected your nonsense			1
we need a president who offers a vision for a more inclusive @entity16 , not one who sees health care , college loans and an initiative to deal with immigration reform as " gifts			1
" @entity248 : did @entity12 's ideas doom @entity6 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			1

@entity252 : @entity6 is largely blaming minorities for his loss to president @entity34
in a talk with donors , @entity6 said @entity34 showered minorities and young voters with " gifts "
exit polls say 72 % of all @entity16 voters were white , and @entity6 received 59 % of their votes
@entity252 : @entity16 should be thankful minorities and young rejected @entity6 's " nonsense "
