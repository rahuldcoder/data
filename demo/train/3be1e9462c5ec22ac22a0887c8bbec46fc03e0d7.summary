-- @entity1 , vice-chairman of @entity2 , caused a stir in the auto industry -- and in the automotive press -- when he announced in january of 2007 that the @entity6 plug - in electric car would be ready for mass production and on the road , by the end of 2010			1
@entity2 has begun driving test models of the @entity6 at its @entity12			1
because he was making this pronouncement at the 2007 @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , -- in conjunction with the unveiling of the volt concept car -- skeptics thought that @entity1 's statement was a bit too optimistic			2
some thought it might be one of those that falls into the category of " speaking more from hope than experience , " and that it was more a rallying cry for the troops than an attainable reality			0
after all , at the time , reliable long - term and cost effective lithium - ion batteries required to power a plug - in electric cars seemed to be years away			1
but now , almost two years later , @entity2 still seems confident that the 2010 launch date will be met			1
and that belief is shared by many who work for some of the auto - biz research institutes / industry associations			2
on september 16 , @entity2 celebrated its 100 - year anniversary celebration at the @entity43 in downtown @entity17 , @entity18 , by unveiling the production version of the volt			1
meanwhile , that same day , @entity2 began driving test models at its @entity12			2
@entity47 autos : hybrid @entity48 @entity2 is n't the only player with plug - in electric cars coming down the pike			1
so far this year , @entity53 has delivered the first two of what will eventually be a fleet of 20 escape plug - in hybrid " research " vehicles to @entity58 , the utility company			1
and in june , @entity53 also dispatched an @entity60 flex - fuel vehicle -- which means it can run on @entity61 -- to the @entity63 @entity62			1
both of those deliveries were for purposes of road - testing the vehicles to see how they perform over the long haul			2
similarly , @entity71 has announced plans to build their version of a plug - in electric car and place them into corporate fleets in 2010			1
plus , @entity76 will be introducing an electric car for fleet use in 2010 , but the company has not announced yet whether it will be a plug - in			1
some obstacles still need to be overcome , but with gasoline projected to stay high , automakers may have more incentive than ever to bring a plug - in electric car to market			1
@entity47 autos : most - popular fuel - efficient cars so this seemed like a good time to check in with the major players in the plug - in sweepstakes -- and talk to a research group that is working in conjunction with the automakers -- to get an update on their progress			1
it also offered a chance to discuss the various aspects of the march toward the electric car being not only a reality , but perhaps a ubiquitous presence on @entity63 highways			1
@entity47 autos : best resale value cars how it works the above - named automakers are each using somewhat different variations of plug - in electric - car technology -- that is , they 're using different variations of plug - in battery technology and a gas engine			1
let 's look at the @entity6 first , since that 's the one that will seemingly be the first to hit the marketplace : @entity1 has said that the @entity6 has a leg up , since it draws from @entity2 's previous experience in the modern electric - vehicle market when it launched the @entity123 in 1996			1
volt owners will be able to fully charge its lithium - ion battery by plugging it into a 110 - volt outlet for approximately six hours a day , which for most drivers will presumably be while they are sleeping			0
@entity47 autos : luxury cars with best gas mileage " the average driver drives about 30 miles a day , " says @entity134 , @entity136 's vehicle line director for the volt			0
" and when the @entity6 's battery has been fully charged , and you drive under regular driving conditions , you 'll be able to drive about 40 miles a day using only the electricity from the battery			2
so , in that scenario , you 're using zero gasoline , which is a pretty appealing proposition , given the current price of gas			0
" however , if you 're not an average driver , and you log more than those 40 miles , once the battery is depleted , a 1.0 - liter , three - cylinder turbocharged gasoline engine will spin to create electricity and replenish the battery			0
on schedule " we definitely feel that we 're on schedule , that we will be able to deliver the volt before the end of 2010 , " @entity134 said			0
" we 're working closely with our battery developers , and based on their progress , we 're definitely on track to hit that 2010 date			0
" @entity47 autos : best hybrids eighteen months ago , many in the industry thought that the internally - mandated 2010 date was just too much to expect , given all of the technology and cost implications			2
" well , it is definitely a compressed time frame , " @entity134 conceded			0
" it is unusual to develop a new vehicle and a new propulsion system at the same time			0
but the analogy that mr. @entity1 used was when he compared it to president @entity172 saying that we were going to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade , not ' whenever we feel like it			0
' " ideally , engineers would like the time to make a new product that 's just perfect , but the beauty of this time line is that is makes a statement that @entity2 wants to take a leadership position in this endeavor , with all of those benefits and privileges that would come with that , " @entity134 continued			2
" there is a tremendous opportunity for whoever is the technological leader when it comes to displacing petroleum as the primary source of fuel for automobiles			0
" that 's because a plug - in electric car would only cost about 12 cents per kilowatt hour to operate , said @entity200 , program manager for electric transportation at the @entity202 ( @entity202 ) -- the research and development arm of the electric utility industry			1
" twelve cents per kilowatt hour is roughly the equivalent of less than a dollar per gallon of gasoline , " @entity200 said			0
" obviously , prospects for having a plug - in electric vehicle on the road , in high volumes , are better than they have ever been , " @entity200 said			1
" back in 2001 , we conducted a study and projected 2010 as the year that the plug - in electric car would be able to be commercialized , so the current schedule is indeed meeting our expectations			1
" we 've definitely seen an explosion in the technological advancement of the lithium - ion batteries that have been in development the last few years , " he continued			0
" we 've tested some of these batteries , and we 're optimistic that they 're up to the task , and that they 'll be ready for the marketplace by 2010			0
" the current gas - electric hybrids have been an important step , because they really have allowed for the most efficient use of gasoline to date , because they 've minimized a lot of the waste of fuel that occurred during starting , stopping and idling			1
" but a plug - in vehicle , if you 're the average driver , gives you a chance to completely eliminate the use of gasoline , " @entity200 noted			1
" that would be a tremendous boon to the individual consumer , and would obviously be a boon to the environment , and would benefit the nation geopolitically , given our current dependence on foreign oil			0
" cost and durability as mentioned previously , the hurdles to a mass - market launch thus far have been the cost and the efficiency of the lithium - ion battery			2
@entity253 , @entity71 's @entity254 , thinks that these are significant challenges			2
" there are a number of things we still need to find out about the lithium - ion battery before @entity71 can bring the plug - in car to the consumer market , " @entity253 said			1
" we need to see how it performs , how durable it is , and what its limitations might be			0
" @entity265 , @entity53 's chief engineer for hybrid and fuel - cell technology development , agreed			2
" there has definitely been progress with the technology of the lithium - ion battery , but the industry still needs to get the volumes up and the cost down in order to make it work as a commercially viable proposition , " @entity265 said			0
and @entity2 's @entity134 noted that , " remember , we 're not talking about a nice , clean , air - conditioned environment that these batteries will be operating in			2
" these are environments where there are dramatic temperature swings , and where the batteries will be subjected to dirt , debris , moisture , vibration , and possible crash situations , " @entity134 said			0
" so the challenge was to develop a battery that is not only cost effective , but one that can also meet these rigorous operational requirements , and one that will also last 10 years or 150,000 miles			0
" @entity2 is currently working with a few different battery developers , who are sharing their research , and " we have techs testing them for hours , and there is nothing we have encountered , from a technical standpoint , that was unexpected , or that would deter us from the 2010 date			1
" @entity134 also noted that " one challenge has been getting the weight of the battery pack down , and we now have it down to 375 pounds			0
" as for cost , @entity134 is also aware that " the price of the first batteries are frankly going to be unacceptable , from a long - term perspective , but we 're marching ahead regardless , because we know that once we get these cars into the marketplace , and the sales volume increases , the cost will come down			2
we 're not looking at making a profit on the first volts we introduce to the public -- but that will happen over the longer term , as they become more popular and we ramp up production			0
" @entity202 's @entity200 reframes that proposition , observing that , " any carmaker who comes out with a new , revolutionary technology like this knows that the product will have to cross the valley of death initially , in that they wo n't make any profit from it			0
profit will come later , after they 're on the market for a while and volumes have increased			0
