-- @entity1 has more than 50 nuclear power plants and had planned to build two dozen more by 2030 , according to a professor who has written on @entity1 energy and security policy			1
@entity1 relies heavily on nuclear power because of a lack of resources for other energy forms			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity10 , the director of @entity12 's @entity11 , about @entity1 's nuclear power history			1
below is a transcript of that conversation : question : why did @entity1 so readily turn to nuclear power when the country experienced the terrible effects of nuclear radiation when it was bombed during @entity22 ? @entity10 : it 's a good question , but it 's a fairly easy one to answer			1
despite that history , @entity1 is resource poor			1
and its resource poverty trumped its unpleasant history with nuclear radiation			2
that is , @entity1 knew that it would need more resources if it were going to transform itself into a global powerhouse			1
and it had no oil			0
it was running out of coal and there was no liquefied natural gas in the 1950s			0
the economy was getting uncorked and ramped up at unprecedented speed			0
so nuclear power was very attractive for that reason			1
secondly , it was an entirely new frontier technologically in a country that has always been an avid consumer of advanced technology			0
third , it presented an enormous business opportunity , particularly for the power reactor vendors : @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53			2
it was also great for the construction industry			0
so large - scale business in @entity1 was earliest out of the gate in support of @entity1 's acquisition of nuclear technology and for signing up for the @entity61 in the 1950s			1
question : are the power plants related to the @entity65 reconstruction efforts there after @entity22 ? @entity10 : no , it comes a little bit after that			1
by 1954 , when the @entity61 program was getting uncorked , the @entity1 economy had been reconstructed			1
thanks in part to the @entity72 and the demand for heavy equipment for the @entity65 military , a lot of @entity1 industry had come back on line -- steel , shipbuilding			1
this led to high - speed growth , which really took off by the 1960s at exactly the same moment @entity1 nuclear power came online			1
question : what sort of considerations were taken into consideration in those early years about building nuclear plants in a heavy earthquake zone ? @entity10 : from the very beginning , it was acknowledged there was a risk and so engineers were cognizant of the dangers at the time			1
but the thirst for energy and a general optimism about technology trumped their concerns			2
... question : how many nuclear power plants are there in @entity1 ? @entity10 : there are 54			1
... that 's no. 2 in the world after @entity110 in terms of the percentage of electric power supply			0
and the latest basic energy law in @entity1 has a " nuclear first " caste to it			1
under those guidelines , more than two dozen more would be built by 2030			1
i can not imagine that these plans will be operative at this point			0
question : what else should people know about the country 's nuclear plants ? @entity10 : the cause of greatest concern is probably the @entity129			2
the @entity130 was adopted based on a @entity1 desire to " close the fuel cycle			2
" @entity1 is , after all , driven by an ideology of a resource poverty			2
so the prospect of self - reliance in energy -- in the form of the @entity129 -- became the @entity139			0
this was embraced as national policy despite its use of plutonium fuel and despite the risks of diversion			0
there is also concern that @entity1 's neighbors might view its @entity130 as a shortcut to nuclear weapons program			1
the @entity110 and the @entity65 both abandoned it			0
and there have been accidents with them			0
question : there have been several accidents over the last two decades involving @entity1 nuclear plants , including allegations of cover - ups			1
@entity10 : let 's just say the @entity1 regulatory system did n't acquit itself well in those earlier cases			2
... you do notice a marked difference between this crisis and the way that they responded to the last earthquake -- that they learned from the 1995 earthquake in @entity174 about how to respond , how to accept help from abroad			2
and one can only hope that they moved to enhance the nuclear regulatory system in @entity1			1
in @entity174 , they failed to mobilize their military in a timely way			0
they refused to accept foreign assistance			0
they invoked silly regulations about the type of medicines that could be distributed			0
they simply bungled the search - and - rescue efforts			0
many people attribute some portion of the more than 6,000 deaths from that disaster to the ineptitude of the @entity1 government			2
importantly , no one is making those accusations this time			0
the government was very quick to mobilize troops			0
indeed , this is the largest mobilization of @entity1 forces since @entity22 there are 100,000 troops deployed right now			2
this is huge and important			0
how many lives they can save in a catastrophe of this magnitude , we do n't know			0
but it is certainly a different response than the one we saw 16 years ago .			0

@entity1 turned to nuclear power because of a lack of resources for other energy forms
