@entity0 -- a dark chapter in recent @entity0 history stands to close with a proposal for the city to pay a $ 40 million civil rights settlement to five black and @entity8 men wrongfully convicted in the horrific beating and rape of a white female jogger in @entity12 in 1989 , a source with knowledge of the settlement told @entity1 on friday			1
the sensational case polarized the city along racial lines and became emblematic of a state of rampant crime			1
five minority teenagers , who became known as the @entity21 , were coerced amid public uproar into making incriminating statements and convicted in 1990			1
the proposed agreement between the city law department and the five men -- who served between seven and 13 years in prison -- averages about $ 1 million per year of incarceration , according to the source			1
one of the men , @entity33 , served 13 years in prison			1
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 each served about seven years			2
the proposed settlement still has to be approved by the city comptroller and then submitted for approval to judge @entity42 of the @entity43 in @entity44 , where the men filed their civil rights lawsuit			1
the source said a formal announcement on the settlement would be made next week			1
the agreement was first reported in the @entity51			2
in a statement friday , the city comptroller 's office said it had received the agreement			1
" as with all proposed settlements , under our charter - mandated authority , we will do our due diligence and provide feedback to ensure that any settlement we approve is in the best interests of the @entity62 , " the statement said			2
in 2012 , filmmaker @entity65 , along with daughter @entity63 and her husband , @entity64 , produced an award - winning documentary about the infamous case			1
" we are thrilled to hear about the potential settlement with the @entity21 , " the three said in statement friday			0
" it will finally give some closure and bring a measure of justice in this tragic case			1
the five men were just teenagers when they were wrongly convicted			1
... their story has come to symbolize the immense challenges we continue to confront when it comes to race in this country , but it is also the story of five men maintaining their dignity in the face of injustice and now , of the collective power to acknowledge and correct our mistakes			2
" @entity63 told @entity1 that it was time for the story of the @entity21 " to be over			0
" " having gotten to know them well ... the closure and finishing this meant a lot , " she said			0
" i never heard them talk about money , but i heard them talk about closure and being able to move on , and feeling some sense that a settlement would be an acknowledgment to their exoneration , and that meant a lot to them even though it 's not like they 're ever gon na get an apology for the people responsible			0
but this is the closest they 'll get , and that does mean a lot			0
" on april 19 , 1989 , a 28 - year - old @entity119 investment banker jogging through @entity12 was raped , viciously beaten and left for dead			0
she would have no memory of the attack			0
that same night , a group of black and @entity124 boys had been in the park , throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people in a practice the media and law enforcement at the time called " wilding			0
" an investigation led to the arrest of five teens who were accused of rampaging through the park in a " wolf pack " and preying on innocent victims			0
they were charged and convicted			2
" if they had their way , " @entity141 told @entity1 in 2012 , " we would have been hanging from one of those lovely trees here in @entity12			0
" the victim , @entity37 , kept her identity hidden for 14 years until the publication of her book , " i am the @entity37			0
" " i guess there are lots of theories out there but i just do n't know and it 's almost too confusing for me to understand , " she told @entity1 in 2003 , referring to the false confessions given by the five men			2
" i 've had to come to peace with it by saying : ' you know what ? i 'm just not going to know			0
' " three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms , one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when @entity37 , a serial rapist and murderer in 2001 confessed to the crime and said he had acted alone			1
" after being exonerated , it 's like somebody running free through the ... grass and throwing their hands up and yelling , ' ah ! ' you know ... the feeling is overjoy and happiness , " @entity141 told @entity1			0
dna analysis later determined that @entity181 did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys ' trials did not match			1
@entity186 , the @entity44 district attorney at the time , ordered a new investigation and , on his recommendation , a judge vacated the convictions			0
a civil rights lawsuit filed by the five men accused police and prosecutors of false arrest , malicious prosecution and a racially motivated conspiracy			2
the administration of former mayor @entity198 fought the case , but his successor , @entity200 , pledged to settle the suit before taking office .			1
