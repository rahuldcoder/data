@entity0 -- he may not be zipping into a flight suit on the deck of an aircraft carrier , but president @entity6 is embracing the set pieces of a commander at war weeks into his campaign against @entity12 terrorists in @entity13 and @entity14			1
his advisers have similarly been keen to demonstrate his grasp of the global @entity18 crisis , orchestrating two photo - ops in 24 hours — on a sunday and a federal holiday — that showed @entity6 consulting with health officials about the outbreak			1
neither instance featured any remarks from the president himself , or the chance to ask him questions			0
but as questions mount about the government 's response to a range of challenges , the pictures underscore the importance the @entity36 now places on appearing to have a grasp on the crises it 's confronting			0
on tuesday , @entity6 confers with top commanders and allied defense chiefs outside @entity0 at @entity42 — a @entity44 and @entity45 installation that 's more familiar to @entity6 as the seconds - long layover before jetting off on @entity47 or the site of weekend golf			2
last week he made a rare trip across the @entity51 to convene meetings with his top military brass at the @entity54 , a session he admitted would take place at the @entity36 in calmer times			0
" now was a good time for me to come over to the @entity54 and have an opportunity to hear from our top military about the work that they 're doing , " he said on wednesday			0
and last month @entity6 flew to @entity63 for an in - person update on the war he 's waging against @entity66 at @entity67 , which has been executing his plan to " degrade and ultimately destroy " the terror group			2
the wartime photo - op is a tool familiar to presidents going back decades : think of the " mission accomplished " banner hanging behind former president @entity75 on the @entity76 as he declared an end to major combat operations in @entity14 , 8½ years and thousands of casualties before the war ended			1
that moment — which @entity75 later said he regretted and which all future presidents will likely use as a model to avoid — is a far cry from the moments the @entity36 is crafting for @entity6 , which have come as the president receives updates and advice from top commanders			2
so , too , have the president 's aides been careful to demonstrate their grasp on the unfolding @entity18 crisis , orchestrating a sunday photograph — shot through the @entity98 window — of @entity6 discussing the latest @entity18 case in @entity100 with his @entity102 secretary			0
on monday , with most of the @entity36 darkened for the @entity105 holiday , photographers were permitted to capture @entity6 meeting with top health officials to further hash out what went wrong in @entity100 , where a nurse who was caring for an @entity111 patient with @entity18 contracted the virus herself			1
for a president who has claimed to be uninterested in " photo - ops , " the rash of appearances seem to repudiate oft - cited criticism that @entity6 remains too detached — a line @entity119 repeated on sunday			1
" i would say that we do n't know exactly who 's in charge , " sen. @entity120 said of the @entity18 outbreak on @entity1 's " @entity122			0
