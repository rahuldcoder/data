@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity6 administration made a " fatal mistake " by talking up facts and figures without painting a broader picture of the obstacles in its widely criticized @entity12 response effort , @entity4 chief @entity3 said thursday			1
@entity3 told @entity2 's @entity14 that the talking points he and other federal officials used at the time did n't tell the whole story			1
" they were factually correct , but were n't in context			0
we 're moving all of this stuff in			0
rescue teams are doing this , " he said			0
" but we never explained to the people that it 's not coming as fast as we want it to , and it 's not enough , because of the number of people that were left behind in the aftermath of the storm			1
" not making that clear was a " fatal mistake , " @entity3 said			1
" had i said that at the time , i probably would have gotten the old hook and been pulled off the stage anyway , but the truth would have been out , " he said			0
speaking five years after the storm hit , @entity3 sharply criticized former secretary of homeland security @entity42 's handling of the situation			1
@entity42 had attended an avian flu convention amid the disaster			0
" here is why that 's so important			2
in the middle of any crisis , " @entity3 said , " whether it 's a natural disaster or man - made disaster , you need to have one person in charge			1
and that person needs to be on the ground with the team , understanding what 's going on			0
" the former @entity4 head told @entity2 that he winced when president @entity6 said the now infamous line , " @entity3 , you 're doing a heck of a job			1
" " i knew the minute he said that , the media and everybody else would see a disconnect between what he was saying and what i was witnessing on the ground , " @entity3 said			2
" that 's the president 's style			0
his attitude and demeanor is always one of being a cheerleader and trying to encourage people to keep moving			0
it was just the wrong time and the wrong place			0
" @entity3 headed @entity4 under the @entity6 administration and resigned in september 2005 , two weeks after @entity12 struck the @entity81 and 10 days after president @entity6 famously complimented him			1
@entity42 was criticized by a @entity83 in 2006 for choosing @entity3 to lead the government response , despite inadequate training			2
" if i knew then what i know now about mr. @entity3 's agenda , i would have done something different , " @entity42 said			1
