-- as fast as @entity2 fell from @entity4 's good graces at the start of 2011 , he made his comeback even faster			1
thanks in large part to his public apology at the 63rd @entity10 , @entity2 will welcome the new year with a clean slate -- and a new tv show slated to premiere next summer			1
but it was n't tiger blood that allowed the self - proclaimed warlock to turn his life around so quickly			2
it was the magic of celebrity			2
the entertainment industry is always quick to forgive celebrities , said @entity23 , owner of @entity25 public relations firm in @entity26			1
once celebrities own up to their wrongdoings and apologize , @entity27 said , it 's easy for them to get back on track -- often with help from a skilled team of handlers and image consultants			1
fellow comeback kid @entity36 can attest			1
after separating from @entity37 in october 2010 , and sharing @entity38 on @entity41 's @entity40 radio show , @entity36 checked himself into a live - in rehab facility at the beginning of the year			1
in april , the same month " @entity44 " hit theaters , the actor appeared on " @entity47 " to celebrate 100 days of sobriety			2
and with a spot on the 13th season of " @entity51 , " @entity36 was back in business			1
one reason it 's so easy for celebrities to bounce back from scandal or personal issues is because when they hit rock bottom , they 're doing it with money and connections to boot , @entity4 image consultant @entity53 said			1
and as nice as disposable income can be during a crisis , their connections should n't be discounted			2
@entity36 would n't have rebounded so quickly if he had n't been in the public eye each week on " @entity51 , " @entity27 said			1
with @entity37 and their daughter , @entity37 , in the audience supporting him , viewers saw a wonderful family image			2
" even i fell in love with him through that show , " she added			2
but without a willing client , @entity27 said , such connections are irrelevant			0
@entity75 , @entity2 's ex-publicist , might agree			1
@entity75 resigned in february after representing @entity2 for about seven years -- through the actor 's dismissal from " @entity78			1
" @entity2 obviously was n't cooperative for a while , @entity27 said , referring to the actor 's media outbursts , including a " no - holds - barred " live interview with @entity83 in which @entity2 ripped into his " @entity78 " bosses and talked about one day sharing his " epic " drug stories with his children			1
but once celebrities apologize and man up to what they 've done , @entity27 said , the industry is usually quick to forgive			1
and when that happens , the fans will follow suit			2
@entity94 has certainly benefited from this cycle as well			0
the singer , who pleaded guilty to assaulting then - girlfriend @entity97 in 2009 , surprised viewers with a high - energy performance at the @entity100 in august			0
@entity27 said it 's much easier for a self - destructive celebrity to rebound than it is for someone such as @entity94 , but " the music industry has forgiven him now			2
so ( his fans ) are starting to			0
" of course , this year has n't been all steps in the right direction for @entity94			0
he raised his voice and stormed off the " @entity112 " set in march after being asked about the @entity97 assault			0
by being respectful , apologizing and focusing on his work , @entity94 has slowly started to rise above his problems , publicists agree			0
@entity94 did what celebrities should do when plagued by scandal -- focus on the work , said @entity121 , director at @entity122			2
@entity94 's album " graffiti , " released in 2009 , received mostly negative reviews from critics			0
" @entity127 , " however , was met with praise -- debuting at no. 1 on the @entity130 chart in march			0
@entity131 was also due for a turnabout this year -- having been on the mend since her public meltdown in 2007			1
the pop princess released " @entity136 , " her sixth chart - topping album , in march			0
she received the @entity138 at the @entity139 in august			0
and she confirmed her engagement to her former manager , @entity141 , on december 16			0
the media was quick to acknowledge @entity131 ' comeback			1
in a post about her march appearance on " @entity148 , " the @entity144 said , " whoever 's managing @entity131 these days is doing a pretty great job			1
" @entity27 said , " i love @entity131			1
she did n't do anything wrong			0
people were very mean to her and they should n't have been			0
... i do n't worry about her anymore			0
she got it together , and she has a strong team behind her			0
" at that level of celebrity , @entity27 added , a star 's team is everything			0
" they can block a lot of stress for you			0
tell you why you should n't pay attention to this or that			0
... the average person does n't have that kind of support			0
" now at 30 , @entity131 finally seems to have her life back on track , which @entity173 said makes her a good example for one of 2011 's most notorious celebrities : @entity177			1
but things may be looking up for the tabloid - prone @entity177			1
already on probation for two 2007 drunken - driving convictions , @entity177 is required to complete community service after being sentenced in may in the theft of a necklace			1
on december 14 , a @entity186 judge praised the 25 - year - old for complying with her probation requirements			0
moreover , @entity177 's @entity192 pictorial " is breaking sales records , " @entity189 tweeted on december 18			1
" ( @entity177 is ) not a diplomat , " @entity173 said			1
" she 's a blond bombshell movie star , so a @entity192 cover makes sense			0
... but she needs to do another film			0
and for her sake , it better be a good one ... not some bubblegum crap			0
" like @entity131 , @entity173 said @entity177 has time on her side			1
the industry is less likely to forgive older celebrities , @entity27 agreed , adding that celebrities should be able to pull it together by their late 20s			1
and then there 's @entity2 , she joked			1
" instead of doing a one - man rant directed by nobody , " @entity173 said , " ( @entity2 ) should assemble a team of brilliant comedy writers ... pay them their weight in gold and produce a film			1
" but his @entity215 comedy , " @entity217 , " to air in the summer , may be close enough for now			0
and while some people call @entity2 's " @entity223 " tour and public outbursts a fiasco , others are dubbing it a genius marketing ploy			2
" ( @entity2 has ) had his problems , " image consultant @entity53 said			1
" but i think he got it right this whole year			0
he created a great persona and a great character , and i think this was a great act on his part			0
" regardless of how people choose to read into @entity2 's tumultuous year , it would appear he 's on his way back to the top			2
" we 're all rooting for @entity2 , " @entity173 said			2
" every time we turn on ' @entity78 ' i think we miss him			0
because , as charming as @entity238 is , he 's not @entity2			2

after an apology at the @entity10 , @entity2 welcomes 2012 with a clean slate
the entertainment industry is always quick to forgive celebrities , publicist says
@entity36 rebounded with help from rehab and " @entity51 " appearance
@entity177 should follow example of @entity131 , image consultant says
