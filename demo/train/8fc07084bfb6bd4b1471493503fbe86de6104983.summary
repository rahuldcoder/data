@entity0 -- less than 48 hours before primaries in @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity5 received a key endorsement from @entity3 's governor sunday while his current main challenger , @entity8 , appeared to downplay his own chances of winning in the @entity3			1
the two are leading the pack in the @entity13 presidential campaign that includes former house speaker @entity14 and @entity16 rep. @entity15 as it heads into a series of crucial contests in coming weeks , including @entity19 on march 6 when 437 delegates from 10 states will be at stake			1
@entity4 is emerging as a showdown between @entity5 and @entity8 , with the outcome expected to significantly impact the campaign			1
if @entity5 comes from behind in the polls to win the state considered home turf where his father was governor , he will cement his status as the lone front - runner and presumptive nominee			2
a @entity8 victory would raise further questions about @entity5 's ability to attract broad conservative support in the primaries or against president @entity39 in november 's general election			1
the latest polls from @entity4 and @entity3 put @entity5 and @entity8 in a virtual tie in both states , but the trends show @entity5 increasing his support as tuesday 's primary approaches			1
@entity3 gov. @entity47 , a tea party conservative known for legal and public clashes with @entity39 over immigration policy , announced her endorsement of @entity5 on @entity54 's " @entity55 " program sunday			1
" i think he has that pro-business background and he has that political history that i think he would serve @entity61 the best of all the candidates , " @entity56 said , adding that @entity5 also has the best chance of defeating @entity39 in november			1
@entity8 cited negative ads by the @entity5 campaign and super pac supporters for the tightening poll numbers , and he sounded resigned to a second - place finish in @entity3			1
" that 's another tough state for us , " @entity8 told the @entity54 program			2
" demographically , it does n't work quite as well for us as maybe some other states			0
" regardless , he said , the results of tuesday 's primaries would show the @entity13 nomination was down to a two - person race pitting him against @entity5			1
@entity8 and @entity79 are vying to be the main conservative challenger against the more moderate @entity5			1
@entity79 is banking on a strong @entity19 performance in the @entity82 , which represented in @entity83 , and neighboring @entity84 to revitalize his flagging campaign			0
in his push for conservative support , @entity79 warned sunday in remarks at a @entity90 church that liberal elitism was threatening the country			1
" you have elites in the bureaucracy , elites in the judgeship , frankly elites in the news media , elites in the academic world , and elites in politics -- and they would all like to impose on us an @entity61 that none of us believe in , " @entity79 said			2
@entity15 , the libertarian champion who has a devoted but limited support base among mostly young followers , has waged a strategic campaign aimed at accumulating delegates so he can assert influence at the @entity13 convention in august			2
so far , @entity5 's advantage in money and organization have helped him fend off challenges from a succession of @entity13 contenders			1
on sunday , @entity5 surrogates appeared on talk shows to boost his chances ahead of the upcoming contests			2
@entity121 gov. @entity120 , a strong @entity5 backer , declared on the @entity123 program " @entity124 " that " @entity8 's not going to be the nominee , " while @entity3 sen. @entity126 told @entity1 's " @entity130 " that he was " confident @entity5 will do well on tuesday night in @entity3 and in @entity4 and hopefully that will move this process forward so we can concentrate on the real adversary			1
" another veteran @entity131 @entity13 , @entity132 of @entity133 , also told the @entity1 program that he expects @entity5 to win both states on tuesday			1
while @entity132 has yet to endorse a candidate , he praised @entity5 for " getting better and better " throughout the campaign season			2
" @entity5 really has sharpened his skills , and i think that will pay dividends if he gets the nomination , " @entity132 said			0
meanwhile , the senior adviser to @entity39 's re-election campaign did his best sunday to encourage a drawn - out @entity13 nomination process			2
former @entity146 press secretary @entity145 , now advising @entity39 's campaign , told @entity1 that @entity8 has a " legitimate chance " to become the @entity13 nominee and described the former @entity149 senator as a candidate with blue - collar appeal who is " clearly somebody who has a very different economic background than @entity5			1
" predicting tuesday 's contests in @entity4 and @entity3 will not be a " clarifying event , " @entity145 said he expects the primary to go on for " weeks and weeks			1
" a tea party group also sought to boost @entity8 's candidacy sunday , urging @entity4 conservatives to donate money and back @entity8 even if they support @entity79 in order to damage @entity5 's chances			1
" no matter who your preferred candidate might be down the road , if you want to stop @entity5 , @entity8 needs to stop @entity5 in @entity4 , " said an appeal from the @entity167			1
" we 're trying to make sure that happens			0
" @entity5 did a rare talk show appearance on " @entity176 " in which he defended his stance against the auto industry bailout in 2008 and also parried questions about what critics call his inability as a wealthy businessman to connect with working - class @entity61 such as tea party conservatives			1
last week , @entity5 's comment that his family owns several cars kept at different residences , including two cadillacs driven by his wife , came under media scrutiny			2
" you know , i ca n't be perfect			0
i just am who i am , " @entity5 said on the @entity176 program , later adding : " if people think that there is something wrong with being successful in @entity61 , then they better vote for the other guy , because i 've been extraordinarily successful and i want to use that success and that know - how to help the @entity61 people			1
" @entity5 also pushed back against critics of his opposition to the government bailout of the auto industry when the recession hit in 2008			0
democrats and their labor union supporters have highlighted the @entity5 stance in @entity4 , saying he would have turned his back on workers in a time of need			1
to @entity5 , the issue is about government fiscal intervention in a market - driven industry			0
" you 've seen all sorts of businesses go in bankruptcy			0
and they come out and are stronger , " @entity5 said on @entity176			0
" this is not the first time that an industry or a company has been in trouble			0
" he said he opposed " writing checks " when auto industry leaders asked for help , instead of forcing them into what he called a managed bankruptcy and then helping them recover			0
" after bankruptcy , that was the time to give them the financial support , the guarantees to provide the help to get them out of bankruptcy , " @entity5 added			0
" that 's the way it would have been done best			0
" however , @entity5 did n't directly respond when asked if his plan would have forced the automakers into a more severe form of bankruptcy that would have resulted in greater job losses and a more difficult recovery			0
@entity8 went after @entity5 on the auto bailout issue , saying the former @entity249 governor was ideologically inconsistent because he had supported the government bailout of @entity252 firms but opposed the help for the auto industry			1
" @entity5 supported his friends on @entity252 and then turned his back on the people of @entity260 , " @entity8 told the @entity256 program " this week with @entity261			2
" " now i say turned his back because he supports the concept of bailouts			0
and that 's the difference between the two approaches			0
" @entity8 also continued to wrestle with the increased attention to his campaign since he surged to the top of polls in recent weeks following his sweep of contests in @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 earlier this month			0
in his appearances on @entity256 and @entity54 , he was questioned about comments last week that challenged @entity39 's push for students to attend college and the call more than 50 years ago by former president @entity283 -- the nation 's first @entity285 president -- for an absolute separation of church and state			0
on @entity256 , @entity8 said the @entity283 speech -- which sought to ease concerns about his faith interfering with his ability to govern -- made him sick			0
" what kind of country do we live that says only people of non-faith can come into the public square and make their case ? " @entity8 said in seeking to link his interpretation of the @entity283 speech with his criticism of the @entity39 administration for what he calls impeding on religious freedom			0
" that makes me throw up and it should make every @entity61 who has seen from the president , someone who is now trying to tell people of faith that you will do what the government says , we are going to impose our values on you , " @entity8 said , later adding that imposition of government values was " the next logical step when people of faith , at least according to @entity283 , have no role in the public square			2
" on higher education , @entity8 was asked about declaring calling @entity39 a snob for advocating that all @entity61 students go to college if possible			2
after first responding on @entity256 that not everyone wants or needs a college education to succeed , noting that a trade school or a music career were examples of alternative options , @entity8 characterized the majority of @entity61 colleges and universities as liberal - biased institutions that are biased against conservative thinkers and religious believers			1
" we have some real problems at our college campuses with political correctness , with an ideology that is forced upon people who , you know , who may not agree with the politically correct left doctrine , " @entity8 said			0
" and one of the things that i 've spoken out on and will continue to speak out is to make sure that conservative and more mainstream , commonsense conservative and principles that have made this country great are reflected in our college courses and with college professors			0
and at many , many , and i would argue most institutions in this country , that simply is n't the case			0
" some republicans have warned that such strident conservative rhetoric would hurt the party 's cause in the general election against @entity39 , when the @entity13 nominee will need the support of independents to win			2
@entity120 took that stance sunday , telling the @entity123 program that he believed declaring @entity39 a snob over the higher education issue was " probably over the line			0
" he also criticized @entity8 for what he called " naked opportunism " in questioning @entity5 's conservative credentials , noting @entity8 endorsed @entity5 in 2008			1
