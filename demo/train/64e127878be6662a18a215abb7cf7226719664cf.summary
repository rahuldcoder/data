what if i had n't worked so hard ? what if			2
my position to be a role model for balance ? had i done so intentionally , who 's to say that , besides having more time with my family , i would n't also have been even more focused at work ? more creative ? more productive ? it took inoperable late stage brain cancer to get me to examine things from this angle			1
-- @entity16 , former ceo , @entity17 while working on " @entity19 , " @entity18 regularly took off from painting for several hours at a time and seemed to be daydreaming aimlessly			0
urged by his patron , the prior of @entity23 , to work more continuously , @entity18 is reported to have replied , immodestly but accurately , " the greatest geniuses sometimes accomplish more when they work less			2
" -- @entity26 , " be excellent at anything " in his 1932 classic essay , " in praise of @entity35 , " @entity27 heralded a coming time when modern technology would bring shorter work hours and time for leisure to be enjoyed equally by everyone			1
work and leisure both would be " delightful , " and the world would be the better for it			1
" every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it , and every painter will be able to paint without starving			0
above all , there will be happiness and joy of life , instead of frayed nerves , weariness and dyspepsia			0
" @entity27 , along with scholars like @entity51 , author of " leisure , the @entity57 , " thought that it is in moments of leisure that civilization gets created			2
both were extraordinarily productive , despite their call for what may today be seen as slacking			0
but they argued that it is only when we take the time to lift our noses from the grindstone and are not busy with the getting , making and doing that ensures our survival , that flights of imagination , bursts of insight can lead to inventions like the wheel , art , philosophy , literature , scientific discoveries and innovation			0
at the turn of the 20th century , leisure time was the ultimate status symbol , a way not only of conspicuously showing off your wealth , but of your ability to enjoy the best that life had to offer			2
even those without wealth in the labor movement sought a living wage and shorter work hours so they could , as a famous protest song of the time put it , not only have their bread , but the time to enjoy the roses , the fruits of their labor			2
ironically , it was only when @entity101 took the wildly controversial step of shuttering his automobile manufacturing factories on saturday and cutting daily work hours from the then - standard 12 to 8 that workers began not only enjoying leisure time at home , but became more efficient and productive at work			1
though his fellow captains of industry screamed in protest , @entity108 had based the decision on his own in - house research of how far he could push manual laborers before they became so exhausted or resentful that they 'd begin making costly mistakes			2
within a few years , the @entity108 way became the industry standard , and thus was born the 40 - hour work week			1
economists , too , began making rosy predictions of a coming age of abundant leisure			2
@entity124 thought that by 2030 , we 'd be working a 15 - hour work week , and all would have time to enjoy " the hour and the day virtuously and well			1
" others predicted a 22 - hour work week , six - month work year or a standard retirement age of 38			1
if anything , thinkers at the time worried about what the masses would do to occupy themselves with so much free time on their hands			0
the predictions seem ludicrous now			0
in the @entity141 , white - collar workers work longer and more extreme hours than their peers in just about any other advanced economy , save @entity144 , where the @entity145 has reported overworked @entity146 are checking themselves into prison - like meditation retreats just to get away from it all , and @entity149 , where they 've even coined a word for death from overwork : karoshi			1
( no one leaves until the boss leaves			0
and the boss never leaves			0
) workers in the @entity141 give up among the most vacation days			1
we are the only advanced economy with no national vacation policy ( see how we stack up in the chart below )			2
and technology has enabled not just flexible work , but for work to seep into every corner , every hour and every minute of the day			2
the 40 - hour work week of @entity108 's legacy can seem like a cruel dream -- the labor policy that later enshrined it , the 1938 @entity165 , now perversely gives businesses incentive to work salaried workers to the point of burnout , and to keep hourly workers ' hours artificially low to avoid paying benefits or overtime			1
salaried workers have too little leisure time that they can choose and control , what leisure scholars say is the essence of pure leisure			1
and hourly workers , too much			0
though without either choice or control , those blank , unfilled hours of insecurity and gnawing anxiety can hardly be called leisure			0
just as with income inequality , our experience of work and leisure is increasingly diverging			1
as millions of @entity141 remained sidelined from the economy , working far less than they 'd like , and for a minimum wage that in no major city in the country could cover the cost of a two - bedroom apartment , others wear long work hours like a badge of honor			1
economists have found that our workplaces reward employees by how long they sit at their desks in the office , not for what they do			1
leisure is seen as unproductive at best , and frivolous or a waste of time at worst			0
and that 's not just stupid , it 's dangerous			0
we need to build an economy that creates enough work at fair wages for everyone			0
and we need to recapture our lost leisure			1
those two aspirations can work together			0
in a knowledge economy , our strength comes from the power of our ideas			0
and we are wired for those ideas and inspiration to hit in quiet moments of -- leisure			0
psychologists @entity232 and @entity234 have mapped brain waves and found the " a-ha " moment comes in a calm , relaxed state , when we are doing anything but work -- like when physicist @entity242 idly watched students goofing off spinning plates in the cafeteria and began making calculations of the wobbles , " for the fun of it , " which led to his developing the " @entity252 " to explain quantum electrodynamics and ultimately resulted in his @entity251			0
neuroscience is finding that when we are idle , in leisure , our brains are most active , the @entity254 lights up , which , like airport hubs , connect parts of our brain that do n't typically communicate			1
so a stray thought , a random memory , an image can combine in novel ways to produce novel ideas			0
@entity266 studied elite musicians at the @entity269 @entity268 and is credited with the now wildly popular notion that it takes 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to master anything			0
but the key that separated the truly great from the good and the adequate was the way they spent those 10,000 hours : they practiced intensely , first thing in the morning when they were freshest , for no more than 60 to 90 minutes at a time , and they rested more			0
in other words , like brain waves , like heart beats , they worked in short bursts and recovered in leisure and became excellent at what they did			0
but perhaps the most compelling case for leisure is this : despite our overwork culture , we have a lot of butt - in - chair presenteeism , sick , unhappy , burned out and disengaged workers			1
we work long hours , but we do not necessarily work productive , efficient or creative hours			1
some years , international comparisons of gdp per hours worked have found , workers in @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and even @entity301 , with their 30 days of paid vacation every year , their caf√© culture , their generous paid family leave policies , their short work hours mandated by law and their new directive forbidding some employers from expecting workers to check work - related texts and emails after hours , beat us by a mile			1
as we think about the next @entity141 economy , we need to consider policies , as well as cultural shifts , that respect that people need time , especially relaxed and personal time , every bit as much as they need money			1
by dialing down on overwork , by once again matching wages , which have been stagnating , to productivity , which has been rising , we might not only be able to create more work for those who need it , and work smarter , but foster the creativity and innovation that will lead to a more dynamic , productive economy , and a better life			2
after all , is n't the pursuit of happiness part of what defines us as @entity141 ?			1

in the @entity141 , white - collar workers work longer than peers in most advanced countries
@entity340 : we need to recapture our lost leisure ; more work does n't raise productivity
she says *companies* reward workers for how long they sit at their desks , not for what they do
