-- imagine that you have made it to the @entity3 from a country where economic opportunities are absent			1
you 've found work in a laundry , a restaurant kitchen , a nursing home , or on a construction site			2
the pay is low by @entity3 standards , but you save enough to send some every month to your family back home			1
every day you put up with hazards and harassment , knowing that if you raise your voice in protest you risk , not only getting fired , but getting reported and deported			0
some weeks you do n't get paid at all , but you keep your mouth shut and live with the abuse			0
hundreds of thousands of immigrant families across the country live this each day			0
now , as @entity26 considers sweeping changes to a broken immigration system , we must press the case for a more humane approach to immigration -- and protections for all workers , immigrant and native - born alike			1
@entity35 , or @entity36 , started in 1887 as a day for workers to press their demands for an eight - hour work day			1
it commemorated a violent suppression of a @entity43 labor rally the year before			2
immigrants , their advocates and allies took the holiday observed on the first of may to another level in 2006 , when they connected workers ' rights to the need for repairs to a broken immigration system			2
on this may 1 , the @entity54 will join them in cities from @entity56 , @entity57 , to @entity58 , @entity59			0
it 's not only workers without the right papers who suffer ; when employers can get away with exploitation , the whole workforce suffers and deplorable conditions ripple through the entire labor market			1
immigration reform legislation offers the prospect of ending such exploitation , by providing a path to citizenship for qualifying individuals and a provisional legal status along the way			1
this would enable workers to stand up for their rights without fear of deportation simply for being an unauthorized worker			2
that could be one of the outcomes of passing the " @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity86 , " the official name of the massive immigration bill now pending in the @entity91			0
for future immigrants , the creation of a new visa category , the @entity95 visa , would provide opportunities for low - skilled workers to move from one employer to another without losing the authorization to work			2
this category would ensure that pay levels are set between minimum wage and medium wage for the particular job , and also would require that labor recruiters be registered and regulated			0
additionally , holders of " @entity95 " visas would be able to seek @entity110 for themselves and their immediate family members			0
the bill also would create a " blue card , " an improvement for agricultural workers			0
those who qualify for these visas would be offered a faster track to permanent residency status			0
the bill is not without problems , such as the provision that mandates that all employers , public and private , use the federal e-verify system , which checks workers ' immigration status			1
this ties access to jobs to a massive data - management system with a long history of errors and abuses			0
making participation in this flawed system obligatory as a condition for a immigration bill is misguided and wrong			0
about 8 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the @entity3 are workers			1
they want what workers everywhere want : safe working conditions , fair wages , and protection from abuse			1
the @entity54 sees that as a reasonable desire , consistent with a belief that all work should confer dignity on workers , employers , and consumers			1
as we say in our policy paper , " @entity154 , " all workers are entitled to humane polices that protect their labor and employment rights			1
this year we must take the opportunity to set a long - sought pathway to protection for workers ' and immigrants ' rights -- so that may day 2014 can be a day to celebrate the progress we have made together			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers : on @entity36 , we celebrate workers and press for fair , humane conditions
they say immigration reform must *include* labor protections for all working in @entity3
writers : employers exploit workers without papers , which affects whole labor market
they say provisions like @entity185 give a path to citizenship and ability to work legally
