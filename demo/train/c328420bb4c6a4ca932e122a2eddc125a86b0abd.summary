the @entity0 of the @entity1 are likely to see a continuation of a severe drought this winter , while the @entity4 will be colder and wetter than average , according to data released thursday by the @entity7			1
@entity8 is expected to influence weather patterns across the country for the second year in a row			1
weather officials say with @entity8 in place , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and other surrounding states are unlikely to get enough rain to alleviate the ongoing drought			1
" ninety - one percent of @entity12 , 87 percent of @entity13 and 63 percent of @entity14 are experiencing extreme or exceptional drought , " said @entity20 , director of the @entity21 based in @entity22 , @entity12			2
parts of @entity12 and @entity13 are more than 30 inches below average in rainfall this year , with little in the forecast to predict the trend is going to change as the winter months approach			2
agricultural losses in @entity12 have reached $ 5 billion in the past year , @entity20 said			0
wildfires in 2011 have destroyed at least 3.5 million acres in the state			0
he also pointed out there are more than 600 separate water systems facing mandatory restrictions			0
parts of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 are also experiencing drought conditions			1
@entity7 expects @entity8 , which returned in august , to gradually strengthen and continue from december through february 2012			1
@entity8 is associated with cooler than normal water temperatures in the tropical @entity44 , which influences weather throughout the world			1
it 's the opposite of @entity48 in which warmer ocean temperatures are seen in the same region			0
" the evolving @entity8 will shape this winter			2
@entity8 is not going anywhere , " said @entity52 , deputy director of @entity7 's @entity53			2
" there is a wild card , though			0
the erratic @entity58 oscillation can generate strong shifts in the climate patterns that could overwhelm or amplify @entity8 's typical impacts			1
" officials said the phenomenon could produce dramatic short - term swings in temperatures			0
while the opposing weather patterns are always present , it fluctuates between positive and negative phases , the agency said			1
the negative phase pushes cold air into the @entity1 from @entity71 and can result in cold snaps and snowy conditions such as the " snowmageddon " storm of 2009 , according to @entity7			2
the highlights of the @entity1 winter outlook from @entity7 include : @entity4 : colder and wetter than average			1
@entity8 often results in below - average temperatures and increased mountain snow in the @entity4 and western @entity80 during the winter months			1
this may set the stage for spring flooding in the @entity84			0
@entity85 : colder than average with odds favoring wetter than average conditions in northern @entity85 and drier than average conditions in southern @entity85			1
all of the southern part of the nation is at risk of having above normal wildfire conditions starting this winter and lasting into the spring			2
@entity0 : colder and wetter than average			1
spring flooding could be a concern in parts of this region			0
@entity0 and @entity100 states : warmer and drier than average			0
this will likely exacerbate drought conditions in these regions			1
@entity105 and south @entity106 : drier than average , with an equal chance for above - , near - , or below - normal temperatures			0
@entity110 and @entity111 valleys : wetter than average with equal chances for above - , near - , or below - average temperatures			2
potential for increased storminess and flooding			0
@entity117 and @entity118 : equal chances for above - , near - , or below - normal temperatures and precipitation			0
winter weather for these regions is often driven not by @entity8 but by the @entity58 oscillation			1
if enough cold air and moisture are in place , areas north of the @entity125 and into the @entity117 could see above - average snow			0
@entity131 : tilt toward colder and wetter than average			1
@entity134 : above - average temperatures are favored in the western islands with equal chances of above - , near - , or below average precipitation			0
statewide , the current drought is expected to continue through the winter			1
drought recovery is more likely over the windward slopes of the @entity143 and @entity144			0
@entity145 : colder than average over the southern half of the state and the panhandle with below average precipitation in the interior eastern part of the state			2
the seasonal outlook from @entity7 does not project where and when snowstorms may hit , according to weather officials			0
the snow forecasts are dependent upon winter storms which are generally not predictable more than a week in advance , they said .			0

strong @entity58 weather patterns can overwhelm or amplify @entity8
drought conditions are expected to continue in the @entity165 and @entity166
the @entity4 will be wetter and colder than average
