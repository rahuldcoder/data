@entity0 , @entity1 -- dozens died and 30 inmates escaped during a weekend prison riot in northern @entity1 , an official said monday			1
the prison 's director and 18 guards have been removed from their positions and are under investigation , @entity8 gov. @entity7 told reporters			1
" there is no doubt that without the help of prison officials , it would have been very hard to make this escape			0
... for us , it is difficult to confirm that the betrayal , corruption and complicity of a few can hinder the work of good police , soldiers and sailors who risk their lives daily for the security of @entity8 's residents , " he said			0
authorities are offering a reward of 10 million pesos ( about $ 788,000 ) for information leading to the escapees ' capture , @entity7 said			1
preliminary reports indicate the escapees were members of the @entity41 drug cartel , he said			1
a fierce rivalry between drug cartels likely fueled the fighting that killed 44 people sunday inside the prison in @entity47 , @entity8 , state security spokesman @entity48 told reporters			1
at least two @entity41 leaders , including the suspected head of the cartel in the nearby industrial city of @entity0 , were among the prisoners who escaped , according to @entity1 military records			1
prisoners could have used the riot to engineer their breakout , @entity48 said sunday			0
he did not say how prisoners inside acquired the clubs , stones and sharp objects they used in the fighting			0
earlier sunday , @entity48 said inmates had taken a guard hostage as clashes broke out at the prison			2
some prisoners also set mattresses ablaze , sending smoke rising above the facility , he said			0
@entity72 and state police surrounded the prison as anxious family members awaited information outside its gates			0
the clashes , which occurred in a part of the prison where most inmates were serving time for federal drug trafficking offenses , might have begun as a fight between the @entity41 and @entity84 cartels , @entity48 said			2
the @entity41 started with deserters from the @entity86 and quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as the armed branch of @entity1 's @entity84 cartel			1
the partnership ended in 2010 , and turf battles between the rival cartels are common in northern @entity1			1
state officials have asked @entity1 's interior ministry to transfer inmates connected with federal offenses out of the prison , which has become significantly overcrowded as authorities crack down on organized crime , @entity7 said monday			1
the @entity47 prison was housing about 3,000 prisoners at the time of sunday 's riot , @entity48 said sunday			2
last year , 14 inmates were killed and 35 people were injured in a fire in the prison 's psychiatric ward			1
nearly half of @entity1 's 428 penitentiary centers are overcrowded , according to federal police statistics			2
after more than 350 people died in a fire in a @entity118 prison last week , a @entity114 official said widespread overcrowding was one factor behind a recent wave of violence in @entity124 prisons			0
" these events reflect an alarming pattern of prison violence in the region , which is a direct consequence of -- or aggravated by -- a range of endemic problems including chronic prison overcrowding , the lack of access to basic services such as adequate floor space , potable water , food , health care and lack of basic sanitary and hygienic standards , " @entity125 , a spokesman for the high commissioner for human rights , said in a statement			0
in @entity1 , prison expert @entity145 said conditions remain ripe for more violence			2
" there are many factors , " he said			0
" there is overpopulation , there is complicity and there is a lack of security			0
" @entity2 's @entity159 in @entity160 , journalist @entity157 in @entity0 and @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
