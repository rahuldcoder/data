@entity1 's president , gen. @entity10 , has been under pressure to lift a state of emergency			1
@entity14 and @entity15 offer a variety of programming , including news , entertainment , sports and music			1

" the action was not wholly unexpected , but surprising nevertheless , @entity30 said			0
" we uplink from @entity6 , never having had a license to uplink from @entity1 , " he said			2
" @entity6 is a media city which seemed to be a haven and a sanctuary			0
" @entity30 said network officials have been in discussions with @entity1 government officials and " it seemed very obvious that they were going to do this			1
we were ready for it to a certain extent			0
" " eventually they decided to put their feet on the pipe , as it were			0
" the government has made numerous demands of the network , although none of them official , @entity30 said			0
" it 's done through intermediaries , " he said			0
" [ @entity61 ] down the content , not having certain anchors , some of the hosts of our programs and talk shows			0
" @entity10 's emergency order put several restrictions on the media , preventing journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to " the ideology ... or integrity of @entity1			1
" journalists are also restricted from covering suicide bombings and militant activity and could face three - year jail terms if they " ridicule " members of the government or armed forces			0
almost a dozen journalists have been arrested			0
@entity10 has denied that his restrictions bar criticism , saying they only ask for responsibility in reporting			2

@entity10 has said the emergency order improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections , which he has said he would like to see take place before january 9			1
the exact date will be set by @entity1 's @entity110			0
