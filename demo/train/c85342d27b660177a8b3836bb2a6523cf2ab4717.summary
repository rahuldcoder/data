" i knew i had to be more aggressive			0
my heavy forehand does n't work against him , so i had to hit it flatter , which is higher risk			0
i took really , really ridiculous cuts at a lot of forehands , " @entity1 told the @entity37 web site			1
" i took a lot of risk there in the last two sets			0
my comfort zone of moving the ball around and maybe chipping it around a little bit does n't work against @entity4			2
i had to try to come up with something that at least took him out of his comfort zone a little bit , and it paid off			0
" @entity4 was not too disheartened , having reached the semifinals in his two outings since suffering a knee injury at the @entity55 in january			2
" two semifinals in a row , first two masters 1000 of the season for me is positive , " @entity4 said			2
" positive @entity3 hardcourt season , first part			2
so , yeah , happy for that			0
" @entity9 continued his giantkilling run as he followed up his victories over world no. 1 @entity66 and 10th seed @entity67 by crushing @entity70 fifth seed @entity71 6 - 2 6 - 2			1
the @entity72 , seeded 16th , has gone one better than his last - four achievement in @entity6 last year as he qualified for only his second @entity75 final			1
" in all my matches with @entity71 in the past i 've been too defensive			0
if you give him time to hit the ball hard it 's really tough , " @entity9 said			1
" i wanted to play more aggressive , but without making mistakes			0
