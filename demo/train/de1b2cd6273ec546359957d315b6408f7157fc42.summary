@entity0 -- vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days , transforming drab urban facades into vibrant jungles of color			1
these lush expanses have found their way onto the walls -- both inside and out -- on numerous sites in recent years revitalizing public buildings , hotels , offices and even a multi-storey car park in @entity15			2
aside from their pleasing aesthetic qualities , vertical gardens could also deliver more practical benefits says @entity19 , creative director at @entity20 , a @entity21 company who design and build green walls			1
" the market is rapidly moving into looking at how they can provide eco-system services and green infrastructures for urban environments , " @entity19 said			2
their modular hydroponic system -- where plants sit in a soil - free set up with nutrients delivered through irrigation channels -- can be retrofitted to just about any wall			0
a recent creation erected on the side of @entity38 in central @entity0 is hoping to improve air quality			1

" they have taken initial samples and going at regular intervals to take leaf samples			0
then they wash these leaf samples to see how much particulate matter has adhered to the leaves , " said @entity19			0
the leaves also have an electrostatic charge that also attracts particles			0
" a researcher i was speaking to recently reckons green walls in urban canyon environments ( areas where walls are higher than the width of the road separating them ) are more effective than trees at collecting particles because the way the wind eddies around and then moves down the wall , " @entity19 said			1
some believe that in less polluted areas , green walls could be employed to grow food , which could aid urban food security			1
@entity20 have successfully trialled a wall which grew 45 varieties of vegetable			0
furthermore , there 's nothing stopping people building their own , more basic green walls at home , @entity19 says			2
there are various systems for @entity84 constructions with most requiring a compost - based system , he says , but homemade hydroponic systems can be made using plastic bottles			0
all you need is irrigation and adequate light .			0
