-- on monday , @entity2 presidential candidate @entity1 called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate a series of recent leaks that critics charge are designed to bolster the national security credentials of the @entity10 administration			1
investigations by special prosecutors can take on a life of their own			2
recall that the investigation of the @entity17 real estate deal in @entity18 -- in which @entity19 and @entity20 actually lost money -- morphed into the scandal of the @entity24 affair			0
during the @entity28 administration , @entity25 , a top aide to vice president @entity26 , was convicted not of leaking the name of @entity31 officer @entity30 but of making false statements to the @entity33 during its investigation of the leak and also perjuring himself			0
the recent leaks involve stories in the @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39 that range from the hitherto undisclosed role of the @entity41 in cyberattacks on @entity44 's nuclear facilities to details about the president 's decision - making surrounding the selection of the targets of the @entity31 drone program in @entity51 and @entity52 and the penetration by a spy of @entity56 's @entity52 affiliate			1
earlier this month , attorney general @entity57 appointed two senior @entity59 prosecutors to investigate the leaks , and the @entity33 is also investigating the matter			2
have those leaks , as @entity1 claimed on monday , " put @entity41 interests and our people in jeopardy " ? it is not only @entity2 making these charges			1
well - regarded @entity68 sen. @entity67 , who heads the powerful @entity69 , told @entity0 's @entity70 : " i think what we 're seeing , @entity70 , is an avalanche of leaks , and it is very , very disturbing			2
it 's dismayed our allies			0
it puts @entity41 lives in jeopardy			1
it puts our nation 's security in jeopardy			1
" the story that sparked these claims was @entity87 's piece in the @entity37 earlier this month about the @entity41 role in cyberattacks against @entity44 's key nuclear enrichment plant at @entity91 , revelations that also appear in @entity87 's fascinating new book , " @entity94			2
" @entity87 goes into rich detail about how computer viruses were introduced into the @entity91 plant and how they then took over the controls of the finely calibrated centrifuges that the @entity44 use to enrich their uranium , causing the centrifuges to spin wildly out of control			0
but did this really hurt @entity41 national security ? after all , the @entity44 know that their problems with the centrifuges at @entity91 are caused by cyberattacks and have publicly said so for the past two years			1
on november 29 , 2010 , @entity44 president @entity108 told reporters in @entity110 , " they succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts			0
" computer experts around the world who examined the @entity122 virus , the first computer virus that was introduced into the @entity44 nuclear program , concluded two years ago that this was a virus that was so complex that it could only have been generated by a state , and the only two states with the technical know - how and motive to write the code for such a virus were @entity134 and the @entity41			1
last year , @entity136 computer security expert @entity135 , who had discovered the @entity122 virus when it had first broken out of the @entity91 plant , told a conference in @entity139 , " my opinion is that the @entity141 is involved			1
... but , the leading source is not @entity134			0
... there is only one leading source , and that is the @entity41			2
" @entity87 's reporting about the cyberattacks on @entity44 revealed that the code name for the series of computer viruses unleashed on @entity44 's nuclear program is " @entity152 " and also laid out some of the modus operandi of the viruses themselves , but since much of this was generally known by the @entity44 regime , it is unlikely @entity41 national security was really harmed by the disclosures			1
in fact , open discussion of the cyberattacks against @entity44 is in the public interest because three questions about the attacks quickly present themselves : -- what are the downsides of cyberattacks in a world that is so interconnected by the @entity170 ? -- since it is the @entity172 's official position that a serious cyberattack against the @entity41 is a form of warfare , is the @entity41 therefore already at war with @entity44 ? -- when does a covert action against an @entity41 enemy rise to a form of warfare that it merits a broader public discussion ? according to @entity87 , his sources about @entity152 included " current and former @entity41 , @entity185 and @entity134 officials involved in the program , as well as a range of outside experts			1
" so it is fair to assume that @entity87 's reporting was hardly dependent on a particular @entity10 administration official ( or officials ) but rather , as all good reporters do , @entity87 put together a myriad of sources to arrive at the composite picture of @entity152 that he paints for his readers			0
it is therefore quite unlikely that prosecutors will find particular officials behind the leaking but rather that @entity10 officials gave @entity87 some small fragments of the @entity152 story that he was then also able to piece together with the help of his @entity134 and @entity185 sources , as well as experts on cybersecurity			0
another story that has critics of the @entity10 administration steamed is that it has allowed to become public that the president personally approves " kill lists " for @entity31 drone strikes in @entity51 and @entity52 , a story reported both by @entity216 and @entity217 in the @entity37 and by @entity218 in @entity38 and in his excellent new book about @entity10 's counterterrorism policies , " @entity221			0
" no such criticism attended the @entity28 administration 's decision to turn over to @entity225 the highly classified notes from " 50 @entity227 and other meetings " that became the basis for @entity225 's hagiographic book , " @entity230 , " about the campaign to overthrow the @entity232 during the fall of 2001			0
there is nothing of substance to the criticism that discussion of the " kill lists " endangers national security			1
after all , drone attacks are an entirely public form of supposedly secret warfare			0
a drone strike -- when a bomb or missile appears out of nowhere and incinerates some people in @entity51 's tribal areas or in @entity52 -- is a public event			2
and it 's a form of warfare that is , of course , well known to @entity56			0
the documents recovered at @entity255 's @entity254 compound in @entity51 demonstrate how worried @entity56 's leaders were about the @entity31 drone strikes			0
incidentally , the president 's being involved in making these life - or - death decisions about the fates of many hundreds of people in any given year is desirable			0
is it a preferable alternative that he should n't be involved at all ? also , discussion of the drone program is in the public interest as it 's a form of warfare that is unlikely to remain an @entity41 monopoly for much longer			1
after all , the @entity41 has only had the ability to arm its own drones for the past decade , and many other countries now possess unarmed drones of their own			1
it wo n't be long before the @entity274 and the @entity275 will be arming their own drones and precedents created by the @entity10 administration will surely be invoked by them			2
the one story that may be genuinely troubling from a national security perspective is the one written by the deeply sourced @entity281 and @entity282 at the @entity39 , who made public in may that a plot to destroy a @entity41 bound airliner using a souped - up new version of an " underwear bomb " developed by @entity56 's @entity52 branch had had been thwarted by the @entity31			1
as this story could have revealed " sources and methods " that might affect the future ability of the @entity31 or of " liaison services " working with the agency to penetrate @entity56 in @entity52 again , the precise source of this leak seems to be the most legitimate avenue of inquiry for the @entity59 and the @entity33			0
finally , is there any merit to the notion that the @entity10 administration is spilling secrets to burnish its national security record ? to help answer that question , let 's quickly recall some of that record : -- in the first two years of his presidency , @entity10 quintupled the number of @entity31 drone strikes in @entity51 , as a result more or less destroying @entity56 there			1
-- @entity10 has conducted around 40 drone strikes and airstrikes in @entity52 , compared with the @entity28 administration 's single drone strike there			0
-- one of those @entity10 drone strikes killed the @entity317 - born cleric @entity316 , which appears to be the first time an @entity41 president has authorized the assassination of a @entity41 citizen			2
-- according to reliable news reports of drone strikes in @entity51 and @entity52 , @entity10 has authorized strikes that led to the killing of at least 1,900 people , most of whom were militants but around 5 % of whom were civilians			0
( the toll of 1,900 is more than double the total number of detainees who have passed through @entity335 )			0
-- and , of course , @entity10 ordered the raid that killed @entity255 , a decision that was made against the advice of two of his most senior advisers , secretary of defense @entity340 , who had served every president going back to @entity344 , and vice president @entity345 , who was elected to the @entity69 when @entity10 was 11			0
this does not seem to be the record of a president who needs to bolster his national security credentials , something that seems to be well - understood by the @entity41 public			1
in a variety of recent polls , @entity10 and @entity1 are now running neck and neck , but a poll released this month by @entity357 shows that @entity10 beats @entity1 by 11 points on foreign policy issues and by 13 points on terrorism			2
the irony of all the ruckus about the recent leaks is that the @entity10 administration , which came to power promising more government transparency , has been the most aggressive administration in @entity41 history in its prosecution of alleged leaks to the press			1
it has invoked in six cases the rarely used @entity373 to go after @entity41 not working for foreign intelligence services but who have leaked to the media			2
by and large , the leaks are a @entity378 pseudoscandal that has n't really harmed national security but have instead helped to foster a legitimate debate about the future of drone warfare and of cyberattacks that promise to transform warfare as much as fast - moving tanks changed the face of war in the mid- 20th century .			1

@entity1 , others have called for special prosecutor on national security leaks
@entity393 : most of the info about drones , @entity122 were known by *adversaries*
he says argument that the leaks put @entity41 interests and people in jeopardy does n't hold up
@entity405 : public discussion of the *implications* of drones , computer wars is beneficial
