-- @entity1 has long been cited as one of the fastest growing economies in the world , but it has n't always been the most hospitable place for business travelers			1
ranked 132 out of 185 on the @entity9 's @entity8 , the country is often viewed as a hassle by executives			2
part of the problem is that @entity1 has grown faster than its infrastructure			1
" infrastructure that we created for 2020 are already getting filled up by 2012 , " says @entity15 , the man who is planning to bring @entity1 up to speed by 2017			1
@entity15 already revolutionized his country once			2
the instigator of the " @entity22 " campaign , he polished @entity1 's flagging tourism image and turned it into a must - visit destination for the discerning traveler			1
marketing aside , the campaign made sure journeying through the subcontinent was met with relative ease			0
roads were repaved , landmarks rebuffed and the sector as a whole was trained to work with foreign guests			0
today , the country sees 6.8 million overseas tourists annually			0
now he is tackling what may be @entity1 's most ambitious infrastructure project to date			1
the @entity40 - @entity39 , a $ 90 billion state - run enterprise , will involve connecting the 932 mile stretch between @entity40 and @entity39 with new ports , airports , highways and rail links			1
for @entity15 , though , the real achievement will be the undertaking 's economic knock - on effect			1
" the train opens up a completely new route for @entity1 , " he explains			2
" it opens up the heart of six states , and what it does is really drive manufacturing			0
it creates seven new industrial cities of @entity1 , " he explains			2
the country has already seen several new cities develop on the outskirts of industry centers			0
outside of @entity40 , for example , sits @entity65 , a 30 year old suburb with a gdp that has started to match its next - door neighbor 's			1
unfortunately , many key urban features like adequate power and sewage are only just starting to be built			0
" the city is doing some retro fitting , " admits @entity15			2
" you are seeing power lines coming up , you are seeing drainage and sewage coming up			0
" @entity15 is hoping to avoid this type of scenario with the @entity40 - @entity39			1
" you need to have a very good plan of the backbone of the city you 've created , and then allow the private sector to come in at the appropriate time , " says @entity15			2
the project may be ambitious , but @entity15 notes that its supersonic timeframe is necessary given the speed the country 's young population is growing			1
" @entity1 has a very young population ; the median age is 25 , and the aspirations are very high , " he explains			0
" we have to push for reforms at twice the speed we have been doing			0
" despite the wealth of foreign investment in @entity1 , @entity15 also notes that the drive for change is coming from within the country			1
@entity1 's middle class is 400 million strong , and @entity15 reckons that by 2021 it will account for 47 % of the country 's gdp			1
many will likely work in cities , and the number is only going to keep growing			0
" by 2030 , 350 million @entity1 are going to get into the process of urbanization , 700 million @entity1 by 2050 , " he explains			0
" @entity1 has to create two and a half @entity108			0
that is the challenge for @entity1			0

@entity40 - @entity39 *scheme* will cost $ *90b*
leading project is @entity15 , the man who lead @entity1 's *successful* tourism campaign
project seen as necessary as country 's middle class grows
speed of reform and *modernization* needs to be faster *believes* @entity15
