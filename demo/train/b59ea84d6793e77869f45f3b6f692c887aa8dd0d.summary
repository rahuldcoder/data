-- @entity0 marked a milestone monday			1
just before noon , the @ cnnbrk account topped 10 million followers on @entity4			1
that puts our @entity4 account in the company of @entity9 , president @entity10 and @entity11			1
to mark the occasion , it 's worth reflecting how we got here			0
the first tweet on @ cnnbrk was n't news , and it was n't written by an employee of @entity0			1
" testing " is what @entity18 tweeted in january 2007			2
@entity18 said he started the account as a way to receive @entity0 's breaking news alerts on his phone			1
the account started to grow and gain attention			1
journalist and fellow developer @entity27 posted this to his blog back in 2008 : " @ cnnbrk ai n't @entity0 but with > 30k followers , he owns the brand			1
" @entity18 wrote a response to that post : " i 've been in contact with @entity0 -- they wo n't sue , i 'm fairly sure , however i 'm constantly dealing with the problem of confusion -- users still think that @ cnnbrk is an official feed , therefore making me a defacto @entity0 employee , which is a problem			1
" we did n't sue , but we did work out a deal to get the handle			0
as we celebrate reaching the 10 - million - follower mark , @entity18 is the first person we should thank			1
the second person to thank , naturally , is @entity50			2
in 2009 , he challenged @entity0 to a competition to see who could first reach 1 million followers			1
at more than 13 million followers , @ aplusk is still in the lead			2
and we 're still coming after him			0
we have a simple approach to @ cnnbrk , and we believe that 's one of the keys to its success			1
breaking news , from an organization that built its brand on breaking news			0
some of our most retweeted items include colorful observations from events such as last year 's conventions , slightly offbeat news and old - fashioned big breaking news			0
this is n't to say we are n't still " testing			0
" we have n't always been first			0
it 's rare that we get it wrong , but when we do , we 've tried to be transparent about it			0
we believe that 's another key to our success			0
and we have a dash of fun on occasion			0
the @entity0 homepage team has managed @ cnnbrk for the past three years , hand - crafting every tweet , 24 - 7 , mostly from our home base in @entity91			1
they deserve the bulk of the cake and @entity95 for this latest accomplishment			0
that team is headed by @entity98 ( @ @entity99 ) , our lead homepage editor			2
@entity100 ( @ lilacina ) , our senior director for social news , is a spirit guide over all of @entity0 's social media efforts			2
" b - @entity105 , " in newsroom shorthand , is n't the only @entity4 account at @entity0			1
we have more than 100			0
our second most popular account is @ cnn , and it 's no small fry with more than 7 million followers			1
what 's the difference between @ cnnbrk and @ cnn ? on @ cnn , you 'll find breaking news -- and lots more			2
some of our biggest and brightest names and shows have active , highly followed accounts			0
many of our sections and beats , such as @ cnnopinion , have their own accounts			0
the news team at @entity4 called @ cnnbrk the " @entity9 " of news			1
some of the staff is now suggesting that we wear meat dresses to work			0
instead , we 'll thank those who got us started , tweet a thank you to all 10 million of our followers , and press on to 11 , 12 , 13 million and beyond			2
@entity100 and @entity98 contributed to this piece and deserve an extra slice of cake for their efforts .			0
