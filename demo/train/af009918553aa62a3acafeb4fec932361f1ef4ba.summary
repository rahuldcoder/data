@entity0 -- the family of @entity3 , the nation 's lone living veteran of @entity5 , hopes he makes it to his 110th birthday about a month from now , despite troubling signs he is on the decline			1
@entity3 , who was born february 1 , 1901 , is thought to be the world 's oldest living war veteran			2
@entity3 has slowed down considerably in just the past two months , according to his daughter @entity12 , who lives with him at the family home near @entity14 , in the eastern panhandle of @entity16			2
a family friend who visited two weeks ago says he is awake just a few hours a day			0
" when he 's awake , he 's there with us , " said @entity18 , a @entity19 portrait photographer who has spent the past decade documenting the final few veterans from the war that ended 92 years ago			0
with only one veteran left , @entity24 spends the remaining time helping @entity3 represent the memory of his comrades			1
despite his advanced age , @entity3 had been coming to @entity30 to try to persuade lawmakers to grant federal status to an existing @entity5 monument in @entity0 that was built in the 1930s			1
the monument currently honors only those who served from the @entity0			0
" i have to , " @entity3 told @entity1 when he came to @entity0 a year ago to testify as part of what he considers his responsibility to those who 've gone before him			1
although passed by the @entity42 , the legislation , known as the @entity41 , remains stalled in the @entity43			0
passage would bestow federal status to both the @entity0 location and another @entity5 memorial in @entity48 , @entity49			1
his family is concerned he may never live to see the bill enacted			0
last month , @entity3 was not strong enough and could not make a trip to @entity0 to review renovations as they began at the @entity55			1
the @entity56 hosted a tour showing the first real improvements in decades at the site , fixing a neglected walkway and dressing up a deteriorated dome and marble columns			0
learning of @entity3 ' decline , the office of rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , sent word to the family last week that " she would like to offer her thoughts and prayers to him , " at a time " mr. @entity3 ' health has taken a turn for the worse			1
" as an @entity76 corporal in what was known as the @entity5 , @entity3 drove an ambulance in @entity79			1
even if the monument becomes part of @entity3 ' legacy , his family is concerned the @entity83 has not fully considered what can be done to honor him after his death			2
his daughter says the @entity87 of @entity0 will support an honors burial at @entity89 , including an escort platoon , a horse - drawn casket arrival , a band and a firing party			1
she has expressed concern that @entity76 officials have told her they can not provide honor staff for any related memorial services that do n't take place at the @entity99			0
a proposal from rep. @entity101 , @entity102 , calls for ceremonies in the @entity30 , where @entity3 ' casket would be displayed with honors			0
the family is concerned they would have to bear the cost of supporting the display and that the @entity111 military would decline to participate			2
so @entity18 , the family friend who also serves as president of the @entity113 , told @entity1 he has asked @entity111 allies to help give @entity3 a proper sendoff when the time comes			1
" the @entity79 are in , " @entity18 confirmed , " they plan to send a @entity119 official , and hope to contribute at least two honor guards and pallbearers			0
" a @entity123 defense official has told the family that the @entity123 would send the air - vice marshal and possibly the @entity123 ambassador			0
" it has long been my father 's wish to be buried in @entity89 , in the same cemetery that holds his beloved general ( @entity134 ( commander of the @entity136 in @entity5 ) , " @entity12 wrote , appealing for help from sen. @entity132 , @entity133			2
" i feel confident that the right thing will come to pass			0
