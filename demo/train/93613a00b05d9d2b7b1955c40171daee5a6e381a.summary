@entity0 , @entity1 -- amid the overwhelming flood disaster in @entity1 , the world has " no choice but to be optimistic and to have hope " that things can improve there , actress and humanitarian @entity10 told @entity2 wednesday			1
@entity10 is in the country as the personal envoy of @entity13 high commissioner for refugees @entity14			1
she spoke to @entity2 from @entity0 after touring flood - hit areas of @entity1 , including the northwest @entity18 region			1
she described meeting a couple in their 70s who live on a pension and who watched as floodwater destroyed the family home they had worked hard to build			0
" the woman is so embarrassed with her situation , and the man spoke of the fact that he never felt in his lifetime he is ever going to be able to recuperate what he 's lost -- that he would never again have nice things , he would never have a nice bed , a nice house , " @entity10 told @entity2			2
" they lived in this place since 1972 and raised their children and their grandchildren there			0
and in a moment , a few hours , it was completely gone			0
" she said the area the couple lived in is now covered in mud and dirt , with feces in the fly - covered river nearby , all because of the floods			2
" it does n't have the dignity that they deserve to live in -- anybody deserves to live in , " @entity10 said			2
the couple lives in the village of @entity58 , where some 70 percent of the homes were destroyed or badly damaged by the swirling floodwater , according to the @entity61			0
the death toll in the country has climbed to 1,738 , the @entity62 said over the weekend			0
almost 21 million people have been affected by the flooding , @entity65 , the new @entity13 emergency relief coordinator , said monday			1
water - borne illnesses from contaminated floodwaters have erupted nationwide			2
at least 1 million @entity1 have crippling diarrhea or respiratory infections , and about 65,000 cases of malaria have been reported			1
@entity10 's visit is intended to highlight the suffering of the millions of flood victims and the need for continuing aid for the displaced			1
one reason relatively few people have paid attention to the suffering in @entity1 , @entity10 said , may be disaster fatigue			1
she pointed out @entity1 has endured several disasters in recent years , including an earthquake in 2005 that killed more than 70,000 people			1
" we tend to focus on one issue at a time , because that seems to be what people can absorb and care for , " she said			0
she added that it 's difficult to convey the story of the disaster in @entity1 , and that even she had no idea what she would face			2
" when i was standing in one of the houses , it was nine feet tall , the water			0
it was not a flood that made everything wet for a ( while )			0
it washed away children right out of their parents ' hands			0
" @entity10 said she would want people to remember this : " they are people			1
they are family , and lovely , lovely , hard - working people and beautiful children , and they deserve dignity and assistance , and we have to treat them with respect and try to preserve what we can of their livelihood and their future			2
" the @entity1 people are resilient and will move on , @entity10 said , but she urged international support to help them do that			1
" i think we have no choice but to be optimistic and to have hope , " she said			0
" i think without that , we are just lost , and things deteriorate			0
