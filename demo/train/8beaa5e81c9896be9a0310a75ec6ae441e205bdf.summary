-- tonight , tuesday , june 5 , as the sun set on the @entity7 , the planet @entity2 began its " transit " across the face of the sun. pay close attention : barring a miracle of future medicine , this is your only chance to witness such a crossing			1
the next one will take place in 2117			1
that 's because the transit of @entity2 is basically an eclipse , just like when the moon passes across the face of the sun. it requires a close alignment of the sun , @entity2 and @entity22			1
the moon is not nearly as large as @entity2 but it is so close to @entity22 that its disk covers nearly the entire solar disk			1
@entity2 , on the other hand , is so far away that it appears as a small black dot covering about 3 % of the solar disk			1
@entity2 orbits the sun every 226 @entity22 - days , compared to our 365 days , so the two planets sort of pass each other relatively often			2
but their orbits lie in slightly canted planes , so the alignment needed for an eclipse happens only once a century or so			1
nearly 500 years ago , @entity38 figured out the orbits of the planets			0
he understood that @entity2 was 30 % closer to the sun than @entity22 , and that @entity42 was 50 % more distant			2
but he did n't know how to measure the distance from any planet to the sun. a century after @entity46 , @entity47 , of comet fame , proposed measuring the distance from @entity22 to the sun using a series of observations of the transit of @entity2 from widely separated points on @entity22			1
@entity47 did not live to measure the next transit of @entity2 , in 1761 , but others mounted worldwide expeditions that did the trick			1
the best measurements of that transit were made by @entity61 and @entity62 , of @entity64 - line fame			2
today , we can measure interplanetary distances far more accurately than the transit method allows , though amateurs can still contribute their measurements using an app from @entity71			2
as for the specialness of the transit , well , it 's rarer than passages of mr. @entity47 's famous comet			2
the transit of @entity2 ca n't be observed with the @entity78 because the extreme brightness of the sun would destroy the telescope and its instruments			1
but astronomers have figured out a clever way for @entity78 to " observe " the effects of the transit on the light from the sun : by looking at the moon			0
the moon " shines " in reflected sunlight , so it is basically a weak mirror that is safe for @entity78 to observe			0
the reason astronomers want to observe reflected sunlight during the transit of @entity2 is to test whether they can detect the faint imprint of passage of the sun 's light through the atmosphere of @entity2			1
they have used similar observations of more distant stars to find " exoplanets " ( planets orbiting stars other than the sun ) and in a few rare cases , to measure characteristics of the exoplanet atmospheres			0
the goal of the @entity78 observations is to find signs of life and / or habitability , such as water or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere			0
@entity78 will focus its cameras on the moon for the full six hours of the transit of @entity2			1
so the transit of @entity2 is now being used to help us learn about other @entity121			1
@entity2 is the second closest planet to the sun , after @entity124 ; @entity22 is third ; @entity42 is fourth			2
that means only @entity124 and @entity2 ( and our moon ) can cause eclipses from a vantage point on the @entity22			2
but if we lived on @entity130 , @entity22 and @entity42 could also be seen ( rarely ! ) transiting across the sun. here is the poor man 's way to " see " the transit of the @entity22 across the sun : look with the @entity78 at @entity130 in 2014 , to see the reflected light of the sun from @entity130 's surface			0
( the light falling on @entity130 , and being reflected from there , is what we would see if we lived on @entity130			0
the sun is too bright for @entity78 to observe directly			0
) those @entity78 measurements would reveal whether signs of life on @entity22 -- signs of us ! -- are detectable in starlight as a planet with an atmosphere transits across the star			0
@entity151 , professor at the @entity152 , points out that @entity22 can be seen transiting the sun from many vantage points throughout our galaxy			0
if there is intelligent life out there , maybe it is looking for signs of life on @entity22 from such transits			0
you may have witnessed the last transit of @entity2 in 2004			1
but the one before that was visible only to your great - great - grandparents , on december 6 , 1882			0
as @entity165 ( 1837 - 1903 ) , then director of the @entity167 , said on the eve of the 1882 transit : " there will be no other transits of @entity2 ' til the 21st century of our era has dawned upon the @entity22			1
when the last transit occurred the intellectual world was awakening from the slumber of ages , and that wondrous scientific activity , which has led to our present advanced knowledge , was just beginning			0
what will be the state of science when the next transit season arrives @entity185 only knows			0
not even our children 's children will live to take part in the astronomy of that day			0
" you are in that day , another age of wondrous scientific activity			0
what will the world of your great - great grandchildren be like in 2117 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			1

@entity198 says we should take the chance to view @entity2 ' transit
the alignment needed for the event happens only once a century or so
the next one will take place in 2117 , she says
