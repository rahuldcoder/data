-- in my family , i 'm always bringing up stories from the past , our family 's story , our diversity			1
my daughter often rolls her eyes			0
" we do n't need to keep talking about this stuff			0
" we know ! " in truth , their schools have done of a good job trying to make their population more closely resemble our country and our world			1
my kids have friends of all races , cultures and social classes			0
however , as a female white mom married to a male white dad with two biologically conceived white children , i 'm trying to make a different point			1
i want them to understand that light skin color is not the norm from which everyone differs			0
@entity33 is not the signifier of normal			1
many white kids take diversity for granted			1
they have worked hard to overcome stereotypes and bias and to accept other people as different			1
the fact that they may be someone else 's diversity rarely occurs to them , let alone most white adults			1
three influences have altered my white - centric perspective : my psychology students , the people with whom i work in my clinical practice and the diversity work of both my kids ' @entity54 private schools			1
some of my psychology students wanted to write a children 's book where every character had a different identity			1
children 's books generally feature characters of one race or ethnicity , not multiple identities in interaction with one another			1
when we finished our first draft , we realized our characters had become very close friends			0
they each came from a different place but everyone had came from somewhere			0
skin color does n't define personhood , but since race is a marker of identity in our society , the experience of personhood includes having to deal with the meanings others attribute to racial identity			1
protected by the privacy of a clinical relationship , beautiful black and brown women have shared how ugly they feel			0
gentle dark - skinned men convey the humiliation that overcomes them when white people mistake them for dangerous criminals			1
since whiteness has become synonymous with a better life , it is easy for any lighter - skinned person to use skin color as a shield against hurtful stereotypes about social class , gender , sexuality , family history or even mental illness			0
when white people deny their own embarrassing identity markers , we perpetuate the hypocrisy that only people of color have these problems			1
as a psychologist -- no , as a person -- recognizing status and identity anxiety as a mutual experience lifts the veil that ordinarily separates us from each other			0
this year , the parents association at one of my kids ' schools named me co-chair of the diversity committee			1
i felt so self - conscious			0
group leadership called forth a greater reckoning with my identity than simply participating in a committee			0
it also provided me the chance to experience being a minority member of a group			0
sometimes i sat as the only white person at the table feeling really insecure , worried that i would be seen as a white stereotype instead of as myself			1
how did growing up white with financial struggles intersect with racial diversity ? when white people want to " help " people of color , it always reeks of privilege and entitlement as in , " let me help you with your problems			1
" it 's a different sentiment than " let 's help each other with our problems			2
" did people of color trust me ? did they wonder what i was doing on the diversity committee ? was it my job to speak for the concerns of underrepresented minorities ? or did i contribute more by trying to put forth a more multifaceted approach to the question of identity ? how can we sit with each other 's differences without feeling compelled to rank one way of being or looking as being better or worse than the other ? our diversity committee ultimately worked through these questions in our conversations			2
although we did not fully answer them , we found that by talking about them , we discovered the theme of our work and developed a friendship			2
i now look at diversity as something that is in my interest : i want to live in a society where dignified difference constitutes our common core			1
nuances in how we think , feel , work and love define what it means to be human			2
everyone is unusual and unique			0
racism is just another word for hating our realness			0
our commonality as a country derives from the fact that we all have an identity just beneath the surface of our skins			0
the variety of stories that inhabit the people who call this country home -- from the brutality of slavery to the flight from genocides to the call to some better god -- enable democracy 's creative synergy			1
the hands that have built the instruments of modern @entity208 have been every color , every nationality and every religion			0
i want to be part of a world that loves and embraces humanity as a diverse and interconnected organism			0
i want to be part of a world that accepts that every difference has a color , and every color has a unique meaning			2
how do i do this ? i realized that it starts at home			0
rather than teaching my kids that they are white , i want to impart to them that they are part of a kaleidoscope -- lots of continually shifting colors and shapes			2
they do n't always want to hear their parents tell another story about grandpa 's poverty or the coal - mining relatives			2
but this history holds our family 's painful and joyous truths			2
every family need only peel back the layers of a few generations to find their own story			0
authentic family history exposes everyone 's diversity			2
a society that embraces uniqueness loves the messiness of the human condition			2
being loved despite or because of our messy truths creates empathy rather than sympathy			0
when we raise children to accept and acknowledge their own story , they learn to listen to someone else 's , with respect			1
