-- missed it by that much ! in a year that forecasters said there would be a few more hurricanes than normal , @entity5 on wednesday fell just a few hours short of setting a record for the latest first hurricane to form in the @entity8			1
normally , three hurricanes would have formed in the area by this time in hurricane season			1
all that it had to do was wait until after 8 a.m. et , but alas , no. three hours ahead of that mark , the @entity12 in @entity13 dubbed it a legitimate storm with sustained winds of a 75 mph , the threshold for a hurricane			0
but it 's not likely to cause much of a fuss			0
early wednesday , it was about 310 miles west - northwest of the @entity22 , off @entity24 's coast			2
it 's expected to fizzle into a tropical storm over the weekend			0
back in may , the @entity27 said higher - than - average water temperatures were expected to help yield a few more @entity8 hurricanes than usual			1
@entity30 predicts above - normal @entity8 hurricane season between 13 and 20 named storms and seven to 11 hurricanes were predicted			1
@entity5 is the eighth named storm of the year and , again , just the first hurricane			2
for the @entity8 , a normal season would produce 12 named storms , including six hurricanes and three major ones			0
there 's still time , if you 're rooting for more hurricanes			0
hurricane season , which began on june 1 , runs until november 30			1
