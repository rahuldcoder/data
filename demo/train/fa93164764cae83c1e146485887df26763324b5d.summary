-- the biggest occasion in their 81 - year history is approaching for minnows @entity4 but the @entity6 final might prove an unwelcome distraction in their battle to retain @entity11 status			1
a crushing 3 - 2 home defeat to @entity13 on tuesday left the plucky club from the north west staring at relegation to @entity18 's second tier after eight years of defying the odds			1
@entity21 's side , famous for miraculous escapes in previous years , now find themselves three points adrift of safety with just two games remaining			2
it means their clash with @entity28 in @entity18 's premier domestic cup competition at @entity30 on saturday could be their last slice of the limelight for some time			1
conversely , @entity28 warmed up for the showpiece final with a 1 - 0 win over @entity35 , that edged them towards a second place finish behind champions @entity38			1
@entity4 had taken the lead over @entity13 , nestled safely in mid table , thanks to a volley from @entity43 but shortly after halftime @entity44 equalized with an equally smart volley			1
@entity47 restored @entity4 's lead finishing off a fine move but then @entity4 shot themselves in the foot with some sloppy defending which has blighted their season			1
first a poor pass from @entity53 allowed @entity54 to level things at 2 - 2 before a mix up in the six - yard box allowed @entity58 to scramble home the winning goal			2
with a trip to @entity62 and a home clash with @entity64 left , @entity4 now have a mountain to climb , but @entity21 tried to remain positive			2
" today the number of injuries we have had at the back shows and there are key moments that affected us , " @entity21 told @entity66			0
" we conceded sloppy goals with bad decisions and that 's very unfortunate because you could see the effort of the players and the desire to want to win the game			0
" emotionally today was such a difficult game for us and when you concede such goals in a soft manner then it is hard to recover			0
" it 's a missed opportunity			0
we 've got incredible character and we 're determined to fight for every single point there is left			0
" city rested several players ahead of the cup final and their winner came from @entity94 striker @entity93			2
it moved them seven points clear of third placed @entity97			0
@entity98 told reporters : " it was a difficult game because we changed a lot of players but it was important for us to win the game			0
" after 10 minutes we started to play better and we missed five incredible chances to score which made it difficult for us in the second half			0
" in @entity109 , @entity108 missed the chance to draw level on points with fifth - placed @entity113 in @entity114 after they lost to @entity115			1
@entity116 scored the only goal of the game in the final minute of the match to move @entity115 into 12th position .			1

@entity6 finalists @entity28 and @entity4 suffer mixed fortunes in @entity11
@entity28 beat @entity35 1 - 0 but @entity4 lose crucial match with @entity13
@entity4 's hopes of *avoiding* relegation now look slim ahead of saturday 's @entity6 final
