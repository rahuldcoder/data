but while the 49 - year - old @entity13 works out that project , it is the @entity15 that he hopes will continue to draw attention to the best of the continent 's culture and diversity			1

my goodness , talk about @entity56 just opening up ! " @entity1 went on to work as a journalist in the @entity34 for @entity58 and later was involved in distributing @entity34 tv shows to @entity2			1

" for me it was something that i believed in , and i was proud			0
to see a channel carrying the name of my continent and people wonder why you love @entity2 so much			1
i say this is where i was born and raised			0
my roots are in @entity2			2
that 's where i developed			0
my personality that i carry today came from home , " @entity75 told @entity0			0
