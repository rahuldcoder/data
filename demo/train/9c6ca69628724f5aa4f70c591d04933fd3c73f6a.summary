a @entity16 grand jury last week indicted 35 educators from the district , including principals , teachers and testing coordinators			1
they were ordered to turn themselves in by tuesday , district attorney @entity22 said			1
by 10:00 p.m. , 27 of 35 educators had turned themselves in at the @entity25 to face charges including racketeering , theft by taking and making false statements about their roles in an alleged plot to falsify students ' standardized tests			1
eight of them had been released on bond late tuesday , the @entity34 said			2
in 2009 , @entity8 was named the @entity38 by the @entity39 , which at the time said her " leadership has turned @entity13 into a model of urban school reform			1
" grand jury indicts 35 in @entity46 school cheating scandal but the indictment paints another picture of @entity8 , one of a superintendent with " a single - minded purpose , and that is to cheat , " @entity22 told reporters last week			1
according to the indictment , @entity8 placed unreasonable goals on educators and " protected and rewarded those who achieved targets by cheating			1
" it also alleges she fired principals who failed to achieve goals and " ignored suspicious " test score gains throughout the school system			0
her bond was reduced from $ 7.5 million to $ 200,000 , the @entity34 reported			2
on tuesday , bond was set at $ 1 million for @entity65 , a testing coordinator at @entity67 , @entity68 , a testing coordinator at @entity70 , and @entity71 , a @entity1 assistant principal			1
bond amounts were set by grand jurors			2
others who turned themselves in included testing coordinators , teachers and an instructional coach , said @entity78 spokeswoman @entity78			2
investigations into the remarkable improvements on standardized tests were first reported by @entity83 newspaper			0
a state review determined that some cheating had occurred in more than half the district 's elementary and middle schools			1
about 180 teachers were implicated initially			0
cheating is believed to date back to early 2001 , when standardized testing scores began to turn around in the 50,000 - student school district , according to the indictment			1
for at least four years , between 2005 and 2009 , test answers were altered , fabricated and falsely certified , the indictment said			0
" we 've had cheating all up and down the line			0
it was absolutely amazing , " said @entity98 , a former @entity46 attorney general who investigated the cheating scandal			0
@entity98 said there were cheating parties , erasures in and out of classrooms , and teachers were told to make changes to tests			0
" anything that you can imagine that could involve cheating , it was done			0
" during the investigation , he heard that educators cheated out of pride , to earn bonuses , to enhance their careers or to keep their jobs , he said			0
some teachers , overcome with emotion , fainted during his interview with them , he said			0
" not only were the children deprived , a lot of teachers were forced into cheating , forced into criminal acts , " @entity98 said			0
" now , granted , they did wrong , but a lot of them did this to protect jobs			0
" educators and community members reacted tuesday to the charges			2
" the @entity13 school community is obviously very upset about this , " said @entity135 , @entity1 ' executive director of communications			2
" i do n't want to pass judgment on the people , but we 've had a lot of parents who wanted to express their disappointment			0
" in a statement , @entity144 president @entity143 and @entity145 of teachers president @entity147 wrote : " we do not condone cheating under any circumstances			0
academic achievement can never be separated from academic integrity , which is why the @entity145 of teachers was the first whistle - blower to expose @entity13 testing irregularities			1
