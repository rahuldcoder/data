@entity0 wears his political ambition for all to see			1
look no further than the tie he sported during a three - day trip to @entity5			1
it had yellow images of corn , the crop that epitomizes politics in the first - in - the - nation caucus state			0
" and by coincidence , i have one in the shape of @entity17 , " the @entity13 @entity12 said wednesday , drawing laughs			0
he was speaking at a @entity12 breakfast outside @entity19 at @entity20 , a @entity21 restaurant chain where the waiters wear overalls and drinks are served in @entity26 jars			0
as @entity0 blitzed across the @entity27 this week , holding events at @entity30 offices and campaigning for local candidates , he hardly played coy to the question of whether he was running for president			1
after all , his nine - city trip marked his fourth visit to the state since the 2012 election			1
" i do n't know why @entity27 keeps popping up on my calendar , but it seems to be pretty frequent , " he said monday , clearly with sarcasm			1
his itinerary this time included a campaign - style schedule where he continued testing his 2016 message on the road			0
from reducing the federal deficit to defending civil liberties and reforming the criminal justice system , @entity0 mostly stayed on his talking points			1
but the trip was not without controversy			2
his combative answer to a reporter 's question -- combined with video of @entity0 appearing to avoid an immigration activist — absorbed most of the attention surrounding his visit			2
experts say it 's unlikely those story lines will derail any progress @entity0 has made in the state with voters , but his comments could underscore questions some @entity12 have about his foreign policy , especially as he seeks to broaden his appeal			1
off - message at his first stop on monday , which actually took place in @entity73 , @entity74 , near the @entity5 state line , @entity0 held a news conference after touring a tech startup venue with @entity79 hopeful @entity78			1
asked if he still supported phasing out foreign aid to @entity81 , @entity0 fired back at a reporter for " mischaracterizing " his position and staunchly denied that he had ever proposed such legislation			1
but it 's well - documented that he called for ending all foreign aid , including assistance to @entity81 , and sought support in @entity88 for his proposal in 2011			1
in @entity5 , @entity0 stressed that he never introduced legislation that solely " targeted " @entity81 and argued that he strongly favors sending money to the country			1
still , he added , @entity81 will be better positioned in the long run without foreign assistance			0
" every country ultimately would be better off to be independent , " he said on tuesday			0
@entity0 is also taking heat for quickly exiting a tense moment when an immigration activist confronted rep. @entity98 at a fundraiser while the two lawmakers ate dinner monday night			2
video of the incident shows @entity0 , at the behest of his press aide , quickly getting up from the table and getting away from the confrontation			2
@entity0 said he was stepping away to do interviews with local media			2
whether or not those interviews were hastened because of the activist is unclear			0
still , the video quickly spread and it was enough for critics to frame a narrative that @entity0 bolted from an uncomfortable exchange			2
the dust - ups in his trip made headlines and ate up much of the coverage of his @entity5 visit			1
@entity120 , @entity121 's @entity27 strategist in 2008 and 2012 , said he doubts caucus voters will judge @entity0 negatively for leaving after " someone tried to sandbag him			1
" " i think he 's fine on that , " he said			0
" as for @entity81 , that 's a little more difficult			0
you have social conservatives in @entity5 who very much feel the need to be in solidarity with @entity81 -- not just @entity132 conservatives , but it 's also national security conservatives			1
" while @entity0 has voted in favor of sending more aid to @entity81 this year and has proposed cutting off aid to the @entity138 , his past statements and views on foreign policy are rooted in his libertarian leanings — a perspective still largely outside of mainstream @entity12 thought			1
" he 'll probably have work to do on that issue , " @entity120 continued			0
" it could be one of those things that might limit his potential			0
" still , @entity120 thinks @entity0 is the current frontunner in @entity5 among prospective candidates			1
he points to @entity0 's frequent travel to the state , his efforts to build a wider @entity30 , and the network of supporters built by his father 's presidential campaigns the past two cycles			1
' @entity161 ' in the 2012 @entity27 caucuses , former rep. @entity162 of @entity163 finished with 21 % of the vote , just slightly behind @entity121 and former sen. @entity166 — who tied for first at 25 %			2
many of @entity162 's supporters were previously inactive in politics , citing a lack of candidates who represented their views			0
" your father cured my apathy , " one man told @entity0 at an event in @entity175			2
building off @entity162 's 2012 momentum , the so - called liberty faction of @entity5 's @entity12 eventually took control of party leadership			1
@entity185 , with the support of @entity5 gov. @entity184 , wrestled back control earlier this year			2
but @entity0 knows he needs more than just the libertarian wing of the party			2
as seen in his trip this week , he 's going after the state 's social conservatives and business republicans , too			1
" @entity0 is attempting to pivot from being ' @entity161 , ' so to speak , " said @entity193 , professor of politics at @entity195 in @entity19			2
" he 's never going to deny that or reject it			0
but he has the view that @entity12 need a broader base or broader range than some other candidates have maintained			0
" @entity0 spoke at five @entity30 offices this week and five other events in a tour that took him around the state in a 730 - mile loop			1
at each stop , @entity0 's main message sought to counter post- 2012 perceptions that the @entity12 should change its message			2
" i say ' hell no. ' we have to be more boldly for what we 're for , " he said at the @entity30 office in @entity212			0
it 's a mantra he has repeated in his travels across the country this year			0
but he proposes doing so with some traditional and unorthodox ideas for mainstream republicans			0
part of that includes a push to speak out against domestic surveillance programs and mount a strong defense of the @entity226			0
he has also been aggressive in courting voters and even @entity228 to help expand the party			0
to do that , he 's urging for reform to the criminal justice system with reduced sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and the restoration of voting rights to nonviolent felons after they get out of jail			0
in @entity5 , home to many of the state 's social conservatives , @entity0 placed an evangelical spin on his message			1
" many of us are @entity132 , we believe in a second chance in our religion			0
anybody here who 's not a sinner , raise their hand , " he said monday night at a fundraiser in @entity249			0
" we believe in redemption , should the law allow people a second chance			0
" but that 's about as deep as @entity0 waded into social issues during the trip			1
he did n't talk about abortion , contraception or same - sex marriage until audience members asked him about the issues at one of his final events			2
asked whether he supported a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage , @entity0 said he " favors the concept " of traditional marriage but argued the federal government should stay out marriage entirely			1
" i do n't want to register my guns in @entity275 or my marriage , " he said			0
the previous past two winners of @entity27 caucuses , @entity166 and @entity279 , both ran on a vocal platform with regard to social issues			1
@entity193 said if @entity0 does n't devote more attention to those topics , someone else will step in to fill in the void			1
" to function in @entity5 he 's going to have to address the concerns of conservative evangelicals because @entity290 and @entity291 are going to do that , " he said			0
@entity0 left @entity5 before this weekend 's annual summit hosted by the @entity294 , a group that 's influential with social conservatives in the state			1
guest speakers include @entity291 , @entity279 , @entity166 , @entity163 gov. @entity298 and @entity300 gov. @entity299			0
@entity0 said he could n't make it due to a scheduling conflict			1
but he indicated he 'd be back			0
" you have to meet people four , five , six times in @entity5 because they expect a real personal touch , and i think it 's actually one of the good things about the process , " he told reporters , before needlessly adding : " if i decide to do this			0

@entity0 made a high - profile trip to @entity5 this week
@entity27 is a magnet for presidential hopefuls
@entity0 made headlines for changing his tune on foreign aid
experts say the controversy is n't a deal breaker , but he still needs social conservatives
