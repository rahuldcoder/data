@entity3 @entity2 is worried that @entity6 governments are being " too wimpy " in dealing with @entity8 president @entity7 , @entity1 's mayor @entity0 said friday			1
@entity0 , on a trade mission to the @entity10 , said that he was struck by the former secretary of state 's insistence that @entity6 must do more to stand up to the @entity8 leader over @entity14			1
" one thing in particular she really wanted to get across -- that was she thought the @entity6 were being too wimpy in dealing with @entity7 , " @entity0 said , at a @entity16 event in @entity3			1
stressing he was not quoting @entity23 word for word , two days after meeting her in @entity21 , @entity0 said that he was impressed by the likely @entity27 presidential candidate 's " brilliant mastery " of foreign policy			1
" she thought in particular that we in @entity30 should be less dependent on @entity8 hyrdrocarbons and she thought we should get on with seeking alternative sources , " @entity0 said			2
" her general anxiety was that @entity7 , if unchallenged and unchecked , would continue to expand his influence in the perimeter of what was the @entity38			0
she spoke of alarm in @entity40 and the @entity41			0
i was very , very struck by that			0
" " i was struck by the firmness with which she wanted us in @entity30 to stick it , to take it to @entity7 , " he said , once again underlining he was not using @entity23 's exact words but offering a " brutal summary " of what she said			2
@entity0 , who is known for his scruffy shock of blond hair and colorful turn of phrase , said @entity23 backed president @entity57 's strategy on tackling @entity58 and thought there was more everybody could be doing to support @entity62 forces fighting the extremist group			1
the mayor , who recently visited @entity62 areas in @entity66 , quipped that he would not overstate the danger of his trip -- in a reference to @entity71 newsman @entity70 who was suspended for six months for exaggerating his experiences during the @entity66 war			0
" you get in trouble over here			0
. i was nearish to the front line			0
i would n't say bullets were wanging over my head			0
" @entity0 also said that @entity23 was " particularly gracious and charming " in their meeting , considering his comments about her in a @entity84 article in 2007 in which he accused her of " purse - lipped political correctness " and said she reminded him of a " sadistic nurse in a mental hospital			1
" " she was so nice and so kind that even in that article she found something to agree with , " he said friday			0
@entity0 also weighed in on the controversy stoked up by a possible @entity93 presidential candidate @entity92 who said in @entity1 last month after the @entity95 terror attacks that @entity97 communities had made parts of the @entity30 capital and other @entity6 cities " no go areas " for people who did not share their faith			1
he said that @entity104 gov. @entity92 and those who shared his views were in need of some " gentle education " on the issue			2
" i would be more than happy personally to escort governor @entity92 around any area of @entity1 that he thinks is a no go zone			1
it really is n't true , it is complete nonsense ... there are no no go zones and nor will there be			0
" the flamboyant @entity0 , while remaining mayor of @entity1 , is running for a seat in parliament at the next @entity30 general election in may , and has long been tipped as a future leader of the @entity123 and possible future prime minister .			2

@entity0 says @entity23 wants *tougher* @entity6 *response*
also *slams* @entity92 ' no go zone ' comments as " nonsense "
