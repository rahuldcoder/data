@entity0 , the @entity2 magazine targeted by gunmen who killed journalists and police in a brazen lunchtime attack wednesday , is no stranger to controversy			1
the @entity10 - based weekly satirical publication , which was founded in 1970 , became famous for its risqu√© cartoons and daring takedowns of politicians , public figures and religious symbols of all faiths			1
and although the motive behind wednesday 's massacre is not yet clear , @entity0 's notorious cartoons satirizing the @entity18 in recent years have angered some @entity21 and made it a target for attacks			1
" everybody knows them when you work in journalism , " said @entity25 , a journalist who was just 200 meters from @entity0 's central @entity10 office when the shooting began			1
" they have marked @entity2 journalism forever with their drawings and their cover stories			0
" a reputation for controversy in november 2011 @entity0 's office was burned down on the same day the magazine was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at @entity43 law			1
the cover cartoon depicted a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of the @entity18 with a bubble saying , " 100 lashes if you 're not dying of laughter			1
" in september 2012 , despite the ongoing global furor over the anti-islam film " @entity52 , " the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked @entity18 , along with a cover that appeared to depict @entity18 being pushed in a wheelchair by an @entity57			1
@entity2 and @entity59 officials expressed dismay with the decision , and @entity2 closed embassies and schools in about 20 countries temporarily as a precaution			2
@entity0 journalist @entity66 defended the magazine at the time , saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence			1
" the aim is to laugh , " @entity66 told @entity71 in 2012			0
" we want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist			0
they can be @entity21 , @entity77 , @entity78			0
everyone can be religious , but extremist thoughts and acts we can not accept			2
" " in @entity2 , we always have the right to write and draw			0
and if some people are not happy with this , they can sue us and we can defend ourselves			0
that 's democracy , " @entity66 said			2
" you do n't throw bombs , you discuss , you debate			0
but you do n't act violently			0
we have to stand and resist pressure from extremism			2
" massacre at editorial meeting @entity0 's last tweet before wednesday 's attack featured a cartoon of @entity98 leader @entity97 seemingly sending out his wishes for the new year with the words " and , above all , health			1
" police surveillance had reportedly been fairly tight around the magazine 's office until recently , and there had been 24 - hour surveillance of the premises before that , according to @entity1 's @entity109 in @entity10			1
@entity109 said the staff of @entity0 , which publishes weekly on wednesday , were in their lunchtime editorial meeting when the gunmen stormed the building			1
among the dead are editor @entity115 along with @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , known as " @entity119 " -- some of @entity2 's " most talented cartoonists , " according to @entity2 journalist @entity121			2
@entity122 , the @entity10 - based foreign editor of @entity123 , said @entity0 is a small publication that packs a big punch			1
" it does n't have a huge readership , but it has always had a very controversial approach to the news , " @entity122 told @entity1			0
" to see it silenced this way , especially after it survived a firebombing of its headquarters three years ago , is really reprehensible			0
" thousands of people took to social media in the attack 's aftermath to express solidarity with @entity0 , posting images with the words " @entity140 " in white on a black background , or paying tributes to the magazine on @entity144 using the # @entity146 hashtag			1
some considered cartoons blasphemous any depiction of @entity43 's prophet is considered blasphemy by many @entity21			2
@entity2 has the largest @entity21 population in @entity151 , with an estimated 4.7 million followers of the faith			0
@entity2 , which is known for its stark separation of church and state , angered some @entity21 in 2011 when it banned full - face @entity43 veils like the burqa , claiming they were degrading and a security risk			0
@entity0 is far from the only publication whose depiction of @entity18 sparked controversy			1
newspapers in @entity163 and @entity164 prompted furious demonstrations around the world in 2005 when they ran @entity18 cartoons			2
several cartoonists were attacked in the fallout of that controversy			0
@entity172 's @entity171 got death threats after drawing @entity18 with the body of a dog			1
and a man tried to break into @entity164 cartoonist @entity178 's house after he portrayed @entity18 wearing a turban shaped like a bomb			2
@entity181 reacts on wednesday , @entity2 president @entity181 reacted to the news : " @entity2 is today facing a shock , the shock a of a terror attack , because this is a terrorist attack without a doubt , against a publication that was threatened several times and that was protected			0
" " in these moments we have to form a block to show we are a united country			0
we know how to react appropriately , with firmness , but always with the concern for national unity			0
