-- @entity1 is an actor , writer , director , stand - up comedian , and , of course , @entity8 's amoral manager on " @entity2 " ( not to mention @entity10 's " fat f — " of a husband on the same )			1
beginning this thursday , the funnyman will add " podcaster " to his resumé when " by the way , in conversation " with @entity1 debuts on the @entity14			1
as its name implies , the show features @entity1 yakking it up with a series of notable acquaintances , including @entity8 himself , who guests on the first episode			1
below , the jovial @entity1 talks about his podcast , the future of @entity2 , and why it is his patriotic duty to work again with @entity30			1
@entity0 : you 've been recording these conversation - shows at the @entity34 club @entity33 for a while now			2
what exactly can people expect from the podcast ? @entity1 : i 've been doing these for a little over a year			1
we were recording them knowing we were going to do something with them but we had no plans			2
people kept on asking me , " what are you going to do with these ? " and i always said , " i have no idea			2
" and then @entity49 presented to me a great opportunity so i went with it			2
it 's me and my special guest , whoever they may be , in conversation			1
it 's not an interview per se , like you 're interviewing me			1
when someone 's career comes up — which it always does — it comes up in natural conversation , it 's not specifically to promote anything			1
are you saying you 're better than me , sir ? no. different			2
[ @entity65 ] i 'm not an interviewer			2
that 's not what i do			1
but i am good at conversation			2
and , at worst , the people who do my show are acquaintances			1
i 've never had anybody that i did n't know			2
actually , that 's not true			1
@entity74 , which is one of my favorite episodes , i did n't really know him before i talked to him			2
no , they 're great fun and we talk about so many different things			2
for me , it 's really enjoyable and the audience seems to dig it too			1
' @entity85 ' adding more episodes to new season was it easy to get @entity8 to appear ? as a fan of @entity2 myself , i imagine him coming up with an endless stream of excuses to not do it			1
well , if it was n't me , odds are he would n't appear			2
he did this for me			0
he did @entity97 's internet show			1
but if you 're not a close friend of his , the odds of getting him are pretty nil			0
i listened to a clip of the first show and was fascinated to learn that you once worked with @entity30 on the " @entity107			1
i worked with @entity30 and she 's a huge @entity2 fan			1
that kind of blew my mind			0
she knew every single episode and she was nervous about meeting me			0
that was really a thrill			0
who does n't love @entity30 ? i have to say that i met her a couple of years ago and did fall slightly under her spell			0
of course ! that 's what i 'm saying			1
it was really quite fun to work with her			0
i hope i work with her again			0
i guess the way i could work with her again is if i cast her in something			0
' @entity2 ' : @entity1 gives you five reasons not to miss the finale i think that 's what the public wants			1
[ @entity65 ] " that 's what the public wants ! " that 's really the point of our whole conversation — the fact that people want to see @entity30 and i together			1
who else do you have coming up on the podcast ? we 've got @entity143 , @entity144 ... wait , you 've got @entity144 from @entity145 ? yes			0
i just love the guy			0
that was a great interview			0
he was nothing but witty			0
who else ? i 've got @entity151			0
rumor has it that you will be appearing in the revived @entity85			0
if i 'm not cut out , i will be			0
the @entity159 is back ! @entity160 talks about the sequel , facing @entity162 ( and @entity163 ? ) is that a serious fear ? it 's not a " fear " at all			1
one of the biggest mistakes you can say to somebody is , " oh , i 'm in this movie " or " i 'm on this			0
" there 's a chance always of being cut out			1
did i film some stuff for @entity85 ? yes , i did			0
so if it makes it , all the better			0
you wrote and directed the 2006 comedy @entity179			0
would you like to make another film ? i have directed another movie			0
it 's coming out in may from the good people at @entity184			1
it 's called dealing with @entity186			1
it 's about youth league baseball parents			2
what was the inspiration ? the inspiration was my son playing baseball			0
i was like , i have to write a movie about this			0
is there any news on a new season of @entity2 ? i 'd say it looks good but it wo n't be any time soon			1
because i just finished my movie and [ @entity8 's ] finishing a movie that he did for @entity203 ( the @entity204 - starring @entity202 )			1
so by the time he writes some more and says , " do you want to do them ? " the earliest we 'd start filming , if we did , would be the fall			0
but i think it 's pretty good			2
