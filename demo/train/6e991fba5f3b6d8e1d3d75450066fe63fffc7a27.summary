-- " i do n't want @entity1 to have died in vain			0
" that was the core of the message friday from @entity6 , the brother of the @entity8 journalist @entity7 , beheaded this month by his @entity10 captors			1
@entity6 told @entity3 's @entity11 he hopes @entity13 nations get on the same page when it comes to dealing with kidnappers from militant groups like @entity10 -- saying that having some @entity19 nations pay ransoms while the @entity8 does n't sends an inconsistent message			1
he hopes that communication improves , not just among nations , but between governments and captors			0
he hopes others understand @entity7 ' passion for journalism , to shed light on stories and truths others may never see			2
he hopes people honor him by giving to a @entity35 scholarship fund , go.mu.edu / remember - foley , set up in his honor			0
and @entity6 hopes others can find comfort -- and strength -- like his family has in how his brother acted in his darkest and final moments , as seen in the horrific video of his killing posted online			1
" @entity1 did n't flinch			1
he had the courage , " @entity6 , 38 , said			2
" i 'm certain that he put himself in a position to be first in line ( among the captives to be killed ) , and he wanted us to be strong			1
and that is the message that he was sending , without sending it			0
" even as @entity10 touted the journalist 's killing and threatened others , the world has responded -- in words at least			2
officials and groups from all over have condemned it			0
the latest was the @entity62 , ripping the " heinous and cowardly " execution , which it said illustrates the growing danger facing journalists reporting out of @entity67			1
the @entity8 has n't halted its military campaign against @entity10 forces in @entity70 since the shooting ; in fact , it has threatened to step up efforts in @entity70 and neighboring @entity67 against a group that defense secretary @entity75 described as exhibiting evil " beyond anything we have seen			1
" @entity78 issues chilling warning about @entity10 the @entity6 family has seen it			2
their nightmare started with @entity7 ' november 22 , 2012 , disappearance in northwest @entity67 , near the border with @entity86			2
it got worse when they got an e-mail from his captors a week ago threatening his death -- a message @entity93 , the ceo of the online publication @entity95 , which hired @entity6 as a freelancer -- described as " vitriolic and filled with rage against the @entity8			1
" the nightmare ended with the video , posted tuesday to @entity100 , which also showed another @entity8 journalist , identified as @entity102 , and an @entity10 warning of more dead captives if the @entity8 continues its military operations			1
it 's hard for the @entity107 , still , to put into words what 's happened to this fun - loving uncle , this 40 - year - old who found his dream job as a journalist late in life and embraced it to the core , right up to his death			2
" horror is a good word , " @entity7 said			0
" it 's right out of a @entity120 movie			0
" and unfortunately , you 're in it			0
" brother : @entity10 is evil , but airstrikes may not be enough could @entity7 's story have had a different ending ? his brother thinks so ; in fact , he says he knows " that there 's more that could have been done			1
" " ( @entity8 officials ) hands are tied , in many ways , by the rigid policies that we tend to follow , " @entity6 added			1
@entity93 told the @entity136 that the captors originally demanded a ransom sum of 100 million euros , or about $ 132.5 million , from @entity7 's family and @entity95			2
@entity6 noted that several @entity19 journalists have been freed , after their captors got paid ransoms -- something @entity144 refuses to do , saying it wo n't negotiate with terrorists			1
@entity6 says he understands both stances , stressing instead that consistency is key			2
expecting a militant to free an @entity8 for nothing while freeing a @entity19 for cash does n't make sense			1
" i do n't have all the answers , but i do think that a more cooperative approach ( is needed ) , " he said			0
" and there was n't sharing of information			0
you would n't believe how difficult it was to get information ( on ) released journalists ... from the ways that we have these walls built			0
" @entity8 special operations units were sent into @entity67 this summer to rescue @entity6 and other hostages held by @entity169 militants , a @entity8 official told @entity3			1
several dozen of the most elite @entity8 commandos from units like @entity173 and @entity174 flew in aboard helicopters but could n't find the hostages , including @entity6			1
@entity177 , a deputy national security adviser on friday said the administration was looking at options beyond the current airstrikes in @entity70 against the @entity182 extremists			0
" if we see plotting against @entity8 , see a threat to the @entity8 emanating from anywhere , we stand ready to take action against that threat , " @entity177 told reporters			0
" ... we 're actively considering what 's going to be necessary to deal with that threat , and we 're not going to be restricted by borders			0
" up until last month , the @entity6 family thought they had " made a lot of progress " toward @entity7 ' release			1
but when the @entity8 began hitting @entity10 in @entity70 , the @entity6 family knew it would n't help -- even though , as @entity6 acknowledges , what happened to his brother underscores the evil nature of this group			1
" i think there 's a lot of utility to what 's being done there , " he added			0
" it 's just horrible what @entity10 is doing to the citizens over there and something needs to be done			0
i 'm just not sure that containment and some of these strikes are enough			0
" @entity3 's @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .			0
