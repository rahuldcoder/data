-- it 's amazing what a little spring cleaning can turn up			0
fourth - grade teacher @entity4 was in for quite a shock when she stumbled upon a document dating back to 1792 while emptying out an old classroom at the school where she teaches in @entity10 , @entity11			1
she found the document , apparently a receipt for payment of a debt , buried among some old textbooks and papers			1
" i looked at it , and i saw it was in plastic , which kind of told me there was a chance it was real , " said @entity18 in an interview with @entity0			0
@entity18 says she shared the document with her social studies classes , and her students urged her to find out if it was real			1
she brought it to the @entity32 , which was able to authenticate the 218 - year - old find			1
it turns out the document originally belonged to @entity36 , a @entity37 man who had served in the @entity38 during the @entity39			1
the paper appears to convey that @entity36 had paid off a debt , according to @entity42 , a librarian with the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity37			1
" what 's fascinating is that this turned up in a school classroom so far from @entity37 , " said @entity42			1
how that happened is uncertain			0
@entity18 says the school building where she found it only dates back to the 1930s			1
however , she does have a theory			0
" the only thing i can think of is that a teacher who was there before me or a student brought it in to show			2
then it was put up onto a shelf and forgotten about , " said @entity18			0
the document reveals little else about @entity36 beyond his military service and his debt payment , according to @entity42			2
he says records show @entity36 was born in @entity67 , @entity37 , and died in 1808 at the age of 63			1
@entity36 ' gravestone was recorded during a @entity71 inventory in the 1930s and in burial records in @entity67			2
but @entity42 says people who have gone to the cemetery looking for the grave in the past week were not able to find it -- possibly because a lot of the gravestones in the cemetery are damaged or have deteriorated over a period of time			2
you might think a document like this would be worth a pretty penny			0
but @entity18 says she does n't plan to test the market			0
" if i hold on to it i 'll show it to my grade next year			0
or , we 'll give it to the historical society			0
to find something of that kind of historical value is really important , " she said .			0
