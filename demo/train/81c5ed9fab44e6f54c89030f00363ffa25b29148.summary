you wonder what a visitor from outer space -- or a visitor from the future -- would make of it			2
it 's a scene we take for granted -- six days a week , it has been a routine part of life in every city , town and village in the @entity13			2
a man or a woman , carrying a satchel , walks from house to house , from apartment building to apartment building			0
no one has summoned the person with the satchel ; he or she is expected to show up each day without being asked			0
it 's the postal carrier			0
and because the presence of the postal carrier has for so long been such a familiar sight , perhaps only that visitor from outer space or from the future would be startled by what he was observing : the sight of other people also outdoors , all over town , communicating instantly with each other at the touch of a button , smiling and looking down at the little screens in their palms -- grinning at the through - the - air responses they 're receiving from friends , tapping at the screens to reply anew			0
words flying from person to person , nonstop , on the go			0
as , meanwhile , on those same sidewalks , the men and women with the satchels weave their way through the people with the screens , on their appointed rounds to deliver words by hand			0
the visitor from space , or from a future century , might think this scene -- mailbag luggers walking amid screen tappers -- is like witnessing ox carts amid hovercraft			0
as might an efficiency expert , or a business consultant			0
which summarizes the continuing headache faced by officials in charge of the @entity69			1
the price of a first - class stamp is going up again in the new year : on january 26 , it will increase by three cents , to 49 cents per letter			1
federal regulators last week approved the rise on an allegedly temporary basis -- the higher rate is supposed to last for no more than two years -- but no one really expects it to go back down			0
the @entity69 reports that it lost $ 5 billion in the last fiscal year -- and this is being presented as good news			1
the year before , it lost almost $ 16 billion			0
but there are fewer and fewer envelopes in those satchels , so each stamp will come with a higher price tag ; the billions of dollars the @entity69 is required to pay each year to pre-fund health care for future retirees is a burden heavier than anything that would fit into a mail sack			1
yet there are reasons to hope that the @entity69 finds a way to stay around for a very long time			1
the @entity69 , like @entity95 , @entity96 and other private delivery companies , is a stand - alone business			1
it is expected to sustain itself ; it does not depend on tax money			0
but , unlike @entity95 and @entity96 , the @entity69 must go to @entity100 to get explicit approval for the rates it charges , and for many of the rules under which it operates			1
this is why it costs the same amount to send a letter across the country as it does to send a letter to the next town			1
this is why mail service is universal -- why those carriers are required to show up each day at virtually every address in the @entity13			0
forty - nine cents may seem like a lot to mail a first - class letter			1
but if the @entity69 were to collapse under financial pressures and competition from digital means of communication -- if the @entity69 had to throw in the towel -- do you really think that @entity95 or @entity96 or some other courier service would take your envelope across the country for 49 cents ? over the @entity126 holiday , the failures by @entity95 and @entity96 to get packages to some customers on time were prominent in the news			1
as efficient as @entity95 and @entity96 usually are , the existence and ubiquity of the @entity69 has a lot to do with what keeps them on their toes			1
their business model is : we cost more than the @entity69 , but because of that you can count on us to be reliable and accountable to you			1
if the @entity69 were to go away -- if that check on the other carriers , that extra impetus for them to excel , were to be removed -- what would the impact be on customers and businesses ? could or would the other carriers pick up the slack , at a price that did n't dismay people ? one hopeful sign for the @entity69 has come from an unlikely source : @entity156 , the founder of @entity157			1
@entity157 has announced that it will be delivering its packages on sundays -- and that to deliver those packages it has arranged to use employees of the @entity69			1
the @entity69 has said that it is glad to have the business			2
it without question can use the revenue			0
can daily delivery of mail continue forever in a digital world ? it 's difficult to imagine how			0
in @entity170 , the postal service has informed citizens that , over the next five years , it will stop all door - to - door delivery of letters and concentrate on delivering packages			2
most @entity170 are already asked to pick up letters at community mailbox clusters in neighborhoods or apartment buildings ; soon , everyone will			2
@entity181 , inexpensive mail delivery in the @entity13 has been one of the miracles of the nation 's long story ; if someone were assigned to build a system like it from scratch today -- carriers reporting to every @entity13 address , six days a week , to drop off mail and see if there is any mail to go out , all for pocket change -- that person would have to concede : it ca n't be done			2
but it was done , and , for now , it 's still here			0
for those who , in the digital era , casually say that they 'd be just as happy if the @entity69 were to simply disappear : be careful what you wish for .			2

@entity208 : delivering letters seems from another time in age of text *messages* , *e-mails*
@entity69 needs to raise the cost of a stamp because of *declining* income
@entity208 : yet , what private company would take a letter across country for 49 cents ?
@entity208 : if @entity69 did n't exist , what would effect be on @entity95 , @entity96 ?
