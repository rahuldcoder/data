@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 was abuzz friday with political rumor and intrigue about the possibility of a looming clash between elected leaders and the military after prime minister @entity9 said he believed plots were under way to topple the government			1
" government , @entity19 on collision course , " read the headline of the main story on the website of @entity17 , a leading @entity18 - language newspaper in @entity1			2
" @entity9 takes army head on , " said the top article on the website of @entity23 , another major daily			1
the papers appeared to be interpreting @entity9 's comments thursday , in which he said there were " conspiracies and intrigues being hatched to pack up the elected government , " as an implicit attack on @entity1 's powerful military , which has seized power from civilian authorities a number of times in the country 's history			1
@entity9 said thursday that no institution " can be a state within a state " and that " every ministry , including the @entity44 , is answerable to the @entity45			2
" the @entity1 military denied @entity9 's claims friday , issuing a statement saying the " @entity19 has and will continue to support democratic process in the country			1
" gen. @entity58 , chief of army staff , " dispelled the speculations of any military takeover and said that these are misleading and are being used as a bogey to divert the focus from the real issues , " the military statement said			0
@entity9 's provocative statements come amid a turbulent period in @entity1 's domestic politics and in its relations with the @entity63			1
there is widespread controversy in @entity1 over a scandal -- dubbed " @entity67 " -- in which @entity1 's civilian leaders were supposedly coming up with a plan to unseat the country 's military leadership			1
the killing of @entity73 by @entity74 in may during a raid on a compound located only about a mile from the @entity77 in @entity78 enraged the @entity1 public and deeply embarrassed the military			0
relations became even more strained in november , after @entity83 forces killed two dozen @entity1 soldiers in airstrikes near the @entity87 border -- an attack the @entity63 insists was an act of self - defense after troops were fired upon			0
amid heavy domestic pressure in @entity1 , president @entity93 's government made decisions unpopular with the @entity63 , such as stopping the transport of @entity83 supplies through @entity1 and asking the @entity63 military to vacate the @entity100 air base			1
the @entity67 scandal has emboldened @entity93 's opponents , who think he favors closer ties with the @entity63 military			2
@entity104 , the former @entity1 ambassador to the @entity63 who resigned in november , is accused of writing a memo setting out the scheme			0
the plot reportedly called for taking power away from the country 's senior military and intelligence leaders , requesting @entity63 assistance in stopping a military coup , asking for @entity63 backing of the @entity93 government , and vowing to make @entity1 's foreign policy favorable to the @entity63			1
@entity104 says he did n't write the memo , which allegedly was passed along to @entity63 officials by @entity1 - @entity63 businessman @entity118 days after a @entity63 military raid killed @entity73 in may			2

complicating matters further , @entity93 traveled to @entity128 for medical reasons earlier this month , fueling speculation in @entity1 that the embattled leader may resign			0
@entity93 has since returned to @entity1			0
