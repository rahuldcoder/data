a military standoff with terrorists at a @entity3 mall was apparently drawing to a close tuesday after four days of carnage left at least 61 civilians and six security officers dead			1
five terrorists were killed , and 11 other suspects are in custody , @entity3 's president said			1
about 175 people were injured , he said			0
as authorities indicated the siege was all but over , many questions will have to be answered , such as did the terrorists include @entity16 , a @entity18 subject and a @entity20 national , as claimed by @entity21 , the @entity23 extremists who took responsibility for the gun attack			1
attackers defeated , @entity3 's president says for now , @entity3 reels from a horrific terror attack at @entity29 's upscale @entity28 -- frequented by well - to - do @entity3 and the expatriate community -- which began just after high noon saturday			1
day one : saturday it was a nice day at the 80 - store mall			1
a cooking competition was held for youths , perhaps some aspiring to become chefs			2
visitors stocked up on staples at a supermarket or sipped coffee at a cafe			0
without warning , gunmen stormed the mall , shooting people outside the five - story structure and then inside it			1
shoppers said they also heard grenades exploding			0
other witnesses described it " like a @entity53 - action scene , " said hospital volunteer @entity54			2
mall customers crawled beneath cars in the parking lot and found cover in stairwells and a women 's bathroom , presumably because the gunmen would be reluctant to look in that gender 's restrooms			1
' westgate bad , blood ... i ran , ran , ran ' attackers went from store to store , taking hostages or randomly firing upon people			2
gunmen asked customers whether they were @entity73			2
the terrorists apparently allowed people of that faith to escape from the mall			1
the chaos included an unclear report on deaths			0
finally , by day 's end , 39 people were counted as killed -- a number that would grow			1
several hours into the terror assault , an @entity86 offshoot in neighboring @entity87 called @entity21 used its @entity89 account to claim responsibility			0
authorities now learned who they were dealing with , and the international community condemned the terror , including the @entity3 president whose nephew and his fianc√©e were among those killed			1
day two : sunday the terrorists continued their siege of the mall , and confusion prevailed over the number of deaths and hostages			1
security forces decided to launch a " major assault " on the mall , police said			2
as another violent day unfolded , " most of the hostages " were rescued , and security forces took control of " most parts " of the mall , the @entity3 military said			1
between the bullets are moments of silence			0
authorities numbered the gunmen involved in the attack : 10 to 15 attackers			2
further , unconfirmed reports emerged on who they could be : as many as three are from the @entity16 , two are from @entity87 and one each from @entity20 , @entity130 , @entity3 and the @entity18			1
that information came from sources within @entity21 who spoke to @entity133 about nine names published on @entity89 who were purported to be the alleged hostage - takers			1
@entity137 : @entity21 's @entity16 allies @entity133 could n't independently confirm that claim by @entity21			0
" all efforts are underway to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion , " the @entity3 military said			1
day three : monday the first announcement about deaths on the other side of the siege is made : three terrorists have been killed , authorities said			1
so far , more than 200 civilians have been rescued , they added			0
but 11 @entity3 soldiers have been wounded , the military said			1
@entity3 officials reassured the world that they were in control of the mall			1
the terrorists have little chance of escape , authorities said			0
but sporadic gunfire sent aid workers and journalists running for cover			0
inside the mall , the terrorists ignited a fire , spewing heavy smoke throughout the afternoon			2
" we 're not here to feed the attackers with pastries but to finish and punish them , " @entity3 police inspector general @entity173 warned on @entity89			2
even away from the mall , the country faced intensified security			0
at various locations , more than 10 people were taken into custody for questioning about the attack , including at least four people from an airport			0
opinion : what does attack mean for @entity3 security ? authorities released a few details about the death toll : most of the dead were apparently @entity3 , but the slain included six @entity18 citizens , two @entity196 nationals , two @entity197 and two @entity20 , including a diplomat , their governments said			2
among the 175 people wounded were five @entity16 , the @entity199 said			0
in response to the unconfirmed claim that the terrorists included @entity16 , @entity16 authorities reviewed intelligence reports for evidence of a @entity16 connection to the attack , law enforcement sources said			0
but a senior @entity16 official said the claim was n't looking too solid			0
final day ? tuesday as the world anxiously awaited a conclusion to the terrorists ' siege of the mall , president @entity212 announced forces killed five terrorists at the mall and arrested 11 others for possible ties to the attack			1
" we have ashamed and defeated our attackers , " the president said			0
that announcement , however , did n't answer important questions : were there foreign nationals among the terrorists , what happened to the hostages and what 's the status of the 65 people that the @entity237 says are unaccounted for ? identification of some victims provided glimpses into the terrorists ' alleged barbarity : a pregnant @entity244 woman expecting her first child in october was killed , along with her husband architect who was building hospitals and clinics for free			2
another woman , who was seven months pregnant , was slain			0
a boy , age 8 , was dead , along with his father			0
the material condition of the besieged mall evoked a war scene : three floors of the mall collapsed during the government 's counter-offensive against the terrorists , trapping bodies inside , the president said			1
those trapped bodied include terrorists , @entity212 said			0
" our attackers wish to destroy the essential character of our society			0
they failed , " @entity212 said			0

@entity3 's president indicates terrorists ' siege of @entity29 mall has ended
the gunfire , carnage , hostage - taking lasts four days
a nice day with a kids ' cooking contest becomes *nightmarish* as gunmen storm upscale mall
the complex now evokes war *imagery* , with three collapsed floors trapping bodies
