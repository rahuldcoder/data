-- this year , maybe you think you got everything you ever wanted for @entity3 ( so long as everything you ever wanted was socks and underwear )			2
you did n't get everything you ever wanted			2
because there 's one thing you probably did n't even know existed until right now			1
thus you did n't get it			2
of course , i 'm talking about a life - size lobster case for your @entity12			1
the @entity13 is another completely unnecessary electronics accessory that recently started trending online because , clearly , we love our technology , but , at the same time , simply ca n't leave well enough alone			1
" excuse me , sir , do you sell leather bondage cuffs for @entity19 ? " ok , some of us get freakier than others			2
you see , these days it is n't enough to just bask in the original design beauty of your device			2
never mind that entire teams of smart , creative individuals got together and made a sleek , shiny phone into one of the sexiest things on the planet			2
your job , as a consumer , is to cover it with something lumpy			2
my friend @entity39 's head , for example			1
but you have to accessorize			2
it 's about protecting your investment , and , really , if you 're going to do that , you might as well give it some personality			1
you see , the lobster case was n't actually designed to be functional			1
quite the opposite , in fact			0
this thing is art. the creator of the lobster case is an @entity57 named @entity56 who , with his design company @entity58 , specializes in contemporary furniture and lighting			1
how this particular product fits into his business model i do n't know , but i think we 're all better people because of it			0
then again , i say that about everything			0
" did you hear @entity68 has syphilis ? " " well , we 're all better people because of it			0
" regardless , @entity56 says of his art , " the phone case is a commentary on both the curious nature of the mobile phone case industry and of the modern dependency and / or addiction to mobile technology			1
" to be fair , i liked it better when it was just a lobster case			1
but all right , i can accept that there 's more to it			1
i get art. i 'm cultured			0
i 've been known to wear pants occasionally			0
but what @entity56 wants us to take away is that we need to detach from our mobile technology			1
so the lobster is meant to be very user - unfriendly as a personal deterrent , resulting , as he says , in " minimal enjoyment of function , zero fashion credibility and lastly , reduced mobility to the user			0
" clearly , however , it seems @entity56 is unfamiliar with the great @entity99 hipster , for it is those very reasons that make the lobster case desirable			1
though even if you are n't of the hipster species , it 's still a pretty cool - looking phone accessory			1
that 's when you realize that you have a lobster in your pants			1
but an hour is more than enough time to feel special			0
which is sort of the point			0
to this , @entity56 notes , " like most mobile phone cases , it does offer the illusion of individualism			0
" his creation was actually inspired by arguably one of the weirdest ( and most brilliant ) people ever , @entity123 , who , in 1936 , designed a fully functioning @entity124			0
not merely just an @entity12 case			1
though that would 've been impressive			0
" i promise in seventy years this will be relevant			0
" at the time , @entity123 called his creation of a painted plaster lobster attached to the receiver the @entity124 , presumably just to mess with people			0
because , generally speaking , crustaceans do n't inspire lust			0
at least to most people			0
for me , it 's sort of " a thing			1
" anyway , whether or not you would walk around with @entity56 's modern version of @entity123 's lobster phone is a moot point			1
according to @entity144 , right now it 's only a design concept and not currently on the market			1
so you 're stuck with whatever stupid , boring case you bought at the @entity149			2
and , really , we 're all better people because of it			0
he still has syphilis .			0

" @entity157 " is @entity155 's *weekly* , *offbeat* look at items trending online
this week , @entity160 cracks open the @entity13
the case is a *statement* about modern dependency on technology , @entity160 says
it will also probably make hipsters very happy , he says
