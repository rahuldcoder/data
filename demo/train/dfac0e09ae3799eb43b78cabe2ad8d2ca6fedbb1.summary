@entity0 -- it has often been said that the @entity3 is the most ambitious conflict management project ever undertaken			1
over the past sixty years , it has certainly transformed the ways in which the peoples and countries of @entity9 work with one another			0
for example , the idea that force -- or even the threat of force -- could ever be used as a means of dealing with problems is simply unthinkable			0
it is this change in the very way that @entity19 think about each other that has been recognized by the @entity22			0
@entity23 is slap on the back for a struggling @entity3 however , looking beyond the example of @entity28 - @entity27 reconciliation , and the reunification of @entity30 and @entity9 after the end of the @entity32 , many wonder whether the @entity3 has managed to bring about as much peace and stability as is generally supposed			1
in some cases , the verdict is clearly positive			0
in @entity39 , for example , the @entity3 has certainly helped to lessen tensions and create a more peaceful situation			1
although fundamental differences remain over sovereignty , the @entity3 has played an instrumental role in creating conditions whereby the day to day elements of territorial division are less important than ever before			1
meanwhile , over in the @entity48 , the @entity3 played a key role -- albeit indirectly -- in creating the conditions for a rapprochement between @entity52 and @entity53 ; a process that still continues even though @entity53 membership now appears distant			1
this too is an important success			0
elsewhere , though , the picture is rather less positive			0
in the case of @entity59 , the @entity3 certainly provided the impetus for conflict resolution			1
by announcing its commitment to admit a divided @entity59 , the @entity3 forced @entity53 and the then @entity53 @entity59 leadership to adopt a more constructive approach to reunification talks than had previously been the case			1
the problem was that the @entity3 failed to create safeguards to ensure that the @entity69 would also play ball			2
this has come to be been seen by many as a major failing			1
@entity59 is still unresolved after almost a decade of @entity3 membership			1
but it is in the @entity76 that the award has been greeted with the greatest degree of skepticism			1
from the moment the news first broke , people from the region have responded with incredulity			2
many have pointed out the negative role played the @entity3 in the region in the 1990s			2
by failing to take a united position at the very earliest stages of the crisis , the @entity3 is widely seen to have contributed to the bloody events that followed			1
at the same time , its failure to respond more decisively to the conflict once it had broken out is seen by many to have cost tens of thousands of lives			0
meanwhile , looking to the present , the @entity3 is still felt by many on the region to be falling short well short of its lofty ideals			2
although @entity3 officials insist that the @entity3 is still keen to enlarge , and will eventually include the countries of the @entity76 , in reality many believe that it is not committed to doing so			1
this is now feeding renewed fears of instability			0
reconciliation and cooperation has , for better or for worse , been driven by a sense that the region is moving towards the @entity3 membership			2
without that perspective , there are fears that the countries may slide back into nationalism			0
looked at from the perspective of most of the continent , the award is richly deserved			0
countries with a long history of conflict now live together in peace			2
however , in one corner of @entity9 , there are many who are less willing to cheer the decision of the committee			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity128 - @entity127			0

the @entity3 is often seen as most ambitious conflict management project ever undertaken
but @entity133 questions whether it has brought about as much peace as people think
he points to the still unresolved situation in @entity59 as a major failing
however , it is in the @entity76 that the prize has been greeted with most skepticism he says
