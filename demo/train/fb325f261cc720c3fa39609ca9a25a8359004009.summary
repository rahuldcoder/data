@entity0 , @entity1 -- the economy in southern @entity1 is not by any means among the worst in the nation			0
still , according to city records , there are 29 foreclosed homes on the books in @entity0 -- many of which are in deplorable condition			1
@entity13 had been ripped open in this foreclosed home in @entity15 , @entity16			2
" this house is not livable right now , " @entity17 , the city 's chief building code inspector , told @entity2 as he stood in front of a boarded - up single - family home on a residential street in @entity0			2
the foundation of the house was fractured , @entity17 said , and there were cracks and fissures in many of the supporting beams			0
at the side entrance to the house were broken windows , garbage and peeling paint			0
in 2006 , @entity17 said , the property sold for $ 200,000			2
it 's anyone 's guess , he said , what price the home might bring now , if it ever sold			2
that this foreclosed home might not ever sell was not news to a researcher who lives nearby			1
" about a third of all of the foreclosed properties nationwide have been so damaged , either by the previous owners or by criminal gangs coming in after the foreclosure , that they no longer qualify for standard mortgage financing , " @entity43 told @entity2			1
" so there is going to be all kinds of government programs to help , but if they do n't qualify for standard mortgage financing , there 's no one to buy these properties			1
" @entity43 says responses from thousands of real estate agents nationwide to the questionnaires he sends out quarterly indicate that badly damaged foreclosed homes -- so - called " distressed " properties in real estate jargon -- are a much bigger element of the national housing picture than officials in @entity69 have acknowledged			1
@entity43 's work is under the auspices of @entity72 , a @entity69 - based group that supplies data to private mortgage industry analysts			2
" in many cases , it costs so much to rehabilitate these houses , it 's just not cost - effective , " he told @entity2			1
" and the properties are eventually going to be bulldozed			1
" in some cities hit harder by the national economic downturn , a quick glance at foreclosed homes paints an even harsher picture			1
" a lot of these homes have been vandalized , " @entity83 , an @entity15 , @entity16 , real estate broker , told @entity2			2
she was speaking in front of several foreclosed , boarded - up houses not far from the city 's center			1
" they are a little scary going into them , " she said			0
" the power is out , a lot of them are boarded up			0
" a @entity2 camera crew was allowed into several of the houses			0
trash was everywhere ; plaster walls had been ripped open to expose wiring ; and in one case a toilet was dumped on an empty living room floor			0
the banks that own the properties , @entity103 told @entity2 , probably will not simply walk away from the homes			0
" usually abandoning homes means it has n't sold , " she explained			1
" they will eventually sell			0
it will be pennies at best on the dollar , but they will eventually sell			0
" from his office in @entity1 , @entity43 said he is not at all certain of that			0
" there are some cases where the properties have been so damaged that it 's not profitable for the mortgage investor , which is a bank , to take title to the property , " he said			0
the @entity124 told @entity2 it found no hard evidence of such a trend			1
some of the information , a spokesman said , was " anecdotal , " but there was no data one way or the other yet collected			0
a spokesman for the @entity133 in @entity69 told @entity2 that unsalable homes are still a relatively small part of the national inventory of foreclosed properties			2
but , the spokesman added , the worse the economy is in a particular region , the more damaged and vandalized foreclosed homes are likely to be .			1

many foreclosed homes are so damaged , they probably wo n't be sold , some say
researcher : one - third of foreclosed homes too damaged for standard financing
many of the houses are " eventually going to be bulldozed , " researcher says
@entity124 says it has no hard evidence of such a trend
