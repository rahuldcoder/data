-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 all have one thing in common : it 's not just that they were unarmed men of color killed by police officers -- it 's that the responsibility to investigate each of their deaths fell to a medical examiner			1
we medical examiners investigate all homicides and violent deaths , and it is also part of our legal duty to investigate any death of a person under the control of , or in the custody of , a law enforcement agent			1
i have worked as a medical examiner for 13 years in four large cities in the @entity29			2
medical examiner offices are independent public agencies , and one of our responsibilities is to act as quality control over law enforcement agencies			1
the medical examiner is the final arbiter of whether a death was the direct result of an arrest , or , instead , the result of natural disease or an incidental event			2
medical examiner reports in most states are public records			1
we all deserve and should expect transparency in death investigation			0
the family of the deceased , the news media and anyone who asks for it can get a copy of the medical examiner 's or coroner 's autopsy report on any case that is not sealed as part of an active investigation			1
medical examiners are physicians , specialists in forensic pathology			1
we are professionally protective of our independence			0
we know that it is our duty and responsibility , as the doctors who perform the autopsy , to speak for the dead			1
unfortunately , in the wake of the death of a civilian at the hand of police officers , the public is often suspicious of the medical examiner			1
because the law requires a local government agency to perform the death investigation , people often assume that this agency falls under the jurisdiction or influence of the police			1
news reports critical of the amount of time the dead body was left at the scene , or the amount of time it takes to get a final autopsy report , exacerbate this distrust			1
in @entity97 , @entity98 , where @entity1 was autopsied , dr. @entity96 , the chief medical examiner , is a board - certified forensic pathologist			1
she has years of experience and reports to the @entity101 , not the police			0
@entity1 's official autopsy report was expedited and finalized on monday			1
it was made available to the prosecuting attorney , who is now in charge of any release of information			0
why does a death scene investigation take so long ? an outdoor death scene is a messy and complicated place			0
as soon as the person has been declared dead , the area has to be frozen in time to ensure that we , the public , can later learn what really happened there			1
crime scene photographers and trained evidence collection analysts have to " process the scene , " an hourslong procedure when done properly			0
the body , the position of any vehicles , the lighting , the height of adjacent structures -- everything needs to be photographed from multiple angles			2
in a shooting , crime scene investigators will have to measure and document the number and location of the casings , bullets and strike marks			0
if the evidence and its undisturbed location are not documented in this painstaking way , then criminal or civil complaints against the officer may not stand up in court			2
but what about the autopsy report ? why does that take so long ? that 's because a competent job in the morgue , too , takes time			1
the work i do as a doctor in the autopsy suite after a typical gunshot wound homicide case may take three or four hours to complete , but after i leave the morgue , the report is not done			1
i have to wait for the report from the toxicology lab , which usually takes a minimum of two weeks , and for histology slides to come back before i can examine them under a microscope			2
any of these findings could impact the cause of death			0
even gunshot wounds can not be interpreted in a vacuum			0
as part of an investigation i have to try to figure out which defects in the body come from bullets entering , and which from their exit			2
usually these wounds are distinctly different in appearance , but the more complex the body position of the deceased , the more complicated things get			2
exit wounds in flesh pressed against the ground or against tight clothing can appear just like entrance wounds			0
an entrance wound inflicted through an intermediary target that deformed the bullet can look just like an exit wound			0
sometimes i have to wait for the police reports or witness transcripts in to correctly interpret what i see on the body in the autopsy suite			1
after the shooting in @entity197 , @entity1 's family hired dr. @entity198 , a former @entity199 medical examiner , to conduct a second autopsy , and the federal @entity201 instructed the @entity202 to conduct a third			1
what you can tell from a second or third autopsy is limited by autopsy artifact -- changes to the evidence caused by the performance of the first autopsy			2
in the course of the first , legally mandated autopsy , the forensic pathologist will have taken the organs out and sliced them apart for examination			2
the gunshot wounds will have been probed , and sometimes even cut into			0
more importantly , any pathologist hired by the family , regardless of expertise , does not have access to the crime scene and other evidence			0
even @entity198 , in the report he prepared for the @entity1 family , concluded that without the clothing , evidence or scene information , he had " too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting			1
" why were n't the @entity233 medical examiner 's autopsy findings made public immediately ? because releasing preliminary information when the investigation is still ongoing is premature and potentially inflammatory			1
already the results of @entity198 's limited investigation are being used to support the contention that @entity1 was surrendering , and that the wounds were distant range , even though @entity198 himself said neither			1
to a forensic pathologist , the body diagram @entity1 's attorneys released tells a different story			1
the wound at the top of the head , the frontal wounds and angled right hand and arm wounds suggest that the victim was facing the officer , leaning forward with his right arm possibly extended in line with the gun 's barrel , and not above his head			1
the image of a person standing upright with his hands in the air when he was shot does not appear compatible with the wounds documented on that diagram			2
whether a forward - leaning position is a posture of attack or of surrender , however , is a matter of perspective			1
from the perspective of a witness , it could appear that the leaning person is complying with the officer and getting down			1
from the perspective of the officer , he may appear to be coming at him			0
partial evidence yields partial answers , and a rush to conclusions based on one isolated set of data from a second autopsy only raises more questions			0
that is why it is so important to be patient and wait for all the scene information to come to light			0
but " be patient and wait " is not a demand that anyone has the right to make on a family that has lost a loved one in a sudden and violent event			0
when i have been assigned to investigate an in - custody or officer - involved death , i will often call the family right away			0
it 's important to me to reach out to them , to tell the people who are awaiting answers from me that i am qualified to do the job i am trained for ; that i will hide nothing from them ; that everything i do on their behalf will be part of the public record ; and to give them some idea of how long the process might take			0
when the report is finished , i meet with family members or their attorneys to discuss the findings and explain the medical diagnoses i have come to			2
this solemn conference takes place behind the scenes , months after the incident , and is never reported in the news media -- but it is probably the most important part of my job			0
as a doctor and a civil servant , i take my public role seriously			0
i strive to with all my ability , training and effort to answer any questions that person 's family may have			0
i know that others in my field strive with the same effort			0
it 's why we went into our field of medicine			0
we are servants of the public -- not of the state , not of any single law firm , and not of the police			2
magazine : the aftermath in @entity197			0

@entity349 : medical examiners act as quality control over law enforcement agencies
@entity349 : body diagram of @entity1 suggests he was facing the officer , leaning forward
she says as doctors who perform the autopsy , medical examiners speak for the dead
@entity349 : public should trust medical examiners ' report since they act independent
