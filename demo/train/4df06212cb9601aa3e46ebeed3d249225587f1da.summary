editor 's note : @entity2 is host of the @entity4 show , " issues with @entity2 , " a topical event - driven show with a wide range of viewpoints			1
@entity2 is the author of " secrets can be murder : what @entity12 's @entity11			2
" @entity2 says the @entity16 - @entity15 relationship sends a bad message to young people			1
@entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- pop star @entity16 has been charged with two felonies -- including assault -- in the @entity15 beating case			1
if convicted , @entity16 could face more than four years behind bars			2
the charges stem from the early morning of february 8 , when he and his girlfriend @entity15 reportedly got into a heated argument in his car hours before they were scheduled to appear at the @entity29 's			1
what police say happened next shook the entertainment world			0
a @entity34 affidavit says @entity16 gave @entity15 a vicious and continuous beating			1
he allegedly started by shoving @entity15 's head against the passenger window , then punched her in the face numerous times while still driving			2
the beating reportedly splattered blood on @entity15 's clothing and the car interior			1
the report goes on to say that in between barrages of punches , @entity16 placed @entity15 in a headlock and bit her ear -- still driving , mind you			1
after stopping the car , @entity15 says @entity16 again put her in a headlock			1
she said she began losing consciousness and as she fought back , he bit her finger			0
days later , a gruesome police photo of @entity15 leaked to the media and it showed her with a bruised , scratched face and a split lip			2
it was clear evidence of a continuous pummeling , not some impassioned slap in the heat of the moment			0
perhaps even more shocking than these grisly details are reports that this may not have been @entity16 's first time abusing @entity15			1
according to @entity68 , @entity15 told the @entity69 that @entity16 had attacked her several times in the past , and the assaults were gradually becoming more violent			1
yet less than a month after this ordeal , @entity15 has apparently forgiven him			0
amazingly , according to an unidentified source quoted by @entity74 , @entity16 called @entity15 on her 21st birthday and the two then reunited for some time together at @entity76 , @entity77 , mansion			1
through her lawyer , @entity15 asked a judge thursday not to prohibit @entity16 from having contact with her while he faces the felony charges of assaulting her			1
before the reported reconciliation , @entity16 attended anger management classes , according to the @entity85 , even though legally he did n't have to			0
sure , it 's a positive step , but come on , @entity15 ! nobody can change that quickly			0
@entity15 and @entity16 's punch drunk love is sending a dangerous message to their young fans			1
and do n't tell me children are n't paying attention , because they are both up for @entity95 on march 28			0
@entity15 's apparent quick forgiveness for the alleged pummeling sends the worst possible signal -- namely , that this sort of behavior is just par for the course when it comes to male - female relationships			1
when you look at the numbers , it is certainly more prevalent than we 'd like to admit			0
according to a study by the @entity110 , 5.3 million women are abused annually in the @entity12			0
an @entity112 survey found that about one out of four @entity12 women are raped or physically assaulted by a current or former partner at some point in their lifetime			0
but there is some progress			0
the @entity122 's @entity121 found that intimate partner abuse rates in @entity12 have steadily declined since 1993			0
yet the @entity15 beating shows just how much ground we still must cover			2
as much as i sympathize with her , i think @entity15 herself may have to go to classes			0
her reported reunion with @entity16 enables his allegedly abusive behavior and is , in my opinion , a classic case of battered woman 's syndrome			2
if she is going back to @entity16 so soon , @entity15 is putting herself at risk and seems to be falling into the brutal cycle of powerlessness , fear and low self esteem that often accompanies abusive relationships			2
and it sends a message to @entity16 that he does n't have to change			2
ireport.com : @entity16 fans : share your reaction if the reconciliation is real , @entity15 is also setting a dangerous example for other abused women			1
unfortunately , despite her incredible looks and talent , i think she is now the poster child for battered woman 's syndrome			0
our society must stop this cycle of helplessness that traps abused women			0
we must give them the help they need to escape the abusive spiral			0
but women must begin holding their loved ones to a zero - tolerance policy when it comes to violence			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity173 @entity16 facing felony charges for beating
she says his girlfriend @entity15 reportedly has reconciled with @entity16
@entity2 : the case sends worst possible message to young people
she says women must have zero - tolerance policy on *domestic* violence
