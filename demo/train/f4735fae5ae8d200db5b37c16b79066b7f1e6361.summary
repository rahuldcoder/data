after 14 years , the @entity6 , as it has been known since 2013 , is leaving @entity2 ' native @entity7 and heading to the @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity10			1
" @entity11 , the board here , all the volunteers that come out and support us in sunshine or rain , wind , cold or perfect sunny @entity7 days , " the 14 - time major winner told the @entity14 website			1
" they come out to support our event and have made this event as special as it has been			1
most golf tournaments do n't stay at one golf course for that long			0
i foresee certainly an emotional sunday for sure			2
" @entity2 is a five - time winner of the event , which is held as a benefit for the @entity31 , boasts a prize fund of $ 3.5 million -- $ 1 million of which goes to the winner			1
this year 's 18 - man field features illustrious names such as former world no. 1 @entity37 and @entity40 major winners @entity38 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
@entity2 admits it was not easy to get so many world class golfers in one place at the same time at the end of an arduous year			1
" it 's harder to get good players to play , quite frankly , " said the 37 - year - old			1
" and sponsorship dollars are certainly not exactly easy to come by in these economic times			2
so it made sense for us to move			0
" it was certainly not an easy decision			0
but there are a lot of players that are based there in @entity10			2
it will be a little easier for the guys to make a trek out instead of coming all the way out here , to stay right there in @entity10			0
" reflecting on his own season -- which has included five @entity14 titles -- woods bemoaned his inability to capture a major championship			0
" i certainly wish i could have played a little better in major championships , " added @entity2			1
" i was there at the masters and there at the @entity78 certainly with a chance , but just did n't get it done			0
" the other two i just did n't play well			2
but winning @entity82 and then obviously four other events , i think it 's a pretty good year			2
" i feel like i 've improved this year than i did over the previous year			0
i 'm very pleased at the overall year			0
" @entity37 heads into the event off the back of his first win of the year at last week 's @entity87			1
this season has seen the @entity90 slip to sixth in the world rankings and struggle to display his best form having switched to @entity94 clubs at the beginning of 2013			2
at the end of a season when the two - time major winner has failed to challenge for the sport 's most prestigious titles , @entity37 was pleased with his ability to grind out a win despite fierce competition from in - form world no. 2 @entity105			1
" i felt like i saw enough good golf in there to know that it was very close , and it was n't going to be long before i did win , " said the 24 - year - old			0
" what i was happy with the most was the limited amount of times that i have gotten in contention this year , i have played well			0
i have played well down the stretch			0
i 've played well under pressure , and that is something that i really have improved on the last few years			0
