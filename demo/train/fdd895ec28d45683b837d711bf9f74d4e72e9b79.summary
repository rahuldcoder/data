-- as numerous news organizations have reported , @entity1 has sent two planes so that about 100 of its citizens who want to can leave @entity5			1
tellingly , the planes were not sent to @entity7 where the security situation around the airport has reportedly deteriorated , but to @entity10 instead to which the @entity1 departing @entity5 traveled by bus			2
in its characteristic fashion , the @entity1 government has denied that this is an evacuation			1
an unnamed @entity1 diplomat in @entity7 , though , did not rule out the possibility of further flights			0
@entity1 naval exercises in the @entity20 may also be the prelude to a seaborne evacuation from the @entity5 coast			2
these actions are not the first indication that @entity26 expects the @entity28 regime may fall			1
@entity1 deputy foreign minister @entity29 acknowledged this possibility in december , and president @entity31 himself seemed to distance himself from president @entity28 a week later			0
arranging for the emergency departure of @entity1 citizens from @entity5 though , is the most serious indication to date that the @entity35 is preparing for the further weakening or even the downfall of the @entity28 regime			1
read more : the @entity26 - @entity7 alliance , a tangled tale these @entity1 moves , of course , are not ones that the @entity28 regime can be pleased with			1
the top leaders as well as officers in its security services , though , may have a strong incentive to protect the @entity1 exodus in order to secure their own prospects for fleeing to @entity1 in the event that the regime falls			0
after opposing @entity53 calls for @entity28 to leave @entity5 for so long , @entity26 is not going to publicly urge him to do so before it is too late			1
the very fact that @entity26 has begun to organize the departure of its own citizens from @entity5 though , is a signal that @entity28 still has a window of opportunity to depart			1
@entity26 has not yet withdrawn its personnel from the @entity1 embassy in @entity7			0
if and when it does , this will signal that the @entity35 has determined that the regime really is about to fall			0
the departure of @entity1 embassy personnel may also be the last opportunity for @entity28 and his family to leave @entity7 with @entity26 's assistance			2
the downfall of the @entity28 regime will present challenges both for neighboring countries and for all the major powers			0
because of its ties to the @entity28 regime the challenges that @entity26 faces in @entity5 after its downfall will be especially difficult			1
@entity26 will want to keep its naval facilities at the @entity5 port of @entity78 as well as its economic and trade relations with @entity5			0
yet while the @entity81 may be willing to accommodate @entity26 here , it is not clear that a new @entity5 government that is resentful over @entity26 's past support for @entity28 will be			2
if the @entity86 minority that the @entity28 regime is based on manages to flee to its heartland on the @entity5 coast and establish a mini-state there , @entity26 will face some especially difficult choices			1
that rump regime will be eager to allow @entity26 to keep its naval facility at @entity78 and continue receiving @entity1 arms			0
if @entity26 agrees to do this , however , it will not only have hostile relations with the new @entity97 - dominated regime in @entity7 that is likely to arise , but also with @entity97 - led governments throughout the @entity100 world			0
the new @entity97 - dominated government ( or just various @entity97 forces ) may decide to retaliate through attacking @entity1 personnel in the @entity105 conflict that is likely to continue , and perhaps through assisting @entity107 rebels in the @entity109 and @entity1 's other @entity107 regions			0
yet if @entity26 does not back it , this rump @entity86 regime may not last long and the new @entity97 - dominated @entity5 government might expel the @entity1 anyway			1
@entity26 did not have to back the @entity28 regime as much as it has			2
but because it did , @entity1 interests in @entity5 are especially likely to suffer as it continues to crumble			0
most unfortunately , it is the @entity1 citizens now desperately trying to escape from @entity5 who may suffer most from the consequences of @entity26 's poor choices .			2
