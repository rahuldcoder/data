@entity0 , @entity1 -- about 35 @entity4 activists dressed in pink are expected to take part in a demonstration friday in @entity0 against @entity4 drone strikes that target militants in @entity1			1
the @entity4 protesters , from the anti-war group @entity10 , are visiting @entity1 to make contact with people affected by the drone strikes and draw the attention of the @entity4 public to the situation in areas where the attacks take place			1
" we are here to say , on behalf of those @entity4 with a conscience , that we apologize to the people of @entity1 for the killing and suffering " caused by the drones , @entity20 , one of the founders of @entity10 , said at a news conference thursday in @entity0			1
organized in conjunction with a @entity30 advocacy group , the rally friday is scheduled to take place in one of the @entity1 capital 's busiest market places			1
the protesters say they plan to wear bright pink clothes , carry banners and recite anti-drone chants			1
the drone strike program in @entity1 has long been controversial , with conflicting reports on its impact from the @entity4 government , @entity1 officials and independent organizations			1
@entity4 officials insist that the choice and execution of the strikes -- begun under former president @entity49 and ramped up under president @entity50 -- meet strict standards and that cases of civilian deaths or injuries are extremely rare			0
but a study released last month by @entity56 and @entity58 's @entity57 said the drone attacks had killed far more people than the @entity4 acknowledges , traumatized innocent residents and been largely ineffective			2
civilians account for a significant portion of those killed , the study said			0
the drone program is deeply unpopular in @entity1 , where the national parliament voted in april to end any authorization for it			2
@entity10 's demonstration friday in @entity0 is the precursor to a bigger , more ambitious protest over drone strikes in which the group plans to participate over the weekend			2
the activists say they hope to join cricket - star - turned - politician @entity73 and his party , @entity75 , in a march to @entity77 , part of @entity1 's ungoverned tribal region along the @entity81 border where drone strikes are frequent			2
but the activists say they are unsure if the @entity1 government will allow them to take part in the march to the restive region			0
the neighboring district , @entity88 , is widely believed to be the headquarters of the @entity90 -- a militant group @entity92 has long accused of fueling some of the deadliest attacks against @entity95 troops in @entity81			0
if the authorities prevent them from participating in the march to @entity77 , the @entity10 activists say they will invite people from the area affected by the drone strikes to join them in a large gathering in @entity0			2
they say they are also considering the possibility of a hunger strike outside the @entity104 in the capital			0
@entity10 says on its website that the broader goal of its @entity1 trip is to " stop the drone strikes and get compensation for the families of civilians killed by the strikes			1
" it has held meetings in @entity0 this week with victims of the strikes and @entity4 officials			0
the women - led organization became known for antiwar demonstrations in @entity92 during the @entity4 buildup in @entity121			1
the group has held protests over a range of different international issues			0
@entity10 has regularly disrupted high - profile congressional hearings dealing with war and national defense issues , as well as interrupting speeches by foreign officials like prime minister @entity131 of @entity132			0
among the activists with the @entity10 delegation in @entity1 at the moment is @entity136 , a former @entity137 colonel and @entity139 official who quit her post to protest the @entity4 invasion of @entity121			1
in an appearance this week on the @entity1 television station @entity144 , @entity142 said that @entity4 drone strikes are a violation of @entity1 's sovereignty and are fueling anti-american sentiment in the region			1
when the @entity1 television host asked @entity142 to respond to accusations that she was a radical activist , she said jokingly , " i 'm a radical peace activist			0
" @entity2 's @entity152 reported from @entity0 , and @entity153 from @entity154			0
@entity2 's @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
