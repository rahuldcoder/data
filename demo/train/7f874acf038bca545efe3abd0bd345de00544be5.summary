-- although residents often like to joke that it is , the mosquito is n't actually @entity5 's official state bird			1
( that 'd be the willow ptarmigan			0
) you also wo n't see many coconut trees growing in the far north			0
judging by signage along @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity5 , however , you might not necessarily know those things			1
appearing along the steep , winding ascent to the top of @entity23 , road signs depicting giant mosquitoes carrying off human prey and warning of falling coconuts are clearly meant to get a laugh out of drivers			1
