-- the @entity2 talks over @entity4 's nuclear program concluded inconclusively with a decision to continue negotiating in @entity6 next month			1
how could they have ended otherwise ? too much suspicion , mistrust and too many complex issues to imagine an early breakthrough			0
at the same time , the uncertainties reflect something else too			0
let me make a prediction			0
there will be no war with @entity4 in 2012 and no comprehensive deal on the nuclear issue either			1
sanctions have forced the @entity4 to alter the pace of its nuclear program but not to abandon it			1
right now it 's in everyone 's interest to defuse tensions , and to paraphrase @entity27 , to jaw - jaw rather than wah - wah			0
unless @entity4 is prepared to give up its quest for nukes ( and it is n't ) , we 've averted war but not eliminated the threat			1
for the past six months , the relationship between @entity4 and the @entity36 has been defined by covert war and much talk of an overt one			1
for the next six , the trope will be " let 's make a deal			2
" the reasons are n't hard to divine			0
first , sanctions are taking their toll and are on the verge of getting tougher			0
in early july , the @entity47 will impose additional oil sanctions			0
second , the position of @entity51 ayatollah @entity50 has been strengthened as a result of parliamentary elections and mullah maneuvering			0
if he were inclined to show flexibility , the decider - in - chief is in a better position to do it now			0
and third , let 's face it , nobody -- not the @entity4 , the @entity47 , the @entity61 administration , not even the @entity62 , particularly if they have to do it alone -- wants a war			1
all of these factors have combined to create an opening for that almighty and much - revered diplomatic deus ex machina : the process			0
to be kind , that 's just another word for describing how to manage a problem you ca n't resolve today			2
the desire to shift from talk of war to actual talk and negotiations is both logical and understandable			0
in fact , given the limited options right now , a process is much better than the alternative			0
the hope is that negotiations can create an opening for a small deal on the nuclear issue in which @entity4 would agree to enrich uranium at much reduced levels , agree to inspections and perhaps even export its stockpile of weapons - grade material out of the country in return for an easing of some of the less onerous sanctions			1
this incremental approach , tiny steps for tiny feet , would buy time and space to enhance confidence and create trust			0
it might even pave the way for broader discussions on other key issues that divide @entity4 and the @entity36			2
maybe even a grander bargain might follow			0
the only problem with this approach is that its chances of success are dubious			0
in coming weeks and months , the negotiating process may well produce limited understandings			0
but it 's hard to see how these will turn into a sustainable deal that can convince the @entity36 , let alone the @entity62 , that @entity4 has given up its quest for nukes			1
three major realities will make it all the harder : @entity4 wants a nuclear capacity			1
outside of the five permanent members of the @entity128 , four nations possess nukes : @entity62 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			2
all are fundamentally insecure and perceive nukes as a core advantage in their security and foreign policy theology			0
@entity4 is insecure , but it believes it is profoundly entitled			2
this mix of vulnerability and grandiosity is a bad combination			0
the @entity4 regime wants the bomb , not primarily to have the option of attacking @entity62 , a possible fringe benefit , but as a hedge against regime change and as a prestige weapon in its quest for regional power and influence			1
had the @entity152 not been turned out by the 1979 revolution , @entity4 would already have nukes			2
@entity4 fashions itself a great power , and great powers believe they need the ultimate weapon			2
@entity4 's nuclear program is too advanced , too entrenched , too redundant and too secretive to be stopped permanently , even by military attack			1
to do so , you 'd need to change the regime			0
the @entity164 - @entity4 @entity163			1
the nuclear issue needs to be seen in the context of the broader dysfunction in the relationship between @entity169 and @entity170			0
truth is , the regime is right			0
@entity164 wants an end to its repression and brutality , freedom for the @entity4 people and @entity4 's regional ambitions curtailed			1
there 's almost no issue on which @entity169 and @entity170 agree , from support for @entity182 and @entity183 , to backing the @entity184 , to @entity4 terrorism , to support for @entity187 insurgents , to @entity188 and to @entity62 and the @entity189			1
given the level of suspicion and mistrust , the odds of finding a sustainable modus vivendi soon , particularly against the backdrop of the regime change issue , are slim to none			0
as long as the regime is convinced that @entity164 wants it replaced and @entity4 's regional ambitions muzzled , @entity4 will continue its quest for nukes			1
indeed , the nuclear issue ca n't be separated from the issue of regime insecurity			2
it 's emblematic of @entity4 's hopes and fears			1
@entity62 hopes and fears factor centrally into the equation too			2
we would n't have the tough sanctions we do if it were n't for president @entity61 's and the @entity47 ' fear of an @entity62 strike			1
paradoxically , @entity61 fears an @entity62 strike more than the mullahs do			1
on one hand , you might argue that the @entity62 threats have increased the chances of a diplomatic resolution			2
that would be true , but only if @entity4 actually feared an @entity62 attack or if it were n't determined to continue its quest for nukes			1
but the @entity4 regime wo n't stop , and will inch closer to a breakout capacity to produce a weapon			1
and the @entity62 will then have to decide whether to launch a military strike or bring enough pressure on the @entity61 administration to do so , even if it only means a setback of a year or two			2
only one country can stop @entity4 from acquiring a military nuclear capacity -- that 's @entity4 , should it judge the costs of acquisition too high			1
now process , diplomacy and negotiations are king			0
but without some fundamental breakthrough in the talks or some other unpredictable event that changes @entity4 calculations , we 'll be drifting again toward war and the prospective disasters and calamities it will bring			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			2

@entity252 predicts no war with @entity4 in 2012
@entity250 says no firm deal will emerge ; @entity4 wants to be nuclear power too much
@entity250 : the regime distrusts the @entity164 and wo n't give up
@entity62 strike is still possible , he says . only big breakthrough will stop @entity4 's quest
