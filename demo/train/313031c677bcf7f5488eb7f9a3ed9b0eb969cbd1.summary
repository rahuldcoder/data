@entity4 , suspected of stealing automobiles , boats and airplanes , as well as committing a number of other thefts , earned his nickname -- the @entity4 -- by committing some of his crimes without shoes			0

" i wrote when he first started running that he would get a movie deal , " @entity0 commenter @entity43 wrote			2
" they offered him a reward to come in that was nowhere near what the movie people would offer			2
" another @entity0 commenter , @entity54 , wrote : " it 's a good thing he was caught , he was breaking the law			0
however ... this all seems like something out of @entity2			0
it 's going to make a heck of a movie ! " the prospect of a film version also has @entity2 casting directors talking about which young actor might play the role of the barefoot bandit			1
" crash " and " @entity70 " casting director @entity69 did n't hesitate when asked which young @entity2 star would make a good barefoot bandit			1
" [ ' @entity74 ' star ] @entity76			1
... he 's young , he 's charming and he 's a really good actor , " @entity69 said			2
@entity76 's charm could come in handy , too			1

" " you do n't want somebody who ca n't act , but looks exactly like the guy , " she added , noting that it might be difficult to find an actor with @entity4 's 6 - foot - 5 frame -- which is why she suggests taller actors like " @entity115 ' " @entity116 and " @entity118 's " @entity117 .			2
