-- @entity2 's search engine was created when most of the @entity5 's information was open and available to anyone willing to capture it			1
in today 's more restrictive environment , @entity2 co-founder @entity8 and ceo @entity9 may not have even tried to start the company			1
" the kind of environment that we developed @entity2 in , the reason that we were able to develop a search engine , is the @entity5 was so open , " @entity8 told @entity12			2
" once you get too many rules , that will stifle innovation			0
" in an interview published sunday , @entity2 's co-founder cited a wide range of attacks on " the open @entity28 , " including government censorship and interception of data , overzealous attempts to protect intellectual property , and new communication portals that use web technologies and the internet , but under restrictive corporate control			1
there are " very powerful forces that have lined up against the open internet on all sides and around the world , " says @entity8			2
" i thought there was no way to put the genie back in the bottle , but now it seems in certain areas the genie has been put back in the bottle			0
" not coincidentally , these forces map directly onto three of @entity2 's biggest headaches as a business in the past few years			2
there 's no way for @entity2 's servers to crawl @entity56 's pages or @entity58 's smartphone apps for information			1
@entity61 's video clips , @entity62 and other key initiatives have had to grapple with both the media industries and government court rulings or legislation			0
and besides having to withdraw from @entity67 to @entity68 after a series of attacks and new censorship rules , @entity2 has been compelled to hand over user information to the @entity74 government , sometimes without being able to legally notify those users			1
" if we could be in some magical jurisdiction that everyone in the world trusted , that would be great , " says @entity8			0
" we 're doing it as well as can be done			0
" @entity8 lists several other threats to the open web ( and to @entity2 ) : -- smartphone apps , as led by @entity58 : " all the information in apps -- that data is not crawlable by @entity5 crawlers			1
you ca n't search it			0
" -- @entity56 , where data goes in but never comes out : " @entity56 has been sucking down @entity92 contacts for many years			0
" -- @entity93 and @entity94 , which @entity8 says would have led to the @entity74 using the same content - screening technology it has criticized @entity67 and @entity97 for using			1
with @entity93 and @entity94 , says @entity8 , fears of piracy had reduced the media industry to " shooting itself in the foot , or maybe worse than in the foot			1
" still , there 's a profound audacity in @entity105 bundling internet censorship in regimes like @entity67 , @entity108 and @entity97 , which restrict user access to the web , with @entity56 and @entity58 's platforms , which restrict @entity2 's			1
there may be a continuum of control and closure of the internet that connects repressive governments at one end and overbearing corporations at the other			0
the fight over the @entity93 / @entity94 legislation , where entertainment and technology companies , along with their users , fought it out in the halls of @entity129 , doubtlessly lies somewhere in between			2
but @entity2 is likewise doubtlessly a part of that continuum , not apart from it			2
because of its origin and the nature of its business , @entity2 's prospects are inexorably tied to the fate of the open web			1
but we have to resist the urge to make the two identical			0
@entity2 is n't just a web - crawling search company anymore			0
