the appearance friday in a lower @entity2 courtroom of @entity3 , @entity4 's son - in - law and one - time @entity6 spokesman , to face charges of conspiracy to kill @entity9 underlines the perhaps surprising fact that members of @entity4 's inner circle have been living in @entity13 for the past decade or so			1
it was @entity3 's decision to leave the comparative safety of his longtime refuge in @entity13 for @entity18 a few weeks ago that led to the chain of events that landed him in @entity2 for trial			2
the leading @entity18 newspaper , @entity24 , reported that @entity3 was detained in the @entity18 capital , @entity26 , in early february			0
@entity18 then decided to deport him to his native @entity27 via @entity28 , where he was intercepted by @entity30 agents , who escorted him to @entity31			0
as is well known , many of @entity4 's family and members of his inner circle fled @entity35 for @entity36 after the fall of the @entity38 in the winter of 2001 , but what is less well known is that some also fled to neighboring @entity13			1
according to @entity9 documents and officials , in addition to @entity3 , other of @entity4 's inner circle who ended up in @entity13 include the formidable military commander of @entity6 , @entity47 , a former @entity50 @entity49 officer who had fought against the @entity51 in @entity35 , as well as @entity52 , one of the @entity6 's leader older sons who has played some kind of leadership role in the group			1
@entity52 spent the first six months of 2002 living in @entity59 in southern @entity36			0
from there he helped one of his father 's wives , @entity64 , and several of his father 's children to move from @entity36 to @entity13			2
for years these @entity4 family members all lived in the @entity69 capital , @entity70 , under some form of house arrest			1
their conditions were not unpleasant , with time for visits to swimming pools and shopping trips			0
meanwhile , @entity9 intelligence learned that some @entity6 operatives were living in the northern @entity69 town of @entity80 , on the @entity81			2
in 2002 a @entity83 operation into @entity84 was planned and then rehearsed somewhere along the @entity9 @entity85			0
the chairman of the @entity87 , general @entity86 , called off the assault because the information about where precisely the @entity6 members were living in @entity80 was not clear			1
a year after that operation was called off , according to @entity9 and @entity94 officials , from his @entity69 refuge @entity47 authorized @entity6 's branch in @entity94 to launch a series of terrorist attacks in the @entity94 kingdom that began in the capital @entity101 in may 2003 , a campaign that killed scores of @entity94 and expatriates			2
@entity105 : trying @entity4 's son - in - law in @entity31 makes sense on the face of it , the fact that a number of @entity6 leaders and operatives and @entity4 family members found shelter in @entity13 is puzzling , as the @entity117 theocrats in the @entity69 regime are hostile to the @entity120 ultra zealots in @entity6 , and vice versa			1
for @entity6 's operatives , life in @entity13 was more secure than for many of their colleagues in @entity36 who risked capture by @entity36 forces working with the @entity129 or death by @entity129 drones			2
the @entity69 regime likely saw the @entity6 operatives as useful bargaining chips with the @entity9 in the event of some kind of peace negotiations with the @entity9			2
that peace deal , of course , never happened			0
of course , for @entity13 the adage , " the enemy of my enemy is my friend " may have also come into play , although there does n't seem to be evidence that @entity13 and @entity6 have ever cooperated on a specific operation			2
that said , the @entity147 found that of the 19 hijackers , " 8 to 10 of the 14 @entity94 " muscle " operatives traveled into or out of @entity13 between october 2000 and february 2001			0
" whether this was with any degree of @entity69 complicity is still an open question			0
the fact that leading members of @entity6 were based in @entity13 from 2002 on was known to the @entity9 government at the time			1
( in fact , in early 2003 counterterrorism officials briefed me about this development )			0
there is something of an irony here			0
this was during the same time period in which senior administration officials under president @entity169 were citing the alleged presence of @entity6 members in @entity172 and a supposedly burgeoning alliance between @entity6 and @entity175 's leader @entity174 as a key reason to go to war against @entity174 , @entity13 's bitter enemy			1
five years after the invasion of @entity175 , the @entity178 concluded , as had every other official investigation of the matter , that in fact there was no " cooperative relationship " between @entity174 and @entity6			2
in late 2008 @entity6 operatives kidnapped @entity186 , an @entity69 diplomat , in the western @entity36 city of @entity188			0
after holding the diplomat for over a year the militants quietly released him back to @entity13 in the spring of 2010			0
this was part of a deal that allowed some of @entity4 's family and @entity6 members living under house arrest in @entity13 to depart , according to a @entity36 official familiar with the deal			1
this deal did not , however , mean that relations between the @entity69 and @entity6 suddenly became all hunky dory			0
documents recovered at @entity4 's compound in @entity205 , @entity36 , following the @entity83 raid there on may 1 , 2011 , and since publicly released portray a rather tense relationship between @entity6 and the @entity69 authorities			1
in a letter that @entity4 wrote just five days before he died he described a document from his son @entity211 who had lived in @entity13 for years " which exposes the truth of the @entity69 regime			1
" what @entity4 meant precisely by this is not clear , but taken together with some of the other letters that were found in his @entity205 compound it is obvious that @entity4 and his men were quite distrustful of the @entity69 regime			0
a letter to @entity4 from his chief of staff dated 11 june 2009 has a detailed account about a group of " mid level " @entity6 members who the @entity69 had recently released , including three @entity50 , a @entity225 , a @entity175 and a @entity226			1
@entity4 's chief of staff attributed these releases to @entity6 's kidnapping of the @entity69 diplomat in @entity188 , but added that the @entity69 " do n't want to show that they are negotiating with us or reacting to our pressure			1
... we ask @entity234 to repel their evil			0
" in another undated letter from @entity4 to his chief off staff @entity6 's leader gave a set of detailed instructions about how best to handle his family members living in @entity13 once they were released			1
@entity4 urged extreme caution " since the @entity69 are not to be trusted			0
" among another precautions , he wrote that his family members " should be warned about the importance of getting rid of everything they received from @entity13 like baggage or anything even as small as a needle , as there are eavesdropping chips that have been developed to be so small they can be put inside a medical syringe			0
" in this letter @entity4 mentioned by name a number of his children living in @entity13 including his sons @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 and his daughter @entity264 , who is married to @entity3 who now sits in a @entity2 jail			2
in october the @entity266 named as terrorists six @entity6 members living in @entity13 who it said are funding terrorist activities in @entity36 and sending fighters and money to @entity274 to fight the @entity276 regime there			1
@entity3 did n't play an operational role in @entity6 -- a fact that was underlined in the charges filed against him last week in @entity2 that revolve around his role as a propagandist for the group			0
so it is the precise nature of @entity6 's arrangements in @entity13 and the kind of activities outlined in the recent @entity266 designation of the half - dozen @entity6 members living in @entity13 that are likely to be of most interest to @entity9 investigators			1
given the fact that since 9/11 , @entity31 courts have convicted at a rate of 100 % in cases that involve members of @entity6 and associated groups , @entity3 could doubtless cut an attractive plea deal for himself if he gives a full accounting of @entity6 's murky decade in @entity13 .			1

@entity4 's son - in - law , now in custody , had spent time in @entity13
@entity304 says members of @entity4 's inner circle lived for years in @entity13
he says it was an odd tie since *religious* *differences* separate @entity13 from @entity120
@entity105 : @entity13 may have wanted to use @entity6 members as a bargaining chip with @entity9
