@entity0 dropped the phone and screamed when she heard the news that her son was dead			1
@entity4 had drowned while rafting on a lake with friends			2
the 16 - year - old did n't know how to swim , and he was n't wearing a life jacket			2
" i could n't believe it , i did n't want to believe it : that just like that , my son had drowned and he was gone , " she said , recalling the 2006 tragedy			1
@entity0 had worried about her son 's safety when it came to street violence or driving , and she said she had always warned him of those dangers			1
but water accidents never crossed her mind			0
" it did not occur to me that my son would drown because he did n't know water safety , " she said			2
" @entity4 was never taught the basic life skill of learning how to swim			2
" @entity4 was not alone in the black community			0
according to @entity29 , 70 % of @entity28 children can not swim , compared with nearly 60 % for @entity31 children and 42 % for white children			1
according to the @entity35 , @entity28 - @entity28 children between the ages of 5 and 14 are three times more likely to drown than white children in the same age range			1
as @entity0 tried to make sense of her son 's tragedy , she realized she had passed her own inexperience to her son			1
her father had witnessed a drowning when he was young and instilled in her a fear of water			0
" so as a child , i never went around water , " said @entity0 , 58			1
" i never went swimming			0
i did n't know anything about water or life jackets and water safety			0
" because of this fear , @entity0 raised @entity4 without any exposure to water			1
but today , she is determined to prevent other mothers from doing the same			0
in 2007 , she started the @entity60 , a nonprofit that provides low - cost swimming lessons for children in @entity64 , @entity65			1
" after losing my son , i wanted to do something to help other people , to help another mother not have to suffer the way i do every day from the loss of a child drowning , " she said			2
to date , the @entity60 has helped more than 1,000 children learn how to swim			1
" all children are at risk of drowning , but the majority of the children that the @entity60 serves are minority children , who we have found are more at risk , " @entity0 said			1
several cultural and historical factors can help explain why that is			0
one is the segregation of swimming pools during the 20th century , according to @entity87 , author of " @entity88 : a @entity89 in @entity90			0
" relatively few swimming pools were built to serve the black community back then , so much of a generation was denied the opportunity to swim , @entity87 told the @entity95			0
also , if parents ca n't swim , their children are far less likely to learn how , according to a recent study conducted by the @entity100			1
the study , sponsored by @entity29 , found that a fear of drowning and a fear of injury prevent many @entity28 - @entity28 parents from putting their children in swimming lessons			0
it also found that many avoid swimming for cosmetic reasons , such as the effect chlorinated water has on their hair			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity117 for some families today , it 's still tough to find an accessible pool			1
" the public pools near our home have been closed in the past , and other places were not affordable , " said @entity121 , whose 14 - year - old son , @entity122 , is one of 60 - plus students in the @entity124 this season			0
the swimming lessons take place at a local high school over four saturdays for a total cost of $ 10			0
" i am less worried if ( @entity122 ) is near water because he has the basics of how to swim , " @entity134 said			0
" and we 're thankful for that			0
" @entity0 is doing much more , however , than just providing swimming lessons			1
" she ups the awareness , and that is half the battle , " said @entity140 , a swimming coach who was so inspired by her story that he created a @entity60 swimming program at @entity143 in @entity144			1
" once these communities learn how to swim , they will pass it down , which results in future generations that know how to swim			2
" @entity0 said she has two goals for the future : one is to change the drowning statistics of minority children , and the other is to have an aquatic center where the children can swim daily instead of just once a week			1
" the joy on the faces of those children -- when they see that they can learn , once they get it -- they are so happy with themselves , " she said			2
" and it 's like all of them are my children			0
it 's like i did n't lose my son			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity60 website at www.joshproject.org and see how to help .			2

the @entity60 has helped more than 1,000 children in @entity65 learn to swim
most of them are minorities , according to @entity0 , whose son drowned in 2006
statistics show that minority children are less likely than white children to know how to swim
