-- approaching @entity3 's interview with @entity4 , i had been thinking the @entity5 -- in his type of language -- was " done with cycling			1
" used , abused and accused by fans and federations , no doubt he was feeling he had been rolled over by the cycling world , despite his years of sacrifice and heroics			2
after all , had n't they taken the ride with him ? enjoyed the fame , bought the story and sold it -- all packaged up in a shiny cover			0
those rulemakers and followers , who now wanted their pound of flesh , were n't they the same ones who had spouted the promises of globalization , dreamed of expanding markets and then cuddled up for the photo opportunity with the @entity32 that the @entity3 show brought to the table ? for a sport struggling with an image problem , @entity3 was their savior			1
jeez , even the @entity36 pretended they liked it and as long as the dollars kept rolling in , they were happy to put up with a bit of @entity42			0
now it 's all come to an end and it 's a rather sad , dirty end to what was supposed to be a disney-esque fairytale in lycra			0
the savior is a sinner after all			0
cycling had n't wanted to see @entity3 as anything other than the big , brash , bold @entity52			1
it suited their needs to see the fierce competitor , the athlete who dominated the @entity56 seven times , forgetting that behind the facade was a man just like other men -- not perfect , but flawed			0
do n't forget it was those very flaws of character which made @entity3 the competitor , the one who would do what it took to win and came to consider performance enhancing drugs as part of his job			1
in a culture which for so many years had had such an expectancy to cheat whenever possible , there was nobody to question him			0
nobody to stop him taking control of the process -- planning it and perfecting it			0
it was a process @entity3 called easy and it was if that process became more fulfilling than the victories and the fame , which may seem crazy , but then again the top athlete are rarely wired in the same way as the rest of the population			1
competitors like @entity3 have stuff to prove to themselves , and to others , and it 's rarely pretty			1
@entity91 : tell us your take on the first part of the interview cycling fans rejoiced in his ruthlessness , his commitment and his brutal desire to win			2
meanwhile his sponsors -- some of the world 's biggest brands remember -- had willingly used him to promote their products , build the image and sell the dream			0
with his confession all that is over and @entity3 sees the anger of those same people who wanted to believe			1
my biggest surprise was that the @entity4 interview did not descend into the all too common excuses and crocodile tears we have seen from those in a similar predicament			1
there was no blaming anyone else , no recriminations and no hiding that he did it			0
@entity3 taking the blame -- that is what shocked me the most			1
there 's no doubt he has been aided by others in his quest to prove what he wanted to prove , but @entity3 accepts the responsibility for the deception and he accepts that the fallout is going to come his way			1
when did that last happen with a figure as big as @entity3 had become ? previous award winners of " most hated cyclist " all denied it was them or that they really did cheat			1
pathetically , some of them said it was others that did it -- much like a 10 - year - old would -- or that they had thought about it but then could n't			0
arguably none of them has told the story in the way @entity3 has done			1
@entity3 had tried the denials , told us all about the tests he had passed and convinced most people -- who did n't have the knowledge of just how tainted cycling was -- that he was clean			1
and now on @entity4 's sofa , just when we were all expecting more of the same , it 's been replaced with an honesty which shocks			1
there still remains a glimmer of hope for the sport of cycling			0
@entity3 said as much when he admitted the new drug testing and whereabouts program was working			2
it 's no longer as easy to cheat , the culture is finally changing , but that 's a process which is going to hurt the governing bodies just as much as the dramas which are going to arrive on @entity3 's doorstep			2
i do n't feel sorry for @entity3 and refreshingly i do n't get the feeling he has asked me to feel sorry for him			2
he did it -- he was the bully , the liar , the one hiding behind the image			2
it 'll take many years for him to recover from where he is at the moment and it might be the case that he never does in many people 's eyes			0
the cancer community and his @entity189 work is now all that remains of what @entity3 did right			2
cycling , indeed sport in general , has been deeply damaged by the @entity5 , and by those who advised , supplied and turned the other cheek because it suited them as well			0
but you know what ? the new @entity3 that tells the truth and accepts his mistakes still has hope because finally he 's realized it 's ok to be human			2
that 's a person some could , despite the current mess , begin to forgive			0
it wo n't be easy though .			0
