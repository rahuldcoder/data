@entity0 -- like the alchemists who once tried to turn lead into gold , a green entrepreneur says he has found a cost - effective method for turning plastic trash into oil			1
the @entity10 plant turns plastic garbage into oil by isolating petroleum from the plastic 's other ingredients			1
during a recent visit to his new demonstration plant in @entity19 , @entity10 ceo @entity16 describes his process : waste plastic is shredded and melted and then processed in a way that separates the petroleum from the rest of the ingredients			1
at one end of the machinery , shredded plastic trash is dumped in a hopper and goes up a conveyor belt into a " reactor			2
" at the other end is a spaghetti of pipes and valves and tanks			0
@entity16 turns open a spigot on one of the pipes and produces a liquid the color of apple juice			1
it smells kind of like diesel , and @entity16 claims it 's ready to be processed for any number of uses : fueling cars , diesel generators or even jets			1
but not all of the ingredients in plastic can be refined into petroleum			2
all the chemicals that were added when the plastic was produced must be separated out and collected in a sediment tank			2
that could be a problem , says @entity59 , a researcher with the environmental group @entity60			0
he has not visited the plant , but after reading @entity10 's literature , he asked , " what happens to the additives and the metals and the other things ? " @entity10 is hoping to find asphalt makers who can use the sludge as an ingredient for paving after the metals are filtered out			1
otherwise , it can be dried by microwaving and the dust sent to a landfill			0
" then you end up with a different problem , " @entity59 said			0
" is that going to a hazardous waste landfill ? " but @entity16 says that it 's not hazardous , and most important , that the process releases no gas into the air			1
" you do n't smell anything burning , " he said			0
" we do n't incinerate			0
" @entity16 set up his demonstration at the @entity87 dump in @entity19			2
amid bales of crushed yogurt containers and plastic bottles , there seems to be little risk that he will run out of trash to feed into his machine			0
@entity10 is pitching the technology to sanitation departments , promising it will cut down on their trash volume by consuming up to 10,000 tons of plastic per year while producing some revenue as well			1
the plant could produce up to 60,000 barrels of oil a year , @entity16 says , and although some of that oil is used to keep the machinery running , the rest can be sold to an oil company for profit			1
the plant cost $ 4 million to build , but @entity16 says it can produce oil for as little as $ 10 a barrel at a time when oil is selling for more than $ 70 a barrel			2
@entity59 said that " finding new oil to burn is not the goal			0
the goal should be to burn less oil			0
" but @entity16 said , " if there 's a way that we can solve the problem of accumulation of waste plastic in our country and at the same time turn it into a byproduct that is cost effective , then i think it 's a win - win situation			1
" @entity1 's @entity130 contributed to this report			0

@entity134 entrepreneur says he 's found safe , *inexpensive* way to turn plastic into oil
@entity10 ceo @entity16 : plastic waste is shredded , melted and processed
process creates liquid that @entity16 says can be used for fuel
@entity16 says @entity10 process does n't release gases into the air
