-- @entity2 's new movie , " @entity1 , " is a modern - day minstrel show judging from the trailer and @entity2 's comments promoting the film while dressed as the film 's star , " gen. @entity7 , " the leader of a fictitious @entity11 country			1
@entity2 , who is not of @entity11 heritage , plays this @entity11 character while sporting a long fake beard and speaking in a strong @entity16 accent , which would be fine , except the character is showcasing the worst stereotypes of @entity11			1
for example , at a news conference in @entity20 this week promoting his film , @entity2 exclaimed : " welcome devils of the @entity25 media and death to the @entity27			1
" he then joked about liking tv shows that showed @entity11 terrorists killing @entity30 and admiring fashion designer @entity31 for hating the @entity32			1
to me , this is essentially the same as white performers in blackface portraying black people in buffoonish negative stereotypes for the enjoyment of white @entity30			1
but i am not advocating a ban on offensive comments or the telling of culturally insensitive jokes			0
i certainly am not calling for more @entity45 comedy			0
i 'm not calling for a boycott of anyone nor asking for one more insincere " i 'm sorry to all those who were offended by me " from a celebrity			0
i 'm in no way arguing that @entity11 culture is off - limits or can not be mocked			1
i 'm a comedian of @entity11 heritage and have performed comedy shows not only for @entity11 - @entity30 groups across the @entity30 , but also in the @entity57 , from @entity58 to @entity59 to @entity60			1
i find the biggest laughs are elicited when performers hold up a comic mirror to @entity11 culture			1
but for some reason , the entertainment industry appears to truly enjoy ridiculing " brown " people , arabs and @entity67 , and has no qualms about casting people not of our heritage to portray us			0
indeed , just last week @entity73 snack company found itself embroiled in a controversy because an ad showed @entity76 playing an @entity67 character in brownface , similar to what @entity2 is doing in " the @entity80			2
" here is my simple request to the entertainment industry : if you are going to mock and ridicule us for profit , can you at least cast @entity11 and @entity67 to play us ? and while we 're at it , why not include us in the creative process as co-writers and directors ? if you look at the names of the writers , co-stars and director of " @entity1 , " none is of @entity11 heritage			2
@entity97 , who is of @entity67 heritage , co-stars , but if you do n't know the difference between @entity11 and @entity67 , go to @entity100			1
and let 's be honest , these types of buffoonish " brownface " stereotypes would not be permitted if it were any other minority group			2
what would the reaction be if a white actor in blackface mocked african - american culture ? or if an actor of @entity11 heritage pitched a movie about the leader of a fictitious jewish state in which he would portray the @entity32 leader and showcase the worst stereotypes of @entity32 ? is there any chance that film would get the green light from a @entity121 studio ? i understand that the entertainment industry is about making money , not correcting negative stereotypes -- even those they helped perpetuate			1
but why not cast a person who is actually @entity11 as the sidekick to the star who is pretending to be @entity11 ? arabs and @entity131 have long been ghettoized in @entity121 , playing almost exclusively cab drivers , deli workers , terrorists and the occasional " good " guy who works with law enforcement , and who is usually killed later in the movie by a bad " brown " guy			2
but here 's the thing @entity121 : adding people of our heritage to the movie is actually good business			0
it would help the film rise above the superficial and cliched material we have seen for years when it comes to @entity11 and @entity67 on the screen			1
for example , the jokes in " @entity1 " trailer sound like a less clever version of the material you would hear from comedian @entity159 's ventriloquist dummy " @entity160			2
" @entity121 learned this very lesson years ago when it made mafia movies with no @entity163 involved in the creative process or as stars			0
those films failed because they lacked any true understanding of @entity163 culture , which would have enhanced the film			0
that changed when @entity171 hired @entity172 , then a little - known director , to helm " @entity174			0
" in turn , @entity172 hired talented but unknown @entity163 - @entity30 actors such as @entity177 and @entity178 ( " @entity179 " ) to be co-stars			0
the rest is cinematic history			0
in time , there will likely be an @entity11 and @entity67 - @entity30 @entity184 and @entity185			1
and that will come from a combination of the artists in those communities creating their own projects -- which is increasingly happening -- but also being cast in the bigger budget @entity121 movies			0
the big studio movies have the greatest reach and are the ones which create stars who then have the ability to get movies made that would present their culture in a more nuanced and entertaining manner			0
" @entity1 " may turn out to be a blockbuster hit or a big budget miss. but i can assure you that the film would have been better if it included some input from the very community being ridiculed by the film			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity211 : @entity2 plays an @entity11 *dictator* showing worst stereotypes of @entity11
he says it 's the same as whites in blackface performing vicious stereotypes of blacks
@entity11 culture is not off - limits for comedy , he says , it 's just that these jokes are n't based in truth
@entity211 : if real @entity11 had some input , jokes could rise above the superficial and clich√©d
