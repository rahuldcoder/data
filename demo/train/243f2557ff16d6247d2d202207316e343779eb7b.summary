-- the pilot of the @entity4 plane that crashed in @entity5 on saturday was making his first landing with a @entity7 at @entity8 , the airline said			1
but it was n't his first time flying to @entity5			1
the pilot , @entity12 , had flown from @entity13 to the city several times between 1999 and 2004 , the airline said			2
he has also clocked 43 hours flying a @entity7			1
[ previous story , updated at 10:14 p.m. et ] @entity17 : pilots attempted to abort landing 1.5 seconds before impact ( @entity0 ) -- the cockpit voice recorder of @entity21 appears to show the pilots tried to abort the landing less than two seconds before the plane crashed on the runway at @entity8 , the head of the @entity17 said sunday			1
the plane 's voice and flight data recorders show that the flight from @entity32 was coming in too slow and too low and that the pilots appear to have increased speed seven seconds before impact , @entity27 said			1
a stall warning sounded four seconds before the crash , and the crew then made an internal decision " to initiate a go - around 1.5 seconds to impact , " she said			1
the @entity17 's preliminary assessment of the plane 's cockpit and flight data recorders appear to indicate that the flight went from a routine landing to a disaster in a matter of seconds			1
but when asked if pilot error was to blame , @entity27 said the crash landing was still under investigation			1
" i would discourage anyone from drawing any conclusions at this point , " she said , adding that investigators are still working to corroborate the information on the recorders			0
but what happened inside the cockpit of the @entity7 may well be the key factor in saturday 's accident that killed two people , injured 182 and forced the temporary closure of one of the country 's largest airports			1
amateur video obtained exclusively by @entity0 on sunday shows the plane approaching the runway and striking what appears to be a seawall before spinning counterclockwise and coming to a stop			2
@entity71 said he shot the video about a mile from the crash scene			0
related : @entity4 crash : at a glance some of the answers to what happened may just hinge on what investigators found on the voice and flight data recorders			0
" what we need to do is corroborate the information we have both on the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder , " @entity27 said			0
" ... but i 'll tell you some of the things we are seeing on the flight data recorder are mirroring some of the things that are going on on the cockpit voice recorder			0
" for example , she said , the increase of power in the engines appears to correlate with the cockpit crew 's internal decision to do a " go - around , " a call to abort the landing and try it again			1
@entity21 , with 291 passengers and 16 crew members , was at the end of a more than 10 - hour direct flight from @entity13 , @entity32 , when it began its descent			1
according to the recorders , the flight 's approach appeared normal as the 777 descended , and " there is no discussion of aircraft approach " among the crew			1
the target air speed for the approach of the flight was 137 knots , and the crew can be heard on the cockpit voice recorder acknowledging the speed , @entity27 said			1
but the speed was significantly below 137 knots , and " we are not talking about a few knots , " she said			2
at about four seconds before the plane crash landed , the pilots received an " aural and physical " warning inside the cockpit that the plane was on the verge of an aerodynamic stall , meaning it was about to lose its ability to stay in the air			1
the warning -- known as a " stick shaker " -- included a verbal warning the plane that was flying too low and a physical warning when the throttle shook			1
@entity32 and @entity17 investigators will jointly question @entity12 , the pilot who was sitting in the captain 's seat of @entity21 , on monday , @entity142 - ho , the head of @entity32 's @entity143 , said			1
@entity12 had 43 hours of experience flying the @entity145 , he said			1
they will also question @entity147 , who was sitting in the co-pilot 's seat , @entity142 said			2
@entity4 ceo and president @entity151 has said there was no engine failure , to his knowledge			0
@entity32 investigators will work alongside @entity156 investigators			1
the @entity17 has ruled out weather as a problem and said that conditions were right for a " visual landing			1
" but investigators are looking into whether construction at the airport may have played a role			2
construction to extend a runway safety area temporarily shut off the so - called glide slope system , which is one of several options pilots have to help them land planes safely , @entity27 said			1
@entity171 damage to the plane is " really striking , " she said , and officials are thankful there were n't more deaths			2
survivors of the crash were being treated sunday for injuries ranging from paralysis to " severe road rash			0
" in all , 182 people were hospitalized and 123 others walked away from the crash landing			2
the number who emerged unscathed prompted the city 's fire chief to describe it as " nothing short of a miracle			2
" on the runway , medics found the bodies of the two teen girls lying next to burning wreckage			0
they were identified by @entity4 as @entity196 and @entity197 , both @entity199 nationals			0
" we were expecting a lot of burns , " said dr. @entity200 , @entity201 's chief of surgery			2
" but we did n't see them			0
" at @entity201 , 17 survivors remained hospitalized , six of them in critical condition			0
related : passengers knew they were too low many of the injured said they were sitting toward the rear of the aircraft , said @entity200			0
several suffered abdominal injuries and spine fractures , some of which include paralysis and head trauma , she said			0
many patients also were treated for " severe road rash , " which suggests " that they were dragged , " @entity200 said			0
the conditions of victims at other hospitals were not made public sunday			0
survivors and witnesses reported the 7 - year - old airliner appeared to be flying too low as it approached the end of a runway near the bay			1
expert : the plane ' should never have been close to the seawall ' airport technology called the @entity235 , or @entity235 -- which normally would help pilots correctly approach the runway -- was not operating at the time , according to a @entity240 bulletin			1
the @entity235 integrates with the aircraft 's cockpit to trigger an audible warning , consultant and retired 777 pilot @entity245 told @entity0			1
" you hear a mechanical voice that says , ' too low , too low , too low			0
' " the @entity235 is " nice to have , " @entity245 said , " but it 's not critical on the 777			1
" there are redundant systems aboard the aircraft that would provide similar warnings if the plane was coming in too low , said @entity245 , who has landed 777s hundreds of times			0
the pilot operating the aircraft was a veteran who had been flying for @entity4 since 1996 , the airline said			2
witnesses recount the crash survivors reported hearing no warning from the cockpit before the landing			0
passengers scrambled to exit a crash scene that one survivor described as " surreal			0
" when rescuers arrived , they found some passengers coming out of the water , said city fire chief @entity271			0
" there was a fire on the plane , so the assumption might be that they went near the water 's edge , which is very shallow , to maybe douse themselves with water , " she said			2
related : why the crash was survivable some jumped out or slid down emergency chutes with luggage in hand			0
statistically , 2012 was the safest year in terms of aviation accidents worldwide since 1945 , according to the @entity289			0
data show that there were 23 fatal airliner accidents , which caused 511 deaths , according to @entity289 stats			0
that 's well below the 10 - year annual average of 34 accidents and 773 fatalities			2
survival rates have improved due to better staff training and safety advances during the 1980s and 1990s , according to the group			0
@entity4 's flight history over last 20 years			0
