@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the middle of a famine , there is a place that houses the sickest survivors of all			1
along the border between @entity11 and @entity1 at the @entity13 hospital it is simply called a stabilization center			1
as a medical term , it refers to the desire to normalize vital signs , replace fluids and treat acute and deadly illness			0
as you might imagine , however , this place is far from stable , and instead filled with people who are starving to death -- in some cases , their bodies too far gone to even absorb the food finally made available to them			1
i met 6 - year - old @entity31 there			1
as soon as he entered @entity0 refugee camp with his father after 10 days of walking under the @entity38 sun , it was clear his tiny prone body may have been robbed of nutrition for too long			2
@entity41 : how you can help as dr. @entity47 told me , " he is half the size he should be -- a couple more weeks , and this child would 've been lost			0
" @entity47 knows , because over the last few months , he has seen it happen more times than he cares to remember			0
there is no way to dignify the description of death by starvation			2
it is neither quick nor painless			0
not too long after the food is cut off , the body resorts to fuel reserves in the liver and fatty tissues			1
once the fat is all gone , and the person is a skeleton of what he or she once was , the body searches for protein , and finds it in muscle tissue			1
even the muscle of the heart is consumed , leaving someone drained and listless			2
the pulse , the blood pressure and body temperature all precipitously drop			2
little kids such as @entity31 completely stop growing and become stunted in time			1
the tools they use here in the stabilization center are rudimentary , and they have little choice -- but they work			0
a small tape measure is used to measure the child 's mid-upper arm circumference or @entity85			1
it takes just seconds and is predictive of how much deep fat still exists in the body , a key criterion when assessing starvation			1
in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years , a healthy @entity85 is considered to be above 13.5 centimeters , and if it is less than 11.5 centimeters , nearly one in five die			2
they simply can not be saved			0
@entity31 had his @entity85 measured in the stabilization center -- 10.5 centimeters			1
@entity47 shook his head worriedly and immediately started a plan to save @entity31			1
an iv was placed , and fluids were started slowly			0
too much fluid could overwhelm his system			0
the same could be said of many foods , which may cause severe diarrhea or vomiting			0
@entity31 will be given @entity105 , a paste that has a balance of protein , carbohydrates and fat , along with vitamins and minerals			1
the key is to give a lot of calories in small amounts because @entity31 's stomach is so shrunken from his malnutrition			1
@entity31 would have his blood drawn to check for anemia and possible bacterial infections			1
@entity47 said he is cautiously optimistic about @entity31 , but he carries a lot of anguish over what he has seen this summer			2
" i have a 5 - year - old boy at home , " he told me as his eyes welled up			2
i shook his hand , looked him in the eye and said , " give him an extra tight hug tonight			0
" he nodded and said , " you too			0
" my thoughts turned to my own three little girls , who are always in my heart			0
i will , doctor , i said			0

@entity13 hospital is filled with people starving to death
@entity31 , 6 , is treated for malnutrition at hospital on @entity11 - @entity1 border
once fat is all gone , a starving person 's body resorts to eating muscle tissue
*patients* like @entity31 must be given calories in small amounts because of shrunken stomachs
