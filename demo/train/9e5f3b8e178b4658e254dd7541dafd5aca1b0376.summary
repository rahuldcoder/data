@entity0 -- @entity3 has broken up an @entity5 terror cell that planned a coordinated attack that included bombing the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity3 authorities said wednesday			1
three men -- two from @entity0 and one from the @entity11 -- have been arrested in connection with the plot that called for a double suicide bombing targeting the embassy and the @entity16 , according to @entity3 's @entity18 intelligence agency			1
it is the second time in recent months that authorities claim to have halted an @entity5 attack planned by @entity22 militants , according to @entity3 media			1
in november , authorities claimed three @entity22 with ties to @entity5 were killed by @entity3 troops during a gunfight in the @entity11 , according to the reports			1
the @entity3 intelligence agency alleged wednesday @entity33 of @entity0 is " the relevant member " of the three - man operation , a statement released by @entity18 's media office said			1
@entity33 was allegedly recruited by @entity5 to go to @entity34 for training and return to @entity3 , where he was to connect with others who were to have entered the country using forged @entity39 documents , the statement said			1
the arrests came as peace talks were under way in @entity43 , @entity44 , to end the @entity34 civil war , a conflict where violence has been spilled into neighboring countries and raised fears it could destabilize the region			0
chief among those fears is that the chaos generated by the conflict has allowed an @entity5 - linked group to take hold in @entity34 , attracting foreign fighters who can strike neighboring countries			0
while authorities did not say how far along @entity61 and the others allegedly were in carrying out the plot , the intelligence agency claims it seized computer files sent from @entity65 that instructed @entity33 in the manufacturing of explosives			1
@entity33 allegedly mapped routes to the convention center and had checked out the @entity71 embassy			1
he also was accused of planning an shooting rampage on a bus going from @entity0 to @entity74 , an @entity3 settlement in the @entity11			1
as part of the plan , according to @entity18 , the attack would include shooting out the wheels of the bus in an attempt to overturn it			0
former @entity82 operative and national security analyst @entity81 questioned the credibility of the threat posed by @entity33			0
" i do n't think it is credible			1
it may have been aspirational , " he said on @entity1 's @entity87			1
" they may have had the plans on the books and sent people here and there , but @entity5 ca n't operate in the @entity11 or @entity0 or @entity65			0
it is too difficult for them ... the @entity3 have the place too well wired for them to get away with this			2
" the @entity71 is working to corroborate the details , @entity98 deputy spokeswoman @entity97 told reporters			2
" we 've been in contact with the @entity3 government regarding these threats			2
we 're closely monitoring the situation , " she said			0
" ... i do n't have independent corroboration of some of those specifics			0
our folks are working on that right now			0
but because this was @entity3 information , i 'd point you to them for the corroboration			2
but obviously we 're looking into it as well			0
i do n't have reason to believe it 's not true			2
i just do n't have independent verification			0
" @entity118 and @entity119 reported from @entity0 , and @entity120 reported and wrote from @entity121			0
@entity1 's @entity122 contributed to this report .			0
