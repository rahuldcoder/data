-- sea - levels are rising unevenly around the world , with @entity4 countries in particular suffering significant increases over the past two decades , according to accurate new satellite data			1
on average , global sea - levels have been rising at about three millimeters ( mm ) a year , however , this masks large differences between regions of the world			1
while some regions have seen sea - level rises of 12 mm a year , others have actually seen decreases of about 12 mm a year			1
the results are based on radar readings from the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) over an 18 - year period from october 1992 to march 2010			2
@entity18 used its satellites to send radar pulses to the sea surface below , recording the time delay in its return and creating a precise measurement of their height above the surface			0
special report : sea - level rises scientists say sea - level rises are the result of the expansion of water due to rising temperatures , melting of glaciers and the melting of polar ice sheets			2
the worst hit regions over the past two decades , according to the @entity18 data , have been the @entity4 countries of @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and vulnerable pacific islands like the @entity48			2
the @entity46 for one is already frequently subjected to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rain , with seasonal monsoon rains in august killing at least 11 people			0
scientists suggest regions that have seen high sea level rises over the past 20 years will not necessarily continue to see higher than average sea - level rises in the future			1
" we suspect that the bigger the differences get , the more they will tend to level out in the future , " says @entity60 , a spokesperson for @entity18			0
however , a recent study of coastal cities still predicted the @entity46 ' capital @entity67 would see its vulnerability to flooding double by the end of the century , due to sea - level rises			2
in some regions of the world , the increasingly accurate sea level data is being used by planners to mitigate against the risk of flooding			0
see also : five cities battling flooding , heats and storms in @entity82 , where the sea - level data was released , engineers are constructing a new set of tidal barriers to protect the historic city			1
the city , which attracts millions of tourists every year , is seeing sea - level rises of around 2 mm per year , together with slow , mostly natural , subsidence of about another 2 mm every year			1
the new $ 7.9 billion - barrier system will see giant barriers placed on the sea floor around @entity82			0
when the water levels rise , air will be pumped into the barriers raising them up to block the tidal flow and protect the city from flooding			0
the system is due to be completed in 2014 and is expected to be able to protect the city for the next 20 years .			0

global sea - levels rose by an average of 3 mm a year over the past two decades
most accurate data yet based on satellite data from @entity18
sea - level rises uneven around the world with @entity4 hit worst
