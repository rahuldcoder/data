-- eid in the @entity3 household was always a very special occasion for me ; it was when i 'd get to see family and friends and , most of all , i could eat myself silly , gorging on amazing @entity10 food ! what sticks in the memory most was the build - up ; this would begin several days prior to @entity1 -- mum would be busy preparing the sauces and marinades which were invariably rich , vibrant reds and greens			1
the aromas emanating from the kitchen were so intense that our mouths watered in anticipation as our bellies simultaneously whined " are we there yet ? " @entity0 celebrates : weird and wonderful summer traditions the day went something like this : we 'd be up extremely early and the food fest would begin with @entity32 for breakfast			2
this is a lovely vermicelli and milk pudding , spiced with cardamom and cinnamon and served with an @entity39 rusk			0
morning cravings sated , we 'd then make our way to the @entity42 for prayer until around 11am			0
as we were leaving the mosque , i remember feeling excited at the prospect of going home for a huge selection of tasty deep - fried goodies , which usually consisted of samosas ( lamb and potato and chicken and pea ) , pakoras and lentil and ginger cakes , all served with relishes and tomato ketchup			1
at this point , people would be gathered at the house and we 'd make visits to friends ' and relatives ' houses , where we 'd be treated to sweet tea and samosas			2
around 1pm we 'd get back to a house full of people and start tucking into a delicious lunch of mutton yakhni pulao , a classic rice dish from @entity75 ; this would be accompanied by lamb and chicken kormas -- very lightly spiced with aromatic milk sauces			0
there 'd always be a boiled egg added too			0
in addition , there would be spiced roast chicken and spicy kebabs			0
dessert always tended to be coconut samosas and sweet semolina			0
@entity1 is a particularly ostentatious event and , i can remember mum putting silver leaf on the rice and puddings as decoration			1
@entity0 celebrates : the world 's best fireworks displays i would have to say that @entity98 / pulaos , samosas , kebabs and @entity39 sweets and puddings best showcase the culinary traditions around @entity1			1
if i were cooking to impress i would stick to these traditional , simple dishes			1
i say simple , but aesthetics aside , they 're anything but ; this food 's actually very intricate as the flavors have to be subtle , which is quite difficult to pull off , especially in the case of a pulao			2
in my opinion , if you can make a perfect pulao the culinary aspect of @entity1 will be a joyous time and a huge success , as all the other dishes are complementary to it .			1
