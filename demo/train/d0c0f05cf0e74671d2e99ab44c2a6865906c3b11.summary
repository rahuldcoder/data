-- the @entity1 have been invited by @entity3 president @entity2 to lay down their arms after government forces retook the city of @entity7 friday , once the center of power for the rebel group			1
@entity3 's president @entity2 has called on the @entity1 to stop fighting			1

the bomber , riding a motorcycle , blew himself up outside air force headquarters in @entity13 , killing two air force police officers and a member of the bomb - disposal unit , authorities said			0
the new year may signal a turn in @entity3 's conflict -- but it is unlikely to be an end			1
the @entity1 have their roots in the earliest days of @entity3 's independence in 1948			1
but since then they have grown from a political group intent on protecting their rights to a fierce rebel movement classified by the @entity36 and others as a terrorist organization			0
the conflict between the @entity1 and the government has lasted more than 25 years and left at least 65,000 people dead			1
the @entity1 are part of the island 's minority tamils , an ethnic group that has lived on the island for centuries since their ancestors came over from southern @entity49			1
these @entity50 are distinct from @entity51 , an even smaller minority , who came with the @entity55 colonists in the 19th century			0
@entity3 's majority @entity56 have lived on the island much longer than the @entity43 and represent about three - quarters of the population , according to the @entity60			1
most historians believe they came over from northern @entity49 in the 6th century @entity62 it was @entity3 's post-independence government that sparked the rise of the @entity1			1
after 1948 , tamils started growing uneasy with the country 's unitary government and apprehensive that the @entity56 might abuse @entity70 rights			1
they felt marginalized when @entity71 became prime minister after winning the 1956 elections on a platform of @entity56 nationalism			0
the @entity43 bristled at his declaration that @entity77 would be the official language and protested against government policies deemed favorable to the @entity56			0
violence and radicalization started to grow during the following decades , and by the 1970s , @entity70 politicians were demanding a separate @entity70 state -- @entity84 -- in northern and eastern @entity3 , the @entity43 ' traditional homeland			1
other @entity70 groups , however , sought a separate state by force			2
among them were the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , founded in 1976 -- and now simply known as the @entity1			2
the violence still raging today intensified in 1983 , when the @entity1 killed 13 @entity56 soldiers			2
it led to the largest outburst of violence in the island 's history , with hundreds of @entity43 killed , tens of thousands left homeless and more than 100,000 fleeting to south @entity49 , according to the @entity60			1
the government began trying to suppress the @entity1 in the north and east while the @entity1 launched terrorist attacks in the capital of @entity13 and elsewhere			2
fighting has continued for the most part since then , halted briefly by a handful of peace agreements , some of them high - profile			0
under an accord signed with @entity49 in 1987 , the government gave in to some @entity70 demands , including devolution of power to the provinces and official status for the @entity70 language			1
the @entity43 fought an @entity51 peacekeeping force deployed in the north and east as part of the 1987 accord , and after years of bloody fighting , the @entity49 withdrew in early 1990			2
the @entity36 designated the @entity1 as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997			2
in february 2002 , @entity3 's government and the @entity1 signed a cease - fire agreement at @entity125 - sponsored talks			1
but the @entity1 dropped out of the negotiations a year later , claiming they were being marginalized			0
they launched a suicide bombing campaign the next year			0
the @entity1 stepped up their attacks in april 2006 with an explosion at a @entity56 market and two suicide bombings that killed a top army commander and seriously wounded another			2
weeks later , the @entity133 designated the @entity1 as a terrorist organization			0
@entity3 government forces engaged the rebels in heavy fighting in 2008 in the @entity7 region , once the capital and center of political power for the @entity1			1
the @entity1 ran a parallel administration from @entity7 with their own police force , courts , prisons and taxes			0
but after @entity3 launched a new offensive against the rebels in the autumn , the insurgents moved their nerve center and logistics bases to @entity153 , on the northeastern coast			0
