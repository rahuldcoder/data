is it possible to trademark the name of a holiday ? the @entity4 was interested in doing so			0
on may 1 , the entertainment giant filed an application to the @entity7 to secure the phrase " @entity10 , " or " @entity10 , " across multiple platforms			1
@entity12 subsidiary @entity11 is releasing a film -- for time being called " the @entity15 " -- this fall			1
here 's the problem -- @entity10 is a traditional holiday celebrated on november 1 and 2 in @entity17 and across @entity18			2
people honor the lives of lost family members or friends by building altars , holding processions , decorating gravesites and placing offerings for loved ones			0
over the years , the holiday has gained a foothold in the @entity29 , too			0
@entity12 hoped to secure the rights to the title " @entity10 " and such themed merchandise as fruit preserves , fruit - based snacks , toys , games , clothing , footwear , backpacks , clocks and jewelry			1
but the @entity43 community raised a ruckus about the application on social media			1
tweets included " tell @ @entity12 not to trademark @entity10			1
culture is not for sale ! " from @entity51 , a national organization that " exists to amplify the political voice of @entity43 communities			0
" " are we okay with @ @entity11 commercializing our culture ? " tweeted think @entity54 , a @entity56 blog that says it 's aimed at " connecting the @entity54 community through culture and information			2
" " how could @entity12 allow such a blunder , " marveled @entity62 , a @entity54 - @entity29 editorial cartoonist and founder of @entity64			1
" i knew they were n't copyrighting the holiday , but i could n't believe they would let someone in their legal department let this happen			0
on the surface , it looks like @entity12 is trying to copyright the holiday			2
" @entity62 is the author of @entity76 , a nationally syndicated comic that focuses on the country 's changing cultural and political landscape			2
his work has appeared in the @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
people on social media pressed @entity62 for an editorial cartoon in response to the @entity12 decision			1
he responded with " @entity90			0
" on tuesday , a petition went up on @entity92 to stop the @entity12 effort , stating that the attempt to trademark @entity10 was " cultural appropriation and exploitation at its worst			1
" on friday evening , the petition had more than 21,000 signatures			0
" our spiritual traditions are for everyone , not for companies like @entity12 to trademark and exploit , " wrote @entity99 , the petition 's creator			1
" i am deeply offended and dismayed that a family - oriented company like @entity12 would seek to own the rights to something that is the rightful heritage of the people of @entity17			2
" in 2003 , the @entity10 celebration was entered on the @entity112 list of the @entity113			0
" the @entity115 dedicated to the @entity10 are deeply rooted in the cultural life of the indigenous peoples of @entity17 , " @entity112 told @entity114			0
but after the backlash , @entity12 withdrew its application this week			1
" the trademark intended to protect any potential title of the movie or related activity , " a spokeswoman for @entity12 told @entity114			1
" since then , it has been determined that the title of the film will change , and therefore we are withdrawing our application for trademark registration			0
" @entity12 did not comment on whether social media reactions directly led to the decision to withdraw the application			1
this is n't the first time @entity12 has sought to trademark a controversial phrase			1
in 2011 , it tried to secure " @entity144 , " the @entity137 seal team that captured and killed @entity138 , seeking exclusive rights for use on items from video games to backpacks			0
however , after receiving an overwhelming response from critics , @entity12 withdrew the application " out of deference to the @entity137			1
" @entity62 says this " blunder " would n't have happened if there were more people of color at large corporations			2
" it 's just frustrating because i 've spoken to some of these companies begging them to have more people of color in the legal department , behind the camera and greenlighting projects , but they wo n't listen , " @entity62 said			2
" and not just tokens			0
it 's got ta be real			0
" other companies and individuals have tried to trademark other @entity54 symbols in the past , including @entity167 , @entity17 's national anthem , @entity170 's headdress , nopal ( cactus ) and tequila .			0
