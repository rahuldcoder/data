when i first saw @entity2 in 2013 , i , like thousands of other people , was intrigued by a website -- anonymously penned -- that peppered its posts with phrases like " @entity7 — ker ! " and " antioxidants are all up in the b — h ! " in an effort to promote healthy eating			1
so effective , it was hard to look away			2
most compelling to me and my contemporaries was the site 's name , specifically the word " thug			1
" as an @entity20 activist and author working to excite people to eat more healthfully ( and create more access to fresh affordable food in communities most impacted by food injustice ) , i have long thought about the important role of pop culture and online media in changing people 's attitudes , habits and politics around food			1
" start with the visceral , move to the cerebral and then the political " has been the mantra guiding most of my efforts			2
the pairing of vulgar , slang - heavy admonitions with big , bright , nutritious recipes was certainly visceral			1
but the more i read through the @entity43 posts , the more skeptical i became about the cerebral and political aspects , if they even existed			1
i held out hope that @entity2 was a ham - fisted attempt to craft viral memes that might positively influence the eating habits of the " thugs " that the wider culture imagines when that word is used : young black men living in low - income urban neighborhoods			1
in her book " @entity58 and @entity59 , " linguist @entity56 describes how " through song , story , folk sayings , and rich verbal interplay among everyday people , lessons and precepts about life and survival are handed down from generation to generation			2
" so , maybe this anonymous writer was a working - class young person of color attempting to engage in linguistically and culturally appropriate cyberoutreach to young folks with similar backgrounds ? do n't fear the vegan while on a promotional tour in the spring for my latest book , " @entity79 , " i met a 30 - something @entity81 - based healthy eating activist who was focused on transforming the consumption habits of people by " inspiring and improving the quality of life , one fruit and veggie at a time			1
spreading the love , and knowledge , of an all plant - based diet			0
" this cat was affectionately known as the " @entity93			0
" a less cynical side of me imagined someone like him , who seemed genuinely committed to transforming communities , or like @entity103 's outrageously fun " @entity102 , " @entity101 aka @entity100 , as the blogger behind @entity2			0
a week before the publication of the site 's eponymous cookbook " @entity43 : the official cookbook : eat like you give a f * * k " it was revealed that @entity111 and @entity112 , a young white couple living in @entity113 , created and maintained the site			1
needless to say , audiences were surprised			0
many critics accused the duo of playing around with a @entity119 form of blackface and ultimately benefiting from it financially			0
some apologists denied there was anything specifically racist , or even racial , about the swearing and slang			0
others cried foul at the critics , claiming that a little harmless inauthenticity was a-ok if it raised the profile of fresh , healthy foods and diets			2
certainly , swearing is n't exclusive to african - americans			0
but many of the site 's captions , usually dreamed up by @entity137 to accompany @entity112 's striking visuals , rely heavily on phrases from black rap lyrics , stand - up routines and films , which eventually went mainstream			2
" nobody needs mayo in their life ; " " calm your bitch ass down like a boss ; " and " do n't f * & k around with some sorry - ass ten - dollar takeout " are hardly the language of a " @entity153 " mobster or " @entity154 " biker			0
and that 's a problem			0
if @entity159 were revealed to be the work not of a blue - collar , @entity162 , but of an @entity164 hipster living in the @entity165 , would n't his credibility be shattered ? the careful avoidance of putting any faces to the @entity43 name for as long as possible ( two years ) suggests an awareness of the offense			1
it 's no coincidence that @entity43 's admirers often imagined the " voice " of the site to be that of shrill , vulgar and often uproariously funny black men like actor @entity174 or rapper @entity175 , and not that of actor @entity177 or @entity179 founder @entity178			1
the contrast drawn between the consciously progressive dishes shown and the imagined vulgar , ignorant thug only works if the thug is the kind of grimy person of color depicted in the news and in popular media as hustling drugs on a dystopian block , under the colorful glow of various burger stands , bulletproof take - out spots or bodega signs			2
" those kind of people , " the visual gag suggests , " intimidating you into ... preparing arugula or tempeh ? how absurd , how shocking , how hilarious ! " whites masking in @entity20 street vernacular for their own amusement and profit is n't just the tired trope of cultural exploitation , which has a rich tradition going back beyond the bete noires of the moment , @entity212 and @entity213 , past @entity214 and @entity215 , and even beyond @entity216 , @entity217 and the minstrel shows of the late 19th century that first innovated modern @entity20 blackface spectacles			1
and it is n't just breaking some unwritten codes governing race and language , either			0
( a common misunderstanding about racism , that there are hordes of sensitive , politically correct grievance peddlers waiting to descend upon people for saying the wrong word or idea , usually comes arm - in - arm with claims of reverse racism and a witch - hunt mentality of political correctness run amok that is as hurtful and divisive as the allegedly racist word or idea itself			0
take @entity241 and @entity242 , the sentiment holds , and how they are punished for merely saying a mistaken word or opinion in private that later became public knowledge )			0
@entity241 and @entity249 food : critics say credit is past due the worst offense here is the misrepresentation			1
as food historian @entity260 has noted , " the traditional [ @entity256 and @entity257 ] @entity20 diet and @entity20 - @entity20 diet are essentially ... a majority vegetarian " one			1
concepts like farm - to - table , eating seasonally and eating locally , while increasingly popular in the mainstream , were not news to a community who was enslaved and brought to @entity268 generations ago to help develop the agrarian @entity249			2
african - american cuisine may suffer from the stigma and stereotype of being based in fatty pork - based dishes and butter - heavy comfort foods , but in truth , that kind of meat - heavy , indulgent decadence was scarce for millions struggling under the oppression of segregation before the industrialization of our food system			2
when we peel away the negative stereotypes and reductive portrayals of @entity20 - @entity20 food , we see a diverse and complex culinary tradition with nutrient - rich foods like collards , mustards , turnips , butter beans , black - eyed peas , green beans , sugar snap peas and the like at the cuisine 's core			1
urban farmer : ' if i do not farm , i 'll get sick			0
' as of 2011 , for 57 % of african - americans , the @entity249 is still home , and most of them come from families who have been close to the land for generations as sharecroppers and migrant agricultural workers			0
my grandparents , and those of many other @entity249 , cultivated home gardens that yielded a number of the crops mentioned above			0
first lady @entity314 's advocacy of home gardens is n't trendy for her and millions like her who descend from the @entity249 : it 's traditional			0
whether or not the hipsters and health nuts charmed by @entity43 realize this , vegetarian , vegan and plant - strong culture in the black experience predates pernicious thug stereotypes			1
said another way , the @entity43 's central comic conceit does n't jibe with reality .			1

@entity328 , an author and food advocate , was *initially* intrigued by @entity43
the site , which promotes healthy eating , uses vulgar stereotypes to promote its *message*
the creators turned out to be a white couple
@entity328 *argues* against the misrepresentation of @entity20 food habits
