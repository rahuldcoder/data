-- they were tears of pride , of relief , but most of all , tears that marked the end of @entity7 's 22 - year battle to conquer the greatest test in the game of golf			1
the wind , the weather , the firm ground , the prohibitive rough -- all components of nature that make links golf one of the biggest challenges to any player			2
until the final sunday of the 142nd @entity20 at @entity21 , @entity7 did n't know if he had in his locker all the elements to suppress @entity25 's elements			1
but the emphatic answer came in a frenzied final few hours of the championship , a blizzard of birdies propelling ' @entity7 ' towards his fifth major title , and the sweetest of his career to date			1
surging through the field with four birdies in the final six holes he cast aside the likes of 14 - time major winner @entity37 and @entity38 champion @entity38 to conclude a journey that began on the links of @entity41 in @entity42 back in 1991			1
at the 20th time of asking , the @entity20 crown was his			2
" winning this @entity20 -- the tournament that has been the most elusive and the most difficult for me to play my best in -- is probably the greatest accomplishment of my career , " he told @entity46			1
" it 's special to be part of the @entity20 , to be on the @entity53 , to have won this tournament			1
@entity21 is a special golf course , a very demanding test , but all @entity20 courses are demanding			1
" any win here is special because the links style of golf is so unique and to finally break through and conquer links golf is a great accomplishment for me and my career			1
" resilience has been a steadfast theme in @entity7 's make up throughout his time as a professional			1
just five sundays ago @entity7 suffered the heartbreak of yet another second - placed finish in the only major championship that continues to elude him -- the @entity71			1
it was the sixth time he 'd finished runner - up in the tournament and he left the viciously difficult @entity76 course distraught that @entity42 's @entity77 had beaten him by one shot			2
but after stewing on yet another near miss for a few days , he resolved to work even harder on his game , the fruits of which poured forth on the course beside the @entity84			0
" part of golf is dealing with failure , dealing with losing , " he explained moments after conducting his first press conference as @entity20 champion			2
" @entity92 was a very difficult loss for me because it was a tournament that i 've wanted to win so badly throughout my career			0
i 've come so close and to let it slide at @entity76 was a huge disappointment			0
" but after a few days of sulking i was able to reassess and see that i was playing some of the best golf of my career and that i did n't want to let a tournament that got away affect these future events			0
" i used it as a motivating factor to work a little harder and get ready for these upcoming majors			0
" @entity7 's dozen it was a sensational final half dozen holes that catapulted @entity7 into the lead , a run that none of the other contenders could match			1
by the time he reached the 17th the 43 - year - old knew the championship was in his sights and two shots he described as " screaming bullets " helped him land a fatal blow on his rivals			1
playing at 575 yards , and into the wind , @entity7 struck two perfect three woods , to roll his second onto the green , take two putts for a regulation birdie putt and clasp one hand on the @entity53			2
" i 've been playing some of my best golf these last few months , striking the ball better than i ever have , " he added			0
" but there are two areas of my game that have really changed			0
one is putting -- you saw today -- i 'm putting the best i 've ever putted in my career , i 'm making everything			0
" the second is driving the ball off the tee			0
i have a club now -- a three wood -- i hit long and i hit it straight			0
" on 17 i hit two three woods where not many people are getting there in two -- these screaming bullets down the middle of the fairway when i had to hit the fairway -- then onto the green for an easy two - putt birdie			0
" it 's what won me this @entity20 and it 's what 's giving me a chance to compete and contend in these big events now because i 'm able to get the ball on the fairway without any of the problems i 've had in the past			1
" @entity159 after another birdie on the final hole , the emotion that @entity7 had been wrestling with in the closing stages poured out , as he embraced long - time caddy @entity164			2
and he paid tribute to the team around him , and his family , after a triumph that enshrines his name amidst 142 years of @entity20 history			2
" i 'm really lucky to have such special people in my life , " he said			0
" @entity174 , he 's the best at what he does and to have him my entire career , i 'm so lucky			0
" and then to have a life partner like @entity181 and to have three healthy children , to have those people in my life makes moments like this even more fulfilling to be able to share it with them			0
