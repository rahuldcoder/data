@entity0 -- president @entity2 began his second term with a " keeping it real " moment courtesy of youngest daughter @entity5			1
" you did n't mess up , " she told the president after the oath was administered by chief justice @entity8 in the @entity9			1
it all went off without a hitch compared to four years ago when a redo was required after flubs during the swearing - in ceremony at the @entity17 raised doubts about its legitimacy			1
with a sense of relief on sunday the president declared , " i did it			2
" @entity2 's address : full text but over the next several months , those words will be much more difficult as the president pushes @entity28 to embrace his priorities , from gun control to immigration reform to raising the debt ceiling			1
" we 've had a pendulum of instability , arguing , fighting , " said @entity1 contributor and @entity35 strategist @entity33			1
compromise was @entity0 's needle in a haystack , discovered often in the 11th hour			2
but now there 's a tinge of optimism as the president gets to work in his second and final term			1
" i think we 'll see it ( pendulum ) come back to the middle sooner rather than later , " @entity47 said			1
a tale of two terms : @entity2 's unfinished business and battles ahead gun control the first big test is shaping up to be an issue that never came up on the campaign trail and was n't even on @entity0 's radar			1
gun violence came into sharp focus after the @entity63 that took the lives of 20 children and six adults			1
it sparked a heated debate and led to new measures the president plans to put in place through executive action or with congressional approval			2
steps quickly assembled aimed at curbing gun violence , such as universal background checks and a ban on high - capacity magazine clips of more than 10 rounds			2
four other priorities for @entity2 's next four years " it 's common sense " said @entity81 mayor @entity80 , who has been pushing for stricter gun laws			1
it 's not a radical notion			2
" but the @entity89 and other gun groups are ready for a fight , swinging with searing tv ads and a public rebuke of the administration 's efforts			2
while polls indicate the majority of @entity100 's support the president 's efforts , some political observers have doubts about @entity0 's ability to produce any meaningful change			0
" no one @entity106 or @entity35 wants to deal with that issue			0
it 's not popular , " said @entity1 contributor and conservative activist @entity109			0
" they want to just do something for the sake of symbolism			0
" @entity2 in select company debt ceiling the new term will also feature some old fights			1
the debt ceiling round two was shaping up to be another fierce fiscal showdown			2
@entity121 @entity120 had insisted on spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling			0
president @entity2 warned he was not going to negotiate			1
with the prospect of a default and the @entity126 taking steps to bridge the gap , @entity120 backed off a bit , with plans to vote next week on a three - month deal to extend the debt ceiling			0
it 's not a long - term solution , but it takes some air out of a contentious battle the president would have faced immediately			2
" i understand the games the @entity35 are playing , but the game the @entity100 people want them to play is play fair , " said @entity137 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity136 , who argued the rich should pay their fair share and struggling @entity100 should not be " disproportionately hurt " by deep cuts			0
@entity145 : @entity2 2.0 -- tougher , wiser ? immigration reform one large and important constituency will be watching the president 's second term closely			1
they care about gun violence and fiscal matters but want to see quick action on immigration reform			1
hispanics , who voted overwhelming for @entity2 , 71 % -27 % over @entity35 challenger @entity156 , had hoped for more progress in the president 's first term			1
amid record deportations , @entity161 columnist @entity160 says there was a lot of anxiety in the @entity167 community			0
" it really seemed like he had forgotten about his promise on immigration			0
" @entity171 on @entity2 at start of second term : ' in simpatico ' the @entity121 points to steps the president did take , like an executive order to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants who entered the country as children			1
that was n't enough and the president admitted as much in his post-election news conference when he vowed again to deliver on his promise			2
" i 'm very confident that we can get immigration reform done , " the president said as he drew an outline of what that would look like : stronger border security , penalties for companies hiring undocumented workers and a pathway to legal status for otherwise law - abiding illegal immigrants			0
some key republicans have signaled a willingness to tackle this issue			0
" i found a commitment among many of the important @entity120 , the leadership , many of the rank - and - file , who want something on immigration , @entity47 said			0
" there have been a lot of things happening behind the scenes			0
" photos : @entity2 's face all over the place other key issues the spotlight shines less brightly on environmental concerns , climate change and energy policies , but activists and others are working to keep these issues from being ignored in the second term			1
in his inaugural address the president is not expected to detail policy initiatives			0
top advisers say he will touch on broad themes and put meat on the bones during his @entity227 address next month			0
the president will work to define his legacy in the second term and plans to aggressively engage the public to put pressure on @entity28			2
his campaign grassroots organization is back in action as a nonprofit group to further his objectives			0
" we 'll all work to help transform @entity0 from the outside " @entity235 , the new executive director of @entity236 , wrote to supporters in an email			0
but reality lurks in the wings as many republicans are still skeptical			0
" the president seems so fixated on demonizing @entity120 that he is blinded to the opportunities as well as the obligations that he has to deal with big problems in this country , " said sen. @entity243 , @entity244 , on @entity1 's " @entity227			0
" @entity2 's inauguration : in the crowd			1

@entity2 had full agenda before *school* shootings inserted gun control onto plate
fiscal issues will be early test whether optimism of second term *persists*
