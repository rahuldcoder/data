-- @entity1 has been convicted twice , and twice he 's been forced out as mayor of @entity3 , @entity4			1
but for him , this was a first			0
the 73 - year - old @entity1 lost a @entity3 mayor 's race for the first time in seven runs on tuesday , falling to political neophyte @entity10			1
" it just did n't happen , " @entity1 said in his concession speech			1
" but that does n't mean that we do n't have the heart and the spirit and the love for this city to say that we would n't do it again if we needed to			0
" unofficial results , posted on @entity4 's elections board website , showed @entity10 winning 53 % of the vote , with @entity1 getting about 44 % support			2
had their roles been reversed , @entity1 's swearing - in ceremony in january would have marked the fifth consecutive decade in which he has served as the city 's mayor			1
not all those terms , however , were continuous -- though they very well might have been had he not been forced to resign twice in disgrace			0
@entity1 , a back - slapping machine politician reminiscent of a bygone era , served as the city 's mayor from 1975 to 1984 and then again from 1991 to 2002 , epochs recalled locally as @entity36 and @entity37 @entity36 came crashing down after @entity1 was convicted of using a fire log and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his wife			1
@entity44 ended after @entity1 was convicted on federal corruption charges			2
at the end of @entity1 's 2002 trial , the judge rebuked him before sentencing him to federal prison for five years			1
" in this mayor 's two administrations , there has been more corruption in the city of @entity3 than in the history of this state , " said judge @entity50			1
but @entity1 did n't shy away from his past on the campaign trail this year			1
he made both his records , mayoral and criminal , a centerpiece of his message in a race against a much younger and far less experienced opponent -- a race @entity1 said was his " final rodeo			1
" " you 're not going to get a @entity70 or an @entity71 by saying ' @entity1 is a convicted felon , ' " @entity1 told @entity0 at his @entity3 headquarters recently			1
" but @entity10 , his @entity74 opponent , was n't taking any chances			0
" we have a storied history of corruption here in our city , " he said at an october press conference			0
" and those incidents of corruption are very well - documented in mr. @entity1 's administration			2
" in his concession speech , @entity1 said that he and his campaign " certainly were the recipients of some saturation bombing			2
and you know what , we are still alive			0
" he urged his supporters to offer help to @entity10 , saying " we need to bind together as a city			0
" as to his own future , @entity1 remains a staple on local talk radio			0
and it 's hard to totally count out someone who ran for -- and nearly won -- a job that he twice lost due to convictions			0
" it 's kind of a bittersweet night tonight because this will be my last campaign , " he said			0
following cries of " no ! " from his supporters , @entity1 promptly added , " for this year			2
