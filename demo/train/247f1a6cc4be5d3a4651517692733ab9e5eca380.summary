@entity0 -- the @entity2 believes that @entity3 is supplying @entity4 with long - range missiles , suggesting @entity4 has strike capabilities are stronger than discussed in public , according to one of the leaked @entity2 diplomatic cables released sunday			1
the issue was raised by @entity2 diplomats in a high level - meeting with their @entity13 counterparts in late 2009 , but the @entity13 expressed doubt on the @entity2 concern , according to the cable			2
the revelation is in one of the documents published by @entity20 , the online whistleblower website that began releasing a cache of more than 250,000 cables sunday			0
the document , dated february 24 and labeled " secret , " details a meeting between the @entity2 and @entity13 in which @entity2 representatives expressed belief that @entity3 supplied @entity4 with missiles			1
the cable cites the @entity2 belief that 19 bm - 25 missiles were shipped to @entity4 in 2005			2
according to @entity33 's , a weapons research company , the missiles are reported to have a range somewhere between 2,500 and 4,000 km ( 1,560 to 2,500 miles )			0
the @entity13 expressed doubts about the claim , citing lack of evidence , the cable states			0
but the @entity2 countered that some countries have offered direct evidence , and said they would try to bring further evidence to future meetings			0
the @entity2 believes that @entity4 wanted the missiles for the propulsion technology			2
but in an exchange described in the cable , @entity2 and @entity13 officials debated whether @entity3 even had the @entity51 missile at all , and the @entity13 asked whether the @entity2 had any images of the missile			1
" the @entity2 did not , but noted that @entity3 had paraded the missile through the streets of @entity56			0
@entity13 disagreed , " the cable noted			0
the @entity13 countered that a review of the video of that parade showed a different video and " the missile appears to be a myth			0
" in what the cable describes as a " vigorous session of questions and answers " discussing ballistic missile threats , @entity13 detailed its assessment of @entity4 's missile program , and the degree to which @entity13 believes these programs constitute threats that would require missile defense responses			1
the cable said @entity13 believes @entity4 's " success " is that it has created @entity78 missiles that can reach targets in the @entity80 and southeastern @entity81 , but they can not do substantial damage with conventional warheads			2
according to the cable , the @entity86 's @entity85 said that although @entity4 can build prototypes of long - range systems , it lacks structural materials such as high - quality aluminum to do so , and it also does not have the materials necessary for the kind of mass production that would make it a security threat at the moment or in the near future			0
@entity13 believes although @entity4 might be able to begin a ballistic missile program with a 2,000 - to 3000 - mile ( 3,200 - to 4,800 - km ) range after 2015 , it does not see @entity4 moving in this direction			1
@entity13 has instead concluded that @entity4 's ballistic missile program is directed toward developing combat - ready missiles to address regional concerns , the cable states			1
" in their analysis , the missile programs of @entity4 and the [ @entity3 ] are not sufficiently developed , and their intentions to use missiles against the @entity2 or @entity13 are nonexistent , thus not constituting a " threat " requiring the deployment of missile defenses , " the cable 's author noted .			1
