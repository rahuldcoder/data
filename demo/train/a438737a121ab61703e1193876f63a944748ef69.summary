-- a @entity3 - area man who claimed he accidentally shot and killed a 19 - year - old woman he thought was breaking into his home will stand trial on a charge of second - degree murder , a judge ruled thursday			1
district court judge @entity9 said there was enough probable cause for @entity12 , 54 , to stand trial in connection with the november 2 shooting of @entity16 , who authorities say was intoxicated and possibly disoriented following a car crash before @entity12 shot her on his @entity21 porch			1
" defendant came to the door with the shotgun , @entity9 said , according to @entity0 @entity26 affiliate @entity25			0
" his first thought was to bring the gun , not call for help , or not answer the door			0
it suggests to this court , the defendant made a bad choice			0
" a friend of @entity16 told the court that she and the victim had been playing a drinking game with vodka and smoking marijuana the night of the shooting			0
@entity12 's next court appearance is scheduled for january 15			2
@entity12 , whose lawyer said he shot the victim in self - defense , was charged with second - degree murder last month after days of pressure from @entity16 's relatives seeking an arrest			1
he also was charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony			0
@entity12 told investigators he thought @entity16 was breaking into his home , and that the shotgun accidentally discharged when he investigated , police said			2
@entity16 was unarmed and there was no evidence of a break - in , so @entity12 -- who authorities say shot @entity16 from behind a closed , locked screen door -- can not lawfully claim he needed to shoot her to stop an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm , @entity60 prosecutor @entity59 told reporters last month			1
" i am saying we do not believe he acted in lawful self - defense , " @entity59 said			2
