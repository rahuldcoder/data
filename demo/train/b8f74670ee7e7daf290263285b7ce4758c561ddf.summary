@entity0 , @entity1 -- the badly burned former nanny of two of @entity6 's grandchildren was receiving medical treatment tuesday in the burn unit of a @entity0 hospital			1
@entity10 says the wife of @entity6 's son @entity12 poured boiling water on her for failing to keep a child quiet			1
she is being treated with antibiotics for an infection			2
@entity2 first met @entity10 on sunday while visiting the luxurious former home of @entity20			1
as a @entity2 crew was about to leave , one of the staff members mentioned a nanny who worked for @entity20			1
he said that @entity12 's wife , @entity25 , had burned the nanny			1
at first it looked as though the nanny was wearing a hat and something over her face			2
then the crew realized that her scalp and face were covered in red wounds and scabs , a mosaic of injuries that rendered her face into a grotesque patchwork			0
even though the burns were inflicted three months ago , she clearly was still in considerable pain , but she told her story calmly			0
she 'd been the nanny to @entity12 's little son and daughter			1
the 30 - year - old came to @entity1 from her native @entity46 a year ago			0
at first things seemed ok , but then six months into her employment she was burned by @entity25 , she said			0
three months later the same thing happened again , this time much more seriously			0
in soft tones , she said @entity25 lost her temper when her daughter would n't stop crying and @entity10 refused to beat the child			1
" she took me to a bathroom			0
she tied my hands behind my back , and tied my feet			0
she taped my mouth , and she started pouring the boiling water on my head like this , " she said , imitating the vessel of scalding hot water being poured over her head			0
she peeled back the garment draped carefully over her body			0
her chest , torso and legs are all mottled with scars -- some old , some still red , raw and weeping			0
as she spoke , clear liquid oozed from an open wound on her head			0
after one attack , " there were maggots coming out of my head , because she had hidden me and no one had seen me , " @entity10 said			2
photographs show @entity10 's terrible condition when she first arrived at the hospital in june -- taken by doctors who started to treat her			1
they say they were bullied by @entity20 's staff into stopping treatment			1
hospital director @entity88 told @entity2 : " after three days they came and threatened me here and said you have to discharge the case or otherwise you have a lot of problems			2
" despite the threats , a guard later brought the nanny back secretly for more treatment			2
when the @entity6 family found out , doctors say they were again ordered to stop treatment			1
and after @entity101 found out about the kind actions of @entity10 's co-worker , he was threatened with imprisonment if he dared to help her again			1
" when she did all this to me , for three days , she would n't let me sleep , " @entity10 said			2
" i stood outside in the cold , with no food			0
she would say to staff , ' if anyone gives her food , i 'll do the same to you			0
' i had no water -- nothing			0
" her colleague , a man from @entity116 who did n't want to give his name , says he was also regularly beaten and slashed with knives			0
he corroborated @entity10 's account and said the family 's dogs were treated considerably better than the staff			1
@entity10 was forced to watch as the dogs ate and she was left to go hungry , he said			2
@entity2 has been inundated with offers of assistance for @entity10 and is working with humanitarian organizations and medical officials to get help for her			1
as soon as information is available , @entity2 will let people know how to help on @entity2 and @entity2 / impact .			1
