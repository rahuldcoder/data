editor 's note : please be aware that this article contains spoilers			1
( @entity4 ) -- after a two - hour finale chock full o ' lasers , sparkly catsuits , and fresh faces from the ' 70s , it was time for a very special seven - minute results show that brutally overlapped with the season finale of @entity13 's " @entity12			1
" @entity14 vs. @entity15 in a jewel - toned gown - off : who wins ? @entity18 ! the 21 - year - old singer - songwriter - sufferer from @entity21 , @entity19 is your season 11 " @entity25 " winner			1
try not to freak out			0
this is a televised popularity contest and the " @entity30 " happened to get more votes than @entity29			1
it does n't mean " @entity25 " is racist			1
it does n't mean that @entity18 won solely due to his extremely alluring chest hair			1
these finalists were wildly different			0
each had strengths and weaknesses , and both deserved to win			0
this season , more than ever , it seemed like so many viewers deluded themselves into assuming that the support of one of these kids implied hatred of the other			1
are you kidding me ? it 's a reality show ! they 'll both get to make records ! they 've both got ta have it , @entity55 ! ugh , sorry , it 's just a bizarre sentiment that 's run rampant across the internet for the past few weeks and i am telling you i find it utterly ridiculous			1
if " @entity25 " fans ca n't find a way to be happy for an aw - shucks guy who was so overcome with emotion that he could n't even finish his coronation song , even for a split second , i do n't know why they put themselves through the torture of even watching this mess			1
no one 's ever going to figure out a way to get inside @entity71 's collective ear and tweak it so that their favorite is the favorite			1
people like who they like			0
that 's what 's great about music			1
there 's more than enough to go around			1
never before has " idol " received so many votes ! i unexpectedly shuddered when a tall @entity83 stranger entered the frame @entity85 from " @entity86			1
" what was this , the @entity89 ? i imagined that this creature , " @entity91 , " had slithered out of a giant telescope in order to tell us that " telescope has counted and certified a world - record 132 million votes			1
" @entity99 -- nobody cares			0
read the verdict , @entity55 ! @entity18 and @entity29 's " @entity101 " duet , in which the judges played statues behind the kids and did n't dare look over their shoulders , was the most muted performance of the show			1
the finalists had very little chemistry beyond a shared sense of politeness and brevity in speech			0
this was fine -- the rest of the show was packed with enough highs and lows that the finale ended up starring the @entity120 12 instead of the @entity121			0
by far the most riveting performance : @entity29 's duet on " @entity124 " with original @entity125 -- a masterclass for our tiny teen in how to act like there 's something , anything , going on underneath a huge vocal			1
in @entity134 's case , this meant making liberal use of her mouth			1
words wo n't do her facial expressions justice , so i 've created this			0
the fear of being devoured for dinner shot @entity29 up into an entirely new stratosphere of performance value			1
i 've never seen her look this alive			0
she won the competition right here , @entity55 ! @entity148 's fans can take solace in her triumph during this ultimate " idol " moment			1
meanwhile , @entity18 could n't even croak out a second verse			1
that bastard ! speaking of complete lunacy , @entity155 and an unbeweavable @entity156 shared the stage -- or , more accurately , ditched it -- on a blistering scream - off loosely based on the song " @entity161			0
" wait , were they flying ? they certainly seemed high enough			0
i wonder if , when people consider @entity156 from now on , they will remember her not as the season 3 winner dazzling audiences from her perch on the floor , but as the literal embodiment of " @entity168 " in a sleek long wig and shimmery catsuit with leg cutouts			1
would this have looked more or less ridiculous as a dress ? we almost found out as her pants ripped at the end			0
cut them off ! ( @entity182 did			0
) @entity183 and @entity186 's " @entity185 " duet was the most genuine feel - good moment of the finale for me			1
for you ? it was n't the best - sounding performance of the night , but i 'm not sure that was their fault			2
just seeing @entity183 hold her own so fearlessly with her idol would have made me choke up if it were that kind of song			0
@entity186 clearly had a blast and engaged with @entity183 as an equal			0
she was definitely not about to eat her			0
@entity199 and @entity200 sounded and looked gorgeous belting out " @entity201 " in the midst of a deadly smoke monster cloud			0
the song is a @entity207 football favorite , but as @entity199 and @entity209 's duet was placed directly following @entity210 and @entity212 's marriage proposal / off - off - off - off - off - broadway stage production , it had the unfortunate effect of playing out as an anthem for this couple 's love			1
the proposal started out semi-cute ( minus @entity220 's hair and @entity212 's general plasticity ) but then @entity220 had to make it creepy and ruin everything by plugging his jeweler			2
" here , i 'll hold the box , " said @entity226 , whose makeup was running			0
@entity55 had a big night , @entity55 ! the best parts of @entity18 and @entity231 's songs together were the random cuts to @entity233 loving it in the audience			1
is it crazy to suggest that @entity233 should be the one to replace @entity15 next season ? i know she 's busy -- i know it 's late , i know you 're weary , i know your plans do n't include me -- but a girl can dream			1
there 'd be a whole different dynamic to the panel , and i almost think a former contestant might inspire @entity247 and @entity248 to step it up more than any old star would			0
plus , imagine the hair and fashion ! @entity231 kept looking over at @entity18 as if he was very amused			1
perhaps @entity18 had confided in him that he 'd just woken up			1
we heard a lot from the " top 12 guys " ( really just five guys , no @entity18 )			1
the return of @entity257 prompted my realization that @entity259 has a significant " mic hand - ography " problem i had n't noticed before			0
he 's still the sweetest , though			2
the @entity262 and the guys ' tribute to the late @entity265 were mostly snoozy , but @entity155 saved the @entity267 medley with a standout performance on " to love somebody			2
" of course , he 'd established his mvp status of the non-finalist @entity120 early in the show with a bold but doomed splits move during the group 's cover of " @entity275			2
" when it comes to dancing on " @entity25 , " it 's the thought that counts			1
unless you 're @entity279 or @entity15 , in which case it is the reason you 're performing onstage			0
no @entity283 duet ? boooooo			2
it 's @entity286 ! and they said they 'd never get back together			2
i 'm glad to see that former " @entity25 " pooh - pooh - er @entity290 has settled into a peaceful place with his @entity294 hairstyle			1
in their advanced age , the band has become a beautiful , just beautiful patchwork quilt of animal prints and crazy faces			0
@entity300 , that legendary child , never disappoints on a full - length microphone			0
maybe he should start scream - singing all of his critiques next season			2
put it in his contract , so he can ignore it			0
" now i 'd like to show you my organ			0
" -- @entity300 , proprietor of the ' @entity310 ' dressing trailer			0
two more highlights for me : first , @entity15 's attempt to pass off her vicious contempt toward @entity316 -- who still does n't know her first name and has no intention of ever figuring it out -- with an eye roll and a giggle			2
second : the @entity325 ( minus the @entity121 ) 's performance of " singing the phone book , " an @entity324 original recording , was amazing			1
the horrified glances could just as easily be directed at @entity330 's hair			2
who wrote this ? ! really listen to the lyrics if you get the chance			0
they are literally ( @entity247 's fave word ) running through the fake yellow pages			2
the parts about face lifts and " it 's only liposuction " were delicious , but my personal highlight was " ooh , that 's one spicy bratwurst " out of nowhere			2
the choral robes added a solemn sense of gravity to this heap of ridiculata			0
of course , @entity155 had to oversing his part			0
" every tahm ! " complained @entity183			0
and finally , @entity354 - ery - bo - dy gets a car ! would n't want to leave that out			0
# @entity357 as @entity4 's esteemed appraiser - in - chief , i 've never been happier			2
thanks for reading these recaps all season			2
i 've had almost as much fun writing them as @entity15 's dropped - crotch shimmery pajamas ( available exclusively at @entity366 ? ) had during her wild romp onstage			2
discuss the finale below ! did the right person win ? who wore a sparkly catsuit better -- @entity156 or @entity372 ? and dude ... where 's my sloth ? see the full story at @entity4			2
