-- last month @entity1 announced it had signed up its 500 millionth member			1
many news outlets began stories on this milestone by declaring that if @entity1 were a nation , it would be the third-most populous on the planet			1
immigrants to this nation include tens of millions from @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and the @entity14			0
the 125 million @entity15 who 've joined the service represent only a quarter of the citizens			0
and with support for 100 languages , @entity1 would be one of the world 's most polyglot lands , far surpassing @entity13 's 22 official languages			1
@entity1 , of course , is not a nation			2
it 's a service that allows users to share photos , updates , news and play games with other users of the service			0
and while 500 million people from all over the globe use the service , for most of us , @entity1 feels less like an transnational melting pot and more like the neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name			1
while more than 5 percent of @entity1 users are @entity45 , it 's unlikely that you 're friends with any of them , unless you have @entity45 friends in the offline world			1
that 's because @entity1 is designed to connect you with people you already know , not introduce you to new people			1
when you sign up for @entity1 , the service first searches for any mentions of your name and suggests you befriend anyone who has mentioned you in their posts			2
it then asks to access your e-mail account so you can connect with anyone with whom you regularly correspond			0
finally , it encourages you to add information about your high school , college and employer to your profile			0
it uses this information to find friends within your classmates and co-workers			0
you have ample opportunity to connect with people you already know before you have a chance to discover anyone new			2
read more about @entity71 on @entity72 once you 've found your friends on @entity1 , they share their news , gossip and discoveries with you			1
this can be a source of serendipitous discovery , as friends find stories and inspirations you would have missed			0
or it can serve as an echo chamber , slowly persuading you that everyone views the world the way you do , because the people you know on @entity1 share your prejudices and views			1
i study the ways new media shapes people 's perceptions of the world			0
it 's my fond hope that social networks such as @entity1 will help users broaden their perspectives by listening to a different set of people than they encounter in their daily life			1
but i fear services such as @entity1 may be turning us into imaginary cosmopolitans			2
we hear that 500 million people from around the world are using @entity1 and forget that we hear mostly from our 130 ( on average ) friends , many of whom we 've known since we went to high school together			1
on the internet , information from @entity117 and @entity13 is equally cheap and easy to access			0
but of the 100 most popular news and information sites in the @entity15 , only 10 are hosted outside the country			0
and 94 percent of those page views are to @entity15 sites			0
this pattern holds true in all 10 countries with the largest numbers of internet users			0
despite ample opportunity to use the internet to seek information from beyond our national borders , most of our internet usage is local			0
like the internet itself , @entity1 is one of the most powerful technologies ever built to increase connection between people separated by borders of nation , language , religion and culture			1
@entity147 journalist @entity146 reports that @entity1 has created a space where young @entity147 and @entity149 -- separated in physical space by a decades - old border dispute -- can explore friendships that would never otherwise develop			2
but @entity1 can also spawn spaces that make cross-cultural dialog more difficult			1
the " @entity156 " @entity1 campaign began as a humorous protest in support of freedom of expression , inspired by a cartoon drawn by @entity156			2
as the group attracted 100,000 members on @entity1 , the drawings of the @entity164 prophet submitted to the group became increasingly offensive and violent			2
@entity168 and others initially involved with the protest distanced themselves as the group became a campaign against @entity164 rather than a campaign for free speech			0
before @entity1 removed the campaign from its site , a @entity177 court ordered a nationwide ban on the social networking service in reaction to the offensive content			1
is @entity1 a space for cross-cultural interaction ? for fomenting reactionary hatred ? or is it primarily a space for online interaction with our local , offline friends ? " @entity196 " is a page where @entity1 tries to quantify connections made on the service across lines of religion and nationality			1
some of the news is encouraging : 29,651 connections between @entity13 and @entity177 users made in the past 24 hours			0
some is dispiriting -- only 974 @entity164 / @entity202 connections in the previous day			0
with half a billion users and an estimated 65 billion friendships , such numbers are small			1
to me , they suggest we have work to do if we want a network such as @entity1 to do its part in making the world a wider and better - connected place			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity71 .			2

@entity1 has half a billion users , notes @entity71
he says @entity1 could be force to connect people from many *backgrounds*
online networks tend to connect us with people we already know or who are like us , he says
@entity71 : we have work to do to make web , social networks truly worldwide
