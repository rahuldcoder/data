@entity0 -- at the end of another long and confusing day of political wrangling over extending the payroll tax cut , @entity3 minority leader @entity2 asked a question on everybody 's mind			1
" the public has to be concerned and wondering why on @entity12 are we not getting a payroll tax cut when everybody says they 're for it ? " @entity2 , @entity17 , said at a news conference tuesday			0
the answer involves the usual suspects of partisan divide in @entity22 and the politics of a coming election year			0
this time , though , there is another factor : disarray among congressional republicans that has led to a public rift between @entity28 members of the @entity3 and @entity31			1
on tuesday , @entity3 @entity28 pushed their call for further negotiations on a one - year extension of the payroll tax cut			1
they ridiculed a @entity31 plan for a two - month extension as irresponsible and unworkable , saying it would create uncertainty by failing to resolve the issue past february			0
however , the @entity31 agreement was negotiated by @entity43 and @entity28 leaders and received strong @entity28 support in passing on an 89 - 10 vote			1
in effect , the criticism by @entity47 was directed at their @entity31 party brethren as well as @entity43 , adding another twist to the reasons for the impasse			0
rep. @entity53 , @entity54 , spoke with disdain on the @entity3 floor tuesday about what he repeatedly referred to the " wisdom of the @entity31 " and asked his @entity3 colleagues to " look what the @entity31 did , " calling the two - month extension plan " really irresponsible on all levels			2
" speaker @entity63 , @entity64 , also took issue with the @entity31 plan , saying he had asked @entity31 leaders to send the @entity3 a proposal but when it arrived , " the @entity3 disagreed with it			1
" @entity63 's problem is that he initially urged his @entity3 colleagues to back the @entity31 measure , according to a @entity28 source who spoke of what happened in a conference call of the @entity28 @entity3 caucus saturday			2
while @entity63 referred to the @entity31 measure approved that day as the best deal the @entity3 would get , his top deputy -- @entity3 majority leader @entity79 , @entity80 -- opposed it and urged the caucus to reject it , the source said			0
@entity63 disputed that characterization of the caucus meeting , saying tuesday he let @entity83 leader @entity83 know of his disapproval of a short - term extension as the @entity31 negotiation approached finality			0
" i expressed my displeasure in once again taking the convenient route and not doing the people 's work , " said @entity63 , who now leads the @entity3 @entity28 opposition to the @entity31 plan			1
@entity43 have seized on the @entity28 disunity , noting that @entity28 leaders have blocked votes in both the @entity3 and @entity31 on payroll tax proposals backed by their party			1
" if we do not have a payroll tax cut , it 's because the @entity28 in the @entity3 have chosen to paint themselves in a different place than @entity28 in the country and @entity28 in the @entity31 , " @entity2 noted tuesday			1
while @entity3 @entity28 say they support a one - year extension of the payroll tax cut , the fact that they refuse to pass the @entity31 measure that would provide a two - month extension and more time to negotiate shows they have a different agenda , she said			1
' whatever they say is irrelevant , " @entity2 said of @entity3 republicans			0
" what they do is what 's important , and what they 're doing is not giving a payroll tax cut to 160 million @entity119			0
" president @entity120 joined the @entity43 chorus , noting that @entity31 leaders from both parties had agreed to the short - term extension in order to guarantee that taxes do n't increase for working @entity119 while negotiations continue early next year on the one - year extension that @entity3 @entity28 say they support			1
" what they 're really holding out for is to wring concessions from @entity43 on issues that have nothing to do with the payroll tax cut , " @entity120 said of @entity3 republicans			2
another problem for @entity28 is that they have blocked votes in both chambers on payroll tax - cut proposals they crafted or endorsed			2
@entity3 @entity28 pushed through a bill extending the lower rate enacted last year through 2012 , but tacked on other provisions opposed by @entity43 and some @entity28 senators			2
senate minority leader @entity83 , @entity143 , was against holding a @entity31 vote on the @entity3 plan , apparently because he knew it would fail			2
on monday night , @entity3 @entity28 leaders ruled out a direct up - and - down vote on the @entity31 's two - month extension of the payroll tax cut			1
instead , the @entity3 on tuesday passed a procedural resolution that expressed disagreement with the @entity31 plan and called for a conference committee made up of members of both chambers to negotiate a compromise			2
@entity120 and @entity3 @entity43 called for a direct vote on the @entity31 plan , with @entity2 saying the refusal by @entity28 leaders to bring it up showed they feared enough @entity28 members would join the @entity43 minority to pass it			1
to @entity1 senior political analyst @entity162 , @entity28 have been " outmaneuvered " on the issue			2
@entity120 and the @entity43 have " put the @entity47 in the @entity3 into a position where they look like they are clearly obstructing , " @entity162 said			0
the unresolved dispute continued to pit @entity28 versus @entity28 on tuesday			0
five mostly moderate @entity28 senators have called for the @entity3 to support the @entity31 's two - month extension			1
one of them , sen. @entity168 of @entity169 , issued a statement after tuesday 's @entity3 vote that said @entity47 " would rather continue playing politics than find solutions			0
" " their actions will hurt @entity119 families and be detrimental to our fragile economy , " said @entity168 , who is facing a stiff re-election challenge in heavily @entity43 @entity169 next year			0
" we are @entity119 first ; now is not the time for drawing lines in the sand			0
" veteran @entity182 sen. @entity182 of @entity183 , who voted for the @entity31 's proposal , told @entity1 that the reality of the issue is that the payroll tax cut must be extended to help out @entity119 still struggling in the economic recovery			1
" it is harming the @entity28 , " @entity182 said of the continuing impasse			0
" it is harming the view , if it 's possible any more , of the @entity119 people about @entity22			0
