-- the severity of the numerous injuries i sustained could have been fatal			1
the most severe : getting the back of my skull crushed by the impact of the truck			1
i needed emergency brain surgery			1
my neurosurgeon had to remove part of my cerebellum because fragments of my skull had pierced it			2
after the surgery , he said to my parents , " i operated on him as if he had a chance			2
" but my parents never doubted i had a chance			2
after a two - month coma , i slowly came out of it , putting many doctors and the general medical profession in disbelief			1
my next step : a seven - month stay in a rehabilitation hospital			1
when a neurologist saw me for the first time , all i could do was move one finger on my right hand			1
he told my parents : " i am optimistic that @entity30 will gain enough strength in his right hand to type			1
" this statement stuck with me throughout the years			2
when i took my first steps after the accident , it was so sweet and gave me a sense of accomplishment			2
it was possibly the biggest event that made me realize just how wrong that doctor 's diagnosis of me had been			2
it 's been nine years since the accident and i still remember that statement every day			0
it helps me remember how wrong that neurologist was ; how i 've proved him wrong and how it motivates me to never let someone tell me what i can or can not do			1
healing wounds -- and souls -- a tattoo at a time when people ask me about my story , i never get to fully say what i want to because there is just so much to it			0
i often leave out the incredible impact of family , faith and friends			0
every day i was in a coma , my parents prayed for me and for it not to be my time , and to come back to them			0
they were so supportive throughout all of my recovery , as was the power of prayer and help from loving friends and the community			0
when the accident first happened , my local church held a prayer service for me			0
the church normally holds 500 people			0
but that night , there was standing room only -- all for a 9 - year - old boy			1
my mom lived with me in the rehabilitation hospital , making huge sacrifices every day to be there with me			0
my brother and my dad would frequently make the drive up to the hospital to see me and we would spend the day together ; it meant so much to me and made the rehab part a lot easier			0
when i was discharged from the hospital , friends and family from all over came together to help me by making giant get - well cards from various schools or having friends make dinner for us on a weekly basis			1
people that i did not even know expressed their concern for my well being from all around the country			0
now i 'm on my own bike team , the first paracycle team in the country			0
i 'm training six days a week for two hours or more , so i 'm doing all i can ( to get to the @entity104 ) and my heart 's there			1
just like in my recovery and how my parents knew all along my heart was so strong , i would overcome ( my accident ) , i have high hopes for 2016			1
' i will continue to fight until cancer gives up '			0
