a new @entity1 poll shows that it 's back to a toss - up for the 2014 midterms elections			1
a month ago , @entity5 were comfortably ahead 50 - 42 %			0
now the @entity6 are marginally ahead 49 - 47 % : a 10 - point swing in public opinion			1
of course , the figures do n't actually tell us who will win the next round of congressional elections , but they do remind us of a fact that escapes short - termist political punditry : voters react to events and are liable to change their mind			1
the rise and rise of president @entity22 's unbeatable rainbow coalition is not a historical inevitability but the product of temporary trends			1
to recap , the story a few months ago was that the @entity6 had proved themselves incapable of governing wisely and , therefore , of winning elections			2
by trying to use the shutdown to force a delay in the further implementation of @entity31 , they were accused of putting partisanship before country , of pushing @entity34 to the brink of destruction just to humiliate @entity22			1
their humiliation when the shutdown ended was shown in polling across all demographics			0
eight in 10 voters disapproved of the shutdown , including two in three @entity6 or independents who lean @entity6			1
but @entity47 triumphalism was short - lived			0
the latest polling showing a turnaround was prefigured by two election results that showed residual conservative strength			0
in one , @entity52 won a massive 2 - 1 victory that saw him make significant inroads into groups thought to be beyond the right 's reach : women , @entity59 and african - americans			2
in another , an unpopular ultraconservative @entity6 , @entity61 , lost his gubernatorial race in @entity64 but only by a small margin , despite being hugely outspent			1
@entity52 's win was probably driven by his personal appeal to voters , but while only 27 percent saw the health law as the top issue , the outcome of the @entity64 contest may well have been influenced by public annoyance over the botched rollout of the @entity31 exchanges			1
and it would be entirely justified by the trouble with the website and the disappointing discovery that millions could lose their existing coverage in spite of what the president repeatedly -- repeatedly -- told them			0
in other words , while the public turned against the @entity6 over the shutdown , they just as easily - and quickly - turned against the @entity5 over health care			2
crucially , the health care issue has a more direct impact upon their lives , which means its long - term resonance is likely to be greater			0
@entity22 's approval rating is now at its lowest since he took office , which also confirms the scale of the disaffection , and gives hope to the @entity6			1
the conclusion at the @entity102 is that , " race - by - race polling conducted over the last month has painted a grim picture of the difficult environment @entity5 are facing next year			0
" of course , this does n't mean things ca n't swing back the other way			0
the key word in all this data seems to be " volatility			0
" voters are fed up with @entity113 and disappointed in @entity22			1
who ends up benefiting from the misery will be down to events and good timing			2
either way , the idea that @entity22 established a new @entity120 coalition in 2012 that ca n't be broken by conservative politicians is clearly nonsense			2
join us @entity126 / @entity125 .			0

@entity128 : @entity1 poll shows @entity6 is now ahead for 2014 midterm elections
he says it shows voters react to events , in this case @entity31 *snafus* , are volatile
he says shutdown hurt @entity6 , but @entity52 and @entity64 race offered some good news
@entity128 : @entity22 coalition not *inviolable* ; voters fed up with him and @entity113 , will shift
