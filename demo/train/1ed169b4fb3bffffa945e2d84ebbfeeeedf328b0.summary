-- president @entity1 unveiled plans wednesday to open large swaths of @entity5 coastal waters in the @entity6 and the @entity7 to oil and natural gas drilling -- a move likely to please the energy industry but upset the administration 's environmentalist supporters			1
the administration plan would include lifting a 20 - year ban on drilling off the @entity18 coastline , while putting the clamps on sites such as southwest @entity22 's @entity21			1
parts of the @entity24 off @entity22 's @entity25 , however , could be accessed			0
the plan authorizes the @entity27 to conduct seismic surveys off the south - and @entity30 coasts to " determine the quantity and location of potential oil and gas resources to support energy planning , " according to a statement from a @entity39 official			1
what are your hopes for the environment ? roughly two - thirds of available oil and gas resources in the eastern @entity7 would be opened to drilling if a congressional moratorium on oil and gas operations in the region is lifted , according to the statement			1
drilling would occur more than 125 miles off the @entity54 coast			2
" this is not a decision that i 've made lightly , " @entity1 told an audience at @entity57 's @entity56			1
" but the bottom line is this : given our energy needs , in order to sustain economic growth and produce jobs and keep our businesses competitive , we 're going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable , homegrown energy			2
" the president was joined during his remarks by the secretaries of the interior , energy and the @entity78 , as well as the chairwoman of the @entity80			0
@entity82 leaders have pushed strongly for additional domestic drilling to lessen @entity5 's dependence on outside energy sources			1
one top @entity82 , however , argued @entity1 's plan does not go far enough			1
" it 's long past time for this administration to stop delaying @entity5 energy production off all our shores , " said @entity39 minority leader @entity87 , @entity88			1
" opening up areas off the @entity18 coast to offshore production is a positive step , but keeping the @entity98 and @entity22 , as well as the most promising resources of the @entity7 , under lock and key makes no sense at a time when gasoline prices are rising and @entity5 are asking ' where are the jobs ? ' " a top @entity107 @entity106 also ripped the decision , arguing it could harm marine life while damaging the economy in coastal communities			1
" giving @entity115 more access to our nation 's waters is really a ' @entity121 ' policy , " said sen. @entity113 , @entity114			0
" it threatens to kill jobs , kill marine life and kill coastal economies that generate billions of dollars			0
offshore drilling is n't the solution to our energy problems , and i will fight this policy and continue to push for 21st - century clean - energy solutions			1
" environmentalists critical of @entity1 drilling plan house speaker @entity134 , @entity135 , warned that any offshore or onshore plan should proceed in an environmentally and fiscally responsible manner			1
" taxpayers who own these resources have been historically shortchanged from the huge profits received from drilling on public lands , and must receive a fair return in the future , " she said			2
another key @entity106 , sen. @entity145 of @entity18 , praised the move , calling it " good news and a positive step forward as we work to expand our nation 's domestic energy production			2
" " moving forward on the @entity30 offshore proposal will provide an opportunity to determine the scope of our region 's offshore energy resources , the economic viability of accessing those resources and the potential impacts on our environmental and national security priorities , " he said			2
@entity18 gov. @entity163 , a @entity82 , joined @entity145 in enthusiastically backing the decision			1
" @entity165 will benefit from the thousands of jobs that will be created and the economic activity and development that will accompany this vital industry 's arrival in the state , " @entity163 said in a statement			0
@entity1 sought to portray his decision as politically pragmatic and centrist , balancing the country 's growing energy needs and environmental concerns			2
the administration has been " guided not by political ideology , but by scientific evidence , " he said			0
" we need to move beyond the tired debates between right and left , between business leaders and environmentalists , between those who would claim drilling is a cure - all and those who would claim it has no place			2
because this issue is just too important to allow our progress to languish while we fight the same old battles over and over again			0
" the president warned that increased drilling could only be a partial solution at best			0
the @entity5 controls less than 2 percent of the world 's oil reserves but accounts for more than 20 percent of global oil consumption , he noted			1
@entity39 spokesmen @entity200 and @entity201 said the announcement was being made at @entity203 -- the home base of presidential airplane @entity205 -- because it 's an appropriate place to discuss energy security			0
in addition to discussing his plans for offshore drilling , @entity1 talked about the importance of making greater use of biofuels			1
the @entity214 is the @entity216 's largest consumer of jet fuel , consuming 2.4 billion gallons annually , according to @entity200 and @entity201			0
the @entity214 , however , is attempting to transition to a greater use of alternative fuels			0
in addition , the @entity220 and the @entity221 are set to sign an agreement thursday establishing fuel economy standards for cars and trucks for model years 2012 to 2016			0
" we are implementing policies that will greatly reduce our dependence on foreign oil , " the official said , noting the @entity39 is leading by example and will announce the purchase of 5,000 hybrid vehicles for the federal fleet			0
@entity0 's @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
