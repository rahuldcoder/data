@entity0 -- without @entity3 publicly forgiving him , it is unlikely that @entity5 would be running to become @entity7 's next mayor			1
" if his wife had not been by his side , @entity5 's hot dog would be cooked , " said @entity8 , a @entity9 political consultant and @entity1 contributor			1
from the start of @entity5 's campaign , @entity3 's blessing had been critical			1
once @entity5 acknowledged a desire to run for mayor , a year after the former @entity7 congressman resigned over a sexting scandal in 2011 , @entity3 blessed her husband 's political aspirations in a number of high profile interviews			1
@entity25 : @entity5 's problem is our problem , too and on tuesday , after another round of sexting allegations emerged , @entity3 once again stood beside him and publicly announced her forgiveness			1
" it took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to a place where i could forgive @entity5 , " @entity3 said			1
" it was not an easy choice in any way , but i made the decision that it was worth staying in this marriage			0
" @entity3 steps from scandal 's shadow into spotlight political consultants , psychologists and crisis communicators all give different opinions on why @entity3 , a powerful @entity0 adviser and close confidant to former secretary of state @entity50 , publicly forgave her husband			1
but by standing next to @entity5 on tuesday , @entity3 joins a long line of political wives -- including @entity54 , her mentor -- who stood next to their men as they answered questions about sexual impropriety			1
winning back trust -- from your wife most experts said if @entity3 had n't stood next to him , @entity5 's campaign for mayor could have been finished			1
instead the campaign is severely damaged , but not irreparably			2
" from a communication standpoint , i or any other person in my field would say the same thing			2
tell the truth , get your wife up there with you , get her support and win the election , " crisis communication expert @entity71 said			2
@entity71 said that winning the support of the person closest to you -- the person whose trust you damaged the most -- is the most important part of that formula			1
opinion : why does @entity5 's wife stay ? " once you have a wife , a spouse , standing up there and saying , ' i forgive him , ' what right do we have , theoretically , to hold it against him , " @entity71 said			1
" the truth is the ultimate spin and if he comes out and says , ' i made a mistake , i made my peace with my wife and she has forgiven me and now i want to be mayor of @entity7			0
' what do you , as a voter , say ? " calls for ' @entity102 ' to step aside pour in does a wife 's blessing help make a political comeback ? " yes , it is critical , " said @entity106 , a former adviser to president @entity54 and a partner at the @entity109 communications company			1
but that might be changing , he said			0
" i think we are in a real transition period here , " he said			0
as proof , @entity106 points to newly elected @entity116 @entity117 rep. @entity116 of @entity118			0
after the then - governor admitted to sneaking away to @entity121 to be with his mistress in june 2009 , @entity119 moved out of the governor 's mansion and later divorced him			1
but @entity116 , after offering a mea culpa to the people of @entity118 , triumphed in special election last month			0
" i think the conventional wisdom that the wife has to be supportive and that they ca n't be out there trashing you , " @entity106 said			0
" @entity118 may show that is changing , though			0
" @entity134 , lewd photos and @entity7 's mayoral race : an @entity5 timeline politics and publicity women in @entity3 's position are in a no - win situation , said dr. @entity143 , a clinical psychologist			1
" if they do n't stand by that person , their family could be very much hurt by this , " he said			2
there are a number of reasons that women stay with an unfaithful man , @entity143 said : children , religious beliefs , a feeling that they can change			2
but when politics and publicity are involved , the situation is dramatically altered			2
@entity50 was with her husband in january 1998 when he denied having " sexual relations with that woman , miss @entity161			0
" though she notably distanced herself from him as they later walked to @entity165 , the duo is still married today			0
" i think the campaign is much more difficult when the person next to you walks away , " @entity143 said			1
" the message is ' i am through with this person , i think he is deeply flawed			2
' if you , the person who knows him best , walks away from him , it is harder for the public to believe in him			2
" the enduring image of tuesday 's news conference -- where a uncomfortable @entity3 stood next to her husband -- sent mixed messages to voters and was a risky proposal , @entity177 said			1
" not having the wife next to you can be certainly , in the short term , a death knell , " @entity177 said			0
" but having her out there is a risky proposal because for most people , certainly most women , it was painful to watch her public humiliation and the guy responsible standing right next to her , looking over her shoulder			2
i think every woman watching that puts herself in that position			0
" but according @entity106 , sort of public awkwardness is better than the alternative			0
" i think that having the wife somehow involved , to whatever degree is very important , " @entity106 said			0
" what is important is to be viewed as not totally accepting , because then it looks like the marriage is a joke			0
but you have to have enough sense of acknowledgment and contrition that is looks and sounds genuine			0
" should @entity3 stand by her man ? a mutually dependent relationship the theory @entity216 , a crisis communications professor at @entity218 , thinks about most when he sees a news conference like @entity5 's is " co-dependency			1
" " it is the idea that people assume that it is better to fight through the relationship than break it off , " @entity216 said			0
" i get the sense that is the case with @entity5			0
" the reason for co-dependency , @entity216 speculates , is possibly political aspirations for the family , not just her husband			0
that opinion was echoed by a number of experts			0
as for why @entity3 stood next to @entity5 , @entity106 said , " it is probably a combination of support , humility , embarrassment and ego			1
" @entity177 , who described @entity3 as " a very strong , independent , successful " woman , said her standing beside @entity5 on tuesday opened the family up to a different line of questioning			1
" why do people want this so bad that they are willing to subject themselves to this humiliation again ? " opinion : the public humiliation of @entity3			2

@entity3 's blessing was critical to his mayoral campaign
