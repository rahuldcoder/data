-- @entity1 wants to beef up its cell coverage by thinking small and piggybacking on your internet service			1
the carrier is offering its customers a free personal cell spot -- a router that plugs into an existing broadband connection to improve mobile phone coverage while at home			1
all new smartphones purchased through @entity1 will allow phone calls and texts over @entity15			1
and as mentioned in @entity17 's announcement tuesday , @entity1 will be the first carrier to support seamless switching between @entity15 and cellular networks , so you do n't have to hang up and redial when you leave the wireless area			1
