@entity0 -- it was an odd collection of vehicles on display on @entity5 , ranging from a bucket truck used for repairing power lines to something resembling an enclosed golf cart to a pair of hot - looking , two - seater sports cars			1
lawmakers eyeball one of several alternative - energy vehicles parked this week on @entity5			1
what they had in common was alternative energy : the cars run on electricity and biofuels as well as gasoline			1
tuesday 's display attracted some @entity23 senators who could n't resist taking the vehicles for a spin			1
" i 'm about to have claustrophobia ! " laughed sen. @entity26 , @entity27 , as he folded himself into a yellow , low - slung vehicle known by the initials @entity30 , developed by the @entity31			2
" @entity35 [ @entity37 senator from @entity38 ] and i were talking about taking a road trip in the van down there , " said @entity26 , pointing to a nearby offering from @entity34			1
" that 's probably better for a road trip than this ! " @entity26 then spotted @entity37 colleague @entity45 , and joked that the sports car might draw too much attention in the @entity50 senator 's corn country			0
undeterred , @entity45 climbed in next and asked to take a test drive			0
but instead of starting with a growling engine and a roar of exhaust , the little yellow coupe simply rolled quietly out of its parking space			0
it is an electric vehicle			0
the display , titled " @entity59 , " was intended to demonstrate for lawmakers actual production models of vehicles that may cut the nation 's reliance on petroleum - based fuels			1
an unusual aspect of the show was that traditional @entity69 nameplates such as @entity34 sat next to competitors from other countries			1
the event was organized by @entity73 , a small carmaker from @entity74 , @entity38 , to showcase its idea , a new , 100 - mpg plug - in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets			1
in a statement , the company said it has applied for funding through the federal @entity82			0
other manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display , in a parking lot near the @entity89			1
during the @entity93 administration , @entity91 automakers complained they were n't invited to a similar demonstration near the @entity95 , despite having brought their alternative - energy cars more swiftly to the @entity23 market than the @entity69 automakers			1
but neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a @entity34 product spokesman at tuesday 's display			1
" if anything , it 's just a little bit of noise in the background , " said @entity105 , a @entity34 vehicle line director			1
he told @entity1 the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of @entity114 electric cars expected to come to market by november 2010			2
a silver @entity34 sedan on display nearby uses electric batteries and a self - contained recharging engine powered by a variety of fuels			1
" i would like people to stop talking mpg , " @entity105 said , leading a reporter toward a van powered by a hydrogen fuel cell			0
the @entity127 on display is one of 100 now in private hands			2
instead of miles per gallon , the energy plant supplies electricity and a calculation of cruising range while driving			2
for now , however , drivers might still be impressed by the @entity136 , a little car claiming 280 miles per gallon			1
the car 's cruising range of about 40 miles translates to about 280 miles per gallon , according to the @entity141 automaker			0
" @entity136 " stands for @entity142 , said a worker who was buffing away some tree pollen that had settled on the car during the breezy afternoon			1
the car 's top speed is about that of a strong gust of wind -- 35 mph			0
" it 's supposed to be your third car in the driveway , " explained @entity136 spokesman @entity151			1
" most people drive less than 20 miles from home on streets with speed limits of 35 miles per hour or less			0
" he acknowledged that the car may qualify as street - legal only on local , low - speed roads			2
but @entity151 said the @entity136 is a dramatic improvement in both safety and driveability , compared with the golf carts often seen around retirement communities			2
among the other alternative energy vehicles on display were cars from @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and the smart car company			1
another brand shown to lawmakers is named after @entity178 , an inventor who helped develop the practical use of electricity a century ago			0
@entity182 's system of alternating current eventually displaced @entity185 's use of direct current in the nation 's early power grid			0
the red , two - seater electric sports car on display might have been a good fit for @entity182 , a lifelong bachelor			2
@entity26 , the @entity27 senator , suggested the two sports cars were classic " chick magnets			2
" @entity182 spokesman @entity195 told @entity1 his company now has about 400 of the sleek , aerodynamic cars in private hands			0
" we 've created a viable car , and we came out with this model first to help draw attention to the @entity182 brand , " he said			0
the @entity205 - based company also is developing a a sedan that will use the same advanced battery technology as the sports car , which costs about $ 109,000			0
" it will be the kind of car you can take on a trip , and carry four passengers and their luggage , " @entity195 said			0
it uses 7,000 lithium - ion cells of the same chemistry now powering cell phones and laptop computers			0
" we are working on a battery exchange program that will cut the cost of these vehicles by about $ 35,000 , " @entity195 said , describing a leasing program where owners can swap a used - up battery back for a new one			2
most of the vehicles on display qualify for a new $ 7,500 federal rebate intended to encourage car buyers to consider alternative - energy vehicles			1
perhaps the vehicle that caused the most double - takes tuesday was a bucket truck from the local electric utility company serving the @entity0 , area			0
the @entity239 vehicle , the kind seen repairing downed power lines , runs on biofuels that range from discarded cooking grease to soybean oil			0
the truck was apparently not for sale , and there were no representatives nearby to answer questions .			0
