-- wow ! if you think @entity3 football is boring , you must not have been watching this weekend			0
the league 's top teams have provided a feast of breathtaking games the past two days			0
first , on saturday , the @entity8 kept retiring linebacker @entity10 ' career alive by stunning @entity11 and the @entity12 38 - 35 in double overtime			1
after 60 minutes of jaw - dropping kick returns and crazy - close calls , @entity14 sealed it with a 47 - yard field goal in sudden death			0
later that day , young 49ers quarterback @entity20 set a rushing record and racked up 400 total yards to humble the vaunted @entity24 defense in a convincing 45 - 31 win in @entity26			1
then on sunday , the @entity27 roared back from a 20 - 0 halftime deficit against the @entity29 and went ahead 28 - 27 with just 31 seconds left on the clock in @entity31			1
the @entity29 appeared finished , but @entity32 and @entity33 drove far enough after the ensuing kickoff to give @entity35 a shot at a 49 - yard field goal with 13 seconds left			2
@entity35 's boot was wide right , but @entity39 had called a timeout just before the snap , giving the @entity29 a do - over			2
@entity35 did n't miss twice , drilling the long field goal with eight seconds remaining			0
a hail mary pass by sensational @entity27 rookie quarterback @entity45 was caught in the end zone -- by sticky - handed @entity29 receiver @entity47 , who was put in on defense for just such an emergency			2
