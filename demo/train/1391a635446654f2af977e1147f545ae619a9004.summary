-- ethnic tensions in the @entity2 and an incident involving a drone led to the abandonment of a major @entity7 international football game tuesday			1
@entity10 's @entity9 qualifying match with @entity11 was abandoned after 41 minutes following ugly clashes between both sets of players			1
the brawl followed the arrival of a mini-drone , which flew over the stadium while carrying a flag depicting the " @entity11			1
" when @entity10 player @entity21 ripped the flag down , it provided the catalyst for an already combustible tie to fully ignite			1
@entity25 , the @entity26 referee , took the players off the field with the game goalless following clashes between rival players			2
see images of the incident there were no signs of the tie being restarted with @entity37 , the game 's @entity7 governing body , confirming the game had been abandoned			1
@entity41 players ran from the field , while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters			1
images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch			0
in a statement on its website , @entity37 said that the match " was abandoned and the circumstances will be reported to the @entity55			1
" it is expected to make an announcement on disciplinary proceedings on wednesday			0
the " @entity11 " insignia refers to the idea of an extended area in which all ethnic @entity41 reside -- one which would include @entity62			1
the two figures on the flag were @entity65 , an @entity41 nationalist who led uprisings against the @entity10 and @entity67 in 1912 and 1913 , while the other , @entity68 , is considered to be the founder of the modern @entity41 state , which became independent in 1912			1
the word " @entity75 , " which refers to an indigenous inhabitant of a place , was emblazoned at the bottom of the flag and is considered an offense to @entity10			1
the brother of @entity41 prime minister @entity82 was arrested in @entity10 on tuesday night following the brawl , the office of the @entity10 prime minister told @entity0 on wednesday			1
@entity86 was held briefly before being released at the insistence of @entity10 prime minister @entity85 , then put on a plane home , @entity85 's office said			1
" what happened is something we ca n't comprehend at the moment , " @entity10 captain @entity89 told reporters			2
" on behalf of my team , all i can say is that we wanted to carry on and that we shielded the @entity41 players every step of the way to the tunnel ( after the riot broke out )			1
" the @entity41 team said they were unfit physically and mentally to carry on after talking to the officials and they will now decide the fate of this match			2
" we can only regret that football took a back seat but it is difficult to draw any conclusions or make any comments now			0
" security had been tight in the lead up to the contest in @entity113 with no away fans present with tensions running high over @entity62 -- a majority - @entity41 former @entity10 province which declared independence in 2008			1
in 1999 , a 78 - day air war was launched by @entity119 to stop the killing off ethnic @entity41 in @entity62 by @entity10 forces			1
@entity62 's independence is recognized by many countries including the @entity123 , the @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 -- but not @entity10			2
four of @entity11 's starting lineup were born in @entity62 , with @entity128 of @entity130 club @entity129 , goalkeeper @entity131 , midfielder @entity132 and @entity133			2
with @entity62 not recognized as a state by the @entity136 , it is unable to join @entity137 or @entity37 , meaning some of its players have adopted other countries			2
@entity140 , who plays his club football with @entity142 , represents @entity143 as does @entity144 and @entity145			0
while @entity62 is able to play friendly matches , the team can not compete in international competition			0
@entity150 - born @entity149 , one of the most exciting talents in the @entity152 with @entity153 , turned down the opportunity to play for @entity62 , where his father is from			0
he was also eligible for @entity11 through his mother 's lineage			2
" we came to @entity113 to play football , but we were physically attacked by the @entity10 supporters , " @entity128 told reporters			1
" we just wanted to take the flag , and everything would be under control if the stadium security at the stadium had prevented the supporters from attacking our players			2
" i was defending my teammate , i have injuries to my face , as does @entity172			0
they asked us to play in front of empty stands ( instead of abandonment ) -- however , we did not feel good because of our injuries			0
" @entity11 had not played in @entity113 since 1967 and must now wait for @entity37 to make a decision on whether the game should be replayed			1
" it is a regretful situation on which we will report ; the referee , myself and the security adviser			0
the circumstances were such that we could n't continue the match , " @entity37 's match delegate , @entity183 told reporters			2
" you all saw what happened and i can not comment on who is to blame or what to blame			0
i will submit a report with my colleagues to @entity37 and @entity37 will decide what will happen further			0
" @entity125 stifled elsewhere , @entity125 's poor run of form continued after it was held to a 1 - 1 draw in @entity197 by the @entity198			0
@entity200 ' long - range effort appeared to have sealed victory for the home side but @entity203 marked his 100th appearance with a dramatic late equalizer			0
@entity206 , which defeated @entity125 2 - 0 last time out , was forced to settle for a point following a 2 - 2 draw with @entity210			0
@entity211 celebrated reaching 100 million @entity213 fans by scoring a 95th minute winner in @entity216 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity217			0
elsewhere , @entity219 's remarkable run of form means it has now won three qualifying games in a row			0
a 2 - 0 victory in @entity225 courtesy of goals from @entity227 and @entity228 means it sits top of @entity230 with maximum points			0
@entity0 's @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
