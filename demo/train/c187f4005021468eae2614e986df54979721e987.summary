-- an atheist sign criticizing @entity2 that was erected alongside a nativity scene was taken from the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , on friday and later found in a ditch			1
the @entity8 had a placard up in the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6			1
an employee from country radio station @entity11 in @entity13 told @entity0 the sign was dropped off at the station by someone who found it in a ditch			1
" i thought it would be safe , " @entity8 co-founder @entity20 told @entity0 earlier friday			2
" it 's always a shock when your sign is censored or stolen or mutilated			1
it 's not something you get used to			2
" the sign , which celebrates the winter solstice , has had some residents and @entity2 organizations calling atheists @entity30 because they said it was attacking the celebration of @entity33 's birth			1
" religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds , " the sign from the @entity8 says in part			1
the sign , which was at the @entity4 at 6:30 a.m. @entity42 , was gone by 7:30 a.m. , @entity20 said			1
the incident will not stifle the group 's message , @entity20 said			2
before reports of the placard 's recovery , she said a temporary sign with the same message would be placed in the building 's @entity51			1
@entity20 said a note would be attached saying , " thou shalt not steal			2
" " i guess they do n't follow their own commandments , " @entity20 said			2
" there 's nothing out there with the atheist point of view , and now there is such a firestorm that we have the audacity to exist			2
and then [ whoever took the sign ] stifles our speech			1
" @entity20 said that police are checking security cameras pointed at the building 's entrances and exits to see if they can see anyone stealing the sign			1
" it 's probably about 50 pounds , " @entity20 said			2
" my brother - in - law was huffing and puffing carrying it up the stairs			0
it 's definitely not something you can stick under your arm or conceal			0
" the @entity82 , which is handling the incident , could not be reached for comment			0
@entity85 , a former evangelical preacher and co-founder of the group , said it was important for atheists to see their viewpoints validated alongside everyone else 's			1
@entity85 said the display is especially important given that 25 percent of @entity94 residents are unaffiliated with religion or do not believe in @entity96			1
( a recent survey by the @entity98 found 23 percent of @entity99 said they were unaffiliated with a religion and 7 percent said they did n't believe in @entity96			1
) " it 's not that we are trying to coerce anyone ; in a way our sign is a signal of protest , " @entity85 said			1
" if there can be a @entity112 scene saying that we are all going to hell if we do n't bow down to @entity33 , we should be at the table to share our views			1
" he said if anything , it 's the nativity scene that is the intrusion			0
" most people think december is for @entity120 and view our signs as an intrusion , when actually it 's the other way around , " he said			0
" people have been celebrating the winter solstice long before @entity126			0
we see christianity as the intruder , trying to steal the holiday from all of us humans			0
" the scene in @entity94 is not unfamiliar			1
@entity85 has had signs in @entity133 , @entity134 , for 13 years			0
the placard is often turned around so the message ca n't be seen , and one year , someone threw acid on it , forcing the group to encase it in @entity141			1
in @entity6 , the @entity142 began a bus ad campaign this month questioning belief in @entity96			1
" why believe in a @entity96 ? " the advertisement asks			0
" just be good for goodness sake			0
" that ad has caused the @entity148 to field hundreds of complaints , the group said , but it has heard just as much positive feedback , said @entity152 , the association 's spokesman			0
@entity152 said the ad campaign , which features a shrugging @entity155 , was not meant to attack @entity126 but rather to reach out to an untapped audience			0
@entity152 maintains the campaign began in december mostly because the group had extra money left over for the year			0
the connection to @entity126 is a coincidence , he said			0
" there are a lot of people out there who do n't know there are organizations like ours to serve their needs , " @entity152 said			0
" the thing is , to reach a minority group , in order to be heard , everyone in the room has to hear you , even when they do n't want to			0
" the ad campaign , @entity152 said , is to make people think			0
he said he does n't expect to " convert " anyone			0
but the @entity180 is urging members to oppose the advertisements			0
" although a number of humanists and atheists continue to attempt to rid @entity96 and @entity126 from the public square , the @entity187 people are overwhelmingly opposed to such efforts , " @entity183 , the group 's president said in a press release			2
" we will ask our millions of supporters to call the city of @entity6 , and @entity195 to stop this @entity197 campaign			1
" as far as the criticism goes , @entity152 said there are far more controversial placards in @entity6			1
" that 's @entity6 -- this is a political center , " he said			1
" if i can see a placard with dead fetuses on it , i think someone can look at our question and just think about it			2
" the anger over the display in @entity5 began after it was assembled monday			1
the sentiment grew after some national media personalities called upon viewers to flood the phone lines of the governor 's office			0
the governor 's office told the @entity218 it received more than 200 calls an hour afterward			2
" i happen to be a @entity2 , and i do n't agree with the display that is up there , " @entity6 gov. @entity220 told @entity222 newspaper			1
" but that does n't mean that as governor , i have the right to deny their ability to express their free speech			0
" for some , the issue is n't even that the atheists are putting their thoughts on display , but rather the way in which they are doing it			2
" they are shooting themselves in the foot , " said @entity239 contributor @entity237 , who describes himself as an atheist			0
" everyone 's out there for the holidays , trying to represent their religion , their beliefs , and it 's a time to be positive			2
" the atheist message was never intended to attack anyone , @entity85 said			0
" when people ask us , ' why are you hateful ? why are you putting up something critical of people 's holidays ? -- we respond that we kind of feel that the @entity2 message is the hate message , " he said			1
" on that nativity scene , there is this threat of internal violence if we do n't submit to that master			0
hate speech goes both ways			0
