-- what i first noticed when arriving in @entity3 , beyond the world 's tallest free - standing flag pole , was the oil derricks in the @entity7 , visible from western hotels steadily rising along the coast			1
where other cities might dress the skyline to lure visitors to the beach , or to take a boat cruise , @entity10 is all about its energy wealth			1
the country of eight million people benefits from having started early in the oil game -- in 1846 the country drilled the first oil well in the world -- but all that is well known , as is the country 's push to extract more oil off shore in the @entity7			2
country profile : @entity10 what should become more well - known is the country 's attempt to diversify away from oil and focus more on natural gas			1
to the ever expanding gratitude of @entity35 , @entity10 is close to tripling the amount of natural gas processed through its @entity38 facility south of @entity3			1
soon the owners of the @entity41 natural gas lease in the @entity7 will choose from a host of competing pipeline consortiums to bring more natural gas to @entity35			1
most importantly , it means more gas heating rooms in @entity47 and @entity48 that does not come from @entity49			0
as one of the most potent symbols to me of the rising energy wealth , seaside luxury homes are being built directly across the street from the vast @entity38 oil and gas refinery south of @entity3			1
from the front bedroom the new owners will overlook ever more derricks			0
from the back yard , it is the refinery			0
still , i saw more than a dozen of these little palaces under construction			0
so , what else can @entity10 do to move away from oil ? information technology is one of the bigger pushes			1
if you look at a map of the country , you can see why it , software and social media companies are reputably looking to set up regional hubs there			0
firstly , students are learning @entity80 , which is the international language of technology			0
secondly , many still speak @entity84			0
the legacy of the @entity86 means workers can not only communicate easily with neighboring @entity49 , but also with potential customers in @entity89 and @entity90 -- two fast growing countries in the region			0
add to that two obvious connections : language with @entity95 and ethnicity with @entity97			0
if you are setting up a regional company , @entity3 would be one of the first places you would have to study			2
@entity10 's economy does of course suffer from some of the leftovers of the @entity106 era			1
the roads outside @entity3 are terrible			2
there are also simmering tensions with neighbor @entity110 ( not seen on maps whenever i looked at one around the city ) and the region is not stable when you add in @entity117 , @entity49 and @entity118			0
@entity10 is also using its money to reinvigorate the fishing industry , once it has cleaned up the @entity7			2
it is also building a vast complex , the size of @entity122 , of new housing , shops and hotels near the port called @entity128			0
it 's a tip of the hat to what @entity3 used to be known as when it produced half the world 's oil -- the @entity134			1
one day , @entity3 might even become a tourist attraction			2
thousands of people will be flocking here next year when the country 's hosts the @entity139 finals			0
test your knowledge of @entity10 these fans will see a brand new convention center , a new museum in the shape of a rolled up carpet to capture the country 's love of making carpets and exporting them around the world , a massive new embankment ringing the @entity7 giving people a chance to walk nearly the length of the city , and explore the amazing @entity157 -- one of the finest in the world and mostly unknown outside the @entity160			2
then , if , and it 's a big if , the @entity163 chooses @entity3 over @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 to host the @entity168 , the world will awake to the rise of @entity10			1
@entity3 must be seen as a long shot , but it was put to me by several people , that like the @entity174 themselves , it is more important to take part in the process than to necessarily win			1
@entity3 wants to be seen on a world stage and is learning what steps to take for its growing economy and wealth to be noticed far and wide .			1

@entity3 , capital city of @entity10 is *reveling* in its energy wealth
*concerted* efforts made to diversify national economy away from oil
is tripling amount of natural gas produced and moving to *encourage* it sector
@entity134 is bidding to host @entity174 in 2020
