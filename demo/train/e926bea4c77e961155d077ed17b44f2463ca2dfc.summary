president @entity0 called for calm monday night , moments after a @entity4 prosecutor announced there would be no indictment against the police officer who shot and killed @entity8			1
his measured tone stood in stunning contrast to the images of violence on the streets of @entity14 that intensified on a split screen			2
as the president spoke -- warning protesters that throwing bottles and smashing car windows wo n't help -- some members of the crowds of hundreds in @entity14 were doing just that			1
police responded by firing tear gas			2
@entity0 said anger over a grand jury 's decision not to indict officer @entity28 is an " understandable reaction			1
" but he urged protesters to remain peaceful and called on law enforcement officers in the city of @entity14 to exercise " care and restraint in managing peaceful protests that may occur			1
" " we are a nation built on the rule of law , and so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury 's to make , " @entity0 said late monday night			1
" there are @entity42 who agree with it and there are @entity42 who are deeply disappointed , even angry			0
it 's an understandable reaction			1
but i join @entity8 's parents in asking anyone who protests this decision to do so peacefully			1
" elsewhere in the country , angry demonstrators took to the streets peacefully in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , as more than 120 vigils and gatherings were organized nationwide			1
some are scheduled for tuesday			0
@entity60 : @entity14 investigation will continue the president said the inflamed tensions over the case , both in @entity14 and elsewhere , are in part a result of decades - old strains in race relations			1
" there is inevitably going to be some negative reaction , and it 'll make for good tv , " @entity0 said			1
" but what we want to do is to make sure that we 're also focusing on those who can offer the kind of real progress that we know is possible -- that the vast majority of people @entity14 , the @entity81 region , in @entity4 and around the country are looking for , " he said			0
" i want to be partners with those folks and we need to lift up the kind of constructive dialogue that is taking place			0

a police car was smash , while another was engulfed in fire			2
gunshots could be heard and looting took place			0
in nearby @entity108 , a row of cars were set afire at a car dealership , as more businesses were torched			2
the grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity28 was sharply criticized by the chairwoman of the @entity114 , rep. @entity115 , who called the proceedings a " miscarriage of justice			2
" ' a thousand @entity120 across @entity42 ' " it is a slap in the face to @entity42 nationwide who continue to hope and believe that justice will prevail , " the @entity122 @entity121 said			0
" this decision seems to underscore an unwritten rule that black lives hold no value ; that you may kill black men in this country without consequences or repercussions			0
this is a frightening narrative for every parent and guardian of black and brown children , and another setback for race relations in @entity42			1
" @entity4 sen. @entity141 , a @entity142 , said he joins @entity8 's family in urging protesters to remain peaceful -- and said he hopes to see law enforcement officers improve their tactics after @entity8 's death			0
" i 've talked extensively to law enforcement officials to learn more about the tactics , resources , and procedures that our first responders utilize statewide , " @entity141 said in a statement			0
" law enforcement officials have been candid in identifying ways officers could have handled the situation in @entity14 better , and i trust those recommendations will be helpful as we continue to count on them to protect us			0
