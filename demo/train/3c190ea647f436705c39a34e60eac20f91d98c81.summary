-- when i was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis , i was told it was n't going to be a big deal			1
things may change , but hopefully not much			0
unfortunately , my form of the genetic disorder has caused thousands of tumors throughout my body , and pain that i never thought possible			0
i spent more than 180 days in a hospital room 1,000 miles from home and have had basically every plan in my life change			0
but through these immense trials , when i was ready to give up , when i wanted to let go , my family , my community and my doctors were there to fight for me			1
when i first heard what my brother @entity22 's friend @entity21 had come up with , i thought it was hilarious , and would surely get them arrested			1
but leave it to them to make it actually work			0
i mean , it is incredible really , what the @entity33 's @entity32 team has been able to do in three years			1
this year alone , the events raised more than $ 1.3 million for neurofibromatosis research			1
who would have thought that running around in your underwear could do such good ? seemingly every day , i am reminded how amazing and dedicated our friends are			2
@entity21 , his fiancee , @entity44 , and @entity45 , to name just a few , take hours and hours of their spare time to make this race work			0
they get nothing in return , other than the joy of seeing a good idea make a difference in people 's lives			2
i 'm just lucky to be one of those people			0
since my brother joined the @entity61 to raise money for research and increase awareness of neurofibromatosis , i have been prescribed the off - label use of a cancer drug to shrink my tumors , and the results have been nothing short of miraculous			1
@entity33 's @entity32 : benefiting the @entity61 sans pants i have gone from being bedridden to driving , from a regiment of pain killers to almost none , and now i 'm planning to go back to school to become a math teacher			1
i would never have chosen to have this disorder or to fight this fight , but it does give a unique opportunity to see the best in people			0
this year , @entity85 's was held in 18 cities , with countless volunteers dedicating their free time			1
people often tell me that i 'm an " inspiration , " but to me , these volunteers , this team -- they are my inspiration			2
@entity91 is a terrible thing , but with an organization like the @entity61 , and with people like those who make @entity33 's possible , i have an unwavering belief that nothing will stop us from ending this disease			2
the neurofibromatosis community will be forever grateful for their gift , and all i can do is say thank you .			0
