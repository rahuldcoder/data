@entity0 -- from her perch atop a church bell tower high above downtown @entity0 , @entity2 watched as runners from all over the world trudged down @entity7 for the final stretch of the city 's 117th annual marathon			1
" people often call it the ' @entity21 , ' " said @entity2 , a senior minister and ceo of the @entity12 in @entity0 , pointing to the brush of blue and yellow paint that spell out the word " finish " in bold letters on @entity7 's pavement outside			1
the church 's colonial - era congregation -- which included @entity24 and the @entity25 who first gathered to plan the @entity26 -- is part of the legacy of a city propped up by its past			1
the church reopened monday as authorities removed the last remaining barricades to restore a semblance of normal life			1
" there is no question that we are shaken , " said @entity2			1
she does n't think the city will be quite the same			0
many shops , restaurants and bars along @entity7 have reopened since twin bombings at the marathon 's finish line on april 15 killed three people and wounded more than 260 others			1
a popular eatery called @entity49 , which sustained heavy damage , remains boarded up as workers in hazmat suits clean blood - stained floors and remove shattered glass windows			0
@entity56 cover shows city 's heart @entity59 was sipping a mimosa with some friends at the @entity62 when a fireball ignited outside her window			2
" it was thunderous , " she recalled			0
the restaurant , a @entity7 fixture , remains closed as a result of the blast			1
by most accounts , many in @entity0 seem to have come to terms what transpired , though a once - distant perception of terror has now become more personally felt in the days since the attack			1
" there 's a pause and a fear , but we 're not going to be defeated by two punks , " said @entity77 , whose shoe store reopened monday after being part of a crime scene for the past week			1
" like everything else , time is the best medicine			0
" cleaning crews continue to mop up the remnants of glass and scattered debris , while painters splash green paint onto wrought iron gates and wooden moldings atop store fronts , blackened in last week 's attack			1
@entity99 , who owns an eyeglass store on @entity101 , said that returning to work brought an eeriness accompanied by sadness			2
a floral memorial sits directly outside her window , where passersby come to pay their respects			0
she catches herself staring at it when work is slow			0
after @entity0 : the pros and cons of surveillance cameras " we 're ready to get back to normal , " she said			1
" we 're not going to sit back and take it			0
" tough talk is commonplace here , as hardy @entity119 appear to be keen to move on			0
that sense of resiliency also seems inextricable from the city 's history			2
even younger residents drop off - the - cuff references to figures like @entity127 in their casual bar - room banter			0
here , @entity129 is n't just the name of a popular beer			0
" this is not a young city , " @entity2 said			1
" we 've been tried and tested over centuries			0
we 've been through wars			0
we 've been through witch trials			0
so it 's not as if we have n't seen horror before			2
" her stone church looms almost directly over the marathon finish line , where its 19th - century spire is a welcome sight to runners , signaling their 26.2 - mile trek is nearly over			1
up until last week , the church had been shuttered only once in its history , which dates back to @entity25 's first @entity150 settlers			1
" we were taken over by the @entity153 , who were a little upset with us because we dumped their tea , " said @entity2 , describing the only other time the church formally closed in 1775			1
after last week 's terror attacks , police barricaded @entity7 and made @entity2 's church grounds part of the crime scene			1
in runners ' tent and @entity162 , a rush to save lives , and limbs from her vantage point view atop the church 's 246 - foot campanile , she witnessed the clouds of smoke and debris that filled @entity7 after the blasts			1
" one of most extraordinary things was watching people down on the ground sorting themselves out , " she said			2
" some people were running literally towards the danger to help people out			2
" the courage i was witnessed from 246 feet up was amazing			0
" now , residents who were directly and indirectly affected by the attack are returning to @entity12 looking for ways to cope with their trauma			1
" i came today to pay my respects after picking up my medal , " said @entity187 , a runner whose race was cut short by the attacks			0
" this is a place that 's usually filled with happiness , especially on @entity195			2
" @entity196 said he planned to return later in the week ; it will be the first time that he will have seen the familiar downtown street since the second explosion ruptured his eardrums and left shrapnel buried deep in his hand			0
" i do n't know what to expect , " said the longtime member of the @entity12			1
" since the attacks , @entity196 has sought counseling like many @entity209			0
" talking with friends , and others like @entity2 , are making me understand that the only way you 're going to get through some of the worst parts of this is by talking , " he said			1
" i think i 've got a lot more talking to do			0
" but for the moment , a lingering trauma has left him still wary of public places			0
" i actually turned down four wonderful @entity222 tickets for saturday night because i 'm not sure that i 'm ready for an open - air crowd just yet , " he said			0
" i 'd have no idea who 's sitting next to me or behind me			2
" after visiting @entity227 " hundreds of times before , " he 's just going to wait			2
" if you think about @entity7 -- if it can happen there , it can happen absolutely anywhere , " he said .			2

minister @entity2 watched from a bell tower as the @entity0 terror attack unfolded
her @entity12 is right next to the marathon 's finish line
the church , like nearby @entity7 shops , has since reopened
it 's a sign @entity0 is returning to normal , but some people still are *anxious*
