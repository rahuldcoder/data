-- for @entity1 , " @entity3 " has transformed into " @entity2			1
" the former was the 23 - year - old 's mission to topple the highest tennis ranking ever held by a @entity8 male , @entity7 , who hit world no. 46 back in july 1992			1
@entity1 smashed through that particular barrier towards the end of 2011 and has enjoyed a formidable few years on @entity12 , beating the likes of @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity8 's rising son now sits in the lofty position of world no. 11 -- his highest ever ranking -- and is tantalizingly poised to gatecrash the top 10			1
but with success comes expectation			0
this surge towards the game 's pinnacle has elevated @entity1 to rock star - like status in his home country , its population clamoring for their first ever grand slam champion			1
" i try not to think too much because if i start thinking then i feel pressure myself , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity32 series			1
" i think people have started thinking about me winning a grand slam or getting to the top ten but it might take some time			0
" i sometimes feel the pressure from a lot of things -- my team , my country , my fans -- but you have to handle it well			2
" my next goal is to win a grand slam			0
hopefully i can do it someday			0
" shot maker a first major could be around the corner if famed tennis coach @entity51 is to be believed			2
@entity1 left @entity8 for @entity51 's @entity53 academy aged just 13 without a grasp of @entity55 , but the intensive work on his game bore fruit within five years as he lifted his first @entity12 title in @entity60			1
according to the man who has coached a phalanx of the game 's greats like @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity69 sisters , @entity1 is " a shot maker			1
" when he 's on , he can beat anybody in the world			2
" @entity14 and @entity15 can testify to that			2
both victories served as proof @entity1 has what it takes to prosper at the game 's top table			2
career landmarks in 2012 he became the first @entity8 player to reach the quarterfinals of the @entity83 in 80 years and then went on to win the @entity84 -- the first home - grown talent to do so in the tournament 's 41 - year history			1
he may have lost to eventual champion @entity88 in the fourth round at this year 's @entity90 , but he was the first @entity8 player to get to that stage since 1938			1
@entity1 clearly relishes testing himself against the best players of what is widely regarded as a golden generation			2
" i love to play against the top ten guys , " he said			0
" beating @entity15 this year and beating @entity14 two years ago -- that is why i am playing tennis , to play those top 10 guys and to beat them			1
" i still have n't beat @entity88 or @entity99 , there are more challenges to come to play those guys			0
" at world no. 11 he is the highest ranked @entity105 male player by a distance -- the next in line is @entity108 from @entity109 in 60th -- and @entity1 wants to blaze a trail like @entity111 who won @entity113 's first ever grand slam at the women 's @entity90 in 2011			1
" i am trying to get to be the most successful player in @entity105 , " @entity1 added			1
" in tennis not many players get to the top 10 -- i think only a few in the past			2
" it 's still weird for me to think i 'm the number one player in @entity105 , because when i was young i could n't think i 'd be the number one player in @entity8 or even @entity105			1
" but now i am and i have to receive it in my mind , my dream is coming and hopefully i can go further			0
i think @entity111 did a great job			0
hopefully i can be the first one to lead the young guys			0
" @entity130 hero @entity1 still refers to @entity15 , whose elegance while accumulating his 17 major titles has seen him described as the greatest the game has ever seen , as his idol			2
no wonder then that @entity1 joked he 'd need a couple of days to celebrate after achieving one of his career goals by beating the @entity139 at the @entity140 in may			2
@entity15 's dominance of men 's tennis was ingrained by the time @entity1 turned professional , but prior to that it was @entity7 he was desperate to emulate			1
" i have two heroes , " he explained			0
" the first one is @entity7 , he was the first ( successful @entity8 player ) -- he was the best tennis player in @entity8			1
still now , even though i love to see him play i think he is really the champion of tennis history			0
" ' @entity149 ' @entity1 's rise saw a swell of optimism that he could be a pioneer for tennis , hence the ' project 45 ' hype as he edged towards usurping @entity7 's ranking			1
" @entity149 was no pressure for me -- i was just playing tennis for my hobby , " he said			0
" my first goal after turning pro was to get into the top 100 and after to be 45			0
it was one of my goals to be number one tennis player in @entity8 , and now i am ranked no. 11 in the world			1
" to get to the top 10 is my next goal			0
it 's not going to be easy to get there -- hopefully this year -- but i am getting close			0
" rock star status like @entity7 , @entity1 has come to understand what being @entity8 's sole representative inside the top 120 means -- fame and adoration			1
much like @entity99 who has had to carry the hopes of the @entity178 on his shoulders , @entity1 has the same weight of responsibility , but answers to double the amount of people			2
" i go back to @entity8 about three or four times a year , " he explained			1
" i get to go back to my home town and , yes , people do recognize me on the streets			2
" it 's not easy sometimes ; you do n't get to relax but at the same time i still try to enjoy the moment			0
not many people can feel that way -- i love to stay in @entity8 , i really enjoy it when i go back			1
" not for a second does he begrudge the accoutrements that his success in the game has delivered			0
he 's just a boy made good from @entity198 acting out his hobby on the global stage			0
" for me , playing tennis was always my hobby , i am a lucky guy , " he said			0
" it was something i loved			0
it is something that can make you mad or crazy sometimes but it is something you love and not many guys can do your job			0
" i try to enjoy this moment and this life -- it is not going to be a long time , 10 to 20 years , so i 'm going to work hard			0
