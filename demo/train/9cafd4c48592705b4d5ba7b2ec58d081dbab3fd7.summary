-- off @entity3 's @entity2 , thousands of dolphins are being slaughtered to be used solely as shark bait -- despite the practice being outlawed by the @entity7 country			1
the @entity10 - based ecologist @entity8 recently recorded one of the hunts in an undercover investigation and released its material			0
on a crisp , sunny day , the group joins a fishing vessel as it goes through rough water riding closer and closer to dusky dolphins swimming under the ship 's bow			2
the crew aims to plunge a harpoon into the pod , assuring it travels all the way through the body of one of the mammals			0
bleeding profusely , the dolphin is hauled on board and almost immediately dies on the deck of the vessel			0
with his sharpened knife , a @entity3 fisherman then peels the skin off the dolphin 's back and carefully cuts the severed body into thin slices			1
even though dolphin killings have been outlawed by @entity3 's legislature since 1996 , @entity39 , executive director of the animal conservation group @entity40 , said fishermen have continued to target the mammals			1
he estimated more than 10,000 dolphins are being killed every year in @entity3 waters			1
@entity48 's white dolphins headed for extinction ? despite the law prohibiting the human consumption and sales of dolphin meat , @entity50 asserts there 's been weak law enforcement and lack of awareness			2
" in recent years , there 's been an upsurge in the targeting of sharks			0
the shark meat is predominantly consumed within @entity3 , but the fins we 're told are being exported to the @entity68 for use as shark fin soup , " said @entity63 , an investigative journalist with the @entity64			1
he witnessed the scene along with cameraman @entity72 who recorded the harpooning of the dolphins			2
@entity63 , in cooperation with the @entity76 , collaborated with @entity40 to conduct the undercover investigation by placing informants aboard the fishing vessels for a week			0
" we were living in very difficult conditions through really quite rough weather and having to eat and sleep for some days actually next to the dismembered carcass of a dolphin			0
it was horrendous , " recounted @entity63			0
he said the vessel he was on was one of hundreds that was out to sea off @entity3 for most of the year targeting sharks			1
the fishing boat captain said all of the boats carry harpoons and aim to target one to three dolphins per trip			2
what 's killing all those dolphins ? @entity100 thinks it 's a virus the fishermen knew the foreigners were journalists and allowed them on board for a week in exchange for fuel money and the protection of their anonymity , although they did n't realize the full scope of their investigation			2
according to @entity40 , violations of these regulations can be punishable with the suspension of concessions , authorizations , permits or licenses for 180 days and one to three years in jail			0
the @entity3 government has promised to investigate charges and is considering banning shark fishing to discourage the use of dolphins as bait			1
" we 're evaluating and if we find out that this is a widespread practice and the fishing of one species is affecting another , then we 're going to take drastic measures			0
that means using tools at our disposal including banning the fishing of certain species as well as the sale of others , " said @entity132 , @entity3 vice minister of fishing			1
when dolphins attack the ban might be difficult considering dolphin hunting has financial incentives			2
the cost of fish bait in @entity3 has also gone up yearly , according to the fisherman			1
it seems to be part of the story around the world , @entity63 said			0
fewer fish in the sea means it costs more money to buy them			2
this is n't just an issue off @entity3 's coast			1
since the video has been released , @entity63 has been contacted by experts in @entity160 who 've told him this practice might also be taking place close to @entity164 waters as well			0
he said it 's hard to know how many dolphins are being killed worldwide because it happens out of sight			1
" it 's a conservation car crash			0
one apex predator being taken out of the ecosystem , being chopped up and fed to catch another , " said @entity63 , " whichever way you look at it , it 's bad news for the ocean			0
" official : ' natural causes ' behind dolphin deaths in @entity3 journalist @entity182 contributed to this report .			1

more than 10,000 dolphins are being killed every year in @entity3 waters
