-- buckle up ! the political conventions in @entity2 and @entity3 over the next two weeks will throw the 2012 election campaigns into high gear , and send it careering down a mean , rocky road toward one of the most important choices @entity10 have made in half a century			2
only twice before in the lives of most voters have we seen an election offering such radically different visions about the role of government in national life			1
the first was 1964 , when @entity20 was holding up the @entity22 standard , calling for government to create a @entity24 with a cornucopia of new federal programs			2
on the other side , @entity27 had seized the @entity30 banner from previously - dominant moderates and crusaded on the most conservative agenda in six decades , seeking to push back not only the @entity24 , but much of the @entity33			1
" extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and ... moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue ! " @entity27 declared to thunderous applause at the @entity30 convention			1
it was a bare - knuckles fight , but @entity20 was campaigning in @entity47 's cloak and @entity27 's proposals were seen as scary and radical			1
@entity20 swept to a crushing victory			0
score one for bigger government			2
the second " choice " election came in 1980 , when , after a decade of failed leadership , a man came galloping out of the @entity55 who seemed the most improbable of figures to get the country going again			1
and he was carrying with him many of @entity27 's ideas			2
but @entity60 turned out to be a strong leader with a million - dollar smile ; @entity63 , a man better suited to be a saint than a politician , went down decisively			2
score one for smaller government			0
this year 's election is shaping up to be a rubber match with major implications for the country 's future			1
gov. @entity73 's choice of @entity74 as his running mate has dialed up the ideological contrast between the two tickets , while both sides have been throwing sharp elbows at each other ( even by the low standards of @entity10 politics )			1
the harshening words and diverging visions speak to an election that breaks somewhat with tradition			1
@entity88 was , as @entity89 at the @entity90 and others have pointed out , the playbook was simple : run to the base in the primary and pivot back to the middle in the general election , winning over as many of the voters in the middle as you can			1
( in economics , this effect is called @entity103 's game and is otherwise normally used to explain why gas stations all seem to be on the same corner			0
) but this election features a small number of genuinely undecided voters -- and high negatives for both party candidates , as @entity111 notes in thursday 's @entity112			1
so , ( although @entity111 would disagree ) the dominant strategy has become playing to the base			0
that explains @entity73 's picking @entity74 , but it also explains why partisans of both sides rejoiced when @entity74 was picked : his strong conservative beliefs fire up the @entity22 base as well as the @entity30 one			1
if anything , this year 's choice is starker than in 1980 : @entity60 had a pragmatic streak , so he was willing to compromise to get a deal done and keep moving forward ( @entity126 used to say that the @entity127 would win more than half a loaf and come back for the rest later )			1
@entity73 and @entity74 , however , reinforced by the tea party , show no inclination to compromise			0
on the @entity22 side , aides to president @entity133 are spreading the word that , if he wins , he has had enough of trying to accommodate the @entity30 and will also be more confrontational			1
whether the two sides will seize upon their conventions to set forth more complete , detailed plans for the next four years remains to be seen			0
so far , they have refused to go beyond vagaries and harsh , trivial attacks on each other			0
most voters are yearning for more courage and less bile			0
but there should be no doubt that the two tickets stand behind radically different visions of the role of government and individuals			1
under president @entity133 , federal spending is now 24 % of @entity154 , far higher than in recent decades			0
while @entity133 talks of trimming , his most thoughtful advisers think the government is likely to grow in coming years no matter who wins ( see @entity162 's provocative column in the @entity163 this week )			2
in contrast , @entity73 has vowed to get federal spending down to 20 %			0
that difference may not sound like much , but it roughly equates to over half a trillion dollars each year			0
at a time when 10,000 @entity168 are becoming eligible for @entity169 and @entity170 each day , going from 24 % to 20 % of @entity154 would mean massive cuts			0
presented with a stark choice between bigger government and smaller government , where are voters likely to come down ? that is a question that has interested scholars for a long time			1
some years ago , political scientists @entity179 and @entity181 observed that @entity10 were " philosophical conservatives " but " operational liberals , " that is , they would tell pollsters they wanted to keep government small , taxes down and socialism out			1
but when asked if they wanted the government to spend more on programs and benefits , they were all for it			0
in the coming election , we may have finally reached a point of reckoning between these two conflicting impulses			2
and so , while conventions are generally the place for sweeping statements , the winning ticket will need to be able to speak operationally as well as philosophically			0
all this makes for a dramatic series of addresses , not just from @entity73 and president @entity133 , but from their parties ' top messengers : people like @entity206 gov. @entity205 and @entity208 mayor @entity207			0
these conventions will offer them a chance to make a firm case to the @entity10 people on which kind of government , both operationally and philosophically , they should choose			0
looming over that choice is the question of whether , at the end of this campaign , the winner can actually govern			2
certainly , the raucous , often vicious nature of the combat so far has not been encouraging			0
one of us ( @entity224 ) has been attending conventions for some 40 years and has witnessed a distinct change in tone ; listening to the hot rhetoric in both conventions in 2004 , it suddenly became comprehensible how the country could have wound up in @entity231 back in 1861 after another election full of ramifications for the nation 's future			2
and the chasms between the two parties continue to widen before us			0
a deeply illuminating study , released a few days ago by the @entity90 and the @entity239 , has shown that over the past 14 years , the percentages of @entity22 and @entity30 who consider themselves " strong partisans " has shot up by about 20 points in each case			2
so , in pushing voters to make a choice between sharply different visions , it is also imperative that the candidates look beyond november to the next four years , figuring out how they will bring the country together again when the brawl is over			1
the acceptance speeches are not just a moment to rally the base , they are also a place to begin laying the foundations of a successful presidency			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 and @entity262 .			1

@entity261 , @entity262 : @entity30 convention jump - starts general election
they say it 's a " choice " election , presenting radically different visions about government 's role
**writers** : election breaks tradition , not pivoting to center for general , but staying with base
**writers** : vote may force voters reckoning with stark question : big government or small ?
