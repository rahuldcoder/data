he and @entity7 have left a huge legacy to the world			0
" @entity19 died in 2009			0
the @entity3 were punk well before punk rock came along			1
at a time when even hard rock bands were putting forth a little peace and love , the @entity3 were brash , forthright and polarizing , relying on the brute force of power chords and @entity5 's peanut - butter - smearing antics to establish a core of followers			1
" taking their cue from the over-amplified pounding of @entity41 blues , the primal raunch of @entity34 garage rock , and the psychedelic rock ( as well as the audience - baiting ) of the @entity37 , the @entity3 were raw , immediate , and vulgar , " @entity30 wrote on @entity31			1
@entity5 told @entity0 in 2010 that the sound happened partly by accident			1
the band was a little too " studious " in the early days , but after their manager " pulled the plug on our rehearsal room , " in @entity5 's telling , the singer started stalking the manager around the place			1
pop 's anger rubbed off on the @entity1 brothers			2
" when i did that , they played differently			0
@entity7 and @entity1 started playing really furiously , and we were rocking , " he recalled			2

the band was n't immune to its own behavior			0
the albums did n't sell , and drug abuse took its toll			0
after " @entity82 , " the @entity3 broke up , and @entity1 joined several other bands			1
