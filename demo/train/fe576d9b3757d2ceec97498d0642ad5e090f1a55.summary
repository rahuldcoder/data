-- the year is almost out of here , and boy has it been a whopper			1
no , we do n't mean the economy or politics			2
we 're talking about the ups and downs of @entity11 celebrities			2
for some , 2013 has been an amazing year filled with all the good things fame can bring : fans , sales and awards			1
for others , not so much			2
the less fortunate have had to deal with criticism , lawsuits and blaring headlines			2
here are five stars who rocked it out in 2013 -- and five who had the rock fall on them : @entity25 @entity25 may not have been named @entity26 , but for a minute there it seemed possible			1
at one point @entity25 was leading in an online poll for the coveted title , but ultimately the magazine 's editors chose @entity34 ( thank @entity35 , right ? )			1
yet even without the honor , it 's hard to dispute the obvious : @entity25 kind of owned 2013			1
her scantily clad performance with singer @entity40 at the 2013 @entity41 in august had everyone talking , and spawned everything from infographics to @entity45 costumes			2
" you can call @entity25 a lot of things after her bizarre 2013 , but poor , uneventful and un-newsworthy are n't some of them , " wrote @entity46 for @entity47			1
" in one of the most calculated exercises in @entity54 , @entity25 schooled major brands by understanding that it is not just about becoming the dialog , but orchestrating it and the ecosystem that surrounds it			1
" much like her @entity62 character @entity61 , @entity25 seemed to emerge in 2013 as two different people			1
one , the young woman crazy in love with her gorgeous ( now - ex ) fiance @entity67 , and the other an edgy singer who hung out with rappers and twerked in a unicorn onsie			2
( you can probably thank @entity25 for the fact that you even know what " twerking " is despite the dance style having been around for years			1
) and she did n't stop there			2
the video for her ode to heartbreak , " @entity85 , " featured a nude @entity25 swinging on a wrecking ball , showing the singer suggestively licking a sledgehammer			1
in november she lit up what appeared to be a joint on stage at the 2013 @entity90 , performed alongside a crying kitten at the @entity92 , and she was one of only three female solo artists in 2013 to debut an album with more than 150,000 copies sold ( @entity96 and @entity97 were the other two )			2
@entity25 charmed while hosting " @entity98 " ; her cache allowed her to celebrate her 21st birthday by " taking over " @entity41 for the day , and her more than 15 million @entity102 followers are happy to retweet her candid photos of anything and everything , including the singer in bed and kissing her dog			1
@entity25 may be the most visible , but she 's not the only celebrity to have a big year			1
there is also : @entity111 the former boy bander had the biggest album of the year , " the 20/20 experience , " which sold 968,000 copies when it debuted in march , held the no. 1 position for weeks and followed that with a second volume , " @entity118 " last month			1
he joined the elite " @entity123 " of hosts for " snl , " and his history of rap performances with @entity121 are viral gold			2
@entity111 's " reunion " with ' @entity130 at the @entity131 almost exploded the @entity125 , and he toured with the equally cool @entity126 , and did we mention he continued to bring sexy back by looking adorable the whole entire time ? @entity132 her success in 2013 was , dare we say , " scandal " - ous			2
not only does she star on one of the hottest tv shows of the year , but she also graced countless magazine covers , was named best dressed by people and was the @entity140 " it " girl of the season			1
@entity142 also managed to pull off a secret marriage , keep her pregnancy under wraps and host " snl " during a firestorm of controversy regarding the comedy show 's lack of diversity			2
@entity152 do n't you just love her ? @entity154 has continued to build a reputation as incredibly approachable and just downright cool			0
whether it 's giving the best quotes during interviews or inspiring amazing gifs , she is helping to shape pop culture			0
along the way she also starred in " @entity163 : catching @entity165 , " one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited films of the year , and " @entity164			1
" we are n't the only ones enthralled by the actress : @entity170 selected her as one of the 10 most fascinating people of 2013			0
@entity174 @entity174 continued to be @entity176 's sweetheart			0
she was equally comfortable in the pages of @entity178 as she was dressed up for @entity45 with son @entity179			0
early buzz has her pegged as an @entity183 contender for " gravity			0
" she also scored with lighter fare such as the female buddy - cop film " @entity187 " with @entity188			0
and how many movie stars know the lyrics to the classic hip - hop tune " @entity191 " ? while these celebrities enjoyed a great year , there are a few who did n't fare as well : @entity195 the poster child for a not - so - great 2013 would have to be @entity195			1
where to begin even ? it seemed like he stayed in the news with everything from losing his monkey to a car accident and a run - in with a neighbor			0
there was also lots of speculation about his time spent in @entity210			0
to pull it all together for you , we prepared a guide to @entity195 's bad year			1
@entity215 @entity215 easily assumed the mantle of troubled starlet that @entity218 had previously owned			0
@entity215 had quite a bit of legal trouble and some bizarre tweets in which she attacked fellow celebs			0
@entity223 penned a letter of support			0
after being placed on a psychiatric hold , she eventually went into treatment and now appears to be on the mend			0
@entity218 speaking of @entity218 , her " comeback " fell kind of flat			0
the @entity231 painted a less than flattering portrait of her on the set of " @entity235 " which , despite having an actual porn star acting opposite her , failed to generate much heat ( the @entity238 passed on it )			0
even what was billed as a super confessional interview with @entity241 did n't seem to get people very excited about her and her career			0
@entity245 it should have been a great year for @entity247 and @entity248			1
a new baby and an engagement and a new album for him			0
but the pair spent 12 months being raked over the coals from the body shaming of @entity247 's pregnant body to further shaming after she lost weight and posted a selfie of her ample curves in a revealing bathing suit			0
meanwhile , @entity248 seemed to court contention every time he opened his mouth -- be it comparing @entity247 to @entity264 or deeming himself the @entity266 rock star on the planet			1
it got so bad that people wanted to believe @entity248 really said he was " the next @entity270 , " but even he would n't say that			0
and let 's not forget that now notorious music video			0
@entity275 there is probably little sympathy for @entity275 for landing on the list of those who had a bad year			1
the singer has never fully rebounded from pleading guilty to assaulting his then - girlfriend , @entity280 , in 2009			0
many did n't know what to make of it when the pair briefly reconciled in 2013			0
@entity275 was booked on a hit - and - run charge in july that was later dropped , and in october was accused of assaulting a man in @entity142			1
@entity275 later entered rehab to deal with anger management issues and consequently was kicked out for " acting violently			1
" here 's to continued success for those who did well and a better 2014 for those who did n't .			0
