-- a sharply taken goal was followed by a celebration which showed he also has a sense of humor			0
@entity6 scored the crucial opener in @entity9 's 4 - 0 rout of @entity10 saturday to take them seven points clear in the @entity13 -- then faked as if he was an old man with a bad back , using the corner flag as a walking stick			1
maybe it was in reaction to his manager @entity19 's unguarded comments to a @entity22 tv channel last month			0
the @entity23 apparently questioned the age of the @entity26 star , who is 33 later this week , as well as making unflattering reference to the other strikers at @entity9			2
perhaps it has acted as unintentional motivation , but @entity6 showed his old qualities as he latched on to @entity33 's clumsy back pass and calmly beat @entity34 to put @entity9 ahead just after half time			1
moments later @entity6 raced on to @entity35 's through ball and went quickly to ground under challenge from @entity39			2
referee @entity40 pointed to the spot and compounded @entity10 's anger by sending off @entity39			2
hazard converted from the spot and @entity6 's work was essentially done , being replaced by @entity46 , but earning a pat on the back from @entity19			2
he had only earned his place in the starting line up when @entity51 injured himself in the warm - up and @entity19 told @entity53 , that it was " fate " that he later scored his seventh @entity13 goal of the season			2
" i think he 's amazing			0
the way he copes with the situation in the last couple of weeks , i think he 's fantastic			0
and today i told him before the game : ' you are going to score for sure			0
' " @entity10 's part in their own downfall , looking comfortable until @entity66 's disastrous error after a slip , was summed up by @entity9 's two late goals			1
@entity69 also slipped to allow @entity46 to score a rare @entity13 goal this term and he doubled his tally and made it 4 - 0 after he intercepted @entity74 's careless header			1
@entity10 manager @entity75 was left shaking his head in disbelief , @entity19 had a spring in his step after a victory which left them clear of second - placed @entity81 and nine points ahead of @entity83 , who have three games in hand			1
@entity75 launched a post-match tirade against his team , whose chances of @entity91 football have all but disappeared			0
" you ca n't legislate for the capitulation -- you ca n't have that			0
lack of characters , too many of them too nice to each other and you need to show a bit more guts and not want to be someone 's mate all the time , " he said			0
" it hurts me and i wo n't forget about this when we hit the motorway , but some might , " he added			0
earlier , @entity108 kept their slim hopes of @entity91 qualification alive with a 3 - 0 win over @entity112 at the @entity113			1
goals from @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 gave @entity108 a second straight league win , while @entity119 's @entity112 remained a point above the drop zone after the home defeat			1
" i thought our forward play was very good , " under - pressure @entity108 manager @entity123 told @entity124			1
third - placed @entity127 were involved in @entity129 quarterfinal action saturday and beat @entity130 4 - 1 at the @entity131 to book a last four match at @entity133			1
the match hinged on the award of a penalty to the home side in the second half with the scores tied at 1 - 1			1
@entity140 was tripped by @entity141 and @entity142 converted from the spot			0
@entity144 came off the bench for the home side to add gloss to the scoreline with two late goals as @entity130 pushed for an equalizer			2
@entity151 had put @entity127 ahead before @entity152 leveled for the visitors .			0

@entity9 *stretch* lead at top of @entity13
@entity6 stars in 4 - 0 win over @entity10
@entity108 win 3 - 0 at @entity112 to ease pressure on manager @entity123
@entity127 through to @entity129 *semifinal* with 4 - 1 win over @entity130
