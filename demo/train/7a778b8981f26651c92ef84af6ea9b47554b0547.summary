@entity0 -- colleges are n't getting any cheaper , but federal student loans are			0
students who graduate with college loan debt can use a repayment plan that will give lower monthly payments			1
millions of borrowers will get a better deal on their student loans based on federal rules that went into effect wednesday			2
lower interest rates and loan forgiveness in some cases are some of the rules that will make borrowing cheaper for many students			1
also among the rules : an income - based repayment program that considers income and family size			1
the program allows borrowers to set their monthly loan payment at 15 percent of their annual adjusted gross income			1
under the traditional 10 - year plan , a borrower who graduated with $ 25,000 in student loan debt and whose income is $ 30,000 a year would pay $ 288 a month at an interest rate of 6.8 percent , according to the the @entity33 's web site			1
now , the student could opt for payments of $ 172 a month spread over a longer time			0
borrowers can apply the plan to their remaining loan amount as of wednesday			2
single borrowers who earn less than $ 16,245 -- the poverty level -- would not be required to make any payments on their federal loans as long as their income remained that low			0
payments would be significantly lower under the income - based plan , but loans would take longer than the standard 10 years to repay			1
that could increase overall interest costs for borrowers			0
proponents argue that for some it is well worth the tradeoff by making lower - paying jobs more appealing			2
" just imagine all those people that went to college and had expectations of a good job market and now it 's not so hot , " said deputy undersecretary @entity55 of the @entity56 @entity33			0

borrowers who work for 10 years in a public service job , such as public school education or the military , will have the remainder of their federal loans forgiven after that decade ends			2
graduates must pay monthly loan bills during those 10 years and can use the income - based plan to lock in lower payments			1
the government counts work from october 2 , 2007 onward , @entity55 said			0
thus , the earliest a borrower can have loans forgiven is october 2 , 2017			0
also providing relief to borrowers are a lowered interest rate , increase in @entity96 for current students and a reduced loan origination fee			1
the government cut the interest rate from 6 percent to 5.6 percent			0
payouts of @entity96 , which allow students to borrow less , increased by $ 619 to $ 5,350 for the 2009 - 2010 school year			2
loan origination fees decreased from 2 percent to 1.5 percent and will fall to 1 percent next july , @entity55 said			0
congressional democrats pushed the income - based plan , public service program and decrease in loan interest rates , all signed into law by former president @entity111 under the @entity112 and @entity113			1
president @entity115 's stimulus bill supported the increase in @entity96			1
