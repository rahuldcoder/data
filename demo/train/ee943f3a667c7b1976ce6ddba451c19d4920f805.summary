-- two bushfires still rage out of control in southeast @entity3 , high heat and strong winds persist and scores are coming to grips with the destruction causes by the flames that have already rushed through			1
yet , for all the tears shed thus far , the news could be worse			2
" it 's been a nightmare , " @entity12 told @entity13 , a @entity0 affiliate			1
" i just go along with what happens			0
" at least i 'm still alive			1
i realize i 'm very lucky to be alive			1
" wildfires that tore through tens of thousands of hectares on the island off @entity21 's southern coast destroyed more than 100 homes , but they have n't caused any known deaths , according to police and local officials			1
" we 've had no reports of fatalities at this stage , " @entity27 mayor @entity26 told @entity0 affiliate @entity28 early monday			1
@entity26 's territory includes @entity35 , where about 65 homes and an elementary school were destroyed friday in addition to dozens more homes and businesses in neighboring communities , authorities said			1
acting @entity3 police commissioner @entity43 likewise said monday that authorities have n't found any indication anyone died in the fires			1
but he said they are still continuing to sift through about 500 inquiries -- some of whom may be for the same person or be for people who were n't even in the fire zones -- about potentially missing people			0
then there 's the matter of double - checking on the ground , including combing through scorched buildings , to ensure everyone survived			1
" until we 've had the opportunity to do all the screening that we need to do , ... we ca n't say for certain that there has n't been a human life or more than one human life lost as a result of these fires , " @entity43 told reporters			0
some -- like @entity12 , who arrived with nothing more than a toothbrush and the clothes he was wearing -- found refuge in the prison - turned - tourist attraction in @entity77			0
there , they have been given meals and other necessities			0
they 've also found plenty of company in their heartbreak			0
" apparently , it 's burnt out , " @entity85 said of his house			1
" but it 's home , no matter what it 's like			2
" back in @entity35 , @entity91 and his sons drove through the flames to escape , only to return later to find their homes and the timber mill they once owned scorched			0
@entity96 , one of the sons , said the family is trying to figure out how to tell the people who worked there that the mill may not come back			0
" how do you tell somebody that ? " @entity91 told @entity13			0
" i do n't know			0
" while this town already has been decimated , others remained in danger monday			2
according to a monday morning update from the @entity110 , " watch and alert " advisories have been issued for a pair of fires that have already collectively burned about 29,000 hectares ( 110 square miles )			2
as of that time -- and despite some progress overnight -- neither of those bushfires was under control			0
" although there has been a decrease in weather conditions and fire activity overnight and this morning , people need to remain vigilant , as fire and weather conditions can change rapidly , " the service said for the larger of the two blazes , known as the @entity120			2
@entity128 was n't helping much monday , where high temperatures in the most affected areas are expected to reach 30 degrees @entity132 ( 86 degrees @entity133 ) , according to the @entity134			1
the same forecast for southeast @entity3 called for daytime winds of 20 to 30 kph ( 12 to 19 mph ) , slowly slightly by evening			1
cooler temperatures are likely and isolated rain showers are possible for tuesday and wednesday , though winds could also intensify on those days			0
@entity21 prime minister @entity140 visited the fire - stricken area monday , later talking about those who " lost so much but ( are not ) able to see it " themselves and others " who wanted to do something as simple as go on a family holiday have had to confront the forces of nature at work			1
" " to all of those people , i do want to say we 're thinking of you in these moments of grief and despair , and we will be working with you in the days to come , " she said			0
aerial photographs taken earlier by @entity13 showed the fire 's fury as it hopscotched homes in @entity35 and @entity163 , burning two homes , leaving one standing and then burning another			2
@entity3 's fire chief told reporters sunday that firefighters hope to bring the blaze under control by tuesday			1
part of the problem is the rugged nature of the @entity175 -- in the southeast part of island -- where the fires have been burning since last week , chief fire officer @entity171 said sunday			0
" there ( are ) still some problems getting fire vehicles into the @entity175 to work more on protecting properties and protecting assets , '' he said			0
@entity0 's @entity184 contributed to this report .			2
