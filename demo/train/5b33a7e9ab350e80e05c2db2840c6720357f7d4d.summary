-- wealthy wannabes and 24 - carat gold millionaires mingled at the @entity4 's @entity3 after party , sunday			1
@entity7 race winner @entity6 will have found his name top of the guest list for the post-race poolside soiree at the @entity11 , which overlooks the circuit 's famous hairpin			1
the club , presided over by former @entity16 and @entity17 team boss @entity15 , is designed to serve up a neat cocktail of all that the @entity20 race weekend has come to represent -- racing , glamor , hedonism and wealth			1
" this is a dream for lots of people for one night , " @entity15 told @entity0			2
" the moment you 're in , you are a vip for us			0
" it makes no difference if you 're the top actor in @entity35 or wherever , for us everybody is the same			0
" @entity15 's @entity38 brand is selling a luxury lifestyle and the historic race around the principality -- a playground for the rich and famous -- is the perfect backdrop for some of the world 's estimated 1,645 billionaires to blow off steam			1
" billionaires and the ultra-wealthy cross the globe like migratory birds and @entity54 is one of the key events , " @entity48 , president of wealth intelligence firm @entity49 , explained to @entity0			2
" there is a cultural template in racing			0
if you contrast @entity61 with @entity63 for example , where the origins really came from running moonshine across state lines during the @entity68 , the dna of @entity61 is so different			2
" @entity15 agreed : " everybody wants to be at this race from the sponsors to the celebrities			1
the @entity4 is the center of this event , this party and all this celebrity			1
" all the drivers are there sunday night , " he promised			0
after attending sunday 's royal grand prix gala dinner , hosted by @entity54 's @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity6 , who was raised in @entity54 , might have opted to head home to his @entity20 pad for an early night			1
for others the midnight to dawn party at the billionaire @entity88 kept on swinging			0
the evening promised world - famous djs , special performances and inestimable bottles of champagne to quench the thirst of revelers			0
the @entity4 , which stages a four - day fiesta in @entity54 , aims to emulate a billionaire lifestyle , but that does not mean you have to have billions in the bank to get in			2
" if he 's a billionaire but he 's a billionaire that spends no money -- we are not interested ! " @entity15 quipped			1
" the name was a kind of provocative name so everyone can remember			0
you do n't need to be a billionaire			0
" it is not a rip - off , it 's the same price as everything else in @entity54 , nothing dramatic			0
" the club may not be for billionaires per se but it does have a minimum spending policy			0
the price starts from $ 4,000 for a standard table			0
the majority of tables at the @entity54 event are reserved for @entity4 members and returning guests with 10 % held back for what @entity15 describes as " last - minute friends			1
" the club also has another reputation , also synonymous with @entity61 , for attracting beautiful girls			1
it employs 20 girls to act as ambassadors , welcoming guests and circulating on the dance floor			0
the 64 - year - old is almost as famous for dating supermodels -- he counts @entity139 and @entity140 among his exes -- as he is for his motorsport career			0
" last year , the @entity143 told me that he 'd never seen so many good - looking girls and good - looking guys in one club in his life ! " @entity15 proudly explained			1
but are looks really another prerequisite for the @entity4 's @entity54 guests ? " i do n't care about physically beautiful if people dress up elegant , " said @entity15 , who gained early success franchising @entity16 clothing stores in the @entity35 " if somebody is tall , somebody is short , somebody is fat , somebody is skinny ... the people try their best to look very , very good			1
" the @entity3 may be a honey pot for the beautiful and famous -- @entity161 creator @entity160 , actor @entity162 and pop sensation @entity163 all turned up for the race -- but it is wealth and influence that grease the wheels of @entity61			1
powerful global brands such as @entity170 , @entity7 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 are intrinsic to the millions and millions of dollars required to run an @entity61 team			1
the 19 grands prix on the sport 's globetrotting calendar can be as significant as boardrooms for striking business deals			0
" so many of the sport 's sponsors are high end brands , " explains @entity48			0
" @entity61 has created this whole ecosystem of luxury brands , investors , ultra-wealthy individuals and fast cars			2
" most members of the @entity4 just want to have fun into the small hours but some will undoubtedly be mixing business with pleasure in @entity54			2
" we do n't ask what their job is , " says @entity15 of the estimated 4,000 guests who attended his bash in @entity20			1
" sure it 's a lot of business people and a lot of wealthy people			0
" there are multiple languages spoken in the @entity4 with international people from @entity205 , @entity35 , @entity206 and @entity207 -- it 's crazy			1
" movers and shakers do not have it all their own way in @entity54			0
believe it or not , it is possible to party in @entity20 on a budget			1
when the race is run , partygoers can simply carry a bottle of beer and a fromage baguette straight on the circuit , raising a toast to the race winner at the @entity225 corner or along the rim of @entity227			2
even high roller @entity15 recognizes there is a market for the billionaire lifestyle on a budget			2
for the 2014 @entity3 , he launched @entity233 , a lounge bar , club and restaurant , with an open door policy and free entry to most of its events			1
" everybody wants to be a billionaire for one night , " he declared			0
" including me ! " interactive : @entity0 's guide to the 2014 @entity61 season			2
