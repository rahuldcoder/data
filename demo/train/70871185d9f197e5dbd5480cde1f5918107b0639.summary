-- people with a stable mood and better capacity to handle stressful situations without anxiety have a reduced risk of developing dementia , according to a study published this week in the journal @entity10			1
stress can increase the risk of dementia in older people , a study has found			1
this finding was particularly strong in highly extroverted people , the study said			2
subjects who were both socially active and not easily stressed had the lowest risk for dementia			1
but even socially isolated individuals who were more calm and self - satisfied showed a reduced likelihood of dementia , the study said			1
extroverted people usually have more optimistic outlooks on life , and " may be better equipped to cope with stressful events and therefore less prone to depression , " said @entity28 of the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , and lead author of the study			2
the study looked at 506 older people from the @entity36 in @entity30 who did not have dementia at the first examination			1
these people then filled out questionnaires that determined their personality types and level of social activity			0
those who said they were easily distressed were classified as having high neuroticism			0
researchers followed these participants for six years , during which time 144 of them developed dementia			0
although it is not easy to change someone 's personality , " the good news of our finding is that an active lifestyle -- having a rich social network and participating in physical , mental and social activities -- may buffer the negative effect of high neuroticism on dementia risk , " @entity28 said			2
one in seven @entity57 age 71 and older , or about 3.4 million , have dementia , according to the @entity58			1
in this age - group , 2.4 million people have alzheimer 's disease , @entity58 research has shown			1
alzheimer 's disease is the most common cause of dementia , according to the @entity65			0
previous research has documented that personality factors may play a role in how people cope with dementia			0
this study is unique in that it looks at a combination of different lifestyle and personality traits , said dr. @entity74 , professor of clinical neurology at @entity75 , who was not involved with the study			0
@entity74 and colleagues have found that people with higher educational or occupational attainment , or who engage in leisure activities , appear less demented			0
they call this concept " cognitive reserve , " because these lifestyle factors seem to allow them to cope with the pathology of the disease better			0
that is , as the disease progresses in the brain , those who have a greater " reserve " do not show symptoms of @entity94 's -- memory loss and impairment of day - to - day functions -- as quickly			1
mounting evidence suggests that lifestyle factors also directly influence brain changes , he said			0
the @entity31 study builds off the established idea in the field that stress actually harms the brain			0
the pathology of dementia appears about 10 to 15 years before a person actually develops alzheimer 's disease , @entity74 said			2
that means , just like a man with prostate cancer may not have any symptoms , a person 's brain may have undergone changes that lead to @entity94 's without visibly affecting a person 's day - to - day life			1
doctors can look for indications of the disease using positron emission tomography ( @entity124 ) scans			0
a chemical called @entity126 is used in the imaging of brain tissues to find signatures of @entity94 's -- namely , beta - amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles			1
" the working idea is that if we can detect it before it 's clinically expressed and stop it then , we can prevent people from developing the disease , " @entity74 said .			2

study : less - stressed older individuals had lower risk of developing dementia
3.4 million @entity57 age 71 and older have some form of dementia
some people do not show symptoms of @entity94 's but have pathology
