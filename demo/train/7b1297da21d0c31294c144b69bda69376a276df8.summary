-- mobile technology is critical at the airport			2
yet , a new survey shows that most travelers ( 58 % ) are not satisfied with airport @entity5			1
and beyond that , airports are missing opportunities to offer vital mobile services that could vastly improve travelers ' experiences while they 're in transit			1
this 2,700 - person survey was conducted earlier this year by @entity15 , which makes a popular app that provides flight and airport information			2
the survey shows mobile devices frequently accompany travelers : four out of five airport travelers use a smartphone , one - third use tablets and one - fifth use e-readers			1
surprisingly , fewer than one in five travelers reported using a laptop computer at the airport			2
@entity15 predicts that by next year tablets will outnumber laptops at the airport			0
as a frequent traveler , i 'm often frustrated by how little my smartphone and @entity36 can help me at the airport			0
sometimes it seems like the airports and airlines want to thwart me			0
some airports charge fees through third - party providers ( like @entity44 or @entity45 ) simply to get @entity5 access -- and entering my credit card number over an open @entity5 network makes me shudder			1
citing a recent @entity51 story , @entity15 reports : " many airports , including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , are actually choosing customer satisfaction over ancillary revenue opportunities -- by providing airport visitors with free @entity5 access			1
" once you manage to get on the airport @entity5 , access is often spotty and slow			1
many airports force travelers to sit through a video commercial or other ads before they will let you access the @entity67			2
worse , some airports insist on placing a " frame " around your web browser window with airport - related ads , limiting valuable screen real estate			2
that 's annoying on a laptop ; it 's intolerable on a small cell phone screen			0
speaking of cell phones , airports are huge facilities that , i 've found , often have cell phone " dead zones " -- even for major carriers like @entity83			0
i 'm surprised that wireless carriers do n't seem to be making a concerted effort to ensure good data network coverage at airports , especially at airports with lousy , unreliable , or paid @entity5 access			1
imagine the effectiveness of their ads displayed in those locations ! one of the main things travelers want information about is the airport itself			0
unfortunately , @entity15 estimates that only half of @entity101 airports currently have mobile - friendly websites			1
when your plane 's about to board and you 're trying desperately to find which gate your flight was switched to ( because the announcement over the public address system was , of course , unintelligible ) , that 's not when you want to be pinching , zooming , and scrolling on your phone			0
what do mobile users want at the airport ? according to @entity15 , the overwhelming majority ( 94 % ) want flight status and gate information pushed promptly to their phones			2
also , nearly three - fourths want boarding alerts sent to their mobile device			1
nearly 40 % would like mobile coupons for restaurants and shops on the terminal and concourses , and about 30 % would like information on easily accessible food and beverages			0
more than one - third of travelers also want to be able to book ground transportation via mobile , and nearly as many would like to use their mobile devices to share flight information easily via social media , text and e-mail , the survey found			1
nearly two - thirds of travelers told @entity15 that they would value mobile access to walking directions from to their departure gate , especially when changing planes on a connecting flight			1
demand for this service is highest among leisure travelers ( 71 % ) , who are often less familiar with the layout of the airport			0
personally , i 'd also appreciate estimates on the time it will take to walk to my next gate			0
at @entity157 , especially , i 've ended up jogging for the better part of a mile , carry - on bag in tow , on more than one occasion			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity165 .			0
