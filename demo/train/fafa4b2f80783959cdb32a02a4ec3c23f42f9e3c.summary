@entity1 , @entity0 -- opposition groups in @entity0 are upset with @entity5 's choice for a new prime minister , saying the decision should have been made in a different way			1
@entity9 , spokesman for the @entity10 , said the appointment of @entity12 was a surprise			1
" the change we demanded should have been done through the formation of a national unity government headed by an agreed - upon personality , and then holding early elections , and setting a new law for democratic elections , " he said			2
in appointing @entity12 on tuesday , @entity5 instructed the new government to take " practical , swift and tangible steps to launch a real political reform process			1
" he said a new election law would be the " main pillar of political development			0
" opposition parties -- especially the @entity28 -- are demanding that parliament , not the king , choose the government			0
but it has always been the prerogative of @entity0 's king to dismiss and appoint governments			1
@entity9 said @entity12 's previous term as prime minister had seen election fraud , and the @entity10 had not been allowed to take part in political life			1
@entity39 , an influential figure in the @entity28 movement in @entity0 , said @entity12 was " not a man of reforms , and so he should stop all plans to form the new government			1
" another opposition figure , @entity44 of the @entity45 , said experience with @entity12 was not positive , but the party would wait to see what reforms were proposed			2
street protests across @entity0 in recent weeks have focused on demands for a more open political process , as well as economic grievances			0
fuel and food prices in @entity0 have risen sharply in recent months , reflecting higher world prices for wheat and oil			0
