-- former astronaut @entity1 is one of the privileged few to have walked on the moon , but he hopes space tourism will be much more of an equal - opportunity experience			1
more than 40 years after the historic moon landing , @entity1 is now consulting for the @entity8 government about the future of the country 's space program and how to make space more accessible to everyday people			1
@entity14 has driven space exploration for decades , but with the rise of @entity19 , @entity20 and other companies that focus on suborbital flights , the private sphere and government programs are appearing to intersect in the realm space travel			1

when this question was discussed 25 years ago , @entity1 says , an obvious answer was to offer the flights to the highest bidders			1
" but somebody in the back of the room said , ' how about a lottery ? ' man , my ears perked up at that , and i became a devotee of a lottery to select people , " he says			0

even for the man who has logged more than 280 hours in space and has literally seen the world , the inconvenience of earthly travel can still get to him -- most of all , the airport security checks			2
it is perhaps fitting that @entity1 continues to explore , and not on land either , instead voyaging underwater with scuba gear			2
