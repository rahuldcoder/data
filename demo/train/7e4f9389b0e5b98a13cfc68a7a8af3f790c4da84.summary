@entity1 , @entity0 -- call it a case of high tech meeting low tech , really the lowest of tech. satellites are locating penguin waste , which is easier to find than the penguins themselves @entity13 scientists are using pictures from high - powered satellites to pinpoint emperor penguin colonies in @entity17			1
the penguins are difficult to pick up on sea ice , because of their natural camouflage that helps them blend into the shadows -- so the @entity23 had to come up with another method			1
fortunately , penguin waste shows up nicely from space , staining the ice a light brown			1
" we ca n't see actual penguins on the satellite maps because the resolution is n't good enough , " said mapping expert @entity29			2
" but during the breeding season the birds stay at a colony for eight months			0
the ice gets pretty dirty and it 's the guano stains that we can see			0
" the method helped scientists identify 38 penguin colonies -- of those , 10 were new			1
of previously known colonies , six had re-located and six were not found			0
" this is a very exciting development			0
now we know exactly where the penguins are , the next step will be to count each colony so we can get a much better picture of population size , " said penguin ecologist @entity45			2
" using satellite images combined with counts of penguin numbers puts us in a much better position to monitor future population changes over time			2
" estimates put the total number of penguins at between 200,000 and 400,000 breeding pairs .			0

@entity13 scientists are using a new way to pinpoint penguin colonies in @entity17
satellites pick up images of penguin waste as actual penguins can not be seen
the method helped scientists identify 38 penguin colonies -- of those , 10 were new
