-- the bonds we renew in person between friends and family as we visit during the holiday season get reactivated online after we all go home			2
this is the time when feast and @entity9 go hand - in - hand			1
and as it turns out , these two activities are more related than you might imagine			0
two years ago , we published a study in the @entity15 that showed weight gain could spread from one person to others in our real - life social networks			1
when we gain weight , so do people who are one " degree of separation " from us : our friends , siblings , spouses , and co-workers			2
the effect does n't stop there			0
it also spreads to people who are two degrees removed from us , like our friends ' spouses , or our siblings ' co-workers , or our friends ' friends			0
in fact , it even spreads to three degrees of separation , to our friends ' friends ' friends			0
our social networks contain large interconnected clusters of people who gain weight in parallel			1
several social processes might explain the appearance of such clusters			0
one reason might be a kind of social contagion , whereby behaviors or attitudes related to body size flow through the network			0
on the other hand , although a pair of friends might influence each other , they also might choose to be friends with one another because they were similar in the first place			2
or they might both react the same way to something in their environment , like a new doughnut shop down the street			0
teasing these effects apart requires the right kind of data			0
when we followed thousands of people and mapped their social networks over 32 years , we found that obesity can spread from person to person to person			1
today , when people say " social network , " they usually think of @entity9 , @entity86 , or @entity87 , and not necessarily the kinds of real - world networks we studied			1
connection and contagion are so fundamentally rooted in our evolutionary psychology that they carry over even to very modern aspects of our lives -- including e-mail , blogs , and social networking sites			0
alas , our study only went up to 2003 , before online social networks became so popular			1
so a natural question to ask was whether the same clusters of overweight individuals exist online and , if so , under what circumstances			2
we started following a group of over 1,700 interconnected college students on @entity9 about four years ago			2
in addition to all of their personal information and daily status updates and wall posts , we also had a very important resource : their photos			0
although we could not put each of these students on a scale , we could study their photos and develop a systematic way to estimate each student 's weight			0
it 's true that people tend to post only flattering pictures of themselves , but , since everyone does this , we can still get an idea of who is relatively heavier than whom			0
and , it turns out that roughly a quarter of the people in our study were overweight or obese , which is close to the figure for college students nationwide			0
at first , when we analyzed the whole @entity9 network , we were surprised to find no evidence of clustering			2
there did not seem to be any relationship between your weight and the weight of your @entity9 friends			1
but we soon realized that this makes sense			0
our previous work showed that the social contagion of obesity only works between people who have close social relationships			0
even though we may have 1,000 " friends " online , the very tenuousness of these relationships means they may not be as powerful as a single real - world connection			1
so , you probably wo n't gain weight if just any old @entity9 friend does			1
but what about your @entity9 friends who are real friends -- the old - fashioned kind you had over to dinner at @entity162 ? do they affect us ? and how might it be possible to figure out which @entity9 connections are also important , real - world connections ? one idea we had was to use the tagged photos that people share with one another online			1
if you upload a picture of someone , the chances are good that you have a real - world connection with them			1
in fact , while the average student in our sample has over 110 @entity9 friends , they have only six " picture friends , " a number very similar to the number of " close " friends people list when asked in sociology studies			1
it turned out that when we restricted our analysis to " picture friends , " we found evidence that overweight people cluster on @entity9			1
the results suggest that if one of your picture friends is obese , it increases the likelihood that you are obese by 11 percent			1
and , even more remarkably , if a picture friend of your picture friend is overweight , it increases the likelihood you 'll be overweight by 4 percent			0
in other words , we find evidence that clusters of overweight friends extend two degrees of separation on @entity9			1
many processes could underlie this clustering online , just as was the case in the offline world			2
perhaps people are more likely to befriend others who resemble them in terms of body size			0
perhaps groups of online friends share exposures to things that make all of them gain -- or lose -- weight in synchrony			1
or perhaps when one of your close friends online gains weight , you follow suit			2
it is not yet clear which of these processes is occurring , but this is the first evidence we 've seen that suggests the online world may be like the offline world when it comes to body size			0
of course , picture friends and real - life friends are likely to be one and the same			1
in fact , the reason we looked just at picture friends is because we think it is these real - world connections that are most likely to be the paths through which emotions and behaviors are transmitted from person to person to person			1
@entity9 , @entity87 , and @entity86 give us new ways to keep in touch , but in many ways our online networks are really just an extension of the real - world networks that we have all inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years			1
online as well as offline , human beings connect with each other and influence each other , and this influence can spread in a social chain reaction in ever - more - modern ways			2
as you enjoy your festive meals this season , take a moment to consider how truly powerful a real social bond can be			0
the effect of friends and family on your life remains long after the last of the leftovers are eaten			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity274 and @entity275 .			2

@entity274 and @entity275 : during holidays , feast and @entity9 go hand - in - hand .
authors ' study found weight gain can spread via real - life social networks
*writers* say @entity9 and other online networks mimic those in real world
study of " picture friends " on @entity9 *reflected* same clustering of overweight pals
