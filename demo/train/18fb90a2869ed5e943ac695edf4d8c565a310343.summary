@entity0 -- the @entity2 appeared cautiously willing to uphold its decades - old precedent giving labor unions the power to collect dues for collective bargaining from public sector workers , even those who choose not to join the union			1
that could avoid a major political upheaval in the national labor movement			0
but a number of justices indicated tuesday during oral arguments they may rule more narrowly on the case at hand -- and exempt some home - care health providers from being designated " state employees " and forced under @entity22 law to pay those fees			1
it is an economic and legal issue sharply dividing the business community and its allies on one side -- with the unions , some states , and the @entity32 administration on the other			2
at issue is whether the free speech and association rights of non-union personal assistants are being violated when @entity22 negotiates exclusively with the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) over wages , hours and working conditions			1
the court , as usual , went ahead with its public session despite the rest of the federal government shut down because of the winter weather			0
three separate oral arguments took place into the afternoon			0
the justices almost never cancel them , operating largely on their own schedule , apart from the rest of official @entity0			2
all members of the court were present , and even retired justice @entity54 watched attentively from the sidelines as a spectator in the crowded courtroom			0
it 's called the ' agency shop ' lawyers from both sides faced sometimes withering questioning from the bench			0
" i 'm just going to use the word here , it is a radical argument , " justice @entity64 told the attorney for the non-union employees			1
" it would radically restructure the way workplaces across this country are run			0
" but justice @entity74 said the free speech aspect was important , such as the debate over negotiating the size of the government workforce			0
" i 'm talking about whether or not a union can take money from an employee who objects to the union 's position on fundamental political grounds			2
i 'm asking the justification for that under the @entity88 , " he said			0
" in an era where government is getting bigger and bigger , this is becoming more and more of an important issue to more people			0
" the @entity2 has issued a series of incremental rulings over the decades			0
no worker can be forced to join a union , but the justices have recognized labor organizations carry a legal obligation to represent all employees			1
under the " agency shop " dynamic , that means the non-union workforce must still pay their " fair share " for the costs of negotiating and administering binding contracts with the company			2
the theory is that all benefit from the fruits of collective bargaining , and that allowing individual workers to opt of the contribution -- for financial , personal , or ideological reasons -- would offer no incentive for anyone to pay the fair share fees , called " free riding			1
" and the high court has said that arrangement can be important to maintain a stable workforce and " industrial peace			0
" in 1977 , the justices extended its precedents to include public - worker unions			1
but such fees can not be used by unions to support purely political activities , such as backing electoral candidates			2
forced to subsidize union lobbying ? under the cooperative federal - state @entity132 for poor and disabled @entity134 , @entity22 decided a decade ago to expand its authority over the estimated 28,000 home - care aides in the state			1
@entity22 lawmakers justified the change by arguing even though the workers are typically employed by the individual patient , they are reimbursed under state - controlled @entity144 funds			1
those home - care assistants are considered state workers only for the purposes of collected bargaining , with @entity38 the exclusive representative for the separate rehabilitation and @entity152 programs administered by @entity22			1
during arguments , @entity153 said his handful of clients -- many of whom provide home health services for their own family members -- were being " forced " to subsidize the union 's efforts before the state , which he said was lobbying and " political in nature			1
" " but how does it differ from the typical bargaining that a union does ? it asks for a wage rate and it asks for various benefits , " said justice @entity168 , skeptically			1
" so are you saying that when it 's in the public sector , it gets converted into something else ? " " what stops the people who oppose the union policy from sending a letter , asking a meeting , expressing their disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they want to whatever policy a union is advocating ? is there anything that stops them from doing that ? " asked justice @entity189			2
when told there was nothing stopping them , she continued , " so where 's the @entity88 abridgement ? " justice @entity199 later added , " so you 're essentially destroying not just the [ agency ] shop , but you 're destroying the ability of the union to get money even from the people who do n't agree with what it 's doing			2
" justice @entity209 put the question in more practical terms			0
" you 're asking us to overturn a case that 's been the law for 35 years ... i guess there are millions of instances in which employees and employers and others have relied on it in collective bargaining , " he said , wondering " why we should upset reasonable expectations over so long a period of time			1
" but some on the court were concerned these home - care workers were being treated differently than others in the public sector			1
when pressed by chief justice @entity231 , the attorney for the union , @entity233 , said home - care workers could be forced to pay for the union 's efforts to raise its @entity144 rates , but not public school teachers , whose union may be doing the same thing			1
@entity233 said since home - aid workers are paid directly through @entity144 , such negotiation and advocacy was " perfectly appropriate			1
" " so the same speech with respect to one union is a speech on a matter of public concern , but with respect to another union , it 's not ? " @entity231 asked , with his hand on his face			2
@entity254 says union representation helps all the state argues state - compelled union representation has increased wages and benefits , reduced turnover and improved training and supervision for home - care workers who typically do not operate in a centralized workplace			1
and officials say allowing patients to be cared at home by those aides instead of permanent institutionalization has saved the state more than $ 630 million in @entity144 costs			0
but those aides bringing suit say the government has not justified its control , since no one in the state directly supervises them			0
and they say unions negotiating with the state naturally involve matters of public concern , which deserve greater protection from compelled free speech and association			2
among the plaintiffs is @entity287 , who cares for her daughter , @entity288 , in their home because of the girl 's quadriplegic cerebral palsy , a stroke and numerous surgeries			0
she says being designated a " state employee " is not proper , since @entity22 merely subsidizes a participants costs of hiring a provider for her daughter , which happens to be herself			1
she attended the arguments and told @entity1 afterward she was hopeful of prevailing			0
near the end of the public session , justice @entity301 raised the elephant - in - the - room issue , the suggestion the state 's interest in having the union represent the home - care workers was about political payback			1
" do you think that the specific factual background of what occurred here provides a basis for skepticism about @entity22 's reason for adopting this ? " the federal government 's lawyer , solicitor general @entity319 , replied the state -- as the " manager " of the @entity144 reimbursement program -- should not have its motives questioned			1
" i thought the situation was that @entity328 [ @entity327 ] @entity326 got a huge campaign contribution from the union and virtually as soon as he got into office [ in 2003 ] he took out his pen and signed an executive order that had the effect of putting , what was it , $ 3.6 million into the union coffers			0
" the current conservative majority on the court has been accused of being overly sympathetic of big business over worker and union rights			0
two years ago , in a related case , the court hinted it may be willing to rethink its views on union fees in the larger context of free speech			0
the question could turn on whether the specific facts in this dispute would be enough to cast aside precedent , and allow a sweeping ruling against the union			2
the case is @entity355 ( 11 - 681 )			0
a decision is due by late june .			0

non-union employees challenge @entity22 negotiations
they contend they should not be considered union - covered state employees
unions argue all workers benefit from collective bargaining
