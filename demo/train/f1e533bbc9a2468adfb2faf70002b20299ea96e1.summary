-- health coverage is easy to get if you 're healthy			1
the problem is when you 're sick or have a history of illness			2
for decades , people with life - threatening chronic diseases such as cancer , diabetes , heart disease or stroke faced numerous barriers to getting the care they needed			1
insurers could deny coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition , terminate coverage when the cost of a patient 's care exceeded arbitrary dollar limits , or raise premiums to unaffordable levels in response to a diagnosis			0
as a result , patients had to skip or cut short their treatment because of costs , or go deeply into debt to pay for needed care			0
the patient protections enacted into law in 2010 are changing that , enabling more @entity37 to afford lifesaving care			1
these protections provide patients with the best chance to beat their illness			0
when fully implemented in 2014 , they will require insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions , eliminate dollar limits on the coverage a patient can receive and ban the practice of inflating premiums for people with health concerns			0
the law makes these protections possible by requiring that most @entity37 buy health insurance			1
by ensuring that coverage extends both to healthy people , who are less expensive to insure , and to those who are sick , who cost more , the law helps to keep costs down for those who need care the most			1
unfortunately , the " individual responsibility " requirement has been attacked as unconstitutional , posing a grave threat to the law 's critical patient protections			2
federal appeals courts are divided on the issue , and the @entity37 @entity67 hears arguments on the matter this week			2
opinion : health reform could survive loss of individual mandate our organizations , which represent tens of millions of people across the country with life - threatening chronic diseases , together submitted a friend - of - the - court brief asserting that the individual responsibility provision is essential to preserving the protections that patients desperately need and deserve			2
we already know what a health care system without such a requirement looks like : many healthy @entity37 opt not to buy health coverage until they are ill , and costs skyrocket as insurance pools fill with people in urgent need of treatment and care			1
people with pre-existing conditions are charged exorbitant rates for health coverage , putting critical care out of reach for many @entity37 families			1
as a result , many people with a chronic illness must resort to emergency room care , which lowers their chances of surviving their illness and drives up costs system - wide			0
opinion : why health care reform law is unconstitutional many of those who want the individual responsibility requirement struck down also express support for the patient protections that the provision makes possible			1
several states have tried such an approach by enacting insurance protections for patients with pre-existing conditions without compelling healthy people to enter the insurance market as well			2
these states are now among the most expensive in the country in which to buy insurance , and two of them , @entity124 and @entity125 , ended up repealing those protections because of increasingly unaffordable premiums			0
half of all non-elderly @entity37 are living with a pre-existing medical condition			0
they need the protection from discrimination by insurers that the @entity135 provides			0
our hope is that the @entity67 will enable all @entity37 to benefit from the promise of access to guaranteed , affordable and adequate insurance			1
it is a promise our nation must keep			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 .			0
