" she was 15 at the time			0

what : @entity144 when : 1794 @entity32 : a popular uprising broke out against a federal excise tax on liquor and the stills that produced it			0
after @entity152 's governor said he did n't have enough militia to enforce compliance , secretary of war @entity150 called for more than 12,000 troops from @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity152			2
