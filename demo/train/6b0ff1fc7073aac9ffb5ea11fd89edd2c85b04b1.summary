-- police gunned down @entity2 , 22 , in a @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , on august 4			1
recently released surveillance video , synced with a recording of the 911 call , reveals the blatant dishonesty and falsehoods that led to his death as he talked on his cellphone in the pet aisle , casually holding a pellet gun that he had picked up from a shelf in the store			1
that a young black man was shot to death by police is nothing new			1
it was simply caught on tape this time			2
in the 911 call , we hear @entity25 repeatedly telling the operator that @entity2 is pointing " a gun " at people			1
at one point , he tells the operator that @entity2 is " loading it right now " and that " he just pointed it at , like , two children			1
" @entity25 told the media that @entity2 " was just waving it [ a gun ] at children and people			1
i could n't hear anything that he was saying			2
i 'm thinking that he is either going to rob the place or he 's there to shoot somebody else			1
" the man looked kind of serious , @entity25 said			1
" he did n't really want to be looked at and when people did look at him , he was pointing the gun at them			1
he was pointing at people			1
" at no point in the surveillance video did @entity2 point the air rifle at anyone			1
he did not " load it			0
" and when police encountered @entity2 , they shot him almost immediately			1
what happened to @entity2 has happened to many black men in the past , killed for their hands ' terrifying proximity to a wallet , or a cellphone or a pocket			1
this , combined with prevailing racist narratives and practices , can quickly transform " black man " into " armed and dangerous killer			1
" @entity25 dialed 911 and his statements did not reflect the truth			1
he 's old enough to know white imagination often trumps black truth			1
@entity25 had plenty of time on his 911 call to tell the story accurately			2
@entity2 , on the other hand , had no time to think , let alone form a complete sentence in his defense			1
deliberately " making false alarms " is a crime under @entity5 law , punishable by a fine or jail sentence			0
but @entity25 has not been charged with anything			0
even with videotaped evidence of police destroying black people , many freedom - loving @entity83 remain unconvinced of a systemic problem			2
maybe some day the perfect tape will be released , one in which the dead or maimed @entity83 has just the right wardrobe , complexion , size and diction to warrant empathy			0
for centuries , certain white civilians and members of law enforcement have used the privileged presumption of decency afforded them to cast aspersions on black people			2
such aspersions are deadly for @entity83			0
@entity2 's fate is one few white people will ever fear or experience , particularly in a brightly lit @entity3			1
in @entity5 , it 's legal to openly carry a gun , yet @entity2 was killed for openly carrying a toy			1
@entity2 was not in the streets			1
he was in one of the nation 's largest toy and gun retailers			1
if we 're in a toy and gun store , and i 'm holding what could be either , is n't it at least plausible i 'm a customer ? if you swing by the barbecue grill section and pick up a grilling fork and lighter fluid , you do n't magically become a knife - wielding arsonist			1
kids grab toy guns from the shelves and act out gun fights in the aisles all the time			2
they are never gunned down by the guys from " @entity134			0
" let 's be practical			2
we 've all seen something that , at first glance , looked a little sketchy			0
maybe a lady leaves her bag on the train			0
you could immediately yell " bomb ! " -- but that would be hasty and irresponsible			0
you could get the woman 's attention , or tell other people , or notify the conductor , or call in a suspicious package			2
what you can not do is call 911 and say she 's strapping on bombs to kill little kids			1
officers are paid to assess situations and act in the interest of the law and public safety			0
being a police officer can be very dangerous			0
incidentally , so can being black in @entity162			2
time and time again , when law enforcement engages @entity83 , they skip the protocol and get right to the violence			0
if police know @entity2 has a " gun " based on @entity25 's call , they also know he 's alone and cornered			1
they know @entity2 can hear , as evidenced by his ongoing phone conversation			1
police are really good at announcing themselves -- unseen and at a safe distance			0
maybe from a few aisles away , they could have said : " drop the weapon , kick it toward my voice and get on the floor ! " instead , they ran up on him unannounced , shouting and shooting like maniacs			0
of course you would be as startled and terrified as @entity2 was in that incomprehensibly brief moment ; suddenly under siege from big , armed , yelling , faceless figures charging and shooting him			1
the tape reveals a young father racked with horror , confusion and pain , as the very people sworn to protect him , snatch his life			2
no indictment in police shooting death of @entity5 man carrying air rifle you ca n't startle the hell out of an unsuspecting @entity162 who 's committed no crime , then shoot him to death for being startled			1
or can you ? once again , our " justice system " reviewed the evidence before it and determined that the shooting was justified			0
historically , the justifications for similarly motivated homicides have essentially been the same : he looked at a white woman			0
he was wearing a hoodie			0
he was a teenager playing his personal music preference at a high volume			0
he was wounded , delirious and terrified after a car accident			0
he was lying face down with his hands cuffed behind his back			0
he fit the " so called " description			0
he was holding his wallet			2
she was seeking help after an accident			0
there is no moral or legal justification for @entity2 's death at 22			1
opinion : how @entity3 can help confront racism now , many of your experiences with police may have been associated with respect , fairness and decency			1
but that should n't influence our ability to interpret the evidence			0
we must acknowledge that for a significant portion of the @entity162 population , fairness and decency at the hands of the law , police or the courts is not the reality			0
@entity83 in particular have witnessed or been victim to disproportionate police violence and abuse -- sometimes to the point of death			0
watching cops harass or unlawfully detain , demean , choke or taunt people is not only real for some people of color , it is routine			2
we 're tired of being told we 're seeing ghosts			0
if you care to look , the data is perfectly visible			2
and we need your help			0
the existence of your neighbor 's pain is not dependent upon your belief in it			2
and we can not improve a situation that we do n't acknowledge			0
learning from patterns is both basic and critical to the progress of human " civilization			0
" we must stop reflexively dismissing our nation 's shortcomings by telling oppressed people what @entity162 does and does not stand for			2
i assure you , they are well aware .			0

@entity287 fatally shot @entity2 , a young black man holding an air rifle , in a @entity3
@entity290 : 911 caller *wrong* when he said @entity2 was pointing and loading " gun "
@entity290 : @entity2 's killing once again shows racist assumptions about black men
@entity290 : data show cops shoot first , ask later when it comes to blacks , an *injustice* to all
