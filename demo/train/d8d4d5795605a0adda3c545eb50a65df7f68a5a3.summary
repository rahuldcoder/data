-- when @entity3 invaded and annexed @entity4 , @entity2 leaders warned @entity3 against trying the same trick in mainland @entity6			1
@entity3 is now trying the same trick in mainland @entity6			1
over the past several days , masked , heavily armed men have seized strategic locations in eastern @entity6			1
in @entity11 , @entity10 armed forces have occupied @entity12			0
in @entity14 , they have taken control of the regional legislature building and the interior ministry			0
in @entity19 , they have taken the compound of the state security agency			0
in the city of @entity24 , in the @entity14 region , armed men shot their way into police headquarters			0
cell phone towers are being toppled through the area , according to @entity6 's acting interior minister , apparently with a view to silencing nonmilitary communications			1
uniformed men have established checkpoints around the city of @entity35 , also near @entity14			0
a gunfight erupted at one checkpoint on sunday , apparently leaving two dead			0
the @entity3 have infiltrated special forces into @entity6 over the past weeks and months			1
now they are busily creating conditions of " instability " that could provide a pretext for outright @entity3 intervention , followed most likely by a partition of @entity6 and alignment of the eastern provinces toward @entity3			1
in @entity4 , @entity3 intervention has been followed by a campaign of " disappearances " of opposition and potential opposition figures			1
inside @entity3 too , policy is turning again sharply repressive , symbolized by the spread of hammer - and - sickle flags at @entity57 demonstrations			2
@entity58 outside the @entity59 has known profound peace since 1991			2
even the murderous wars in the former @entity62 , atrocious as they were , never threatened the general @entity58 peace			0
the @entity3 ' actions in @entity6 do threaten the general peace			1
@entity3 is using military force -- as opposed to its usual tool kit of corruption , intimidation , and no - return - address assassination -- to reclaim former @entity72 - occupied territory			2
in @entity6 , @entity3 has launched a war of reconquest			1
it 's very hard to predict where that war will stop			0
president @entity76 was very wrong in his speech in @entity78 on march 26 to suggest that the @entity79 had no national interest in @entity6			0
what 's at stake in @entity6 is the peace and stability of the @entity58 continent , an issue over which the @entity79 fought two world wars			1
yet the president has signaled to @entity3 that it need not fear any very robust @entity79 or @entity90 response to its depredations in @entity6			1
opinion : the @entity93 must not blame itself for @entity96 's revanchism more from the march 26 speech : " of course , @entity6 is not a member of @entity90 -- in part because of its close and complex history with @entity3			1
nor will @entity3 be dislodged from @entity4 or deterred from further escalation by military force			2
" when a president announces that he does not think a foreign aggressor 's actions can be deterred , what message does that foreign aggressor hear ? " @entity108 ! " unsurprisingly , @entity3 is driving right through that green light			2
the @entity79 response ? over the weekend , the @entity111 announced that vice president @entity112 will visit @entity6 on april 22 , or not for another 10 days			0
ten days from now , @entity96 could be standing under a " @entity114 " banner in @entity11			0
every supposed benefit we receive from @entity76 's famed @entity3 " reset " is disintegrating before our eyes			2
news is arriving of another @entity120 chemical attack , in the village of @entity122 , 125 miles northeast of @entity123			0
@entity120 still holds most of the chemical warfare arsenal that was supposed to have been entirely surrendered to @entity3 by february 5			0
@entity3 has announced plans to bust up the international sanctions regime against @entity127 with purchases of 500,000 barrels of @entity127 oil a day , potentially nearly doubling @entity127 's oil exports			1
this is a rampage of mischief , far beyond one remote region of southeast @entity58			0
and yet even as the threat to peace intensifies , the @entity2 leaders and @entity2 alliances charged with keeping the peace dither , fidget , and hem and haw			0
the most urgent necessity now : deploy teams of @entity90 observers to the cities that are targets of @entity3 activity in eastern @entity6			1
@entity90 needs eyes and ears on the ground -- and @entity3 must confront that it is fomenting an international crisis			1
@entity90 needs rapidly to expand its permanent presence with the exposed eastern members of the alliance , especially the three @entity156 republics			2
such a move would violate the terms of the 1997 agreement with @entity3 on @entity90 expansion , which is precisely why it 's an apt response to @entity3 's violation of the 1994 agreement on @entity6 's territorial integrity			1
@entity6 needs help improving its military and police capacities			2
@entity3 is infiltrating forces across the border with pathetic ease			2
this is partly because @entity6 's wretchedly underpaid officials are easily bribed and partly because @entity6 's forces are too small , ill - equipped and untrained to do much even when not bribed			1
the next round of sanctions on @entity3 should focus on banks and financial institutions that move the ill - gotten wealth of @entity3 's corrupt leadership to safe havens in the @entity93			1
@entity96 's fortune is not stored in rubles			0
he 's all too aware that someday , the kind of rebellion that toppled his @entity6 stooges might topple him			2
it wo n't be easy to find that money , although of course @entity90 authorities should start the search			1
what is easier is to target institutions , @entity3 and @entity2 , that move money out of @entity3 -- or that have suspicious clients from @entity3			0
in the longer term , @entity58 needs to shift its natural gas sourcing away from @entity3			1
the @entity79 will have to allow natural gas exports , and both @entity199 and the @entity79 will need to induce private actors to build the liquid natural gas facilities that make exports feasible			0
it 's a big job			0
but we face a big threat .			0

gunmen seize *key* parts of eastern @entity6 ; *pro-russian* forces create instability
@entity212 : remark that military intervention wo n't work *implies* @entity93 will look away
@entity216 : @entity3 threatens stability of @entity58 ; @entity90 observers need to *monitor* events
he says sanctions must hurt @entity3 *investments* ; @entity6 's weak military needs help
