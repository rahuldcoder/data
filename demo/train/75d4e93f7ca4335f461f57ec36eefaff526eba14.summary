it is not clear that he made a similar promise regarding @entity19 media			1
@entity34 criticized censorship in his november visit to @entity19 , responding to questions from the @entity19 public about restrictions on the @entity112			1
" because in the @entity170 information is free , and i have a lot of critics in the @entity170 who can say all kinds of things about me , i actually think that that makes our democracy stronger and it makes me a better leader because it forces me to hear opinions that i do n't want to hear , " he said			0
