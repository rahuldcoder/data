-- the first time i viewed an @entity4 recruitment video , i squinted at a scratchy black blob shimmying across the screen			2
it took a moment to recognize this was an amateur effort to obliterate the image of a woman from a clip of a politician 's visit to @entity15			2
the blob was evidently his wife			0
i wondered at the time it must have taken to erase her from every frame			0
of all the rapid - fire images of death and destruction in the video , i found this one the most chilling			0
that same feeling surfaced in the days after @entity26 killed @entity27 two years ago			1
i watched talking heads on every network hold forth on the takedown			0
almost without exception , they were men			0
i felt like my female colleagues had been erased from the picture			1
in the 1990s it was largely women who tracked the threat from @entity27 , who pieced together slivers of data to form a surprisingly accurate picture of an international terror network that had yet to announce its existence to the world			1
when @entity45 interviewed me for the documentary " @entity46 , " he asked what it was that made women so good at tracking terrorists			1
i felt a moment of panic at being led into the minefield of gender stereotypes			0
i worried about discounting the efforts of some excellent male counterterrorism analysts i had known			1
then i thought to myself , " yes , women do have a special genius for the job			1
" to step firmly into the stereotype minefield , is it because terrorism is all about relationships ? perhaps			1
using the @entity66 bombing as an example , let 's look at the mother and how she may have influenced the older son who in turn could have influenced the younger one			0
at this moment analysts are following that circle of relationships outward , looking at other friends and family members			1
analysts are trying to suppress their own egos and put themselves into the minds of the suspected terrorists			1
what do i need to carry out this attack and to whom do i turn for help ? suppressing one 's ego is an important part of being a good counterterrorism analyst			1
first , you have to be willing to admit up front what you do n't know			0
the amount of data is so large that no one individual can look at all of it			0
a good analyst acknowledges her blind spots and networks with other analysts to fill them			1
@entity98 : @entity27 dead , @entity99 lives when it comes to ego suppression , women are just better at it than men			1
they 've had more practice			0
i ran across one man who never admitted to any gaps in knowledge			0
whenever someone would try to tell him something , he would blithely say , " i knew that			0
" he did n't last long as a counterterrorism analyst			1
another characteristic of the women who tracked @entity27 is that they did n't have their egos so caught up in their " careers " that they let it affect their jobs			1
for an analyst , the path to career advancement lies through a " hot account , " which means a subject that attracts policymaker interest			0
@entity4 was not a hot account in the 1990s			0
some managers resented the amount of time the women spent on it			1
on career appraisals , one report written for the policymaker often counted for more than months spent sifting through data and working with counterparts on the clandestine side of the house			0
their careers suffered because the women were so focused on the job of tracking @entity4			2
these women had the intellectual discipline and honesty to allow their conclusions to arise from the data , rather than taking the shortcut of cherry - picking the data to fit preconceived notions			2
for whatever reason , women are particularly good at perceiving patterns in a nonstop stream of seemingly random data			2
terrorism analysis requires persistence , tenacity , patience and dedication			0
the women who tracked @entity27 had those characteristics in spades			1
in the days after 911 , one analyst was working 18 - hour days despite severe back pain			2
when she finally took the time to go to a doctor , she found out she had a broken vertebra			0
then she went back to the office and continued to work the long hours			0
these women broke down in tears , struggled with guilt , depression and the physical impact of stress			2
they juggled the job with the demands of motherhood , eldercare and other personal issues that do n't disappear after a terrorist attack			0
through it all they continued to do their jobs , because , by @entity182 , they were n't going to let that bastard @entity27 win			1
i have one urgent request for the @entity186 , @entity187 and other relevant agencies			2
after the next attack , could you please send a woman to talk to the press ? you have lots of them and , trust me , they know what they 're talking about			0
please do it to improve the morale of your female officers and give their daughters a better understanding of their options in life			1
the women are tired of being invisible			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

@entity207 : too often role of women in counterterrorism is *de-emphasized*
she says women were *instrumental* in early days of search for @entity27
the analysts proved better at understanding relationships and at suppressing ego , she says
@entity207 : agencies should put female analysts in spotlight when attacks happen
