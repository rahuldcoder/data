needing to win to stay in the tournament , @entity1 failed to capitalize on a quick start to their innings , losing a clutch of wickets in the middle period to post a modest total of 243			1
the @entity4 got off to a fast start themselves and looked well set to clinch their place in the last eight at 222 - 6 before losing their last four wickets for three runs to hand @entity1 an astonishing triumph			1
@entity1 will be through to the quarterfinals if @entity19 leaders @entity20 beat @entity21 on saturday or @entity22 beat the @entity4 on sunday			1

but @entity1 slumped from 121 - 3 to 151 - 6 as @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 all went in quick succession			2
they were grateful to @entity37 , who hit 44 , and an unbeaten 20 from @entity38 to set a competitive target			0

six runs were given instead			0
with the partnership between @entity58 and @entity59 reaching 72 , @entity4 needed just 24 more runs to win before the game turned on its head			1
@entity71 was trapped lbw by @entity47 before fellow spinner @entity72 then dismissed @entity58 and @entity73 in consecutive balls			2
