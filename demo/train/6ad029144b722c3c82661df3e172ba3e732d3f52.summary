-- so what did we learn at sunday night 's @entity3 ? first off , we learned that sketch comedians are so much better at giving acceptance speeches than rock stars , screenwriters and actors who 've won @entity9 and @entity10 for dramatic roles			1
" who knew ? " as @entity13 put it when he delivered one of the evening 's most compact acceptances , for best lead actor in a tv comedy or musical in @entity21 's " @entity20 " ( a surprise winner for best comedy series , by the way			0
) we also learned that actresses say the darnedest things on tv when they 're drinking a lot			2
( what was that @entity30 said about @entity31 and barbiturates when she got the @entity3 for best actress in a drama in " @entity35 " ? ) one trusts that the @entity37 , which sponsors the awards , has also learned that when you nominate somebody four times for a @entity3 over four decades without giving her one , you 'd better be prepared for retributive pain when you finally come through			1
though i have to admit that as the ceremonies trudged along , part of me was hoping @entity47 , who finally won a @entity3 for best supporting actress in a tv movie , miniseries or series as a lonely dowager in " @entity53 , " would get called back for more ragged stream - of - consciousness and disregard for decorum			1
the authenticity of her speech , which included a bleeped expletive , somehow burst through the ceremony 's glitz -- and , at 69 , she still made for a gorgeous - looking train wreck			0
but did we learn for sure who 's going to win the @entity9 on march 2 ? not really			2
5 things we learned from the 2014 @entity3 it 's true that @entity30 came away as big a favorite in her category as she was before the pipes burst earlier that night , flooding the red carpet			1
but nothing short of a tsunami will stop her appointment with the best actress @entity9 for her rendering of a shattered socialite			1
the rest are not so clear			0
" @entity82 " won the best drama @entity3 , matching most advance expectations			0
but it did n't win as many globes as the best comedy or musical winner , " @entity87			0
" both @entity89 ' win for best actress in a comedy or musical ( which was mildly unexpected ) and @entity93 's win for best supporting actress ( which was n't ) seemed to boost " @entity97 's " profile in the @entity9 race			2
but both " @entity97 's " director , @entity100 , and " @entity102 's " director , @entity101 , lost the best director race to @entity104 for his orchestration of the harrowing " gravity			0
" let 's face facts : though some insist on seeing the globes as an @entity9 tip sheet , you ca n't easily align awards that split their categories between comedy and drama with those that do n't			1
there have been some years where a @entity3 drama winner gets the best picture @entity9 ( 2001 's " @entity122 " ) and the comedy - musical winner does n't ( " @entity125 ! " )			1
then there are those years when the opposite is true			0
( 1998 , when " @entity130 " won best picture while " @entity129 " did n't )			0
and then , too , there are those years when neither of the @entity3 winners is in the best picture winner at the @entity9 ( 1992 , when " @entity135 " bested both " @entity136 " and " @entity137 , " and 1993 , when both " @entity138 " and " @entity139 " lost to " @entity140 , " and 1991 , when ... and we could go on and on ... )			1
so as usual , we 're left at the end of another @entity3 show wondering , what exactly was the point ? that is , besides the comedy factor , both intended ( hosts @entity148 and @entity149 , who did n't have nearly as much to do this year as last ) and unintended			1
@entity3 : best moments and @entity151 maybe it 's best to look at the @entity3 less as tea leaves or portents for future awards and more as shiny paper for the global village to unwrap every january as the true beginning of @entity160 's ritual of self - congratulation			2
the various film critics awards are ( for the most part , anyway ) more measured and thoughtful signals as to what will be taken seriously between holiday openings and @entity9 night			2
but the @entity3 are when the moms , mall rats and reality - show audiences begin noticing what the more serious and solemn movies are doing with themselves as their makers and actors campaign for support from the @entity9 voters			1
you can downgrade their importance or dismiss their results as much as you like			0
but the @entity3 are , like it or not , an @entity179 , much like weddings , @entity181 and other rituals that often provoke sentiment and warmth -- and slavishness and inappropriate behavior			0
so wait for the trade awards to get their results out and hope that whomever 's in charge of these awards does n't take anything @entity47 says too seriously			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity194 : what did @entity3 show ? actress *+* drinking *=* *interesting* speech
he says @entity30 , @entity47 livened things up with frank remarks ; hosts had less to do
he says even with two best picture awards , globes are *flawed* **predictor** of @entity9 winners
@entity211 : globes mostly *flashy* kickoff of awards *season* ; critic awards better **predictor**
