-- before saturday , a @entity2 teenager who sent or received nude photos or video could have been charged with a felony and forced to register as a sex offender			1
but a new law , recognizing the proliferation of cell phones and computers , eases the penalties for " sexting " infractions			1
a first offense is punishable by eight hours of community service or a $ 60 fine ; the second is a misdemeanor and the third is a felony			1
state rep. @entity20 , @entity21 , sponsored the legislation , which was approved in june			0
" when our child pornography laws were written , they failed to take into account advances in technology , such as cell phones , " @entity20 said in a statement published on the website of @entity0 affiliate @entity25 in @entity26			0
" ( this bill ) modernizes these laws to ensure that children 's lives are not ruined due to youthful indiscretion			0
this reform will let our youth know that such behavior is wrong without labeling them sex offenders for the rest of their lives			2
" @entity0 could not immediately reach @entity20 for comment saturday			0
under @entity48 , teens who receive explicit images wo n't be charged if they took reasonable steps to report it , did not solicit the image and did not send it to someone			1
a recent @entity56 / @entity55 poll of @entity58 behavior found one of three teen and young adult respondents said they 've taken part in " sexting , " which includes sending sexually charged texts			1

" there 's probably a lot of kids who do n't realize how this ( sexting ) could impact their life , " @entity83 of @entity84 told @entity0 affiliate @entity85 .			2
