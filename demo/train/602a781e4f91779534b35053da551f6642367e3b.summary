@entity0 -- when i first heard that a nine - year - old boy had been found tied to a bus stop in @entity0 , i was surprised			1
he ca n't have been , i thought			0
in @entity0 ? when i found out where the bus stop in question was , i was even more surprised			1
i pass by that area often			0
i 'd never seen a young boy chained to a pole			2
had i passed by and just not noticed ? like me , thousands of @entity12 did n't see @entity13 , who suffers from cerebral palsy , on the pavement			1
according to the last census conducted in 2011 , around 26.8 million people are in living with disabilities in @entity19			2
that 's 2.2 % of the population of more than 1.2 billion			2
other bodies , including the @entity23 , say the figure is much higher			0
however , many of disabled people , like @entity13 , are allowed to quietly fade into the background in a populous country wracked by poverty where the worth and survival of many depends on their ability to work			1
let me tell you @entity13 's story			1
life on the pavement in addition to cerebral palsy , the general term for a group of neurological conditions that affect the body 's movement and coordination , @entity13 is deaf and mute			1
" he was fine when he was born , in fact he was a chubby baby , " his paternal grandmother @entity46 recalls			2
she says a few months later , @entity13 developed a high fever			1
" one night , he shook violently , " she says			0
" he was never the same again			0
" @entity51 tears up when she talks to us about her grandson			0
we meet her at her home -- a grimy stretch of pavement , right behind the bus stop			2
desperately poor , this is where she lives			2
she sleeps here on a sari she spreads onto the ground			0
she eats here , buying food from a street vendor when she can afford to			0
she is @entity13 's only caretaker			1
she tells us his father passed away four years ago			0
his older sister ran away			0
for a long time , it was just @entity46 and her grandson living , eating , sleeping and surviving together on the pavement			0
she may be in her 70s , but @entity46 still works to earn a meager living selling small toys and trinkets on @entity77 , a popular beachfront in the heart of @entity0			1
she says she had no choice but to tie him to a pole			2
" he is deaf so he would not be able to hear traffic coming			2
if he ran onto the road , he 'd get killed , " she says			0
" see , it 's a long rope , " @entity46 says , as she shows me the frayed cloth she would use to tie @entity13 's leg			1
i notice many of them , tied to different poles			0
@entity13 is not alone there are many children like @entity13 in @entity0 , says @entity94 , a social worker			1
mutha 's been involved with his case since the end of may			0
@entity13 was taken into care after a photographer published his photo in the local newspaper			1
a police constable saw it and asked @entity95 to intervene			0
" when i saw him first , i did feel he needs help			0
he needs a home , " @entity95 recalls			0
since his grandmother is already 70 years old , he could be without a caretaker in five or 10 years , she says			0
he needed somewhere secure to stay			0
unable to find a shelter that looks after children with special needs , @entity95 took him to a government - run juvenile center in @entity0			1
@entity13 is there now but @entity95 is n't happy because it 's not a home for children with special needs			1
and that 's the problem , @entity95 says			0
there 's a serious shortage of residential facilities for children with disabilities in @entity0			1
the superintendent of the facility , @entity125 says @entity13 is being well looked after but he too is trying to find him a more suitable home			1
according to @entity125 , there is only one shelter for children with special needs in @entity0 and he ca n't get @entity13 a spot there because that too is severely overcrowded			1
@entity1 attempted several times to contact the minister responsible for women and children 's affairs in @entity0 , @entity139 , but received no response			1
her office is a short walk away from bus stop 59 where @entity13 was found			1
poverty and disability are dangerous combinations , says dr. @entity148 , who works with able disable people together ( @entity150 ) , a nonprofit organization whose mission is to create an inclusive disability - friendly @entity19			0
those who can afford to give their children or family members the care they need , do so			1
those who ca n't , end up like @entity13 ; on the streets , with no recourse to social services , invisible to the public			2
