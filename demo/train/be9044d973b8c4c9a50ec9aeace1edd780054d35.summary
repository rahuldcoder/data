-- @entity2 football has been plagued by racism scandals in the past year , and now its ruling body must deal with what is thought to be the first case of racial abuse by a @entity9 referee			1
league leaders @entity10 made a complaint over " inappropriate language " used by ref @entity13 during sunday 's controversial 3 - 2 home defeat by @entity15			1
@entity10 's complaint focused on comments made to two of its players in two separate incidents			1
@entity13 had already infuriated the @entity23 champions by sending off two of their players , dismissing @entity27 for diving even though he had been fouled and then allowing @entity15 's winning goal to stand even though television replays showed it appeared to be offside			2
with the issue of racism in @entity2 football under intense scrutiny , and following in the wake of @entity10 's own problems with captain @entity40 's ban for racially abusing an opponent , the allegations against @entity32 come at a time when the @entity43 is under pressure to be seen to be taking a strong stance			1
" i ca n't think of any previous such incident in the professional game off the top of my head , " an @entity43 spokesman told @entity0			2
" in grassroots football , yes , i can recall incidents but in the professional game i would have to check the record books			0
" the @entity43 said on monday they had launched an investigation into the allegations , while @entity13 has welcomed " the opportunity for the facts to be established			1
" " we have lodged a complaint to the @entity9 match delegate with regard to inappropriate language used by the referee and directed at two of our players in two separate incidents during ( the ) match , " @entity10 said in a statement said on sunday			1
" the match delegate will pass the complaint to the @entity43			2
we will make no further comment at this time			0
" @entity72 media have reported that one of the players involved was @entity10 's @entity76 international @entity75			1
for the past year , the @entity77 have been at the heart of a racism row after an incident involving @entity40 and @entity82 defender @entity81 during a @entity9 match in october 2011			0
the @entity43 found @entity40 guilty of racially abusing @entity81 , even though a court had earlier cleared the former @entity87 captain			0
the @entity43 -- which requires a lower burden of proof than an @entity2 criminal court -- barred the 31 - year - old for four games for the incident and also fined him £ 220,000			0
@entity40 missed sunday 's @entity96 clash with second - placed @entity15 , who now trail @entity10 by just a point , as he served the second game of his ban			2
@entity10 's complaint means the @entity43 will now have questions to answer after an allegation against one of its top referees			1
the body which represents @entity9 referees -- the @entity108 ( @entity109 ) -- said it is aware of the allegations and " they are being treated with the utmost seriousness			0
" " @entity13 will co-operate fully and welcomes the opportunity for the facts to be established , " it said in a statement			1
all four match officials -- the referee , his two assistants and the fourth official -- wore microphones and ear pieces that allowed them to hear what each other was saying throughout the match			0
but under the guidelines of football 's world governing body @entity129 , what is said between them is not recorded			0
the allegations against @entity32 come at a time when the @entity43 is already under fire from several black players , who feel that the punishment meted out to @entity40 for his racist abuse was too lenient			2
@entity140 's @entity139 have also launched an investigation after a steward was injured in the aftermath of @entity15 's winning goal			0
scorer @entity145 appeared to be pelted by objects from the crowd while footage emerged of a steward falling over advertising hoardings and onto the pitch			0
earlier this month , a number of black players refused to wear t - shirts promoting an anti-racism campaign in protest at a perceived lack of action about the problem from the game 's leading bodies			0
the @entity32 case came on the same afternoon as referee @entity163 earned the wrath of @entity166 manager @entity165 , who felt that @entity169 striker @entity168 should have been sent off for a bad tackle in sunday 's @entity171 derby against @entity172 , which ended 2 - 2 at @entity173			1
@entity168 himself was at the center of a racism row earlier this year , receiving an eight - match ban after being found guilty by the fa of racially abusing @entity15 defender @entity178			0
four years ago , @entity178 , who played against @entity10 on sunday , was banned for four matches and fined £ 15,000 after clashing with a groundsman at @entity96 , with the @entity43 saying that charges that @entity182 used racially abusive language towards the @entity185 international could not be proven .			1

@entity10 lodge complaint with @entity43 over referee 's " inappropriate language "
@entity13 reportedly used racial language towards @entity75
@entity43 launch investigation after reading match report from @entity32 on monday
@entity32 welcomes opportunity to establish facts in case with few *precedents*
