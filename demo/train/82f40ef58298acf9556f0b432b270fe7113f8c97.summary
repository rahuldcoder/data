@entity4 was governor of the @entity0 capital , @entity31 , for nearly five decades during a period of significant change			1
" when he became governor in 1963 , @entity31 had 200,000 inhabitants â€” today it has more than seven million , " @entity34 , a senior fellow at the @entity36 's @entity35 , said in a commentary			2
" @entity4 presided over this remarkable transformation with a record for good governance and a lack of corruption			2
" " he had to be a combination ... of a reformer , of a judge , a jury in some cases , and deal with dissent , as well as dealing with economic issues , " @entity45 , a former @entity23 ambassador to @entity0 , told @entity3			1
" so i think he 's well prepared for the task at hand			2
" @entity4 's experience running @entity31 also involved keeping many of the numerous members of the @entity0 royal family in line			1
" since most of the royal princes and princesses live in @entity31 , he was also the family sheriff , ensuring any transgressions were dealt with smoothly and quietly , with no publicity , " said @entity60 , who worked for the @entity61 for 30 years			0
his national roles have since brought him wider responsibility			0

" " the two previous @entity0 kingdoms in the 18th and 19th centuries were wracked by internal family squabbles , which their foreign enemies exploited , " he explains			2
" with the @entity79 world facing its worst crisis in decades , the royals will want to present an image of stability and strength			0
" @entity4 's first order after assuming the throne was to appoint his youngest brother , prince @entity100 , as the new crown prince			1
