-- while all eyes were on @entity4 for the election of a new pope , for @entity7 , the importance of the event went beyond an impressive spectacle			1
@entity9 , previously known as cardinal @entity9 from @entity10 , will now be the spiritual and moral leader for more than 1.2 billion @entity7 across the world			1
already , he has given a clear sense of how his tenure will be more distinct from his retired predecessor , asking first for the audience 's prayers instead of giving a blessing , and choosing his name in honor of @entity21 , who humbly dedicated his life to aiding the less fortunate			0
5 things to know about the new pope now some @entity7 are taking a more introspective look at their church and pondering what the pope should focus on			1
from returning to a simpler message to welcoming women -- and gay - friendly views , here are some of the top priorities from @entity7 around the world : rethink the church 's -- and his -- position on gay rights the issue of gay rights has proved deeply controversial within the @entity7 , and led to accusations from activists that it remains mired in the past rather than looking toward a more inclusive future			1
@entity43 from @entity44 thinks the new pope and the church need to rethink their position on gay rights and gay marriage			1
@entity7 : tell us your views on the new pope pope @entity9 once called the @entity10 government support for a bill on gay marriage " an attempt to destroy @entity59 's plan , " but @entity43 says the new pope bears the responsibility of opening the eyes of the church to other views , even if he is conservative			1
" there are gays who are @entity7			1
i 'm not saying [ for him ] to accept that , but not to compare it with evil , " he said			0
" i think he could say that he respects different people and that the house of @entity59 is the house of all			0
" bring much needed reform the @entity75 has been at the forefront of some of the worst scandals wracking the church in recent years , over the sexual abuse of children by men of the cloth			2
@entity85 ireporter and committed @entity86 wants action			0
" [ the church must ] clean up , resolve and prevent future scandals , " said the @entity89 resident			2
" the world has heard enough on this subject and wants to move on			0
" @entity94 was also one of the first people to point out the importance of the name @entity9 , arguing the move was " very telling " because of the medieval @entity101 saint 's emphasis on rebuilding the church , love of the poor , and adeptness at reconciliation			0
" a charismatic or people 's pope might just be just what the people need to be inspired in their faith and bring joy into their [ lives ] , " she argued			0
open up the church to women meanwhile , 50 % of the world 's @entity7 remain excluded from the highest echelons of the church because of their sex -- and @entity121 @entity120 says it 's time the church acknowledged the importance of women in its history , and its future			1
legend of female pope endures " we 're living in a world that has become a global village , [ and ] in this global village of ours , women now ca n't just be fence - sitters or nannies , " he said			1
" women now know that they were created as co-equal of men			0
" he also observes that , to solve the issue of dwindling priest numbers in some parts of the world , the church could make the issue of celibacy for priests optional			1
he also emphasized that the church could no longer stick to the status quo			0
" the @entity7 should become dynamic in this age , so that it can maintain the loyalty of its flocks and win many souls for @entity59 , " he said			2
stop powerful nations from bullying the smaller ones pope @entity9 's election was unique in many ways , not least because of his background -- he 's the first @entity85 pope to lead the church in its history			1
the cardinals ' decision to pick a man from a diverse and rapidly rising continent sparked hope amongst many @entity7 of a new mindset amongst the powers that be in the @entity167 , one that takes emerging powers more seriously			2
in @entity169 , catholic bishop @entity170 , who ministers to @entity172 in the northwest of the country , was " delighted " to hear that a @entity85 pope had been elected by the cardinals in @entity4 , because he was not from @entity178 powers who had dominated the papacy for so long			0
what @entity181 want from the next pope " i pray that a pope from out of @entity184 will help to tame and reverse all the tendencies of the super powers towards weaker nations , [ such as ] arrogance , greed and caprice , " he said			0
and @entity191 , originally from @entity192 but currently in @entity193 , @entity194 , explains that the @entity85 way of doing things in a more accommodating manner , rather than the @entity178 - driven methods of leadership , would prove positive for the church , and its followers			1
" a person from @entity85 thinks in a collective manner rather than individually because society is structured like that , " he reflects			0
" a @entity85 pope brings a message of hope for today 's society			2
" keep it simple ! @entity191 had another piece of advice for the church -- open up and become more approachable , and you may attract a new wave of followers			2
and if they 're looking for inspiration -- pope @entity9 's own austere style of living and worship already set a perfect example			0

and for @entity249 in @entity101 , her message for the new pope was even more succinct : keep it simple			1
" i think that the church needs to go back to a simple message which is to love each other and not care about what religion we are or what we believe in , " she said			1
" i hope he can do this			0
