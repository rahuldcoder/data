@entity0 -- all through the night , limbs fell and transformers blew			1
each sent a sharp crack that echoed across the neighborhood			0
when dawn broke , we could see the culprit -- and the damage : pines in the park across the street stood naked like telephone poles , stripped of their branches under the weight of ice			1
elsewhere , whole trees were felled			1
and across the city , the power was out , overhead lines brought down by ice , trees and boughs			1
the city in a forest was in the dark			1
i was 12 when that happened -- in 1973 -- and i spent much of wednesday waiting for another " storm of the century " to hit @entity0			1
@entity32 , sleet and ice pummeled the @entity35 , and hundreds of thousands lost power			1
but it was nothing like the ice storm that walloped the city 41 years ago and plunged the @entity42 into seven days of survival			1
this time , fortunately , most of the area dodged the bullet			1
that 's not to say the storm did n't take a toll			1
at least two people 's deaths were attributed to the weather , and others experienced close calls			0
but it could have been so much worse			0
this is the storm that forecasters feared : trees laden with ice bringing a city of 6 million to its knees for a week			1
i remember it like it was yesterday : see 1973 footage of the storm from @entity68 on @entity69 we lost power almost immediately -- and with it the heat			1
we had a gas furnace in the basement , but without its electric blower it was useless			1
once the shock of what had happened wore off , and before my sister and i were allowed outside to explore the icy wonderland , my parents acted fast			0
@entity84 turned on the gas stove in the kitchen while @entity87 made space in the adjoining den for us to sleep			1
we were one of the lucky families ; my folks had n't gotten around to remodeling the kitchen in our prewar home with one of those newfangled electric ovens			1
we still had a source of heat			2
@entity87 dragged mattresses from our bedrooms and laid them out next to the pull - out sofa			0
he and @entity84 gathered piles of clothes and blankets , while my sister and i rounded up our favorite toys and books from our rooms			2
and then the doors to the rest of the house were closed			0
for the next six days , this would be our home : the kitchen , breakfast room and den - turned - bedroom heated by a life - saving gas oven			2
candles in @entity116 bottles illuminated the darkness			0
trips to the bathroom on the other side of the house were fast -- and freezing			0
to me , a space geek who followed all the @entity126 and @entity127 missions on live tv , our three - room hovel was a survival capsule where four @entity132 astronauts huddled for warmth , much like the three @entity127 spacemen who had turned their crippled craft into a makeshift life raft that brought them home alive			2
of course our situation was n't nearly as dire as that scenario , made famous later by @entity139 and @entity140			0
but the imagination of a 12 - year - old works wonders in fighting the boredom of being cooped up with your parents and younger sister for a week			2
after a few days , our phone service was restored -- it had gone out with the power ; this was decades before wireless technology and cell phones -- and my mother began calling her friends and cousins			2
one of my favorite cousins lived a few miles away , and the electricity was on at his family 's house			0
they invited us to stay with them immediately			0
my parents held out hope that our power would be back soon , but after two more days of roughing it and no sign of @entity166 on our street , they finally relented			2
we packed up the car and headed over to @entity170 's place			0
his neighborhood was a mess -- trees down everywhere -- and on saturday morning the men came out of their homes carrying chainsaws and gas cans			1
we watched in fascination as they ripped through the limbs , snow still on the ground , and turned debris into firewood			0
after helping haul wood , we were treated with mugs of hot chocolate			0
and by sunday night -- a week after the storm started -- we learned that our power , too , was back			1
turns out we were one of the last streets the linemen reached			0
they must have been exhausted			0
now school loomed -- after a cold but glorious break -- and @entity87 would be returning to work			0
we went home and dismantled our lifeboat , and for the first time in a week spent the night in our own beds			2
what local reporters were calling the " storm of the century " was over			2
for longtime @entity201 , it was a storm we would never forget -- one that would make future storms a bit more bearable .			0

41 years ago , major ice storm felled trees , power lines across @entity0
metro area of *1.5* million lost power for up to a week
families huddled in homes , blocked off rooms , used gas stoves for heat
this is the storm forecasters feared for the city this week
