-- three months after a thyroidectomy to remove cancer and one month after radioactive iodine to treat it , @entity1 found herself in an operating room again , this time for a lumpectomy to remove breast cancer			1
@entity1 's prognosis was good , although doctors said she would need radiation			1
she 's not alone : fifteen percent to 20 % of people diagnosed with cancer are diagnosed with a second cancer , according to dr. @entity14 , chief medical officer for the @entity15			1
however , he says , it 's unusual for those diagnoses to happen simultaneously			1
@entity1 's diagnoses came after she sought a second look			1
she heeded the recommendation to follow up for a spot on her thyroid even though she was told it was probably nothing , and then she was insistent after being given an all - clear following a mammogram			1
in both cases , @entity1 , 51 , of @entity26 , followed her instincts , and she was right			1
one patient advocate applauds that			0
" she moved the bar in her own favor by being proactive and trusting her intuition , " said @entity31 , who was not involved in @entity1 's case			1
" i have a high - demand job , " said @entity1 , director of @entity37 for @entity38			1
" this is like a second job , and no one else is going to do the research			0
" her thyroid spot was seen during an annual physical			2
even though doctors told her it probably was n't cause for concern , @entity1 followed up with an endocrinologist four months later and underwent a biopsy			1
a week later , she got a call saying that it was probably cancer and that doctors would know for sure after surgery to remove it			2
her philosophy : tackle cancer and move on , she says			2
" it was the easiest surgery ever			0
the next day , i was on a plane going somewhere for work with a bandage and wearing scarves , " she said			0
eight weeks later , she had radiation iodine treatment : she took a radioactive pill and stayed isolated in her house for a week and then limited outings for another week			0
two weeks before she took the pill , she felt something unusual during a breast self - exam and asked about it during her scheduled mammogram a week or so later			1
she got an all - clear but did n't trust it and went in for an ultrasound			1
the radiologist sent her for a biopsy , which confirmed that she had breast cancer			1
once again , she geared up to tackle the disease			0
" it 's another specialty , and you start over from scratch , " she said			2
after her lumpectomy , @entity1 had 25 days of radiation			1
now , she takes medication for both cancers			0
@entity1 offeres this advice about taking charge of your care : ask your medical network when looking for a surgeon to remove her thyroid , @entity1 asked everyone from her dentist and orthodontist to her gynecologist			1
" it does n't matter what their specialty is			0
they all know each other , and i 've learned you have to ask multiple doctors , " she said			0
instead of asking them " who should i go to ? " @entity1 asked , " if you were in this situation , who would you go to ? " she got a list of about nine names when looking for a surgeon for her thyroid and chose the doctor whose name was recommended four times			1
she followed this same procedure before her breast biopsy			2
@entity14 recommends casting a wider net , including anyone in the health care field			1
" the nurses who work in the @entity121 at hospitals , they know who the best surgeons are			0
these are not necessarily those who rank in the lists of best doctors , " he said			0
give a deadline the first time @entity1 visited her oncologist , she explained that she and her husband were leaving on an @entity133 safari , their " trip of a lifetime , " the first week in august			1
@entity1 wanted to mark her 50th birthday by going somewhere new			1
she told her oncologist she had to be better by then			0
her last radiation treatment was 10 days before her flight to @entity133 , which gave her time to recover before takeoff			0
doctors may not have a deadline , she says			0
" if i have something else happening , i am going to find a reason to give them a deadline , because things happen much quicker			0
" do n't rely 100 % on mammograms even if they must pay for it out of their own pocket , @entity1 recommends that women undergo a mammogram every other year , along with an ultrasound			1
if you feel something or there is any uncertainty about the scan , she says , insist on an mri instead of a second mammogram			2
things would have turned out differently , she says , if she had accepted her clear mammogram report and not insisted on an ultrasound			1
the @entity15 recommends annual mammograms for women starting at age 40			0
@entity14 agrees that mammograms are not foolproof but cautions that ultrasound and @entity172 screenings are meant to get a better look at something , not to replace a mammogram			2
have a positive attitude @entity1 decided right away that she would not let her diagnosis dominate her life			1
she focused on the things she enjoys in life and maintained her daily routine			0
" i thought , if i stop and change my routine , i give this thing more power , " she said			0
there 's no doubt that having a positive attitude helps in terms of quality of life , @entity14 says			2
the jury is still out on whether it prolongs life			0
stay off the internet " if ever you are diagnosed with something , never read the @entity193 , " @entity1 concluded after spending an afternoon reading some websites about thyroid cancer before her surgery			1
" it was negative ; it was horrible ; it was pitiful			0
i said , ' no , i am not going to be like these people			0
' it was pretty depressing , and i just decided no , this is not who i am			0
i never conquered anything in my life this way , and it 's not going to be this either			2
" though @entity14 says it 's an individual decision , he says people should be careful about where they seek information online and ensure that it 's a reputable source such as the @entity216			2
when , not if @entity1 believes that a sea change is needed on how cancer is viewed : people should think of it as " you are going to get cancer , so how can you stay on top of tests and getting checked and getting monitored so you are diagnosed earlier ? " most cancers are curable at stage 1 or 2			1
@entity226 says this preventive approach applies not just to cancer to but to all illnesses and conditions			2
" you 're going to catch something , and you have to be prepared , " she said			0
meanwhile , @entity1 says , do n't put off fun			2
" do n't wait to retire to do all the fun things you want to do			0
