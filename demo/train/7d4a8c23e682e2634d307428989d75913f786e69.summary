-- strikes and counterstrikes between @entity3 and @entity4 resumed as talks aimed at agreeing to a longer - term truce fell apart			1
since the temporary ceasefire crumbled tuesday , at least 137 rockets have been launched from @entity10 , the @entity3 military said			1
of those , 94 hit @entity3 and 24 were intercepted			2
sirens warning of rocket fire repeatedly wailed above the @entity14 , @entity15 and other @entity3 communities on wednesday			2
one rocket struck a home in the @entity20 area but no injuries were reported			0
@entity3 has retaliated with airstrikes on @entity10 , attacking some 80 suspected militant sites			2
the attacks have killed 23 people and injured more than 130 , the @entity24 said wednesday			1
@entity4 said one such strike targeted @entity28 , the head of its armed wing , the @entity30			1
it killed @entity28 's wife and 7 - month - old son instead , the @entity24 said			1
but @entity33 , deputy head of @entity4 ' politburo , said wednesday that @entity28 was not killed and is " in a safe place			1
" the @entity3 military said it was looking into the claim			2
@entity38 , a senior spokesman for @entity4 , posted on @entity39 that @entity3 would " pay a heavy price " for its " crimes against @entity43 civilians			1
" he said the conflict around @entity10 would not end unless @entity28 decided it should and unless @entity3 committed to halting violence and lifting its siege of the territory			2
the @entity30 warned international airlines to refrain from landing at or taking off from @entity49 in the @entity3 city of @entity51 starting 6 a.m. local time thursday ( 11 p.m. et wednesday )			2
the statement was aired wednesday by the @entity43 outlet @entity55			0
the blame game as has been the case throughout the conflict , each side blamed the other for the collapse of the ceasefire and failure of peace talks			0
@entity3 's military resumed airstrikes tuesday afternoon after it said three rockets were fired into @entity3 from @entity10			2
@entity4 denied involvement in firing the rockets			2
the truce had been due to last until midnight tuesday			0
the talks in @entity72 were bound to be difficult because of what they tried to achieve			1
@entity3 wanted @entity10 to be demilitarized , demanding that @entity4 , which controls the territory , and other militant groups lay down their arms			1
palestinians wanted @entity3 's blockade to end , saying it is strangling the economy of the small , impoverished strip of land and the lives of its inhabitants			2
senior @entity4 official @entity85 , who was involved in the negotiations in @entity72 , said wednesday that the @entity3 negotiated in bad faith and never intended to a make a deal			1
" the @entity3 delegation was not serious enough to achieve a deal , and was evasive and did not respond to any of our demands , and , therefore , they are the ones who are responsible for the failure of these negotiations , " he said			0
the @entity43 called for the easing of the blockade while postponing their demands to reopen an airport and a seaport for the territory , but the @entity3 never responded to the proposal , he said			0
instead , the @entity3 side continued to insist on the demilitarization of @entity10 , something the @entity43 have long said they will never agree too , @entity85 said			0
the @entity3 authorities -- who retain control of @entity10 's airspace , @entity111 waters and their shared border -- say releasing their grip on what goes into and out of the territory is n't feasible while @entity4 and other groups are still building up their arsenals of weapons			1
@entity3 blamed @entity10 militants for breaking the truce			0
but it was unclear exactly what happened			0
in one interpretation , the @entity3 left @entity72 after they gave up on negotiations			1
in another interpretation , the @entity3 took the newest proposal home with them to share with their government			0
" we did not seek this war			0
@entity3 imposed this war on us and @entity3 resumed this war , and our people have no other choice but to remain steadfast and defend their families , " said @entity85			1
' worse to come ' @entity135 , a senior member of the @entity136 , told @entity137 on wednesday that the @entity3 government alone was responsible for the breakdown of the ceasefire			0
he accused @entity3 prime minister @entity141 of " sabotaging every effort as he did always " in the search for peace			1
appealing for an international effort to protect @entity10 , provide aid to its beleaguered citizens and establish a @entity43 state , @entity135 said he feared that " worse is still to come			0
" @entity141 fired back in comments to @entity4 , also on wednesday			1
" our policy is simple : if you shoot , you will get attacked , " he warned			0
" if you try more , you will get double			0
if @entity4 does not understand that today , ( it ) will tomorrow			0
and if not tomorrow , the day after			0
" @entity3 will not stop its efforts against @entity4 " until we can ensure full safety and security " for people in @entity3 's south , the prime minister said			1
if @entity4 thinks otherwise , @entity141 said , it is mistaken			1
the latest conflict , which began in early july , has killed more than 2,000 palestinians , leaving entire @entity10 neighborhoods in rubble			0
the violence has killed 67 people on the @entity3 side , with militants in @entity10 firing roughly 3,500 rockets toward @entity3			1
