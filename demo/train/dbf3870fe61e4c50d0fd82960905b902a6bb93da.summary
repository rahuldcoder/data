-- it 's been nine months since pop music superstar @entity2 passed away , but her legacy continues to live on via television musical tributes , a recently released @entity6 compilation , the @entity8 release of her final film work , " @entity11 , " and a critically panned reality show starring her family members			1
" these projects are just some of the things that are a continuation of her legacy , " said her sister - in - law / manager , @entity15			1
" they 're showing @entity2 in a very beautiful light			1
for the past 10 years or more , it has been very turbulent with the media and her personal life			0
" in the time leading up to her death , negative media attention plagued @entity2 , who was one of the best - selling artists of all time			1
a new book of photographs aims to shine a more positive light on her legacy			1
released last week , it 's called , " @entity2 : a tribute to @entity39			1
" curated by acclaimed photographer @entity41 , the oversized book features over 130 images of @entity2 captured by 22 world - class shutterbugs : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 are just a few who shot her over the past 30 years			1
@entity2 's storied career : a regal rise , a tragic fall with a 30 - plus year career in the music business , the @entity56 based photographer -- who first met the pop superstar at the @entity58 while she was filming " @entity59 " -- was entrusted by @entity2 's estate to handle the daunting task			1
" to know her is to love her through and through and when i was looking through the thousands of photographs that was sent for the book , they were all amazing , " @entity64 told @entity0			2
with just six weeks to complete " @entity71 " -- the book publisher wanted to make sure it was in stores during the holiday season -- @entity64 and her team combed through archives from various sources to obtain the perfect images for the project			1
the book showcases the " @entity86 " chanteuse in work mode : at photo shoots , in concert , at video shoots , movie stills , etc. and according to @entity64 , that was the intention			2
" in this book , i did not think we should have any pictures of anyone but @entity2			1
it 's a tribute to her and it 's of her professional side , her career , her 30 years of being an iconic artist			2
" but two of the pics do involve other people			0
one features an unseen @entity101 , @entity2 's longtime mentor and one features child @entity103 -- the last page of the book			1
" that day i remember really well , " @entity106 recalled			1
" it was shot at the @entity108 and i was shooting all of them			0
i shot amazing pictures of @entity2 and ( @entity111 ) too			2
it was a very good time in their relationship			0
and they were both in great spirits			0
but it was the way that @entity2 looked at her in that picture and the way @entity103 was focused on her , i feel that it captured the connection , obviously some kind of karmic connection of not between just a mother and a child but between two souls			2
and i thought it was s such a poignant moment and it was so full of joy and they seem so content and so complete and i thought it was a nice way to end the book			0
that was her heart right there			0
" photos : never - seen photos of a young @entity2 according to @entity15 , who also oversees @entity2 's estate , @entity106 was one of @entity2 's most beloved photographers , one she called on regularly			1
and after seeing her work on the @entity144 coffee - table book , " 21 nights , " she knew she was the right person for the job			1
" it was a no - brainer , " @entity15 said			1
" she did a phenomenal job			0
" @entity64 , who has worked with countless music stars and directs music videos , was reluctant to do another musician book			2
" when you 've done a book with @entity144 you 've already done it , " she said			0
" but because i love @entity2 so much , i thought why do n't i do something with a broader scope			2
it should n't just be about my 20 - something year relationship with @entity2 , it should be about @entity2 over the last 30 years of her career and it 's much broader than me because she worked with many photographers			1
even though she and i had a total love-fest , there are other opportunities for other people who 've shot her			0
" according to @entity15 , all of the photographers -- who contributed the work at no cost -- graciously worked closely with @entity64 in the tight time frame			1
aside from writing the poignant @entity176 to the book , @entity101 , who reigned supreme as the chief executive hit - maker at @entity180 for 30 years , even had some input			2
@entity106 called on the legendary music executive for advice and to make sure " she got it right " once it was in the finishing stages			1
" it was a really an emotional journey for him , " she said			0
" he said it was like looking at his life , ' this is my whole life right here			0
' he said to me , ' i really want to make sure that we capture those really important , poignant moments in her life			0
' the one thing he added was pictures from ' the bodyguard			0
' other than that , we 'd gotten it all			0
" @entity15 could n't be more proud of " @entity71			2
" " we 've been talking abut a book for quite some time and this is a continuation of one of the projects that we wanted to do and it 's for the fans , an enclosure , " she said			2
" she was such a beautiful , beautiful person physically and had such a gift , a @entity213 given gift			0
we wanted the pages , the photography to remind them of who she really was			0
" " i hope they can really enjoy it for years and pass it on for generation after generation			0
" people we 've lost in 2012 : the lives they lived			0
