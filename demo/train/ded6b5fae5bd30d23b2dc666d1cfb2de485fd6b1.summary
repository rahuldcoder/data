the @entity1 diet , which advocates steering away from carbs , may not lead to long - term weight loss			1
a @entity5 study , released in may 2007 in the @entity6 , compares the effectiveness of four popular diets -- @entity1 , @entity9 ( lifestyle , @entity11 , @entity12 , relationships , and @entity14 ) , @entity15 , and @entity16 -- for women who are premenopausal and overweight or obese			1
women on @entity1 lost the most weight , although the average loss was only about 10 pounds for 12 months			1
what 's the best diet ? dr. @entity23 , @entity24 chief medical correspondent : it 's always difficult to know which diet is right for you			0
researchers at @entity5 looked at four popular diets : @entity1 , @entity9 , @entity15 , and the @entity16			2
three hundred overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomly assigned to these four diets , which they followed for a year			0
women in the @entity32 lost the most weight -- about 10 pounds in a year			0
it 's also interesting to note that more participants stayed on the @entity1 diet for the entire year , compared with women on the other diets			2
but even though these women lost weight , is n't the whole issue about @entity1 that it 's high in fats that can raise your cholesterol , which might eventually lead to heart problems ? @entity23 : researchers also looked at the good and bad cholesterol and blood pressure of each participant			1
@entity1 patients had a few points higher number for their ldl or bad cholesterol , but overall there was no significant difference			2
and the @entity1 patients had a higher blood pressure number but , again , not that much higher			0
what about for the long term ? can they keep the weight off with @entity1 ? @entity23 : first off , although any doctor will tell you it 's good for most people to lose 10 pounds , 10 pounds is not a significant amount of weight to lose in one year			1
the study does not follow the patients after the year , so you do n't know whether they gained their weight back , or whether they lost more			0
also , other nutritionists we talked to who have worked on this same type of research said that the only real difference in diets was between @entity1 and the @entity16			0
all the others had pretty much the same results			0
and they found while @entity1 can be an effective way to lose weight , few people are able to maintain meaningful long - term weight loss on this diet .			1

bottom line : @entity1 can help you lose weight , but few people are able to maintain meaningful long - term weight loss with it
