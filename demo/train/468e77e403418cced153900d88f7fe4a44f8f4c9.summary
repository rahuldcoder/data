-- an unprecedented global crime wave threatens the most important natural places on @entity3 and we are failing in our efforts to stop it			1
look past the drug wars , the counterfeiting industry and human trafficking and you 'll find one of the next biggest criminal enterprises in the world : the trade in illicit wildlife			1
trafficking in wildlife and its body parts is exploding in popularity among global crime syndicates			1
unlike other illicit trades , killing and selling parts from rhinos , tigers and elephants holds advantages for criminals : the product is poorly protected at its source , its trade is poorly regulated and wildlife crime is poorly investigated and lightly punished			1
for a hardcore criminal , illicit wildlife trafficking is a low - risk , high - reward bonanza			1
news : @entity38 poaching hits record numbers in @entity40 an analysis released tuesday and commissioned by the @entity42 -- based on interviews with governments , military and civil society leaders -- underscores that illicit wildlife trafficking is not just an environmental problem , but a transnational crime issue			1
it compromises the security of countries and destroys natural wealth			1
@entity54 and other law enforcement groups agree that the involvement of organized crime syndicates and rebel militias in wildlife crime to fund their activities and purchase weapons has increased			1
it also highlights that black market wildlife trade hinders sustainable , social and economic development			1
the violent nature of poaching reduces the effectiveness of governments , erodes the rule of law and affects the growth of local communities			2
authorities estimate the illegal wildlife trade to be worth up to $ 10 billion annually -- or almost $ 20 billion if you count the illegal trade in timber and fisheries products			1
that puts it among the top illegal trades in the world			0
as a direct consequence of these profits , the killings are way up : @entity40 loses tens of thousands of elephants each year for their ivory , wild tiger populations have plummeted to as few as 3,200 and rhino poaching in @entity40 is exploding			0
news : booming illegal ivory trade taking severe toll on @entity40 's elephants for years @entity40 boasted low rates of rhino poaching , with approximately 20 rhinos killed annually			2
in the past five years , the number has soared exponentially ; 618 rhinos have been poached in 2012			0
@entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 drive much of the illegal wildlife demand but we should n't forget that @entity103 are complicit in this trade			1
after @entity99 , the @entity103 may be the second largest market for wildlife products in the world , a significant percentage of which is illegal , including illicit ivory trinkets being sold in @entity111 and international rhino horn trafficking rings operating out of @entity113			1
we 're going to lose this fight if we do n't up our game			0
we need solutions as sophisticated as the criminals we face			0
crime syndicates employ helicopters , night vision equipment and high capacity automatic weapons			0
park rangers are vastly outgunned and often outmanned			2
there is a way forward that offers some hope			0
secretary of state @entity126 has made this a strategic imperative for @entity103 interests around the world , emphasizing it as a major national security issue , and we are beginning to engage other governments in this discussion			2
it goes far beyond the loss of animals			0
poaching decreases food security for rural communities , and evidence points to the sale of ivory as a means of funding rebel militias in places like @entity147			1
news : thousands of crocodiles rescued from smugglers in @entity99 the private sector is taking notice			0
@entity153 just announced a signature charity giving initiative , funding @entity42 in the development of cutting - edge technologies to help us detect and track both animals and poachers on the ground			0
this project will develop a new surveillance approach to greatly increase enforcement effectiveness by intercepting the poachers before they can do harm			0
this is a step in the right direction , but we 'll need governments to build not just the capacity but also the resolve to apply the technology and enforcement at a much greater scale			2
across the world , we need to strengthen criminal investigation , prosecution and sentencing on wildlife crime			1
that means more money and resources for law enforcement to support , for example , specialized investigative and forensic methodologies			0
simultaneously , we need awareness - raising campaigns to reduce demand , especially among consumers in @entity188 , and to use the best available market research to guide social media campaigns			0
we need governments on both the supply and demand side of this trade to work together and bring serious commitments to the table in march , when representatives for some 170 nations will come together in @entity100 -- itself a major market for illegal ivory -- for the @entity201			1
here they will aim to make good on the promises to get a handle on this epidemic			0
a major litmus test of the convention will be the nations ' ability to make convincing commitments to address all aspects of the crisis			0
news : photographer documents trafficking of endangered animals in @entity188 we can roll back this wave of crime , but we 're far from making that happen			0
there are promising signs but we will need a sustained tenfold increase in efforts from consumers , communities , the private sector , and most importantly , from governments to stop the slaughter before it 's too late			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			2

@entity232 : wildlife trade a growing global criminal enterprise poorly addressed
it 's an environmental problem and world crime issue , destroys nations ' natural wealth
he says rebel militias , organized crime use funds from illicit wildlife trade ; rangers outgunned
@entity230 : governments must use technology , enforcement to stem supply and demand
