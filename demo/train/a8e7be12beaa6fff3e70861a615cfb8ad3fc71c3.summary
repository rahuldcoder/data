@entity0 -- amid criticism from his @entity5 opponent that his foreign policy " projects weakness , " president @entity2 confronted @entity6 and @entity7 on tuesday and warned those who killed an @entity10 diplomat in @entity11 that they would be held accountable			1
" the attacks on our civilians in @entity18 were attacks on @entity10 , " @entity2 told the @entity14			1
" there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice			0
" both @entity5 presidential candidate @entity23 and running mate rep. @entity24 of @entity25 have in recent days challenged @entity2 's foreign policy record , which is perceived to be a strength for the incumbent			1
@entity2 confronts @entity6 , @entity7 ; @entity14 debate opens in the battleground state of @entity31 on monday , @entity23 said @entity2 's characterization of the recent unrest in the @entity34 as a " bump in the road " belittled the gravity of the attack on the @entity10 @entity39 in @entity18 on september 11 that killed ambassador @entity40 and three other @entity10			1
" bumps in the road ? " @entity23 asked			2
" we had an ambassador assassinated			0
we had a @entity46 member elected to the presidency of @entity48			0
twenty thousand people have been killed in @entity7			0
we have tumult in @entity51 and , of course , @entity6 is that much closer to having the capacity to build a nuclear weapon			0
" @entity23 hammers @entity2 on ' bumps in the road ' @entity24 said during a bus tour through the swing state of @entity59 that @entity2 's policies " project weakness			1
" " when you project @entity10 weakness - the superpower projecting weakness - that creates a vacuum , that creates a void , " @entity24 added			1
" that void gets filled by people in countries who do not share our interests			0
it means our adversaries are that much more tempted to test us and our allies are much less likely to trust us , like @entity77			0
" @entity79 majority leader @entity78 told reporters in a conference call on monday organized by the @entity23 campaign that the absence of any bilateral meetings at the @entity14 , including with @entity77 prime minister @entity85 , demonstrated an unwillingness to engage on issues that could become pitfalls for @entity10 diplomacy			1
@entity85 has pressed the @entity10 for a stronger line on @entity6 and @entity2 clarified his position on the issue in his @entity14 remarks			1
" @entity10 wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy , and we believe that there is still time and space to do so , " the president said			2
" but that time is not unlimited			0
" " make no mistake , " he continued , " a nuclear - armed @entity6 is not a challenge that can be contained			0
" the president praised the @entity11 government for its cooperation in investigating the attacks that killed @entity40 , but he defended freedom of speech -- the unrest in the @entity46 world grew out of a film produced in the @entity10 that mocked the @entity111			2
" the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression it is more speech , " @entity2 said adding that , " there is no speech that justifies mindless violence			2
" slain envoy 's legacy ' will live on in the lives he touched ' @entity123 hosts @entity2 and @entity23 @entity23 continued the conversation about the @entity34 , albeit in a less confrontational way , when he spoke at the @entity126 on tuesday , tying his plan for economic development through trade and free enterprise to stability in the region			1
" religious extremism is certainly part of the problem , " @entity23 said of the tension and violence in the @entity34			2
" but that 's not the whole story			0
" citing the @entity141 fruit vendor who set himself on fire and sparked the @entity144 , @entity23 said the vendor who was humiliated by government forces wanted to provide for his family			2
the freedom of an individual to work , @entity23 said , is at the core of his foreign aid plan			2
that must be at the heart of our effort to help people build economies that can create jobs for people , young and old alike , " @entity23 said			2
@entity23 makes @entity123 joke -- in front of @entity123 when @entity23 addressed the @entity123 event , he unveiled what his campaign calls his " @entity166 , " a re-engineering of the way @entity10 approaches foreign assistance			1
@entity23 's plan ties @entity10 trade policy to development in foreign nations by identifying barriers to trade and investment in developing countries			1
if the countries cooperated in working to remove the barriers , then @entity23 's plan would open trade to the countries and deliver development packages focusing on strengthening basic tenants of democracy			2
@entity23 lays out ' aid with trade ' in major foreign policy speech following his remarks at the @entity14 , @entity2 addressed the @entity186 on human trafficking , saying it " must be called by its true name -- modern slavery			1
" the president signed an executive order on tuesday to strengthen protections so that federal contractors are n't using forced labor			0
@entity2 said the order raised the bar			2
" in short , we 're making clear that @entity10 tax dollars must never , ever be used to support the trafficking of human beings , " he said			2
the @entity202 : ending modern - day slavery @entity2 's remarks also may resonate with @entity205 since human trafficking is an issue that many churches in that community have organized to fight			2
rescuing girls from sex slavery is also an issue that may resonate with some women voters			0
more than 20 million men , women and children are victims of human trafficking worldwide , according to the executive order			0
@entity2 called on countries worldwide to enact and enforce laws preventing and punishing human trafficking			0

" we can survive a lot , " @entity2 answered , saying he thought @entity23 was a good man and means well			1
" but the @entity10 people do n't want to just survive			1
i 've just got a different vision of how we grow an economy			0
we grow fastest when the middle class is doing well , " @entity2 said			0
the @entity240 also talked about their relationship			0
the couple says that instead of the presidency making their relationship tougher , it has brought them closer together			0

" @entity224 : i can make the president mad still , he said the weight of the office taught them to " talk the big stuff but do n't sweat the small stuff			1
