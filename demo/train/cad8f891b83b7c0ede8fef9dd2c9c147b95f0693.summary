@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 judge dismissed a batch of potential jurors in the @entity7 murder trial tuesday because several members had discussed the case in the jury room			1

@entity12 asked the individuals whether another potential juror talked or asked about the case , and whether it went beyond just a reference to the case			2
at least a dozen raised their hand when asked if someone had spoken to them about @entity7			2

@entity12 tied the jury panel problem to a person , listed as a witness in the case , who had also been summoned for jury duty			1
that individual spoke with others in the jury room , the judge said			2
concerns over @entity16 receiving a fair trial led to the jury selection proceedings being moved to the @entity0 , @entity1 , courthouse , about 100 miles southwest of @entity54			1
@entity7 's grandmother first reported her missing in @entity54 in 2008 , weeks after the girl was last seen , and five months before her body was found			1

on a lighter note , a woman claimed hardship tuesday due to her concern about a teen son who lives at home and worries about another son , 29 , possibly throwing parties while she is on duty			0
jurors also will be asked , one by one , for their take on the death penalty , which @entity7 would be eligible for if convicted on the murder charge			1
