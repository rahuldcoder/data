-- a multistate kidnapping targeting a @entity4 prosecutor turns out to be a complicated web of mistaken identity and intrigue , court documents show			1
nine people stand accused of participating in a conspiracy to kidnap a @entity11 assistant district attorney who had prosecuted @entity12 in 2012			2
but one of the suspects bungled an internet search and came up with an address for her father , 63 - year - old @entity17 , who was kidnapped earlier this month and abused before being rescued from an @entity19 apartment five days later			1
the plot seemingly begins and ends with @entity12 , according to a federal indictment handed down from the @entity22 for the @entity23 of @entity4 on tuesday			1
after a jury convicted @entity12 of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill , he was sentenced to life in prison without parole at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity4			1
it was there , federal documents say , that @entity12 obtained a cell phone and contacted @entity38 and @entity39 , accused of orchestrating the scheme			2
@entity12 instructed @entity42 and @entity43 to " assemble a team to travel to @entity4 and kidnap the ( assistant district attorney ) , " the indictment says			1
" @entity42 used the @entity47 to research what she thought was the address of the @entity51 , " federal documents say			0
" unbeknownst to @entity42 , she had actually found the address of the @entity51 's father			1
" @entity12 oversaw the four - member kidnapping team with a heavy hand , documents say , even instructing each person on their specific role during the abduction and advising them to wear khakis and collared shirts			1
on april 5 , the team left @entity65 and arrived at @entity17 's home in @entity67			2
one kidnapper stayed with the car			0
two more , armed with a handgun and stun gun , lay in wait , while the fourth knocked on the door with a clipboard in hand , according to the indictment			0
when @entity17 opened the door , the assailants " forced their way into the house and abducted him , " the indictment reads			2
@entity17 was shocked with the stun gun , pistol - whipped , then restrained and forced into the car for the drive back to @entity65			0
the ride was not pleasant			0
" the @entity51 's father was forced to remain lying on the backseat floorboard and a blanket was put over his body , " the indictment says			1
kidnapping suspects @entity98 and @entity99 " also restrained the victim with handcuffs , pistol whipped him , and used the stun gun on him dozens of times			0
" @entity17 would remain held against his will at an apartment complex in @entity19 , taped to a chair inside a closet , for the next several days , the indictment says			2
on april 7 , @entity12 dictated text messages to one of his accomplices to send to @entity17 's wife , according to court documents			1
" we will send him back to you in 6 boxes , and every chance we get we will take someone in you [ sic ] family to @entity118 [ sic ] and torture them and kill them , we will do a drive by and gun down anybody in you [ sic ] family and we will throw grenades in you [ sic ] window , " read one text , according to the indictment			0
the messages ordered that " various demands benefiting @entity12 must be satisfied , " the document said , and warned that harm would come to more family members and the prosecutor herself if " cooperation was not forthcoming			0
" a photo of @entity17 , tied to a chair in a closet , was sent to @entity17 's wife two days later , along with another text : " tomorrow we call you again an [ sic ] if you can not tell me where my things are at tomorrow i will start torchering [ sic ]			0
" the kidnappers did not know the authorities were by then aware that @entity12 was allegedly masterminding the abduction from his jail cell and that the @entity144 was already watching two homes in @entity65 where members of the plot were staying			1
that evening , @entity12 received a chilling text message , court documents show : " we got car , spot , and shovel			0
" after @entity12 allegedly exchanged texts with his co-conspirators ordering them to kill @entity17 , bury him and cover up the crime , authorities moved in , the documents say			1
just before midnight , the @entity144 rescued @entity17 , and by the next morning , most members of the kidnapping plot were in custody			1
on wednesday , @entity43 , the only member of the conspiracy who was n't in custody when the indictment was filed tuesday , surrendered to the @entity144 in @entity19 and had a first appearance in court			0
