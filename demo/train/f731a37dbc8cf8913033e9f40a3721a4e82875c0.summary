@entity0 , @entity1 -- the long , complicated legal road for @entity5 players and owners kicked off in a federal courtroom wednesday , as both sides made their case for and against lifting a lockout that could delay the start of the football season			1
at the conclusion of the hearing , judge @entity13 said she expected to make a decision in a couple of weeks			1
the lockout is the result of an ongoing dispute between the @entity5 owners and the players who failed to reach a collective - bargaining agreement last month			1
@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and seven other players have filed a lawsuit on behalf of other current and eligible @entity5 players against the league to halt the lockout , which could affect the start of the 2011 - 12 season scheduled for september 8			1
what to expect from @entity22 v. @entity5 they want a preliminary injunction to block the lockout			1
the players also want a future trial to determine if the @entity5 lockout is in violation of federal antitrust laws			1
in his opening statement to the judge , the players ' attorney @entity39 stressed the players face " irreparable harm " to their careers , income and health , if a preliminary injunction is not granted			2
@entity5 attorney @entity49 disagreed with that position			1
" they say there is irreparable harm , we say there is not , " @entity49 told the judge			2
" there are numerous factual disagreements between the parties			0
" @entity58 asked several times whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary to resolve the factual disputes			0
but @entity39 said , among other things , that would only " delay " this process			0
the players present in the courtroom were @entity66 of the @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 of the @entity70 , @entity71 of the @entity72 , draft - eligible @entity75 linebacker @entity74 and retired @entity5 player @entity73			1
on monday , @entity58 agreed to combine @entity22 v. @entity5 with another class - action lawsuit , @entity73 v. @entity5 , filed in march by a group primarily made up of retired @entity5 players			1
that second lawsuit is " potentially more threatening " because the plaintiffs in @entity73 v. @entity5 are not bargaining members of the @entity5 's players union , the @entity83 , or @entity83 , and the @entity5 can not argue that they engaged in bad faith during collective - bargaining discussions , according to @entity87 's legal analyst @entity86			1
" the @entity83 may be removed from the picture in @entity73 v. @entity5 , a point which would take away a key defense the @entity5 enjoys in @entity22 v. @entity5 , " @entity86 said			1
last month , negotiations between the @entity5 and players union aimed at preventing a work stoppage broke down			1
by giving up their collective - bargaining rights , the players could file individual antitrust suits against the league and the owners			0
that move set the stage for a lengthy legal battle with owners			0
at the time , the @entity5 accused the union of walking away from " a very good deal on the table			1
" if the players are locked out from playing in september , it would be the first @entity5 work stoppage since 1987 , with months of labor and legal maneuvering for football fans already confused about how a $ 9 billion industry lacks enough money to satisfy everyone			2
@entity5 prepares players for lockout the heart of the issue between the players and the owners is how to divide the league 's $ 9 billion in revenue			1
right now , @entity5 owners take $ 1 billion off the top of that revenue stream			2
after that , the players get about 60 %			0
the owners say that the current labor deal does n't take into account the rising costs related to building stadiums and promoting the game			0
the players argue that the league has not sufficiently opened up its books to prove this point			0
in addition , the owners also want to increase the season by two games , which some players are against because of the risk of injuries			0
while star players earn millions of dollars each year , the median @entity5 salary is $ 790,000 and the average career lasts about four years			2
a lockout also affects the league 's employees : the receptionists , ticket salespeople and stadium workers			0
the @entity155 have announced that they will require all business - side employees to take a one - week unpaid leave each month during any lockout			0
poll : who do you think is to blame ? the lockout will not stop the @entity164 , which will proceed as scheduled on april 28 - 30 , the league said			0
all other regular off - season activity would cease , threatening to delay or cancel the start of the new season			2
the teams might approach the draft a bit differently in the midst of a lockout , according to @entity173 , a sports columnist for @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity176			0
" @entity177 might ( pick ) based on needs rather than the best players available , because who knows when they 'll be able to address those needs on the free - agent market , " @entity173 said			0
it is possible for the @entity5 season to go forward with replacement players , but analyst @entity86 said that is not likely : " practical and legal hurdles would make doing so extremely unlikely , " he said			1
but it 's still a possibility			0
" the @entity5 might argue that if @entity5 players wo n't accept the league 's best @entity191 ( collective - bargaining agreement ) offer , the league has no choice but to resume games with other players who are willing to play , " he added			2
@entity2 's @entity198 reported from @entity199 , and @entity200 reported from @entity0 .			0
