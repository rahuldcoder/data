-- a funny thing happened to " @entity2 " on its way to its seventh season			1
it became just another tv show			1
the series about a 1960s ad agency that intersects with the @entity10 experience spent its sixth season wading through the shocks of 1968 -- the @entity11 , the assassinations of @entity14 and @entity15 , the presidential race that culminated in the election of @entity18			2
what the late ' 60s really looked like but reviewers found the season flat and disconnected compared to previous seasons , with @entity24 's @entity23 declaring it " sluggish and lumpy and unfocused " and @entity26 's @entity25 describing it as " a strange season in that it seemed to throw up intriguing plot possibilities and then grow quickly bored with them			1
" which is not to say that the show jumped the shark as viewers prepare for season 7 , the show 's last , which begins sunday on @entity36			1
it was still a very good tv show , still rewarded with @entity39 nominations and cultural cachet			1
viewers and reviewers still parsed its every symbol , from the elevators in protagonist @entity46 's apartment building to the t - shirt worn by his wife , @entity49 ( @entity48 )			2
viewers will want to know if some of the questions raised by @entity53 are answered			0
will @entity46 's marriage hold up ? after an affair was discovered by his daughter @entity56 , can he repair the relationship with her ? @entity46 ( @entity58 ) also ended the season on the outs with @entity2 -- the agency at the heart of the show -- where he was creative director			1
indeed , a lot of figures at @entity2 are coping with uncertainty : @entity67 ( @entity68 ) , who spent season 6 away from -- and then rejoining -- the agency ; @entity71 ( @entity70 ) , whose marriage hit the skids ; and @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , who keeps staring mortality in the face ( and cracking jokes in its shadows )			1
and then , of course , there 's the mysterious @entity83 ( @entity84 ) , the eager salesman who turned out to be a pro at snowing his colleagues			2
how will he fare with that big @entity88 account ? for all that , " @entity2 " just was n't the phenomenon it was during its first four years , when the very title " @entity2 " became synonymous with the idea of " @entity15 - era @entity10			1
" when " @entity2 " premiered in 2007 , " there was n't anything comparable in look , " said style consultant and beauty expert @entity94 , whose book " @entity97 ! " focuses in part on the " @entity2 " era			2
" modern television and especially cable did n't have anything like it -- that stylized look , that way of speaking			2
everyone felt sophisticated talking about it			0
" it did n't hurt that the show addressed issues , such as sexism and image - making , through the prism of an era that seemed even more distant than it was , adds @entity119 , a history professor at @entity121 's @entity120			1
the show quickly became a shorthand for a different kind of @entity10 -- one remembered for its hard - drinking men , subordinate women and cigarettes everywhere -- than the one we live in now			1
it was a different @entity10 than the one that existed in the late ' 60s , for that matter			0
" for us , 1962 is much more of a foreign country than 1968 , because 1968 is basically who we are now , and 1962 is who we were , " @entity119 said			0
part of the language those early seasons of " @entity2 " managed to work themselves into the water - cooler conversation with surprising ease			1
any journalist looking to compare our muddled times with the tie - clipped , flouncy - skirted early ' 60s invoked " @entity2			1
" handsome , inscrutable types were " @entity154 , " after @entity58 's lead character , an ad agency creative director ; upscale , quietly desperate housewives were " @entity153 , " after his eventual ex-wife , played by @entity152			0
single career women ? meet @entity67 ( @entity68 )			0
@entity158 and @entity159 introduced " @entity2 " - inspired fashion lines , the name " @entity157 " became popular again , and -- since imitation is the sincerest form of television , to borrow @entity165 's old line -- the show 's sleek era was suddenly all over the tube , featured on such programs as " @entity170 , " " @entity171 " and " @entity172			1
" dressing like ' @entity2 ' that period of " @entity2 " became part of the language			2
" it 's time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a ' @entity2 ' episode , " said president @entity176 in his 2014 @entity178 address , and nobody had to ask what he meant			1
" it 's rare that the name of the show becomes a shorthand for an era , " said @entity119 , noting that " @entity2 " now represents the early ' 60s in the way that " @entity185 " or " @entity186 " represent the 1950s			1
where to find " @entity2 's " classic cocktails indeed , for a show that 's never enjoyed the mammoth ratings of @entity36 stablemate " @entity198 , " it 's had an impact well beyond its audience			1
" @entity2 " averaged less than a million viewers per episode in its first season			1
it was n't until the fourth season that it topped 2 million , and last season 's ratings , for the show 's sixth season , averaged about 2.5 million			1
compare that to " @entity198 , " which averaged 13.3 million for its most recent season -- and grabbed 15.7 million for its season 4 finale			2
even the broadcast networks would be thrilled with that			0
" @entity2 " grabbed this attention despite criticism that it had oversimplified a complex era -- and that , in turn , today 's news media was doing the same			1
" from where i sit , claiming this exasperating show is even remotely representative of the times we lived through would be like trying to show ' dynasty ' on the @entity227 ! " exclaimed ad man and art director @entity220 in a @entity0 opinion piece			0
" ' @entity2 ' is nothing more than the fulfillment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s bundled up nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters is glamorous and ' vintage			1
' " but that does n't surprise @entity94			0
after all , she points out , tv tends to be aspirational			0
" it is n't real life , " she said			0
" it 's very stylized			0
" paving the way " @entity2 " creator @entity243 has tried to make a similar point			2
" i know this sounds like a joke , " he told the wrap last year , " but none of it is real			0
" at the least , all the talk helped " @entity2 " make the world safe for the rule of basic cable			1
" for a long time it was just @entity255 , " @entity253 , who plays @entity46 's rival @entity254 , told @entity0			0
" when this show came on the air on @entity36 , no one had heard of @entity36 other than ( it being ) @entity36			0
i think the show led the way for @entity261 having their own series , @entity263 having their own series			0
i think it 's paved that road			0
" even if " @entity2 " has lost its place in the zeitgeist -- the @entity158 partnership is gone and " @entity271 " is the talked - about show of the moment ( for now , anyway ) -- it still has a loyal audience			1
@entity36 is counting on it			0
after the final season of " @entity277 " worked out so well by being split in two , the network announced the same practice would be put in place for " @entity2			1
" so sunday 's premiere introduces season 7 , part 1			2
as in the past , @entity243 and @entity36 are asking for a cone of silence to be placed around advance discussion of the premiere			0
not even the year can be revealed , though -- based on the publicity photographs showcasing miniskirts and sideburns -- it 's probably 1969 or 1970 , both of which would present opportunities for the show 's characters to intersect thematically with such historical events as the moon landing , the @entity297 murders , @entity298 , the @entity300 shootings and the @entity301			2
( well , it is mainly set in @entity303			0
) screenwriter @entity304 of " @entity306 " fame was added to the writing staff , and @entity308 , the great graphic artist , was drafted to create this year 's poster			0
if representing the more recognizable late ' 60s -- with its mixed - up , shook - up , psychedelic world -- means the show is less exotic to us , so be it			1
" it 's a sign of the show 's triumph and also its failure , " said @entity119			2
" when we remember the show , we 're going to remember the 1962 portion and we 're probably not going to remember the ' 67 and ' 68 portion because we 've been there and we 've done that			0
" @entity243 just wants it to be good			0
" i always feel pressure about entertaining the audience and keeping the show up to the level that we think it 's at and not repeating ourselves , " he told @entity0			2
but " @entity2 " being " @entity2 " -- and still having half a season to shoot -- he ca n't help thinking of the past , as well			1
it 's one thing to wonder about the ebb and flow of the 1960s , another to re-create its world			0
as the show heads into the sunset , he has visions of the beginning			0
" i have been thinking a little bit about sitting in a room , typing the title page and how this all happened , " he said .			0

" @entity2 's " seventh and final season begins sunday
show has become shorthand for referring to the early ' 60s
it helped *dictate* fashion , even made names popular
now it 's just a tv show -- but still *highly* thought - of
