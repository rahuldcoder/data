this week , @entity0 will take over the @entity2 , thanks to the @entity6 people 's overwhelming support in the 2014 elections , and our first priority for the next two years will be alleviating the economic pain the @entity6 people have experienced under the @entity13 administration			1
more than five years after the recession officially ended , too many @entity6 are still feeling the pinch			2
wages have remained stagnant , and median household income has dropped almost $ 3,000 on the president 's watch			2
meanwhile , prices for everything from groceries to education have risen			0
and instead of helping , most of the administration 's policies have had a negative impact on the economy			2
just last week we learned from an employer survey that a majority of small businesses say that @entity33 has reduced their profits , causing many of them to freeze or cut workers ' wages or reduce other benefits			2
despite all this , this week the president will be conducting a campaign - style tour in an attempt to claim credit for the sliver of positive economic news we 're finally seeing after six bleak years under his policies			0
unfortunately , the president 's attempted victory lap ca n't disguise the fact that our economy is still nowhere near where it should be			2
but there is reason to be hopeful			0
the new @entity59 majority will get right to work on job - creating legislation , starting with legislation to approve the @entity64 , which the president 's own @entity65 has admitted will support more than 42,000 jobs during construction			1
@entity64 enjoys bipartisan support in both houses of @entity71 , and i hope the president will finally sign off on this job - creating project			1
republicans will also take up two other bipartisan jobs measures that were stuck in the @entity77 - led @entity2 for far too long			1
we are committed to repealing the job - killing @entity33 medical device tax , a tax on life - saving medical devices like pacemakers and insulin pumps			1
this tax has already eliminated thousands of jobs in the medical device industry , and it 's on track to eliminate thousands more if it is n't repealed			1
given the economic stagnation of the past six years , the last thing our economy needs is a tax that is eliminating thousands of jobs			1
republicans will also work to repeal the @entity33 provision that changed the definition of full - time employment from 40 hours a week to 30 hours			0
this provision has forced countless businesses to cut back on hiring or reduce workers ' hours and wages , which has meant fewer jobs and opportunities for @entity6 workers			0
eliminating this provision has bipartisan support , and republicans look forward to taking it up this year			0
in addition to passing job - creating legislation , @entity0 will also make oversight a priority in the new @entity71			0
executive branch agencies have run amok over the past few years , and it 's time to rein them in			0
the @entity13 @entity117 , to name just one agency , has proposed regulations that would drive @entity6 ' energy prices through the roof and result in the loss of tens of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of @entity6 jobs			0
it is long past time for @entity71 to assert its oversight authority to protect @entity6 , particularly those who can least afford it , from this kind of executive overreach			0
while we hope to work with @entity131 as much as possible , the new @entity59 majority will not hesitate to draw bright lines between @entity77 and @entity59 priorities			1
@entity0 are committed to fundamental reforms , like transforming our tax code to make it simpler and fairer , cutting job - killing regulations and passing trade promotion authority so @entity6 goods can compete on an even playing field internationally			2
@entity0 are going to get @entity142 working for @entity6 again			0
under our control , the @entity2 will return to regular order , which means bills will be considered out in the open in committees before coming to the @entity2 floor , and all senators , regardless of party , will have a chance to propose and debate amendments			1
over the past few years of @entity77 control in the @entity2 , too often the minority party was shut out of the legislative process , leading to dysfunction and gridlock			1
under @entity59 control , the @entity2 will get back to work			1
creating jobs and encouraging economic growth should be bipartisan priorities , and we look forward to working with @entity131 on everything from repealing the job - killing medical device tax to approving the job - creating @entity64			1
we hope @entity131 and the president will join us .			0
