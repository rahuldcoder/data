@entity0 -- air traffic control towers staffed by private contractors are cheaper and provide the same level of safety as towers staffed by government controllers , a new government audit concludes			1
contract towers , as they are known , cost on average $ 537,000 a year to operate , compared with $ 2 million for comparably busy towers staffed by the @entity12 , according to the @entity14 's @entity13			1
in addition , the contract towers had a " significantly lower number and rate of safety incidents , " the report said			1
currently , 251 of the nation 's 374 towers are staffed by contractors who must meet @entity12 standards and are overseen by @entity12 managers			1
restricted to lower - volume airports , contract towers nonetheless handle 28 percent of all domestic airport operations			1
the @entity13 report likely will give ammunition to @entity33 lawmakers who favor the privatization of everything from airport control towers to security checkpoints			0
but it is unlikely to result in an expansion of tower contracting , coming on the heels of the re-election of a president with strong public sector support			0
the current hybrid system of contract - and government - staffed towers is a result of the decision by president @entity51 to fire the striking @entity53 controllers in 1981			1
after they were fired , the @entity12 moved its staff and managers to the busiest control towers , leaving smaller towers vacant			0
the next year , the @entity12 started the @entity59 , placing contractors at five low - activity towers			2
of the 251 contract towers in operation today , about half were previously staffed by @entity12 controllers , and half are new towers built by communities , typically to promote economic development			1
the new @entity13 audit compares 30 randomly selected contract towers to 30 comparable " low activity " @entity12 towers			2
the report notes a large difference in operating costs mainly due to lower staffing and salary levels at contract towers			1
contract towers had an average of six controllers , while @entity12 towers had 16			1
a typical contract controller near @entity87 , @entity88 , received a base salary of $ 56,000 per year compared with a base salary ranging from $ 63,000 to $ 85,000 a year for an @entity12 controller in @entity92 , @entity88 , the study said			2
contract towers also had a " significantly lower number and rate of safety incidents , " the report says			2
for example , 240 contract towers referenced in the review had 197 safety incidents , compared with 362 incidents at 92 similar @entity12 towers			1
the @entity104 , which represents @entity12 controllers and controllers at 63 contract towers , said it is wrong to conclude that the lower rate of safety incidents at contract towers means those towers are safer			1
@entity12 controllers fall under a non-punitive reporting system that encourages controllers to voluntarily report errors			0
" the @entity12 has a true safety culture , where all controllers and employees are encouraged to report all safety issues , including errors , while contract towers are dictated by a punitive culture that discourages controllers and their supervisors from reporting errors , " said @entity117 , a spokeswoman for the @entity104			1
an advocate for contract controllers disagreed that contract controllers were less likely to report errors			0
" the culture is that you 're fired if you do n't report and it 's found out , " said @entity132 , executive director of the @entity134 @entity133			0
but he also said it is " a stretch " to conclude that contract towers are safer			2
he said the two systems have " comparable levels of safety			0
" " the irony of the program is a lot of controllers are retired @entity12 controllers , " @entity132 said			0
@entity12 controllers must retire at age 56 , but contract controllers have no such mandatory retirement age			0
" so it 's a great opportunity for @entity12 controllers who do their 20 years and want to stay in the business , " he said			0
the " vast majority " of contract controllers are former @entity12 or former military controllers			0
they must be certified by the @entity12 and must meet the same medical requirements and are subject to the same drug testing			0
but contract towers are " definitely more cost - effective to the taxpayers , " @entity132 said			2
airports that have contract towers " are very positive of the program , " he said			0
" the reports are that it 's seamless			0
pilots will tell you they ca n't tell the difference between an @entity12 tower and the contract towers , and that 's our goal			1

contract towers have lower costs , same safety levels as @entity12 - staffed towers , study finds
controllers at contract towers must meet @entity12 safety , medical standards
contract towers began after @entity51 's 1981 firing of striking controllers
