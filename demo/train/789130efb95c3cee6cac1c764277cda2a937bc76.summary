@entity0 -- last week , @entity2 unveiled a list of wide - ranging reforms to the " gaokao " -- the hyper - competitive and grueling college entrance examination that represents most families ' best shot at the @entity2 dream			1
@entity2 media have hailed these reforms as a panacea to @entity2 's education woes : the poor will have a better shot at a top school , and students wo n't feel so stressed out all the time			1
however , as someone who 's either observed or worked in @entity2 education since 1999 , i believe that unless the government decides to cancel the gaokao , no systemic reform will matter			1
according to the @entity25 , @entity24 is no longer mandatory			0
students must take the @entity2 and math exams , but they can choose the other four subjects to be tested , and they can take these examinations separately ( much like the @entity31 system in the @entity32			1
) colleges can no longer recruit artists and athletes , a system that has been prone to abuse			0
finally , universities are encouraged to increase their quota of students from the poor inland provinces , and to make public their quotas			0
education liberalized to understand @entity2 's current education system , we have to go back to 1999			2
that 's when former premier @entity47 decided to liberalize the housing and education markets			0
government subsidies to @entity2 universities were cut , forcing universities to increase tuition and student enrollment			2
the effect of this change was dramatic : in 1991 , only 4 % of the cohort of @entity2 college - aged students attended universities ; today , according to ministry of education statistics , it 's about one quarter			1
to meet this demand for a college degree , vocational colleges were folded into universities , universities were merged to create super-universities , and super-universities built satellite campuses			1
this decision had severe consequences for how @entity2 parents perceive education , and how employers perceive university degrees : 1			2
) with a glut of university degree holders flooding the marketplace , employers began demanding university degrees for jobs that previously only required vocational training			1
this puts even more pressure on families to send their only child to college			0
) this means that a university degree is severely diluted , and middle - class families feel that it 's no longer enough to send their child to university -- he or she must get into a " key " or , best of all , a " top ten " university in @entity2			1
) this has led to an escalating arms race in which families put pressure on their child to succeed from day one			0
in @entity2 , there 's now a considered track for academic success : students get into the best elementary schools , which then secures them a place in the best junior high schools , which allows them to test into the best high school , s which gives them the best shot at testing into a top university			1
if students fall off this elevator to success at any point , they are considered " lost			0
" the gaokao system is essentially a lot of people trying to push each other away so that they can squeeze into the door of elite college admissions			2
it does n't really matter if you paint the door a different color or call the door a different name or let certain people jump the line -- it 's still a door with limited space , and you 'll still have tiger moms and dads who will fight tooth and nail to make sure their kid gets through the door			0
this system is what economists like to call a zero - sum game , and explains why children are so sleep - deprived and stressed - out , and why parents must flatter and bribe teachers			0
so , in essence , @entity2 's new gaokao reforms are just window dressing			1
what 's more , @entity2 's wealthy and well connected are opting for a new system outside the gaokao , enrolling their child in private bilingual schools and overseas high schools and colleges			1
those who can not pay their way are forced to continue in a system that promises the destruction of their child 's childhood , curiosity , and creativity			0
what should be done rather than try to dress up its system of narrowing doors , the @entity2 government should better serve the people and the nation by concentrating resources on building ladders			2
even if no one can say it aloud , the socialist dream of educational equality is dead and buried , and to move forward @entity2 needs to adopt a system of social mobility			2
that means a @entity184 - style early childhood education program in which poor rural children as young as eight months old are given access to daycare to address deficiencies in nutrition , literacy , and emotional stability that can plague them in their adult lives			0
that means a strong @entity196 - style system of vocational training to provide the rural poor real marketable skills so they no longer have to sweat and grunt in the fields and factories			1
and that means building a system of community colleges and continuing education programs to permit laborers to upgrade their skill sets and work towards a college degree			0
any of these three initiatives would be real and significant education reform in @entity2			0
and together , they 'd give those who most need it a good shot at the @entity2 dream			1
the opinions expressed here are solely those of @entity218 .			0
