-- with no wreckage or flight recorders from flight 370 to guide them , investigators in @entity2 are poring over information about the backgrounds of the pilots and passengers , radar data , and the transmissions from the cockpit			1
they also need to pay close attention to another important clue : the cargo manifest			1
the list of what ends up in the cargo hold of a passenger airplane goes beyond checked luggage			0
freight shippers use passenger carriers as well as cargo lines to deliver goods and raw materials			0
knowing what was in the cargo hold -- or at least what the official list says was in it -- is important in any accident investigation			2
it was never more important than it was in the case of the 1996 crash of @entity35			0
opinion : flight 's resting place is best clue the @entity41 plane , a @entity42 - 9 , crashed into the @entity43 shortly after takeoff from @entity45			2
investigators found the pilots were unable to control the plane after a fire raced through the cargo hold , disabling some of the plane 's systems			1
the source of the fire was traced to a shipment of oxygen canisters that had been mistakenly labeled and improperly packed			0
the accident led to a push by the @entity58 to put smoke detectors and fire - suppression systems in the cargo bays of all passenger aircraft			0
the @entity63 responded and today , halon fire - suppression systems tucked into the cargo holds are an important safety feature on passenger planes			2
so far , so good			0
since then , a new type of cargo has emerged : lithium batteries			1
there are two types of lithium batteries			2
one is the rechargeable batteries like those in your phone and laptop , also called lithium ion batteries			1
a second type , nonrechargeable batteries , also called lithium metal batteries , are used in everything from toys to medical devices			2
lithium metal batteries deliver extremely high densities of energy , and if they are mishandled they can catch fire , a fire that ca n't be extinguished with halon , the most common kind of fire - suppression systems in passenger aircraft			0
that 's one reason the @entity63 banned shipments of nonrechargeable lithium metal batteries on passenger planes in 2004			1
but that ban only applies in the @entity99 ; international authorities are still considering whether to enact such a rule			0
cargo and passenger aircraft are free to carry lithium ion batteries , although they are subject to labeling and packing regulations			1
so what was on board @entity108 ? @entity2 officials , after saying the cargo manifest would " be released in due course , " later got a little more specific and said the @entity113 was carrying 440 pounds of lithium ion batteries			1
what else ? nothing that would cause a problem , the @entity2 assure us			0
an @entity120 news media report said the @entity2 government refused to release the manifest to the @entity120 government , which would find such information helpful as it tries to map out a search			2
let 's assume little more than luggage and lithium ion batteries were in the plane 's cargo hold			1
although lithium ion fires are easier to suppress than lithium metal battery fires , both are susceptible to what 's called " thermal runaway " when ignited			1
that 's when one cell ignites the next cell , creating a fire that 's more difficult to control with traditional fire suppression methods			0
it 's worth noting that lithium ion batteries were the main suspect in the crash of a @entity146 @entity145 in @entity147 in 2010 , killing both pilots as they tried to make an emergency landing			1
investigators in the @entity151 studied the cargo records and found that shipments of lithium ion batteries that should have been declared hazardous cargo were not			1
the reinforced cargo liner was no match for the fire that quickly destroyed the aircraft 's control systems and filled the cockpit with smoke , incapacitating the pilots			0
presumably , the @entity2 government is paying close attention to anything on board the aircraft that might have caused a catastrophic fire			0
they need to be looking beyond the list of transported items , talking to freight shippers who might have had anything on board that was mislabeled , damaged or not handled correctly in transit			0
that 's just as important as talking to the relatives of the pilots and investigating the flight simulator one had in his home -- which , by the way , is not a crime and in the case of a pilot , often only shows a passion for the job			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity191 : investigators need to look closely at flight 370 's cargo manifest
@entity197 : @entity2 officials said *jet* was carrying 440 pounds of lithium ion batteries
@entity197 : lithium ion batteries are *flammable* , can burn in a way that 's difficult to extinguish
checking this is at least as important as investigating pilot 's flight simulator , she says
