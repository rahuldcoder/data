-- in the wake of the six - month anniversary of @entity6 's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls two weeks ago , the @entity2 military released a terse statement that it had negotiated a ceasefire with the cult - like @entity11 insurgency , saying it would be finalizing the details for return of most of the girls this week			1
the announcement came as a surprise , since the administration of president @entity19 had refused to negotiate for the girls ' release up to that point			2
what is going on ? @entity6 has yet to comment publicly on any of this , and instead attacked two villages the day after the purported ceasefire			1
last week , they reportedly abducted another 30 children			0
the @entity2 military has , for its part , regularly made false or misleading statements throughout the insurgency , which spread in earnest beginning in 2011 , and which has seen @entity6 expand control of territory in the northeast of the country			1
yet despite these developments , the @entity2 government maintains that talks with the insurgents are progressing in neighboring @entity41			1
if the government really is in talks , then it represents the best prospect for the return of the girls since they were kidnapped in april			0
still , a real resolution of the insurgency -- and an end to @entity6 's current tactics -- seems remote			1
after all , kidnapping is one of the most important sources of @entity6 financing , and the girls ' return will certainly come at a heavy price			2
moreover , the movement 's goal of installing its medieval version of a @entity61 - style state in as much of @entity2 as it can capture leaves little room for negotiating some form of a permanent settlement			1
but that is all looking ahead			0
in the meantime , there is the complicated issue of determining the @entity2 government 's motivations for agreeing to a ceasefire and negotiations			1
up to this point , the inaction and / or ineptitude of president @entity19 's administration in managing both @entity6 and the liberation of the kidnapped girls has prompted heavy criticism within @entity2 and abroad			1
the success of the # @entity83 movement , which has kept a daily demonstration alive in @entity85 since april , and enjoys the support of @entity88 first lady @entity87 and a chorus of celebrities , underscores public frustration with the @entity2 government 's poor management of @entity6			1
why the government , which earns roughly $ 100 billion annually from oil revenues alone , can not finish the job is the source of intense debate across @entity2			2
massive sums of public funds are being released for the counterinsurgency effort , but troops in the theater of operations have mutinied several times over lack of equipment and allegations that officers are stealing their pay			0
just as shocking as the corruption is the apparent indifference of the government to the emergency			0
the very day that @entity6 kidnapped the schoolgirls in april , just a day after it set off a bomb at a bus stop killing over 70 innocent victims , president @entity19 reportedly danced and sang at a political rally for himself and his ruling party as general elections approach in february 2015			1
not only did the military have a four - hour warning that the attack on the girls ' village was imminent , according to @entity128 , but it took them two weeks to respond			0
to his credit , president @entity19 met with his security chiefs about the kidnappings the day after the political rally , and also visited the bus stop shortly after the bombings took place			0
but his political priorities appear clear -- spending the majority of his energies seeking to stave off the growing political opposition to his re-election plans			0
despite a major insurgency that is threatening a third of the nation and displacing over 250,000 people , by some estimates , the business of politics , it seems , comes first			0
and what a business it is			0
earlier this year , the internationally respected governor of the central bank announced that $ 20 billion of @entity2 's oil earnings were unaccounted for by the state - owned oil company , and that he planned to investigate			1
rather than applauding these anti-corruption efforts , the president sacked the governor			0
in a surreal public debate , the finance minister counter-argued that " only " $ 10.8 billion was missing			0
while 85 % of @entity2 live on less than $ 2 per day , the @entity2 media report almost daily accusations of audacious spending and corruption across government at all levels , from gold - plated iphones allegedly distributed to guests at the president 's daughter 's wedding , to the minister of petroleum reportedly spending millions in public funds on chartered aircraft for private trips			1
as a result of all this , fears are growing that government claims of the girls ' imminent release is a public relations stunt designed for election year consumption and to divert attention from the @entity19 administration 's problems			1
not only has @entity6 embarked upon new attacks and kidnappings in recent days , but @entity2 journalists are also reporting that the man the government says is representing @entity6 at the talks in @entity41 is a fraud			1
the media - savvy head of @entity6 , @entity194 , has yet to comment , but the government has wrongly claimed to kill him twice already , only to have him appear in another online video			2
of course , if the negotiations prove to be real and succeed in reuniting the girls with their families , the @entity19 administration has a brief opportunity to initiate a process that could end the insurgency			0
@entity6 is a movement of many parts , the most extreme controlled by the @entity205			2
but other factions are interested in a negotiated settlement and have requested mediators on several occasions			0
if the @entity2 government can engage these fence - sitters in the movement in a peace process that offers some measure of amnesty , it may be able to isolate @entity194 and the hardliners sufficiently to bring them to justice and end the war			2
unfortunately , with so much at stake in the coming elections , there seems a very real chance that the @entity19 administration will return its attention to the business of politics , and lose this opportunity to change course			0
if so , it will face not only the weary @entity2 electorate at the ballot box in the coming months , but also a growing insurgency that may see less and less reason to negotiate .			2

despite ceasefire claims , @entity6 attacks *continue* , says @entity236
@entity2 president 's priority is next year 's election , @entity236 says
@entity242 : @entity2 journalists *skeptical* over @entity6 " talks "
