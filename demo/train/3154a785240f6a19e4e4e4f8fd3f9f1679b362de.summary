-- did @entity2 intelligence services miss vital clues as @entity4 showed signs of growing radicalization ? in the words of the @entity2 newspaper , @entity10 , on thursday : " did the security services fail in their surveillance ? " how do western intelligence agencies choose who to focus on as terror suspects , amid hundreds that express or harbor militant views ? do they have sufficient resources ; and where lies the balance between surveillance and the protection of civil liberties ? these are just a few of the questions emerging after @entity4 's killings			1
@entity4 had been on the radar of the @entity2 intelligence service for several years			1
he 'd been detained in @entity28 in 2010 and repatriated to @entity2 -- only to return to the @entity28 - @entity30 border area in august of last year			1
he 'd been interviewed by the @entity2 security services last november after returning from the @entity33 area a second time			1
but he had apparently persuaded them , even showing photographs he had taken , that he had been on a tourist trip			2
in addition , it has emerged that @entity4 was on a @entity41 no - fly - list , according to @entity41 officials , which would have prevented him from boarding any @entity41 - bound flight			1
there were also worrisome signs before he left for @entity28			1
two years ago , @entity4 " held " a 15 - year - old boy in his apartment and forced him to watch videos of @entity51 beheadings			1
when confronted by his mother , he assaulted her -- and she made a report to police			2
@entity2 media report that after the incident @entity4 donned military fatigues and yelled " i 'm @entity51 " in the street near the woman 's house			1
by then , he already had multiple convictions for minor offenses , and several jail sentences			0
both he and his older brother @entity64 were known to the security services because of their membership of a small @entity68 group in @entity69			0
@entity2 prosecutors say @entity64 was implicated in a network sending @entity73 militants to @entity74 in 2007 but not charged because of inadequate evidence			1
he is currently under arrest but has not been charged			0
but at the same time @entity4 did not fit any " conventional " profile of a jihadist - to - be			1
he was a motor - bike enthusiast and soccer player			2
according to his attorney , @entity81 , he was usually quiet and courteous -- " not rigid to the point of falling into fanaticism			0
" but @entity81 said there were signs of a " dual personality " in @entity87			0
friends have told @entity2 reporters of their shock at his sudden metamorphosis to killer			1
@entity2 interior minister @entity93 defended the work of @entity2 's equivalent of the @entity96 , the @entity99 du @entity98 Â© rieur			1
the @entity104 " follows a lot of people who are involved in @entity103 radicalism , " he said thursday			0
" expressing ideas , showing @entity68 opinions is not enough to bring someone before justice , " he said			0
nor had there been any " criminal tendencies " among @entity103 radicals in @entity69 , which has a large population of @entity114 origin , he said			0
@entity2 foreign minister @entity115 told a radio network thursday that " light must be shed " on events leading up to the shootings by @entity4			1
" i understand that one can ask whether there was a failing or not			0
as i do n't know if there was a failing , i ca n't tell you what kind of failing , but light must be shed on that , " @entity115 said on @entity122 1			0
one avenue of inquiry may be communication between different security agencies in @entity2			1
for example the @entity104 tracks @entity2 citizens who have returned from overseas travels ; the role of the external spy service @entity138 includes keeping tabs on foreigners in @entity2 suspected of links to extremism			1
other questions include the judicial authority needed for some forms of surveillance , although police in @entity2 can tap telephones with the approval of the prime minister and an administrative panel			1
there is also the issue of budget cuts at the @entity104 over the past few years			0
whether and how the @entity104 dropped the ball in @entity4 's case has already entered the bloodstream of the presidential race in @entity2 , with the candidate of the far - right @entity160 , @entity161 , demanding an inquiry into whether the intelligence services took necessary precautions in @entity4 's case and complaining of the government 's laxity in the face of the " fundamentalist risk			1
" another candidate , @entity170 , expressed surprise that @entity4 had been able to buy weapons without drawing attention , after so many convictions			1
in past cases efforts by terror suspects to make bombs , or gather the materials to do so , have triggered alerts			0
for example , attempts to buy large amounts of fertilizer or other ingredients -- such as hydrogen peroxide -- used in bomb - making are often relayed to law enforcement agencies			2
an attempt by @entity188 to contact a handler in the @entity28 - @entity30 border area as he tried make the high explosive petn in a @entity193 motel room was intercepted by counter-terrorism officers			1
@entity188 planned suicide bomb attacks on the @entity196 ; he is now serving a life sentence in federal prison			0
by contrast , planning a gun attack -- such as those in @entity69 or at @entity201 -- is less likely to trigger alarms			0
guns are easier to acquire ( though less so in @entity122 than in the @entity41 ) and easier to use than home - made bombs			1
that 's perhaps why @entity51 propagandists like @entity41 - born @entity209 have urged followers in the @entity41 to buy weapons at gun shows			1
" @entity41 is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms			1
you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle , " @entity209 said in a video posted last year			2
across @entity122 and in the @entity41 , radicalization within rapidly growing @entity114 and @entity221 populations has stretched domestic intelligence services , especially given substantial traffic between western countries and places like @entity30 , @entity226 and @entity227			1
some previous terror cases - in @entity229 , the @entity230 and @entity231 -- have shown second - generation immigrants to be less assimilated than their parents , and more conflicted about their surroundings			2
certainly that was the case among the bombers who carried out the july 2005 subway attacks in @entity230 , and among young some 20 @entity227 - @entity41 who suddenly left to wage jihad with @entity239 in 2008			1
those who are " self - radicalized , " who remain beyond any cell structure , who drift from one job or place of residence to another ( as @entity4 did ) are the most difficult to track			1
and counter-terrorism experts say a myriad of factors , many of them unpredictable , may be involved in pushing an individual from expressing militant views into committing bloody acts			0
even apparently obvious signs have been missed in previous terror cases			0
when @entity230 intelligence broke up a plot in 2004 to use fertilizer in a series of attacks , it discounted the plotters ' links to two men - @entity263 and @entity264			2
the pair went on to commit suicide bombing attacks on the @entity268 subway in july 2005			0
the @entity230 domestic intelligence agency @entity269 said in a statement later that @entity263 and @entity264 " appeared as petty fraudsters in loose contact with members of the plot			0
there was no indication that they were involved in the planning of any kind of terrorist attack in the @entity230			0
" similarly , new research into the planning of the 2004 @entity284 train bombings , published in the latest edition of the @entity286 by the @entity286 at @entity287 , shows extensive contacts between the plotters and @entity51 's leadership			2
for two years , according to author @entity291 , a key intermediary who had been part of an @entity51 cell in @entity295 since the mid- 1990s planned the attacks , returning to @entity295 from @entity30 months before the bombings			2
@entity291 , who became a senior adviser on counter-terrorism in the @entity295 government after the attacks , writes that when the @entity284 cell was dismantled in 2001 , there was insufficient evidence to prosecute at least three men			0
all became ringleaders in the bombings that killed 191 people on march 11 2004			0
@entity231 's problems in tracking right - wing extremists are also instructive			2
after several immigrants were murdered by neo-nazis between 2000 and 2007 , investigations established a lack of co-ordination between different state and federal agencies			0
the government responded with a plan to establish a central database of right - wing extremists available to the police and state authorities			2
but legal experts have questioned the criteria for including suspects and the blurring of lines between intelligence services and the police			0
some critics also say such databases can include so many names that they become redundant			0
by any standard , the record of the @entity2 intelligence services has been impressive to date , aided by some of @entity122 's toughest anti-terrorism laws			2
more than 200 people in @entity2 have been convicted of terrorism - related offenses since 2001			1
a @entity2 counter-terrorism source told @entity0 in 2010 that the security services had established a large network of informants within @entity2 's @entity346 communities - but cautioned that it had proved much more difficult to recruit informers among the younger generation of @entity2 muslims			1
on thursday , president @entity351 announced plans for legislation that would make it an offense for anybody to view jihadist websites regularly in @entity2 or travel abroad for jihadist training			2
there has been no terror attack on mainland @entity2 since 1995 , when a series of bombings was claimed by a group calling itself the @entity365 general command			2
one of the devices exploded at a @entity69 police station			0
the man behind the attacks , @entity368 , was also of @entity371 origin and had grown up in a poor district of @entity373			0
but the 17 years of peace since is unlikely to spare the @entity104 from some penetrating questioning after the events of the last week			0
@entity0 terrorism analyst @entity377 contributed to this story			0

@entity4 was on a @entity41 no - fly - list , according to @entity41 officials
he 'd been detained in @entity28 in 2010 and repatriated to @entity2
