-- a 35 - year - old father found to be sane when he killed his three young daughters last july was sentenced to three life sentences without the possibility of parole monday			1
@entity7 judge @entity6 said the lives of sisters @entity10 , 11 , @entity11 , 8 , and @entity12 , 5 , were each so important that @entity13 had to serve each sentence consecutively			1
" each child has to be recognized as an individual girl , " @entity6 said			0
" to make it concurrent would diminish what happened to those young girls			0
" @entity13 and his wife @entity20 had recently divorced when he came to spend the day with his daughters last year			1
according to the criminal complaint , @entity20 -- who was not home at the time -- told police that two hours after @entity13 went to see the girls , he called her and said , " you can come home now because i killed the kids			1
" @entity20 , who was in court monday , was quiet throughout the proceedings			0
but her sister , @entity32 , called @entity13 an " evil coward " who " should rot in hell " during the victim impact statements			1
" @entity13 , the man who helped genetically make those girls and shape them ... @entity13 became the darkness , the boogeyman , and the monster under the bed , " @entity32 said			2
" he was so evil that he took their unconditional love for him and used their love to lure them close enough so he could kill them			0
their last memory is what an evil killer their dad was			0
" @entity32 also expressed fear that if @entity13 was allowed to be released on parole , he would get revenge on her family			2
@entity13 sat through the proceedings with no visible emotion , avoiding eye contact and almost inaudibly saying " no " when the judge asked him if he had anything to say			1
his attorney , @entity64 , emphasized that his client suffered from a " rare mental illness " who committed a " rare catathymic homicide			1
" " nobody wins in this case , " @entity64 said			0
" both families suffer , @entity20 suffers , uncles , aunts			2
" you can say , ' three young girls are dead , we 've lost their lives , he did it because he hated @entity20 , let 's get our revenge			2
' or you can try to actually take a look at mental illness and prevent things in the future , " @entity64 said			1
a large photograph of the sisters stood by the judge , who finished his sentencing by saying , " people in general , there is sometimes an evil , and there is goodness , " @entity6 said			0
the girls ' aunt remembered them as " amazing people			0
