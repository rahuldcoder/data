-- evidence is mounting against camels as leading suspects in a deadly mystery that 's claimed more than 100 lives in the @entity6			2
the biological supervillain is the virus causing @entity9 , short for @entity10 , a type of coronavirus			1
since the first documented cases in spring 2012 , @entity10 has sickened at least 339 people in @entity15 alone and killed nearly a third of them , according to the country 's @entity17			1
a recent surge in reported cases -- including 26 new ones this past weekend -- has fanned concern the outbreak might be shifting into a more dangerous phase			1
with any newly recognized virus , disease detectives start with a few key questions			2
what kind of illness does it cause ? how is it spread ? and where does it come from ? with regard to that last question , a new paper leaves little doubt that at least one answer is camels			2
researchers from @entity43 , @entity39 and the @entity41 - based @entity40 managed to isolate live @entity10 virus from two single - humped camels , known as dromedaries			1
should i be concerned about new virus ? a genetic analysis found numerous substrains in the camel viruses , including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient			1
the findings are published in @entity57 , the open - access journal of the @entity59			2
the attention on camels is n't new ; in february , the same group published a finding that nearly three - quarters of camels in @entity15 tested positive for past exposure to the @entity10 coronavirus			1
the new paper still leaves many questions unanswered : for example , what other animals might harbor the virus ? could it be bats , as some have suggested ? " there might be another animal , but we do n't know , " says dr. @entity75 , who organized the research as director of the @entity78 at @entity43 's @entity79			0
" we need more in terms of surveillance			0
" does the virus make camels sick ? researchers do n't know , says @entity88 , another study author and president of the @entity40 , which researches links between animal health and human disease			1
perhaps most urgent : has something recently changed to make @entity9 more dangerous ? here , some of the evidence is reassuring			0
any avid mystery reader knows that a watchdog who does n't bark can be an important clue			0
with @entity10 , there is a lack of alarm bells from the laboratory ; so far there is no evidence that the virus is changing to attack people more aggressively or to spread more easily			1
there is n't enough evidence to draw a firm conclusion , says dr. @entity111 , a leading expert on coronaviruses and a professor of pediatrics at @entity115			0
it also remains to be seen whether humans are being infected by more than one of the substrains found in camels			1
" there 's a lot more work that would need to be done " to prove it , he says			0
those who study @entity9 says it 's crucial to pin down just how the virus is transmitted			0
" we need to know what people are most at risk , " @entity88 says			0
" we do n't know if they 're involved in camel racing , camel breeding , camel slaughter -- that 's really critical right now			0
" @entity75 says the virus likely spreads in a variety of ways , but he 'd like to see more aggressive steps taken to prevent the possibility of people being infected by eating camel meat or drinking raw , unpasteurized camel milk -- both of which are common in @entity15			1
he says the @entity15 will face special concerns again this fall when millions descend on the holy cities of @entity149 and @entity150 for the @entity152 pilgrimage			2
as part of the ritual , animals are sacrificed , and their meat shipped all over the world to help feed the hungry			0
@entity15 : more deaths from respiratory syndrome " the butchery will begin in three or four months ' time , and we have to have measures in place to ensure that the animals are n't infected , " @entity75 says			2
for example , he says , officials could decide to forbid the slaughter of young camels for food since younger animals are more likely to carry the @entity10 virus			1
dr. @entity172 , who heads the team responsible for tracking @entity10 at the @entity174 , says the @entity15 government took steps to discourage the spread of the virus during last year 's @entity152 , including posting warnings to discourage people older than 65 , pregnant women or those who were immune - compromised from making the pilgrimage			1
health authorities have not yet decided what steps to take this year , @entity172 says , but the @entity185 is watching the situation closely			0
" any time you have an emerging infection that has a high case fatality rate , that 's been around for over a year , that has caused illness in multiple countries , that 's caused illness in travelers and health care workers , and for which there is no treatment or vaccine , we 're concerned			0
we 've been concerned for a year and a half , and we remain concerned			0

the @entity10 coronavirus has sickened more than *330* people in @entity15
twenty - six new cases were reported last weekend
researchers have found the live virus in camels
