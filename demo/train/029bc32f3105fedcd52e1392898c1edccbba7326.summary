@entity1 's prime minister threatened saturday night to bomb a @entity3 - flagged ship that had entered a rebel - held oil port , calling the ship 's arrival there a " violation of international law			1
" prime minister @entity11 said if the ship does not follow orders , " it will be bombed and this could lead to an environmental disaster			1
" the vessel , dubbed @entity17 , docked late friday night in the oil port of as - @entity19			1
@entity11 said the ship 's captain subsequently was warned by phone , though the captain responded that local militia on board did not allow them to depart			1
@entity1 government officials spoke with diplomats at @entity3 's embassy in @entity29 , @entity11 said			1
he added that information showed a " @entity33 nation " owned the ship and that it is registered in @entity3			2
a spokesman for @entity1 's @entity35 indicated the tanker was @entity37 owned , but @entity37 's embassy released a statement saying it had nothing to do with the ship			1
in addition , an arrest warrant has been issued for the oil tanker 's captain and " the use of armed force , as necessary , " has been authorized , according to @entity11			1
the situation speaks to the unsettled situation in the @entity50 nation , which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime @entity1 leader @entity53			0
in this case , the issue centers around the oil - rich eastern part of the country and one man in particular , @entity59			0
the militia leader was entrusted by the government to safeguard crucial oil ports			0
but last july , @entity59 and his men seized them , blocking oil exports , and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region			0
meet the man holding @entity1 's oil hostage " we used to be part of that government until the corruption became so visible , and the government started to sell oil without measuring units , and after we became certain that such a government is not credible and unable to rebuild the state , " the 32 - year - old @entity59 told @entity71 's @entity70 in january			2
" that 's why we declared independence of our province and we started to seek our fair rights			0
" there is a lot at stake , given the @entity1 government 's precarious state and the wealth of natural resources in the country			2
@entity1 is thought to have @entity93 's largest proven oil reserves			2
the country produced 1.6 million barrels per day after the revolution only to have that output slow to a relative trickle of fewer than 200,000 barrels per day by the end of last year			0
the government has said the disrupted oil production , from seizures of ports as well as protests and strikes at other oil facilities , is costing the country $ 130 million a day			0
saturday night 's threat against the @entity3 - flagged vessel is n't the first time @entity1 's government has threatened force against ships that enter the eastern oil ports			1
on several occasions , authorities have issued ultimatums to such ships , only to have those deadlines come and go with no action .			0
