-- when it comes to actress @entity3 's sexuality , perhaps the best way to describe it is " whatever			1
" as the 46 - year - old actress reveals in a first - person column for the @entity9 , she 's been romantically involved with her female best friend -- but considers the father of her 12 - year - old son , @entity12 , her partner as well			1
the " prisoners " star , who 's spent the past 20 - plus years appearing in a variety of films and tv shows , from " er " to " @entity19 , " says in the column that maybe the true " modern family is just a more honest family , " and that her truth is that she 's fallen in love with her friend , @entity24			1
" my feelings about attachment and partnership have always been that they are fluid and evolving , " @entity25 writes in the @entity9			1
" @entity12 's father , @entity29 , will always be my partner because we share @entity12			2
@entity29 is the best father and the most wonderful man i 've known			0
just because our relationship is nonsexual does n't make him any less of a partner			0
... and @entity24 will always be my partner because she is also my best friend			0
" and yet , a few years ago , @entity25 realized that her feelings for @entity24 moved beyond friendship			1
those feelings also " are n't the same as the butterflies - in - the - stomach , angst - ridden love i have felt before , " @entity25 writes			1
" they are much deeper than that			0
" but as she came to this realization and embarked on a " long , painful , wonderful process of trying to figure out what our relationship was supposed to be , " there were two questions that immediately came to mind			0
" first , how would it affect my son ? he trusted @entity24			0
he had never met most of the men i had been in love with and had no idea i had been with a woman as well , " @entity25 says			2
" second , how would it affect my career ? i have never defined myself by whom i slept with , but i know others have and would			0
" indeed , @entity25 admits that she was somewhat scared about how her revelation would be perceived , especially by her adolescent son			2
but , as she recounts in the column , her fears were unfounded			0
after she opened up to @entity12 that she was in a romantic relationship with @entity24 , a woman who 's like a godmother to him , he responded , " @entity72 , love is love , whatever you are			2
" @entity25 has taken her son 's words to heart , and concluded that she " would like to consider myself a ' whatever , ' as @entity77 said			1
whomever i love , however i love them , whether they sleep in my bed or not , or whether i do homework with them or share a child with them , ' love is love			0
' and i love our modern family			1
