@entity0 -- after hinting for months that he would start a " trusted traveler " program to expedite screening at airport checkpoints , @entity3 chief @entity2 took his first step in that direction thursday , announcing a pilot project for passengers who voluntarily release certain information about themselves			1
the pilot project initially will be small , limited to a select group of travelers and to people already enrolled in existing programs run by border officials			1
nonetheless , the travel industry and some politicians hailed it as a major change of philosophy that eventually could have a major impact on airport screening , diverting security from known individuals and focusing attention on unknown travelers and suspected terrorists			1
the @entity3 disclosed few details about the inner workings of the program			1
but industry officials briefed by the @entity3 said eligible participants will get to forgo some of the banalities of checkpoint searches -- such as removing shoes and jackets , and taking computers from carry - on bags			1
participants also likely will be directed through magnetometers instead of through full - body imagers , which take more time and have raised privacy concerns , they said			2
the pilot project will begin this fall			1
" these improvements will enable our officers to focus their efforts on higher risk areas , " @entity2 said			0
he called it a " common sense step " that will strengthen overall security			0
" i think they 're definitely headed in the right direction , " said @entity57 , former assistant secretary of the @entity58 , and partner in the @entity60			0
" i think the time is right			0
with travel loads increasing and with budgetary pressures , they need to find a way to do more with less			0
" " this is a signal from @entity71 that he 's not going to sit idly by and let the system be , " said @entity68 , executive vice president of @entity69			0
" we hope this is a first step to wholesale reform , and kudos to him for having the courage to do that			0
the pilot test initially will be available only to certain frequent fliers on @entity83 and @entity84 airlines -- flying out of certain airports			2
@entity84 passengers must be flying out of @entity88 and @entity89 airports , and @entity91 passengers must be flying out of @entity93 and @entity94 airports			0
it is also open to participants in @entity97 and @entity99 's trusted traveler programs , including @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102			0
all participants must be @entity83 citizens			0
the @entity3 said it plans to expand this pilot program to include @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity111 airlines , and additional airports , once operationally ready			1
currently , the @entity3 vets passenger lists against " watch lists " of known or suspected terrorists			1
but the @entity3 is working with a very limited amount of information about those passengers -- namely a person 's full name , date of birth and gender			1
under " trusted traveler " programs , travelers voluntarily surrender more information about themselves , giving the government more assurances of who they are			1
the amount and nature of the information that will be sought was not disclosed			2
in recent years , there has been a drumbeat of calls for the @entity3 to adopt a trusted traveler program			1
@entity137 and critics have stepped up that demand following two highly publicized incidents , one involving the search of a 6 - year - old girl , and the other involving a 95 - year - old cancer patient			0
in both cases , the @entity3 has said the airport screeners were following established protocols			1
but the @entity3 also has said it is working toward a " risk - based " trusted traveler program that could expedite travel for people believed to present little risk to aviation			1
the @entity3 said @entity71 will work with @entity154 commissioner @entity153 and the airlines to determine passenger eligibility for this screening project , which is voluntary			1
all passengers in the pilot project will be subject to recurrent security checks			2
@entity57 said that for the project to be successful , participants will want " predictable " wait times , and assurances that they will go through different screening			2
travelers also will want their reviews based on their individual characteristics , and not solely their relationship with their airline , since many travelers use multiple carriers , @entity57 said			2
@entity57 and @entity68 both said it is crucial that special lanes be devoted to the trusted travels to expedite their passage			0
security experts have long expressed concern about so - called " clean skins " -- potential terrorists who enroll in " trusted traveler " programs to avoid scrutiny during a terror mission			0
but the @entity3 says it will continue to incorporate random and unpredictable security measures to address such concerns			2
@entity2 said other layers of security will remain in place , including intelligence gathering and analysis , explosive - detection canine teams , federal air marshals , closed - circuit television monitoring and behavior detection officers .			0
