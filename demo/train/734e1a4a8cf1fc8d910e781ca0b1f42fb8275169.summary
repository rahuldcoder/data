-- one of the heroes of the @entity2 against @entity4 occupation , @entity5 , has died in @entity6 at the age of 97			1
with his passing , @entity8 has lost one of its few remaining links to an era that brought both humiliation and inspiration			2
@entity17 president @entity16 paid tribute to aubrac wednesday			2
" these heroes of the shadows who saved @entity8 's honor at a time when it seemed lost are disappearing one after the other , " he said			2
foreign minister @entity28 also spoke admiringly of @entity19			2
" his commitment , his courage , his refusal to give up , his attachment to the pride of @entity8 , " @entity28 said , " made him a hero of the resistance -- notably alongside his wife , @entity37			1
" @entity5 was a jew of @entity39 origin whose real name was @entity5			1
born in 1914 , he studied at @entity41 before joining the @entity17 army			2
the @entity43 took him prisoner in 1940 but he escaped and with @entity37 applied for visas to live in the @entity46			1
but they reconsidered the decision			2
" we changed our minds : could we really leave our families and our friends behind while our country was occupied ? " she later wrote			2
@entity54 , an expert on wartime @entity8 and professor at the @entity56 in @entity57 , says @entity5 and his wife were important in the resistance as founding members of a group called @entity62 , based in @entity63			1
@entity54 met the @entity64 and wrote " fleeing @entity65 : @entity8 1940			2
" she said that many like - minded people fled to the unoccupied part of @entity8 and used the relative freedom they had there to organize			1
among them was @entity72 , a charismatic leader credited with bringing together different groups of the resistance			2
in june 1943 @entity72 and @entity5 were captured , along with other resistance leaders , by the @entity76 , led at the time by the infamous @entity78			1
@entity78 interrogated @entity72 , and he was tortured to death			0
in a @entity81 interview earlier this year , @entity5 recalled that fateful day			1
" i was sitting beside @entity72 and when the @entity76 burst in , he told me : ' i have a piece of paper in my pocket			0
' " so i put my hand in his pocket and took out the paper and swallowed it - which is not easy			1
i have no idea what was written on it			0
" after the war , i came back to the house in @entity95 -- and there on the mantelpiece in the waiting room was my pipe			0
exactly where i had left it when the @entity76 came ! " months after the arrests , @entity37 -- though pregnant at the time -- organized one of the most dramatic rescues of the resistance			1
she persuaded the @entity43 that she was pregnant by @entity5 but not married to him ( which was untrue )			1
the ruse worked and he was taken to the police headquarters in @entity63 for a marriage ceremony			0
on the way back to the jail , resistance fighters ambushed the detainees ' truck			0
@entity5 and 13 other prisoners fled			1
@entity78 was put on trial in @entity63 in 1987			0
he was charged with crimes against humanity for organizing the mass deportation of @entity118 from @entity63 , as well as ordering massacres and carrying out torture			0
he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison and he died behind bars			1
@entity37 died five years ago			1
her fictionalized account of the couple 's wartime exploits , translated into @entity127 as " outwitting the @entity76 , " was turned into a film in 1997 , directed by @entity129			0
in the chaotic aftermath of the liberation in june 1944 , @entity5 became the commissioner of the new @entity133 in the port of @entity135			1
it was a time of nightmares , he recalled , with summary executions and retribution , a lack of government and no rule of law			0
for many years after the @entity143 talked to schools about the @entity2 and its goals			1
his message , he told the @entity17 newspaper @entity147 last month , was this : " one thing always guided us -- optimism , the conviction that through what we were doing we could bring change			0
that 's what i tell young people			0
if you begin feeling beaten , you will achieve nothing			0
if you fight you will perhaps have a chance of achieving something			0
" but just who did what in the @entity2 has frequently been a source of heated debate in @entity8 where there 's been much agonizing about collaboration with the @entity168 and ambivalence about the resistance			1
@entity54 says there was also something of a backlash in @entity8 about the @entity175 ' celebrity			0
and in their waning years the role of the @entity175 was questioned because their accounts contained inconsistencies			1
a book published in 1997 even implicated the couple in the arrest of @entity2 leaders at their meeting in june 1943			1
the book included allegations from @entity78 himself , who asserted that the @entity175 were the double agents who had informed him of the meeting			0
the couple later successfully sued the author			0
but @entity54 says the allegations deeply wounded them			0
another source of regret for @entity5 was his failure to persuade his parents to leave @entity8 for the safety of @entity198 even though he had secured false papers for them			1
" my mother wanted to leave , " he later recalled , " but my father paradoxically still had faith in @entity206 " -- then the ruler of @entity8 , the part unoccupied by @entity4 forces			1
his parents were later captured by the @entity207 ( @entity208 ) and handed over to the @entity76 , and then transported to the concentration camp at @entity210 where they died			2
to the very end , @entity5 preferred thinking of the present and the future rather than his storied past			1
in his interview with @entity147 last month he recalled studying at the @entity216 in 1937 under the great economist @entity217 who had taught that technological change transformed civilizations as well as economies			0
" there is now a generation of young people for whom there is nothing on offer , " he said			0
" they do n't feel that society needs them , that they should prepare to play a role			0
when they tell me they will be unemployed , whatever they do , i find that very troubling			0
" asked what he was most proud of , he replied his decision to be with @entity37			1
they were married for 68 years			2
" in life , you know , there are three or four fundamental choices			0
the rest is a matter of luck			0

@entity5 was a hero in the @entity2 against @entity4
the 97 - year - old and wife @entity37 , who died 5 years ago , were *instrumental* in the *historic* group
@entity5 was a jew of @entity39 descent ; he twice escaped @entity4 capture
