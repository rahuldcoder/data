-- i am sorry to report that @entity2 has shut down all government and civilian activities under a haze of pot smoke			1
citizens are rioting in a pot - induced trance			2
tourists are avoiding the @entity12 called @entity2			1
keep your children indoors and your money in the mattress ! yes , many skeptics predicted terrible consequences , but six months after legalization of recreational marijuana in @entity2 , the sky still has n't fallen			1
we understand that @entity2 and @entity23 are under intense scrutiny because of their forward - thinking legalization of marijuana			1
being first presents challenges and opportunities			2
but there is much to learn from @entity2 's experiment , lessons in what works and what does n't			1
' i like weed , and i 'm a good person ' success in these early stages already shows reduced underage use and tremendous tax revenues , according to statistics compiled by the @entity41 , amounting to millions of dollars a month			1
gov. @entity42 anticipates cannabusiness to be a billion - dollar industry in 2014 in @entity2			1
applications to attend @entity2 schools have increased -- to no one 's surprise			1
identifying the single biggest problem facing the state , counties , cities , and cannabusinesses in @entity2 is easy : it 's the banking situation			1
because pot remains illegal under federal law , legal financial institutions wo n't work with marijuana businesses , and they are forced to operate on a 100 % cash basis			1
no one wins when consumers must pay cash only ; and businesses must pay taxes , employees , rent , electric bills , and every other normal business expense in cash			2
quarterly withholding is paid only in cash , only by appointment , only in @entity74 , and only with a 10 % cash payment penalty added by the federal government			1
the federal government must provide more than lip service to this issue , and sooner is better			1
legal marijuana has benefits on many social fronts			2
drug laws have for too long put young people in prison , often ruining their lives ; this is especially true for people of color			0
renting an apartment can become a personal nightmare because of a marijuana conviction			0
a mortgage can become impossible			0
we know that marijuana is substantially safer than alcohol			0
no one seriously disputes this anymore			0
how safe is it ? the number of people killed by marijuana overdose every year remains at zero			0
a study reported an average of 317 @entity105 died each year from alcohol poisoning -- but the @entity107 reports that 88,000 deaths a year " can be attributed to excessive use of alcohol			0
" recent police sting operations , from january 2014 , resulted in zero violations of the ban on selling to minors			0
law and regulation means greater safety for consumers			0
large numbers of people consume pot in every state -- a @entity125 survey in april found that 47 % of @entity105 say they have tried marijuana			2
in @entity2 and @entity23 , they can expect some protection from adulterants , mold , and other impurities , while knowing the potency of their intended purchases			1
the states can expect substantial tax revenues , increased employment , and a reduction in jail overcrowding			1
private prisons will become less necessary			0
but the garden is not entirely roses			0
@entity2 has struggled with problems linked to marijuana edibles			1
people who have eaten or ingested too much of a marijuana - laced treat have become nauseous and extremely anxious ; half of the 79 calls to medical facilities concerning marijuana in the first four months of legalization regarded edibles			0
the state is pursuing labeling , packaging , and potency regulations as part of the solution			0
parents should protect children from marijuana as they would from alcohol or aspirin			0
consumers should expect consistent dosages and known ingredients			0
the state and the other stakeholders must continue to work toward solutions as areas of concern become apparent			2
another benefit : being able to grow hemp as a fiber , overlooked by the country in 1937 and easily forgotten , is a tremendous positive result of legalization			0
@entity178 helped win @entity179 and plays a significant role in a laundry list of applications			0
@entity2 , as a large farm state , stands to win			1
the inexcusable practice of buying processed hemp from other countries is eliminated			0
the industry has willingly complied with wall - to - wall video surveillance , labeling , child - proof packaging , dose control , and hundreds of pages of detailed laws and regulations			2
this is government - civilian cooperation at its best			2
the mutual desire to find intelligent solutions permits industry - government cooperation at levels simply impossible in the past			1
@entity2 is not finished -- and every success will be reported on @entity203			1
every problem will be " page one , above the fold			0
" as a world role model , @entity2 can lead the way on how to do this right			1
the @entity105 was properly referred to as the " @entity210 " : @entity2 is part of that			1
this is our democracy at work in a vibrant , organic way			2
peace has been declared in a particular corner of the war on drugs			0
mr. president , in @entity2 , we respect your right to say " no , thank you , " as you did when someone offered you a hit on your recent visit to @entity74			2
however , if you change your mind , our invitation to visit and to have a toke is still open .			0

@entity231 says pot is legal in two states and the sky has n't fallen
of @entity2 , he says : sales tax revenues will bring millions , and crime is down
lack of bank service causes problematic cash *economy* , he says
government , civilians and industry are cooperating for experiment to work
