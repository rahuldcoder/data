-- @entity2 's vital oil industry appears to be the latest front in a power struggle between president @entity5 and supreme leader @entity6 -- a fight that overseas analysts say the colorful president appears to be losing			1
@entity5 is trying to retain control of @entity2 's @entity11 despite a ruling by the country 's top judicial body that he ca n't serve as its acting chief			1
it 's the latest in a series of unusually public squabbles between @entity5 and allies of @entity6 , the @entity20 's clerical leader , in recent weeks			1
@entity6 backed @entity5 through the tumult that followed his hotly disputed 2009 re-election , urging @entity2 to accept the results of the balloting when protesters in the streets declared it a fraud			2
he presided over a crackdown on the demonstrations , during which security forces were unleashed on crowds and activists were prosecuted and jailed			0
but elements throughout the government have moved to check @entity5 's efforts to replace top officials and have gone after the president 's closest advisers , @entity35 analyst @entity34 told @entity0			1
" i think it 's a symptom of the general dissatisfaction with president @entity5 that his powers and movement are being curtailed by the various power centers in @entity2 , " said @entity34 , an expert on @entity2 politics at the @entity43 , an @entity35 think tank			1
the outspoken @entity5 has long been a lightning rod for @entity2 's critics			1
but @entity53 , director of @entity55 studies at the @entity56 , said he may be left a " lame duck " after butting heads with @entity6			1
" i think @entity5 underestimated the power of @entity6 , and he overestimated his own power , " said @entity53 , who was jailed for more than three months in 2007 during a visit to @entity2			2
" you can step on anybody 's toes , but not on his toe			0
" top officials and media outlets close to @entity6 have mounted a campaign of criticism targeting @entity5 since mid-april , when @entity5 tried to fire intelligence minister @entity70			2
when @entity6 vetoed the move , @entity5 retreated from the public eye , skipping cabinet meetings			2
@entity53 said @entity5 appears to have violated one of @entity6 's cardinal principles for @entity2 's leadership : settle your differences in private			1
" @entity6 all along has been trying to give the impression that the ruling class speaks with one voice , that there is unanimity among them , " she said			0
in early may , @entity5 publicly swore allegiance to @entity6 and stressed his dedication to the principle of @entity87 , or @entity88 of the @entity89 , which forms the bedrock of @entity2 's @entity92 theocratic rule			1
but on may 16 , @entity5 declared himself the caretaker head of the @entity11 as part of an attempt to consolidate @entity97 agencies			0
that would put him in direct control of the world 's third - largest oil reserves , the bedrock of the country 's economy			2
but the leaders of @entity2 's parliament protested , and the @entity107 -- @entity2 's top judicial body , dominated by @entity6 's allies -- ruled last week that @entity5 ca n't act as the caretaker minister			1
wednesday , the head of the parliament 's @entity112 blamed @entity5 for an explosion and fire at @entity2 's flagship oil refinery at @entity117 that injured six people			1
the blast occurred when @entity5 was visiting to attend the inauguration of a new unit at the facility , lawmaker @entity119 said in comments carried by the @entity126 news agency			0
" some of the refinery 's managers have said that it happened because they hurried the process of completion of the project , " @entity119 said			0
he said those hurt " were sacrificed because of certain disagreements and the unnecessary insistence to leave the @entity11 without a caretaker			0
" meanwhile , @entity2 news agencies reported that @entity5 's palace prayer leader , @entity137 , faces charges of " sorcery " after producing a controversial film predicting the imminent return of the @entity142 , a messianic prediction that @entity5 often refers to in his speeches			1
public criticism also has been focused on his brother - in - law and chief of staff , @entity146 , whom @entity5 appeared to have been grooming as a successor			0
some of @entity5 's moves appeared calculated to remain influential beyond the end of his term in 2013 , @entity34 said			2
but he said @entity5 made " a critical mistake " by firing @entity70 without consulting the supreme leader , and by skipping @entity97 sessions after @entity6 reinstated him			2
" it 's pretty incredible how much power and influence he 's lost in the last few weeks , " @entity34 said , adding , " i think it shows that he 's not as powerful and consequential as he and a lot of people would like to assume			1
" @entity34 and @entity53 said @entity5 is unlikely to be forced from office -- something @entity34 said would amount to an admission of a mistake by @entity6			0
" the best outcome for the president is to serve his term , keep relatively quiet , stop being provocative and making decisions on his own , " @entity34 said			0
and @entity53 said @entity6 , who has ruled @entity2 since 1989 , has made it clear to observers inside and outside @entity2 just who is in charge			0
" this is just the beginning , " she said			0
" this is a story that will be unfolding over the next six months or year or so			0
" @entity0 's @entity176 contributed to this report .			0
