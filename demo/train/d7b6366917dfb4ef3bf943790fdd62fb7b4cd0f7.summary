-- walking into school wednesday morning was not easy for @entity2			1
the last time she 'd been there was march 11 , the day after her @entity7 , @entity8 , high school canceled prom rather than allow her to wear a tuxedo and attend with her girlfriend			1
she did n't assume last week 's spring break would cool things down			2
she expected stares , dirty looks and cold shoulders , and passing through the doors was daunting			0
over these last two weeks , she said , she 's had a hard time sleeping , can barely eat , feels anxious and -- until she saw a doctor for help -- often felt like she was " going to throw up			2
" " i 've been very nervous about all of this , " the 18 - year - old @entity23 senior said			2
" i do n't like being somewhere where everyone hates me			0
" @entity28 's name made national headlines when she , with the help of the @entity31 , filed suit against her school and the @entity23 , asking them to reinstate prom for everyone , without discrimination			1
a federal judge in @entity8 ruled tuesday that while he would n't force the school to have a prom , which had originally been scheduled for april 2 , he agreed that @entity28 's first amendment rights had been violated			1
that was good news , said her attorney , @entity43 , senior counsel with the @entity31 's lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender project			1
it set a precedent and helped broadcast an important statement , which was made stronger by virtue of where it came from , she said			0
" we 're in a conservative area of the country , where people tend to think we can do what we like , " said @entity53 , who lives in @entity55 but has traveled multiple times to @entity8 for this legal push			1
" this case sends a strong message that that 's not going to fly anymore			2
" the only pending issue , @entity53 said , is the question of damages and the @entity31 's request for attorneys ' fees			1
an amended complaint to seek a quick resolution on this should be filed in the next 30 days , she said			0
meantime , @entity28 is trying to find her new normal			0
in many ways , she stands in an awkward balance			0
though there are some people who support her in @entity7 ( population about 4,000 ) , the overarching tension and what she described as " hostility " that she feels at school and in her community is in deep contrast to the reception and groundswell of support that 's overwhelmed her nationally			1
as a poster child for the rights of @entity93 students , she 's been asked to jump on airplanes to appear on news programs and talk shows			1
the @entity99 fan page " let @entity97 ! " had attracted more than 414,000 fans as of friday morning			1
wealthy individuals , including @entity102 , have offered to pay for a prom for her school			1
she 's received a $ 30,000 college scholarship from an anonymous donor and @entity109 , a digital media company in @entity55 that 's also offered her a summer internship			1
she 's even been invited to high school proms in cities she 's never visited			1
" it means a lot to me , " she said of the outreach from others			0
" the amount of support helps me to continue with the fight			2
" but all @entity28 , who came out as a lesbian in eighth grade , ever wanted was to go to her school prom with her class , and with her girlfriend			1
going to another school 's prom , while a nice offer , does n't make any sense to her			1
parents at her school are reportedly planning a " ball " for the same night that prom was intended			2
@entity28 said she 's still trying to find out if she 's free to attend with her girlfriend			2
she wo n't go otherwise			0
she never meant to be a spoiler for others when she sought approval to bring her girlfriend and wear a tuxedo , she said			2
she thought she was doing the right thing by asking in advance , since the school had stipulated in a february memo that dates must be of the opposite sex			0
rather than give her permission , the school canceled the prom			2
@entity28 said she 's learning who her " true friends " are			0
they 're the ones who respect her for taking a stance , defend her when others talk trash about her , do n't turn their backs when she approaches and are n't afraid to be seen with her			0
her girlfriend , too , has remained a constant support , even though she herself has n't gone public			2
@entity28 also said she 's blessed to have family members who shore her up even if they do n't all feel comfortable with her sexual orientation			0
" my grandmother does n't believe in it [ same - sex relationships ] but still stands behind me no matter what , " @entity28 said , her southern drawl thick			0
" she 's a conservative @entity165 but respects that it 's my life			0
she does n't think discrimination of any kind is right			0
" whether she intended to or not , @entity28 has inspired others -- not just nationally but in her home state , said @entity171 , 19 , a student at @entity172			1
" i thought for a long time i was the only gay person in the state of @entity8 , " said @entity171 , who came out at 15 and went to high school about 1Â½ hours from where @entity28 lives			1
@entity28 's actions speak for others who feel unable to speak for themselves , said @entity171 , who 's a founding board member of the @entity178 , which helped connect @entity28 with the @entity31			1
the grass - roots organization seeks to protect the interests of @entity93 youth and will host a " second chance prom " on may 8 , an event @entity180 estimated may attract as many as 500 students , thanks in large part to the way @entity28 's fight empowers others			1
hear stories of others helped by the @entity178 " usually @entity8 is 10 or 20 years behind , " @entity171 said			2
" for @entity8 to be spearheading the @entity93 student movement is unheard of			1
i , personally , and my co-workers are so proud to have it happen in our state , " where " queer flight , " the compulsion to leave as soon as one is able , is rampant , she said			0
as for where life will take @entity28 after graduation , she is n't yet sure			0
she 's still thinking about that summer internship offer in @entity55 and is pretty certain she 'll attend @entity204 for a couple years before going to one of her dream schools , the @entity207 or @entity208			0
what she does know is she 'd like to study and possibly pursue a career in psychology			0
" i like helping people , and i like talking to people about their problems , " she said			0
" i find the human mind and human behavior very interesting			0
" @entity218 of @entity0 's " @entity219 " unit will file an extended report on gay teens in the " @entity178 , " the group that was key in connecting @entity2 to her @entity31 legal team			1
the story is expected to air in late may or early june .			0
