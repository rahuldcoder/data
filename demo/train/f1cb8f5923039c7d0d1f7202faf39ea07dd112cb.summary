@entity0 -- @entity2 gunfire and clashes from a violent military crackdown on protesters in @entity0 's @entity7 on saturday left @entity8 feeling shocked , confused and angered in the hours that followed			1
long bursts of machine - gun fire erupted overnight starting around 3 a.m. , when scores of soldiers backed by armored personnel carriers launched a raid on the square			1
amateur video posted on @entity18 showed troops storming the square 's central roundabout amid rattling gunfire			2
hundreds of protesters -- calling for @entity8 's ruling military council to prosecute former president , @entity24 -- fled the scene as clouds of tear gas billowed through central @entity0			1
among them were at least four wounded and bleeding men			0
protesters tried to stop an ambulance from leaving the square			2
two badly beaten men in military uniform were lying in the back of the vehicle			2
it is not clear whether or not they were troops engaged in the crackdown -- or whether they were some of the 15 uniformed army officers and soldiers who defied direct orders by joining a protest of tens of thousands of demonstrators in @entity7 on friday			1
by morning , security forces withdrew from the square , leaving behind spent bullet casings and in one place , a pool of blood			0
@entity8 military confirmed that one person died from a gunshot wound overnight and that 42 people were detained , including three foreigners			1
" it was a disaster , " said protester @entity55			0
" the army attacked us in coordination with the police			0
" @entity55 said activists tried to help the dissenting military personnel to escape the crackdown by dressing four of them as civilians			2
gen. @entity66 , a member of the @entity67 , said security personnel did not attack the protesters			2
" because of the pushing and clashes between the armed forces -- who i assure you had no weapons whatsoever -- because of clashes and pushing and shoving and you can imagine how a big group of protesters and soldiers could get some bruises in the pushing and shoving			2
four from the armed forces ( who joined the protesters ) have some bruises plus nine civilian protesters , " he said			0
tensions mounted between demonstrators and the military hours before the raid			1
late friday , activists were seen confronting two military officers who tried to approach the square 's central traffic circle			1
demonstrators shoved the officers , knocking their hats off their heads , and then pursued them as they fled the square			0
by daybreak , the military had withdrawn from @entity7			1
lines of barbed wire and several burned - out trucks blocked vehicle traffic from entering the area			0
the clashes came a day after large crowds of protesters amassed at @entity7 , many of them angry with @entity8 's new military rulers			1
after @entity24 's ouster in february , the military took control -- riding a wave of popularity for refusing to fire on pro-democracy protesters during 18 days of anti-government protests			1
but in the weeks since , the secretive 20 - man council has produced increasing frustration and criticism from different portions of the @entity8 political spectrum			1
critics have complained of human rights abuses and lack of transparency in the council 's decision - making process			1
on friday , some soldiers joined the protests in a direct challenge to @entity8 's military rulers			2
for long intervals , they took to one of the stages erected in the crowded square and called for the country 's military rulers to be replaced			2
" if they really wanted to prosecute these corrupt officials they would have done it immediately			0
that 's why we are here today , " one of the protesting officers said during the friday protests			0
earlier this week , several military officers took to the @entity147 , recording video statements accusing the chairman of the ruling council , field marshal @entity149 , of protecting @entity24 from prosecution and of leading a counterrevolutionary movement			1
" he should step down			0
he did not learn from the mistakes of the last 60 years			0
military should not run countries , " said @entity156 , who makes a living importing and exporting clothing , on saturday			0
tempers flared at one point between soldiers and citizens outside the gates of the @entity166 , which has been used in past months as a detainment center by the @entity8 military			0
an officer fired shots in the air , prompting angry youths to mob the gates and hurl stones into the museum compound			0
after several minutes , the confrontation subsided			0
the military issued a communique saturday morning , accusing a former member of @entity24 's long - ruling @entity181 of " inciting people in @entity7			1
" the military announced it had issued arrest warrants for @entity181 member @entity184 and several of his associates , after accusing them of being " present in @entity7 after curfew as thugs and scaring the citizens			1
" in scenes reminiscent of street protests last january and february , activists have once again blocked entry into @entity7 , using coils of barbed wire apparently left behind by the military			1
@entity1 's @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report			0
