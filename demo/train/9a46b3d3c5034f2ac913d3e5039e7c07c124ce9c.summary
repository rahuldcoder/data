-- as a mom , i can tell you what a lot of us think but do n't say out loud : @entity7 only really works as a holiday the first five years you 're a mother			1
the first year , it 's a new milestone of your life			0
people want to acknowledge the fact that you 're a mother			1
it 's like they 're saying , " hey ! pay no attention to the fact that you 're perpetually sleep deprived and will be for the next 18 years			1
or that your lactating mammaries no longer belong to you and , in fact , betray you at really inopportune times			0
or that beyond here only lie skeletons of your former social life			0
it 's your day ! we fete you ! " then for the next four years or so it 's really cute to be brought breakfast - in - bed with homemade crayon - on - construction - paper cards and macaroni necklaces			1
oh yes , that works			2
that tugs on every heartstring a mom has ( disregarding that it will take you five hours to clean up the kitchen it took them exactly five minutes to destroy )			0
it 's pretty much every year after that which will end up in the " disappointing holiday " column			2
you know why ? because of @entity47 cards and grocery store bouquets , prepackaged chocolates and @entity7 brunches at overcrowded eateries ( because everyone else had the same idea : " i know ! let 's take mom out for lunch and pay someone else to do for her what she has done for years for us for free ! " )			1
those pre-packaged gifts all let mom know that her offspring know what day it is , but lack the single quality all moms love in a present : effort			2
that 's right , good ol ' sacrificial time and effort that add up to the one sentiment we 're really looking for -- undying gratitude mixed with just a pinch of sorrow for our stretch marks			1
good @entity7 gifts are like geometry class where you are required to show your work in order to get credit			1
moms prefer the " effort element " because it 's the only thing that remotely begins to balance out the fact that we get blamed for a lot			0
ok -- really -- just about everything : what we ate while our child was gestating , how we did / did not discipline them , whether we did not give enough hugs , read enough bedtime stories , gave too much smothering love , what we did / did not expose them to			2
also , opportunities we did / did not afford them			0
if we helped too much with the science project , did not feed them enough protein in their formative preadolescent years , rewarded them with @entity108 during potty training which led to their carb addiction as an adult			2
fill in the blank with your own mother issues			2
so we get 364 days of blame and one day of sorta kinda culturally mandated praise			0
somehow it does n't really balance out			0
but i like to think of @entity7 in terms of a really overused buzzword ( is n't " buzzword " an overused buzzword ? ) these days : " awareness			1
" it 's great for the mothered of the world to be aware of their gratitude for their mother ( or mother figure ) in their life , but i enjoy it for the awareness it brings to me			0
every @entity7 i 'm reminded of what an exhausting privilege it is to get a front row seat to watch these amazing people grow from helpless infants to become people i truly love to hang out with			1
it 's a gift to see them growing into all their gifts and talents and to watch with pride ( and let 's be honest -- concern ) as they begin their own family units			1
it makes me sharply aware of what motherhood really is : 1			0
the hardest job you 'll ever love , 2			0
responsibility without control , and 3			0
a piece of your heart walking around outside your body			1
and having a daughter and daughter - in - love ( i call her " daughter - in - love because it 's more than just a " law " thing ) with babies , let me tell you what most every mother would really love this @entity7 : a kiss , a hug and a nap .			1

@entity176 : @entity7 gifts are like geometry class -- you have to show your work to get credit
" as a holiday , it only really works the first five years you 're a mother "
" motherhood is a piece of your heart walking around outside your body "
