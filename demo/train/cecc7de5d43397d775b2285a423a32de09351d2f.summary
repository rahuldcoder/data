@entity0 was running almost an hour late for his final campaign appearance of the weekend , two days before he faces all - but - certain political doom in tuesday 's @entity4 primary for @entity6 mayor			1
there was a " child care mixup " at home , an aide said			0
@entity0 had to peel off the campaign trail and hustle back to his @entity13 residence to pick up his 20 - month - old son , @entity14			1
@entity0 's wife , @entity15 , has been absent from his side for weeks			1
but a small band of @entity0 volunteers waited patiently for their candidate near the entrance to @entity21 in @entity23 's @entity22 , distributing campaign fliers to a largely disinterested crowd of families soaking in some late summer sun at the @entity28			1
as they lingered , an otherwise normal - looking middle - aged man approached each of the volunteers and angrily thrust a finger in their faces			0
one by one , he scolded them with a nonsensical reprimand : " sexting for mayor ! " he yelled			0
" sexting for mayor ! " by the time @entity0 arrived , the man was gone , and the former congressman avoided yet another public confrontation over the lewd online chats that torpedoed his once - promising mayoral bid			1
these scenes have become an almost daily routine for @entity0 since he admitted in july that his naughty online behavior had continued well after he resigned from @entity45 in 2011 , when he copped to exchanging racy pictures and lurid messages with women he had met on the @entity49			1
@entity0 today is more of a public curiosity than a serious candidate , despite being the best pure political talent in a @entity4 field bereft of charisma and the kind of outsized personalities to which @entity6 voters have become accustomed			2
after once leading the mayor 's race , he is now in a distant fourth place			0
if no candidate captures more than 40 % of the vote in tuesday 's primary -- and front - runner @entity65 just might -- the top two finishers will advance to a runoff election			0
@entity67 still says he can win @entity0 will not be one of them , despite what he tells reporters			2
" i 'm convinced that i 'm going be the next mayor of this city , " @entity0 said sunday during an interview on @entity74 's " @entity73 , " an appearance that seemed wildly discordant with his diminished stature in @entity6 , where the press is mostly ignoring him ( unless he clashes with a loud - mouthed voter )			1
@entity0 challenges man who rebuked him for being ' married to an @entity82 ' scant media coverage but plenty of attention at appearance after appearance during his final weekend of campaigning , a frantic schedule that featured 13 public events and trio of " tele - town halls , " @entity0 attracted scant media attention			1
there were just two members of the press at a @entity0 event saturday in which he presented his " closing arguments " for a fairer tax system to a group of @entity101 - speaking voters from @entity102 , with the assistance of a translator			1
the next day , outside a ymca in the @entity108 where @entity0 was pitching his affordable housing plan , a local news producer who had been detailed to the candidate said he was often the sole journalist at his events			2
after @entity0 concluded his news conference , he asked whether any of the three reporters present had any questions about the topics at hand : public housing , rent regulations , mix - used zoning			1
there were none , so he took a question about @entity65			0
but wherever he showed up during his admirably hectic final push -- on street corners , at community fairs , even at a cricket field in the far reaches of @entity130 -- @entity0 would invariably draw a crowd of onlookers , most of them polite and nearly all of them reaching for their smartphones to document the moment			2
he is the human manifestation of click bait			0
while @entity0 chatted with a voter on the corner of 105th and @entity141 about expansion plans for @entity143 and @entity144 , an open - topped @entity6 tour bus pulled up to a nearby stoplight			1
a heavyset man on the top deck of the bus spotted the candidate on the sidewalk -- from a 40 - yard distance , no less -- and started flailing his arms and screaming at the top of his lungs : " @entity0 ! @entity0 ! @entity0 ! " @entity0 paused and waved back			1
" welcome to @entity6 ! stay as long as you want ! spend lots of money ! " in the closing days of the race , @entity0 seems to be living in a sweet spot between shamelessness and fortitude , soldiering on in the face of mockery and barely any hope of winning			1
if he cracks double digits on tuesday , it will be a surprise			0
voters ca n't quite seem to figure out why he did n't quit the race weeks ago			0
@entity170 , a @entity171 from @entity172 who runs a nonprofit , came upon one of @entity0 's " closing argument " events saturday while walking through @entity177 in upper @entity23			1
like hundreds of @entity6 before and after him , he looked on curiously , snapped a picture and promptly posted it to @entity180			0
" it makes no sense to me at all , " @entity170 said of @entity0 's campaign			1
" i am assuming he 's running so that for his next step , his next office , he can say he 's cleansed himself			0
you go through the process , you get vilified to whatever degree , and then you can run again for something else			0
" what could have been where some see desperation , others wonder what could have been			0
" @entity0 is the best political performer in this field and is progressive and tough enough in his policies and rhetoric that he 'd be at or near the top of this race were it not for his scandals , " said one veteran of @entity6 politics who , because of friends working in rival campaigns , did not want to be named saying something nice about the man who called himself @entity202			1
@entity0 's brazenness , energy and full - blown @entity213 offer a stark contrast to the cautious and consultant - driven personas of his @entity4 opponents			1
at a @entity219 forum hosted by the rev. @entity220 on saturday , @entity0 held forth on the topic of civil rights , referring to members of the @entity226 - @entity225 audience as " my brothers and sisters			1
" when @entity0 mistakenly referred to @entity220 as " rev. @entity229 , " he had the crowd in stitches with his quick recovery : " thank you ! good night ! " even the front - running @entity65 could n't match @entity0 's effortless wit and ability to read a crowd			1
the next morning , @entity0 called into @entity237 , the venerable @entity6 hip - hop radio station			1
asked to name his favorite rappers , @entity0 quickly won over the djs			2
" i 'm a big fan of @entity240 ; i like @entity241 , " he answered			0
" but i 'm little more a of dance hall reggae guy than a hip - hop guy			0
none of this is to say that @entity0 , freed from the burden of expectations , is feeling loose and breezy as his campaign winds down			1
arriving at staged press events where there might only be one reporter waiting for him , @entity0 can wear a pained look on his face , his jaw clenched tightly as he prepares to go through the motions of his outlining his policy positions even though they have no hope of making the papers			2
" lucky ducky artichucky , " he muttered to himself as he prepared to speak to a single @entity262 camera at his ymca event			0
one reporter described his demeanor lately as " sheepish , " which is how @entity0 looked when he arrived an hour late to @entity22 holding the hand of his son , @entity14 , who was wearing the world 's tiniest fedora			2
" see the hat ? he 's bringing sexy back , " @entity0 said			2
as with everywhere he goes , observers hung back as @entity0 walked along the @entity277 waterfront , looking on curiously and snapping pictures			2
mothers and fathers pushing strollers looked annoyed as @entity0 's entourage clogged the walkway			2
" you 've got to be kidding me , " one woman exclaimed			0
the appearance was billed as a " retail " event , but @entity0 shook few hands , instead tending to his child and walking along the @entity277 waterfront for the benefit of the cameras			2
the fact that @entity0 is now being trailed at all times by filmmaker @entity294 , a former producer for the @entity296 reality series " made , " only adds to the sense that his campaign , in its final days , is as much performance art as pursuit of office			1
@entity0 is asked how he steels himself for this perplexing ritual every morning before he leaves his apartment			0
" this is the only campaign i know how to run , " he explains , pointing to the dozens of news ideas he has floated during the campaign			0
" every single i day i get up and i think , i am going to run the campaign @entity6 want			0
this is where i am comfortable			0
this is what i like doing , and this has always worked for me			0
so i am not going to stop			0

@entity0 makes his " closing arguments " in mayoral campaign that he once led
in closing days of race , @entity0 seems to be living between shamelessness and fortitude
his new @entity213 offers stark contrast to consultant - driven personas of his opponents
