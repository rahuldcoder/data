-- after two years of denial about the @entity2 periphery 's solvency problem , @entity2 policymakers are finally , grudgingly , facing reality			1
they are recognizing that @entity8 is almost certain to default by year - end			2
and they have concluded that it is imperative to recapitalize @entity2 's banks and to erect an effective " firewall " around @entity16 and @entity17 to reassure markets that if @entity8 defaults , the crisis will be contained there			1
but it remains to be seen whether this recognition will be translated into credible and effective measures by the time of the scheduled november 3 @entity22			0
if past performance is any guide , one has to wonder whether this will be yet another doleful instance of domestic political constraints , especially in @entity27 and @entity28 , resulting in a " too little too late " @entity2 policy response to an ever deepening crisis			2
how deep ? @entity8 's @entity32 adjustment program is in tatters			2
the @entity32 itself is now acknowledging that @entity8 's economy , which has already contracted by around 12 % since 2009 , will contract meaningfully further in 2012			2
and the @entity32 is also recognizing that @entity8 will not meet the @entity32 's budget targets for 2011 and 2012			0
as a result , @entity8 's public - debt - to - gdp level will soon rise to 172 % , or more than twice the level that might be considered manageable			2
as if to underline how unsustainable is the @entity8 situation , in the midst of the deepest of domestic recessions , the @entity8 government is now being required by the @entity32 to undertake further painful fiscal adjustment measures to meet its ever elusive budget deficit targets			0
not only is the @entity32 insisting that @entity8 introduce an unpopular property tax , but it is also asking a @entity47 , or @entity48 , government whose very existence depends on public sector patronage , to cut public wages and to reduce public employment			0
little wonder that social and political tensions in @entity8 are now on the boil			0
the @entity32 is acknowledging that the @entity8 government will need more funding to finance its 2012 budget deficit			0
this is inducing the @entity32 to seek substantially greater debt reduction from @entity8 's bank creditors through the " voluntary " debt exchange			0
as might be expected , the banks are resisting the @entity32 's proposal , and this could complicate the @entity32 finalizing its intended program review by mid-november			0
mindful of the 2008 - 2009 @entity70 experience , @entity2 policymakers are fully aware that a @entity8 default could cause real contagion to the rest of the @entity2 periphery			1
they are particularly fearful that a @entity8 default could engulf @entity16 and @entity17 , @entity2 's third and fourth largest economies respectively , which would pose an existential threat to the @entity79			1
but despite these perceived risks , and reflecting domestic political constraints from electorates opposed to further bailouts , @entity2 policymakers seem to be in no rush to put a credible firewall in place			1
in particular , they have yet to come up with a concrete proposal to leverage up the @entity89 -- the euro zone 's temporary bailout fund -- from its present size of eur 440 billion ( $ 600 billion ) to the eur 2 trillion range ( $ 2.8 trillion ) , that most market analysts think would be needed to shield @entity16 and @entity17 from the fallout of a hard @entity8 default			1
and responding to increased banking sector strains that both the @entity32 and the @entity99 fear could tip @entity2 back into recession , @entity2 policymakers are proposing a coordinated @entity2 effort to recapitalize the @entity2 banking system			1
however , they have yet to come up with concrete proposals as to how they will increase the @entity2 banking system 's capital by the eur 200 billion ( $ 267 billion ) that the @entity32 estimates would be necessary to put @entity2 's banks back on a sound footing			1
public differences between the @entity28 and the @entity27 governments on who should pay for the bank recapitalization are not encouraging			0
the late @entity115 economics professor @entity114 famously said that in economics things take longer to happen than you think they will , and then they happen faster than you thought they could			0
hopefully , @entity2 policymakers will now recognize that in @entity8 we are all too likely to be in " the faster than you thought they could " phase of the crisis			1
for if they do , we might dare to hope that they will act expeditiously in constructing an effective firewall -- recapitalizing their banks in a manner that will spare us from a @entity70 - style crisis when @entity8 defaults			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			0

@entity134 : @entity2 policymakers finally facing likelihood of @entity8 default
he says they know they must recapitalize @entity2 's banks to stop " contagion 's " *spread*
he says action difficult politically , bailout unpopular , so they have not taken any concrete steps yet
@entity134 : policymakers must act to create " firewall " to *prevent* @entity70 - style crisis
