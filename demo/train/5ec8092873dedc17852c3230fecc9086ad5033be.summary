most moms will say that " mom judgment " drives them batty and that they long for a day when moms actually stop criticizing one another			1
but how many will admit they actually are n't just on the receiving end , that they do some of the judging themselves ? i 'm not proud to say i 've done my share of it , especially when i see a child having a meltdown in a restaurant			2
my compassionate self remembers when my daughters went boneless on me as toddlers , but from time to time , a quick judgy thought comes before the sensitivity : " should n't that mom do something to control her child ? " @entity23 , founder and manager of the site @entity26 , says she 's guilty of having similar thoughts when she sees a child having a tantrum in a store			1
but here 's the million - dollar question : why are we so quick to judge other moms ? " i think a lot of it stems from feeling strongly attached to our own opinions and choices , " said @entity23 , a mom of a 3 - year - old daughter in @entity36 , @entity37			1
" when we hold tightly to our opinions of what we think is best , it can be hard to understand that others might do something different than we do , and that 's completely ok			1
" tired of all the judging and hoping to help pave the way for more sisterhood and support among moms , @entity23 and her fellow moms at @entity49 have delivered an encore to their fabulous photo spread " end the @entity57 , " which went viral last year			1
in the latest one , which they call " hugs , @entity62 , " moms hold up signs with messages such as " the mom in me honors the mom in you			1
" another sign reads , " if it works for you and your family , stick with it			0
try not to think about what everyone else thinks			0
" and another , which says , " trust your instinct			0
you have the power to know what 's best for your children			1
" " in a culture that likes to pit moms against moms , it 's rare to see images of us coming together in a loving , supportive way , " @entity23 said			1
" take one look at your @entity93 news feed , and you 're bound to see at least one headline from either a media outlet or parenting website that encourages judgment by saying things like ' 10 reasons breastfeeding is best			0
' " ( the judgment there : if you do n't breastfeed , you are clearly not doing enough to take care of your baby ! ) why are we so quick to cry ' bad mother ' ? i 'm all for ending the judgment , but is n't it wishful thinking to believe we can actually kiss it goodbye and replace it with sisterhood and camaraderie ? i mean , how can you prevent that judgy voice from rearing its ugly head ? @entity23 has one piece of advice , and in my humble opinion , it 's something you can actually do			2
the minute a judgy thought enters your mind , how about replacing it with a positive one ? instead of wondering why the mom in @entity129 ca n't get her son or daughter under control , @entity23 wrote in a blog post , how about thinking something like , " maybe that mom has had a really hard day and geez my kid has tantrums , too , i do n't know what her situation is like so who am i to judge it ? " and then i feel a million times better because it feels better to choose love over judgment			0
it 's like we 're not only giving our own heart a little hug			2
we 're giving that other mom a little hug too ( albeit , in our mind )			0
" longing for the carefree parenting style of yesterday ? easy enough , right ? i hope the next time my parenting is less than perfect in public , which could be as early as this evening , another mom will try this approach			0
she 'll feel better , and i will , too			0
how do you think we can stop moms from judging other moms ? tell @entity159 on @entity160 or @entity161 on @entity93 .			2
