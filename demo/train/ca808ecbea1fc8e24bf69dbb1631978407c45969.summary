are bringing you down , here 's how to deal			2
post-swim under - eye creases cause : suction , which helps keep out water , can also cause goggle frames to sink deep into the delicate tissue under the eyes , accentuating puffiness and dark circles , says @entity15 , @entity16 , a board - certified dermatologist in @entity18 , @entity19 ( home of the @entity21 )			1
solution : while there 's no such thing as a crease - free pair of goggles ( especially if you have noticeably deep tear troughs ) , your best bet is to find a pair that does n't sit directly under the eyes , says @entity15 , who not only treats triathletes but is also an @entity35 champion			1
either go small , with the race series by @entity37 or the @entity39 goggles ( kids ' frames tend to cover less of the eye area ) , or find a wider mask that hits lower on the face			1
the swimwear company @entity45 is owned by the diving outfitter @entity47 , and the scuba influence can be seen in the broader design of its @entity51 goggles and , especially , in the @entity53 swim mask , which has a soft silicone facial " skirt " that does n't dig into the skin			1
the company says @entity61 swimmer @entity60 trains and races in the @entity63 and wears the @entity64 during open - water fun swims			1
sweaty - hair sideburns cause : short , layered pieces of hair escape your ponytail , slap against your face and stay there until the end of your workout			1
this is not only annoying , but can also lead to breakouts , @entity15 says , especially if those wayward strands are coated in hairspray , gel or other styling products			2
solution : while nylon , cotton , jersey , polyester and @entity88 headbands may stick to thick , textured hair , they can slide off a sweaty head of fine hair			0
a tighter band wo n't necessarily help , but something with a little traction will			0
@entity96 's new slide - proof head wraps have a zigzag of silicone gel on the underside to keep the band - and your hair - in place			1
@entity96 says that in company tests , their head wraps offer 42 percent more hold than wraps made from fabric , jersey or plastic			0
boob bounce cause : researchers at the @entity112 in @entity113 have found that during high - impact activities like running , breasts move not just up and down , but also in a repetitive figure - 8 pattern that is barely controlled by most standard sports bras			1
it sounds perverse , feels miserable and leads to chafing , discomfort , weakened breast tissue and even an unstable stride , found the researchers			0
solution : the sports bra company @entity123 commissioned a portion of the breast - health research from the @entity112			1
its @entity127 bra top encapsulates and lifts the breasts in soft , molded cups that control vertical and lateral sway , has seam - free inner elastics to reduce chafing , and stays put thanks to wide straps			1
when running on a treadmill , a typical sports bra might reduce bounce by about half ; tests show that the @entity123 reduces it by 78 percent			2
@entity144 , a @entity145 lingerie company , was inspired by the @entity112 research to do its own tests			0
last october , @entity144 released a sports bra that reduces bounce by 83 percent			2
workout wedgies cause : during a vigorous workout , ill - fitting bottoms that are too big or too small often migrate to ... somewhere in the middle			1
solution : first , make sure that your bottoms provide ample coverage and have four - way stretch so that they move when you do			2
you 've probably discovered that cotton , which can feel so loose and liberating when you put it on , tends to bunch and sag when it becomes wet with sweat - so instead , look for breathable wicking material like @entity164 or @entity165			1
@entity168 's @entity167 briefs are form - fitting without being form - squeezing and have chafe - free leg openings that wo n't creep up			2
and the @entity171 bikini brief has a smooth , supportive fit that prevents cheek creep with a knit weave that feels soft against the skin			0
sock cankles cause : when bulky athletic socks hit above the narrowest part of the ankle , they shorten the legâ € ” not a good look in shorts , and even worse in capris			0
solution : your instinct is probably to buy superlow tab socks , but these often slip into sneakers , especially if you 're wearing cushioned running , aerobics or trail shoes			0
this can lead to blisters and lots of cursing			0
@entity197 are the @entity198 of athletic socks : they hit very low on the leg but have a supportive ankle band to keep them from slipping under your foot ( they were designed for competitive runners who do n't have time to adjust their socks during a race )			0
these @entity211 are made from a wicking polyester blend and have a double - layer design to prevent excess rubbing , which makes them ultracomfortable for running and flattering for all types of exercise			2
