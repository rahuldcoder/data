-- a nice glass of wine , a puff on a cigar and a few clubs			2
it sounds like a decent night out -- except these clubs are golf clubs			2
when @entity10 became the oldest ever winner on the @entity12 following his triumph at the @entity14 in november , he celebrated in the only way he knew how -- with a big , fat cigar			1
at 49 , @entity10 , who replaced @entity17 as the oldest winner on the @entity12 at the age of 48 and 318 days , is man with a hinterland which stretches well beyond sport			1
while the rest of the world rushes around at breakneck speed , @entity10 often sits , looks out onto the @entity25 and contemplates the meaning of life -- a subject he 's had a lot of time to think about since breaking his leg in a ski accident last december			1
" you have to do whatever you want in your life when you are alive , " @entity10 told @entity0 's @entity33 on location in his hometown of @entity36			1
" i love to ski , i love to drink , i love to smoke , i love to compete and i love to have time with my friends			1
" i do n't want to stop any of those things			2
i 'm sorry , but i 'm honest			0
" @entity42 is so nice , to do what you 're doing in your life , to do what you want in your life -- that 's genuine			1
it does n't matter what			0
" if sport these days is characterized by a winner takes all mentality summed up by legendary @entity54 coach @entity53 's famous remark -- " show me a good loser and i 'll show you a loser " -- then @entity10 's approach is the very antithesis to that philosophy			1
" i do what i like in my life and i 'm not going to change that			0
if a major is coming then it will be ' wow ' , but if the major is not coming , i 'm still going to do what i like with my life			1
" a wry smile appears on his face as he waves his hand towards the camera and adds : " @entity72 , bye major			1
" but do n't let @entity10 's " pleasure pursuit principle " disguise the ambition which still burns fiercely within his heart -- the passion and determination to compete with the latest generation of stars remains as strong as ever			1
" i spend many days a week working at the gym and if i do n't at the age of 49 then i 've no chance of competing with the younger ones , " he said			1
" of course , i really enjoy having my glass of wine , having nice food and just to have a cigar with nice company and i enjoy my life			0
" you know somebody told me a long time ago that this life we 're going to spend more time dead than alive			0
so , when you 're alive , live			0
" however , as he wrings every last ounce of pleasure out of life you wo n't find @entity10 telling the world about it on social media networks			1
while @entity103 tweets to over 3.2 million followers and @entity105 converses with his 1.2 million fans , the @entity102 prefers the old - fashioned method of talking to people			1
" but sometimes people forget that you need to enjoy it , we need to enjoy friends , we need to enjoy family and we need to enjoy the things which happen around ourselves , " said the @entity102			1
" people identify with a lot of modern things such as computers and social networking			0
i feel that people have lost communication between people			0
" now there is a lot of communication by information , but i prefer to touch the people , to talk to the people			0
" @entity10 made his professional debut 30 years ago			1
during that time the clubs have got bigger and heavier -- as have the pay checks and the relentless media attention which comes with life on the @entity12			1
" @entity33 has always been professional , but now it 's getting more so , " he added			1
" people are more into that and are more like horses when they wear blinkers -- they do n't see sideways			0
" you have to be yourself and if you 're like that then it 's fine , you have to respect those things , no ? " @entity10 makes no judgments on how others choose lead their lives , but he is insistence that his laid back and carefree attitude remains at the center of his equilibrium			1
" the most important thing is , and i 've always said the same thing , you have to enjoy what you do in your life , " he said			0
" i do a little bit of this , a little bit of that and my life is going forward			0
" that is what i recommend to people			0
enjoy yourself , enjoy your life and do whatever you want to do in life			0
" but do n't come to play golf if you want to do something else and do n't do something else if you want to do golf			0
" you have to make a compromise with yourself about what you want to do			0
" the affable @entity10 makes his comeback at thursday 's @entity164 at the @entity166 course in @entity167 , providing the @entity102 with an opportunity to test out a body which has been put through months of rehabilitation			1
" it 's made me more determined , " he said			2
" i love the game and these three months of not competing , i 'm missing some important venues			2
" i love to compete			0
it 's the only thing i know how to do properly in my life			2
" it does n't matter whether you win or not , but you 're doing what you like in your life and i stopped doing things			2
" i 've stopped competing with the young guys			0
i 've stopped competing in the tournaments			0
i miss all these things and that 's what i want to do			2
" @entity10 's 19 tour wins remain a source of great pride of satisfaction as does his success with the @entity192 team -- most recently as assistant captain at @entity194			1
while the next few days should give an indication of how his body is holding up , @entity10 is undecided as to how long he will continue playing at the very highest level			1
" i 've seen four kinds of generations and i 've played with them			0
to me i think it 's a privilege to be part of the history with them			2
" i have n't won a major , but i do n't regret anything			1
i feel satisfied to be part of all this , i feel so happy with that			0
" i 'm on the way back , i do n't know for how long			0
to me i will keep competitive or in competition with the young people for as long as i can play well and win a tournament			2
" but if i do n't play well and just finish winning it 's time to go			2
