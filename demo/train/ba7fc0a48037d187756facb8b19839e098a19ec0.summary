-- " it 's very important that @entity1 not become the developer for the world , " @entity0 , @entity1 chief executive , told analysts last month			1
" we need people to invent their own stuff			0
" on monday , he is due to express those same feelings face - to - face with @entity12 , chief executive of @entity13 -- the @entity15 company that @entity1 alleges is the chief culprit in copying its @entity18 and @entity19 inventions			1
their two days of judge - ordered settlement talks in a @entity23 courthouse will attempt to find a resolution to their rival patent claims , before a full - blown jury trial gets under way , scheduled for july			1
this is the key dispute among more than 50 cases that have developed between the two companies over the past year in 10 different countries			0
any agreement hammered out here could bring others round the world to a swift conclusion			0
" i do n't know if the parties will settle ; this case is just one part of a very complex ecosystem , and putting ceos in the room together is always a roll of the dice , " says @entity38 , a professor at @entity39			0
" but both parties need to settle the larger war and get on with innovating			0
fighting all the patent battles to the end will leave no one the victor			0
" @entity1 seems to be the one more eager for a resolution at present , and not just because of @entity0 's feelings			2
" i 've always hated litigation and i continue to hate it ... i would highly prefer to settle versus battle , " he said in april			0
the urgency for @entity1 and its lawyers is that @entity13 has overtaken it in smartphone sales on the back of @entity1 's leadership in innovation			1
it shipped 45m smartphones in the first quarter , according to @entity68 , compared with @entity1 's 35m			2
" @entity13 has vaulted into first place in worldwide sales of smartphones , with massive sales of its copycat products , " alleged a recent @entity1 filing			1
" @entity13 's infringement of @entity1 's intellectual property has already resulted in damages that reach billions of dollars			1
" @entity1 has pursued injunctions and import bans to try to keep not just @entity13 out of its markets , but @entity82 and @entity83 as well , all three @entity85 users of @entity88 's rival @entity87 operating system			1
@entity82 's latest @entity90 phone was impounded by @entity91 last week following an @entity93 decision in @entity1 's favour			2
@entity1 filed on friday for an injunction to ban @entity13 's @entity97 tablet			1
the battle with @entity13 began in @entity99 in april 2011 , with @entity1 filing a 373 - page complaint of patent and trademark infringement			1
other skirmishes have since broken out in @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , the @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity15			0
@entity1 's original complaint includes allegations that @entity13 infringed on elements of the @entity18 's look -- its rectangular shape , rounded corners , silver edges , black face and display of icons			1
it also alleges @entity13 copied features such as the way instant messaging was displayed and even mimicked @entity1 's trademarked touch - icons for applications such as phone , contacts , photos and @entity130			1
@entity13 hit back with its own list of alleged patent infringements by @entity1 -- backed by its 6,000 - strong @entity134 telecoms patent portfolio and its claim to have first introduced a smartphone as far back as 1999			1
the key patents @entity13 relied on all relate to the inner workings of phones and how they connect to 3g networks			2
@entity141 , an independent patent analyst , says that @entity13 could land itself in more trouble by going to war with patents that are essential to standards such as @entity147			2
antitrust authorities are already investigating whether these should be " @entity153 " patents -- available for anyone to use under " fair , reasonable and non-discriminatory " terms			0
for its part , @entity1 is fighting over design elements that are already disappearing in newer models as companies figure out workarounds to possible infringements			0
for example , @entity87 phones and tablets are " unlocked " by swiping from inside a circle on their touchscreens now , rather than swiping along a bar , as on the @entity18			0
@entity167 , chairman of @entity168 , a @entity134 patent analysis company , says there is so much " prior art " -- earlier innovations covering similar ground -- that @entity1 and @entity13 are inviting subsequent third - party litigation by airing the strengths and weaknesses of their patents in public			1
" third - party patent holders , of which there are literally thousands in this space , are salivating over the fact that you are going to have this ongoing acrimony , allowing people essentially to learn where constructive claims of infringement can be made , " he says			2
@entity1 did not respond to a request for comment on its litigation			0
however , for @entity1 at least , it is about far more than banning rival products , winning damages or earning royalties in any future licensing agreements , according to mr @entity141			2
" it 's critical that its products continue to be able to distinguish themselves with unique features , " he says			0
" that 's what drives consumers to buy them , that 's what sustain its margins and make this all worth tens even hundreds of billions of dollars to @entity1			0
