-- the luck of the @entity2 may not be enough to push ahead special legislation introduced by sen. @entity4 , @entity5 , to grant 10,500 special work visas for @entity2 immigrants			1
@entity4 proposed the legislation in the midst of a neck - and - neck re-election battle in @entity5 , which has the highest percentage of @entity12 of @entity2 descent			1
@entity4 is serving out the term of the late sen. @entity15 , who was extremely popular with @entity2 - @entity12 because of his work on the @entity2 peace process			1
@entity4 has predicted that his legislation would " pop " soon , in plenty of time for @entity22 marches that are magnets for @entity24 politicians			2
" the @entity2 economy crashed in 2008			2
people have come and overstayed visas			0
the @entity2 - @entity12 vote here is substantial , " said @entity28 , an @entity2 - @entity12 businessman in @entity29			1
" this would be welcome relief and a recognition of the strong ties between @entity5 and @entity35			0
" but @entity36 , a conservative organization that supports reducing immigration , is lobbying hard against the bill , questioning why the @entity12 would bring in skilled foreign workers to compete with @entity12 citizens in the midst of a recession			2
@entity43 of @entity36 called @entity4 's bill an election - year ploy to gain favoritism for one ethnic group			1
" what about @entity49 ? what about @entity52 and @entity53 ? " he said			0
" there is no reason why we should give this privilege			0
" the unemployment rate in @entity5 , according to the @entity59 , is 6.9 %			0
the unemployment rate in @entity35 is 14.2 %			0
the renewable visas @entity4 's legislation seeks would expire every two years			1
the bill is also opposed by the @entity64 , an organization that typically sides with republicans on immigration issues			0
it derided @entity4 's proposal as a throwback to the days when immigration was based on national origin			1
in addition , @entity72 , which calls itself non-partisan organization , said that while it supports reform of immigration laws it has called into question the motivations behind giving a special visa status to @entity2 nationals			2
on illegal immigration issues , which largely affect immigrants from @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity4 has been in line with his party			0
he has spoken against creating magnets for illegal immigration and has opposed the @entity90 , which would grant permanent residency to college graduates who entered the @entity12 illegally as children			0
but , in an e-mail statement to @entity0 , @entity4 's office said his @entity97 visa legislation was different			1
" for decades , the @entity2 have been unfairly shut out by our immigration laws			0
in an effort to increase visa prospects and maintain the close bond between the @entity12 and @entity35 , sen. @entity4 is working in a bipartisan way to add the @entity97 program to larger , @entity107 - passed visa legislation that benefits several other countries			1
" in a recent editorial , the @entity109 said @entity2 immigrants have already been given ample favoritism			0
" @entity4 argues that @entity35 deserves special visas because changes in @entity12 immigration policy have disproportionately limited the numbers of @entity2 workers for decades			1
but @entity35 has often benefited from temporary exemptions			0
in 1986 , rep. @entity119 , a @entity5 @entity120 , pushed for a visa lottery that awarded 4,161 visas to @entity2 applicants out of the first 10,000			1
in the 1990s , rep. @entity124 , a @entity125 @entity120 , created a program that gave out 120,000 green cards -- 48,000 reserved for @entity2 applicants , whose undocumented immigrants had been left out of an earlier amnesty program			0
" @entity4 's @entity131 opponent , @entity130 , said the visa system is badly broken			1
" we need to reform the visa system for talented @entity2 men and women coming to this country , and more generally we need to reform the visa system as a whole , " she said			0
sen. @entity139 , @entity141 - @entity140 , introduced legislation in the @entity107 in november that would eliminate per - country caps for employment - based immigration applications from countries with large backlogs like @entity147 and @entity148			0
it would also grant visa waivers to undocumented @entity2 immigrants , a move widely unpopular with @entity153			2
@entity4 's standalone @entity155 bill on @entity97 visas for the @entity2 , @entity157 , followed in december with no provision for undocumented immigrants			1
@entity4 's bill was added to @entity139 's broader proposal , which eliminated the provision for undocumented immigrants			1
but sen. @entity163 , @entity164 , placed a hold on this bill when it came over to the @entity155			0
@entity167 , communications director for @entity163 , said he has now extended an offer to move the @entity4 bill forward			2
" an up or down vote on sen. @entity4 's @entity2 visa bill would be acceptable to sen. @entity163 with some modifications dealing with the skill level of those receiving an @entity97 visa , the current visa program the visas would be allotted from , and the inclusion of a sunset on the program , " @entity180 wrote in an e-mail			1
" sen. @entity163 's staff is still discussing modifications with the sponsors of the bill			2

sen. @entity4 backs bill for 10,500 special work visas for the @entity2
@entity4 represents @entity5 , home to many @entity12 of @entity2 descent
@entity4 's bill has been *blocked* by a fellow @entity153 who wants the bill changed
