-- " we all dream of a team of @entity4 " is a tribute to @entity8 's former player and cult hero , @entity6 , which dares to imagine a first 11 made up entirely of the club 's legendary defender			1
it seems @entity14 's @entity13 's mind is set on something else			1
the striker posted a photo on his @entity19 page featuring a @entity21 sticker book featuring the entire @entity14 squad made up entirely of his own stickers			1
it shows some real application on the part of @entity27 , as he is affectionately known -- it would n't have been that easy to get so many copies of his own sticker			2
the @entity32 is a divisive figure and has had more than his fair share of off - field headlines			0
the @entity38 striker , who broke @entity40 hearts in @entity41 over the weekend by scoring the winning goal in their group d match , is well known for not only his on - field prowess but also a series of ill - judged pranks , including one which culminated in his setting his house on fire with fireworks while at @entity53			0
that got him plenty of column inches , which he lapped up , acknowledging the fascination with his hijinks by wearing a t - shirt on - field which read , " why always me ? " now , it seems he 's answered his own question with his vision for the perfect @entity32 lineup			0
why not only him ?			0

@entity13 has a little fun with his *panini* sticker album
striker 's self - regarding @entity19 picture shows a full @entity14 squad made up of his photos
