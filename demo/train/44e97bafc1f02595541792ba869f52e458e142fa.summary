-- as so often happens , news of @entity3 's latest leadership move trickled out from the regime 's official @entity5 news agency and hinted at a power shift in @entity8			1
in a report published on the country 's @entity22 celebrations , the government mouthpiece named @entity13 - so , a senior official of the ruling @entity15 and one of @entity19 's closest confidantes , as director of the general @entity9 of the @entity11			1
the position is seen as the military 's top political office			0
beyond a cursory mention of @entity13 's new title , the news agency did not elaborate on changes behind the political curtain			1
promotion the role is the top military position after @entity19 , who is supreme commander of the armed forces			2
@entity13 was promoted to vice marshal just ahead of the @entity5 report that named him as the new military political chief			2
previously , vice marshal @entity39 held the position			0
while in the job , @entity39 was widely regarded by @entity3 watchers as second only to @entity19 in terms of political clout			1
however , speculation about his position has been rife following reports that he may have been arrested , some months ago			0
this conjecture appeared to have been unfounded as he maintained his position and had been a visible member of the regime until very recently , although his absence may have been due to poor health			0
the @entity5 's @entity55 report , however , seems to have definitively denuded him of his power			0
in the same piece that effectively coronated @entity13 , @entity39 was referred to as a party secretary in charge of labor groups -- a relatively minor position			1
political consolidation it 's not the first time that @entity19 , who took power in 2011 , has made personnel changes at the top			2
moves -- some more high profile than others -- seem to be efforts by @entity19 to consolidate his position by elevating his own confidantes over those who served his father , the @entity76			0
in december 2013 , he removed his uncle by marriage , @entity79 , from his position as top adviser and one of the most influential persons in the political hierarchy of @entity3 in a very public purge			1
@entity19 had the man who was considered to be a close adviser of the scion of the @entity19 dynasty , which has ruled the @entity3 since the @entity90 , executed and all but wiped from the record			1
despite the eggshells that seem to surround the country 's most influential political positions , it is not thought that @entity96 has suffered the same fate as @entity79			2
purge unlikely a @entity99 source told the @entity100 that it is unlikely that @entity96 has been purged			0
seasoned @entity3 watchers echo the line			1
an editorial on the independent specialist site @entity106 said that " it appears ... @entity96 is not being purged so much as being gradually phased out of power , " while 38 @entity108 said that the news showed " so far no indication that it represents another broad purge such as occurred with @entity79 last december			0
" the move comes as the international community suspects the secretive state to be gearing up for another nuclear test , as well as rattling its neighbors with further live fire drills			0
@entity3 conducts live - fire exercises amid escalating tensions @entity3 says it has @entity120 in custody @entity122 : @entity3 ready for nuclear test			2

@entity3 state media names @entity127 - so as influential military figure
@entity13 apparently *replaces* @entity39 , who may have fallen out of favor
@entity3 watchers do *n't* think @entity39 will suffer same fate as @entity19 's uncle
