after the @entity3 - led coalition has battled the @entity5 , firing thousands of airstrikes across @entity7 and @entity8 , the terrorist group that aims to establish a brutal @entity1 is gaining ground -- literally			1
while there is an example of @entity16 ' brutality nearly every day , terrorism experts such as @entity4 's @entity11 and @entity12 remind us tuesday that it 's critical to look at the big and frightening picture of what 's happening			1
@entity11 explains what @entity16 is after in this @entity4 story tuesday -- the end times , the apocalypse			1
it 's high time , @entity11 argues , that the @entity3 and others stop trying to rationalize @entity16 ' behavior as rational			1
@entity12 breaks down how and why @entity16 is gaining momentum in many other countries besides @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity16 fighters launched a major assault tuesday night southwest of @entity34 , @entity31 officials said			1
a " big attack " is taking place near the towns of @entity38 and @entity39 , one @entity31 source told @entity4			1
the towns are some 45 kilometers ( 28 miles ) from @entity34 , the @entity31 capital			1
@entity31 officials said they were concerned @entity16 fighters would break through their lines			1
if that happens , there would be little standing between @entity16 and the @entity31 capital , though tuesday 's attacks are likely aimed at drawing the already stretched @entity31 forces in many different directions to relieve the pressure on @entity51 , which @entity16 seized in june			1
there appears to be growing support within the @entity3 to use force against @entity16 and increasing dissatisfaction about how president @entity57 's administration has dealt with the group			1
a new @entity4 / @entity60 survey found that 57 % of the @entity3 questioned disapprove of how @entity57 is handling the threat			1
in late september , 49 % said they disapproved of the administration 's strategy			2
fifty - four percent of 1,027 people polled between february 12 - 15 said they disapproved of how the president is handling terrorism in general			2
seventy - three percent said they support the use of force against @entity16			2
@entity4 's senior political analyst @entity73 said he was surprised to see that 47 % of the people polled said they approve of sending ground forces to fight @entity16			1
whether that 's a true portrayal of how @entity3 feel is unclear , he noted			0
the poll comes as @entity16 beheaded 21 @entity79 coptic christians this weekend in @entity80 and put the video of the slayings online , a well - worn propaganda tactic the extremists often use			2
and yet support for the terror group is growing among some citizens in @entity79 , which is often called the cradle of the @entity88			0
the murders of the @entity91 minority group took place in @entity80 , where @entity16 is also establishing a strong following in the absence of a stable government in that nation			1
the country has been in turmoil since the @entity100 demonstrations that ultimately led to the overthrow of dictator @entity102 in 2011			0
@entity79 reacted to the slayings with a fiery air campaign against @entity16 in @entity80			2
@entity105 has never been a stable place , and @entity16 is exploiting that and establishing a fan base there			2
@entity16 also has followers in @entity111 and @entity112 , @entity12 noted			1
the leader of @entity114 , which has ravaged northern @entity115 , has said he admires @entity16 leader @entity116			2
last week , a top @entity3 counterterrorism official warned that the number of foreign fighters joining the ranks of @entity16 is growing at an alarming rate , and that scores of them are from the @entity3			2
on another front in @entity126 , the battle against @entity16 has manifested in so - called lone wolf actors staging attacks			2
@entity4 reported that a gunman who had sworn allegiance to @entity16 murdered a filmmaker and later a synagogue guard in @entity133 , @entity134 , over the weekend			1
nerves are still frayed in the city as police on tuesday cordoned off the area around a cafe			0
the gathering there saturday was intended to be a forum on freedom of expression in the wake of the @entity148 @entity147 attack			0
@entity150 artist @entity149 was at the cafe			0
years ago he drew the @entity152 as a dog , an act that landed him on a terrorist hit list			0
watch why images of the prophet are so offensive to some @entity158 @entity159 told @entity4 that someone saved his life at the cafe by shoving him into a storage room			2
on tuesday , the artist told @entity4 's @entity165 that he felt he had no other choice but to go into hiding			1
the gunman 's motives may be tied to a suspicious letter left only steps away from a bank of flowers in a memorial near the cafe			0
read more about the prohibition of drawing the prophet a post on @entity178 that allegedly belonged to the shooter read , " allegiance to @entity116 in full obedience in the good and bad things			0
and i wo n't dispute with him unless it is an outrageous disbelief			0
" a @entity178 friend of the suspect , 22 - year - old @entity187 , told @entity4 he believed the page matched @entity187 's profile			1
on tuesday , the @entity190 confirmed that it received a report from the @entity134 prison service last year warning that @entity187 was at risk of radicalization			0
@entity187 was killed in a shootout with police after the killing at the synagogue			0
the @entity3 is considering providing teams of moderate @entity8 rebels with the capability to call in @entity3 airstrikes via @entity204 , a @entity3 defense official told @entity4			1
but a decision has n't yet been made on that possibility , which was first reported by @entity207			0
even if that capability is provided , the @entity3 would not conduct any airstrikes without some sort of additional confirming intelligence , independent of the @entity8 rebels , the official said			2
it could be part of a @entity3 plan to provide the @entity8 rebel teams with a variety of gear to carry out the task of defending local areas from @entity16 , and eventually being able to conduct offensive operations , the official said			1
the gear is expected to include pickups , machine guns , communications and gps equipment , the official said			0
it is also expected that mortars will be provided			0
no decision has been made yet on providing more sophisticated anti-tank weapons			0
the first @entity3 trainers are expected in @entity234 at the beginning of march			0
training sessions are expected to last six to eight weeks			0
the official would not say how many teams will be outfitted , although the @entity3 hopes to train about 5,000 rebel forces			0
also on tuesday , the @entity240 convened a three - day summit on @entity242			0
at least 60 nations are participating			0
tuesday 's agenda will focus on three cities -- @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 -- that have pilot programs to battle extremism			0
officials and leaders from those cities will share what they 've learned			0
