@entity0 -- a lost interview of @entity3 recorded more than five decades ago , but recently found in a @entity5 attic , will soon be heard in the last room where the civil rights leader slept			1
@entity9 @entity8 purchased the reel - to - reel tape wednesday and will donate it to the @entity11 , which is housed in the @entity11			1
@entity3 was shot to death standing on a balcony of the @entity15 , motel on april 4 , 1968			1
" it gave me chills , " @entity8 told @entity1 wednesday in a phone interview , explaining why he bought the tape for an undisclosed amount			1
it was striking because the recording revealed @entity3 in a relaxed mood , @entity8 said			1
" we 've heard dr. @entity3 talk about peaceful change in the public forum , but this is an audio tape of him talking conversationally , " he said			1
" i 'm certainly no expert , but it 's the first time i 've ever heard him in that context and i was very moved by it			0
" @entity8 said he wanted to give the recording to the museum because it " is just the right thing to do			1
" " he 's certainly one of the great inspirational figures in history , " @entity8 said			2
" so much of what i do , in my own little way , is making people dream , transporting them , making them think differently			0
that 's what magic does			0
his dream was far greater than any entertainer can provide			0
" @entity46 , a collector and expert on rare historical artifacts , authenticated the reel and appraised it at $ 100,000 last month			2
" when i heard it , i got goose bumps all over , " @entity46 said , " it feels like he 's sitting in your living room and talking to you			0
" the museum will put the recording on exhibit in the motel room where @entity3 stayed his last nights in @entity15 , @entity46 said			1
@entity61 , the museum 's director of education and interpretation , confirmed the donation and said museum officials " look forward to its receipt and sharing it with our ( 150,000 ) - plus visitors			0
" " we are extremely grateful for the generosity and high regard mr. @entity8 holds for the @entity11 , " @entity61 told @entity1			1
@entity46 arranged the sale by @entity74 , who found it in a dusty old attic in @entity77 , @entity5 , while rummaging through dilapidated boxes left there by his father many years before			1
in one of the battered boxes was an audio reel marked , " dr. @entity3 interview , dec. 21 , 1960			1
" @entity74 realized it was his father interviewing @entity3 about nonviolence and the civil rights movement			1
@entity74 's father had grown up in @entity5 during the years of racial tension , oppression , and the so - called " @entity92 " segregation laws			1
" he planned on writing a book on how bad things were back in that era , " said @entity74 , but his father never finished the book			2
" he fell ill , and is now in hospice care			0
" @entity74 's father 's recorded his conversation with @entity3 three years before the civil rights leader delivered his famous " @entity106 " speech in @entity102 , four years before president @entity103 signed the @entity104 into law and eight years before @entity3 was assassinated in @entity15 , across the state from where @entity74 's father lived			1
in the interview , @entity3 can clearly be heard discussing his definition of nonviolence , and its importance in the civil rights movement			2
" i would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end through moral means , " he said , " and it grows out of the whole concept of love , because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving spirit , he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves the opponent			0
" @entity3 continued , " i am convinced that when the history books are written in future years , historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our heritage , " he said			2
" it represents struggle on the highest level of dignity and discipline			0
" the rev. @entity136 , one of the founders of the @entity138 with @entity3 in 1957 , said the tapes are a reminder of the work king started that is not finished			2
" one of the things that occurred back then , we effectively communicated that nonviolence as a tactic , as a technique , was very effective for civil rights protests , " said @entity136			0
" what we failed to do was express it 's not just a tactic , but a way of life			0
" @entity136 went on , " we 're losing the battle of violence versus nonviolence as a means of resolving human conflict , " he said , " i hope dr. @entity3 's message , wherever it shows up will help us in the struggle			2
" in another part of @entity74 's recording , @entity3 describes a recent trip to @entity165			1
he explains to @entity74 's father the importance of the civil rights movement both in the @entity169 and abroad			2
" there is quite a bit of interest and concern in @entity165 for the situation in the @entity169			0
@entity165 leaders in general , and @entity165 people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and familiar with what has taken place , " he said , " we must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world , and if we expect to maintain a moral voice in a world that is two thirds color			0
" the recording is intriguing to @entity189 , a professor of history and founding director of the @entity192 at @entity193			0
" it 's hard to know what we 're dealing with , " he said , " there are thousands of interviews with dr. @entity3 , and it 's hard to tell the historical significance of this ( one )			2
" " what is interesting about this is rather than just a transcript , you can hear his voice , " he added			0
in 1985 , @entity3 's widow , the late @entity207 , invited @entity189 to direct a long - term project to edit and publish the civil rights leader 's works			1
based on the dates , @entity189 believes the @entity165 trip @entity3 mentioned in the recording was his trip to @entity215			1
this is what @entity189 and his colleagues are most interested in			0
" the trip to @entity215 is something we do n't have a lot of information about , " he said , " in @entity215 he did n't do press conferences , did n't do interviews or write letters we know of			0
" @entity1 's @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 @entity8 will donate the tape to the @entity11
