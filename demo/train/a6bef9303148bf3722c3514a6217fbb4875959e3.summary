i flew down immediately , " she wrote			0
but that did n't stop her father from milking it as he asked @entity236 to " do it with class " next time and let him know if she was doing an " artistic film			0
she almost did n't get the part in " @entity96 , " because the studio had an issue with her ethnicity " i went through several more callbacks			0
the studio , as i was told , had a problem that i was @entity5 ; they were worried about the interracial aspect , " @entity15 wrote			1
but @entity100 and @entity99 fought to get her the part			0
she wrote that she was " grateful that they put themselves out there like that , " because " that 's the only way things change -- when everyone joins the fight and you 're not the only one rushing up the hill			0

nobody was prosecuted in the case , @entity15 said in an interview			2

indeed , it was n't until she was an adult that she went to therapy			0
" if someone was to punch you in the face for 18 years of your life , would n't you go to the hospital to get it treated ? it 's the same thing when it comes to mental and physical abuse as well , " @entity3 said to @entity0			1
