-- new guidelines for the management of hypertension suggest that people 60 or older might be able to handle higher blood pressure readings than originally thought			1
hypertension , which can lead to strokes , heart attack , kidney failure and death , is traditionally treated with medication and diet			0
the goal of most doctors is to keep their patient 's blood pressure below 140 ( systolic ) / 90 ( diastolic )			1
but after reviewing mounds of evidence , a committee of experts now says the systolic number , especially in older people , can be higher at 150/90			1
and many of these patients who were on medication would no longer need to be			0
it is not clear how many people would be affected by these new guidelines , but experts are estimating in the millions			2
the committee was asked to update the guidelines that have been in place for more than 30 years			0
they were published online wednesday in the latest edition of the @entity36			0
the group of 17 experts found no reason to change any other section of the guidelines			0
according to the report , " there is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a @entity46 goal of less than 150/90 and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90			1
" however , there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal , or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal , so the panel recommends a @entity46 of less than 140/90 for those groups based on expert opinion			2

panel of experts publish *findings* in @entity36
conclusion : people 60 and older might be able to handle higher blood pressure readings
traditionally , systolic number goal in that group is below 140
now , they are saying people the number can be below 150 in that age group
