@entity0 -- @entity4 probably died after he rapidly injected himself with a dose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on top of a large dose of sedatives he swallowed when dr. @entity11 was away , the defense 's propofol expert testified friday			1
the prosecution theory of how @entity4 died requires " an incredible coincidence of circumstances " using a " befuddling " iv drip configuration and an " irrational " assumption about how @entity11 injected sedatives , dr. @entity12 testified			1
@entity12 , the last defense witness in @entity11 's involuntary manslaughter trial , challenged the assumptions used by prosecution anesthesia expert dr. @entity21 to conclude that @entity4 's death was caused by an infusion of the surgical anesthetic propofol set up by @entity11			1
deputy district attorney @entity26 will take the weekend to confer with @entity21 before beginning his cross-examination of @entity12 on monday morning			2
closing arguments could be heard as soon as tuesday in the trial that started a month ago , depending on how long the prosecution takes with its questioning of @entity12 and if it chooses to recall @entity21 in rebuttal			1
the defense theory is that a desperate @entity4 , fearing that his comeback concerts could be canceled unless he found elusive sleep , self - administered propofol that @entity11 was trying to wean him off of			1
it contends that @entity4 also swallowed eight lorazepam tablets while @entity11 was not watching			0
@entity21 conceded last week that it was possible that @entity4 , not @entity11 , could have been the one to open the @entity40 to a fatal pace , but prosecutors contend that it would make no difference in @entity11 's guilt			2
@entity11 is responsible for @entity4 's death even if he did not give him the final and fatal dose , because he was criminally reckless in using the surgical anesthetic to help @entity4 sleep without proper precautions , the prosecution contends			2
@entity12 testified friday that it is his opinion @entity4 died after he injected himself with a 25 - milligram dose of propofol between 11:30 a.m. and noon june 25 , 2009			1
testimony and phone records indicated it was about noon that @entity11 realized @entity4 was not breathing			0
@entity12 theorized that @entity4 could have " pushed " the drug into an catheter in his leg using a syringe over a 15 - to 30 - second period , much faster than a doctor would have done			2
" i believe it could potentially have lethal consequences , " @entity12 testified			0
@entity12 also concluded that @entity4 swallowed a large dose of lorazepam several hours earlier , which would have left " a very high concentration " of the sedative in his body			2
" so you 've got drugs that have additive or even synergistic effects , and i think the combination effect would be very profound , " @entity12 said			0
@entity21 , who testified over an 11 - day span for the prosecution , concluded the " only scenario " that fits the scientific evidence -- mainly the drug levels found in @entity4 's blood after his death -- is that @entity4 was on an iv drip of propofol for three hours before his death			1
@entity12 , however , testified friday that with such a flow of propofol , @entity4 would have been " sleepy but arousable but breathing spontaneously			2
" it would not have killed him , he said			0
the 100 - milliliter propofol bottle prosecutors believe @entity11 used was empty when investigators found it , leading @entity21 to conclude that the last drops entered @entity4 's body just as his heart stopped beating			1
@entity12 called it " an incredible coincidence of circumstances " that the bottle would empty exactly when @entity4 died			1
the defense expert also questioned the prosecution contention that @entity11 placed the propofol bottle into an empty saline bag with an opening cut into it to suspend it from the iv stand next to @entity4 's bed			1
it would have been more logical for @entity11 to use a plastic suspension tab built onto the bottle , a routine practice			0
" it 's befuddling to me , because anyone picking up the bottle would naturally gravitate for pulling up the little hanger , " @entity12 said			2
" why would you go to all the hassle ? " hanging the bottle inside a bag also would not work because if @entity4 " rolled over and moved his leg , it would easily come out of the bag , " @entity12 said			0
the suspension tab on the propofol bottle had not been activated , both sides agreed			0
investigators who recovered the bottle and an opened bag testified they found them together , but they did not photograph it			0
@entity12 also questioned @entity21 's computer model conclusion that @entity11 gave @entity4 at least nine four - milligram injections of the sedative lorazepam at regular intervals from 1:30 to 5 a.m. the day he died			1
those " enormous " sedative doses alone would have put anyone to sleep and possibly killed them , @entity12 said			0
he said it would be " irrational " for a doctor to sit at @entity4 's bedside and repeatedly injected the sedatives to a patient in very deep sedation , as @entity21 's theory implies			1
friday 's court session , which lasted only three hours , was attended by @entity4 's father , @entity142 , sister @entity143 and brother @entity144			0
brother @entity146 's daughter , @entity147 , and @entity144 's son , @entity144 , also sat in court			0
@entity149 , who was a childhood friend of @entity4 's , and her husband , @entity150 were also in court friday .			0
