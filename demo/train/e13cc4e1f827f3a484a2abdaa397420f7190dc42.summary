@entity0 , @entity1 -- with the pump reading $ 4.29 a gallon , many of the gas station 's patrons are more than a little grumpy			1
but , one by one , they are approached by @entity8			0
sen. @entity9 is looking to turn @entity1 from red to blue in november			1
" excuse me , sir : are you registered to vote , and if so is it at your current address ? " she asks			0
she is polite and persistent , approaching more than two dozen customers during an hour or so at a gas station in @entity0 , @entity1 , a blue - collar community in southern @entity1 not far from the @entity20 border			1
of those she approaches , most say they are already registered , several say they are not , but not interested			0
three , though , stop and answer the questions as @entity8 fills out the state 's registration form and then hands it over for the new applicant to sign			2
another handful of sen. @entity9 volunteers work the lot , while a dozen more go door to door in @entity0 , part of a major grassroots effort aimed at turning one of the most reliably @entity37 states in presidential politics from red to blue			1
" i think we can			0
i really do , " @entity8 told us during a quick break from her efforts			0
" we have enough people dedicated to the campaign and enough people who want to see some change , so i think we will			2
" the fact that @entity1 even makes the list of battleground states is itself stunning			1
@entity51 won the state with 57 percent in 2000 and 60 percent in 2004			0
the last time @entity1 backed a @entity53 for president was @entity55 44 years ago			1
@entity9 's chances here could rest on the aggressive voter registration and identification effort			1
when @entity9 campaign volunteers register a voter , they also add them to the @entity9 database , and maintain contact with the voter			1
voter registration is nonpartisan , so there is no way of knowing for sure how many of the new voters -- and those who have erased any eligibility questions by updating their addresses -- are @entity72			1
but @entity73 secretary of state @entity73 , the state 's chief elections officer , said sen. @entity76 's campaign had better take notice			1
" they have a fight here in @entity1 and it is real , " @entity73 said			1
the numbers are dramatic : in 2004 , 2.5 million ballots were cast for president in @entity1			2
and in that entire cycle , the state received some 565,000 new and updated registrations			0
this year , the number is already in excess of 562,000 and given the recent spike in activity by campaigns and other organizations , @entity73 tells @entity2 he expects to hit a record 750,000 by the state 's october 6 registration deadline			1
" i will say that this is the first time i have ever seen a @entity72 presidential campaign this engaged in this state			1
usually @entity1 is no. 1 for the red states on election night when it comes to president , " @entity73 told @entity2 in an interview in his state @entity103 office in @entity105			1
while @entity9 allies are upbeat , to travel the state is to find proof that to turn @entity1 blue will be a difficult challenge			1
its farm communities and small towns lean conservative			0
in @entity120 , for example , president @entity51 carried 75 percent of the vote four years ago			0
it is a town of about 11,000 and home of the @entity125 health care and pharmaceutical supply company			0
@entity127 takes visible pride in the fourth - generation family enterprise , and says in his view @entity76 is more in tune with his needs as a small businessman , and with his views of the proper role of government in issues like health care reform			0
his take is significant : though he is a registered @entity37 , @entity127 was not a @entity51 fan and voted @entity72 for president in 2000 and 2004			2
this year , he says experience matters and @entity76 is far more ready in his view			0
he also rejects the frequent @entity9 attempts to link @entity76 to @entity51			2
" when you look a the resumes between @entity76 and sen. @entity9 ... sen. @entity76 is a lot more experienced , " @entity127 said in an interview in his office filled with memorabilia of a business that stretches back generations			2
of @entity76 he says , " he has never stood by the rules of the @entity37			0
he has always voted the way he believes			0
he tells people what they need to hear not always the most popular thing			0
" in @entity0 , too , there is plenty of evidence that @entity9 faces long odds here			2
as volunteers went door to door in a blue - collar neighborhood sunday for nearly an hour , they came across just one voter who promised to support the @entity72 nominee			2
one said he was a definite @entity76 voter , and several others said they were undecided , and accepted literature from the volunteers .			0
