-- fact : @entity2 love to curse			1
we , the people , use profanity every day			1
some will deny this reality , but those people are [ expletive ] kidding themselves			2
cursing is in our movies , tv shows , books and magazines			2
it 's also a big part of our daily conversations -- especially when we get passionate about something			0
however , for some bizarre reason , we demand that our elected officials not speak like the rest of us			0
we condemn them for even the slightest bit of swearing in public			0
opinion : @entity24 swearing ? no way ! for example , about a week ago , house speaker @entity26 was rebuked for using these words when speaking to @entity31 @entity30 members : " let 's call bulls --- bulls --- " president @entity34 raised more than a few eyebrows when he stated in a 2010 television interview that he wanted to know " whose ass to kick " to get the cleanup of the @entity41 oil spill moving faster			1
and vice president @entity42 came under fire for saying to president @entity34 during the signing ceremony of the health care law : " this is a big f --- - deal ! " we need to stop being so hypocritical in holding our politicians to a ridiculously prudish standard of communication			1
if we get worked up about an issue , we would n't just use the @entity52 to explain how we really feel -- we 'd be adding some @entity53			0
but we have neutered our politicians ' intensity and passion by limiting their choice of words			2
and then we wonder why so many of our elected officials -- and especially our presidential candidates -- seem so bland and hard to relate to			1
i 'm not saying elected officials should be dropping the " f - bomb " when talking to schoolchildren , but why not allow them to show more emotions ? even ceo recruiters now recognize that the use of profanity by corporate executives is acceptable because it is a mark of " authenticity " and " commitment			1
" hence , i offer a proposal that will hopefully provide us a glimpse of our presidential candidates at their most raw : a debate between president @entity34 and @entity77 on @entity78 so that they can use all the profanity they feel is necessary to convey their views			1
this debate format benefits both voters and the candidates			1
for voters , it will enable us to truly assess a candidate 's commitment to an issue			0
let 's be brutally honest , what showcases more sincerity ? " read my lips , no new taxes , " or , " read my lips , no [ expletive ] taxes			0
i 'm not [ expletive ] kidding ! " plus we can see how our presidential candidates would respond to a barrage of criticism , which is a test of character			1
how would @entity77 respond to president @entity34 calling him : " the biggest [ expletive ] flip - flopper in political history ? " would @entity77 just stand there , smiling sheepishly , or would he respond by channeling @entity103 and calling @entity34 : " the worst [ expletive ] president in @entity2 [ expletive ] history ! " the two candidates should support this proposed debate since it will give them a much needed chance to show @entity2 their unfiltered , human side -- something both @entity34 and @entity77 clearly need to work on			1
i understand that some people object vehemently to any kind of vulgarity			0
indeed , just this monday , residents in @entity115 , @entity116 , voted to issue a $ 20 fine to anyone who curses in public			0
and earlier this year , the @entity119 in @entity120 voted to ban council members from using dirty words in public meetings			0
to those who think profanity undermines the decorum of the presidency , you may have missed the details in your college history class			2
numerous presidents on both sides of the political aisle have been famous for their use of foul language , including @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and the king of cursing : @entity143			0
( at least on his private @entity30 tapes			0
) i 'm not suggesting that using cuss words at a presidential debate will help end our nation 's problems			1
but it might allow us to see our candidates at their most authentic self			2
and it will get us more interested and engaged in our democratic process			0
plus it will probably be the highest rated and the most quoted presidential debate in the history of our country			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			2
