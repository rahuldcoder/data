@entity0 -- certain groups of die - hard fans are protective of the characters they hold on a pedestal			0
" @entity11 " has its trekkies and " @entity10 " has the @entity9 religion			0
@entity12 has the @entity13 , scholars of the canon of books and short stories written by author sir @entity18			1
many @entity13 are members of the invitation - only literary society , the @entity19			1
group members have historically been critical of on - screen adaptations of their beloved consulting detective and his faithful sidekick , dr. @entity23			2
while they , by nature of their adoration , saw flaws in the @entity30 " @entity12 , " which opened in theaters friday , the consensus among these experts was that the film is a fun -- and even occasionally faithful -- romp through sherlock lore that the author himself would have enjoyed			1
" i liked it a lot more than i thought i would , " said @entity39 , a @entity40 magistrate judge			0
" what i particularly liked was the @entity45 relationship			0
the movie really showed @entity23 as a trusted companion to @entity12 , coming to @entity12 ' aid in times of need			1
the @entity23 of the books is a military man who played rugby and sports in college			2
he is observant on his own and @entity12 wants him around , not as a bumbling fool but as a trusted aide			2
" @entity23 has historically been portrayed in films as a bumbling sidekick , most famously by @entity60 actor @entity59 in a series of films from the 1940s			0
but director @entity30 's imagining of @entity23 is as the quick - footed , sharpshooting contemporary of @entity12 , with a rapier - sharp wit that can match the detective in the tongue - lashing department			1
" the movie did an excellent job in portraying the relationship between the two			0
the actors work well together , as did @entity12 and @entity23			1
the movie shows @entity23 as intelligent , able to be a good assistant ; @entity23 , the doctor , concerned about his friend 's well - being ; and it shows his reasonable frustration with his friend 's often thoughtless ways , " said @entity75 , a @entity19 since 1981 and co-author of " dining with @entity12			1
" @entity85 editor @entity84 founded the @entity19 in 1934			0
the group has included mystery writers @entity87 and @entity89 and science fiction writer @entity90			0
honorary members have included presidents @entity92 and @entity94			0
the plot of the new @entity12 movie , starring @entity97 , as @entity12 and @entity98 as @entity23 , is n't based on an actual @entity18 story			1
the action centers on ritualistic murders and black magic , all leading to a case that has all of @entity104 in danger			0
@entity39 saw " @entity12 " at an early screening of the film on tuesday in @entity0 with a dozen other @entity13			1
@entity39 has been a member of the @entity19 for 37 years , but has been a lover of the @entity12 detective stories since he was in junior high			1
" certain lines of dialogue were lifted the from the books , which we as @entity13 enjoyed			1
they got laughs from the 13 folks in the theater who were familiar with the stories , while everyone else was quiet			0
other than that , it was all made up except for bringing in certain character names and the supporting characters , " @entity39 noted			0
because they are so familiar with the entire canon of four novels and 56 short stories written by @entity18 , @entity13 naturally nitpicked some minor details			1
for instance , in this film , @entity23 introduces his fiancee , @entity133 , to @entity12 for the first time			1
" but we know @entity23 met @entity133 because she came to @entity12 for help in ' @entity137			2
' @entity12 already knew her , " @entity39 explained			0
and @entity12 ' love interest in the film , @entity138 , the con woman played by @entity139 , was in only one of @entity18 's stories , " a scandal in @entity145			1
" " while she was called an adventuress in the story , she was not a criminal by any means , as she is portrayed in this movie , " @entity39 said			0
@entity18 himself would have appreciated the newest on - screen display of his hero , says @entity154 , a @entity19 and retired appeals court judge			2
" @entity18 was not without a sense of humor and might have been amused by this film			2
he did n't care enough about @entity12 to insist on canonical accuracy , " @entity75 said			0
" when @entity162 , working on a @entity12 play , asked @entity18 if it was ok for @entity12 to marry , @entity18 is said to have replied , ' you may marry him , or murder him , or do anything you like to him			2
' " so if this portrayal is a combination of @entity12 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , " he added , " it just rolls along with the times and with the current film genre dominated by brilliant , spectacular special effects , explosions , violence , and more explosions			2

@entity13 are serious @entity12 fans ; many belong to the @entity19
consensus by experts is that sir @entity18 would have enjoyed new film
@entity13 nitpicked some film details because they *'re* so familiar with the books
