-- it 's the festival that launched @entity2 and popularized @entity3			1
so even if you 've never heard of the @entity6 ( it 's short for " @entity8 , " but if you want to be completely beyond hip , you can call it " @entity11 by " ) , your geek - tuned ears should perk up for some big tech news this week as this conference gets under way in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the @entity17 , apps , social media and tech start - ups have traditionally been the themes of this conference , which kicks off friday			1
in addition to being a launchpad for new sites and apps , however , @entity6 is all about big ideas in technology : where are we going , why , and how will we get there ? here 's our best stab at the ideas and trends that will pick up steam this year at @entity8			1
of course , all predictions are subject to change			2
and before we get there , a shameless plug : check our @entity8 blog for continuous coverage from @entity15			1
also follow @ cnntech , @ markmilian , @ jdsutter and @ griggsbrandon on @entity3 for nano - sized updates			1
' second - screen ' apps smartphones and the internet have rewired our brains to the point that paying attention to one thing at a time seems way too boring			2
cue the rise of smartphone and tablet apps designed to provide a " second - screen " experience while you 're watching television			0
it 's common knowledge that people tweet their way through the @entity67 and use @entity68 to discuss their favorite sitcoms in real time			0
but a host of apps are emerging to take these second - screen experiences to a new level			0
the " @entity77 " app for the @entity67 , for example , let @entity79 users choose which video feeds they wanted to watch			0
instead of focusing on the red carpet , for example , viewers could choose to hang with the paparazzi or in the celebrity champagne room			0
others are trying to sync their apps to live tv programming , using the microphones on tablets and smartphones			0
if your gadget listens to the tv while you watch , it can offer up quizzes , trivia and ads that are tied to what 's going on in the show at that very moment			0
localized group texting texting ? yes , texting -- but with a 2011 twist			0
if @entity68 and @entity3 were all about expanding a person 's online social network , think of group texting as an effort to rein things back in			1
an app called @entity109 -- already a @entity111 darling with tech bloggers -- integrates with @entity2 to let you have private text message chats with all of your friends who are close by			1
another , @entity116 , which was recently acquired by @entity68 , lets users start private text message conversations with small groups of friends			0
extreme use case : you 're throwing a last - minute party , but your apartment is n't large enough to host all 2,000 of your @entity3 - follower friends			2
beyond @entity68 continuing with this trend of @entity68 not being the end - all - be - all of social networking , expect @entity128 social networks and apps to get plenty of buzz at @entity8			2
none of these are likely to try to unseat @entity68 as the world 's dominant online social network , but some are worthy supplements			0
@entity138 , a photo - sharing app , is one hot example			0
it lets users apply all kinds of retro - looking , hipster filters to their smartphone photos and then share them instantly on @entity3 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity68 and @entity2			1
other social networky apps and sites focus on other features @entity68 either lacks or has n't mastered just yet : @entity152 focuses on answering questions ; path is designed for groups of 50 friends or fewer ; and @entity157 is a social network that 's fixated completely on the idea of foodie restaurant pics			2
taming the internet the internet is a crazy - overwhelming place			0
as @entity166 writes in the @entity167 , the personal computer " has become one of the most distracting machines ever invented			0
" expect at least a few web gurus at @entity8 to push the idea of " content curation , " meaning they 're out to answer this question : how can we make interesting and relevant information rise to the top of the internet , where users can access it quickly and without stress , rather than forcing them to swim through an ocean of @entity182 tweets just to find what they are looking for ? @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity68 and the like obviously have a hand in this			2
but some up - and - comers -- a la @entity188 -- may dominate this space at @entity8			2
is technology making us happier ? traditionally , @entity8 has been a clubhouse for the digital utopian crowd -- the bike - riding , glasses - wearing , cardigan - snuggling folk who think technology is saving the world , or is going to really soon			1
but , based on a the @entity8 panel list , expect this year 's festival to also give rise to a healthy bit of skepticism about what tech is doing to us			1
are smartphones making us scattered ? is @entity68 actually improving friendship ? does any useful info come across @entity3 ? as these technologies go from the stuff of early adopters to mass - market phenomena , look for the tech elite to start asking these kinds of questions and providing some solutions -- probably by using more technology .			1

the @entity8 festival starts friday
the @entity15 , @entity16 , event focuses on big ideas in technology
