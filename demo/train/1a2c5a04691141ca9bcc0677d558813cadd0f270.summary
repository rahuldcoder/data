sgt. @entity0 , a former @entity1 prisoner , on thursday wrapped up a two - day interview with an @entity4 investigating officer to discuss his disappearance in @entity6 five years ago			1
after disappearing from his post in june 2009 , the soldier , now 28 , spent five years in the hands of @entity1 militants			1
@entity0 's civilian attorney was present for the interviews			1
the investigation is ongoing , @entity4 spokesman @entity13 said			0
bergdahl attorney @entity15 described wednesday 's portion of questioning as both long and productive			2
" he answered every question that was put to him , " @entity15 said wednesday about his client			2
" i think it was helpful , personally , to sgt. @entity0 to be able to tell his story , you know , to a person in a position of responsibility without a lot of sort of intermediation by third parties			0
" after he was released in may in exchange for five senior @entity1 members held by the @entity35 military , @entity0 underwent counseling and medical care at a hospital in @entity39 , where he is now back on regular duty at @entity41			1
the news of @entity0 's freedom initially was met with jubilation , but the mood quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity			1
some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war			0
an @entity4 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official who was briefed on the report			0
the @entity4 has no definitive finding that @entity0 deserted because that would require knowing his intent , something officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity35 military official recently told @entity67			1
@entity0 works at the headquarters of @entity69 in @entity70			0
he is with a unit responsible for homeland defense , civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as @entity76 , @entity77 and the @entity78			0
he will eventually be given a position commensurate with his current rank of sergeant , the @entity4 said last month			0
@entity0 was a private first class when he was captured , and the @entity4 extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity			2
unless he requests an extension , the investigating officer has until mid-august to complete the probe ; a report would be issued about a month later			0
a grateful @entity0 ' understands that his life has been saved , ' lawyer says @entity0 returns to regular duty			1
