-- earlier this week , @entity2 police arrested four people suspected of selling heroin to actor @entity5 , who later died from a heroin overdose			1
but the police have n't yet connected them to the drugs that killed @entity5			1
assuming law enforcement does -- and they might because the actor 's telephone number was found on the cell phone belonging to one of the suspects -- can those suspects be held responsible for @entity5 's death ? the simple answer is no. but that does n't mean whoever sold heroin to @entity5 would be exempt from a heap of trouble			1
in @entity2 , homicide is defined as " conduct which causes the death of a person			2
" but not all homicides are the same			0
homicide is defined in several " grades , " ranging from criminally negligent homicide to manslaughter to actual murder			2
all share one basic requirement : intent to cause death or , at least , death arising from grossly negligent or reckless conduct			2
in layman 's terms , that means you either have to mean to kill someone , or know there 's a risk of death and do n't care about it			1
by all accounts , the people who police believe sold heroin to @entity5 were ordinary drug dealers plying their illicit trade			1
they may not have cared who they sold to			0
they may not have cared that @entity5 had a history of drug and alcohol problems			2
and they may not have cared that they were feeding demons that had taken hold of @entity5			2
but it 's also unlikely that those alleged dealers intended or believed that anyone , including @entity5 , would die using their product			1
prosecutors also generally do n't hold drug peddlers responsible for the consequences of their dealing , so it 's unlikely that lawyers from the @entity70 's office believed the dealers did			2
the people who police accuse of selling heroin to @entity5 could not even be charged with felony murder -- that is , a death happening during the course of committing another offense -- because @entity2 's felony murder law only applies to robbery , burglary , rape and similar violent crimes			1
still , those suspects could face serious legal problems			0
police found 350 glassine bags of heroin at the time of their arrest , which , if found to belong to the suspects , strongly suggests they intended to sell them			1
after all , that amount of smack is a lot for personal use			0
so , at the very least , a seller who supplied heroin to someone who overdosed could be charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree because he or she " knowingly and unlawfully " possessed heroin " with intent to sell it			0
" that crime is punishable by up to 8â … “ to 25 years			0
if police link them to the heroin that killed @entity5 , they also could be charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree because they " knowingly and unlawfully " sold heroin			1
that crime also is punishable by up to 8â … “ to 25 years			0
these penalties are , of course , the maximum sentences that could be imposed			0
if convicted of those crimes , though , those alleged dealers will surely spend time behind bars			0
both statutes also carry mandatory minimum sentences of one to three years			0
the police in @entity2 have already made examples out of the dealers suspected of selling heroin to @entity5			1
they spent enormous resources to quickly hunt them down			1
for better or worse , it 's doubtful that that level of effort was expended for anyone else who died of a drug overdose in @entity2 in the past several years			1
and there were plenty of them -- 541 in 2010 , 630 in 2011 and 730 in 2012			0
now it 's up to the prosecutors in @entity2			0
if they , too , want to make examples of suspected dealers , ample tools exist to put them behind bars for a very long time			0
it 's just that they wo n't be locked up on homicide charges			2
legally speaking , it was @entity5 who was responsible for his own death , even if drug dealers sold him the means to that end			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers : if suspects sold heroin to @entity5 , can they be held for his death ? not likely
writers : " homicide " means you meant to kill , or know there 's a risk of death and do n't care
in @entity5 's case , police spent huge resources to hunt down the suspects , they say
writers : it 's doubtful any of the *hundreds* who overdose each year will get that attention
