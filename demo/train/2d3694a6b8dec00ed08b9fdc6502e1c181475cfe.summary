-- @entity2 's @entity1 battled long and hard to make it to the @entity4 but he may wish he had n't following one of the most humiliating defeats of his career			1
it came against a @entity9 who was a mixture of majestic , imperious and brutal as he battered the home favorite 6 - 0 6 - 1			1
with @entity13 having won earlier on thursday , @entity9 came into the match knowing he had already made the semifinals -- and that freedom allowed a performance of flair and firepower			1
fifty - six minutes later , he had another exquisite win to reflect upon , a result that sent the @entity22 through to the last four			1
" i am clearly very happy to have played a good match , " @entity9 said on court			2
" i knew i was qualified so i went into the match more relaxed			0
it 's not the way i thought it was going to go			2
" the @entity29 almost won without dropping a game , only for @entity1 to salvage a morsel of pride in front of the @entity35 crowd by winning the 12th game of the match			1
having been just two points away from the first ' double bagel ' of his career , his appearance on the scoreboard brought up one of the biggest cheers of the night			0
but despite some shaking of heads from the locals in the @entity35 crowd , most left feeling they had watched a masterclass from one of the game 's greatest practitioners			0
" i can say i 'm disappointed in my level but if i played well , he would probably still have won anyway , " said @entity1 afterwards			2
" he played exceptionally well			0
" " it was a tough night			0
i 've lost ( grand ) slam finals and stuff , which has been very tough , but in terms of the way the match went , it was not ideal from my side of the court			0
" as he hinted , this was an understatement			0
the 17 - time grand slam champion needed just 23 minutes to reach set point , and he wrapped up the set for the loss of just eight points			2
winning the set qualified @entity13 for the semis , with the debutant having won 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 against @entity77 , who replaced @entity78 after the @entity79 pulled out with injury			1
it also eliminated @entity1 , who had needed to win in straight sets , from the competition			1
the @entity84 kept on losing games -- the seventh , eighth , ninth , tenth , eleventh -- in one of his most humbling experiences and his worst defeat since losing 6 - 1 6 - 0 to @entity91 in 2007			1
he would not have heard the advice the watching @entity93 gave to @entity95 television after the first set , but @entity1 may take some solace from the @entity100 coach 's words should he ever hear them			2
" there are some matches where we feel it is not our day , " said the @entity102			0
" sometimes a bad defeat is the beginning of many , many victories and hopefully next season will be great for @entity1			2
" @entity1 is one of the ' @entity111 ' but @entity9 , who can still finish the year as world no. 1 , put the two - time grand slam winner in his place			1
" it was good fun , " @entity9 told @entity95 television later			2
incredibly , the world no. 2 only got 39 % of his first serves in but he won all 14 points when he did			0
he has now reached the semifinals of the tournament for a twelfth time , so equaling the record of @entity1 's former coach @entity126 , as the 33 - year - old seeks a seventh @entity4 title			1
he is also in contention to finish the year as world no. 1 but he needs @entity131 to provide a major upset by stopping @entity91 in both players ' final @entity135 match on friday			0
@entity137 gains @entity9 's victory in straight sets continued the theme of the finals but the introduction of @entity77 resulted in the tournament 's first three - setter			1
the gritty @entity145 , who had practicing at the @entity146 as the first reserve , came in after @entity78 revealed he suffered a slight tear in his thigh when losing to @entity1 on tuesday			1
" i would be unfair to fans if i was to go out and play a mediocre match , " said the big - serving @entity79			0
" if i was to step on court , i could lose up to 6 - 8 weeks			1
that was a significant factor in my decision			0
" @entity13 , who lost this year 's @entity156 final , only found out shortly before walking on court that he would n't be playing @entity78			1
" it was really difficult to make this adjustment ( to face @entity77 ) , " said the @entity22			2
" they told me one hour before the match			0
" he took a while to settle , losing the first set but then fighting back in a performance where he hit 41 winners			0
@entity135 concludes on friday , with @entity166 also in action against @entity168 , who has lost both his games so far .			0
