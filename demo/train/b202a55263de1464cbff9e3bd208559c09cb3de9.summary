@entity0 -- the nation 's new chief intelligence officer delivered the annual threat assessment to the @entity5 on thursday , but his first topic was the economy			2
@entity8 said the worldwide effects of the economic crisis could lead to instability in governments			1
" the primary near - term security concern of the @entity16 is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical implications , " said @entity8 , who was approved last month as the director of national intelligence for president @entity14			1
@entity8 said the worldwide effects of the economic crisis -- from countries cutting back on their defense obligations to their mishandling of humanitarian issues -- could lead to instability in governments			1
such instability could help foster terrorist movements and activities , @entity8 said			1
" @entity30 is probably our greatest threat , " @entity8 said in prepared remarks released before he spoke to the committee			0
" the longer it takes for the recovery to begin , the greater the likelihood of serious damage to @entity16 strategic interests			0
" in his first appearance before @entity37 in his new post , @entity8 addressed topics ranging from cyber-terrorism to @entity41			0
asked by committee member sen. @entity42 , @entity43 , about the possibility of a cyber-terrorism attack on the nation 's power - grid system , @entity8 said that " a couple of years ago , ( it would have been ) a piece of cake			0
" changes and security upgrades in the system have reduced the possibility of a debilitating attack on the power system , @entity8 said			0
but " a very skilled attack by a group that knew what it was doing could cause us some problems , so there 's work still to be done there , " he said			0
extremist @entity64 groups still pose the biggest threat for terrorist attacks , but there has been " notable progress " in turning @entity64 opinion against such groups , including @entity41 , he said			1
" because of the pressure we and our allies have put on @entity41 's core leadership in @entity75 and the continued decline of @entity41 's most prominent regional affiliate in @entity78 , @entity41 today is less capable and effective than it was a year ago , " he added			0
regarding @entity80 's nuclear - development capabilities , @entity8 said that nation " is clearly developing all the components of nuclear material			1
" he estimated that @entity80 could produce a nuclear weapon by 2015			2
the @entity16 and other @entity86 nations believe @entity80 is pursuing a nuclear weapons program , but @entity80 says it is developing nuclear capability to produce energy			2
international pressure will be the main factor in getting @entity80 to drop any nuclear military aspirations , @entity8 said			1
" whether they ( @entity80 ) take it all the way to developing nuclear arms and becoming a nuclear power -- i do n't think it 's a done deal either way , " he said			2
but he added that getting @entity80 to stay away from nuclear military development will take a concerted international effort			1
" it 's not going to be like falling off a log , " he said .			0
