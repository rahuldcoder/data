( @entity1 's sister , @entity104 , also did well , later playing @entity105 in the @entity107 film " @entity105			1

glamour to spare it was n't until the groundbreaking " @entity67 " ( 1955 ) , also starring @entity130 and @entity131 , that she broke through into mature roles			1
the film featured @entity1 as the girlfriend of @entity130 's angst - ridden @entity67 in the role that made @entity130 a generational symbol			1
@entity1 was nominated for a best supporting actress @entity63 for her performance			1
but it was two 1961 films , the film version of the @entity144 smash " @entity68 " and the romantic tragedy " @entity146 , " that made her a top - tier movie star			1
in " @entity68 , " a version of " @entity150 " set among @entity152 's gang culture , @entity1 played @entity153 , the ill - fated heroine			1
though her singing voice was dubbed , her performance earned her good reviews in what became one of the most lauded movies of all time			0
" @entity146 " was no slouch , either ; for her performance opposite @entity162 , @entity1 picked up an @entity63 nomination for best actress			1
@entity1 had glamour to spare ; she was often touted , along with @entity169 and @entity170 , as one of the most beautiful actresses in @entity42			1

) she was named " @entity207 " by theater owners in 1963 and appeared in a series of popular films , including " @entity204 " ( 1962 ) , " @entity205 " ( 1963 ) and " @entity206 " ( 1965 )			2
though she turned down some challenging roles , including one in " @entity209 , " she bounced back with the wife - swapping comedy " @entity69 " ( 1969 ) , for which she earned a reputed $ 3 million ( thanks to shrewdly taking a cut of the profits )			2
however , except for a handful of roles , " @entity69 " also marked the end of a chapter in @entity1 's film career			1
she divorced @entity188 in 1972 and , having reconciled with @entity34 , remarried him later that year			0

troubled production , mysterious end " @entity46 " earned coverage not only for @entity1 's casting -- it was just her third theatrical movie since " @entity69 " -- but also for its technological trappings			1
the director , @entity243 , was renowned for his special - effects work on " 2001 : @entity246 " and " @entity247 , " and the movie was being shot in a special format			2
but " @entity46 " was plagued by production troubles , and rumors started circulating about @entity1 and @entity50 's relationship , as @entity252 notes in its writeup of the film			1
@entity34 , who visited the @entity256 set during a break from his tv series " @entity259 to @entity259 , " had suspicions			0
" the bell was n't exactly clanging , but i was aware that i did n't have her full attention , " he wrote in his 2008 memoir			0
" she was more involved with the movie than she was with her family , and the thought occurred to me that @entity1 was being emotionally unfaithful			1
" filming continued in @entity42 , and during the @entity271 holiday , @entity34 and @entity1 invited @entity50 to relax on their boat , @entity274 , named for " @entity146			2
" the rest is lost in the murky water off the @entity10 coast on november 29 , 1981 , when @entity1 died			1
at her funeral , her pallbearers included @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284			0
the aftermath affected lives well away from the boat			0

@entity313 , the " @entity314 " star , calls @entity1 her " idol			1
" @entity1 herself was blunt about her impact			2
" let 's face it , acting is not important			2
i know they 're not going to send my latest movie up in a time capsule , " she once said			2
what she desired , apparently , was more out of life			0
some time before her death she gave an interview and was asked if she was satisfied			0
after all , she had two children , a terrific husband , fame , money and beauty			0
what more could she want ? she did n't hesitate : " i want yesterday			0
