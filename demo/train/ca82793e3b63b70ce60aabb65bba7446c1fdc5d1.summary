( @entity9 ) -- @entity23 majors getting tired of @entity24 and @entity25 will soon be able to turn to @entity6 's libraries for a poet of different kind altogether : @entity17			1
@entity6 is in the midst of processing , preserving and archiving 1,500 audio tapes recorded in @entity17 's @entity32 headquarters from 1988 through 2000 -- a collection that includes recordings of everything from celebrations after militant actions to religious sermons to , yes , @entity17 's poetry			1
the university has already digitized 335 of the tapes and will have the rest of the project completed in a few years , @entity6 spokesman @entity40 said			2
once the archiving is finished , the entire collection will be available to researchers and students			1
" the library 's duty is to ensure the long - term preservation and access to these and other materials for decades and centuries to come , and for future generations of scholars , " @entity40 said			0
the tapes took a roundabout route to @entity59 , @entity60			0
in december 2001 @entity17 and his cohorts fled his @entity21 compound , leaving behind hundreds of audiotapes of gatherings , speeches and sermons that would be unearthed by @entity8 in the ensuing weeks			2
the network turned over the tapes to the @entity68 , which decided to release the tapes after concluding that the recordings did not contain any sensitive intelligence			2
@entity71 , director of the @entity72 , obtained the tapes with the intention of preserving and cataloging them			0
@entity71 , a professor of anthropology and sociology , alerted his colleague @entity77 , an assistant professor of religious studies at the @entity79 , of the tapes ' availability for research purposes			0
but @entity71 subsequently determined that the tapes , having been tossed around and kept in a damp and dusty environment , were in fragile condition and required treatment			0
he said he thought they would be accessible to a wider range of people at a large research university -- particularly one with a strong interest in @entity92 collections , such as @entity6			2
in 2005 , he offered the audiotapes to the @entity94 , and later that year they made the trek from @entity96 , @entity97			0
@entity98 , head of collection development for @entity6 libraries , said that while the original audiotapes are being kept in a @entity6 library shelving facility in nearby @entity103 , @entity60 , researchers , including those without a @entity6 @entity106 , are welcome to use @entity6 's digital archive to access the tapes that have already been restored and processed			1
" anybody who registers to use @entity6 's resources can have access to the digital recordings , " he said			1
@entity40 said researchers can listen to the digital files in the original @entity115 on a secure laptop in the manuscripts and @entity118 reading room			0
for now , @entity77 is the sole researcher studying the tapes			0
@entity77 , who has access to the original tapes but also uses copies , said the tapes are helping him to investigate the role that language ideology and poetry play in contemporary @entity128 reform in the @entity92			2
@entity77 , who over the past three years has been translating and transcribing the tapes , said his research will be compiled into a book that will seek to explain the development of @entity17 's militant movement with respect to the role of language in @entity136 and @entity128 culture			1
" the collection represents the most important database on @entity17 's intellectual formation that is available to the public , " @entity77 wrote in an e-mail			1
@entity77 said @entity144 scholarship and the media have focused specifically on @entity17 's public statements surrounding september 11 and on rare occasions have revisited earlier statements that he made about the @entity149			1
the cassettes in the collection , in contrast , offer recordings from as far back as the late 1980s in which @entity17 can be heard opining on issues such as fighting the @entity155 , which invaded @entity32 in 1978			1
the cassettes include " moving personal narratives of martyrdom " from members of a group that in time would develop a more rational public persona , @entity77 said			0
the @entity162 has reported that one of the tapes includes a recording of notorious @entity167 - born cleric @entity166 preaching to jihad recruits by comparing frying eggs to holy war			2
despite the tapes ' high - profile content and recent coverage in major news outlets such as the @entity162 and the @entity177 , many @entity6 history and political science professors interviewed for this article , including those who specialize in the @entity92 , said they were unaware of the recordings ' residence in @entity6 's libraries			1
" this is the first time i have heard of them , " political science professor @entity182 said			0
more than 200 speakers are featured in the audiotape collection , with 20 audiotapes featuring @entity17 's voice .			1
