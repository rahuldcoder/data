-- @entity2 legend @entity1 has just " one big regret " -- his portrayal in an award winning film about his arch rival -- the late , great @entity8			1
four - time world champion @entity1 battled the @entity9 for title supremacy while they both drove for @entity11 with their rivalry reaching its peak in the finale to the 1989 and 1990 seasons so much so that incidents on the first corner of races at @entity20 in @entity21 saw the pair force each other off the road			1
@entity1 was the beneficiary in 1989 after @entity8 , who was able to carry on , was controversially disqualified to give the @entity24 the world championship			1
twelve months on , @entity8 's ruthless move on @entity1 , who had quit @entity11 to drive for @entity28 , gave him the crown in a reversal of fortunes and left the men at odds			1
@entity1 , who won his final world title in 1993 , had retired by the time @entity8 was killed at @entity35 in the @entity36 of 1994			1
fateful weekend no one has died in f1 racing since that fateful weekend and it provided the producers of the movie with a chilling conclusion which left many film goers in tears as they left cinemas			1
but @entity1 , who co-operated on the award winning film " @entity8 " , is unhappy that his subsequent reconciliation with @entity8 is not featured			1
" the only regret that i have in my career is to see this kind of film that we are having on @entity8 , " he told @entity0 in an exclusive interview for @entity50			1
" you need to tell everything right , correct , and you need to accept that you can have some qualities , some faults and one can not be white and the other black			0
" i am very disappointed about that because it would have been good at my age to have shown to the people , to the world , that it was a little bit different			0
" but for me , inside me , i know what happened , i know the story , i know how @entity8 was just before his accident after i retired , i keep that for me			2
" senna scriptwriter @entity69 defended @entity1 's portrayal in the film but admitted it was " very , very diffficult to compress those 10 years ( of the @entity2 legend 's career ) into 100 minutes			1
" he told @entity0 : " @entity1 ( @entity75 ) was very kind in giving us time and we put seven examples of reconciliation between him and @entity8 at the end of the film			1
" biggest regret @entity69 also revealed that they had tried their best to insert a video clip of a lap by @entity8 in which he drove the @entity35 track and did a commentary for @entity24 tv station @entity89 ( for whom @entity1 was broadcasting ) saying ' " to my friend , @entity1			1
" but the clip was muffled and unusable in the context of the end of the film , he claimed			0
in a doubly tragic weekend for @entity2 back in 1994 at that @entity35 race , @entity97 driver @entity96 had been killed in qualifying on the saturday			0
@entity8 drove in the race with a small @entity97 flag in his race suit , which he was going to wave to honor @entity96 , at the finish to show the unity of @entity2			2
" if we omitted something , it was this more than anything else			0
and we tried to get it in , but the footage was n't there , " @entity69 said			0
" @entity112 rivalries , who did what to whom , who was disqualified , who won a trophy - all of that pales into utter insignificance in the context of the bigger story			0
" @entity8 is not a film about a sporting rivalry , because we would have called it ' @entity8 vs @entity75 ' and started it later and ended it earlier , if it was			2
the rivalry was an important element in our story - but it was just one of many			0
" @entity1 is still intensely proud of the era which saw the pair dominate f1 racing			2
" today if you say @entity1 you say @entity8			1
it is part of the @entity2 history and in my opinion is maybe the best years			0
" different characters in a recent poll by @entity0 , @entity1 was mentioned in dispatches by viewers in our quest to find the greatest @entity2 driver of all time , with @entity8 and @entity146 maestro @entity145 acknowledged as the best of their eras			1
@entity1 believes that he and @entity8 were unwittingly the victims of their own success and did not receive the protection they deserved from the media and sponsors			1
" we were very much exposed , " said the @entity24			0
" we had a lot of people who were very interested , very motivated to have this kind of story			0
" we did not realize that at the time			0
we just wanted to win but we had different characters and a different way of thinking and racing			0
" despite the obvious dangers , @entity1 would not swap his experiences with those who make up the modern day @entity2 grid			2
" if you are racing like today with almost no risk and you can continue until you are 44 or 45 years old like @entity172 ( @entity173 ) , for sure it is tempting			0
" you need to remember that there was a very bad period when you went out on a sunday morning and say what 's going to happen today ? " am i going to be able to come back because we had very bad accidents , very regularly			0
" i would have loved to have driven in this period , working with the engineers on the technical side , but no , i prefer my period			0
" but @entity1 remains deeply unhappy about the balance of the @entity8 film and in particular the closing moments			1
greatest drivers " what i regret is that our story was more than sport , it was also human , " he told @entity0			0
for all that , @entity69 is convinced they did the story justice in a balanced and fair way " look at their body language after @entity8 's last win at @entity198 in ' 93 -- warm , all smiles , a tap on the knee			2
then the coming together on the podium			0
then @entity1 's disbelief after the accident			1
" then @entity1 , clearly in shock , drinking a cup of water			2
@entity1 is the last and , in a way , the most important person to cross himself at @entity8 's coffin - the sadness all over his face , the badge on his lapel clearly marked ' a ' ( a for ' @entity214 ' , friend ) - and @entity1 is the main pallbearer			1
" finally , we end by saying that @entity1 is a trustee of the foundation			2
