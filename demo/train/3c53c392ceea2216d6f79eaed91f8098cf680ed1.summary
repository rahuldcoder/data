-- it has been eight years since people in my state of @entity5 got a chance to debate the meaning of the @entity8 in front of the nation , and the comments posted on @entity0 and other news web sites suggest our passion over the topic has not dimmed			2
if governor @entity16 wants his fellow @entity17 to think deeply about " how our history has led to our present , " then his declaration of april as @entity19 has accomplished this goal , if not exactly in the manner he intended			1
the problem with the celebration of @entity19 , however , goes far beyond @entity16 's " mistake " in not discussing the centrality of slavery in the @entity8 in his original proclamation			1
@entity30 " history " means more than the four years during which @entity5 and other states fought a war to form a separate country called the @entity30			1
it refers to the many uses of @entity30 symbols and evocations of @entity30 history in the almost century - and - a - half since @entity41 as well			1
this long history offers nothing to memorialize			0
former @entity30 soldiers quickly formed the @entity45 after the war to attack @entity48 officials and the black and white @entity49 who were trying to run the state , and they sometimes displayed @entity30 symbols as part of their work			1
after congressional hearings shut down the @entity45 , copycat organizations continued to make use of @entity30 symbols as they engaged in acts of political terrorism			1
former @entity59 openly supported and participated in what many white @entity60 called the " redemption " of the region , the reassertion of their control over state and local governments as @entity48 ended			0
in the 1870s and 1880s , the decoration of @entity30 graves with flowers and flags and celebratory speeches and parades increasingly signaled a commitment to what came to be called the " @entity77 , " a decidedly partisan and self - consciously politicized account of the @entity8			2
though many supporters of secession believed during the @entity8 that they were fighting against other @entity81 over the issue of slavery , amateur and professional historians , many with ties to the @entity30 worked to rewrite this history as a noble fight for states rights and a celebration of the sacrifice of @entity30 soldiers			1
what members of the sons of the @entity30 offer today as the " true " history of the region has its roots in this effort			0
by the end of the 19th century , organizations like the @entity30 veterans and the @entity103 organized public acts of commemoration and the celebration of the " honor " of former @entity59			0
members of these organizations actively used their version of history to support the disfranchisement of african - americans and the expansion of a white supremacist social order grounded in segregation			0
across the region , @entity119 segregation and @entity30 commemoration expanded hand in hand , as the @entity77 version of the @entity60 past justified the contemporary elimination of black rights			0
ireporter : gov. mcdonnell " wrong and right " on the issue when more subtle displays of @entity30 symbols and history were not enough , white @entity60 violently attacked and murdered african - americans , sometimes publicly before large crowds			1
@entity135 sometimes brandished @entity30 symbols			2
in the early 20th century , monuments to @entity30 soldiers appeared on courthouse lawns across the @entity60 and on the grounds of southern state capitols , marking these public spaces as the property of the white people who celebrated this " @entity30 " version of the past			0
by the 1920s , a revived @entity45 made the @entity30 battle flag their second-most important symbol , after the fiery cross , as they once again used violence and threats of violence to uphold white supremacy			0
with the @entity156 's victory in @entity157 and the success of the @entity159 , some white @entity60 revived the use of @entity30 versions of the past and @entity30 symbols in their fight against the civil rights movement and integration			1
crowds who attacked civil rights activists sometimes carried @entity30 flags as civil rights supporters carried @entity171 flags and sang " @entity172 " to counter these @entity30 symbols			2
called the " country club @entity45 " because of its public condemnation of violence , the @entity173 also used @entity30 versions of the past in its opposition to @entity171 equality			0
today , @entity30 history is as much about 1965 and the @entity181 as it is about 1865 and @entity183 's surrender			0
the long history of the ways @entity30 symbols have been used and @entity30 history has been evoked to support racist violence and @entity171 - @entity171 oppression haunts gov. @entity16 's declaration of @entity19			1
@entity30 history can not be separated from the issue at the center of the @entity8 , slavery			2
but it also can not be separated from the history of segregation , massive resistance , and the fight against the civil rights movement			0
historically , @entity30 versions of the past and @entity30 symbols have meant opposition to equal rights for all @entity81			1
in officially recognizing @entity19 , gov. @entity16 is asking @entity17 to join together in celebration of this history of white supremacy			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0
