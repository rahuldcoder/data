@entity0 -- @entity3 met with me this week about the launch of her new fragrance , @entity7 , but as is often the case with this pop mega-star , it is hard to determine what is marketing , what is performance and what is her reality			1
" fame has a very interesting prospect with dangerous encounters around the corner ...			2
. fame is ultimately about the cycles of desire and how to do away with them or manage them well , " the 26 - year - old superstar said			1
" @entity26 can create a very cruel space for you if you do n't know how to manage it			0
" one thing you are sure of -- she is passionate			0
unlike other celebrities who license their name to use on products other people make , @entity3 was heavily involved in the entire process , she says , including the idea of making the actual liquid black -- a perfume first			1
at first , her collaborators tried to talk her out of the dark tint " so you do n't have to explain to everyone how it wo n't get on your clothing , " she recalled			0
" and i said , ` i do n't want to do it unless it 's black '			2
" she is certainly someone who knows how to walk the fine line between shock value and mass appeal -- as when i asked about what she wanted from @entity7 's scent			1
" i wanted it to smell slutty , to be totally honest , " she said			1
" i do n't think that women need to smell interesting			2
i have an interesting mind but i want to smell like a slut ... i mean it in a lovely way like the way your husband makes you feel when you 've had a really long day and he knows exactly what to say to you to make you feel sexy			2
" does she think of herself as a businesswomen ? " well , i guess we 'll find out , " she said			0
more : before she was @entity3 : the unseen photos the young performer is certainly in the black : @entity71 estimates @entity3 earned $ 52 million between may 2011 and may 2012 -- a drop from the $ 90 million she earned the year before , the magazine reported			1
but @entity71 expects that figure to balloon next year , as she launched her 2012 - 2013 " @entity75 " world tour in late april with more than 100 concerts planned			1
will that passion translate into commercial success for the perfume ? some fans are turned off when their favorite artists hawk products , but as @entity3 quipped during our interview , " i already am a product			1
" prices for the @entity7 products range from $ 19 to $ 79 for a 100 milliliter bottle , and the line also include soap , shower gel and body lotion			1
she joins a long list of celebrities who have launched their own perfume or cologne lines , from @entity97 and @entity98 to @entity99 and @entity100			1
" the most exciting thing about this fragrance is that is was collaboration between myself and two lifelong friends of mine , incredible photographers and creators , " she said			0
" @entity108 shot the ad campaign the amazing images for the fragrance and @entity111 designed the bottle with me			0
it 's been an amazing time for me			0
i 've been enjoying myself because i get to work with people i really love and respect and give something back to the fans			0
" we really spent a lot of time creating this for you because we love you and we appreciate that you love the aesthetic that we created through our music and tv performances , " she added			0
@entity3 has dismissed the idea of a fashion line in the past , saying the @entity131 , the creative team behind often controversial couture , " was not a commodity , not something to be sold			1
" but that may be shifting			0
when i asked her if this experience has made her open to the idea of other products she coyly responded , " anything is possible			0
" as for the woman herself : she was punctual , polite , fabulously turned out but i can honestly say by the end i had no more insight on @entity3 the person , than i did at the start			2
and i suspect that is just how @entity3 likes it			2
she is in it for the long haul and very much in control of every aspect of her fame .			0
