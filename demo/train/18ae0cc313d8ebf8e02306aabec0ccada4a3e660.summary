@entity0 -- the " @entity6 , " a wall that looms 37 feet over left field in @entity9 , may just about sum up the kind of pride @entity4 have for their city : it 's old , immense and helps guard against cheap shots			1
so when two bombs tore through the crowds at the @entity17 last week , the city 's response was so instinctive and full - throated that it made even the most ardent of @entity19 fans a little proud			1
" we pride ourselves on this family - community way of being , " said @entity20 , a @entity21 resident tending bar downtown			1
" any person who attempts to disrupt that , there 's no chance we 're not going to take it personally			0
" natives often tout their @entity0 bona fides when traveling outside the city , added resident @entity32			1
and when there 's trouble , " everybody helps out			0
" that played out in the heart of the city last week as first responders rushed to help scores hurt in the smoldering aftermath of a rare terrorist attack on @entity43 soil			2
the april 15 bombings killed three people and injured more than 170			0
from backpacks to ' flash - bangs ' : @entity0 's week of terror but by nearly all accounts , it could have been much worse			1
" moments like these , terrible as they are , do n't show our weakness ; they show our strength , " said @entity52 district attorney @entity51			2
days later , @entity0 transformed into a virtual ghost town as authorities fanned out across the region and honed in on one of two surviving bombing suspects in a quiet suburb roughly 10 miles west of the attack			1
how to help in @entity0 when the lockdown was lifted and the suspect in custody , residents poured out onto city streets to cheer on police and chant , " we love @entity0 ! " " it 's in your blood , " said @entity72 , a @entity73 native who has since moved to @entity74 , @entity75			1
" even my grandmother 's a @entity80 fan			0
" a week later : @entity0 honors victims " i 've lived all across the country and there 's nothing like it , " she added			2
the city , @entity88 's biggest , anchors a half - ring of suburbs that make it the nation 's 10th - largest metropolitan area			2
but @entity0 is the quintessential little big town , with a deep reservoir of history that includes often embellished tales of @entity97 and @entity98			1
its brick - bound patchwork of ethnic enclaves and blue - collar neighborhoods give the place both a sense of community and a do n't - mess - with - us air			2
still , last week 's attacks likely will leave an indelible impression on its time - honored traditions			1
on the third monday of april every year dating back to 1897 , @entity73 has celebrated @entity109 with the running of the @entity17			0
" here 's what you usually do on marathon monday , " explained 30 - year - old @entity111			0
" you go the @entity80 game to catch a good buzz , and then you head over to the finish line to see everyone cross			0
" " now , it 's a day of sadness and remembering			0
" while much of the region has since edged back to normal , a six - block area downtown remains a barricaded crime scene			0
but this week an ailing mayor @entity125 , who 's been a fixture in office for nearly two decades , defiantly stood from his wheelchair to announce plans to reopen @entity130			0
" it 's time to move this city forward , " he said			1
did one brother brainwash the other ?			0

@entity0 *bartender* : " we pride ourselves on this family - community way of being "
*prosecutor* : the bombing exposed @entity0 's strength , not weakness
@entity145 in history and *diversity* , @entity0 is the quintessential little big town
the attack left an indelible mark , but mayor says it 's " time to move this city forward "
