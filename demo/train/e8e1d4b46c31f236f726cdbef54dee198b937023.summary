-- for african business leaders who study and further their training overseas , returning to the continent can be even tougher			1
it can be hard for them to commit to returning to the even smaller economies of their home countries , says @entity9 , @entity10 's ceo for @entity11			2
" you get expatriate @entity13 and @entity14 with the best will in the world wanting to come back , " @entity9 told @entity0			0
" but they find themselves employed [ in @entity19 or the @entity20 ] and think , ' i 'm one man , i 'm one woman , and i have an opportunity here			0
' " there is a steady flow of @entity25 leaving their homeland to study overseas			0
students from @entity11 are the most mobile in the world , according to the @entity30 ( @entity30 )			1
as many as one in three higher education students in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity36 study abroad according to a @entity30 report			1
by comparison , one out of every 250 @entity39 students studies overseas			0
@entity42 @entity41 , an it manager studying for an mba at @entity45 's @entity44 , said there just are n't that many opportunities back home			1
while @entity42 has seen a surge in corporate opportunities for talented businessmen and women , " the economy is just too small to accommodate the kind of jobs they want to do , " @entity41 told @entity0			2
even when young @entity25 want to combat the so - called " brain drain , " it can be difficult for them to find the right opportunities back home			1
" this group of people , despite how important they are to the continent , are having the darndest time connecting to opportunities back home , " said @entity61			1
he 's the president of @entity67 , an alliance of @entity42 students and young professionals studying at top academic institutions around the world			1
right now , there 's no systematic way for these young leaders to go home and be effective , said @entity61 , who started @entity76 with a @entity78 classmate at @entity79 in the @entity20 three years ago			2
" because many of them still have this perception of the ' dark continent , ' that nothing is going on , they do n't even try , " he said			0
communication and recruitment challenges are some of the biggest obstacles facing young business leaders who want to return home , according to @entity61			1
@entity91 organizers hear @entity42 graduates expressing particular frustration about a lack of information on how to find the jobs that suit their backgrounds			2
for example , @entity61 said , @entity99 is investing heavily in @entity11 , which is creating several opportunities			2
yet you have @entity42 students in @entity104 or @entity105 who really do n't know how they can be effective back home			1
" someone who is @entity42 and is educated in @entity99 or @entity104 and speaks fluent @entity99 should n't be wondering what he or she can do back home , " he said			1
fledgling organizations like @entity76 , which connect young workers with businesses seeking to invest or expand in their countries of origin , are helping to tackle this problem			1
@entity76 has helped launch entrepreneurship programs in @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity13 as well as a microfinance scheme in @entity121			0
but it 's been an uphill battle getting these programs off the ground			0
" there 's this barrier of folks kind of looking down on the youth and not thinking that they 're ready or prepared to be of value -- this is huge , because in countries where youth is encouraged and supported , its easier for people to start things , " @entity61 said			0
it is n't just creating and finding opportunities , but funding them as well , that can keep young executives from going home			0
a @entity143 higher education survey found that recent graduates interested in entrepreneurship felt they could n't turn their new ideas and skills into viable businesses in their countries of origin , due to an almost complete lack of venture capital			0
but the overall business climate is starting to change , as investors eye @entity11 's growth potential , and that could lead to more options for expatriates wanting to return home , @entity9 from @entity10 said			2
" the world has had a very big jolt , " he told @entity0			0
" suddenly the risk adjustment on returns from @entity11 is looking like a good opportunity			0

young @entity42 business leaders who study abroad find it difficult to connect to business opportunities back home
communication and recruitment challenges are some of the biggest obstacles
students from @entity11 are the most mobile in the world , according to @entity30
groups like the @entity67 try to connect young workers with businesses seeking to invest or expand in their countries of origin
