@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's recent financial growth has been as dizzying as the swirling dancers , colorful costumes and pulsating music that typify the industry 's films			1
@entity0 's once booming flamboyant @entity12 film industry is hit hard , as overseas investment dries up			1
foreign money has poured into @entity0 's flamboyant @entity12 film industry , which churns out more than 1,000 films each year			1
twice as many films as @entity18 -- and for a fraction of the cost			0
but a financial drama has arrived on the movie sets and production suites of @entity1 's largest city courtesy of the world economic downturn and a producer 's strike -- fewer films are being made ; less tickets are being sold and money is suddenly tight			1
" it 's become more difficult now to green light films ; to be able to think of developing films , " @entity33 of @entity34 who works as both a producer and a director told @entity2			1
" today you think twice how you 're going to be able to put that thing together before you commit any money to it			0
" it 's the new reality : money that was gushing into the market from abroad to finance films a year and a half ago is now just trickling in			1
production of @entity4 movies has only just resumed , having ground to a halt for seven weeks due to a producer 's strike			1
the strike is finally over , but money is still tight and this is affecting the number of films going into production			2
" the number of movie projects has come down by almost 30 percent , " @entity60 , a partner at business consultants @entity62 told @entity2			0
@entity60 heads @entity62 's media and entertainment division in @entity0 and looks at trends in the market			2
what 's more , after several years of fast - rising film revenues due to @entity1 's exploding middle classes who were willing to spend , @entity4 finds itself back on a budget			1

in some cases , accountants are actually on movie sets crunching numbers daily to make sure the budget is on target			2
" they are getting into daily audits , " @entity60 said			0
the thought of an accountant on set might make some producers shudder , but many believe the slowdown has done @entity4 a favor			1

" i think it 's a very good [ thing ]			0
" he currently has several in the works : an animated film in post-production called " @entity120 " and a gritty action - packed thriller " @entity123 , " named after the @entity0 street term for heroin			2
the slowdown has made @entity4 focus on making better , not more movies , according to @entity33 : " i do n't call it a credit crunch , i call it a credit correction			2
" i think what has happened is it 's corrected itself , because i think @entity4 or the @entity1 film industry was going absolutely crazy last year			1
