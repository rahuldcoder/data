@entity0 remembers standing at ground zero , feeling like a small speck amid mountains of debris			0
" everything was pulverized , " said @entity0 , a former @entity5 police officer and first - responder who provided security after the september 11 terror attacks			2
" it was nothing but dust			0
" for 20 days , during 14 - hour shifts , @entity0 breathed in countless chemicals ; he even ate meals on site as the dust hovered			2
most of that time , he did not wear a mask			0
in retrospect , he said , " we were ingesting whole buildings			0
" less than four years later , at age 46 , @entity0 was diagnosed with @entity24 oropharyngeal cancer			1
one tumor had formed in @entity0 ' throat and two on his lymph nodes			0
an ultrasound later revealed another tumor near his collarbone			0
" all four were malignant , " said @entity0 , who choked up as he recalled being diagnosed			2
" i asked , ' what 's my chances ? ' no one could give me an answer			0
" according to the most recent data from the @entity38 , there are nearly 3,000 cases of cancer among firefighters , police officers , contractors and civilians who worked or lived near the site of the attacks			1
a growing number are being diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer , but some -- including @entity0 -- are being denied insurance coverage because their cancers were diagnosed too soon after 9/11			1
the minimum latency period for oropharyngeal cancers -- in other words , the minimum time period required to prove a link between exposure to toxins at ground zero and a diagnosis of that type of cancer -- is four years			1
( absent this type of dramatic environmental exposure , oropharyngeal cancers in most cases take one or two decades to develop , although recent studies suggest that cases are being diagnosed at younger ages and more frequently			1
) @entity0 was diagnosed three years and 10 months after his work at ground zero , about eight weeks shy of eligibility for cancer coverage or compensation			1
" we got screwed , " he said			0
" they do n't know what the latency period should be ; four years may be right , or it may be wrong			1
" the @entity79 determined the latency periods for 58 cancers , including oropharyngeal , now covered under its @entity83			1
in a statement , the institute said it " selected minimum latencies informed by the available science " and that it " erred on the member - favorable side to avoid false negatives for coverage			2
" in documents outlining its process , the agency acknowledged that , for the most part , data in this area are scant			0
" at the time they came up with the latency period , there was nothing unreasonable about it , " said @entity98 , a partner at the @entity100 law firm in @entity5 , which is representing thousands of 9/11 responders , including @entity0			1
that is because it was not known what effects cancer would have on this population			2
but in the two years since latency for cancers was spelled out -- and many cases later -- @entity98 says , it has become " an inescapable fact that the latency period has to be wrong			1
" wrong , he says , because of the sheer number of oropharyngeal cancer cases he is seeing cross his desk			1
@entity98 , along with colleagues at another @entity5 law firm , represents about 7,500 people exposed to toxins while working at ground zero			0
he says 39 have been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer			1
about one - quarter of that group was denied coverage because of the four - year latency rule			1
to have so many cases of a rare cancer -- diagnosed in an unusually young population , according to data provided by @entity98 -- should , he says , spur a re-examination of the data by the @entity79			2
dr. @entity136 , chief medical officer of the @entity137 , says that oropharyngeal cancer in this population , absent risk factors like drinking , smoking or a human papillomavirus infection , is unusual			1
still , determining an accurate latency window is an exceedingly complex process			2
" four years is a group of people 's best guess ; it 's literally that , " said @entity136 , a practicing oncologist			0
" i do n't know of any animal models for cancers developed after sucking in that much soot and smoke ( from collapsed buildings ) , so people have to make a guess			0
" @entity136 added that four years is probably a fair -- perhaps even generous -- timeline for developing oropharyngeal cancer , even considering the unique circumstances surrounding 9/11			1
" i think ( the @entity79 ) made a terrible mistake , " said @entity160 , a first - responder diagnosed with @entity162 oropharyngeal cancer at age 44 , three years and five months after 9/11			1
like @entity0 , he was denied coverage because he was diagnosed too soon			2
" i 'm going to die knowing i got my cancer from 9/11			2
i do n't care what @entity79 says			0
" advocates for responders , including medical experts , say that they will petition the institute to amend its rules concerning coverage for oropharyngeal cancer			1
in a statement , the institute indicated that as new scientific information becomes available , it could modify minimum latencies for certain cancers			0
" this has to be a dynamic process where they look at what 's going on this community and say , ' maybe we need to change this , ' " @entity98 said			0
@entity160 and @entity0 have been in remission for several years , yet both remain hypervigilant about cancer , as it could one day reappear			2
compensation , they say , would provide some comfort that their families would be supported if they die			0
but it is less about money , @entity0 says , than about not being forgotten			0
" there is an abnormal amount of cancers amongst us that are n't in the general population , " he said			0
" this is something that has to be looked at			0

nearly 3,000 cases of 9/11 - related cancer among first responders and civilians
a growing number are being diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer
insurance coverage depends on latency period defined by @entity83
