their average monthly expenditures were previously between 10,000 pounds and 20,000 pounds a month , he said			0
he was more concerned about @entity10 's balance because it was higher , he said -- reaching about 40,000 pounds " on a regular basis			0
" the prosecutor asked why he did not raise the matter with @entity17 and @entity42 immediately , but @entity16 said he put it " on the back burner " because other matters were more pressing			2
" we were dealing with more corporate matters -- more serious corporate matters -- and mr. @entity5 and miss @entity4 normally did n't have time for what we thought were trivial matters , " @entity16 said			1
the sisters were expected to make purchases for the family on the company credit card , he said , as part of their job helping the couple with personal and work - related matters			1
he said they had a close relationship with @entity42 and @entity17 and regularly accompanied the family on holiday			2
after an investigation revealed the sisters ' alleged personal spending , @entity16 said he met with them in july 2012 to discuss the situation			0

however , it became clear there would not be time for @entity17 to take the stand before proceedings finished for the day			0
@entity17 is expected to testify friday			2
drugs use allegations @entity87 heard at a pretrial hearing for the sisters this week that @entity42 and @entity17 had a " culture of secrecy " around their marriage			1
in the hearing , the defense read an e-mail from @entity17 to @entity42 about the allegedly embezzled money , saying the assistants would " get off " because , he wrote , @entity42 was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and " allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked			1
" representatives for @entity42 declined to comment on the allegations , citing the ongoing court proceedings			1
the defense also read a statement from @entity17 saying he learned of @entity42 's alleged drug use in june , around the time the couple were photographed in a restaurant having an argument			1

@entity17 accepted a police caution for assault , and the couple announced they would divorce soon afterward			0
