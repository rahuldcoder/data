he argues his termination was unjust			0
" the knee - jerk reaction to terminate mr. @entity9 was not about whether ms. @entity13 chose to create and perpetuate a life - threatening situation			1
that is a clear and indisputable fact			0
" rather , the city 's decision was about appeasing certain members of the community who want to make this case about ms. @entity13 's age , the fact she is @entity24 , or the fact she is a woman			1
" none of those factors played a role in @entity9 's decision to use deadly force , " @entity26 , @entity9 's attorney , said in a statement sunday			1

" an officer asked her to put the handgun down , and when she would not , shots were fired			0

stem fired three times , and @entity46 was hit at least twice , he said			0
she was transported to a hospital , where she died			0
" police not only have a duty to protect themselves from imminent harm , but also innocent citizens who rely on them ' to protect and serve , ' " @entity9 's attorney said in his statement			1
the case eventually will be presented to a grand jury , which is standard procedure when dealing with officer - involved incidents , according to @entity59 , the city attorney			2
" i would expect people to be upset about this , a young police officer shooting a 93 - year - old lady , " @entity59 said			1
" i 'm upset about it			0
most of our citizens are upset , but at the same time , i do n't believe all the facts have come to the surface yet			0
