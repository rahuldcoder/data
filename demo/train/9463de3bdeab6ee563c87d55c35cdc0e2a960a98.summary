-- @entity1 can be depressingly long in @entity2 but when it comes to sports played in those chillier months , curling usually is n't the first choice for youngsters in the @entity8 nation			1
they would rather put on skates and dabble in ice hockey or go skiing , with the likes of @entity13 and @entity14 providing ample inspiration			0
the country has also produced legendary tennis players , such as @entity18 , and in @entity19 possesses one of football 's biggest talents in recent decades			0
@entity23 is glad , though , that he chose curling -- even if it is less glamorous and lucrative			1
he has mostly overcome his fiery temper and a troubling back injury to make history and end @entity29 's dominance in a sport dubbed " chess on ice			1
" and , at 28 , he is part of a younger generation with big ambitions			0
for @entity23 , his teammates and @entity2 , the timing is good since the @entity38 are a mere five months away			1
" we 're going into the biggest season of our careers and it 's going to be huge playing the @entity43 , " @entity23 told @entity0 's human to @entity40			1
" we 're one of the favorites to do good so it 's definitely going to be a different season for us leading up towards that			2
" as the men 's skip and team leader , @entity23 led @entity2 to victory at the 2013 world championships in april			1
he not only beat @entity29 's @entity54 -- another 28 - year - old -- in the gold - medal game but did so on @entity29 soil in @entity58			0
it snapped @entity29 's three - year stranglehold on men 's gold at the world championships and gave @entity2 its first men 's title since 2004			1
having also triumphed at the @entity67 championships last december in his hometown of @entity69 -- a small city located about 160 miles west of the @entity2 capital @entity72 -- @entity23 became the first skip to achieve that double in the same season			1
no wonder @entity2 is one of the favorites in @entity79			1
@entity23 has already visualized capturing gold at the @entity43			1
far from being a sign of cockiness , it provides him with motivation			0
" we know we can win and we truly believe in ourselves , " he said			0
" i think that 's one of the main things you need to be able to do going into the @entity43 -- if you want the medal , you need to be able to see yourself winning			2
" it 's always good to be the underdog and to not have anything to lose			0
it 's easier that way			0
but now that we 've come a bit further i think we 'll like the situation even more where we 're one of the favorites			2
" @entity23 decided to try curling after he watched the @entity2 women win bronze at the @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105			1
@entity106 did n't run in the family , as his father is a farmer and his mother is a teacher who instead liked figure skating			0
" i tried it in the local curling rink and i was struck right away , " said @entity23			1
the sport combines power with touch and strategy			0
controlling the 20 - kilogram stone while sliding is n't easy and placing it in a particular spot at the other end requires ample skill			0
despite the indoor venues , the weather outside can affect conditions inside			0
" you can go up to 90 % of your maximum pulse when sweeping and during a game we have to do that multiple times throughout that three - hour game , so it can be really exhausting , " said @entity23			2
" then the tournaments are long , the days are long , so you need to be quite fit to be among the best			0
" when you try it at first it 's so slippery , it 's way different than hockey and those sports			0
it 's so tough to find your balance at first but then when you do that it 's more about tactics and more about the skills			0
" to be amongst the top - 10 teams in the world , you definitely need to be good at chess to have a good strategy			2
" once it was apparent that he had a special talent , @entity23 focused solely on curling and devoted all of his time to his new passion			1
a world junior title followed and at the @entity155 in @entity156 , not far from @entity58 in @entity157 , @entity2 finished a respectable fourth under @entity23			1
the team now plays about 20 tournaments a season , enough to make a living			0
and if @entity23 stands highest on the podium in @entity164 next february , his finances will likely improve further given the endorsement opportunities a gold medal brings			1
@entity2 is the two - time defending champion among the women , but its men are seeking a maiden @entity43 triumph			1
" there 's not a lot of money in this sport but you can still go full time if you 're reaching towards the @entity43 and you get funding from the @entity43 association and stuff like that , " said @entity23			1
" for us it 's been full - time the last few years and building up to the @entity43			2
" although @entity23 's rise has been quick , it has n't been without struggles			2
he had back surgery in 2010 after being diagnosed with multiple herniated discs , and needed another operation after the problem flared up on the eve of the 2012 world championships in @entity192			1
he shared skip duties with @entity194 yet amid the turmoil @entity2 grabbed bronze in a tense win over @entity8 rival @entity198			1
" it 's been a long struggle for the whole team and for ( @entity204 ) especially , " @entity194 told reporters			0
@entity23 now says of the back issues : " i 'm feeling better			1
" his composure has gotten better , too , although it remains a work in progress			0
he openly admits to having acted like tennis bad boy @entity209 in the past , losing his cool when things were n't going his way			0
" over the years i 've calmed down quite a bit and try to be as good as i can towards all the people around me on the curling sheet or curling rink because i think it 's in the interest of the sport -- like golf , where you show respect to one another , " said @entity23			2
" even if you want to win you do n't want to show that disrespect to the other people around you so i try to calm myself down			0
but if we 're losing in a bad way i definitely ( have a ) temper			2
" however , @entity23 does n't often lose in a bad way nowadays .			2

@entity23 took up curling after watching @entity2 take bronze at the @entity103
@entity23 won a world junior title before *claiming* a @entity67 and world championship double
he has worked on his temper and has had to overcome a back injury that required surgery
@entity23 and teammates will be among the favorites at the @entity43 in @entity79 in february
