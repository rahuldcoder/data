@entity0 -- in another summer , when @entity3 was younger and insulated , she took a long train ride from her native @entity5 , @entity6 , down to @entity7 for a very important concert			1
excitement bubbled because of the marquee names -- @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14			2
famine was not a familiar term to @entity3 then but @entity17 , organized by @entity19 musician @entity18 to raise money and awareness of hunger in @entity23 , opened her eyes to human suffering			1
so much so that a few years later she left her stockbroker job in @entity28 to help shuttle aid supplies into war - ravaged @entity30			2
before she knew it , she was driving a truck into @entity34			2
she 's been in the aid business now for 18 long years , but @entity3 was shocked when she visited @entity36 and @entity23 in the last few weeks			1
shocked , even after previously seeing the suffering in @entity34 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
" i did n't think i 'd see any surprises , " she said at a forum thursday at @entity43 's @entity42 headquarters in @entity0			1
" i 've never seen anything like it in my life			2
" her first stop was the @entity50 refugee complex , where @entity43 has been operating for 20 years			1
the massive food shortages have swelled @entity50 's population to about 400,000			2
that 's the size of the city of @entity55			2
desperate , women have walked for 50 miles to reach @entity50			2
some started with three children but arrived with only one still alive			2
the lines are 15,000 - people long just to register for the camp			2
the @entity62 estimates that 600,000 children could die in the next few months in the region			0
think about it this way : if famine were declared in the @entity42 , that would translate to 3,000 or more children dying every day from lack of food and water			1
@entity73 : how you can help in an earthquake or tsunami , things are worst in the immediate aftermath			0
no matter what , aid workers can hope to look forward to things getting better , however measured			0
but famine is like a creeping monster -- this one first appeared on the horizon many months ago but largely went unnoticed by the world until it began devouring thousands of lives			1
burying a child : a mother 's unending grief @entity3 's colleague @entity91 , director of @entity43 's emergency programs , said that with the rainy season still a few months away , things will get worse before they get better			1
he showed a map thursday of the @entity96			1
the five regions of southern @entity98 , where the @entity62 has declared famine , appeared in dark brown			1
then he showed the projection for the next few months			0
the dark brown patch grows twice as large			0
high - res photos : desperation in @entity98 while @entity98 fares the worst largely because of internal conflict and insecurity , @entity23 , @entity36 , @entity104 and a sliver of @entity106 are also reeling in catastrophe			1
@entity3 and @entity91 visited areas in @entity23 that are teetering on famine but are still off the international radar			1
not many journalists visit these areas and the world sees little of what is happening there , @entity3 said			1
she ran across piles of animal carcasses and bones littering the parched landscape			0
it has not rained in the @entity124 region of @entity23 in nearly a year			1
" at first i did not connect the carcasses to starvation , " she said			0
but when she arrived at the clinics treating children reduced to skin and ribs , she realized they had no meat to eat			0
" this month , it 's cattle , " an elder cattle herder told @entity3			1
" next month , it 's the people			0
" at a stabilization center in @entity138 , @entity91 watched children curl up in their mothers ' arms and look vacantly into their faces			0
please save me , they said with their stares			0
@entity91 got back in his jeep , and cried			0
he , too , in all his 25 years as an aid worker , was struck by the enormity of the crisis			1
even for the hardiest aid worker , this was difficult beyond words			0
starvation is slow and painful			0
" it 's really pretty terrible , " he said			0
" these kids will die unless they get immediate assistance			0
" @entity3 and @entity91 -- who came down with typhoid fever on his plane journey back -- returned to @entity0 with a mission to raise awareness of the famine			1
they could not let down the people they had met who begged them to tell their tale			0
there is nothing man can do to avert the worst drought in 60 years			0
but part of the discussion at @entity173 focused on how the international community can help stabilize skyrocketing food prices by looking at agricultural production capacities and trade policies			0
food prices fuel hunger in @entity36 in @entity36 , for instance , the price of a 90 - kilogram bag of maize , which is the main food source for most @entity36 , soared from about $ 16 in june 2010 to about $ 44 in july 2011 -- an increase of 160 % , according to the @entity184			1
@entity91 and @entity3 appealed to the world for help in what the @entity62 has deemed the worst ongoing humanitarian crisis			1
@entity3 said donations for the @entity96 total only a fraction of what was collected after the earthquake in @entity39 or the tsunami in @entity194			1
musicians and actors have a lot of pull , she said			0
why not another celebrity event to draw the world together ? @entity62 @entity201 ban ki - moon spoke thursday with @entity11 frontman @entity202 on the need to mobilize international resources			2
the rock star leads @entity206 , which fights extreme poverty , and told @entity1 that people must act to prevent more suffering			2
" people seem to prefer watching people on the high streets of @entity7 fighting policemen rather than watching children of @entity98 fight for their lives , " @entity202 said			0
" people watch their stock values crumble while i think of our own sense of values tumbling because ( the famine ) will define who we are			2
" " this is outrageous , " he said			0
" this ca n't be happening			0
" relief groups urge action in @entity231 @entity3 is hoping the efforts of people like @entity202 will help bring relief to the 12 million people affected by the acute shortages of food			1
she recalled how the entire world stopped to watch @entity17 in 1985			1
the event raised hundreds of millions of dollars for @entity23 and gave her brand new global insight			1
" why not now ? we need that again , " she said			0
there are young people in the world 's richest nations , she said , who could be touched as she was all those years ago			2
maybe , they , too , would then be drawn to act .			0

two *longtime* @entity43 *staffers* have just returned from @entity23 and @entity36
they say they were taken aback by the enormity of the suffering
@entity3 was inspired by 1985 @entity17 concert to get involved
she says she hopes the world will come together again to help combat famine in @entity96
