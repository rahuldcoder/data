-- here 's one from the obvious file : there 's no " magic wand " that -- poof ! -- creates jobs in the @entity6 , or anywhere else			1
in response to my column this week on long - term unemployment , some of you commented that the president does n't have superpowers to create jobs for the rest of us			1
or you pointed out that he should be part in the process -- but job - creation is actually something @entity23 or business leaders should take on instead			1
i thought those were great points			2
here 's my favorite comment -- mostly because it uses the term " pea brain " ( and yes , it 's in reference to me , but you 've got ta love a nerdy insult , especially when it includes a vegetable ) : " are you so stupid that you think the president just waves his magic wand and jobs are created ? let me give you a lesson in government @entity38			1
maybe your pathetic conservative pea brain will be able to grasp one fact : the president proposes and @entity23 legislates			1
so it is the @entity23 that is keeping that poor woman unemployed			1
they have done nothing to aleviate ( sic ) her plight ... " the " poor woman " the commenter , who used the screen name " tom sellier , " referenced is @entity50 , an unemployed mom who invited me into her home tuesday to watch the @entity53			1
overall , @entity50 , who has been unemployed on and off for five years , did n't take much comfort from the speech			1
she 's more worried about keeping a roof over her head			2
some of the most cutting things @entity50 had to say focused on house speaker @entity64 , whose apparent indifference toward the @entity53 -- scowling , licking his lips , looking very " get me outta here " -- made her angry			2
her point of view , and i think there is some merit to this , is that president @entity73 wants to promote infrastructure projects and other " stimulus " efforts that would create jobs , but @entity78 are so focused on the deficit they wo n't consider spending money on that			1
she was n't thrilled with everything @entity73 said either			2
drafting public policy that will create jobs and put people back to work is a tricky thing			1
that 's part of the reason i argued the first and easiest thing we all can do to help the long - term unemployed is to treat them as equal humans			1
currently , they 're some of the most maligned people in our society			0
companies put out ads saying they only will consider employed candidates			0
recruiters toss their resumes before taking a look			0
generally , i think the national sentiment is that unemployed people must have done something wrong to end up jobless			1
as a person who 's been laid off before , i can tell you that 's not always the case			0
it 's unfair to give unemployed people less of a chance at getting back on their feet			1
if anything , i think they deserve more consideration			0
it 's the fair thing to do			0
other readers said getting a job is an individual 's responsibility			0
" i 've been unemployed and it sucks			2
but you do whatever you have to to get work you dig ditches , you wash dishes , empty trash , you may even have to move your home , " wrote mikemc58			2
" @entity135 is you have to think outside the box and get out of your comfort zone			0
wishes and dreams are n't going to do it			0
get off your butt hit the streets everyday asking , looking , volunteering , for a job			0
and listening to @entity73 drone on about how good the economy is useless , because as we all know , ' we ' who live in the real world know it 's not			0
@entity150 is not the answer , personal responsibility and self motivation is the key to finding new work			2
" that 's another fair point , although i think individual effort only goes so far when there are 3.4 unemployed workers for every job opening in the @entity6 in december , according to the @entity6 @entity162			2
and it 's important to empathize with people who become stuck in a cycle of hopelessness and depression the longer their unemployment continues			0
that 's not an easy cycle to break			0
one more thing to bring up about the comments : while many of you wrote in to ask how you can help long - term unemployed people get back on their feet , several of you attacked @entity50 -- criticizing her ownership of a tv , saying she should n't have cable if she does n't have a job ( she actually does n't have cable , but that 's beside the point ) and speculating about what type of cell phone she uses			1
what silliness , right ? and it speaks to the underlying problem here : we 're inclined to attack unemployed people -- to judge their financial situations and to speculate about what might have put them out of work			1
@entity50 , the woman i featured , told me that ending ignorance will help end unemployment			0
government and business leaders must help , too			0
but i think she 's right : a simple shift in attitude -- trading ignorance for empathy -- can and will make a huge difference			0
