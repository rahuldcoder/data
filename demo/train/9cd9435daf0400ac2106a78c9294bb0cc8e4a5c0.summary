@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity6 's inner circle showed possible signs of cracking friday , heavily armed forces loyal to the @entity1 leader continued pounding cities that were once some of the country 's most prosperous places			1
officials and analysts said the surge in firepower from the @entity1 government sends a message : @entity6 is determined to prevail , and defections of some of his high - profile allies are making him nervous			1
" you 're certainly getting evidence that there are a lot of tensions			0
... each person that leaves , that makes it a little scarier for the people that are still remaining			0
and you may , at some point , get a tipping effect , " said @entity31 , a professor of international affairs at @entity33			0
on thursday word emerged that @entity6 's pick for @entity40 ambassador had defected to @entity41 -- a day after @entity1 's foreign minister fled to @entity43 and told the government there that he had resigned			1
citing unnamed @entity48 government sources , the @entity46 newspaper reported friday that a senior adviser to one of @entity6 's sons was in @entity43 for secret talks with @entity48 officials			1
the adviser to @entity55 , @entity56 , told @entity2 earlier this week that he would be traveling to @entity43 for family reasons			2
calls placed to his mobile phone by @entity2 on friday were not answered			0
asked about the @entity46 report , a @entity48 @entity63 spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it			2
" we are not going to provide running commentary on our contacts with @entity1 officials , " the spokesman said			2
" in any contact that we do have , we make it clear that @entity6 has to go			0
" rebel fighters also said they remained determined to topple @entity6 's nearly 42 - year reign			1
but the battles over key cities are far from over			1
rebels massed on the outskirts of the government - controlled oil town of @entity80 , which has changed hands six times in six weeks under dramatically shifting circumstances in the country 's civil war			0
@entity86 , @entity1 's third largest city and the final rebel stronghold in the western part of the country , was under siege by @entity92 forces			1
badly damaged buildings lined streets covered with wreckage after weeks of urban combat			0
witnesses said most residents fled the downtown area after government forces positioned snipers on tall buildings and used tanks and artillery in the city center			0
clearly outgunned , opposition forces have pinned their hopes on more @entity109 airpower			1
" we want to bring a speedy end to this , " col. @entity110 , an opposition spokesman , told @entity2			0
" a strike is not a strike unless it kills			0
" @entity117 officials claim @entity6 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of @entity40 - sanctioned airstrikes			1
but the dictator 's forces still outnumber rebels by about 10 - to - 1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , @entity125 chairman adm. @entity124 told the @entity129 thursday			0
@entity117 defense secretary @entity130 , also speaking before the @entity131 , warned that the @entity1 rebels still need significant training and assistance			1
" it 's pretty much a pickup ballgame " right now , he said			0
@entity117 and @entity48 officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition			1
@entity130 reiterated the @entity141 administration 's promise that no @entity117 ground forces will be used in @entity1 , telling committee members that the rebels had indicated they did n't want such an intervention			1
but the @entity117 does have @entity147 personnel on the ground			0
@entity147 operatives have been in @entity1 working with rebel leaders to try to reverse gains by loyalist forces , a @entity117 intelligence source said			1
the @entity117 , insisting it is now fulfilling more of a support role in the coalition , shifted in that direction as @entity109 took sole command of air operations in @entity1			2
a @entity117 intelligence source said the @entity147 is operating in the country to help increase @entity117 " military and political understanding " of the situation			2
but officials leaving @entity1 may end up playing a more decisive role than troops or @entity147 agents on the ground			2
after defecting wednesday , former @entity1 foreign minister @entity170 was voluntarily speaking with officials in the @entity48 , @entity48 foreign secretary @entity169 said			1
@entity169 said @entity170 's departure from @entity1 provides evidence " that @entity6 's regime ... is fragmented , under pressure and crumbling from within			1
" @entity170 did not tell the @entity1 government he was planning to quit before he arrived in @entity48 , @entity1 government spokesman @entity176 said thursday			2
but @entity176 downplayed the defection itself , saying @entity170 was an old man in poor health who had not been able to handle the pressure of his job			0
on thursday an opposition leader and a relative said that the man @entity6 tapped as the country 's @entity40 envoy had defected to @entity41			2
former foreign minister @entity188 , who recently served as the president of the @entity190 , was to replace @entity191 as ambassador in @entity193			2
such defections are significant , but not as important as the departure of one of @entity6 's family members would be , according to @entity198 , a former @entity147 operative in the @entity199			1
" crack that clan and he 's done			0
those elite units will fall apart , the tribe will defect , and it will all be over , " @entity198 told @entity2 's @entity201			0
@entity2 's @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
