secretary of state @entity2 is postponing a visit to the @entity4 to give @entity6 efforts at negotiating a cease - fire between @entity8 and @entity9 a chance to take root , several senior @entity1 officials tell @entity12			1
@entity2 was to travel from @entity13 -- where he was negotiating a deal with @entity15 and world powers over @entity15 's nuclear program -- to @entity6 and @entity18 in the coming days to lay the groundwork for a possible cease - fire between the two sides			1
on monday , @entity6 called for a cease - fire to stop the bloodshed and to project the innocent			1
" @entity6 shall receive guarantees from both sides of their commitment to implement what has been agreed upon , and shall follow up on its implementation and engage with either side in the case of any action that impinges on its stability , " the @entity24 said in a statement			0
one official said the @entity1 wants to give @entity6 a chance to reassert itself as a power broker the @entity4 , as it did during the 2012 cease - fire			1
the @entity1 sees the election of president @entity41 as a positive development in terms of @entity6 playing a constructive role in the conflict , because @entity47 administration sources say that @entity49 nation now is viewed as less conciliatory towards @entity9 than it was under former president @entity50			0
@entity2 will allow a few days for diplomatic efforts to lay any groundwork , officials said , and is still prepared to either travel to the region if any cease - fire does not take hold , or to help support it if it does			1
@entity8 officials tell @entity12 their military operations have made inroads to degrade @entity9 ' capability , now see some potential in the @entity6 proposal , and are willing to test it and see if a cease - fire can be reached			1
by monday , the death toll from about a week of @entity8 airstrikes had reached 186 -- all of them @entity69 -- with at least 1,390 wounded , according to @entity69 health authorities			0
no @entity8 have been killed in the rocket attacks , though there have been some injuries			0
if a cease - fire takes hold on wednesday , the @entity6 have called for @entity8 and @entity69 delegations to travel to @entity78 for negotiations in the coming says			1
the cease - fire talks are not expected just to address just a cessation of hostilities and related security issues , but also the humanitarian situation and @entity69 concerns -- such as addressing re-opening the @entity88 border crossing between @entity6 and @entity89 , @entity69 fishing rights , salaries for @entity69 in @entity89 and the eventual disarmament of @entity89			1
the goal , officials from @entity6 , the @entity1 and @entity8 said , is to put the pieces in place to a cease - fire that endures and includes preventing @entity9 's inability to re-arm and continue rocket fire			1
@entity8 has made clear that it will only consider a cease - fire if the pieces are in place to make sure that it is a lasting and durable calm			2
the @entity6 cease - fire proposal calls for " @entity69 factions " to negotiate with @entity8			1
@entity1 , @entity6 and @entity8 officials say those factions are to include members of the @entity108 in an effort to empower president @entity110 as the legitimate representative of the @entity69 people			0
the officials say they do n't want @entity9 to be the ones gaining politically from a cease - fire , as it has in the past			2
senior @entity8 officials say the @entity6 proposal is being taken very seriously ; however , a @entity9 spokesman described it as a " joke			0
" " we did not receive this declared paper from the @entity6 ... which means it 's an initiative for the media			0
it 's not a political initiative , " said @entity126			0
speaking on @entity12 's " @entity129 with @entity130 , " he continued : " it 's not really an initiative			0
it 's not really an idea , what they are trying to do is to corner the @entity69 and to help the @entity8 more			0
" chief @entity69 negotiator @entity137 was more optimistic , saying he is hopeful that " we may see some real , real serious signs of a possible cease - fire in the next 12 - 24 hours			2
" " i know that some other leaders in @entity9 have said we are not closing any doors for any initiative for a cease - fire , " he said			2
president @entity47 monday welcomed @entity6 's proposal , saying he hoped it " will restore the calm that we 've been seeking			0
" one of the goals of the cease - fire is to address some of the issues surrounding the lack of @entity69 unity , with the ultimate goal of having the @entity108 be the ruling authority over @entity89			2
one complication is the regional rivalry between @entity6 and @entity18 , which has close ties with @entity9 and is looking to play a role negotiating a cease - fire			1
while @entity1 officials say they think that @entity18 could play a helpful role given their close ties to @entity9 , they need to balance that role carefully so as not to alienate others in the region , including @entity6 , who are wary of @entity18			2
@entity18 can also help pay @entity69 salaries , but the @entity1 officials say they do n't want @entity18 propping up @entity9 financially .			0
