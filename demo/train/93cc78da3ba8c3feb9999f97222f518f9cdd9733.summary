-- sometimes a filmmaker makes a documentary to have an impact on a national issue , and the finished product impacts him in profound and lasting ways as well			0
this is what happened to @entity10			1
the 33 - year - old @entity12 - winning journalist has written and directed a powerful film about the immigration debate , a broken system , the separation of families and his own life story			1
" documented " airs sunday , june 29 at 9 p.m. et on @entity0			1
@entity10 became " undocumented " without his consent			1
when he was 12 years old , his grandfather brought him to the @entity21 from the @entity22 illegally so that he could have a better life			0
the young man was n't privy to the scam until , at 16 , he went to the @entity26 for a driver 's license and his permanent residency card was rejected as bogus			2
from there it was one lie after another as @entity10 went to college and then in pursuit of a career			1
his grandfather may have started the fraud , but the young man became an accomplice			0
" his lies became my lies , " @entity10 told me , in recalling his grandfather			1
" i claimed to be a citizen to get a job			0
" @entity10 : undocumented and hiding in plain sight in fact , @entity10 got a whole string of jobs , writing for the @entity47 , the @entity48 , the @entity49 and the @entity50			1
in june 2011 , in a 4,600 - word essay for the @entity52 , he came out as an illegal immigrant			2
since 2012 , @entity10 and the nonprofit organization he founded called " @entity10 " have been battling the " i - word			1
" they pressure newspapers and media companies not to use the phrase " illegal immigrant			0
" as someone who has championed the rights of immigrants -- both legal and illegal -- since the early 1990s , against @entity65 and @entity66 alike , i have n't felt the need to fall in line			0
besides , many liberals who say " undocumented " ignore the fact that president @entity71 has deported 2 million whatever - you - call - them			2
judge : immigration courts dealing with death penalty cases in traffic court setting today , unable to work for a payroll check without a social security number , he supports himself through freelance writing and paid speeches , performing more than 200 speaking engagements in 45 states in the last three years			2
@entity10 learns as much from his audiences as they learn from him			1
not all of it is positive			0
" the level of misinformation is shocking , " @entity10 said			1
" i knew it was bad but i did n't know it was that bad			0
people do n't know we pay taxes , that many of us have been here for more than 10 years , that it is not a border issue , that this is not just a @entity102 and @entity104 issue			0
they do n't know a lot			0
" @entity10 is disillusioned with president @entity71 's refusal to use executive power to stop deportations , especially since the immigration debate is going nowhere			1
this week , @entity112 @entity66 rep. @entity111 , the leading champion for immigration reform in @entity114 , declared it a lost cause for the rest of the year and said that he would focus on pressuring @entity71 to use executive power			1
" there is no intellectual honesty and no sense of moral urgency , " @entity10 said about the immigration debate			1
more than 20 years ago , the plan was for @entity10 ' mother to follow him			1
but she could n't get out			0
and he has spent most of his life trying to overcome a sense of maternal abandonment			0
still , as we see in the film , the bond between a mother and her child is more powerful than borders			2
we get the impression that the first thing @entity10 would do if his status were ever regularized would be to board a plane to @entity138 to see the woman who amputated a part of herself so that her son could have a life with more hope and less misery			1
' i did n't know i was undocumented ' the timing of the film is perfect			1
today , as tens of thousands of children stream across the @entity21 - @entity104 border into the @entity150 from @entity151 -- children who , if the @entity153 gets its way , could be coming soon to a relocation center near you -- many @entity21 wonder how it is that parents could send their children off alone on a dangerous journey toward an uncertain future			0
a @entity163 friend , sympathetic to the parents , reminds me that at least now the kids have a future			0
it 's been done before , he said , during the @entity167 when parents snuck their kids out of @entity169			2
people were willing to never see their children again , as long as the little ones were delivered from evil			0
@entity10 reminds us all that -- far from being some sort of aberrant behavior -- it 's what we would expect parents to do			1
" i think of my mom , who to me , represents all the parents of the undocumented , who make the sacrifice to get a better life for their kids , " he said			0
" when i was a kid , and really until my mid- 20 's , i suffered from depression and i made the mistake of blaming my mother for not coming with me			0
" now @entity10 understands that his mother acted out of love			2
after all that he 's been through , he also understands -- better than most @entity21 -- the intricacies of the immigration issue			2
and thanks to this indispensable film , so can the rest of us .			0

the film " documented " airs on sunday , june 29 at 9 p.m. et on @entity0
