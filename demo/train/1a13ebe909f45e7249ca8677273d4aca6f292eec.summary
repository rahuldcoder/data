@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's best - known judge , @entity3 , refused to answer questions from a prosecutor as he took the stand tuesday in his trial on charges of abusing his judicial authority			1
@entity3 sat and listened in silence as lawyer @entity11 read out all his questions to put them into the court record			1
the case centers on @entity3 's investigation of human rights abuses under gen. @entity17 , the dictator who ruled @entity1 for four decades , until his death in 1975			1
a seven - judge panel at @entity1 's @entity20 tuesday rejected requests from both state prosecutors and @entity3 's defense to throw the case out , clearing the way for private prosecutors to press forward			1
@entity1 law allows for private prosecutions , and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against @entity3			1
@entity3 , however , did answer questions from his defense lawyer , @entity32 , explaining that his investigation started in december 2006 after people came forward with complaints about those still missing from the @entity17 era			1
@entity3 testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities			2
so he decided to investigate because he considered those to be " permanent crimes " which still affect their descendants , since the remains have never been found			0
he said he began to see evidence that there was a " systematic plan " against @entity17 's opponents , which he said included forced disappearances , illegal detentions and assassinations			2
about 20 supporters applauded the judge in a hallway of the courthouse before the trial began tuesday , while outside , dozens more demonstrated in his favor , some holding placards with just one word : justice			0
judges began hearing the @entity17 - era case last week , a week after a different seven - judge panel at the same court conducted another trial against @entity3 , for allegedly abusing his judicial authority in a high - profile financial corruption case known as @entity69			1
that trial lasted three days and a verdict is pending			0
@entity3 , 56 , was suspended from his post in 2010 , pending these trials			2
if convicted , he would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in @entity1			0
many observers said the second trial is the more important one against @entity3 , who became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former @entity81 dictator @entity80 , who was in a @entity83 hospital			2
@entity3 accused him of the murder of @entity1 in @entity81 and crimes of genocide			1
@entity88 of @entity89 was in the courtroom on tuesday along with other international observers and later said , " @entity3 showed today that his decision to take up the investigations of the crimes of the @entity17 era was fully supported by international law			1
" " but the spectacle of a judge as a criminal defendant , having to justify his investigation into torture , killings and ' disappearances , ' was itself an affront to principles of human rights and judicial independence , " @entity88 added			0
the private prosecution is led by a small civil servants union called @entity110 , or @entity111			1
it brought charges against @entity3 , saying he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved in @entity1 @entity115 , two years after @entity17 's death			1
" @entity115 unanimously approved the amnesty law			1
judge @entity3 takes a stance as if they 're crazy			2
what does he think ? that he 's better than them ? " said @entity121 , leader of @entity110			0
@entity121 denies critics ' charges that his group is a tiny far - right front , but he recently told @entity2 he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the @entity128			0
just before the trial began on tuesday , @entity121 told @entity2 outside the courtroom that he had heard the judges would deny the motion to stop the trial and instead proceed			0
" a first victory , " @entity121 said			0
@entity3 said in may 2010 , at the time of his suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the @entity139 , " i face this calmly , with the tranquility of knowing that i am innocent of these charges			1
" @entity17 's military uprising in 1936 triggered the three - year @entity144			2
the war ended when @entity17 's forces emerged victorious over @entity148 and leftist fighters			2
@entity17 's dictatorship continued until his death			2
mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed , including one this week in the southern @entity1 village of @entity154 , said @entity155 , from a group called @entity157			0
@entity155 said the excavations are being done with permission from the landowner , whether public or private , and with permission from local health authorities , who must ensure that the potential discovery of bones or other remains does not pose a current public health risk			0
just outside the courtroom before the proceedings began january 24 , @entity3 told @entity2 he was " okay " as he headed into this second trial			0
he talked with his lawyers and supporters , smiled broadly and appeared relaxed			0
@entity3 spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the @entity139 , which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases			1
he has investigated the @entity178 leader @entity177 , the @entity180 terrorist group @entity181 , and drug traffickers			0
at times in the past , @entity3 has been considered a darling of the @entity1 right or the @entity1 left , depending on the cases he was investigating			1
his critics say he is too flamboyant and grandstands in front of the cameras			0
since his suspension in 2010 , @entity3 has been working as a legal adviser outside of @entity1 on human rights cases and judicial issues , including in @entity196 .			0
