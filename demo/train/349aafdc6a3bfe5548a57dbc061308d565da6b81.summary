-- of all the arguments swirling around the legality of same - sex marriage , it 's clear that a major concern is , as always , the kids			2
supporters argue that same - sex parents need to provide their children with a stable and supportive family home , complete with the legal protections afforded heterosexual married couples			1
opponents claim that children raised by same - sex parents are wounded in some fundamental way by being denied the " normal " benefits of having both a mother and father at home			1
what is lost , remarkably , in both these arguments is the science that enabled families headed by same - sex couples to exist at all			1
until recently , families had to consist , at least at the outset , of a mommy and a daddy , each biologically necessary to bring children into being			2
even if the mother died in childbirth or the father disappeared shortly thereafter , the physiological basis of the nuclear family remained intact : one mother , one father , and a child conceived of their union			1
from this unvarying biological fact came millennia of social norms and structures			0
mothers stayed with their children to provide nourishment and nurture in the early days of infancy ; fathers stayed , generally , to ensure that their genetic offspring had some chance of reaching adulthood and sustaining the family line			0
@entity52 did n't count so much in marriage , historically speaking , nor was there a sense of purpose that extended beyond the creation of children			1
and because these children could only be born through heterosexual sex , no model of marriage outside these biologically driven norms existed			2
all this changed , however , with the advent of assisted reproduction technologies , commonly known as @entity66 as long ago as the 18th century , instances of artificial insemination with a husband 's sperm were reported			0
but the first case of insemination with donor sperm happened in the 19th century , when a doctor in @entity75 used sperm from one of his best - looking medical students to impregnate a supposedly infertile woman			0
the technique worked , a child was born and the woman ( who was told she was having an operation to cure her infertility ) never knew of the switch			0
after that point , as word slowly spread , doctors began to quietly experiment with artificial insemination with donor sperm , working only with infertile heterosexual couples , turning to friends of the couple or -- once again -- their medical students			1
over time , though , as the practice became more widespread and eventually commercial , single and lesbian women began availing themselves of the wares sold openly from sperm banks such as @entity99 and @entity100			1
for a few hundred dollars a vial , women began creating families that could not have been imagined before ; families created from the beginning without a father			1
even more radical was the invention , in 1978 , of in - vitro fertilization , or @entity110 , the now - common technique in which egg and sperm meet in a laboratory petri dish and create an embryo that is then implanted in the would - be mother 's womb			1
once again , the earliest users of @entity110 were infertile heterosexual couples ; and once again , the technology soon slipped into wider social circles , enabling people to become parents in a whole range of previously unimaginable ways			1
there was always adoption , but that avenue was largely closed to gay couples			1
now , using ivf and a surrogate carrier , a gay man could contract for the creation of a child both legally and socially his			0
using @entity110 , a surrogate and donated eggs , a gay couple could mix and match their sperm with the desired characteristics of an egg donor , creating children with , say , the actual genes of one partner and the mimicked characteristics of the other			2
today , anecdotal data suggest that gay men are among the largest users of surrogacy services			2
@entity99 reports that in 2009 , one - third of its clients were lesbian couples			0
ten years ago , it was 7 %			0
technology has enabled what biology could not , creating millions of children for parents desperate to conceive them			1
most of these formerly infertile parents are straight ; but many , and a rapidly growing number , are gay			2
they are the families created on the back of technological advance , families whose legal status has not yet caught up with their lives			0
technology always moves faster than the law			0
but in these cases , the products of technological advances are not faster vehicles or better widgets			0
they are children , hundreds of thousands of them , growing up in families no longer constrained by nature 's original dictate			0
it is kids who are shaping different norms of parenting and different kinds of care			0
and it is kids who deserve the same rights afforded their friends and classmates -- the right to grow up in a legally sanctioned family , regardless of who their parents are and how they came into being			1
to treat them otherwise would be truly inconceivable			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity191 : historically , families could not begin without a mother and father
@entity191 : but technology and surrogacy accomplish what biology could n't
@entity191 : gay couples using surrogacy more and more ; lesbians using sperm banks
all these kids born in *nontraditional* homes deserve parents to be married , she says
