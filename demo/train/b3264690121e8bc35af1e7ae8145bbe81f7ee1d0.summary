on a fall night two years ago , @entity0 , the alleged victim of a brutal gang rape , recounted her story in vivid detail to two friends			1
she recalled the assault for @entity6 and @entity7 on picnic tables at the quaint @entity10 campus			1
" her lips were quivering and ( she ) looked like somebody who had just been through some really traumatic experience , " said @entity6 , who met @entity0 through a mutual friend at orientation			1
" i 've never seen anyone look like that before			0
i really hope i never have to see anyone look like that again			0
" they sat outside a freshman dorm as she told of the shocking sexual assault , according to the friends			1
this was long before her account of the attack appeared in a now infamous @entity30 article published on november 19			1
that harrowing account described how @entity0 was lured to a fraternity house and allegedly raped by seven men at a @entity35 party			2
the article sparked international outrage and portrayed the @entity10 's response as cold and even tolerant of such horrific behavior			1
several weeks later , the magazine published an apology that raised questions about the authenticity of the story			2
@entity6 and @entity7 told @entity45 they remember a starkly different account than what appeared in @entity30			1
their version cast doubt over whether the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack even existed			0
" i mean there are definitely some major holes in the story , " said @entity7 , who also met @entity0 through a mutual friend at summer orientation			1
" i think that that was pretty clear in the @entity30 piece ... it was almost too perfect of a story			1
" @entity0 's lawyer declined to comment to @entity45 for this article			2
in its apology , @entity30 said of @entity0 , " our trust in her was misplaced			1
" the magazine later removed those words in an updated statement and said of its reporting errors , " these mistakes are on @entity30 , not on @entity0			1
" the magazine admitted that its writer had not contacted the man who allegedly brought about the attack			0
it said the writer did n't contact any of the men that @entity0 claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation			0
@entity6 and @entity7 said they were never contacted by the magazine ; instead , the writer portrayed them through @entity0 's eyes			1
" @entity30 is conducting a thorough internal review of the reporting , editing , and fact - checking of @entity94 's ' a rape on @entity95 , " the magazine said in a statement tuesday			1
if @entity0 , who supposedly had a crush on @entity6 , was indeed raped by the man her friends say went on a date with @entity0 on the night of september 28 , 2012 , his behavior was more brazen that originally thought			1
@entity45 has obtained text messages and an email from the man who @entity0 said lured her to the frat house , including one sent to @entity6 days after the alleged assault			1
bombshell rape story triggers weeks of turmoil at the @entity10 was @entity107 a real person ? since summer orientation in 2012 , @entity109 , @entity6 and another freshman , @entity110 , had become friends with @entity0			1
@entity6 said @entity0 was much more interested in him than he in her			1
he said he was happy when @entity0 told friends that an upperclassman in her chemistry class asked her on a date			2
@entity6 and @entity7 decided to learn more about the upperclassman and check to " see if he 's ok , " @entity6 said			1
@entity0 gave them the phone number for the man , whom she identified as @entity107			0
@entity7 and @entity6 said they sent him text messages and pretended to be another student from chemistry class			1
@entity107 purportedly texted back , saying of @entity0 , " i really like her , " and describing her as " super smart			0
. hot " and liking the same music as he			0
at one point , he even sent a photo of himself			0
@entity6 never suspected @entity107 may not be a real person			1
" no , " @entity6 said , " at the time , it all seemed very real			1
" @entity0 said she went on a date with @entity107 the evening in late september 2012 , when @entity30 reported that she was raped			1
late that night , @entity0 called @entity6			1
" she just said something bad had happened and could i come meet her , " he recalled			0
@entity6 and @entity7 met her outside the first - year dorms			1
they sat at the picnic tables			0
" it looked like she had been crying , " @entity6 remembered			2
" she was shaking ... obviously just scared about something			0
and it looked like she thought somebody might just pop out of the dark and just grab her or something			0
" @entity0 told her two friends that her date parked in front of the fraternity house , @entity6 said			1
the man told her he had to go up to his room and asked whether she wanted to join him			0
" she then said that when she went into the house and went up the stairs , her date locked the door of the room once they got in there , " @entity6 said			2
" and she said that there were five other men in the room who she was then forced to perform oral sex on			0
" @entity7 said she was very upset			2
friends saw inconsistencies in story " i did n't have any doubts that what she said happened had happened , " he said			2
but details of the assault chronicled in @entity30 did n't match what @entity0 told her friends , the two men said			1
in the article , for instance , she graphically describes a brutal gang rape by seven men instead of five			2
oral sex was not mentioned			0
the article described her date as a man named " @entity176 " who she met " while working lifeguard shifts together at the university pool			0
" in 2012 , she told her friends his name was " @entity181 " and they had met in chemistry class			2
the inconsistencies did not end there , according to @entity6 and @entity109			2
the article described how she was beaten , struck about the face and left barefoot and bloodied			0
that 's not what her friends remember			2
" i did n't notice any sort of physical injuries , " @entity6 said			2
" i did n't notice a lack of shoes			0
i really did n't notice anything that was consistent with the physical description that was in the article			0
" said @entity7 , " if there had been major injuries the way the article portrays , i think i would have remembered that			1
" a major criticism of the @entity30 article , titled " a rape on campus : a @entity207 and @entity208 at @entity10 , " was that the reporter did not seek comment from the alleged attackers			1
discrepancies in the account were later reported by the @entity211 and other news outlets			2
for instance , @entity35 did not have a party the night @entity0 said the rape occurred ; the man she identified as her date that night was not a member of that fraternity			0
perhaps the biggest discrepancy was the @entity30 article 's portrayal of how her friends reacted to news of the sexual assault : " the three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting @entity0 's rape while @entity0 stood beside them , mute in her bloody dress			1
" the article quoted @entity232 , whose was actually @entity110 , saying : " her reputation will be shot for the next four years			0
" @entity6 and @entity7 said that @entity110 was n't even part of the conversation			1
@entity0 did n't want the female friend to hear what happened			0
@entity110 waited about 25 feet away from the picnic table as @entity0 spoke with her two male friends			0
" that conversation never happened , " said @entity6			2
" that whole entire conversation about debating the social price of reporting a rape , and any sort of detriment to a reputation that might come around from reporting a rape , absolutely never happened			0
" @entity110 told @entity45 she was not part of the initial conversation			0
" the things she said about me were completely off , " @entity110 said of @entity0			0
" it was a powerful part of the story , but it was n't true			0
" they say @entity0 did n't want to call police the two friends said they tried desperately to convince @entity0 to call the police			0
she decided against it , they said			0
" i was really forceful in wanting to call the police , " @entity6 said			2
" i brought up the point a few times			0
but the reason we did n't call the police was because @entity0 did n't want to			0
she did n't want to have to go through ... constant interrogation by police officers which would cause her to continually relive this traumatic event			0
" the two friends said they slept on the floor of @entity0 's dorm to help her get through the night			2
five days later , @entity6 said he inexplicably received an email titled " about you " from @entity181 , the man allegedly behind the alleged sexual assault			1
( when @entity45 tried the email address , the message came back " undeliverable			0
" ) " it was from @entity281 ... and it looked like @entity181 had written , ' you should read this , i 've never read anything nicer in my life , ' with a page worth -- an essay -- that @entity0 had written about me , " @entity6 said			2
" which seemed really weird to me , even at the time , because here 's somebody who allegedly just led a brutal sexual assault on a friend of mine , and now he 's going to email me this thing about me ? " @entity0 told her friends that @entity107 dropped out of the university after the assault , but a university record check by @entity45 revealed that no one by that name ever attended the university			1
another check found no one by that name in the @entity305			0
the photo @entity107 supposedly sent @entity6 via text message matched that of a man who went to high school with @entity0 in @entity311 , @entity312			2
" there 's a very good chance whoever i was texting was @entity0 , " @entity7 said			1
" there 's a definite possibility			0
" @entity0 and her three friends drifted apart long before the @entity30 article , though her friends believe something bad may have happened to her that september night			1
" i think it 's very possible , yeah , " @entity6 said			1
" i still think it 's extremely , extremely possible			0
if only because the reaction she had on that night seemed so strong , and seemed so genuine , that i still think it 's difficult to believe that she would have been acting			1

friends of victim in @entity10 rape story paint different picture of alleged assault
@entity7 : " there are definitely some major holes in the story "
an account of alleged rape in @entity30 was criticized
@entity6 : " it 's difficult to believe that she would have been acting "
