@entity0 -- raising their family in @entity0 , @entity3 @entity2 and @entity4 were keen for their children to stay in touch with their @entity9 heritage			1
but the couple became concerned that their three young daughters did n't speak any @entity13 , one of @entity3 's ethnic languages			1
" we thought amongst ourselves what we can do to actually help them to learn @entity13 more , " says @entity16			0
this desire to encourage their children to connect with their roots , coupled with an increasing frustration with the difficulty in finding black dolls that resonated with their daughters , led the entrepreneurial couple to take matters into their hands			1
what started as a way of helping their daughters engage with their heritage quickly became a business opportunity			0
soon after , the couple launched their own range of toys , called @entity39 , programmed to speak in several native african languages and promote positive self - images			1
" we observed that over 90 % of children born or living in the diaspora and millions in @entity45 do not speak or understand their mother tongues , " says @entity4			1
" our research made us understand that the reason for this is not because our children do n't want to learn their mother tongues , but more because there are not many essential tools that can easily be both educational and fun at the same time			2
" read this : @entity55 moves to @entity45 with @entity57 edition so far , the couple has produced a range of 12 dolls from different @entity9 countries			1
each one can speak a combination of languages , and each one has her own story			1
amongst them , there 's @entity68 , a " vibrant girl " with @entity3 parents , who " loves watching @entity70 " and can interact in the @entity3 languages of @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75 ; there 's @entity77 , a " bubbling dynamic girl " whose " dream is to be a doctor someday , " and can speak the @entity83 languages of @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 ; and there 's also @entity89 , with parents from @entity91 and @entity92			1
she " loves adventures , reading and listening to beautiful music " and can communicate in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98			0
@entity4 says the toys , which come in different shades of skin color , are designed to break down stereotypes and to provide a more accurate representation of black people			0
" over the years my wife and i have found it extremely hard finding real black dolls that can truly connect with our little daughters , " he says			2
" the dolls out there in the market are nothing close to the real image of a black child in terms of features and other attributes -- they are either too thin , too light or chiseled - faced , and even the complexions of most of the dolls are kind of whitewashed , " says @entity4			2
" the unfortunate effect of this stereotypical misrepresentation is a case of low self - esteem among black children who have been directly or indirectly made to believe less in themselves as a black child			2
they have been made to believe that you have to look like a white doll to be accepted as beautiful or even good			0
" @entity131 , author of " the @entity132 to @entity133 , " says that black dolls have changed a lot over the years			2
in the early days of black dolls , she explains , many of them were negative characterizations with exaggerated facial features , including protruding eyes , broader - than - normal noses and accentuated lips that were often painted red			2
these dolls frequently maintained a posture of servitude as butlers or " mammies			0
" read this : @entity9 slave traditions live on in @entity151 " today 's black dolls have evolved from negative caricatures to play - scale representations of haute couture fashion models and other positive images of babies , toddlers and adult black people , " says @entity152			1
she adds , however , that while today 's dolls are more positive representations , " a lack of black dolls is a constant , as black - doll manufacture is often a second thought for those in the business of producing dolls in their image			0
" but for @entity152 , access to dolls can only achieve so much in terms of promoting a positive self image			0
" in addition to a black child owning dolls and other playthings that positively reflect their image , exposure to literature , art and other positive images will aid in the development of a healthy cultural awareness and appreciation , " she says			0
that was the inspiration behind the @entity191 project , an educational initiative developed by @entity3 entrepreneur @entity193			0
using a mix of dolls , books , comics and music , @entity194 is aiming to help children in @entity3 and beyond to identify and appreciate their culture			1
" the crucial part of the formative years of children is between four - nine years , " says @entity193			0
" this is the time to load them with valuable information that they can draw on as adults			0
" similarly to the @entity211 , @entity193 's foray into the business was inspired by his family			0
some five years ago , he went into an upmarket @entity57 store to buy a doll as a birthday present for his young niece , but left disappointed			0
" i wanted to buy her something that would be quite encouraging or instrumental in her development , " he says			0
" i realized that they had an array of different dolls but none of them were black and they were rather pricey			0
" read this : boy scares off lions with flashy invention that gave @entity193 food for thought and after some initial research , he decided to launch the @entity194 black dolls , each one representing different tribes in the continent			1
later on , he decided to expand the project by launching a series of fun and educational books , songs and cartoons based on the dolls ' characters			1
" the dolls will help the @entity3 / @entity9 [ children ] be better people because they would be proud and confident in who they are as a race , " says @entity193			1
" the comics , books and animation stories is the medium we use to enlighten and educate children on our history and culture			1
" @entity258 says that exposure to this kind of information can help @entity9 children learn about their roots , as well as proudly pass on their heritage to future generations			1
" it is imperative for @entity9 or any non-white child to possess or have access to playthings that reflect their image positively , " she says .			2

a new range of dolls has has been created to help @entity9 children connect with their roots
@entity39 are programmed to speak several @entity9 languages
" @entity194 " project produces comics and books to help @entity9 children appreciate their culture
