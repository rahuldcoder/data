so much for a short @entity2 primary season			1
the shadow campaign is already in full swing as @entity5 and @entity6 openly consider presidential runs that would tap many of the same political and financial resources			1
@entity5 told donors friday he 's considering a third presidential run while @entity6 is forming a political action committee to use as a possible vessel for a presidential effort			1
the former @entity15 governor is also in @entity16 this week meeting with donors , according to two sources familiar with his plans			2
there will be even more 2016 speculation later this month when a handful of possible candidates attend a gathering in @entity25			2
and all of this is happening more than a year before any @entity2 actually casts a ballot			1
these early developments could hamper the @entity2 's efforts to keep the primary season brief and orderly after 2012 's marathon campaign , which included 20 debates and nearly 10 candidates			1
that prolonged primary provided ample ammunition to @entity36			2
after the failed @entity2 campaign to topple president @entity39 in 2012 , the @entity37 concluded that the primary season needed to be contained and shortened			1
the @entity37 went on to adopt changes to the primary calendar at the party 's winter meeting in 2014 , where they shrunk the official primary season by pushing the first contest back to february 2016 and holding the party convention in early june			1
the decision will require all states to choose delegates within a contracted window , as opposed to the drawn - out eight months in the last cycle			2
the party is also moving toward limiting the number of debates and taking more control over choosing moderators for the events			2
the decision was made in part to limit the chance of public , embarrassing episodes over a long and exhausting campaign period			0
that decision is expected to be formalized at the @entity37 's meeting in @entity67 this week			0
debates are expected to begin near the end of the summer , and the party is aiming to hold about 10 sanctioned contests , an @entity37 committee member said			0
@entity37 spokeswoman @entity73 told @entity0 that candidates are free to start their campaigns as early as they want , but with the knowledge that the electoral contests wo n't begin until february 2016 at the earliest			1
in 2012 , the @entity25 caucuses were held on jan. 3 , and others followed almost immediately after			0
" we 're doing what we can to contract the process , while allowing the primary voters to make their decisions and see the candidates they need to see , " @entity73 said			0
" it 's up to the campaigns to decide if it makes sense strategically to be running a campaign a year before ballots are going to be out on money , staff and infrastructure			0
" regardless , it does n't appear that the possible candidates are taking their time			0
on jan. 6 , @entity6 rolled out a leadership pac called " right to rise , " which effectively served as the starting gun for the @entity2 primary contest			1
just three days later , @entity5 told donors gathered in @entity102 that he may run despite habitually denying his ambition after the 2012 race			0
this week , @entity15 sen. @entity105 is scheduled to hold donor meetings in @entity102 as well			0
and with more than a year to go before the first @entity25 caucus meetings , potential candidates are already putting their teams together for the long slog and signing on for pre-primary cattlecalls			0
on jan. 24 , @entity25 @entity112 rep. @entity112 will co-host the inaugural " @entity114 " with the advocacy group @entity113			0
so far , nearly every 2016 hopeful has accepted the invitations to speak , including @entity118 gov. @entity117 , @entity120 gov. @entity119			0
@entity6 , however , declined			1
@entity2 say that despite the early movements , the party can still fulfill the goals of truncating the official calendar			1
" i think we 're still better off than we were , even if these guys stretch out the donor process in the front end , " @entity2 strategist @entity125 told @entity0			1
" for all the early chatter , most of it is political class stuff , not about voter attention			2
" @entity0 's @entity135 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 has tried to cut down length of primaries
but early action by @entity6 , @entity141 could blunt those efforts
