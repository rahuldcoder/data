-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 tried to defuse tensions between @entity4 and @entity5 , a strategic @entity2 partner , on saturday , asking the two rival nations to return to negotiations over a group of @entity11 islands under dispute			1
during a press conference at the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) summit in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity13 said the @entity2 is willing to serve as mediator in the disagreement , which began to simmer last month when @entity5 detained a @entity4 vessel that collided with @entity5 boats in the disputed waters			1
" we 've recommended to both [ @entity5 and @entity4 ] that the @entity2 is more than willing to host a trilateral where we would bring @entity4 and @entity5 and their foreign ministers together to discuss a range of issues , " @entity13 said saturday			1
" it is in all of our interest for @entity4 and @entity5 to have stable , peaceful relations , " she said , a senior @entity2 official told @entity0 that @entity13 had raised the issue of three - way talks with @entity4 state counselor @entity36 on @entity37 and foreign minister @entity38 in @entity16 on the sidelines of the @entity15 summit			1
she also raised it with @entity5 foreign minister @entity42 in @entity43 earlier in the week , the official said			2
@entity4 and @entity5 have historically laid claim to the islands , which lie between the two nations			1
called @entity48 by the @entity5 and @entity48 by @entity4 , the uninhabited islands have become the center of an escalating diplomatic spat			1
on friday , @entity4 's foreign ministry spokesman showed some irritation over @entity13 's claim that the @entity48 fall within the scope of a @entity2 - @entity5 security treaty			1
" with respect to the @entity48 , the @entity2 has never taken a position on sovereignty , but we have made it very clear that the islands are part of our mutual treaty obligations , and the obligation to defend @entity5 , " @entity13 said saturday			1
" we have certainly encouraged both @entity5 and @entity4 to seek peaceful resolution of any disagreements that they have in this area or others			1
" @entity71 , the foreign ministry spokesman , said @entity4 " will never accept any word or deed that includes the @entity48 of the @entity2 - @entity75			0
" the crew of the @entity4 vessel was released following the incident last month			0
but the @entity4 captain remains in custody , accused of ramming two @entity5 boats with his vessel			2
on friday , @entity5 said it will release the captain , but did not offer a time frame			0
the economic repercussions have been immediate			0
the @entity4 government cut off high - level talks with @entity5 on coal and increased commercial flights between the countries			2
the dispute also threatens planned talks on a 2008 agreement to jointly develop gas fields located near the disputed islands and in other parts of the @entity96			0
the @entity4 - @entity5 dispute parallels @entity2 efforts to curb @entity4 claims for territory in the @entity101 , out of fear the increasingly powerful @entity4 military could seek to dominate @entity105 waters			2
at a regional security forum in @entity17 in july , @entity13 waded into thorny territorial disputes in the area , saying @entity109 was concerned competing claims to the territory undermined international maritime law and commerce			0
while @entity4 has sought to negotiate territorial rights to the @entity101 individually with countries in the region , the @entity15 nations have called for a collaborative resolution			0
@entity4 maintains the disputes should not be " internationalized			0
" in addition to rich areas for fishing , the islands in the @entity101 are believed to have large oil and gas reserves and surround busy sea lanes shuttling resources for @entity4 's fast - growing economy			2
@entity128 has warned @entity2 that foreign interference in the waters off its southeastern coast constitute an affront on its sovereignty			0
