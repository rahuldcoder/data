-- @entity2 star @entity1 rode clear of the leading group to win the @entity5 cycling classic on sunday and complete a rare double having claimed the @entity6 earlier this spring			1
the ' @entity7 ' is traditionally an event for the strongmen of the sport who have to negotiate 27 sections of cobblestones and the reigning @entity15 time trial champion perfectly fits the bill			2
he made his move on the 10th from last section of pave at @entity21 , about 45km from the finish in the velodrome at @entity5 , quickly chasing down a small breakaway group before opening up a winning gap			0
defending champion @entity26 of @entity27 and the other leading contenders fatally hesitated in their efforts to chase down @entity30 's @entity1 and their race was over			1
@entity32 crossed the line alone for his second @entity5 win and only the 10th man to complete the double with @entity37			0
@entity40 @entity39 beat @entity42 @entity41 for the runners - up spot in a sprint finish , the pair having finally given chase to @entity1 but too little too late			1
last week @entity1 became the first @entity2 since @entity46 in 1923 to win at @entity37			0
@entity1 was winning his fourth major one - day classic with @entity48 in 2006 , two at @entity5 ( 2006 and 2010 ) and this year 's @entity6			2
i knew that with my form and the way the last weeks were going i would be difficult to catch once i took a 10 meter lead , that they would be scared , " @entity1 told @entity50 at the finish of the 259km race .			0
