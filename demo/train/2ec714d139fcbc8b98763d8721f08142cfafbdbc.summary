-- @entity1 woke up to a giant collective hangover monday as the rugby - mad nation savored its triumph in the @entity7 final in @entity8			1
no matter the 8 - 7 final win over @entity11 was more notable for perspiration than inspiration , the @entity1 had finally laid a 24 - year - old hoodoo since their victory in the first - ever @entity7 in @entity1 in 1987			1
despite being the @entity16 ranked international team for most of the intervening years , success on the ultimate stage eluded successive @entity1 teams			0
the nadir perhaps was the failure of the 2007 team , who fell victim to an inspired @entity27 team in @entity28 in the quarterfinals			0
but also long in the memory were defeats in the 1995 final to @entity32 and semifinal defeats in 1999 and 2003			0
but @entity35 's men , badly missing the influence and the accurate boot of injured fly - half @entity38 , held on for a one - point win in the lowest scoring final in the tournament 's history			2
blog : are formidable @entity11 owed an apology ? for four million @entity47 , the manner of the victory mattered not a jot , a welcome diversion in a year which began with the @entity51 earthquake disaster and continued with a mining disaster and nasty oil spill in the @entity54			2
after the final at @entity56 , @entity1 were named team of the year in the @entity59 annual awards and @entity35 was coach of the year			1
player of the year was the @entity27 captain @entity61 , who did his best to spoil the @entity1 ' party with his second half try			0
on monday , captain @entity65 his team paraded the @entity66 through the streets of @entity8 on an open top bus with an estimated crowd of 200,0000 in attendance			0
