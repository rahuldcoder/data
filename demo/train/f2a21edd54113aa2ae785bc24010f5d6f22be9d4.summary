-- @entity1 is looking to the comforts of home as he continues his bid to hold the year - end world no. 1 ranking for the first time since 2009			1
the @entity8 tennis star needs to defend his title in @entity10 to avoid dropping points in the run - up to the season - ending finals in @entity14 next month , with @entity15 seeking to regain his place at the top			1
" it is just so great to play at home as world number one after the season i 've had , " the 31 - year - old told reporters following monday 's first - round win over @entity20 at the @entity22 hard - court event			1
" it 's a wonderful feeling to be here playing at the top of my game			0
sometimes things just all come together			0
" @entity1 , playing for the first time since losing to @entity35 in the @entity37 semifinals earlier this month , won 7 - 5 6 - 3 against the 83rd - ranked @entity38 -- a late replacement for injured @entity41 @entity40			2
" he broke me at 2 - 3 but i was able to get it straight back			0
it all went so fast at the end , but the first set was really tough , " said @entity1 , who has won the @entity10 title five times and been runner - up on three occasions in 12 previous appearances			2
the @entity53 champion now has more than 300 career weeks at no. 1 -- the first man to do so -- but faces a difficult task to hold off second - ranked @entity15 , who won the @entity37 title and has the chance of picking up more points due to his lackluster end to 2011			1
the @entity63 has taken this week off ahead of the men 's season 's penultimate event , the @entity67 -- which @entity1 also won last year before triumphing in the @entity68			1
with @entity69 champion @entity35 pulling out of @entity10 for the second year in a row , this time due to a back problem , @entity1 faces a relatively weak field			0
the @entity74 silver medalist next takes on either @entity76 's @entity75 or @entity78 's @entity77 , and would not play a top - 10 player until the final should his 2009 @entity69 conqueror @entity80 make it that far			0
the eighth - ranked @entity82 won this month 's event in @entity84 in his first singles tournament since september 's @entity69 , having suffered a recurrence of his wrist injury during the @entity89 semifinal against the @entity90			0
meanwhile , @entity91 -- who led the @entity92 into the november 16 - 18 final against @entity94 -- has become the sixth player to qualify for the eight - man season - ending event in @entity14			1
@entity91 , who won his eighth career title in @entity98 on sunday , follows @entity15 , @entity1 , @entity35 , @entity99 and @entity100 -- who is unlikely to take his place at the showpiece event due to his knee injury			2
meanwhile , the women 's season - ending @entity104 start on tuesday in @entity106 , with @entity107 beginning her bid to wrest the no. 1 ranking from @entity110			1
the @entity111 will take on @entity113 's @entity112 in a repeat of june 's @entity116 final , which @entity107 won , while defending champion @entity117 will launch the tournament against @entity119 in the other group b match			2
" unfortunately last year i was a bit injured and was n't able to play 100 % , so it 's nice coming in this year knowing i 'm ready , " said @entity107			0
third - ranked @entity123 , who can not topple @entity110 despite her victories at @entity53 , the @entity125 and the @entity69 , will play @entity38 's @entity126 in tuesday 's other match			0
@entity129 @entity128 , also in @entity130 along with @entity132 's @entity131 , needs to win two matches to seal the year - end no. 1 spot			1
