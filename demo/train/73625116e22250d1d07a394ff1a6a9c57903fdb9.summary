@entity0 -- the head of @entity3 on tuesday sharply deplored recent videos showing some of the group 's workers advising people how to set up a prostitution business			1
@entity3 leader @entity9 defends her group at the @entity11 on tuesday in @entity0			1
" it made my stomach turn , " @entity9 , chief executive officer of @entity3 , told reporters at the @entity11 in @entity0			1
" it just made you sick			0
" @entity3 workers who did perform their tasks properly " did not deserve to have co-workers who did not live up to their standards , " @entity16 said			1
" so yes , i terminated those employees			0
" at the same time , @entity16 defended the community organizing group and punched back at widespread criticism , touting the group 's efforts in helping poor people in the areas of housing and voting			1
she backed up the group 's legal action in @entity33 against the makers of one of the videos			1
video , shot with a hidden camera , shows conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute			0
@entity16 said that " we want to hold them accountable " for what she said was breaking the law			2
similar videos were made at other @entity3 offices			1
" it is illegal , as @entity50 will tell you , to record someone in the state of @entity33 without their permission			0
just because we were embarrassed by these highly edited tapes , which do n't tell the whole story again , and hopefully that will come out , does n't mean that these people did n't break the law in order to embarrass and attack the organization , " @entity16 said			2
@entity16 was referring to the former @entity63 employee who recorded conversations with @entity63 intern @entity65 about her sexual encounters with president @entity67 , which ultimately led to his impeachment			2
@entity3 -- which stands for @entity3 -- was in the headlines during last year 's presidential campaign after @entity73 allegations of falsifying voter registration applicants			1
some of its voter registration workers were prosecuted , and some other employees resigned			1
but after the recent release of videos , the political criticism grew			0
in the videos , some @entity3 workers advised the undercover conservative activists how to set up a prostitution business involving underage , foreign girls			1
along with firing employees , @entity3 also is conducting an investigation through an independent auditor			2
the justice and @entity90 departments are investigating the group , too			0
the @entity94 has terminated @entity3 's involvement in its public outreach program , both chambers of @entity93 have voted to deny federal funding to the organization , and several states are looking into @entity3 operations			1
in addition , @entity3 suspended tax preparation services it carried out as part of an @entity105 program			2
and @entity106 announced it is pulling its funding of an @entity3 housing affiliate until it is satisfied that all issues related to the organization have been resolved			2
@entity16 contends the group also has been responsive to allegations that some canvassers falsified voter registration applications and turned in those who falsified voter registration forms			1
" we were punished for following the law and doing the right thing , and that part of the story was never told , " she said			0
" and so nine months later it finally began to resonate with folks that we had not had one individual who voted fraudulently in the presidential election because of an @entity3 registration -- not one @entity128 , not one @entity129 , not one @entity130 , @entity131 or any other fraudulent person			1
" one of the shadows over @entity3 is an embezzling incident involving @entity135 , the brother of @entity3 founder @entity136			2
@entity16 acknowledged that the founder 's sibling embezzled nearly $ 1 million from the group			1
she disputed reports that a subpoena from the @entity143 attorney general 's office showed that the amount was up to $ 5 million			0
@entity16 said the claim is " speculation , " completely false " and not based on any documentation			0
she attributed the contention to two " disgruntled former board members			0
" @entity16 ' group works in poor precincts across the country considered @entity154 turf			2
she said e-mails from @entity157 , when he was @entity159 's top political adviser , show that @entity3 was targeted to stop its voter registration efforts because " we were moving too many minorities to vote " and " changing the power dynamics " in local elections			1
such critics of the group believe " we needed to be stopped , " @entity16 said			2
" i do think that after 40 years of going after the rich and powerful , i think you make some powerful enemies			0
i think since 2004 , things have been ramped up			0
" @entity16 said @entity3 has been demonized and news about it has served as a @entity73 fund - raising tool			1
she said this form of " modern - day @entity173 has got to stop			0
" " last week , members of @entity93 were asked , ' are you now or have you ever been members of @entity3 ? everybody should take pause at that			0
everybody should say , ' wait a minute			0
this is not how we have discourse , ' " she said , making reference to the familiar phrase from mccarthy - era hearings in the 1950s : " are you now or have you ever been a communist ? " appointed to her post in 2008 , @entity16 said she has been working hard to improve the group 's management practices to " restrengthen , reorganize and put together the 21st - century @entity3			1
" " i 'm proud to say that they 've made it clear to me that i will continue to be tortured for at least another year			0
if the board thought or our membership thought that i should resign , i would do it in a heartbeat , " she said			0
" i do n't think , however , it is fair to judge me as i 'm cleaning up a previous administration , and now we have real documentation that these are political attacks on us , which is unprecedented			0
