a new @entity1 - based activist group released a detailed proposal on how to legalize recreational marijuana this week , potentially adding @entity1 to the growing list of states nationwide where use of the drug is permitted			1
these efforts by @entity9 , based largely on an agenda of statewide economic growth , mark the second attempt in the state in recent months to put pot before voters in 2016			1
@entity16 , the group 's leader , highlighted the potential benefits of pot legalization -- including a substantial boost in tourism -- in a press conference in the state 's capital wednesday			1
" our goal is a rural economic revival , " he said , according to the @entity25			0
" @entity1 is dying and we need to stop that			2
marijuana is not the golden ticket , but it 's part of the solution			2
" to be eligible for a voter referendum in november 2016 , about 61,000 signatures would be needed by january 2016			0
@entity16 said the group hopes to collect about 80,000 signatures in the state , and will start their activism soon			2
if the plan is approved , adults aged 21 and older would be allowed to possess an unlimited amount of pot in their homes -- and they 'd also be permitted to grow the plant , provided they obtain a license			0
the goal is to give at least 75 percent of these licenses to owners of small farms in an effort to cultivate statewide industry			0
like alcohol , marijuana would be taxed at 8 % , and its use would be permitted in clubs			0
the @entity56 , a national group based in @entity57 , is also working toward a ballot initiative in @entity1			1
this group also needs signatures to make it on the ballot -- but so far , it is unclear whether the two activist organizations will work together			2
in some @entity1 cities , voters voiced support earlier this month for recreational pot legalization , while the initiative was defeated in other regions			1
these votes were largely symbolic , though , as there is not yet any overarching state or federal laws on the books			0
medical marijuana has been legal in the @entity77 since 1999			0
so far , only four states -- @entity79 , @entity57 , @entity80 and @entity81 , as well as @entity57 -- have legalized recreational marijuana			1
laws in these places remain hazy , as consuming marijuana is still listed as a schedule 1 narcotic under federal law			0
as the tide continues to turn in favor of legal marijuana on the state level , a bipartisan group members of @entity89 have clamored for legal adjustments on the national level			1
" it 's not more dangerous than methamphetamines or cocaine , " said @entity81 @entity97 rep. @entity96 at an event last week , pointing out that there were zero deaths caused by marijuana last year			0
for the first time , most @entity105 favored pot legalization in october : the idea garnered 58 % percent support , according to an october @entity111 poll .			1

a new group in @entity1 wants to put pot on the statewide ballot in 2016
