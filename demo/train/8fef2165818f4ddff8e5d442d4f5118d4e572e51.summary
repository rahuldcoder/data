@entity0 -- about half all @entity4 's registered voters had cast ballots through the second and final day of the country 's historic presidential election , a top elections official said thursday			1
@entity8 continued into the night thursday			0
@entity9 , head of the @entity10 , vowed on state television that the election would continue until the last person in any given polling station had cast his vote			1
amid worries by some that @entity4 's current military rulers might somehow hijack the election , @entity9 detailed the vote counting process -- including checks and balances aimed at insuring credibility			1
according to the committee head , votes will be tallied in the various polling locales by a judge and in the presence of representatives of the candidates			2
each final count will be announced aloud , then an official report will be filed that can be viewed by nonprofit groups , the media and candidates , said @entity9			1
there are 13 candidates on the ballot , although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed			1
if no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round , a second round will be held june 16 - 17			1
results of the first round are not expected before the weekend			0
government employees were given the day off work to vote to decide who will be @entity4 's first president since @entity51 , who led the @entity53 nation for 30 years before resigning amid a popular outcry			1
he is awaiting the court 's verdict and could potentially face the death penalty after going on trial for allegedly ordering the killing of anti-government protesters and corruption			2
@entity8 went smoothly in a northern suburb of @entity0 earlier thursday , where women waited between 30 and 45 minutes to cast their ballots			0
a day earlier , a wave of enthusiasm swept across polling stations , with some waiting up to four hours to vote			2
" finally , @entity4 is born , " one weeping 80 - year - old man told @entity72 rep. @entity71 , a @entity74 @entity73 who is in @entity0 as an election observer			1
grandmother @entity77 , 70 , was so determined to be the first one to vote at her polling station that she camped out in a plastic chair for 2Â½ hours before it opened on wednesday			2
" i am here to vote for the first time in my life , " said @entity81			2
" i want to see a new generation for my country			0
i want everything to change			0
" @entity88 : is @entity4 ready ? after polls closed that day , a former top @entity90 official called the election a potential turning point for the country			1
if " ordinary @entity4 see this as a legitimate expression of their own popular will , " regardless of who wins , " then it can be a prelude to the real return of security and stability in the country , " said @entity95			1
the former top diplomat and development expert said he was very optimistic about what lay ahead for @entity4 in a few years down the road , even if the country was probably in for a " bumpy ride " in the short term			1
" we went through this with @entity113 after 1989 , " when the communist regimes there fell , @entity95 told @entity1 's " @entity117 " program			2
" it just takes time			0
people need to settle into a new political order			0
whatever happens in the next months , people need to just hold onto the fact that ( @entity4 ) will get there			1
" he predicted that a post-revolutionary @entity4 would be " a little bit more @entity125 than it was before , a little bit more feisty and independent vis - a - vis the @entity72 and @entity128 , " while domestically , it would " really try and focus on doing a much better deal for poor @entity4			1
" @entity4 elections : ' women need a champion ' the voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple @entity51 in one of the seminal developments of the @entity138 more than a year ago			1
and it could reverberate far beyond the country 's borders , since @entity4 is in many ways the center of gravity of the @entity146 world			1
@entity4 police officers convicted of murder in protest crackdown " @entity4 has always set trends in the @entity146 world and for @entity146 political thought			2
trends spread through the @entity146 world and eventually affect even @entity158 , muslim - majority countries , " said @entity152 , the chairman of @entity153 , a @entity155 - based think tank			2
@entity4 's election " bodes well for the rest of the @entity146 world and particularly those countries that have had uprisings , " said @entity152 , a former @entity159 who was imprisoned in @entity4 for four years for banned political activism			1
in a report released thursday , @entity166 was critical of the military leaders who rule @entity4 in its annual report on human rights around the world			2
" in some cases they 've continued the abuses of the @entity51 regime , in that over 100 people have been killed in the streets in demonstrations as a result of excessive force used by security or military forces , " said @entity171 , deputy director for the advocacy group 's @entity173 and @entity53 program			1
@entity166 is also opposed to the use of " virginity testing " on some women protesters , saying it is " tantamount to torture and totally unacceptable			0
" the authorities have not done enough to ensure that women can contribute on an equal footing with men to the ongoing process of political reform , @entity171 also said			0
@entity166 wants whoever takes office as president to end the state of emergency and end the use of military trials for civilians			0
@entity4 's revolution : ' we fell in love , but it was a trick ' the concern about the powerful military possibly swaying this week 's vote persists despite the insistence of the @entity211 that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government			1
the military leaders put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power , but that did not convince doubters			0
some 30,000 volunteers have fanned out to make sure the voting is fair , said organizers with the april 6 youth movement , which has long campaigned for greater democracy and rule of law in @entity4			1
they reported only minor violations on wednesday , mostly supporters of one candidate or another trying to influence voters at polling stations			0
@entity152 , the analyst in @entity155 , said @entity4 probably is not heading toward a simple case of the military either giving up control or rejecting the results of the election			1
instead , he anticipated , there will be an " unhappy settlement " where the military remains " ever - present , in the shadows , " influencing the civilian government without controlling it			0
old politics joins new in @entity4 " @entity4 is going along similar lines to @entity251 or @entity252 , " he said , naming two other countries that have formal democracies in place but where a powerful military can affect events			2
the degree to which the military continues to exercise control in @entity4 will depend on who wins the election , @entity152 anticipated -- but he laughed aloud when asked to predict who that would be			1
whoever wins the election , @entity152 said , will face tremendous challenges , even without worries about the army			0
" they are inheriting a failed economy , an abysmal bureaucracy , a frustrated people , and a deep distrust on behalf of the people towards their military and any policing , " @entity152 said			0
protesters are upset at what they see as the slow pace of reform since @entity51 's ouster			0
some are also concerned that the country 's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule			0
and @entity4 has an elaborate political mosaic where alliances shift quickly , he added			2
secular democrats oppose military rule , for example , but if an @entity159 candidate wins the presidency , " some of the democrats would switch because they would rather have military rule than the @entity159 , " @entity152 said			0
opinion : @entity4 's military must stop torturing detainees " it 's far more complicated than ' islamists vs. liberal democracy			1
' it 's rich vs. poor , ( hardline ) @entity299 vs. the ( more moderate ) @entity300 , secularists vs. @entity159 , " he said			0
on top of that , the country does not yet have a new constitution defining the powers of the president or the parliament , after a court last month suspended the committee charged with writing it			0
the court ruled that the members of the committee did not reflect the national population well enough			0
among the candidates vying for the presidency are @entity316 , of the @entity300 's @entity317 ; @entity318 , who served as foreign minister under @entity51 and headed the @entity320 ; @entity321 , a moderate @entity159 running as a respected independent ; @entity323 , who was @entity51 's last prime minister ; and @entity324 , a leftist dark - horse contender			1
in january , two @entity159 parties -- the @entity317 with 235 seats and the conservative @entity327 with 121 seats -- won about 70 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the @entity335 era			2
the rest of the assembly 's 498 seats were divided among other parties			0
@entity1 's @entity340 and @entity341 and journalists @entity342 and @entity81 contributed to this report from @entity0			0
@entity345 and @entity346 reported from @entity155 .			0
