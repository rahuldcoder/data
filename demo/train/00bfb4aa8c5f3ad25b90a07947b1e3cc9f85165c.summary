@entity1 refugee camp , @entity2 -- i 've spent the past week working in the @entity1 refugee camp in northern @entity2 , about six miles from the @entity7 border			1
the camp was opened less than a month ago to receive @entity7 fleeing the violence in their country			1
built on a barren desert plain without a tree or shrub in sight , it can seem an unwelcoming place to arrive , even for a refugee			1
dust storms and scorching heat have taken their toll on refugees and aid workers here			1
but given that less than 4 % of @entity2 land is arable the terrain is not a surprise			1
over 20,000 @entity7 refugees have moved into @entity1 camp already , and the pace of new arrivals to the camp has more than doubled , with more than 14,000 arriving in the past week alone			1
yesterday , we received over 3,000 new arrivals overnight , up from an average of 600 per day just last week			2
the refugee flow to @entity2 has a direct correlation with the situation inside @entity7			1
as fighting has escalated around @entity7 's southern city of @entity43 , where the uprising began almost 18 months ago , the number of refugees here is increasing dramatically			1
we are all bracing for a potentially massive influx in the coming days			0
yesterday , i met many newly - arrived refugees , some just children , who told me how had they witnessed family members and neighbors being killed in @entity7			1
one 7 - year old girl told me she saw her neighbor 's throat cut in front of her			0
her family fled in the dark of night , walking several hours before they could cross into @entity2			1
like every refugee i have met here , they were n't able to bring any belongings -- they came with only the clothes on their backs			1
humanitarian aid organizations and @entity66 agencies have been working around the clock to accommodate the sudden increase in new arrivals of refugees , while also working to improve the conditions			2
but the camp is growing exponentially and it is hard to keep up			2
i met with camp manager @entity74 of the @entity75 yesterday -- he told me , " we need more of everything			2
" more tents , improved water systems , more safe spaces and playgrounds for children and psycho - social counseling for children who have been traumatized are all top priorities			2
i have spoken with many mothers here , and most report that their children have terrible nightmares and are not behaving normally -- either they are being very aggressive and misbehaving , or they are silent and afraid , running and hiding at any loud noise			0
@entity91 , a refugee mother of five children , told me that when her family was trying to escape to @entity2 , they were shot at and her eldest son , @entity93 , was hit in the head by a bullet			1
the blood from his wound sprayed on his younger brother who is just 6 - years old			0
@entity93 survived and they made it across the border , but his little brother often wakes up screaming " there is blood on my shirt			0
" @entity91 does n't have any money to buy new clothes , so the little boy still wears the blood - stained shirt from that night			2
nearly half of the camps ' residents are children , and there is next to nothing for children to do here			0
providing an outlet for kids who have been through unimaginable , violent events and left everything they know behind is critical to helping them recover and just be kids			0
we have built one playground and another is almost completed			0
there are also child - friendly spaces that offer activities to kids			0
they are hard to miss in the camp -- just follow the unexpected sound of laughter and you will find swarms of kids singing , swinging , sliding and occasionally arguing over who 's turn it is			2
more playgrounds and child - friendly spaces are being planned as the camp population grows			2
improvements to the camp continue despite the massive amount of work going into accommodating new arrivals			2
the quality of the food has been a major complaint from many refugees in the camps			2
currently , they receive hot , pre-cooked meals that are distributed throughout the camp , but now communal kitchens are being built so families can cook for themselves			0
electricity is now installed in 40 per cent of the camp , making life a bit easier			0
charging mobile phones seems to be the primary use so far , based on what i have seen in the tents i visit			0
dust and sand storms are one of the greatest challenges of living in the camps			0
it is not just a discomfort , but it has become a health issue and camp doctors report that they are seeing many cases of respiratory problems , especially in infants and small children , due to the dust			0
many days it is hard to see more than a few meters in front of you in the camp , as the air is thick with sand and debris that is carried by the strong winds that blow through the barren camp			0
one mother told me , " not even a camel could live in this place , it is so hot and dusty			0
" the camp has been bringing in tons of gravel that is being spread on the ground to help alleviate the problem			0
water is one of the most pressing long - term issue that faces the refugees , as well as the local @entity2 communities			1
@entity2 has inadequate fresh water supplies for its own population , and the refugee community is putting increased demands on an already short supply			1
water is currently being trucked into the camps from local wells in the community , but @entity213 will be drilling a new well and developing a water system with other organizations that will serve the camp , and alleviate the need to take scarce water from the host community			1
the work ahead , to provide all the desperately needed services for the refugees is daunting , but it is under way			0
each day i am in the camp i see progress being made , even as we struggle to meet the pressing needs of all the new arrivals			1
no one knows how long the camp will be here and when the @entity7 refugees will be able to go home			1
many anticipate it will be a long haul , but all of us , especially the @entity7 here , are hopeful they can return soon			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			0

@entity1 refugee camp in northern @entity2 is home to more than 20,000 @entity7 refugees
*hundreds* more arrive every day , on foot , with just the clothes they are wearing
the refugees are putting pressure on already scarce water *resources* in the *region*
as the situation in @entity7 escalates , many fear they will be in the camp for some time
