-- it 's been a year since the @entity2 ratified the @entity3 with @entity4 , and it 's time to reflect on its benefits			1
by allowing us to restart inspections , verifications and the dismantling of nuclear assets , @entity3 has established transparency , predictability and stability that serves the security of the whole world			1
we know what the @entity4 have , and they know what we have , and together we are reducing our arsenals , allowing us all to sleep easier			2
keeping in mind the success of @entity3 , the next logical step would be to ratify the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , as @entity4 did in 2000			1
the establishment of such a ban on nuclear testing would further strengthen @entity2 security			1
start i was first proposed by president @entity30			0
the @entity2 and the @entity31 signed the agreement in 1991 , enhancing stability between the two nations and allowing for a drastic reduction in nuclear weapons			1
after the dissolution of the @entity31 , the treaty was inherited by @entity4 and continued until its expiration in december of 2009			1
the expiration of the treaty risked a new arms race that threatened the security gains of the past 17 years			0
succeeding the original agreement , @entity3 is the modern recognition that both our nations benefit by fostering transparency between our two strategic nuclear forces			0
it is no secret that during the course of the @entity51 , the @entity2 and @entity31 developed the nuclear capacity to destroy each other , and indeed the very existence of humanity , several times over			1
at the height of that conflict , the @entity2 and @entity31 possessed more than 65,000 nuclear weapons between them			1
nuclear strategy promoted the concept of " bouncing the rubble , " signifying the premise of destruction that nuclear war would unleash			0
yet this era demands thinking outside the conventions of nuclear war			0
we need weapons for fighting the enemies of today , not the @entity31 of yesteryear			2
in the wars in @entity75 and @entity76 , our greatest threat has not been nuclear weapons fueled by uranium , but buried homemade bombs fueled by fertilizer			1
investments in equipment , technology and training designed to combat low technology threats have proven more decisive in protecting the lives of our troops than any of our nuclear assets			0
of course , the @entity2 can and should maintain a strong , credible nuclear deterrent			1
it also can and should set an example for the rest of the world with responsible ownership of these weapons			2
after conducting more than 1,000 nuclear test explosions , the @entity2 has not explosively tested a nuclear weapon in nearly 20 years and instead maintains a stockpile stewardship program to ensure the reliability of the current arsenal			1
still the @entity100 resists approving the test ban treaty , which would create worldwide networks to apply pressure against states like @entity105 and @entity106			1
these networks of pressure are exactly what we need against rogue states that are n't deterred from nuclear development by the vast @entity2 arsenal			1
these states are more susceptible to pressure outside the nuclear realm , and our strategy must incorporate this understanding to be effective			2
this means taking a bold diplomatic leadership role			0
by ratifying the @entity24 , at no consequence to our own nuclear capabilities , the @entity2 further establishes an international norm that pressures @entity105 and @entity106 to ratify the treaty as well			1
we no longer need to test , but these states do in order to bridge their knowledge gaps			2
the success of new start exemplifies the kind of diplomatic leadership the @entity2 must embody			2
@entity2 became a reluctant global leader in the 20th century			0
but with global power comes global responsibility			0
thrust onto the world stage in periods that demanded leadership , we have seen the consequences of @entity2 reluctance to lead			2
the 21st century is a time of new challenges , be those challenges of economic , environmental or military nature			0
leadership does n't have to be expensive , and there are clear budgetary incentives for reducing our @entity51 nuclear arsenal			0
as commentators discuss the decline of @entity2 influence in the world , we must focus on the power of our example as a staple of international leadership and that means active participation in diplomatic processes and organizations			2
@entity2 firmly believe in their commitment to ideals , principles and morality			0
@entity3 is supremely representative of that			0
we should extend that commitment to ratification of the @entity24			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0

@entity170 : new start treaty has provided stability for the whole world
next step is ratifying the test ban treaty , he says , signed by @entity4 a decade *ago*
@entity170 : @entity2 no longer needs to test nuclear weapons ; threat today is homemade bombs
signing would help us in pressing rogue states to pledge not to test nukes , he writes
