@entity1 , @entity0 -- a political power struggle in @entity0 has intensified with media reports of the suspension of more than 10 police commanders who were part of a corruption probe that targeted suspects close to the @entity0 government			1
the suspensions came on wednesday -- a day after a wide sweeping corruption probe led to the detention of high profile businessmen , bureaucrats and the sons of three cabinet ministers in dawn raids on tuesday			1
some post changes were partly due to " administrative changes , " and others were a result of " investigation into allegations of misuse of office , " according to a statement released by the @entity0 police			1
the detentions on tuesday were seen by many as part of a political reckoning in @entity0 between @entity0 prime minister @entity33 and an @entity35 movement believed to control portions of the judiciary and the police			1
the @entity39 or @entity40 movement is led by @entity41 , an @entity42 cleric in self imposed exhile in @entity44			2
the more than 50 people detained follow three separate investigations that have been ongoing for more than a year , according to a written statement released by the @entity48			0
" allegations in two of the investigations include public servants accepting bribery and misuse of office , and are generally under the @entity56 and @entity57 and include as suspects some government workers as well as civilians , " the statement said			0
@entity33 has been critical of the raids which ensnared the sons of three cabinet ministers calling it a " a very very dirty operation			1
" he believes the operations are being led by gangs with connections abroad			0
" this has enthusiasts and planners abroad , and their extensions are in our country , " he told reporters on wednesday			0
" i am not going to elaborate on who they are ... you can guess who they are			0
as you know , there was a period started with gezi protests , they did n't achieve their goals then ... now they have taken a new step , " he said referring to anti-government demonstrations that began late last may over plans to build a shopping mall in @entity81			0
@entity41 has denied any involvement in the operations through a letter released by his legal representative in @entity0			1
" the esteemed @entity41 has neither the smallest interest or concern for these investigations and the public servants who are carrying them out , " said a statement issued by @entity41 's lawyer on thursday			1
the letter also responds to statements made by ruling @entity103 ( @entity103 ) members			0
" we would like to openly express the following : ' waging war against the government , ' ' starting an operation , ' ' playing dirty games , ' ' setting a trap , ' or ' cornering ' are only misdirection and are nothing more than imaginary malicious allegations , " the statement said			0
the sons of interior minister @entity115 , economy minister @entity116 and @entity117 and urban planning minister @entity118 were detained in the raids , according to local media			2
" we will always respect the judiciary			0
the governments support will always be behind the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister @entity122 in a speech but that " it is not right to convict the ministers or the other people named in this process in advance and to hold the government responsible			2
" concerning the removal of police commanders form office , @entity122 said , the chain of command of police procedure was not followed properly and resulted in the suspensions			0
there have been widespread press reports that the interior minister whose son was one of the detained in the raids , did not have prior knowdlege of the operation			0
" everyone was unaware of the operation started by the department head			0
you can keep the names a secret but share them with your supervisor			0
is there anything more tragic than the interior minister learning his son has been detained from the press , " said @entity122			0
police carried out dawn raids in @entity1 and @entity161 , according to local media , including the headquarters of @entity164 , a public bank that was alleged to play a role in sidelining sanctions on @entity167 in a gold for oil scheme last year			2
the head of a large construction company , @entity172 , was also brought in within the scope of the investigation though the ceo of the company later told @entity177 that @entity172 was not the focus of the investigation			0
local commentators and analysts see the raids as the most public confrontation of the developing rift between @entity33 's ruling party and supporters of @entity41 , an @entity42 cleric living in @entity44 whose loose network of followers are thought to hold key positions within the judiciary and police force			1
the @entity40 , the name preferred by @entity41 's followers , has in the past thrown its support behind the @entity103 led by @entity33 but the two have been publicly at odds over the last month			1
" it was a forced marriage and now it 's an ugly divorce , " said @entity197 , a journalist who wrote a book on @entity41 and his influence within the judiciary and the police force			2
last month @entity33 announced that he would shutdown college admission tutorial centers , a large source of revenue and recruitment opportunity for the @entity207			1
on monday , @entity208 , an ex-footballer and @entity39 follower , who was elected on the @entity103 party ticket to parliament resigned his membership in the party citing the governments stance on tutorial centers			2
" this is all a judicial process , it would not be right for me to say anything until the outcome , " @entity33 told reporters in @entity217			1
but in a fiery speech he delivered there he said " those who are receiving the support of financial circles and media can not change the direction of this country			1
those who are supported by dark circles from inside and outside the country can not change the direction of @entity0			1
" @entity0 is expected to hold local elections in 2014 and many analysts see this as a test of @entity33 's grip on power after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests			1
@entity2 's @entity240 contributed to this report .			2

analysts say the detentions show rift within @entity33 's party
ministers ' sons , a bank *president* , bureaucrats caught up in the sweep
@entity33 : those supported by " dark circles " can not change direction of @entity0
