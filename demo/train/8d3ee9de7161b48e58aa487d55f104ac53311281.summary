it was billed as a top of the table clash that would determine the fate of the @entity6 title			0
instead , saturday evening 's dull 1 - 1 draw between leaders @entity7 and current champions @entity8 did little more than preserve the status quo			1
@entity8 traveled to west @entity12 five points behind @entity7 , knowing that victory would take a large chunk out of that lead			1
also traveling was @entity8 's @entity17 , who until last season played for @entity7 and remains their record goal scorer			1
his controversial move to @entity8 , when it had been thought he had signed for @entity23 team @entity22 , had angered many @entity7 supporters , giving extra spice to the clash			1
but there was little drama in a largely benign encounter , with @entity7 showing signs of fatigue after their midweek exertions against @entity33 in the @entity34			1
cagey after a cagey opening half , the game did briefly come to life after @entity7 's @entity39 international striker @entity38 fired the home side into a lead which only lasted a few minutes			1
@entity8 quickly equalized when @entity43 international @entity42 converted after a rare mistake by @entity7 goalkeeper @entity45			1
@entity8 dominated the second half without creating any more clean cut chances			2
indeed , @entity7 would fail to register a single shot on target after their goal			2
the game did come to life again briefly when @entity17 came on as a late substitute			2
despite some boos , he was given a largely warm reception back at a club where he scored a record 211 goals in all competitions			0
but @entity17 could n't find the breakthrough either as the two teams shared the spoils			0
standing ovation " they had a big old game midweek , " @entity17 told @entity64 after the game , referring to wednesday 's match against @entity33			2
" it was a good performance all round without the electricity the big games need			0
@entity7 , i think , accepted the point			2
" after the game @entity17 was given a standing ovation from the home side , something he was denied before leaving in the close season			0
" it felt a bit strange and i was excited about today but a bit nervous too			0
i knew this would be different , " @entity17 said of his return			0
" i was delighted with the reception from both fans , " he added			0
" they [ @entity7 fans ] showed complete class by giving me an ovation at the end , which i did n't get a chance to see at the end of last season			2
" @entity95 gain earlier in the day @entity95 beat bottom of the table @entity98 3 - 1 , lifting them up to third			1
the reverse fixture last year was arguably coach @entity101 lowest moment in the job			0
his @entity95 team somehow conspired to turn a 3 - 1 lead into a 5 - 3 defeat but there was little chance of a repeat at @entity110			1
goals from @entity112 , @entity113 and an own goal by @entity115 before half time handed @entity95 an unassailable lead			0
@entity98 scored a consolation through @entity119 , but it was too late for the @entity122 club to mount another comeback			0
sturridge returns @entity33 maintained their recent run of good form with a 2 - 0 victory against @entity128			1
@entity128 have not won at @entity129 since 1963 -- a game in which @entity133 's 1966 @entity132 hero @entity131 scored twice -- so little was expected of the visiting side			0
@entity33 eventually took the lead through @entity136 but it was the return of striker @entity137 that had the @entity138 on their feet			1
with @entity140 now at @entity141 and @entity137 injured for much of the season , @entity33 have struggled for goals			1
but the @entity133 international scored shorty after coming on , giving @entity33 another boost in their efforts to secure a @entity148 spot			2
two of the teams in contention for fourth place in the league , @entity149 and @entity150 , play against @entity155 and @entity156 respectively on sunday .			0

@entity7 and @entity8 play out 1 - 1 draw
