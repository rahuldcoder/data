skype users soon will be able to expand the list of people they can connect with , says @entity4 , owner of the popular web - chat tool			1
still in its early stages of development , @entity10 , as it 's being called for now , will provide voice and text language translation for calls between people speaking different languages			1
@entity4 ceo @entity16 and @entity17 , the vice president in charge of @entity10 , demonstrated the technology tuesday night in @entity20 at the @entity21 , sponsored by tech - news site @entity23			1
" it is going to make sure you can communicate with anybody without language barriers , " @entity16 said at the gathering in suburban @entity25			1
" in fact , it 's the most human of things			0
" at the demo , @entity17 , speaking @entity33 , and a colleague speaking @entity35 conducted a @entity10 video call			1
there were a couple of instances when the voice and text translation mixed up minor parts of a sentence , but overall it appeared to be spot on			2
the conversation was no simple " hello , how are you ? " either			0
it centered on @entity17 's plans to move to @entity49 and included the names of streets and neighborhoods in that city as well as discussion of his colleague 's visits to @entity4 's headquarters in @entity58 , @entity59			1
the two would speak , then wait while the program translated what was just said			0
" it is early days for this technology , but the ' @entity67 ' vision for a @entity69 translator is n't a galaxy away , and its potential is every bit as exciting as those ' @entity67 ' examples , " @entity17 said in a blog post			2
" @entity10 opens up so many possibilities to make meaningful connections in ways you never could before in education , diplomacy , multilingual families and in business			2
" after a short delay , the system posts one user 's translated comments as text onscreen to the other user while a synthetic voice speaks them aloud			0
@entity17 said @entity10 will be available first as a @entity90 beta app by the end of this year			1
@entity4 purchased @entity49 - based @entity10 , which has 300 million monthly users , in 2011			1
but @entity16 said the translation technology the program uses has been in development at @entity4 for 15 years			1
and , in another development straight out of science fiction , he said the current version is surprising even its creators			2
" say you teach it @entity33			0
it learns @entity33 , " he said			0
" then you teach it @entity104			0
it learns @entity104 , but it becomes better at @entity33			0
and then you teach it @entity106			0
it gets good at @entity106 , but it gets great at both @entity104 and @entity33 -- and , quite frankly , none of us know exactly why			0
" it 's brain - like in the sense of its capability to learn			2

the heads of @entity4 and @entity10 show off a new language - translation tool
@entity10 lets speakers of different languages communicate with each other
@entity4 ceo @entity16 says the project is in its early stages
a beta version is expected out by the end of the year
