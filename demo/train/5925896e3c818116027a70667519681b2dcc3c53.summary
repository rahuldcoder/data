what motivated an @entity2 soldier to allegedly open fire and kill 16 innocent @entity5 civilians in cold blood ? no one knows at this point			1
the soldier , an @entity10 staff sergeant , seems to have acted alone , and he turned himself in to authorities after the shooting rampage			1
what we do know is that he had been injured in an accident while deployed to @entity16 in 2010			0
despite being diagnosed with traumatic brain injury , he was found fit for duty			1
it 's common for the military to evaluate service members for fitness for duty			2
the most important question asked is : can the soldier safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health or neuropsychological standpoint ? more than a million individuals suffer a traumatic brain injury each year in the @entity2			1
many of these people have experienced problems processing complex information			0
however , the execution - style killing of innocent people is not something that people with a traumatic brain injury would carry out			1
so while it 's possible that " brain damage " is a contributing factor , it is unlikely to explain the slayings			2
one convenient answer would be that he is a " bad apple , " he simply went temporarily insane			0
if that were the case , then no military leader or peer could have predicted the rampage			2
he is a rogue soldier who can plead insanity in the court of justice			2
the blame falls solely on him			0
however , one ca n't help but wonder whether the recent spate of events , including the desecration of @entity59 corpses by four @entity60 , the burning of the @entity62 by @entity2 troops , and now , the slaying of @entity5 civilians , point to the toll that the @entity5 war is taking			1
has the psychological impact of the long war been underestimated ? @entity5 , by any standard , is a tough terrain with complex politics and even more complex culture			1
the mental , emotional and physical burden on our troops is formidable			0
most of @entity5 's population is uneducated and illiterate , and held in terror by the @entity59 , who operate through threats , corruption , extortion , blackmail and intimidation			1
our troops must not only deal with the daily risks of attacks from the @entity59 , but also mistrust , unease or hostility from the @entity5			1
while @entity2 forces attempt to interact as much as possible with locals , the fact remains that they are foreigners who are mostly stationed on temporary bases , located far away from community centers and operate mostly on mission - based initiatives			2
@entity99 , of course , is always stressful			0
and the war in @entity5 is no exception			1
during the @entity99 , the stress associated with going to war was known as homesickness			0
during @entity108 , it was shell shock			0
after @entity111 , it was battle fatigue			0
during the @entity114 , a new term was coined -- @entity115			0
combat stress is now thought to be a normal reaction to the abnormal events encountered during war , including different rules of engagement , morale ups and downs , fatigue , sensory overload or extreme weather			2
anger toward the civilian community is also considered a symptom			0
the @entity2 military is not na√Øve to combat stress			1
much effort has been made to prepare troops for the symptoms of combat stress before deployment			1
once troops are deployed , they can be provided immediate assistance if problems arise and help is nearby			0
our military has been a technological leader in building better armored vehicles , using superior aerial surveillance via remotely operated drones and employing ever better laser - guided missiles			0
but the @entity147 should also emphasize an important nontechnological component in its military training : the need to include a better understanding of the crosscultural challenges that are likely to be encountered when troops are deployed into foreign combat zones like @entity5			1
as we learn more about the 38 - year - old married staff sergeant who is a qualified infantry sniper and serving his third deployment in the @entity157 , we have already learned one very painful lesson			0
namely , there is an expensive psychological cost to sending our men and women to war .			2

an @entity2 soldier allegedly went on a rampage and killed 16 @entity5 civilians
@entity169 : has psychological impact of @entity5 war been underestimated ?
he says the soldier 's horrific act can not be *attributed* solely to traumatic brain injury
@entity169 : our military must do more to prepare troops for challenges in combat zones
