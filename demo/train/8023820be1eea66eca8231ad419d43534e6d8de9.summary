-- actors call it " backstory			0
" @entity4 stars as the title character in " x-men origins : @entity7			1
" it 's all the stuff that happened in the past , before the movie begins			0
all the stuff that might explain how the character became what he or she is today			0
it 's obvious why that might be fascinating to the actor playing the role			0
but as for the rest of us , well , you have to figure the writer left it out for a reason			0
but these days we 're seeing a lot more " origin " stories as the studios milk each franchise for every last drop , and thus arrives " x-men origins : @entity7 , " about the blade - wielding character @entity4 plays			1
( @entity4 , no dummy , has a producer credit on the film			1
) you can be sure that someone at @entity36 will be running the numbers monday with a view to fast - tracking a sequel to this prequel , as well as further putative episodes devoted to @entity42 , @entity43 and the rest of the class of @entity46 based on " @entity7 , " it 's hard to get excited about the prospect			1
the film exhibits all the overly familiar hallmarks of the 21st - century comic book movie : an inflated sense of its own importance , turgid plotting and action sequences designed to showcase lavish @entity58 effects			1
in many ways , it was the first " x-men , " back in 2000 , that set the tone			2
on the one hand , director @entity63 embedded an earnest allegory about prejudice and minority rights ; on the other , it was an fx geek 's wet dream			0
each mutant came with her or his own gimmick : one could shapeshift ; another could levitate ; yet another had a bad case of wind			0
the mutants all shared the same nasty temper , but @entity7 / @entity7 ( @entity4 ) had the shortest fuse -- and the silliest haircut , a ' 50s ducktail with ferocious rockabilly sideburns			1
predictably enough , " origins " devotes more time to exploring the roots of his anger issues than his hair , but it does n't worry about where his most distinctive genetic features might have come from : the retractable claws that spring from his knuckles when he 's irked and his invulnerability to anything short of decapitation			2
in " @entity7 , " @entity7 has lost his taste for war in @entity98 after more than a century as a fighting man ( or mutant ) and finally walks away in disgust from the elite mutant unit put together by @entity103 ( @entity104 )			1
but his brother @entity105 ( @entity106 ) has other ideas and knows how to get @entity7 to embrace his true , animalistic , nature			1
borrowing wholesale from " @entity110 , " with @entity106 fairly effective in the @entity112 part , " @entity7 " struggles to establish an identity of its own			1
the two brothers charge at each other like medieval knights jousting , and @entity105 -- also known as @entity118 -- affects a dog - like , four - legged bound			2
but no matter how often he tries it , director @entity120 ( " @entity121 " ) never works out how to make a fight between indestructible foes tense or exciting			0
that 's the trouble with @entity127 - enhanced action : what you gain in spectacle , you lose in impact			2
filmmakers today can engineer destruction on a scale that would have been unimaginable 20 or 30 years ago , but it 's all so much collateral damage			0
it 's rare , these days , for an @entity137 action movie to impart any genuine sense of pain or hurt or loss			0
too much wow , not enough @entity141 ! in fairness , there are fleeting moments in " @entity7 " where we do feel @entity7 's emotional anguish			2
but they 're only as a prelude to his anger , which is the only quality an audience is likely to find interesting about him			0
serviceable but inescapably redundant , this " @entity7 " movie does just enough to keep the " x-men " franchise on life support , but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it 's going to escape @entity158			1
" x-men origins : @entity7 " is rated @entity160 and runs 108 minutes			1

" x-men origins : @entity7 " has all the *drawbacks* , none of heart of comic - book film
film has *wonderful* @entity58 effects , but to what end ?
star @entity4 tries hard , but script , pacing let him down
