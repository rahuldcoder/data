-- the incredible discovery of the @entity2 will open up new ways of probing the part of the universe that is invisible to our everyday senses : beyond ordinary matter , into the extraordinary world of dark matter			1
it is n't often that you get to be physically present at an historic occasion , but i was at @entity15 on july 4 when scientists at the @entity17 announced the discovery of the higgs boson particle			2
hundreds of young physicists had camped out from the previous night just to get good seats at the technical seminars proclaiming the discovery			0
what we witnessed was the first solid evidence for the particle that explains how other particles like electrons and quarks get to be massive			0
part of the excitement stems from the fact that the @entity2 is the final piece in an extremely elaborate puzzle : the @entity35 of particle physics			2
this boringly named theory has loomed triumphantly over physics for the past 40 years , withstanding all experimental challenges			0
with this final piece in place , we can justifiably say that we understand the behavior of ordinary matter -- the atoms and molecules that make up ourselves and our everyday world			1
much more of the excitement , however , had a deeper basis : if the @entity2 is the final chapter in one story , it 's also the prologue to our next adventure			2
this is true literally as well as figuratively			0
see also : what is the @entity2 and why is it important ? as successful as the @entity35 has been , we know it 's not the final answer to how the universe works			2
strong evidence comes from the existence of dark matter : mysterious , invisible stuff that adds up to five times as much mass as the ordinary atoms and particles in the universe			1
we know enough about dark matter to be sure that it 's not just some kind of ordinary matter that is hiding in the shadows			1
it is something truly new , something we have n't yet directly seen here on @entity76			0
multiple experiments are underway to look for the dark matter particles we think are all around us			1
not only are they " dark , " these particles hardly interact with ordinary matter at all			1
it 's possible , even likely , that millions of them pass through your body every second			0
it 's like a city with two populations , each speaking a different language , and no translators or bilingual interpreters			0
the two groups of people go about their separate lives , never directly speaking with each other			0
likewise , in our galaxy , dark matter and ordinary matter pass right through each other all the time			1
the @entity2 could be the bilingual particle we 've been looking for			2
we do n't know exactly what the dark matter is , but we certainly have our favorite theories			1
in many of those models , the @entity2 is the one particle that readily interacts both with ordinary protons and neutrons and also with dark matter			1
see also : the woman at the edge of physics there are several experiments currently running with the goal of detecting dark matter			1
typically they are deep underground , shielded from cosmic rays and other sources of noise , kept in environments that are as quiet as possible			0
dark matter particles are able to penetrate through the @entity76 and pass right through the detector			1
most do so unmolested , but occasionally we 'll get lucky and one will interact with the nucleus of an atom , leaving a bit of energy behind			0
our best theoretical guess is that the way that interaction will happen is through the exchange of @entity2 bosons			2
knowing something about the @entity2 will be enormously helpful in figuring out the implications if one of these experiments finds a strong dark - matter signal -- something we 're hopeful could happen in the near future			1
we 're not just waiting around for dark matter to be detected , either			2
now that we 've found the @entity2 , we can start studying its properties in detail			0
how is it made ? how does it decay ? are its properties those predicted by the @entity35 , or are there hints of something new going on ? if everything breaks just right , we may be able to produce dark matter directly at the @entity17			1
it wo n't be easy , precisely because dark matter interacts so weakly			2
even if you make it , it 's hard to be sure , because the antisocial dark matter particles tend to zip out of your experiment without leaving any trace behind			1
but once we better understand the @entity2 and the particles it decays into , we might be able to infer the presence of dark matter just by process of elimination , by pinpointing events in which more energy went into the collision than we detected coming out			1
even though it was n't discovered until 2012 , the @entity2 was proposed back in 1964			0
it is very much a child of the 20th century			0
in particle physics and cosmology , the 21st century promises discoveries that will help illuminate the dark universe around us			0
that 's the great thing about history being made : you know things are different now , but you ca n't be sure where you 're going to go next			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

discovery of @entity2 can help us find dark matter particles , says physicist @entity185
dark matter is mysterious , invisible and passes through ordinary matter
@entity2 could interact both with ordinary protons and neutrons and also with dark matter
@entity185 says it may be possible to produce dark matter at the @entity17
