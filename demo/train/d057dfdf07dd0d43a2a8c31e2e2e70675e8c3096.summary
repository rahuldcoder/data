' rare opportunity to escape ' the female hostages escaped friday while their captors left their camp to launch an attack against the military and police in the nearby town of @entity66 , said @entity67 , a local vigilante fighting @entity2 in @entity68			1
soldiers overwhelmed the insurgents , forcing them to mobilize all their men and leave the abducted women in the camp , @entity67 said			2
" the women seized that rare opportunity to escape when they realized they were alone in the camp , " @entity67 said			0
" but we still have five women , including a nursing mother , missing			0
" news of the escape was slow to emerge due to trouble with telecommunication towers in the area damaged by previous @entity2 attacks			2

but the radical militant group does not consider all muslims as supporters and allies			0
@entity2 has allegedly killed @entity33 clerics who have dared to criticize the group			0
