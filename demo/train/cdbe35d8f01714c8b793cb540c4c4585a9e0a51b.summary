@entity0 -- the tragic death of president @entity3 and @entity5 's political and military elite among the trees of the @entity7 is surreal , given that in those same woods , thousands of @entity5 prisoners of war were murdered by @entity12 's secret police			1
the delegation was headed for the @entity7 near @entity14 , @entity15 , to honor the 22,000 @entity5 prisoners of war killed 70 years ago by the @entity19 's @entity18 , forerunner of the @entity20			1
in 1940 , @entity12 ordered the assassination of @entity5 's military and political leaders in order to create a leadership vacuum so he could prop up a @entity27 puppet state in @entity28			1
many of those killed in saturday 's plane crash helped to overturn @entity32 in @entity5 in 1990			1
they included @entity5 's top generals , several bishops , the head of the national bank and several deputy government ministers			0
during the five decades of @entity19 occupation of @entity5 in the @entity39 , the @entity15 covered up the @entity7 , claiming that @entity40 had murdered these officers			1
but forensic evidence found in mass graves proved that the @entity5 prisoners were taken into the woods , with their hands tied behind their backs , and one by one , they were shot dead in the back of the head by the @entity15			1
the mass graves were discovered by @entity52 soldiers in 1943 when they saw pawprints of wolves that had been digging up the bones			0
in 1990 , after the collapse of the @entity19 , the truth began to slowly emerge with revelations by @entity15 leaders @entity60 and @entity61			1
it 's no secret that @entity63 was not excited about @entity3 's visit to @entity65 , because he demanded to know the full truth about the murders			2
for the @entity69 , the official commemoration took place last wednesday when @entity15 prime minister @entity71 and @entity3 's political rival , @entity5 prime minister @entity72 , took part in ceremonies at the same gravesite where @entity3 was heading			2
but @entity3 's delegation included family members of murdered officers who wanted the @entity15 government to open all of the remaining archives concerning the massacre			2
for decades , the cries of @entity5 families who want to know what happened to their loved ones have fallen on deaf ears			0
many will no doubt compare this crash to the 1943 death of @entity5 prime minister gen. @entity92 , who died mysteriously when his plane crashed into the sea near @entity95 after he asked the @entity96 to investigate the @entity7			1
at the time , the @entity98 and @entity99 governments were not willing to address the massacre because they were trying to help the @entity19 fight @entity40 on the eastern front			2
let us hope the flight data recordings from @entity3 's downed plane will provide enough evidence to dissuade conspiracy theorists			0
ironically , because of @entity3 's death , more people have already heard about the @entity7 than would have heard about it had he simply placed a wreath at the gravesite			0
for those @entity5 officers in the mass graves at @entity65 , @entity3 's death was not in vain			0
many @entity15 government officials appeared on @entity5 television after the disaster expressing sincere regrets over the death of @entity3 and his delegation			2
@entity71 has flown to @entity14 , where he said that he would oversee the investigation into the crash			0
hopefully , these are signs that this tragedy will somehow lead to the full truth about @entity65 and reconciliation between @entity5 and @entity15			1
for decades , @entity65 has been the symbol of the worst in @entity5 - @entity15 relations			2
that is why several months ago , the @entity132 began working on a conference about the @entity7 to be held at the @entity134 on may 5			0
the goal is to provide a forum for political leaders , scholars , authors and human rights advocates from @entity5 , @entity15 and the @entity98 to discuss new details on the massacre , and the possibility of finding a path toward reconciliation between @entity5 and @entity15			1
there will also be a display of rare @entity65 photographs and documents on loan from @entity151 to protect the memory of @entity153 and @entity154			0
@entity155 , @entity156 , was to be one of the speakers			0
he died in saturday 's crash			0
now , this conference and exhibit will be a tribute to him , as well as to the other @entity5 leaders killed in @entity65 during the 1940s , and in 2010			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

plane crash killed many @entity5 leaders headed to commemorate @entity7
@entity168 says the massacre by @entity19 in 1940 remains a source of *friction*
@entity5 president , killed in crash , was voice of those who wanted to know about the massacre
@entity168 hopes for reconciliation for @entity15 and @entity5 still seeking full truth
