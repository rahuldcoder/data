@entity0 , @entity1 " @entity9 " is only 15 , smiling as she greets and welcomes us into her family 's tent inside the @entity8 refugee camp in northwest @entity1			1
their faces , with their weathered skin and deep lines , speak of a difficult life that has just become much harder			2
blankets and mattresses are stacked up on one side , except for a few that we sit on while a small fan gently whirls , creating a slight breeze in the stifling heat			2
the refugee camp , outside the town of @entity0 , was created just last month by the @entity25 for the massive influx of @entity27 fleeing their homes in @entity29 from the @entity31 onslaught			1
i ask @entity33 if she will tell us her story			1
she nods and then looks at her elderly parents and asks them to leave the tent			0
she does n't want them to hear what she 's about to say			2
six weeks ago the family piled into their neighbor 's car in the early morning hours			2
they heard @entity31 was coming and they were desperately trying to escape from their home in @entity29			1
they got on the road , but a convoy of vehicles with black flags flying drove past them			0
they thought they had got away until minutes later when at least seven @entity31 vehicles appeared on the road , surrounding them			1
" they forced us out of the car , " said @entity33			1
" the girls and women were separated from the men including my 19 - year - old brother			1
but they only took the girls forcing us into a minivan			2
" horrific conditions from @entity29 , @entity33 , her 14 - year - old sister - in - law and a handful of other girls were driven 120 kilometers to the @entity31 stronghold of @entity72 -- @entity1 's second largest city captured by militants back in june			1
they were taken to a three - story house where they were locked with dozens of other teenage girls who 'd been captured			1
" in @entity72 they tried to make us change our faith and religion , " she said			0
" they said to us , ' read our quran			0
' a couple of the girls said , ' we never went to school - we ca n't read			1
' i could n't understand the @entity85			0
" for more than three weeks , @entity33 stayed here under horrific conditions			1
during this time , a sheik came and collected 20 girls including her 14 - year - old sister - in - law			1
" he forced himself on her			0
a lot of my friends were raped			0
it 's hard to talk about it			2
" sexual abuse is a taboo subject in this culture and to admit being a victim is unheard of			1
i gently ask @entity33 if she was also raped			1
she looks straight ahead , staring at the wall and shakes her head			0
it 's clear the teenager has been visibly traumatized			2
" i see their faces all the time , " @entity33 said			1
i ca n't stop thinking about how they forced themselves onto the girls			2
i have seen and been through too much			0
" shame @entity113 , @entity114 director , explains how difficult it is for girls like @entity9 to talk about what has happened to them			1
" even if these girls and women are released i think it 's impossible for them to talk about their painful ordeal			1
and they 're from a society , a culture that does not accept what this means for the family			0
it brings so much shame so they just do n't talk about it			0
" @entity33 and her friend were then taken to @entity133 by two @entity31 militants she calls @entity135 and @entity136			1
" they were really filthy			0
they had long beards ; they were really tall and big			0
even men would be scared of them			0
they forced us to marry them , threatening to hurt us if we did n't			0
they gave us a phone to call our families to tell them we 'd converted			0
" using this phone , they secretly called her friend 's uncle who knew people in @entity133 who were prepared to help			2
when the militants left the house , the girls - dressed in niqabs -- escaped			1
" my friend and i thought about killing ourselves			0
but we decided to ask my friend 's uncle for help to escape			1
he had friends living in @entity133 , but they could n't come to the house and rescue us , so we broke the door , put on veils , and walked for about an hour and met at a place where my friend 's uncle 's friends were waiting for us			2
they took us to a safe house in @entity133			0
" but when she was reunited with her family in this refugee camp , she suffered once again			0
" i did n't know that my brother had been killed			1
that made me very sad			0
i only had one brother			2
he was only married for six months			0
i was sad to hear this			0
they killed him and other men when they took me			2
they shot him in the head			0
my mother slept next to my brother 's body all night			1
" @entity9 does n't want to stay at the camp			1
everyone knows what happened to her and she says they gossip and look at her whenever she goes outside			0
but her shame is dwarfed by her guilt after learning what happened to the other girls once @entity31 discovered they 'd fled			1
" they raped them because we escaped			0
they tightened security so no girls can escape anymore			1
" i have to live with that			0

15 - year - old @entity33 's *hometown* in @entity1 was attacked by @entity31
@entity33 was captured and held with other girls
@entity9 managed to escape , but learns her brother was killed by @entity31
sexual violence remains a tool of war for @entity31 , but a taboo
