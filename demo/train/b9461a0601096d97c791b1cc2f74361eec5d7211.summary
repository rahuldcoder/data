the statue is part of the ancient @entity11 in the @entity12 , a quiet , spiritual place that 's very important to @entity5 's @entity14			1
but these days , there is a gruesome sight at the feet of the statue of @entity1 the savior			2
about 30 mutilated and charred bodies lie in piles near a footpath that leads to the monastery			0
the dead are rebel fighters who tried to storm the monastery but were killed as they advanced , @entity5 's government says			1

but @entity80 was recently invaded by @entity82 - linked militants of the @entity84 rebels			0
nuns were kidnapped and have yet to be released			0
