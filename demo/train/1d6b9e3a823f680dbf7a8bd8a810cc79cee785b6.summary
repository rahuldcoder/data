-- the body that represents @entity3 's professional footballers says it still has work to do to enable gay footballers to come out while still playing the game			1
@entity6 , the deputy chief executive of the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , was speaking after @entity8 , who quit the sport on the day he revealed his homosexuality last month , said it was " impossible to come out " while still playing			1
in his first media interview since , @entity8 -- a former @entity12 international who was playing in the @entity15 earlier this season -- admitted concerns about how both the dressing room and fans would react to news of an openly gay player			1
having played for third tier @entity24 on loan earlier this season , the 25 - year - old was released by parent club @entity28 in january , days before retiring from football when coming out through his personal website on february 18			2
" i think the @entity7 -- along with all the stakeholders -- have a responsibility to perhaps redouble our efforts if players do not feel that enough is being done , " @entity6 told @entity0			1
" i think football has tried hard to create an environment where there is a supportive network around a player should he decide to come out as a gay			1
" nonetheless , @entity8 did not feel the environment was conducive to staying in the @entity3 game after his announcement and says he would have found it hard to come out at any global club -- after being asked whether he could have done so during a 2007 - 2011 stint with @entity49 side @entity48			1
" no. not at any club -- anywhere , " @entity8 told @entity3 's @entity51 newspaper			1
@entity8 is only the second footballer in @entity3 to have come out , with @entity54 -- the first Â £ 1 million black player in the country 's football history -- having tragically committed suicide in 1998 , eight years after revealing his sexuality while still a professional			1
at present , @entity61 - based @entity60 is the only openly gay footballer although other sportsmen have come out in different disciplines , such as @entity65 boxer @entity64 , @entity67 rugby player @entity66 and @entity3 cricketer @entity68			1
in a wide - ranging interview , @entity8 revealed the internal strife he went through when trying to reconcile his love of playing football for a living with his desire to be honest with those closest to him			1
view : gallery of openly gay athletes after @entity48 won the @entity78 in 2008 , what should have been a night of collaborative celebration for the winger -- who won 18 caps with the @entity12 while also representing his nation at the @entity83 -- turned to individual torment instead			1
" we won that trophy in @entity87 , in front of my family , with this amazing team			0
afterwards we went to a bar and i was like , ' i should be so happy now ... ' , " @entity8 recalled			2
" but i left after a few drinks and sat on my own in my room , thinking , ' ok			0
but i ca n't come out because i love football so much			2
what am i going to do ? ' " " the more successful you become , the harder it is to step away			2
" yet that is precisely what he did , despite being at an age where he had yet to reach his peak , with most footballers performing best in their late 20 's			2
@entity6 , who believes that @entity8 ' revelation received a positive response all round , with " nothing negative " , feels the @entity12 may have been pleasantly surprised had he felt empowered enough to continue in the game after his announcement			1
" i do n't think he tested the water as such -- in that he had already made his decision to quit when the announcement was made -- but i hope he would have found a much more supportive arena , " he said			0
" i think the attitude now is far more : ' a player is gay , so what ? ' we do n't see it as a major issue and i do not believe players do either			2
" the big concern , i feel , is the negativity that players might receive from the terraces			2
" @entity8 , who says he was 14 - 15 when he realized he was gay and who sometimes dated girls as a cover for his sexuality , did have concerns about his teammates however , in addition to those about supporters			1
" maybe a lot of fans are n't homophobic			0
but , in a stadium , sometimes they want to destroy you , " he said			0
" i was very fearful how my teammates were going to react			0
was it going to change them ? even though i 'd still be the same person would it change the way they acted towards me -- when we were in the dressing room or the bus ? " even if he has yet to hear from another gay footballer in the game , @entity8 has been so inundated with support from fellow players and the public that he has mixed feelings on his future			1
" about a month ago i would 've thought : ' i do n't want to be a spokesman for gay footballers			2
' i have so many different things i 'm interested in			0
" but after thousands of emails , i 'm thinking , ok , how can i help others ? how can i make some positive change ? how am i going to reach young @entity8 and tell him to be himself ? " he might not fit the gay or football stereotype			1
that 's one thing i definitely want to do -- break some barriers and kill some stereotypes			0
" and most intriguingly , a man who is weighing up a career in fashion and who co-owns a clothing label ( @entity176 ) is finding himself being seduced by an old flame -- his former profession itself			0
" @entity180 will always be part of me			0
i do n't know if i 'm done playing yet			0
i might ask [ the coach ] @entity183 if i can train with @entity184 -- we 'll see			0
i miss it and think about it a lot			0
" but i 'm so happy now i do n't want to mess with that			0
football was my life and maybe i 'll need to go back ... or maybe i 'll just be a fan			0
but it 's an industry where there are lots of problems -- from sketchy agents to homophobic culture			0
