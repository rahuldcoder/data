-- the indictment and possible trial of @entity4 gov. @entity3 for allegedly applying illegal coercion to a district attorney will complicate -- but not kill -- his all - but - certain run for president in 2016			1
it 's a sure bet that voters outside of @entity4 will forgive , ignore or overlook any outcome short of a conviction			0
@entity3 would n't be the first modern presidential candidate to hit the trail with a scandal clanging in the background like noisy cans tied to the back of his campaign bus			1
but history suggests that a messy local political scene , with all its feuds and ethical shenanigans , is rarely a deal breaker on the national stage			0
most biographies of @entity29 , for example , focus on his stature as the architect of labor reforms and major @entity34 programs such as @entity35 , the @entity36 and the @entity37			2
few of the official histories note that @entity29 's career began as an opponent -- and later , a staunch ally -- of the famously corrupt @entity43 hierarchy in @entity44 , centered at @entity45 , a clubhouse whose members freely trafficked in bribes , kickbacks , rigged government contracts and stolen elections			1
" @entity29 , in the end , came to @entity54			2
@entity54 did not come to him , " writes @entity55 , author of " @entity58 , " a masterly work on the history of @entity45			0
years later , as president , @entity29 confided to a friend that " tens of thousands of people are members of @entity45			1
i do not think they are all objectionable for that reason ! " that fundamental truth -- that local political machines , whatever their ethical shortcomings , are indispensable when it comes to winning elections -- was equally true for @entity29 's vice president and successor , @entity72 , who hailed from an even more flamboyantly corrupt political machine in @entity74 , @entity75			1
the city machine was run by a notorious leader , " @entity77 , whose reign ended with a stint in federal prison			0
@entity72 never renounced his early patron , and attended @entity83 's funeral days after being sworn in as vice president			2
it 's tempting to think " that was then , this is now " since @entity29 and @entity72 operated in the days before television brought politics into nearly every @entity91 home			1
but consider what happened when -- decades before @entity93 -- @entity94 weathered a scandal shortly after being named running mate to @entity97 in 1952			0
journalists had discovered that the then - senator accepted money and personal gifts from a campaign fund financed by group of conservative businessmen , leading to widespread calls for @entity94 to resign from the @entity107 ticket			0
typical of the negative tone was one paper , the @entity110 , that blasted @entity94 as " the pet and @entity112 © , the subsidized front man " for a " special interest group of rich @entity115			0
" @entity94 answered the critics by seizing upon the still - new technology of television to deliver what 's now known as the " @entity121 " speech			2
( @entity94 , staring into the cameras , said the only personal gift he 'd received from the fund was a beloved dog , @entity121 , that he had no intention of selling or returning			0
) @entity94 also asked for -- and received -- a popular wave of calls from voters to @entity107 officials telling them to leave @entity94 alone			0
the @entity121 speech , delivered to what was then the largest broadcast audience in history , not only showed the power of a direct appeal to the people , it also demonstrated the public 's ability to look beyond the sometimes tawdry details of local politics and focus on the major issues of the day			0
voters accepted @entity144 as a vice president and later president despite widespread rumors that his election to the @entity149 in 1948 by a razor - thin , 87 - vote margin was stolen with the help of corrupt @entity4 political bosses -- charges confirmed decades after the fact by biographer @entity155			1
and in 1992 when it turned out that presidential candidate @entity157 and his wife , @entity158 , had ties to an ethically stinky , failed land development deal called @entity161 , voters shrugged it off and made him leader of the free world			0
no matter how much outrage @entity157 's enemies tried to stir up over @entity161 , it never took hold with the voting public , which returned @entity157 to the presidency for a second term			0
this is not to suggest that @entity3 's local troubles wo n't have a national impact			1
his indictment may scare away some potential supporters , making it harder for him to line up donations and early political support in this crucial pre-election season			2
and a conviction -- highly unlikely but possible -- would surely end @entity3 's presidential hopes			1
but the mere fact of a local political squabble casting a shadow on @entity3 's image ultimately wo n't automatically knock him out of the running			1
far more important will be avoiding debate gaffes such as the famous " oops " incident in 2012 and making headway in early presidential states such as @entity191 and @entity192 , where @entity3 is currently mired in single digits in the polls			2
it may not be much comfort to his supporters , but from the standpoint of presidential politics , @entity3 is pretty much the same candidate he was before the legal papers got served : a long shot with a tough road ahead of him .			1

@entity206 : @entity3 's indictment will complicate , not kill , his chances in 2016
he says candidates like @entity144 , @entity29 have run for president before while trailing scandal
political machines are indispensable to winning elections , he says
louis : @entity3 likely to remain the same long - shot candidate he was before being indicted
