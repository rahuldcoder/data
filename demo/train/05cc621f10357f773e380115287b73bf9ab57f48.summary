@entity0 -- the @entity2 said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to @entity8 attacked @entity2 diplomatic compounds in @entity10 and @entity11 on tuesday , killing an @entity2			1
in @entity0 , several men scaled the walls of the @entity14 and tore down its @entity2 flag , according to @entity1 producer @entity16 , who was on the scene			1
in @entity10 , witnesses say members of a radical @entity21 group called @entity22 protested near the @entity2 @entity23 in @entity24 , where @entity26 jets established no - fly zones last year to blunt ground attacks from then @entity10 strongman @entity29			1
the group then clashed with security forces in the city , blocking roads leading to the consulate , witnesses said			2
a @entity37 officer was killed in the violence in @entity24 , secretary of state @entity35 said in a statement late tuesday			1
" we are heartbroken by this terrible loss , " @entity40 said			1
" our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack			2
" @entity40 said that she condemned the attack on the @entity2 facilities " in the strongest terms " and that following tuesday 's events , the @entity2 government was " working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel , our missions and @entity2 citizens worldwide			1
" @entity10 's @entity59 also condemned the attack , saying it " led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals			1
" lawmakers said in a statement tuesday night that they were investigating			2
it was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated , @entity1 national security contributor @entity66 said tuesday night			0
" one such breach of an embassy or consulate 's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news			0
... the fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where @entity2 are remembering those that we lost , you have to ask yourself , what are @entity2 officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related ? " she asked			1
in @entity11 , police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the @entity92 in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing , but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the @entity2 compound			1
the black flag , which hangs in full view from inside the complex , is adorned with white characters that read , " there is no @entity104 but @entity105 and @entity106 is his messenger , " an emblem often used by @entity8 radicals			0
a volley of warning shots were fired , as a large crowd gathered around the compound , although it is not clear who fired the shots			0
are you there ? share your images and videos			0
@entity11 groups point to @entity2 websites , including @entity121 , that have scenes from the film			1
some anti-muslim blogs also have flagged the movie			0
in a series of disjointed scenes , the film depicts @entity106 as a child molester , womanizer and ruthless killer			2
the movie was made by @entity133 , an @entity134 - @entity2 real - estate developer , according to the @entity135			1
@entity133 -- who wrote , directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of @entity8 as a hateful religion , the @entity135 reported , citing a telephone interview with him			1
@entity133 , 52 , told the newspaper that to make the film , he had raised $ 5 million from about 100 @entity143 donors , who he declined to identify			2
he said he made the two - hour movie over a three - month period last year in @entity145 , using about 60 actors and 45 crew members , the @entity135 reported			1
most of the @entity8 world considers depictions of @entity106 to be blasphemous and deeply offensive			0
" some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the @entity155 , " @entity40 said			1
" the @entity2 deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others			1
our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation			0
" but she stressed that " there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind			0
" @entity14 officials issued a warning to @entity2 in @entity11 , telling them to avoid the demonstrations which " may gather in front of the @entity2 embassy , or @entity11 government buildings such as the @entity175 and @entity176			1
" " it is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets , but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another , " the @entity2 @entity14 said in a statement			1
" large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and @entity188 should be avoided this afternoon			0
" frenzied protesters could been seen tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded @entity2 flag to television camera crews while chanting anti- @entity2 slogans			1
an embassy phone operator told @entity1 that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day ahead of the apparent threat , while @entity11 riot police and the army were called in			0
" this is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult , " said @entity200 , a spokesman for the @entity201			0
" but events like this are extremely deplorable			0
and we have to work to get things under control			0
" the @entity210 issued a statement tuesday , pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests ' potentially debilitating effects on the @entity11 economy			2
" there are police forces at the demonstrations , " @entity200 said			0
" they should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave			0
" several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations tuesday , including @entity227 leader @entity226 , who is president of @entity11 's conservative @entity229 television channel			0
@entity230 -- the brother of @entity232 leader @entity231 -- added , " we called for the peaceful protest joined by different @entity8 factions including the @entity235 ( and the ) @entity237 movement			0
" " we were surprised to see the big numbers show up , including the soccer @entity240 fans , " he said			0
" i just want to say , how would the @entity2 feel if films insulting leading @entity244 figures like the pope or historical figures like @entity247 were produced ? " he added that " the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner , alluding to topics like sex , which is not acceptable			1
" the @entity2 @entity14 in @entity0 announced that it had canceled visa services for wednesday			1
it also said in a statement that it " condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of @entity258 -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions			0
" " respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of @entity2 democracy , " the statement said			1
" we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others			0
" the embassy statement set off a political spat back in the @entity2 after the @entity277 presidential nominee , @entity276 , criticized its message and linked it to his opponent for the @entity280			1
" it 's disgraceful that the @entity284 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks , " @entity276 said in a statement released late tuesday			1
he said he was " outraged " by the attacks in @entity10 and @entity11			2
the @entity291 campaign quickly responded to @entity276 's comments			1
" we are shocked that , at a time when the @entity2 is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in @entity10 , governor @entity276 would choose to launch a political attack , " @entity293 , an @entity291 campaign spokesman said in an email			1
demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the @entity11 street , where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former @entity11 president @entity308			0
this summer , @entity11 's first @entity21 president , @entity309 , was sworn into power at @entity311 , the scene of the nation 's revolution in 2011			0
though tuesday 's embassy protests are the first that @entity309 has dealt with , @entity11 recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the @entity134 and @entity320 embassies in unrelated episodes			2
" these protests are a bad image for @entity11 , " said a @entity0 street vendor named @entity323			0
" of course i 'm against insulting @entity8 , but it 's the undereducated , poor people who are out here causing problems			2
" " all i want for @entity11 is security and stability , " he said			0
" and as you can see this is n't it			0
" the incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the @entity2 in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead			2
tuesday 's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an @entity351 @entity350 lawmaker to portray @entity8 as a violent religion			2
@entity354 ' film " @entity355 , " which he released online , featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the @entity359			2
report : @entity11 's ex-pm @entity361 faces arrest , extradition order @entity11 kills militants , seizes weapons in @entity367 offensive @entity2 companies eye @entity11 for investment @entity1 's @entity371 in @entity0 , @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 and @entity377 contributed to this report			2

new : the film causing the furor is made by an @entity134 - @entity2 , the @entity135 reports
@entity276 and @entity291 campaigns argue over response to the violence
a @entity37 officer is killed in @entity10 , the @entity2 says
@entity40 says the @entity2 is working to protect its citizens worldwide
