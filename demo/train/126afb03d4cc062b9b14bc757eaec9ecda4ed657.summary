@entity0 , @entity1 -- something interesting is happening in the @entity4 , and it 's not the unexpected rise of @entity6 and his 9 - 9 - 9 plan			1
the really significant development is the resilience @entity10 is showing as a top - tier candidate			2
ironically , @entity10 , the candidate who seems to generate the least excitement among @entity4 voters -- the candidate by default -- potentially could have the most far - reaching impact on the character of the @entity4			1
following almost half a century when the heart of the @entity4 moved toward the @entity20 of the country , a @entity18 @entity4 remains the likely frontrunner for the nomination			1
it is unlikely that @entity6 , who barely has a campaign organization to speak of , will last very long at the top of the polls			0
even as @entity29 gov. @entity28 is trying hard to steal his thunder , @entity10 has been able to stay ahead of most of his opponents			2
upon giving @entity10 his endorsement , @entity1 gov. @entity32 , another part of the new generation of republicans from the region , said : " the @entity35 are sticking together in this case			2
" if @entity10 wins the nomination , he would place the @entity41 wing of the party in a position where it has not been since the 1960s			1
there was a time when @entity48 , many of whom were relatively liberal , loomed large in the @entity4			1
politicians such as sens. @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , as well as @entity57 gov. @entity56 , championed a style of conservatism that stressed fiscal and regulatory issues over social and cultural questions			0
they tended to be more sensitive to issues such as urban revitalization and public transportation that were central to their constituencies			0
rather than fighting for all or nothing on government policies they disliked , their goal was to constrain and direct domestic programs			0
this was a breed of @entity4 that had to survive in heavily @entity76 states , so they understood the art of compromise and learned to work within divided political systems			2
standing before hostile @entity4 delegates who were trying to boo him off the stage at the 1964 convention ( when @entity4 shifted right by nominating @entity85 ) , @entity56 warned that he had " crisscrossed this nation " in order to fight to " keep the @entity4 the party of all the people ... and warning of the extremist threat , its danger to the party , and danger to the nation			1
" republicans gained strength in the @entity20 and @entity98			1
@entity76 took over the coastal states , succeeding in the @entity100 , where suburban voters were more liberal on social and cultural issues , and where unions still remained an important force			0
when @entity108 won the @entity76 nomination in 1976 and @entity110 in 1992 , a big part of their promise was to strengthen @entity76 in the @entity20 , a region that the party had been losing ever since president @entity112 finished his term in the late 1960s			1
@entity119 's " @entity118 strategy " was designed for @entity4 to capitalize on southern discontent with @entity76 following the passage of the @entity116			2
in the @entity124 , @entity18 republicans such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 began to seem like anomalies			0
if @entity10 wins the nomination , and possibly the presidency , he would likely bring a different sensibility to his party			1
@entity10 was born and bred in a region where surviving as a @entity4 required a different approach than in a place like @entity134			1
as governor he famously tackled issues such as health care , accepted the need for government to raise revenue , and took a middling course on issues like abortion			0
playing to the center is part of a family tradition			0
in 1968 , one of the front - runners for the @entity4 nomination was @entity10 's father , gov. @entity147 of @entity150 , former ceo of @entity151			1
@entity10 , like his son dashing in his appearance , brought many of the same political benefits to the table in an era when @entity4 still held a place for the center			1
as far as @entity76 were concerned , he was seen as a dangerous @entity4 because he could appeal to centrist and independent voters , and even to disaffected @entity76			0
he was able to win some union support and endorsed the cause of civil rights			0
@entity147 's campaign imploded because of a statement about his trip to @entity167 , where he said he had been brainwashed by the military			0
the statement created media fodder to question @entity10 's stability			0
right now , many @entity4 reluctantly see @entity10 as the best possible option for the party			1
but in certain respects , he might be the most interesting one as well			0
without losing the support of the kind of right - wing conservatives who wo n't go to the @entity76 , his candidacy offers the @entity4 the opportunity to tackle issues and policies that have been ignored ever since @entity56 's generation disappeared from the electoral map			2
whether @entity4 voters have the confidence to take a risk on a candidate who provides a different perspective than @entity118 and @entity189 @entity4 remains to be seen			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

@entity192 : if @entity10 gets @entity4 nomination , it would signal change for party
in past 50 years , @entity4 has shifted to @entity20 and @entity98 , away from @entity199
@entity192 : @entity201 made up a moderate , even liberal wing of @entity4 in mid- 20th century
@entity10 represents the return of @entity18 perspective to @entity4 , @entity192 says
