he was only a kid , a 15 - year - old with braces , when he first dove into the @entity3 spotlight			1
he did n't win any medal at the @entity5 , but he gave fans a tiny glimpse of what was to come when he swam the last 50 meters of the 200 - meter butterfly faster than anyone else in the pool			1
he moved from eighth to fifth and moved from side note to talking point just like that			2
his teammate @entity16 told reporters at those 2000 games , " he 's a true competitor , and he 's going to be one of the greats			2
" @entity16 likely meant swimming great			1
but did anyone expect the long , lean teenager from @entity24 to grow up to be possibly the greatest olympian in history ? @entity27 extends record breaking spree with first individual gold in @entity30 on tuesday , @entity27 won his 19th @entity3 medal , more than many countries have ever won			1
and with a gold on thursday he moved his overall total to 20 -- 16 gold , two silver and two bronze medals			1
" it 's a combination of everything , " he told reporters last week on how he became the biggest name in swimming			0
" you have to have a great work ethic			1
have a strong mind , be motivated			0
there are so many things that come into it			0
" i have a decent package so i ca n't complain			0
" the @entity52 has been a world power in swimming since the days of @entity54 , but @entity27 has elevated its status like no other @entity52 competitor			1
@entity27 talks idols , mistakes and his future @entity61 once broadcast the world championships live , a rarity for the sport , because @entity27 was so popular			2
he was the first swimmer to win @entity67 's @entity66			2
after every @entity68 the number of swimmers increases , but when @entity27 won eight gold medals in an electrifying eight days in @entity72 in 2008 , it grew exponentially more than previous post-olympic years , according to a 2009 article in the @entity74			1
@entity27 : ' i 'm done with swimming ' fresh off his record - setting @entity72 performance , in an offseason where he was more concerned about tricking out his new apartment than training , he told @entity67 he was n't worried about the future even though he was out of shape and had put on some pounds			1
" when i have to turn the switch back on , i know i can			0
all i have to do is put my mind to something and that 's it , it 's done , " he said			0
it took a few years , but after some controversy he became motivated again			0
if @entity91 were a country : counting up the medals he was banned from competition for three months in 2009 after a tabloid newspaper ran a photo of him appearing to inhale from a marijuana pipe			1
he almost retired , but decided the @entity99 would be his sendoff from the sport he began as a wispy child in @entity24			2
@entity27 , who started swimming to emulate his sisters at age 7 , set individual world records 29 times , and still owns records in six events			2
in the two competitive races he has left he probably wo n't be besting those times , now that he 's almost a swimming old man ( and due to slower swimsuits )			0
he wraps up a career as the most decorated olympian ever , perhaps the greatest ever			0
some commentators will argue the cases of track and field 's @entity120 , who missed an @entity68 due to a @entity52 boycott , or distance runner @entity124 , who won 12 medals			1
some might argue for @entity126 , the @entity127 cross-country skier			0
and there 's gymnast @entity129 , whose 18 medals are now second all time			1
it 's a class for which it does n't take long to call roll			0
@entity27 signs off with gold as world records tumble in swimming finale			0

@entity91 swam one event in his first @entity68 , placed fifth
at age 15 , though , *people* saw his potential to be great swimmer
three olympics later he has the most medals of all time , most golds
he raised the popularity of the sport in @entity52 through record - setting performances
