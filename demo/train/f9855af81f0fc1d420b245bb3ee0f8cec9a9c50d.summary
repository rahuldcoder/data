-- whether he is predicting the demise of the @entity4 " empire , " questioning @entity4 accounts of the 9/11 attacks or accusing @entity7 of using the @entity8 as an excuse for supporting @entity10 , @entity1 knows how to push the @entity12 's buttons at the @entity13			1
for the third straight year , @entity4 diplomats on thursday joined envoys from several other nations in walking out during the @entity19 president 's address at the annual @entity21 gathering in @entity22			1
that does n't even count instances before that , when @entity4 diplomats conspicuously skipped his speech altogether			2
this year , @entity1 said @entity7 countries " still use the @entity8 after six decades as the excuse to pay ( a ) fine or ransom to the @entity32 , " and that the @entity4 killed @entity34 leader @entity33 instead of investigating " hidden elements involved in september 11			1
" @entity36 , @entity4 ambassador to the @entity21 , was n't impressed			1
" we find what @entity1 does and says when he comes to the @entity21 absolutely odious , hateful , anti-semitic , unacceptable , which is why the @entity4 for three consecutive years -- including today -- have led a walkout of his speech , " @entity37 told @entity0 's @entity38 on thursday			1
" inevitably he says something outrageous , dishonest and offensive , and that leads to a walkout			0
" here is a look back at @entity1 's other @entity21 speeches , and reactions to them : 2010 representatives from the @entity4 , @entity52 , @entity53 and other nations walked out while @entity1 asserted that the @entity4 government either participated in the 9/11 attacks or let them happen as an excuse to wage war in @entity59 and @entity60			1
he said most @entity4 and " most nations around the world " believe that " some segments within the @entity4 government orchestrated the attack , " adding that these people believe the attacks were aimed at reversing " the declining @entity4 economy and its scripts on the @entity69 in order to save the @entity72 regime			2
" he also said capitalism and the current world order had reached their demise after 100 years of domination , saying that they were " unable to provide appropriate solutions to the problems that society faces			0
" 2009 in september 2009 , @entity1 was critical of the wars in @entity59 and @entity60 , where he said " thousands of innocent people have been killed , injured or displaced , infrastructures have been destroyed and regional security has been seriously jeopardized			2
" he ripped capitalism , saying it brought about the conditions leading to the world 's economic crisis			0
he also called for a " return to monotheism and justice , " calling it " the greatest hope and opportunity in all ages and generations			0
" he blasted @entity10 , accusing it of " crimes ... against defenseless women and children and destruction of their homes , farms , hospitals and schools			2
" the next day , @entity10 prime minister @entity106 criticized the @entity19 leader at the @entity13			1
the delegations that stayed for @entity1 's address gave " legitimacy to a man who denies the murder of 6 million jews , " @entity106 said , referring to the @entity8			1
2008 @entity1 told the @entity13 in 2008 that the " @entity115 " was nearing its end , and that @entity10 " is on a definite slope to collapse			1
" while he stopped short of calling for @entity10 to be politically wiped off the map as he had previously , he called for " a free referendum in @entity119 for determining and establishing the type of state in the entire @entity123 lands			2
" the @entity129 , he said , " can not do anything , and sometimes under pressure from a few bullying powers , even paves the way for supporting these @entity72 murders			0
" he blamed a few world powers for the world 's problems , and defended his country 's nuclear activities as peaceful			0
the @entity4 and other @entity136 nations had long suspected that @entity19 had been pursuing nuclear weapons , but @entity19 said it seeks only a civilian nuclear energy program			1
he accused the @entity4 of oppressing @entity59 with six years of occupation , saying @entity4 were " still seeking to solidify their position in the political geography of the region and to dominate oil resources			0
" the only person at the @entity4 ' table was a note - taker ; no @entity4 diplomat was present			0
2007 in a 2007 speech that blasted " selfish and incompetent " governments that have " obedience to @entity152 , " @entity1 said the @entity129 " ranks first " among ineffective international bodies because it is influenced by " monopolistic powers			1
" @entity1 invited " all independent , justice - seeking and peace - loving nations " to join @entity19 in a " coalition for peace			1
" he also criticized unnamed " powers " that he said were responsible for insecurity , division and moral decline across the world			0
" is it not high time for these powers to return from the path of arrogance and obedience to @entity152 to the path of faith in @entity171 ? " he said			0
he criticized the @entity4 without naming it , offering blunt assessments of the @entity59 war and @entity175 's war on terrorism			2
" setting up secret prisons , abducting ( people ) , trials and secret punishments without any regard to due process , extensive tappings of telephone conversations , intercepting private mail and frequent summons to police and security centers have become commonplace and prevalent			0
" the @entity4 delegation 's chairs were unoccupied , except for one woman taking notes			2
earlier , he had asked to lay a wreath at the site of the destroyed @entity196 towers , but @entity22 officials denied the request , citing safety concerns at what was then a construction site			0
2006 @entity1 said in 2006 that the @entity4 ' permanent inclusion on the @entity129 undermines its effectiveness and credibility			1
he also criticized " unwarranted support " for @entity10 during conflicts in the @entity123 territories and @entity207			0
on @entity59 , @entity1 said the @entity4 , whom he called " the occupiers , " is " incapable of establishing security , " and scores were dying daily as a result			1
" where can the people of @entity59 seek refuge , and from whom can the people of @entity59 seek justice ? " he asked			0
how can the @entity129 act " when the occupiers themselves are permanent members of the council ? " 2005 @entity1 in 2005 told the @entity13 that @entity19 had a right to operate a nuclear energy program			1
he said it was unfair that some nations were allowed to make nuclear fuel while others are condemned for it			0
" today , the most serious challenges is that the culprits are assuming the role of prosecutor , " he said , accusing the @entity4 of " bullying the others while through huge media resources portraying themselves as defenders of freedom			0
