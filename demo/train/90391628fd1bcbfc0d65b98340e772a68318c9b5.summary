@entity0 -- a winter storm slammed the @entity3 all the way from @entity5 down to @entity0 , leaving massive drifts of snow and skull - cracking cold			2
citizens wrapped themselves in layers of fleece like the townsfolk from " dr. @entity14			2
" yet inside the @entity17 , an unusual spirit of warmth greeted president @entity18 's third @entity20 address			2
the still recent shooting of rep. @entity22 prompted dozens of members to cross the aisle and sit among political foes in a show of solidarity			2
some 43 million people tuned in on tv to hear the president lay out his assessments , hopes and dreams about how we could or would pull the nation out of its economic deep freeze			2
in a far - ranging speech , he did just that : talking up some of his signature items , such as clean energy , education , and health care			1
he also addressed growing concerns about the need for tax reform , deficit control , and of course foreign affairs			1
so how much of it heated up and moved forward , and how much remains on ice a year later ? health care / @entity54 regulations @entity56 have never liked the president 's health care reform plans			1
so he invited them to tell him how it should be changed , and just to get the ball rolling , he made a proposal of his own : " if you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable , " @entity18 said , " i am eager to work with you			1
we can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small business			1
" he was talking about a requirement that forced companies to expand their reporting to the @entity54			1
it was a measure that pretty much everyone thought was wasteful and annoying , so @entity81 and @entity56 climbed on board , passing a bill to remove the regulation			2
the president signed it in april , making that a proposal accepted and a @entity88			2
health care / malpractice the president made it clear that he will not go along with broad @entity56 designs to dismantle health care reform			1
" still , " he said , " i am willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs , including one that @entity56 suggested last year : medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits			1
" the @entity101 has analyzed the impact of this idea and estimated that it would reduce the cost of care to the government in programs like @entity108 and @entity109 , and in turn that would reduce deficits by about $ 50 billion over the next nine or 10 years			1
but the legislation to make this happen got tangled up in bigger debates , and went nowhere			2
this one is not entirely dead , but it is certainly stalled			1
oil company tax breaks rising gas prices , oil company profits , and the @entity121 spill in the @entity122 had many voters on the warpath , a circumstance not missed by @entity18			1
" i 'm asking @entity127 to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies			1
" but just because you ask does not mean you will receive , especially in @entity0 in may , the @entity132 considered a @entity134 - sponsored bill to cut oil company tax breaks by $ 2 billion annually			1
a few @entity81 joined the @entity56 opposition ; a couple of @entity56 helped the @entity81 , but in the end it failed by four votes			2
so , adjusted for inflation , oil companies continue to enjoy $ 4.4 billion in tax breaks annually			1
last year was the first ever that the average price of a gallon of gas never went below $ 3			2
our cars are still running , but like an old @entity149 , this idea stalled			1
earmarks the president drew a few lines in the sand , and this was one of them			0
" if a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside , i will veto it			0
" true to his word , he has not signed any bills since containing earmarks -- at least , none we can find			0
he did not veto any either , however , because they never came his way			0
the @entity169 declared an earmark moratorium ; not just because of the veto threat , but also because the @entity172 said it would not approve any bills with earmarks			0
in any case , the president has often straddled this fence : he has been a sharp critic of earmarks but he also hassigned bills containing multiple pet projects , including a spending bill in 2009 that had almost $ 8 billion worth			0
so we 'll have to say circumstances left this proposal a @entity88 , though only on a technicality			0
tuition tax credit the cost of higher education jumped last year for many families , up as much as 20 % in several states			1
many local governments are in such economic straits that they ca n't help much , so the president turned to the legislative branch			0
" i ask @entity127 to go further , and make permanent our tuition tax credit worth $ 10,000 for four years of college			1
" that did not come close to happening			0
legislation extending the tuition tax credit did not even make it to the floor in either house of @entity127			1
proponents say that could change , however , since that temporary tax credit will expire at the end of this year increasing the political pressure for some kind of action			1
but for the moment , the idea is stalled			1
@entity213 more than eight years after the @entity214 and coalition forces invaded @entity213 , with thousands of @entity214 lives lost and enormous sacrifice on the part of our military and their families , @entity18 told the @entity214 people that their troops were coming home			1
" this year , our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the @entity213 people , while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of @entity213			1
" by the end of the year , the president had kept his word			0
the last @entity214 troops crossed the @entity213 border in december , marking the end of military combat operations			1
@entity236 this one is trickier			0
" this year , we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an @entity236 lead , " the president said , " and this july , we will begin to bring our troops home			0
" some troops have started coming home , true ; so if you focus on only that narrow statement , you have to give the president credit			0
but there is a bigger picture that many critics insist must be considered			0
right before @entity18 took office , 32,500 @entity214 troops were in @entity236			0
however , he approved two troop surges which doubled our military presence there			0
so by the time we vote for president again this fall , just under 70,000 will still be fighting among the poppy fields			0
for that reason , we have to call this pledge a @entity262			0
transparency this @entity172 has promised from the start to be more open , more transparent about the way it does business , than any that we 've seen before			1
for the tweeting president , that meant cueing the tech talk about a special new program in the @entity273			0
" because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent , you 'll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history			2
" the administration lit up the @entity283 project in april , on tax day			1
it can be found at whitehouse.gov under the taxes section , and you can indeed get a breakdown on where your tax dollars go			2
reorganizing government one of the chief planks in the president 's campaign platform was a promise to change the way @entity0 does business , and in his last @entity20 , he got specific			0
" in the coming months , my administration will develop a proposal to merge , consolidate , and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive @entity214			0
" he did it , in the sense that after almost an entire year , he finally unveiled what he had in mind : combining six departments and agencies , all related to business , investments , or trade			0
it is a reorganization , but not nearly as broad as many of his critics expected , or arguably as robust as what he hinted was coming			0
this is a judgment call , but because of the timing and limited scope of what he finally came up , we will say this seems a @entity262 at best			0
bipartisanship the president promised from the very start that he was the man who could get everyone to work together			0
he echoed that theme several times in his @entity20 in 2011 , but with the 2012 address upon us , the two parties seem perhaps more deeply divided than ever before			0
you ca n't say that 's all his fault , but it is absolutely an idea that has stalled in a big way .			2

promises kept on @entity213 *withdrawal* , reducing reporting burden in health care law
improving transparency with the @entity283 project was another
promises stalled : @entity348 , malpractice reform , oil company tax breaks
