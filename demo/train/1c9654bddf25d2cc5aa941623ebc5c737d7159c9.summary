-- complaints of itchy , irritated wrists have prompted @entity3 to voluntarily recall all of its @entity5 wristband activity trackers			1
about 1.7 % of force users reported cases of skin rashes after wearing the devices , @entity3 ceo @entity6 said in a letter to customers on friday afternoon			1
the cause of the irritation , which is assumed to be allergic contact dermatitis , is either the nickel that 's in the stainless steel part of the device , or adhesives or other materials used in the strap			1
the $ 130 force wearable pedometer was released at the end of 2013 and is the most recent product from the fitness hardware company			2
@entity26 is a silicon wristband with a small display and sensors for measuring motion			0
it tracks the wearer 's number of steps , calories burned , distance traveled , and sleep patterns and syncs the information to a computer or smartphone			0
" on behalf of the entire @entity3 team , i want to apologize to anyone affected , " @entity6 said			1
" from the beginning , we have taken this matter very seriously			0

any force owners interested in returning their wristbands for a full refund can fill out a form on the @entity3 website or call the company 's customer service center			1
they 'll receive a kit to mail the @entity5 back to the company and should receive a refund check in two to six weeks			1

@entity3 still sells its other popular trackers , including the older @entity80 wristband and wearable trackers that clip onto clothes			2
