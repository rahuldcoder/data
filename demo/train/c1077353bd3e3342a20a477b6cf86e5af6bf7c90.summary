the first thing i noticed as we drove into the indigenous @entity4 village of @entity5 was a giant satellite dish			1
immediately i knew this village was very different from the traditional @entity9 villages i had read about before coming to @entity10			1
these villagers had houses built for them by the government in 1995 when the @entity14 was established			2
they had a generator , given to them by a timber company , to power lights and a television			2
we were a western television crew in giant trucks that had just driven in to film , and the villagers , who knew we were coming , did n't seem bothered by us at all			2
it 's hard to imagine all the changes these @entity29 village elders , seemingly in their forties and fifties , had seen in their lifetimes			1
in the last few decades , deforestation has taken around half of @entity10 's rainforest , changing the physical landscape and the social dynamic for these indigenous people			1

they would have hunted and gathered everything they needed from the surrounding rainforest and they would have had very little interaction with the outside world			2
we came here with the @entity52 who have set up an education program in more than 30 villages surrounding 30 @entity14			2
the educators work with each of the villages , teaching the people about conservation and their work releasing former - pet orangutans			1
their main goals are to help villagers appreciate the forest and keep the villagers from hunting or killing the orangutans			2
@entity52 educators come to this village twice a month to talk to the elders and hold classes for the kids			1
walking into the classroom , this seemed like any other western school			2
it was a two - room building with a tile floor and the kids were a range of ages from around 5 to 10 years old			0
they wore brightly colored clothing , some with western logos like @entity84			0
their desks were pushed up against the wall and the children were sitting in a circle learning from the two @entity52 educators			0
the children colored pictures , drew animals , sang songs and played games			0
interactive : mission to save @entity10 's rainforest what struck me the most about these children is that they were so well behaved and seemed to really enjoy the class			1
we joined them , filming and participating in the activities			0
the kids did n't seem to mind at all			0
going back through the footage , none of the children acted out to the cameras			0
most of them did n't even look at our cameramen @entity113 and @entity114 as they were filming			0
in a classroom in the @entity117 , that would n't have been the case			0
a few of the adult villagers leaned against the walls outside waiting for the class to finish			0
i had read about @entity4 people shunning the outside world , refusing to educate their children and insisting on living the way their ancestors had lived			1
this village seemed to have embraced their western neighbors and many of their habits			1
they still kept to some of the old traditions , though			0
they survived on hunting wild pig , as we found out when one of the villagers came by with his spear during our interview with the village chief			1
it was also then that we learned that they were animists , a religion believing that animals , plants and places have a spiritual significance			0
read more : profitable palm oil leaves environment poor the villagers were so well adapted to the outside world , i had expected them to have converted to @entity156 , the main religion in @entity157			1
villagers here gather non-timber forest products like a medicinal plant they called " dragonsblood " which they sell to by petrol for their generators			0
but as more and more of the surrounding rainforest is cut down , the elders of the village worry what will happen to their way of life if the forest is completely cut down			1
these villagers have all adapted so much to the outside world already			0
would their traditions , passed down from generations of @entity4 people , disappear ? would a way of life that had endured centuries die out because of the encroaching timber , palm and paper industries ?			1
