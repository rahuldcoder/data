@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the stroke of midnight sunday , @entity1 made history			1
it marked the first time a democratically - elected government served a full five - year term in the country 's 65 - year history			2
in its short existence , @entity1 has experienced three military coups , been ruled by generals for half its life , and it remains mired in near - constant political turmoil			1
" despite all the odds , completion of the term is an extraordinary and historic achievement , " prime minister @entity16 said in an address to the nation saturday night			2
@entity16 said his country has a long history of confrontation between democratic and nondemocratic forces , but that democracy has now notched a victory			0
in the next few days , a caretaker government will be put in place to oversee the country through its next elections scheduled for may			1
success at a price while the five - year term completion is a milestone well worth nothing , it has come with a price			1
the ruling @entity40 rode to power on the back of a populace disillusioned with then - president @entity45 's policies that led to shortage of essential food items , power cuts and a skyrocketing inflation			1
@entity1 also disapproved of the way @entity45 carried out his end of the " war on terror " -- and used it as a crutch to explain away many of his unpopular moves			1
and the nation was collectively mourning the death of @entity40 leader @entity57 , who was assassinated just months before the last elections in february 2008			2
very few held out hope the @entity40 would resolve the many problems that plagued @entity1			1
and throughout its five - year term , it seemed it could n't			0
minister after minister were tainted with accusations of corruption			0
the power outages and food shortages that @entity1 complained about remain			1
terror attacks in city centers continued with depressing regularity			0
violence directed at the @entity72 minority reached new heights			0
and @entity1 called the government stooges of the @entity75 , while @entity76 grumbled that @entity1 was not doing enough to confront militants			1
through it all , the shaky coalition the @entity40 cobbled together seemed on the verge of collapse every few months as partners threatened to walk away at the slightest disagreement			0
" we could not provide rivers of milk and honey but tried our best to alleviate the country 's problems , " @entity16 said in his saturday speech			0
staying the course but credit goes to two factors that helped the government stay the course : the military was content to sit on the sidelines through the topsy - turvy turns -- even when it seemed that the widening rift with the government would force it to intervene as it has in the past			2
and president @entity102 -- @entity57 's widower -- proved surprisingly agile at survival			0
three years ago , he handed over much of his power to the prime minister -- and in the process , robbed his critics of the accusation that he was amassing power like his predecessor			0
he also transferred some power from the central government to the provincial level			2
@entity45 's return against this backdrop comes news that @entity45 plans to return to @entity1 from self - imposed exile in the @entity119 , and lead his party in upcoming elections			1
@entity45 plans to fly on a commercial airline into @entity123 on march 24 , then attend a rally with 50,000 people , including more than 200 @entity1 expatriates from the @entity75 , @entity127 , the @entity128 and the @entity119 , he said in a statement			1
five years is often enough time for a populace to forgive and forget			0
it remains to be seen whether @entity1 , now soured by @entity40 's reign , welcomes him back with open arms			2
@entity2 's @entity136 reported from @entity0 ; @entity137 wrote from @entity138			0
@entity2 's @entity139 also contributed .			0

@entity1 has had three military coups
next , a caretaker government will oversee elections
the milestone has come with a price
@entity45 has said he will return this month
