@entity3 says it discovered the apparent sabotage of a noncritical component of the international space station			1
@entity3 said it will try to launch @entity9 on august 7 for the spacecraft 's first mission in nearly five years			1
@entity9 , fresh from a complete overhaul and the last of @entity3 's three remaining shuttles to return to flight following the 2003 @entity26 disaster , is due to carry out a construction mission to the $ 100 - billion space station			1
it will be @entity3 's second shuttle flight of the year			2
@entity9 was almost totally rebuilt during its overhaul and was like a new space shuttle , shuttle program manager @entity30 told reporters at @entity34 in @entity1 , where the launch will take place			2
" it 's like driving a new car off the showroom floor , " @entity30 said			0
@entity9 's seven crew members include teacher - astronaut @entity41 , who trained 22 years ago as the backup to teacher - in - space @entity43 , one of the astronauts who died when @entity45 blew up at liftoff in january 1986			0
@entity9 will be carrying a new support beam for the half - finished space station and a replacement gyroscope needed to help the outpost maintain its position in space			1
among the shuttle 's upgrades is a new system that will enable the spacecraft to tap into the station 's electrical system and stay longer at the outpost			0
if the power transfer system works properly , @entity3 plans to extend @entity9 's mission from 11 to 14 days			2
that will allow time for the crew to finish extra work preparing the orbital outpost for the arrival later this year and next year of laboratories built by @entity68 and @entity69			0
it also will carry a module loaded with about 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies for the station crew			0
