-- @entity1 wrapped up his second @entity3 victory -- and sixth grand tour success -- after the 21st and final stage time - trial in @entity6 , won by @entity8 @entity7			1
@entity7 completed the 26km stage in 30 minutes and 13 seconds , with @entity1 taking third place , 36 seconds behind			0
that meant the 28 - year - old @entity12 finished a comfortable six minutes and 10 seconds clear of @entity14 @entity13 in the overall classification with another @entity14 , @entity17 champion @entity16 , back in third place a further 46 seconds behind			1
@entity20 rider @entity19 dies in @entity3 crash @entity22 rider @entity1 , who also has three @entity24 titles and one @entity17 success to his name , proved the dominant rider in the race after taking the leader 's pink jersey on the ninth stage to @entity32			1
he will now seek to become the first rider since @entity34 in 1998 to win the @entity3 and @entity24 in the same year			1
@entity1 won the @entity17 in 2007 , 2009 and last year and was only prevented from racing in 2008 because his then team , @entity35 , were denied a start place by organizers due to doping infringements			0
however , a question mark still hangs over last year 's @entity17 victory after @entity1 tested positive for a tiny amount of the banned muscle - building substance clenbuterol during last july 's race			2
the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) acquitted @entity1 of any wrong - doing , rescinding an initial decision to give him a one - year ban after accepting the rider 's claim that he had unknowingly eaten drug - contaminated meat and was therefore not negligent			2
but the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) and cycling 's governing body ( @entity53 ) have appealed against the @entity45 decision to the @entity56 ( @entity56 )			0
the case concerning @entity1 was due to be heard by @entity56 from june 6 - 8 in order to have the decision before the start of this year 's @entity24 on july 2 -- but @entity56 announced last week they had postponed the hearing to allow further preparation by all parties .			0
