@entity0 -- in the emotional aftermath of the @entity4 killing last year , attorney general @entity2 signaled the unlikelihood of filing federal hate crimes charges against admitted shooter @entity7			1
" for a federal hate crime , we have to prove the highest standard in the law , " @entity2 said in april 2012 , 45 days after @entity7 shot the @entity10 teenager in what was depicted by civil rights groups as a racially motivated killing			1
in words that now sound prescient , @entity2 described to reporters that day how " something that was reckless , that was negligent does not meet that standard			0
" " we have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind , " he said			0
@entity7 's acquittal of state murder and manslaughter charges on saturday showed the @entity29 jury rejected that he intended to kill @entity4 for any reason , including the racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated @entity4 's civil rights			1
the @entity35 opened an investigation into the @entity7 case last year , and a statement from the agency on sunday said it was ongoing and will now include evidence and testimony from the @entity29 trial			1
in a speech in @entity0 on monday , @entity2 said the @entity35 would " continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law " in examining what he called " the tragic , unnecessary shooting death of @entity4			1
" " independent of the legal determination that will be made , i believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised , " @entity2 said			2
" we must not - as we have too often in the past - let this opportunity pass			0
" separately , the @entity58 said president @entity59 would play no role in deciding whether federal charges are filed			1
" cases are brought on the merits and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the @entity35 , " @entity58 spokesman @entity62 told reporters			0
the president on sunday called @entity4 's killing a tragedy for @entity70 , but said in a written statement that the jury had spoken			1
he acknowledged the case had " elicited strong passions , " but urged " calm reflection			0
" still , political pressure for a federal case is mounting			2
demonstrators around the country are calling for @entity7 to be punished , and hundreds of thousands of people have signed online petitions by the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) that call for federal charges			1
however , legal experts make the same point holder did last year in saying the law limits the federal government 's options			1
watch @entity2 's speech because @entity7 is a private citizen , he can only be charged with a hate crime in terms of civil rights violations under federal law , said @entity94 , a former federal prosecutor in @entity29 who now is in private practice			1
to successfully prosecute @entity7 , the @entity35 would have to show that @entity7 " caused the death of @entity4 solely motivated by / because of his race or color , " @entity94 told @entity1 in an e-mail , adding : " this element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly does n't exist			1
" five reasons for acquittal @entity1 legal analyst @entity104 agreed monday that federal prosecutors are " in sort of a tough spot			2
" the hate crimes statue is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents , @entity104 said , adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is " very , very rare and i think in this case , it 's going to be very hard to prove			1
" a federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison			1
even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges , it would not be double jeopardy for @entity7 because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity			1
those seeking federal charges say the killing was racially motivated , arguing that @entity7 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , targeted @entity4 for special scrutiny because the teenager was an @entity10			1
regardless of how the shooting occurred , they say , the fight occurred because of @entity4 's race			0
" the most fundamental of civil rights â € ” the right to life â € ” was violated the night @entity7 stalked and then took the life of @entity4 , " says the petition on the @entity82 website			2
petition to @entity58 rep. @entity143 , the @entity145 @entity144 who chairs the @entity146 , said racial profiling like what @entity7 did to @entity4 " continues to make communities of innocent individuals fear a justice system designed to protect them			2
" " men and women wonder if merely walking or driving justifies being followed , stopped , or questioned , " @entity153 said in a statement monday			0
" this practice and the presumption of guilt so often associated with people of color must come to an end			0
" a crush of petitioners crashed the @entity82 website during the night , causing the group to set up a parallel petition drive on the liberal @entity169 website , said @entity170 of the @entity82			0
a separate petition effort on the @entity58 website generated nearly 15,000 supporters			0
such political pressure evokes memories of the @entity177 case in 1991 , when videotape of white @entity180 police officers clubbing an @entity10 man after a car chase prompted race - tinged national furor			0
when a criminal court failed to convict the officers of police brutality , riots ensued in @entity180 over alleged racial discrimination			2
the @entity35 then filed a civil rights suit against the officers , alleging " deprivations of federal rights under color of law , " and two were convicted in 1993			2
a court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison			0
@entity94 said the @entity35 ca n't file similar charges against @entity7 because he is a private citizen instead of a police officer or government official of any kind			2
" there are no other relevant sections under which to prosecute him " other than the hate crime statute , which covers " offenses involving actual or perceived race , color , religion , or national origin , " @entity94 added			0
however , @entity4 's family can still file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against @entity7 to seek penalties and damages			0
such a legal move carries no criminal penalty or prison time			0
@entity59 wo n't get involved in decision @entity1 's @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 and @entity224 editor @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
