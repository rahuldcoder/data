-- i am 17 years old and a senior in high school			2
i am also , like thousands of other people living on this planet , sick			2
like " spend a quarter of my life in the hospital , do treatments every day to stay alive " sick			1
i was born with cystic fibrosis , which the @entity10 describes as a " life - threatening genetic disease that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system			1
" i was only 13 years old when i was forced to face the fragility of my own life			1
a routine surgery landed me in a medically induced coma for two weeks with a mere 1 % chance of surviving			2
today , i do breathing treatments for up to four hours a day and take around 30 pills			0
up until a few years ago , my life expectancy was 25			1
every breath i take is a miracle			0
i want you all to know that this is n't a sob story			0
i 'm not here to make you feel bad for the poor sick kid			0
in fact , i hope to accomplish quite the opposite			0
i want to share a story about finding joy and beauty in places that others see pain and suffering			1
i am sick , yes			0
but i am so much more			0
my life is wonderful , not in spite of this illness but because of it			1
i 'm writing to you from the hospital , a.k.a. my second home			1
when i was younger and obsessed with becoming an artist , the hospital was my @entity47 loft apartment			1
i would move the furniture around to create space on the floor , throw down some sheets and indulge in any form of art that i could get my hands on			0
the people who would come and visit loved to tell me how sorry they were that i had to live this kind of life : sick and alone , trapped in hospital room after hospital room			1
i would argue with them , tirelessly			0
i 'd try to show them that although this life may be different from their own , it was anything but miserable			1
oftentimes , it was wasted effort			0
i still wonder why they could never see my time in the hospital the way i did : as a blank canvas waiting to be turned into something beautiful			1
as i got older , my life become a whirlwind of homework and responsibilities			1
the hospital became my retreat , a place to gather my thoughts and focus on my health			2
the nurses are my friends as well as my caretakers			0
the doctors are my parents as well as my physicians			0
hospital life , like all of life , is filled with both pain and joy in equal measures			1
there are so many moments to share , so much life that has been lived in these hospital rooms -- from late - night room service orders with my friends to @entity98 movie marathons to wake - me - up - at - 2 - in - the - morning blood draws that taught me patience			1
there were moments of total contentment , when i would look up from my homework and see the sun setting over the hospital courtyard , washing my room in an orange glow			2
like all teenagers , i had the lonely nights , the sleepless nights and the stay - up - late - finishing - homework nights			0
i even threw three new years eve parties as a patient , complete with sparkling juice and beeping ivs			0
sure , there were endless tests and procedures ; doctors always finding something else that was wrong with my body			0
but there was also laughter , those moments when we could see how wrong the world had been : a short life can be as rich as a long one			2
something that always surprises people to hear is that my health has very little to do with my happiness			0
yeah , being sick can suck ( big time ) , but nothing is one - sided			2
i ca n't let the pain block out the beauty			2
when i was 13 , my parents and i started a foundation to support families like ours living with cystic fibrosis , called the @entity144			1
when i was 14 , i became a public speaker , and now i am creating a video series called " the @entity147			1
" get it ? @entity149 - ity			0
the videos shine a light on hospital life and break down the social barriers we have around people who are sick			1
the past four years have been a whirlwind of traveling , speaking , fundraising and experiencing life in ways i never imagined			2
some things in life are ours to choose , while other things choose us			2
i never chose to live this crazy bizarre life with cystic fibrosis , and i did n't wake up from the coma with a plan to move my life down a totally different path			1
yet that seems to be exactly what happened			0
and , of course , i would n't want it any other way .			0
