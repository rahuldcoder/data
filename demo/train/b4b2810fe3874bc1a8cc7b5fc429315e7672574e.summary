-- as divers searched frigid waters off @entity4 in low visibility , hoping to save hundreds of passengers , a dominant theory began to emerge about how the ferry sank			1
it most likely struck something in the water , said @entity11 , a retired @entity12 captain			2
" the speed with which this ferry began to list and then roll over on its side suggests significant damage , most likely causing major flooding that would cause a vessel of this size -- almost 500 feet long -- to quickly roll onto its side			2
that 's very likely the result of significant damage , " he said			2
some passengers reported hearing a loud bang before the ship began sinking			1
that could be from cargo shifting or " some other internal damage , " @entity11 told @entity0 's " @entity30			2
" " but it does sound , from initial reports , it was more likely that something was struck			2
" when the ship left @entity36 , it traveled through fog , which may have put it off course , said @entity39 , former inspector general for the @entity40			1
" so if they hit something , that would have meant they were out of the channel , which is quite easy to do , " @entity39 said			2
' we are not dead yet ' passengers texted but the @entity48 said thursday that the ferry did not deviate significantly from its intended route			1
the agency approved the ferry 's intended route , and " there was no huge difference between their plan and the actual track chart , " spokesman @entity51 said			1
@entity39 said other possibilities include engine failure or an explosion , particularly in the engine room			0
" but that probably alone would n't account for the sinking this quickly			0
it probably was something else that happened , " she said			0
making matters worse , the ferry carried dozens of vehicles			0
once an auto deck is breached , " it 's typically open to very significant flooding , " @entity11 said			0
that could explain " why the ferry in just a matter of hours began to roll onto its side so quickly			0
" coast guard and navy ships , as well as fishing boats , rushed into the area			0
the challenge ahead for rescue divers , a combination of factors makes saving people especially difficult : very cold waters , strong currents and low visibility , made worse by nightfall			0
" the underwater challenges are very , very significant and pose , i would think , tremendous risk for the people who i 'm sure are doing their best to help , " @entity11 said			0
for the passengers , the most immediate danger is the cold			1
" pretty much everyone we saw was wearing a life jacket , " journalist @entity98 reported on @entity99			1
" so the concern is hypothermia			1
if you 're not picked up within two hours , you 're in significant danger -- your body core goes cold			1
" can they survive in air pockets ? some of the rescued passengers report that when the ship began to sink , they were told to jump into the water immediately -- and not to take time to get into life boats			1
sometimes after a breach , as the water begins gushing in , " there 's a sucking , there 's a motion , that just makes it impossible to fight , " @entity39 said			0
" so the order to abandon ship might have indicated that			1
... it 's almost like a suction that occurs when the water starts coming on , and you ca n't fight it			0
" but other passengers said they were told to stay on the ship			1
sometimes , " conflicting commands " are given , @entity39 said			0
" there can be a lot of confusion in an event like this			0
