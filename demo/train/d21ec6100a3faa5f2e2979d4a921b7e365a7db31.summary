-- @entity1 is just the latest in a long line of encyclopedias			1
in fact , encyclopedias have been around in some form or another for 2,000 years			0
the oldest , @entity6 , written by @entity7 , is still in existence			0
how do i know this ? i looked it up on @entity1 , of course			1
is it true ? possibly			0
ten years after its founding , it 's hard to imagine what life was like before @entity1			1
when i was growing up , our family had a dusty set of encyclopedias that were at least 10 years old , which is fine if you 're looking up dinosaurs , but not so good if you want to know , for instance , who the current president of the @entity26 is			0
but though the limitations of the old encyclopedias were obvious , they were authoritative in ways that @entity1 is not			1
@entity0 : 9 ways to get more out of @entity33 like most people , i 'll take the tradeoff			0
i have no desire to go back to the days of printed @entity37			0
if someone would have told me back in 2001 that , within a few years , there would be a comprehensive , free online encyclopedia , i would n't have believed them			0
why would someone do that ? how ? origins by now , we all know the story : two @entity48 devotees , @entity49 and @entity50 , created @entity1 in january 2001			1
the founding can be traced to a post by @entity50 entitled " @entity53 " that was intended as a feature to @entity50 and @entity57 's other project , @entity58			1
@entity59 , @entity50 explained in the post , was derived from " wikiwiki , " a @entity62 word for " quick			1
" " what it means is a very open , very publicly editable series of web pages , " @entity50 wrote in the post			1
as often happens , the feature grew out of proportion with its original intent			0
@entity57 , who was originally against the idea of a @entity59 , became a strong proponent of it , while @entity50 , who became estranged from the project in 2002 , now charges that @entity57 hogged the credit for the venture			1
@entity0 : the future of the social media strategist ( @entity57 could not be reached for comment			0
to his credit , @entity50 is mentioned as a co-founder on @entity1 's entry about its founding			1
) rooted in open source thinking , @entity1 contributors began penning a voluminous number of entries ( the site claims there are now 17 million such articles ) , which began showing up in @entity91 searches , furthering the site 's growth and notoriety			1
meanwhile , a subculture developed around @entity1 , with self - appointed guardians doing their best to make sure entries were accurate and free of vandalism			2
as an authoritative 2006 @entity108 article on @entity1 noted , " a study by @entity100 suggests that although vandalism does occur ( particularly on high - profile entries like ' @entity105 ' ) , watchful members of the huge @entity1 community usually swoop down to stop the malfeasance shortly after it begins			2
" ' truth ' on the internet all of this made @entity1 a pretty good reference , but one that you 'd be wise not to take completely at face value			1
@entity1 works best as an introduction to a subject			2
since the articles usually cite references , readers can investigate further whether the claims are actually true			0
despite this , @entity1 soon earned a reputation for loopy reportage , an aspect best expressed in the @entity126 headline " @entity1 celebrates 750 years of @entity127			2
" such criticism , though , has it backwards			0
@entity1 is , in the best - case scenario , an antidote for the echo chamber of the web			1
after all , good luck finding " truth " on the @entity134			0
facts may be facts , but they 're subject to so much spin that it can be hard to get a handle on what 's objectively real			0
all the more reason why the idea of @entity1 is laudable , albeit a bit impractical			2
though @entity49 could have made a fortune selling ads on the site , he decided to make the @entity150 a non-profit charitable organization			1
@entity0 : 6 web pioneers on what the future looks like but someone has to keep all those servers running and pay those 50 full - time staffers , which is why @entity57 appeared in a ubiquitous banner ad on @entity1 asking for donations			1
the site eventually collected $ 16 million			0
the future can @entity1 sustain itself for another 10 years ? as @entity164 recently pointed out , the number of @entity1 's @entity163 language contributors fell from 54,000 in march 2007 to 35,000 in september 2010 , but here @entity1 may be the victim of its own success			2
as the site gets more comprehensive , there are fewer entries that need to be written			0
one thing 's for sure -- if @entity1 ever does go away , it will be hard to believe it			2
after all , where will we go to confirm such a thing ? Â© 2010 @entity0			0
