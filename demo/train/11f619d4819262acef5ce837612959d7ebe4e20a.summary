that 's why we do many different things , " she told @entity0			0

it was @entity22 who designed " that dress " that launched @entity71 's career and @entity2 's own safety pin moment came when @entity47 had the paparazzi and fashionistas goggling when she wore a plunging green @entity32 at the @entity75 in 2000			1

but in the meantime i had to be strong because everybody around me was looking at me for direction			0
but then i found my way and i started to believe in myself more and more , find my confidence and here i am , " she told @entity0			0
