-- behind nearly every @entity2 tragedy is a conspiracy theory			2
think @entity5 's assassination , even the 9/11 attacks			0
so it 's no surprise that there have been similar doubts that a fuel tank explosion caused the 1996 crash of @entity13 , killing all 230 people aboard			1
that was the government 's ruling , yet it never quelled the theory that a missile strike brought down the plane off the coast of @entity21 , @entity22			2
so why is an upcoming documentary set to air on an obscure cable channel that rehashes this theory getting so much attention this week ? " @entity13 " is based on the claims of former federal investigators who took part in the initial probe and witnesses who say their accounts were not taken seriously			1
they want a do - over			0
@entity35 , who was the @entity36 's senior accident investigator for @entity13 , is among the ex-investigators featured in the documentary calling for a new probe into what caused the crash			1
he said the @entity36 's final report on the crash ignored witnesses , misinterpreted bomb residue and misanalyzed radar data			1
bottom line , according to the documentary producers : " one or more ordnance explosions outside the aircraft caused the crash			1
" the documentary does not identify or speculate about who fired the ordnance ; it says only that they most likely were launched from the waters off @entity21			2
they are hoping that the @entity36 , the nation 's top investigative agency for plane crashes , will determine that by reopening the investigation into @entity13			1
all this is fueling suspicion that has been around for years about a possible cover - up			0
one story that surfaced shortly after the crash laid out an elaborate conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by a @entity68 " friendly fire " incident that was followed by a huge government cover - up			1
the report was co-authored by @entity72 , @entity73 and the late former @entity75 reporter @entity74			0
@entity72 later apologized for the report , saying " my effort to pin the crash ... on the @entity68 was reckless and a mistake			2
" related : still ' paranoid ' after all these years conspiracy talk gets people 's attention			1
as @entity0 commenter @entity83 points out : " conspiracies are very comforting creatures			0
" they give society " bad guys to hunt			0
" and any proof that contradicts the conspiracy " becomes more ' proof ' that there 's a conspiracy			2
" and colleagues of the ex-investigators featured in the documentary fear this is nothing more than an effort to stir up conspiracy theories			1
" i would never be part of any cover - up			0
period , " former @entity36 official @entity101 told @entity0			1
@entity101 , who served on the five - member @entity36 during the investigation , said he " took offense " at any suggestion that his team ignored evidence			1
none of the evidence detailing how the plane fell apart supports the missile theory , he said			2
it 's not like the missile theory was dismissed at the outset , said the top @entity116 investigator on the case , @entity118			1
" we took the ... possibility a missile brought down the plane very , very seriously , " @entity118 told @entity0			2
" we we 're 99 % sure that this was not a terrorist			0
" but what about that remaining 1 % ? there are parts of the investigation that can point " any way you want , " @entity101 said			2
but most importantly , he said , the pieces of the puzzle have to be judged " as a whole			0
" how about the former investigators in the documentary who are calling for a new probe ? do they stand to gain anything from all this ? " there 's no motive in this other than we want to get it straight , " said @entity35 , who wrote a petition asking the @entity36 to reopen its investigation			1
" it 's a matter of personal integrity for us ... we have nothing to gain financially or otherwise ... " read the petition @entity118 said he does n't question @entity35 ' motives , but he added , " i just wished if someone felt that strongly about speaking like that , they could have brought it to someone 's attention ... commencing with the investigation -- not wait 17 years until they get their pensions in their pockets and then come out with it			2
" longtime aviation journalist @entity162 thought one point was worth noting : the documentary boasts that " investigators finally break their silence			0
" that 's interesting because , @entity170 says , one of the investigators actually testified during a @entity172 hearing in 1999			0
" it would seem that if he had something more pertinent to say he would have said it long ago , " @entity170 wrote in her @entity0 opinion piece			0
much of the documentary -- which was made available to the media before its july 17 premiere -- rests its theory on an analysis of the evidence by the film 's co-producer , @entity184 , who was not involved in the probe			1
a longtime and passionate critic of the official investigation , @entity184 has been vexed by witness accounts that are at odds with the fuel tank explosion theory			0
of course if the disaster happened today , the world would weigh in almost immediately on what witnesses saw based on countless smartphone videos of the blast that would pop up online			0
so , will the @entity36 have to go back to square one all these years later ? @entity118 -- a former @entity116 assistant director -- said he would n't be opposed to the @entity116 joining with the @entity36 to take another look at the case			1
the agency told @entity0 it has received @entity35 ' petition and " will respond to the petitioners once a determination is made			0
" the @entity36 noted that petitions must be based on new evidence or " on a showing that the @entity36 's findings are erroneous			1
" new evidence ? the basic claim that a missile hit the plane is n't new , wrote @entity170			0
the radar data does n't appear to be new either , according to journalist @entity213 , one of @entity0 's lead producers covering the disaster			0
" as far as i can tell from reading the petition , there 's no new evidence , " @entity213 said			0
" but their alternative interpretation of existing evidence and their assumptions alone probably will not be sufficient to persuade the @entity36 to start all over again from scratch			1
" whatever comes out of all this , it 's unlikely to smother the debate and the conspiracy theories swirling around one of aviation history 's most mysterious plane crashes .			1

debate rages over documentary about 1996 crash of @entity13
*allegations* that @entity36 / @entity116 crash probe was *flawed* fuels conspiracy theories
ex-fbi investigation chief and @entity244 officials defend conclusions that crash was an accident
documentary suggests that missiles may have shot down the plane , killing all 230 people aboard
