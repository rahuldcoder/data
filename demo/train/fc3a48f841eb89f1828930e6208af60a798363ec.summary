@entity0 -- president @entity3 's plan to train and arm @entity5 rebels in their battle against @entity8 fighters faces deep skepticism from a large number of @entity12 senators who will vote thursday whether to approve the escalation of @entity16 involvement in the deadly conflict			1
while @entity23 leaders are confident the measure will pass , misgivings raised by so many senators from the president 's party speak to the difficulty the administration is having gaining traction for its @entity8 policy			1
it also suggests an upcoming debate in november over whether to ok broader military action against @entity8 could be contentious			0
@entity33 approves plan to assist @entity5 rebels @entity12 have a 55 - 45 majority in the @entity23 ( 53 @entity12 and two independents who caucus with the party )			1
in a floor speech wednesday , sen. @entity38 , a centrist @entity39 from @entity40 , cited reports that some of the moderate @entity5 rebels the @entity16 wants to arm had sold the @entity16 journalist @entity45 to @entity8 , which murdered him			1
" are those people our allies ? " he asked			0
" i strongly believe that if our military arms and trains @entity5 rebels , we will be involving ourselves in a ground conflict we can not resolve , where potentially everyone involved is our enemy , " @entity38 said			1
" there are a lot of people struggling with this vote right now , " said sen. @entity54 of @entity55			0
" i really have no idea what the ultimate vote will be			0
" @entity54 , a freshman @entity39 , is a leading critic of arming the rebels			1
he fears the weapons one day will be turned on @entity16			0
" i think it 's very hard to sort out the moderate rebels from the extremists and i have a real worry that once we send these rebels back into the battle space there is very little we can do to prevent them from locking arms with @entity74 or elements of @entity8 , " @entity54 explained			2
sen. @entity76 , an endangered @entity12 running in a tight re-election in @entity79 , said he is unhappy the serious question about the @entity5 rebels will be tucked inside a large government funding bill -- known as a continuing resolution , or @entity83 -- and is not likely to face a up or down vote by itself			1
" they should n't wedge this issue into the @entity83			0
this is an important issue to determine our role in the @entity90			0
for them to just throw it into the budget bill is a disservice to the @entity16 people , " @entity76 said as he left a vote on the @entity23 floor wednesday			1
@entity76 , like @entity54 , said he supports other aspects of the president 's policy to defeat @entity8 -- including airstrikes -- but is concerned the weapons the @entity16 provides the @entity5 will " end up in someone else 's hands that are not our friends			1
" other democrats in tough re-election campaigns have struggled to make up their minds			2
" i support the intent but i want to see the ( legislative ) language , " sen. @entity110 of @entity111 said			0
asked which way he would vote , sen. @entity114 of @entity115 told @entity1 he was undecided and " looking at the language right now " as he hustled to the @entity23 floor for a vote			2
minutes later as he left the @entity118 , he told @entity1 he intends " to vote for the president 's plan to arm the rebels			2
" even @entity122 , the second - ranking @entity23 @entity39 , could n't say whether he would vote yes			1
" there are some aspects of it i think need clarity , " he said as he rode a subway car to a @entity23 office building to listen to secretary of state @entity126 testify on @entity8 before the @entity127			2
" i want to wait and see			0
i think it 's only fair to the people i represent and the president			0
" sen. @entity135 , @entity136 , a member of the @entity137 , pushed back on critics of the president 's plan			0
she said the @entity16 intelligence community will play an important role in vetting the rebels and that training could take up to a year before arms are provided			2
" all of those people criticizing this choice , i have yet to hear their better idea , " she said			0
despite the lukewarm reception the president 's plan has gotten from many @entity12 , sen. @entity148 of @entity149 , the third - ranking @entity23 @entity39 , predicted it will pass			1
" i think on the @entity8 bill , while everyone is worried and has concerns , the president 's proposal has broad support and i think you 'll probably find a majority of @entity161 and majority of @entity12 voting for it , which in this place at this time is a rare thing , " he said .			1
