@entity0 , @entity1 -- railroad workers in @entity1 began trying to pull wrecked tank cars out of the @entity5 thursday as safety officials began trying to figure out why a train full of crude oil jumped the tracks and caught fire in the heart of @entity0			1
thirteen of the 105 cars derailed wednesday afternoon , and three of those ended up in the @entity5 where it winds past downtown @entity0 , @entity13 investigator @entity12 told reporters			1
the train was made up entirely of tank cars full of crude , and about 50,000 gallons of it were unaccounted for after the crash , authorities said wednesday night			1
there were no injuries in the derailment , but the resulting fire sent a pillar of black smoke rising over the city of about 78,000 people and forced the evacuation of much of its downtown for several hours			0
most of the oil that spilled from the train cars appears to have either burned off or has been contained , said @entity38 of the @entity39 of @entity40			2
there is an oil sheen on the river that stretches for about nine miles , and department personnel are testing water samples , he said			1
" we do expect that much of the oil that remains will be broken up by the fast - moving water of the @entity5 , " @entity38 said			1
@entity12 said investigators were just getting to work and began interviewing the crew thursday afternoon			0
in addition , the condition of the track and its bed after heavy rains will be one of the things they will examine , said @entity13 spokesman @entity59			2
@entity0 municipal spokeswoman @entity60 said worker were expecting to finish hauling the cars out of the river thursday night			2
parts of the railbed underneath the tracks had collapsed in the derailment and the remaining track was twisted , but @entity12 cautioned that investigators may not release any conclusions for more than a year			0
" this will be a well - orchestrated industrial ballet , " he said			1
the amount of oil shipped by rail has increased fourfold since 2005 amid a drilling boom in @entity77 and @entity78			0
those shipments have been under scrutiny since the derailment and fire that killed 47 people in a small town in @entity85 last july , and environmentalists warned against having trains haul oil through downtown @entity0 in march			0
some of the cars on the train were of a model that the @entity13 has said has a high incidence of leaking during crashes			1
but @entity12 said investigators do n't know whether any of the cars that derailed wednesday were among them			2
the @entity95 estimates that more than 90,000 of those cars are used to carry hazardous materials			0
about 14,000 of them have been built to the latest safety standards , the association says			0
