@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prime minister @entity3 dissolved the nation 's parliament monday and called for new elections			1
but the move did little to appease anti-government protesters who remained on the streets by the thousands			2
between 100,000 and 150,000 demonstrators rallied in @entity0 , with protest leaders saying their goal monday is to storm @entity3 's office , known as @entity15			1
the country will hold new elections by february 2 , but embattled prime minister @entity3 may not be her party 's choice to run , a government spokesman told @entity2 on monday			1
" i do n't know whether the @entity23 will still vote ( for ) her to run again or not , " said spokesman @entity21 , referring to the ruling party			1
@entity3 's move monday comes a day after @entity1 's main opposition party , @entity26 , said its roughly 150 members would resign en masse from parliament because they could no longer work with the government			1
" i do n't want our country and the @entity1 people to suffer from more losses , " @entity3 said in a televised address			2
but opposition party leader @entity35 said the massive protests leave the government little choice			0

protesters and police , who had confronted each other with tear gas and rocks in parts of @entity0 last week , agreed to a truce tuesday in a show of respect for @entity1 's revered king , who celebrated his 86th birthday thursday			1
protest leaders have said they want to rid @entity1 of the influence of former prime minister @entity54 , the older brother of @entity3			2

@entity54 was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas			0
