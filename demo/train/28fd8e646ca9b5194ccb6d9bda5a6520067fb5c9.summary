-- a fair number of impressive construction plans have been announced this year , from @entity4 's intention to create the world 's first shipping tunnel to @entity8 ' plans for a space age underwater hotel to @entity11 's plans for the world 's biggest shopping mall			1
how do these announcements stack up against what 's already out there ? we 've compiled 25 of what we think are some of the most impressive engineering / construction achievements to date , taking into consideration the era in which they were built and the knowledge and materials that were available to designers			1
