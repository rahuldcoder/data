in the big scheme of consumer electronics , smartwatches ca n't match smartphones , tablets , or even ultrabooks in piquing public curiosity			0
and glancing at a photo of the @entity8 , you would n't notice anything too different or special about it -- it looks like an understated digital watch			2
but this particular smartwatch has captured the public 's attention to the tune of $ 10 million in @entity17 funding , making it the most - financed project in @entity17 history			1
@entity8 , a smartwatch that wirelessly connects with your smartphone to alert you of incoming calls and messages , blew past the previous @entity17 record of $ 3.3 million only five days after launching its crowdsourced funding effort			1
it 's an amazing feat when you consider just how many big - name smartphone and tablet brands are fighting for the same attention			2
time : @entity8 pre-orders are sold out , $ 10 million pledged what is it about the @entity8 that made it such a breakout success ? how is the small @entity8 team going to put more than $ 10 million to use ? and what , exactly , hides inside this insanely popular piece of hardware ? we took a trip to @entity8 's @entity42 office to find out			1
inside @entity8 r&d @entity8 's headquarters follows the grand tradition of small , @entity47 startups			1
whereas @entity48 started its business in @entity51 ' garage , @entity8 is located on the ground floor of @entity8 founder @entity8 's apartment			1
granted , it 's a nice amount of space			0
there 's plenty of room for several desks , computers , a soldering station , and even a telepresence robot and remote - controlled helicopters			0
but for a $ 10 million operation , it 's still humble			1
of course , the @entity8 team has n't gotten its hands on the money yet			2
the @entity17 campaign officially ends on may 18 , at which point all backers ' credit cards will be charged , and funding will be transferred to @entity8			1
( @entity17 takes a 5 percent cut of the total raised money			2
) but even without cash in hand , @entity8 and team are moving forward with aggressive product development , a move they can make in confidence now that significant public support is in the bag			1
they 're adding new features — water resistance and @entity87 -- and forging new app partnerships to extend the watch 's platform			0
we had an hour of hands - on time with a @entity8 prototype , and found that one of the most impressive features is the watch 's unique display			1
it looks brilliant in direct sunlight and reads like an e-paper display , but refreshes much faster			0
" i love it so much			0
the display is so cool , it 's just this pure black display , " @entity8 said			1
" as soon as i saw it , i knew we had a product			0
" the @entity8 team calls its watch 's display an e-paper display , in order to highlight its readability in direct sunlight			1
the specific component @entity8 uses , however , is @entity116 's 1.26 - inch @entity115			1
this screen does n't use the anti-reflective e-ink that 's so familiar in @entity120 and @entity121 e-readers			0
rather , it 's a reflective display that uses a @entity125 ( @entity124 ) module for improved brightness , and @entity128 ( high - reflective thin film transistor ) technology to add contrast			0
one bit of memory is also embedded into every pixel			0
this makes it possible for each pixel to hold its state without much battery power			0
and with 144 × 168 pixels in such a tiny screen , the result is a sharp , paper - like reading experience with dramatic black levels			0
thanks to the screen 's lower power consumption , the watch 's lithium ion polymer battery can keep going for seven days , @entity8 says			1
but it 's not only the display that makes the @entity8 special			1
the smart , sophisticated design of the watch itself has also inspired public interest			0
it 's not a large , hulking piece of hardware			0
the watch looked a little big on my small wrist , but was significantly less bulky than the @entity163 , a previous smartwatch effort by @entity8 's team			1
before deciding on the @entity8 's final design , the team sketched out a number of other possibilities			1
" you do 10 designs or 20 designs , then you choose three , and then you design 10 more designs around each of those three , and then you choose a path			0
we did that for @entity8 , " @entity8 said			2
now that @entity8 has officially sold out on @entity17 -- for a grand total of 85,000 watch orders -- the team still has a lot of work ahead			1
in its current state , the @entity8 prototype is powered by a circuit board that 's much larger than the watch itself			1
the @entity187 is attached to the watch with a maze of wires , and allows the team to prototype new software and debug the system before commissioning the final miniature board that will go inside the shipping product			0
" it 's much easier to make a board like this -- it took only two weeks -- whereas if we want to make a miniature board it would take a lot longer and cost a lot more , " @entity8 said			1
" if we made a mistake , we 'd have to remake all of them again			0
" the " @entity209 " as @entity8 calls it , executes all the features that you 'll see in the final @entity8			2
there are four buttons , a 3 - axis accelerometer , a vibrating motor , @entity214 2.1 + @entity214 and 4.0 , a microcontroller , and @entity216 of memory			0
@entity8 says the team will design a final , miniature board within the next couple of weeks			2
@entity8 has already ordered more than $ 1 million worth of components for the watch and will be taking a trip to @entity224 soon to visit manufacturers there			1
( yes , your @entity8 will be made in @entity224			2
) this is the part of @entity8 production where @entity8 sees potential problems			2
" the hard part will be the manufacturing process			0
there will be things that will come up , and we 'll have to solve them , " @entity8 said			2
" it could be anything			0
this is our first large - scale manufacturing			0
there will be some problems , guaranteed			0
" while the hardware is impressive , where @entity8 truly shines is in its software			2
@entity8 will be the first smartwatch capable of connecting with @entity48 's @entity245 , a feature that 's helped it reach a mainstream market			1
users will be able to customize their watchfaces to their own personal style , and access a number of built - in notification features for calls , text messages , tweets , e-mails , and weather			0
what 's more , @entity8 is partnering with third - party app developers to create compatible apps			1
the company already announced @entity262 , the popular running and fitness app , as its first official partner			0
you 'll be able to use @entity8 to control the @entity262 app on your @entity245 or @entity269 smartphone			2
@entity270 for bumps in the night @entity8 has also built a partnership with another @entity17 success , @entity274			1
@entity274 , made by @entity275 , is a small box - like device that has built - in @entity278 connectivity , an accelerometer , temperature sensors , and an optional moisture sensor and magnetic switch			0
through a simple web interface , you can configure @entity274 alerts for real - world events			0
and soon @entity274 will connect with @entity8 too			2
for example , you could put @entity274 in your basement during the rainy season and set it to alert your @entity8 if the basement starts flooding			2
the two companies also released a video showing another use case : @entity274 to a door , and when someone knocks — tripping @entity274 's accelerometer — you receive an alert on your @entity8 that someone 's at the door			1
" we believe in connecting many simple objects to do powerful things , and when a common backer of @entity8 's and ours suggested that @entity274 and @entity8 together would be like peanut butter and chocolate , we loved the idea			1
" @entity307 , @entity275 co-founder , told @entity308 in an e-mail			0
" [ @entity8 ] is tinkerer - friendly and a kindred @entity311 spirit ( it even uses the same low - power arm processor [ as @entity274 ] ) and by giving users the ability to incorporate @entity8 into @entity274 rules , the possible applications grow exponentially			0
" the @entity274 partnership only hints at the many ways a @entity8 smartwatch might be useful in people 's day - to - day lives			1
the @entity8 team will make an open software development kit available in august , allowing developers to create more applications for the @entity8 platform			0
@entity8 has already made @entity17 history , but it will be even more exciting to see what becomes of the watch once it begins shipping this september			1
will it be everything that the 67,000 - plus @entity17 backers are expecting ? we wo n't know until we get our hands on one			0
it 's clear , at least , that the @entity8 team is already working hard to make the best possible device for its initial supporters			1
if you slacked off and did n't get around to pre-ordering a @entity8 watch on @entity17 , do n't worry — you 'll eventually be able to order a @entity8 from the company website .			1
