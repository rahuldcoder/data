-- @entity1 has been on a cloning tear recently			1
on thursday , the social media company announced that its photo app @entity5 was adding support for 15 - second videos , a la @entity8 's hit @entity10 app. there are a few minor differences : @entity10 is only 6 seconds ; @entity5 has filters ; vine loops ; @entity5 lets you delete a clip			1
but they are essentially the same tool			0
this is not the first time @entity1 has tried replicating another company 's features			1
it imitated @entity23 with its places check - ins , @entity5 with the @entity26 app , @entity8 with profiles you can follow and @entity29 with the @entity31 app. last week , @entity1 finally added hashtags , another creation started on @entity8 , though the outrage seems to be more that it took so long			1
while perhaps disappointing , it is unsurprising that a minor feature gets so much media coverage ( yes			2
this is my third article on the topic )			0
@entity1 has more than a billion users around the world			2
@entity5 says 130 million people use the photo - sharing service every month , and most will be excited to get a cool new feature like video			1
in just 24 hours , 5 million videos were uploaded to the service , according to @entity5			2
what happens on these tools , even when they are tiny , has an immediate impact on a huge amount of people			1
" @entity1 is a very important company in the world , " said @entity54 , a partner at the @entity56 investment firm			2
" @entity1 does impacts a billion people			1
that in and of itself , becoming a communications platform for a billion people , is a pretty impressive feat in the world			0
" the small features can also have big impacts on the company itself			2
originality is risky , and @entity1 is now a public company tasked with making investors money after a particularly harrowing first year on the stock market			2
for @entity1 , advertising , particularly on mobile devices , is where that money will come from			2
in 2012 , 84 % of @entity1 's revenue came from advertising , and videos are going to play a bigger role in future online advertising revenue			1
there are no paid ads on @entity5 yet , but it is very brand - savvy			2
a handful of major companies seem to have been given early access to the new feature and posted promotional videos on the service			2
major companies to post such videos include @entity90 , the @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			0
the practice of an established company copying successful features is n't new or particular surprising			0
according to @entity98 of @entity100 investment firm @entity99 , this is the same pattern that happened 10 or 12 years ago with @entity102			0
@entity103 would build a cool product for @entity105 , and then @entity102 would copy it			0
borrowing features from other companies and improving on them is part of being competitive			0
" it 's always a threat , but then you see these things break out , " @entity98 said			0
@entity1 's track record has been hit or miss. @entity29 could be one of those breakouts it did n't manage to squash			1
the independent mobile messaging app has grown in popularity while @entity1 's @entity31 app has n't caught on			1
experts say @entity1 's recent spate of arguably ho - hum announcements is n't an accurate representation of @entity100 as a whole			1
many early - stage companies , they say , are taking the big risks and working on technology that will change the world			1
" @entity100 is not just about apps for smartphones and doing a photo - sharing app that has a blue border instead of a red one , " @entity54 said			0
founder 's @entity56 's own @entity135 was an early investor in @entity1 , but the firm is now focused on finding companies with very large barriers to entry that can not be easily be cloned			1
investments include ride - sharing company @entity143 , big data company @entity144 and space - travel company @entity146 it also focuses on companies that are working to solve some of the world 's biggest problems , such as health care and energy			1
" the issue is , from a ( venture capitalist 's ) perspective , we have moved on , " said @entity152 of @entity153			0
" we are working on things that are going to be on the @entity1 level in five to 10 years , but mass media is focused on what 's already big			1
" innovating is n't just for startups			0
both @entity164 and @entity165 have worked on risky products as mature companies , but they are also standing on firmer financial ground			0
once it has appeased investors , perhaps @entity1 will go back to its " hacking " ethos and release something unexpected and new			0
as for the other companies that are busy working on the next big thing , they are n't putting too much energy into organizing press events with @entity179 coffee and amazing baked goods because , for now , their business models do n't require it			1
" the only way to get much , much , much larger is to focus on being really valuable to to the world , " @entity54 said			0
" they 're not doing it for fame ; they 're doing it for a mission			0
... sometimes those things just take a little longer			0

@entity5 's new video feature is the latest imitation feature from @entity1
the minor *updates* are not representative of the innovations happening in @entity100
tech companies are working on big problems like health care and energy
any @entity1 feature , even small , has an impact on a huge number of people
