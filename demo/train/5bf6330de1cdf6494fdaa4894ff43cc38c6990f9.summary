@entity0 , @entity1 -- when all was said and done , @entity3 and @entity4 did not ask the judge for mercy			1
they did not try to extol @entity3 's virtues , list good deeds or express regret			2
instead , they depicted the boys he sexually assaulted as ungrateful and called them liars			2
they blamed the young men -- including their own adopted son , @entity16 , who now claims he , too , was molested -- for their downfall			1
in letters to the judge who would sentence the former coach , the @entity18 portrayed themselves as virtuous victims of a vast conspiracy			1
they blamed powerful , image - conscious forces at @entity26 , lying cops , ambitious prosecutors and a scandal - hungry news media			2
victims angrily confront @entity4 at sentencing the couple 's letters were mentioned in court on tuesday but not read aloud			1
judge @entity37 and the @entity38 courts made them public , and @entity2 obtained copies			2
in them , @entity40 expressed little sympathy for the 10 boys he was convicted of molesting			2
as he wrote about their families , he tried to shift the blame , pointing out that the boys came from unstable homes			2
" nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment , neglect , abuse , insecurity and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this , " he wrote			2
he said nothing about the damaged lives and institutions his molestation case left in its wake			2
@entity65 ) instead , both @entity66 wrote that the justice system let them down			2
just as letters to one of the boys he was accused of molesting helped secure his conviction , the letters to the judge all but guaranteed a maximum punishment , legal observers say			1
@entity37 , who presided over the trial and sentenced @entity4 on tuesday to 30 to 60 years in prison , noted that others wrote letters as well			1
but he indicated that he considered only the @entity83 ' letters in handing down a sentence that , for a 68 - year - old man , is likely to be a life prison term			1
victim to @entity4 : ' because of you , i trust no one ' " sentencing is a time to ask for mercy , not to attack others , " said @entity90 , a former federal prosecutor who teaches legal ethics at @entity92			1
" in my experience , judges really hate letters that try to shift the blame to others or which belittle the victims or the court			1
" @entity103 , an @entity104 attorney who comments on legal matters for @entity2 , agreed that @entity4 did n't do himself any favors			1
" the old adage ' if you ca n't say something nice , do n't say anything at all ' applies to sentencing statements , " @entity103 said			2
" it is awkward when you deny you are culpable and a jury says otherwise			2
for appellate purposes @entity4 was never going to accept responsibility or admit doing something wrong , but lashing out at everyone so strongly was irrational			1
" she added that @entity4 might have thought he was still playing to his @entity26 fan base , but it backfired			1
" between @entity3 and @entity4 's vicious protestations of innocence , " @entity103 said , " all i can think is the victims -- and in particular their son @entity16 -- should shout back the lyrics from the @entity128 song , ' before you accuse me , take a look at yourself			1
' " @entity4 's son comes forward as victim @entity40 bashed victims and laid out the conspiracy theory in a pre-recorded interview leaked to a campus radio station on the eve of his sentencing			1
he hinted at it again when he spoke in court on tuesday , after being warned by his lawyers to avoid criticizing his victims or the justice system			1
his performances on air and in the courtroom were widely derided by prosecutors , legal analysts and commentators as narcissistic , self - absorbed and even more hurtful to the young men he was convicted of molesting			2
@entity40 's letter expanded on the rambling , 15 - minute courtroom soliloquy that touched on everything from the writer @entity158 to " special inmate friends " to wet kisses from dogs			2
like that speech , it was part locker room pep talk and part @entity167 inspirational , with a heaping side order of the @entity170 ballad " my way			2
" he wrote about life in protective custody , and how it led him to think about all the interests that were being protected as the case unfolded : " the system protected the system , the media , the prosecution , the civil attorneys and the accusers			0
everybody protected themselves , " he wrote			0
" @entity26 , with its own system , protected their public image , " he continued			0
" @entity188 protected their jobs and ambitions			0
prosecutors protected their jobs and egos			0
the accusers were protected and provided access to potential financial gain , free attorneys , accolades , psychologists and attention			0
" @entity201 files lawsuit against @entity26 he wrote that he was heartbroken			0
" my trust in people , systems and fairness has diminished , " he said			0
" in my heart i know i did not do these disgusting acts			0
however , i did n't tell the jury			0
our son changed our plans when he switched sides			2
" @entity214 was 18 when he was adopted by the @entity83 after spending time with them in foster care			1
the relationship always has been rocky , but it collapsed near the end of @entity4 's trial in june			1
as the prosecution 's case drew to a close , @entity16 told investigators that @entity4 had molested him , too			1
@entity214 , now 33 , did not testify for either side , but @entity40 insists that his adopted son 's desertion and potentially damaging testimony kept him from testifying in his own defense			1
the @entity83 spared no one			1
" there were so many people involved in the orchestration of this conviction ( media , investigators , prosecutors , " the system , " @entity26 and the accusers			0
) it was well done			0
they won ! " @entity40 wrote , as if a tragic court case about molested children was an epic gridiron contest			0
" when i thought about how it had transpired , i wondered what they had won , " he continued			0
" i thought of the methods , decisions and allegations			0
i relived the inconsistencies and dishonest testimonies			0
" he pondered what would happen if the tables were turned			0
when the hero falls off the pedestal : the emotion of betrayal " what would be the outcome if all the accusers and their families who were investigated ? " he wrote			0
" i knew the answer			0
all their issues would surface			0
they would no longer be these poor , innocent people as portrayed			0
" @entity4 also wrote of her disappointment , saying she has lost faith in the police and the legal system			1
" to think that they can lie and get by with the lies			0
the press has been unbelievable			0
people who have not met us are writing untruths			0
" @entity4 's letter is revealing because she has stood silently by her husband in court			1
she testified at his trial that she never heard or saw anything strange or sexual going on in the basement of their home , where many of the victims say her husband molested them			2
in her letter , she unloaded on her adopted son , @entity16 " people need to know what kind of person he is , " she wrote			1
" we have forgiven him many times for all he has done to our family , thinking that he was changing his life , but he would always go back to his stealing and lies			0
he has been diagnose ( sic ) bipolar , but he refuses to take his medicine			0
" records from @entity38 's probation department and juvenile courts tell part of the story of how @entity16 , as he was known , came to the @entity18			0
like the boys who testified against @entity4 at the trial , @entity16 participated in @entity4 's youth mentoring program , @entity310			1
@entity40 was in @entity311 , preparing for the @entity312 , when @entity16 was arrested in 1995			0
@entity4 called personally and pulled strings to make sure @entity16 was placed under his care and not sent to juvenile detention			1
opinion : for the victims , it 's about more than locking him up the court documents detail @entity16 's continuing troubles , including an aspirin overdose in march 1996 that is characterized as a suicide attempt			2
but he maintained that he wanted to stay in the @entity4 home , writing to the court , " i feel that they have supported me even when i have messed up			1
they are a loving , caring group of people			0
they have showed me what a family is really like			0
" in another instance , @entity4 called police to his house , claiming a burglar was trying to break in			1
it was @entity16 , who said he had come to the house for a power tool			0
@entity214 now is represented by a law firm in @entity341 that is handling the cases of several other @entity4 molestation victims			1
" @entity16 is extremely disappointed that @entity4 and the @entity18 have decided to smear his character in an attempt to deflect attention from @entity40 's heinous crimes , " his lawyers @entity345 and @entity346 said in a written statement to @entity2			1
" @entity16 has shown tremendous courage and strength , " the statement continued			0
" rather than supporting her son when he made the gut - wrenching decision to come forward and tell the truth about the abuse he suffered at the hands of @entity40 , @entity4 has chosen to continue @entity3 's strategy of blaming and attacking the victims , thereby perpetuating the abuse			1
" @entity4 wrote that her adopted son " has had many run - ins with the law and stolen money and items from our family			1
we still love him and want the best for him , but because of his actions we can not express this to him			0
... " @entity374 , a lawyer for @entity4 , did not respond to a request for comment			1
a spokesman for the state attorney general 's office said prosecutors " stand by " what they said tuesday about @entity4 's victim and system bashing			1
the lead prosecutor , @entity384 , described @entity4 's behavior as " banal , self - delusional , completely untethered from reality			1
it was entirely - self - focused , as if he himself were the victim			0
" @entity40 trial : all you need to know about allegations , how case unfolded			0
