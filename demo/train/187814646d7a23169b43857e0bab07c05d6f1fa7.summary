even if the @entity0 backs president @entity2 's call for military action against @entity3 , a wall of outright opposition or skepticism from @entity7 and @entity8 in the @entity9 makes approval there very difficult			1
house speaker @entity12 , who backs @entity2 on the issue , welcomed news on friday that the president would deliver a national address on tuesday to try to sway public opinion , which now opposes such a step			0
but @entity12 's spokesman signaled that the votes are n't in the @entity9 for passing a resolution authorizing force against @entity3 and the @entity8 is placing the burden squarely on @entity2 's shoulders			1
" only a president can convince the public that military action is required			0
we only hope this is n't coming too late to make the difference , " @entity12 spokesman @entity27 said in a statement			0
still , senior @entity9 @entity8 aides find it difficult to see a path for passage			1
@entity12 's top deputy , @entity9 majority leader @entity36 , also supports the president and is talking to members and urging them to review classified materials that administration officials say bolsters their case for military action			1
@entity36 penned an editorial in his hometown @entity45 paper explaining why he believes military action is needed			1
" @entity47 has a compelling national security interest to prevent and respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction , especially by a terrorist state , and to prevent further instability in a region of vital interest to the @entity47 , " he said			2
' constructive ' talks but little headway on crisis but rank and file @entity9 @entity8 members have frequently ignored their leaders and the vote in favor of action is stalled in the single digits , including the support expressed by senior leadership , a @entity59 tally showed			1
one senior @entity9 aide said prospects for meaningful additional @entity8 support is " bad " and " momentum is with the ' nay ' vote			1
" @entity74 is ending its summer recess and members formally get back to work next week			2
in a memo to @entity78 outlining the fall schedule , @entity36 suggested the timetable for the vote , which @entity12 initially planned for next week , could slip a week			1
" members should expect a robust debate and vote on an authorization of use of military force pertaining to @entity3 in the next two weeks " @entity36 wrote			1
but @entity9 @entity8 leaders are leaving open the possibility the @entity9 will not bring up the resolution if it fails in the @entity0			1
senate majority leader @entity91 predicted on friday that the necessary votes were in the @entity94 - led chamber to pass a resolution calling for limited force			1
the @entity9 plans to wait to see if something passes the @entity0 before making final decisions on the language or timing of any @entity9 vote , according to multiple @entity8 sources			1
one undecided @entity8 member , rep @entity103 , a @entity105 @entity8 , returned for a briefing on friday			0
he told @entity59 that he came back to hear details about the military objectives directly from the administration instead of through the media			0
@entity2 to address @entity47 people on tuesday although his constituents are " very opposed " to military action , @entity103 said he would base his vote on what he thought was best for the country and " let the politics sort itself out later			0
" the lack of @entity8 support places enormous pressure on @entity123 @entity122 , who was one of the chief critics of the @entity126 war , and @entity94 whip @entity127			0
the two will need to persuade well over a majority of the @entity7 to stand behind @entity2 , also a @entity130			0
@entity132 @entity94 aides counter that it 's too soon to predict defeat because most @entity7 are reserving judgment until they hear details in a classified briefing on monday evening			2
the administration is dispatching top officials to make a final push before @entity2 's speech			0
secretary of state @entity142 ; secretary of defense @entity144 , national security adviser @entity146 , director of national intelligence @entity147 , and @entity150 chairman @entity149 will conduct the joint @entity9 - @entity0 session in the @entity152			1
" we 're not going to know until our members get back into town			0
a lot of people have n't had access to the briefings or the classified documents , " one of @entity94 aide noted			2
but for many @entity9 members who already have attended classified meetings on @entity3 this week , the sessions seem to raise more questions			1
@entity3 's rebels : 20 things you need to know @entity170 , a former @entity126 war veteran , told reporters she was undecided and then ticked off remaining questions she had after a two - hour session with top administration officials			2
" what are the unintended consequences ? what are the outcomes ? what are the next moves that could potentially occur that would involve @entity47 interests , @entity47 military , costs - both in human lives , as well as in resources ? " @entity170 asked			0
a senior administration official told @entity59 that top officials reached out to more than 125 @entity9 members through a variety of conference calls and one - on - one conversations over the past two weeks			1
but the " flood the zone " @entity194 approach has n't prevented a steady list of members from voicing outright opposition or criticism that the case for military action is thin			2
the fact that so many members in his own party remain undecided or publicly opposed illustrates that @entity2 's political capital in @entity74 is quite low			0
@entity208 @entity94 rep. @entity207 participated in a conference call with @entity194 chief of staff @entity210 on wednesday and remains undecided			0
while she said there 's no question that the @entity215 government used chemical weapons she outlined a laundry list of outstanding questions			1
she wants details about contingency plans if @entity3 retaliates , the lack of international support , reasons why diplomatic efforts ca n't be explored , and the direct cost to taxpayers			2
@entity227 says her constituents " overwhelmingly ... want me to vote ' no ' on this			0
" she described @entity9 @entity7 as " war weary			2
we just came from @entity126 and @entity232 wars			0
we are war skeptical , " @entity227 said			0
rep @entity234 , a @entity236 @entity130 who remained undecided , highlighted the stakes for @entity2 to change minds or persuade @entity7 to back him on @entity3			2
he called it " certainly one of the most important speeches in his career as the president of the @entity47			0
