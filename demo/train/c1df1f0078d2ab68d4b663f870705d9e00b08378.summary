-- who was the last male monarch who had not previously been @entity3 ? do n't know the answer off the top of your head ? neither did @entity9 , who ended his 11 - game winning streak on @entity12 ! wednesday night when he incorrectly answered the final question of the night			1
@entity9 lost to @entity14 , someone who the controversial @entity12 ! star calls " a bit devious " ( in a good way )			1
we caught up with him over the phone to see how he 's feeling , who his favorite movie villain is , and who he took some selfies with before heading back home to @entity25			1
what happened [ wednesday ] night ? well , i lost			1
i think @entity28 actually pointed it out ; he saw how i was feeling that day			2
i was really fatigued , and i was sort of losing my mojo			2
and @entity14 , to her credit , picked up on the strategy i was using , and she used it herself to great effect			2
you said she picked up on your strategy â € ” was she the first competitor to do that ? other people tried to do it , but i think some people were n't prepared to play in a way different than they 'd practiced			2
@entity14 had the advantage that she watched me for a whole day before having to play because she was an alternate the day before , and so she had that time to prepare and she 's also a little bit devious			2
she 's a very clever person , i hope she does well in her future games			2
you have this title as a @entity12 ! villain , do you remember the first time you saw a mention of that in media ? there was someone who wrote a tweet , i think they were being tongue - in - cheek , they posted a picture of my face and were like , ' this is the face of a @entity12 ! villain , can anyone stop him ? ' and that meme sort of ran out of control			1
@entity0 : ' jeopardy ! ' champ @entity9 's winning streak ends -- video you 've humorously embraced that title of villain			1
did it get to you at first , or was your initial reaction , " oh , that 's funny " ? it 's really more of an antihero thing			2
people are saying , antiheroes are big now , people say i 'm the @entity78 of @entity12 ! , or like i was @entity79 !			1
it was something that made @entity12 ! different for a while and i think a lot of people appreciated that			1
there was this awesome video by these @entity87 animators that shows me as literally a super villain with super powers			2
i said , that justifies this whole media thing by itself			0
if you could be any tv or movie villain , who would you be ? i always sympathize with @entity96 in @entity97 because it totally was like , if you do n't have super powers , why not use your brain to try to figure out a way to give yourself super powers ? i do n't see why that 's a bad thing			2
@entity103 might have just been much naturally better than me at @entity12 , but should n't we be encouraging people that if you do n't necessarily have the natural talents to exceed at something without trying , than succeed at it by trying			1
so the fact that @entity97 showed the bad guy @entity96 as evil because he wanted to give everyone the chance to have super powers , that never sat well with me			0
i see it from the other perspective : if you can use your brain , and figure out inventions or tricks to compensate for your natural disadvantages , that 's what science is about , that 's what progress is about			0
so do you have any natural talents ? [ @entity129 ] there 's no way to get money in @entity12 ! without knowing the answers to questions			1
but it 's just like any other sport			0
it 's not just about athletics , it 's about the playbook			0
everyone who plays in the @entity140 is good enough to play in the @entity140 for the most part , and then it comes down to which team was better coached , which team had the better strategy going into the game , which team used their resources most effectively			2
and i do n't see a game show as being any different			1
who could you tell about your winning streak after the taping ? i ended up telling my family over @entity155 , because i had to explain why i could afford to buy my brother a tv			1
[ @entity129 ] a lot of my friends said they were sure that i 'd lost on my first episode ; they said they were sure the way i was promoting it , like telling everybody to come watch it with me , like , ' that must have been his only game , he must want people to support him			2
' [ @entity129 ] @entity0 : public service announcement : it 's time to cram for the ' jeopardy ! ' online test what category would you ace , no question ? [ @entity129 ] a category on , let 's see , text adventure computer games from the 1980s			0
i would smoke that category			0
that 's something i know way too much about compared to how important it is in life , but that 's one of my expert categories			0
what entertainment are you into , what are you watching ? my wife and i really liked @entity188 is the @entity189 , we really liked @entity190 on @entity191 , and @entity192 , also on @entity191			0
actually , one of the best things about @entity192 is this quote , where there 's a character named @entity198 , and he says this awesome thing that i wish i 'd thought of it earlier			0
but this would be my quote for people who do n't like watching me play on @entity12 : ' that sounds like a ' you ' problem , like a @entity9 problem			1
' so that 's my tagline			0
do you talk to @entity14 ? i messaged her on monday , saying , ' are you ready for what the media is going to do to you on wednseday ? ' because i had n't anticipated the story about me would blow up so big			0
and she was like , ' no , i have no idea what to do ! i 'm freaking out ! ' and i was like , ' you 'll be fine			0
' [ @entity129 ] what was really cool was that i happened to run into her mom and her best friend in the airport when i was going to fly back to @entity25 after the taping and they actually , they had nothing but good things to say			0
we took some selfies and everything and it was cool			0
so how are you feeling ? obviously , i wish i had gone on to be @entity103			1
but we ca n't all be @entity103			1
in fact , the evidence suggests most of us ca n't be @entity103			1
i do n't know how he did it			0
i like to think i 'm the best mere mortal in @entity12 !			1
there 's @entity230 , then there is @entity103 , who is n't human			1
it 's like if we were doing basketball rankings , i 'd be the best normal basketball player in history and then you 'd have @entity238 and you know , @entity103 would be like , @entity240 or something			1
you 're like the the @entity12 ! champion of the people , basically			1
i 've had people say that			0
they 're like , @entity103 seemed like he was n't trying , it seemed like it was easy for him			1
whereas for you , this guy was saying to me , for you it seemed like you struggled a lot			0
so it was much more human , it made me feel like i could do that			0
and i was like , that 's the message i want to send to people			0
