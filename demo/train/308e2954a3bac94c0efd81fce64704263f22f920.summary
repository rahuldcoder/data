-- @entity1 , 40 , was born in @entity2 , where she is now a banking technology consultant , as well as running a company that offers " offbeat sightseeing tours " of six @entity7 cities , including @entity2 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity10 : " when you live in @entity2 you feel like you 're in the nerve center of the country			2
" @entity1 's @entity2 tours take in the city 's bazaars , backstreets and culture and her blog , @entity20 , is a personal view of life in the city			1
@entity0 : how does @entity2 compare to those other cities your company offers tour of ? @entity1 : @entity2 is a very young city by @entity7 standards , only 500 years old , whereas a city like @entity8 is really ancient			1
@entity2 used to be a fishing hamlet and it grew after the @entity31 arrived			2
so it 's a young city and one that has been formed by migrants			2
almost everyone in @entity2 has arrived here in the course of the last few generations , and so the city has a vibrancy and cosmopolitanism that is different from other cities			1
@entity0 : what makes @entity2 special to you ? @entity1 : the fact that i am so grounded here -- i was born here and four generations of my family live here			1
but also , @entity2 is on the move , it 's vibrant , it 's accepting of change and it 's got a very active citizenry			1
it 's the one place where you can make a mark , where you can make a difference			2
when you live in @entity2 you feel like you 're in the nerve center of the country			2
you feel like all the big events are near you and you 're connected to everything			0
in other cities i tend to feel more remote			0
if there 's a new play it premieres in @entity2 , if there 's a new band they play in @entity2 -- everything happens here			1
we 're close to the center of commerce and i would rather be close to the center of commerce than the center of politics ! what makes @entity2 special to you ? let us know @entity0 : what are your favorite parts of the city ? @entity1 : i think my favorite is a place called @entity83			1
it 's the " native " bazaar area that sprang up outside the old @entity31 fort			0
it 's got a certain colorful energy and retains its 18th century - feel to some extent			0
everything under the sun can be bought there ; it 's got a spice market , a jewelry market			0
it 's a busy , bustling area where a lot of trade happens , so i love it			0
@entity0 : where do people go if they want to escape @entity2 's bustle ? @entity1 : we head out of the city -- we run for the hills ! we go to the @entity102 , which is a mountain range that runs parallel to the coast , barely a two - hour drive from where i live			1
" there 's climbing and a whole bunch of very interesting mountain forts to explore ; there 's whitewater rafting , paragliding , cycling			0
ecologically , it 's a very bio-diverse area so it attracts photography enthusiasts and bird watchers			0
we 're very lucky that we 're so close to it			0
we also have a lot of beaches just outside the city and they are popular as well			0
within the city there are little enclaves of peace -- even in @entity83 market there are temple complexes where there 's a surprising silence compared to the bustle of the streets			1
we also have our seaside promenades where we love to hang out			0
the young , who have no other place to go , find romance on @entity137 and @entity138			0
it 's @entity2 's version of @entity140 -- except the lane is wide open ! @entity0 : what 's a typical weekend in @entity2 ? @entity1 : we party quite hard , so saturday and sunday evenings are days when you go out with friends and family			1
there are a huge number of restaurants with all sorts of cuisines on offer			0
there are some great clubs -- my favorite right now is a place called @entity159 -- and there 's an active cultural scene			1
alongside all the partying we 're all in a mad race to lose weight and look good			0
@entity165 is helping men wake up to the fact that there 's nothing wrong with a well - toned physique			0
in all the suburbs of @entity2 there 's a mushrooming of places where young guys are pumping iron and trying to be ' he - men			1
' @entity0 : do you think the city 's changed since the terrorist attacks last november ? @entity1 : yes , i think there 's a hardening of stances and an unwillingness to accept platitudes			1
i also think there is increased uneasiness between communities			0
@entity0 : has tourism been affected by the attacks ? @entity1 : my own business went bust for two weeks			1
for two weeks i had nothing but cancellations in @entity2 and i was only saved by the fact that i was doing business in other cities			1
but then business picked up again			0
my first clients after the attacks were a @entity205 @entity204 couple and i was heartened by the faith and support they showed for @entity2			2
@entity2 also gets big tour groups that arrive by bus and i think that kind of group tour has lessened , but my business gets more independent travelers and they are still coming			2
people choose to respond to crises more positively than we think they will and i 'm seeing very strong individual responses			0
@entity0 : if @entity2 was a person what would he or she be like ? @entity1 : this is a city which is strangely beautiful and strangely warty			1
at its heart this city is about money , it 's a city of exchange and commerce , so it would be a trader or a wheeler dealer -- someone who 's on the move , making deals and making money !			2

@entity1 lives in @entity2 , where her company runs " offbeat sightseeing tours "
she says @entity2 is younger and more cosmopolitan than most @entity7 cities
people in the city party hard , she says -- and there 's an active cultural scene
last november 's terrorist attacks have increased tension in the city , she says
