-- in the blink of an eye , @entity1 has emerged as one of the most esteemed companies in the @entity6 , soaring in recent days to a market value of $ 18.2 billion			1
that 's bigger than @entity9 and @entity10 combined			0
but is the @entity1 story really as good as it seems ? taxicab drivers clogging the streets of @entity14 this past week , protesting against @entity1 , are only part of the challenge			1
far more dangerous could be an emerging pattern of not paying sufficient respect to customers			0
companies like @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 are passionately committed to building a love affair with consumers as the center of their universe			2
in contrast , @entity1 has embraced a take - it - or - leave - it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul			1
still , the business model is brilliant , the growth eye - popping and the initial @entity1 experience is generally excellent			1
in big cities like @entity37 , on a rainy night , when cabs are always full , finding an @entity1 car quickly through your @entity40 can be a godsend , even though you may have to pay a " surge price " at a multiple of twice or even more of the regular price			2
this adds up to @entity1 being a welcome disruption , blowing competition and free market pricing into the regulated taxi industries that do n't always serve the interests of consumers			1
so what are the dangers ? lack of transparency may be one			0
consumers usually want a company to be proactive about explaining what they do and how that can affect their lives , especially when physical safety is at stake			2
@entity1 puts most of the meaningful detail on what service it actually provides into its @entity67 , which most people do n't read when they download the app. according to its @entity70 , @entity1 is not a transportation service			2
it 's a passenger procurement service for private car drivers			2
the car drivers are @entity1 's actual customers			1
lack of accountability may be another danger			0
the entire risk of using the service is on the passenger			0
you are warned that you could be exposed to situations that are " potentially dangerous , offensive , harmful to minors or unsafe "			0
surprisingly , @entity1 does not claim to " assess the suitability , legality or ability " of any third party providing services procured through @entity1 , and @entity87 drivers may not be professionally licensed or permitted			1
does all this mean you may have a hard time suing the company if your driver is negligent and you get hurt ? @entity97 , @entity1 's spokesman , did n't directly address this question of liability when i asked him about it in an email , but points to company attention to passenger safety , noting @entity1 is " the first to ensure end - to - end insurance coverage for ridesharing			1
" @entity107 is also a concern for consumers			0
as we saw with the fallout from the @entity114 data security breach ( which included the @entity116 resignation ) , people expect a company to protect their privacy			0
i am sure there are fellow riders who , like me , take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the @entity67 or privacy policy for the app. to me this raises further concerns : what are @entity1 's rating criteria for passengers , what happens to the data , how can i see the data on me , what 's the dispute process if i disagree ? @entity1 's @entity97 answered by writing " rider ratings are available easily by visiting t.uber.com / support or just by asking your driver			1
" sounds fair enough , but on their support site i was asked to submit an email request for my passenger rating and wait for a response			0
( i did receive it monday afternoon			0
) and , again , i may not be alone feeling more than a little uncomfortable asking my driver for my rating			0
@entity1 's blog says it is " exploring ways to show the rider 's rating in the next generation of the app "			1
in addition to the security of corporate data , there is the issue of whether individual drivers have access to personal passenger information and how @entity1 protects riders from unauthorized breaches			1
when asked about this in an email , @entity97 , responded : " @entity1 driver partners do not have access to any personal information through the platform , including credit card data			2
we use state - of - the - art anonymization technology , meaning the driver does n't keep a record of the rider 's phone number			0
drivers and riders are able to connect either by calling or texting , with the anonymization described above , in place			0
" from a logical standpoint , this makes sense , but from a brand standpoint they have yet to tell me that protecting my safety and privacy is crucial			0
and then there 's change			0
consumers both love and fear disruptive companies like @entity1			1
people know that innovative companies create constructive chaos that usually benefits consumers			0
but disruptive companies can also be seen as dangerous			0
for @entity1 to get the value of its disruption , in the form of consumer goodwill , people will need to know why @entity1 - instigated changes in the taxi industry are good , not bad			1
despite the surge in rider sign - ups during the @entity14 taxi driver protests last week , @entity1 's challenge will be answering the same questions raised here , as more and more new people come online to use its platform			1
but the taxi driver action also creates the perfect context for @entity1 to explain why shaking up the regulatory environment -- and the ensuing mess -- is a good thing for both consumer and regulator			1
if i were advising @entity1 on how to best achieve revenues that would justify its $ 18 billion valuation , i 'd focus on two things			1
first , get very sharp about what you stand for and start building bridges with consumers that go beyond the functional role of delivering things from point a to @entity233 above the kitten delivery stunts and bull - in - a - china - shop attitude to establish the value of your company in consumers ' lives			2
that suggests being more transparent , protective , inclusive and explanatory about your business and the impact of your actions on their safety , privacy and overall riding experience			0
second , turn the negative fallout from disruption -- from forcing @entity1 's model on municipalities and shaking up the status quo -- into a positive global movement			1
explain to the entire ecosystem of drivers , riders , regulators , regulated , investors and employees the value and benefit of the turmoil @entity1 brings when it rolls out in new markets			1
investors have spoken , and they 're all in for @entity1			2
but the jury may still be out with consumers			0
i happen to love @entity1			2
but if @entity1 does n't seize this moment to build a valuable , trusted position in my life , and move beyond the emerging dangers , i will become a consumer who is confused about what it stands for			1
this requires @entity1 to develop a true brand to manage its disruption and take control of the conversation with consumers			1
it must bring context to the chaos it creates and be known as a positive force for change that always acts on behalf of its consumers , not its business model			2
otherwise , down the road , a competitor might more easily turn my head : one that delivers exactly what they promise me .			0
