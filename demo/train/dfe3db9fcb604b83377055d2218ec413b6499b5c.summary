@entity0 , @entity1 -- before the protests of tuition hikes last week , a colleague posted the following : " need suggestions for protest songs			1
we have a @entity10 but need to give her a play list			0
" the requests started coming in : @entity14 , the @entity15 , @entity16			0
i wondered about the overlap between songs on a professor 's play list and those on a student 's			1
so i went to class and asked students to tell me what they wanted to hear			2
the list included @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , among many others			0
this is the protest play list of a new generation			1
my introduction to protest songs came through my mom			1
as the daughter of a chicano movement activist , i attended protests against wars in @entity42 and rallies in response to police repression			0
last week , i marched in solidarity with people across 17 states calling for well - funded , accessible public education			1
while at the march 4 rally , i realized that @entity1 's public education system has had a great impact on who my mother and i are today			1
as a 15 - year - old immigrant newly arrived in @entity57 , my mother was placed in remedial classes because she did n't speak @entity59			1
she struggled with the language but excelled in math. yet her high school counselor directed her to work at a local tortilla factory			2
this was the early 1960s , just a few years before students responded to educational inequities through organized acts of civil disobedience that would later be referred to as the @entity70 blowouts			2
it was only by chance , and without parental or institutional guidance , that my mom enrolled in @entity74			2
like many other low - income and working students , community college was her entry into higher education			1
it was not until her mid- 30s that she enrolled in the @entity81 of @entity57 while working full time			1
i was in elementary school and remember going to campus with her on days that my dad was working , even during an in - class exam			0
this was my first exposure to a university classroom			0
since then , i have taught at the @entity81 of @entity57 and the @entity90			1
i am currently an assistant professor at @entity91			0
watching preschool teachers and children participating in the recent marches reminded me that my education began at @entity96			0
my mom enrolled me in this program , which provided early reading and math skills and set a foundation for my educational development			0
i stand in solidarity with early childhood educators			0
at the protest , i watched high school students confidently take the stage and list their demands and hopes for a better future			1
i wish that my mom , as a teenage immigrant , could have aired her own frustrations with the 1960s educational system			0
today 's high school students inspire me , and i am proud of today 's teachers , who support their students			1
i ran into some of my own students at the rally			1
one asked where she could hear the @entity10 playing her song request			0
we searched through the sea of people and realized the turnout was much larger than we had imagined			0
the protest play lists of multiple generations filled the air with music			0
young fans of @entity28 marched and chanted alongside older fans of @entity14			0
they all recognized the need for well - funded , accessible public education			2
rising student fees have placed barriers between thousands of eligible students and their dreams of higher education			1
in addition , budget cuts and the subsequent elimination of course offerings have extended the number of years necessary to graduate			0
many of my students have taken on multiple jobs to finance their education			2
i hear their stories and imagine my mom trying to attend @entity149 today			2
younger generations in the @entity151 have consistently achieved a higher level of education than the generation that came before			1
but for the first time since @entity157 , we are in danger of reversing that trend			0
students and educators view education as a public good available to all and will continue mobilizing to restore funding for public education			2
will they receive support or will education become a luxury available to fewer and fewer people ? the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			1

@entity173 : protest songs at education rally ranged from old school to *hip* hop
@entity173 : *whichever* generation , all were fighting for accessible , *affordable* higher education
*writer* 's mom immigrated to @entity57 at 15 and went to college ; she could n't afford it today
rising fees keep thousands of eligible students from realizing their dreams , she says
