even a boy of @entity3 's age knew that militias and soldiers slaughtered men , women and children in the vast , flat expanse of southern @entity19			1
so he ran , too			0
that attack separated @entity3 from his mother and father and cast him into a childhood of desolation			1

there @entity3 would pursue his dream of becoming a catholic priest			1
he would also learn that his mother was alive after all -- and they would reunite 16 years after last seeing each other			0

" @entity3 joined an exodus of southern @entity19 , victims of a war that pitted a northern government of @entity71 against black southerners who follow @entity39 or traditional religions			1
the war also involved fighting between rival southern factions			0

" in those days , i saw many dead people for the first time in my life , " @entity3 wrote in 2001 , before he had perfected his @entity98			1
" some wild animals which were friends to us before and ever , such as hyena , leopard , cat , fox , rat and etc. became the good eaters of flesh			0
" @entity3 says he and the others had so little food and water that he drank his own urine and ate soft mud to survive			1
" people were dying while i was watching them			0
there was nothing i could do			0
i did n't have food			0
i did n't have water , " @entity3 says			1
" when i look back , my question always is ' how did i make it ? who was taking care of me ? i realize now that @entity125 was taking care of me			0
" as refugees streamed from @entity19 into @entity129 , aid workers noticed thousands of boys , many near death , traveling without parents			0
news accounts from the time describe " dying young boys " and " walking skeletons			0
" the @entity137 counted 17,000 " unaccompanied minors " -- mostly boys -- among 250,000 refugees in three @entity129 camps in 1990			1
aid workers and journalists dubbed them the " lost boys of @entity19 " after the characters in " @entity147 , " who were cast as children into the world of adults			0
during @entity3 's time in @entity129 , he says , he asked the rebel @entity154 to give him military training so he could defend himself if he returned to @entity19			1

an @entity176 priest named father @entity177 gave him a purple , plastic rosary that @entity3 says he wore around his neck nearly every day for the next several years			1

" most of the young men had never held an ice cube , written a check or seen tall buildings , but they would get just a few months ' assistance before they had to find jobs and support themselves			0
@entity3 's new life started at 3:51 p.m. on july 18 , 2001 , when @entity192 flight 1905 landed in @entity0 , @entity1			1
a caseworker for the nonprofit @entity194 drove him to a hotel room , where @entity3 turned on a tv tuned to @entity2			1
" well , senator , " a voice was suddenly saying , " if you believe that life begins at conception , how can you then favor embryonic stem cells ? " @entity3 found work at a college cafeteria but soon followed rumors of a better job to @entity207 , @entity208			1
he arrived , saw snow for the first time and got a phone call that started to unravel the mystery of what had happened to his family			0
the caller said he was @entity216 's long - lost brother			2

his brother passed along a tip that they might be in the @entity19 capital , @entity239			0
so @entity3 says he sent a friend $ 100 to go there and ask around			2

on july 12 , 2002 , the friend called with news : @entity3 's mother was alive			1
soon @entity3 dialed a phone number and the woman who answered asked who was calling at five in the morning			2
" your son , " @entity3 said			2
after the @entity256 wrote about @entity3 re-connecting with his mother , a woman in suburban @entity0 who did not even know the young man paid for him to fly to @entity259 to reunite with the mother he had not seen in 16 years			1
