where did our country go ? americans are known around the world as a good and compassionate people -- with a soft spot for children			2
and , although you would n't know it from watching a ghastly detention drama currently playing out in the @entity12 , law enforcement and the legal system have built - in safeguards that acknowledge the simple fact that children are different from adults , and thus can not be treated the same			1
the @entity17 and @entity18 seem to have forgotten that			0
these agencies are currently warehousing hundreds of children from @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 who have , in recent months , streamed across the @entity27 border			1
according to media reports , the group is a mixture of unaccompanied minors sent by their parents , toddlers traveling with their mothers , and children who are alone and trying to reunite with their parents in the @entity37			1
these youngsters are a long way from home and many appear to have gotten this far by jumping aboard passenger trains that run from the @entity27 - @entity22 border to the northern cities of @entity27 , and then joining up with " coyotes " ( smugglers ) who brought them across or , in some cases , merely pointed the way			2
once they arrived , they were taken into custody by @entity37 immigration officials			1
according to immigration attorneys who represent some of these children , many are being held in freezing holding cells intended for fewer inhabitants and shorter stays			1
these are n't jail cells as much as temporary holding rooms nicknamed " hieleras , " or ice chests			0
@entity63 has reported that the border facilities lack " enough food , beds or sanitary facilities to provide for the children			1
" these are the lucky ones			0
federal immigration officials have loaded hundreds of others on buses and transported them across state lines , only to drop them at bus stations in states like @entity76 with nothing more than a notice to appear before an immigration judge -- a scribbled piece of paper representing a feeble attempt at accountability , which most of these people are likely to ignore as they wander off and fade into society			1
president @entity87 called it " an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response			1
" and homeland security secretary @entity91 said his department other agencies would work together to ensure a " rapid government - wide response in the short - term and to undertake broader , longer - term reforms to address the root cause behind these recent migration trends			0
" anyone still think the border is -- as president @entity87 and other administration officials have repeatedly assured us -- more secure than it ever has been ? it 's a mess			1
@entity37 officials do n't have the faintest idea of what to do with the influx , even though they had advanced warning that this crisis was coming			1
@entity27 gov. @entity111 told radio host @entity112 this week that public safety officials in his state had informed the federal government about a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border as early as 2012			1
the @entity17 appears to have not adequately addressed the problem			0
and now , with more than 1,000 children coming across the border every day according to government reports , it must			1
why are they coming ? they 're fleeing countries like those in @entity127 that are quite literally falling apart , with little or failed infrastructure in the military or law enforcement , and thus unable to fend off encroachment by @entity134 drug cartels looking for new outposts from which to operate			2
that is the best theory about why the surge is occurring			0
the most far - fetched theory comes from restrictionists and nativists who insist that what enticed these children from @entity127 to cross the @entity37 - @entity27 border is an expectation that @entity87 is poised to use his executive power to grant a kind of " amnesty " to millions of undocumented			1
if people in @entity127 believe that , they could be the only folks in this hemisphere who do			2
@entity87 has never been particularly interested in proposing an immigration reform plan to @entity151			1
and he has spent the last few years resisting calls to use executive power to act unilaterally to stop deportations			0
@entity156 majority leader @entity155 had taken just about every position one can take on the immigration issue , but recently said he would work with @entity87 to allow undocumented young people to stay in the @entity37			1
now that has been defeated in the primary election by a conservative in his home district in @entity166 , immigration reform is all but dead			2
besides , from all appearances , the border kids are n't immigrants			0
they 're here because they could n't be anywhere else , and they had no choice but to come			0
we 're supposed to take in people like this , and offer them safe haven			0
this country has a right to protect its borders , and to decide who enters and who does n't			2
but once our officials apprehend and take custody of a group of people -- let alone a group of children -- they 're responsible to do right by them			2
that is n't happening in the @entity12			0
we have standards , and procedures , and hoops to jump through for those who might claim refugee status			0
we do n't just drop human beings at a bus station , and run in the other direction			0
there are nations that would handle a situation like this in such a cowardly manner			0
this is n't one of them			0
so where did our country go ? and how do we get it back ?			0

@entity210 : detention of children from @entity127 at border is *beneath* @entity37
he says immigration officials keep them in *inhumane* conditions or bus them to @entity76
@entity210 : nativists are *wrong* to say it 's part of an @entity87 amnesty plan
he says @entity37 has a right to protect its borders , but this is *unconscionable*
