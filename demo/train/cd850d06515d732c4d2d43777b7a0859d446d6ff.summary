" she continued , " everything is worth it -- the hard work , the times when you 're tired , the times when you are a bit sad			0
in the end , it 's all worth it because it really makes me happy			0
i would n't trade it for anything else in the world			0
i 've got good friends , a beautiful family and i 've got a career			0
i thank @entity124 for his blessings every single chance i get			0
