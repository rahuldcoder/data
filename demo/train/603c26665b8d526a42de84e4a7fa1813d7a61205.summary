@entity0 -- @entity3 's launch of the @entity5 -- hampered by technical difficulties and cost overruns -- has been delayed until the fall of 2011 , @entity3 officials said at a news conference thursday in @entity0			1

the mission had been scheduled for launch in the fall of 2009			0
the @entity5 is a large , nuclear - powered rover designed to traverse long distances with a suite of onboard scientific instruments aboard			1
it is , according to @entity3 's web site , part of a " long - term effort of robotic exploration " established to " study the early environmental history of @entity25 " and assess whether @entity25 has ever been -- or still is -- able to sustain life			1
the delay of the launch , according to @entity3 , is due to a number of " testing and hardware challenges that must ( still ) be addressed to ensure mission success			1
" " the progress in recent weeks has not come fast enough on solving technical challenges and pulling hardware together , " said @entity33 , director of @entity3 's @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36			1
changing to a 2011 launch " will allow for careful resolution of any remaining technical problems , proper and thorough testing , and avoid a mad dash to launch , " argued @entity3 associate administrator @entity40			1
the overall cost of the @entity5 is now projected to be roughly $ 2.1 billion , according to @entity3 spokesman @entity47			1
the project originally carried a price tag of $ 1.6 billion			2
@entity3 's entire budget for the current fiscal year , according to @entity52 , is approximately $ 15 billion			1
according to @entity3 , the @entity25 rover will use new technologies and be engineered to explore greater distances over rougher terrain than previous missions to the planet			1
this will be done in part by employing a new surface propulsion system			0
" failure is not an option on this mission , " @entity40 said			0
" the science is too important and the investment of @entity68 taxpayer dollars compels us to be absolutely certain that we have done everything possible to ensure the success of this flagship planetary mission			0
" @entity40 asserted that , based on the agency 's preliminary evaluations , additional costs tied to the delay of the @entity5 launch would not result in the cancellation of other @entity3 programs over the next two years			1
he did , however , concede that it would result in other unspecified program delays			0
critics have charged that the delay and cost overruns associated with the @entity5 are indicative of an agency that is plagued by a lack of accountability and inefficiency in terms of its management of both time and taxpayer dollars			2
" the @entity5 is only the latest symptom of a @entity3 culture that has lost control of spending , " wrote @entity93 , a former @entity3 associate administrator , in a november 24 op - ed in the @entity94			2
" a cancer is overtaking our space agency : the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects			0
" @entity93 charged that the agency 's cost overruns are being fueled by " managers who disguise the size of cost increases that missions incur " and " members of @entity111 who accept steep increases to protect local jobs			2
" @entity52 replied in a written statement saying that @entity3 administrators are " constantly working to improve ( the agency 's ) cost - estimating capabilities			2
... we continually review our projects to understand the true risk in terms of performance , cost and schedule			0
" " the fact of life at @entity3 , where we are charged with creating first - of - a - kind missions of scientific discovery , is that estimating the costs of ... science can be almost as difficult as actually doing the science , " @entity52 said			0
@entity3 's most recent @entity25 project -- the mission of the @entity134 -- came to an end last month after the solar - powered vehicle 's batteries ran down as the result of a dust storm and the onset of @entity25 winter			1
it had operated two months beyond its initial three - month mission			0
@entity3 officials had landed the vehicle on an arctic plain after satellite observations indicated there were vast quantities of frozen water in that area , most likely in the form of permafrost			0
they thought such a location would be a promising place to look for organic chemicals that would signal a habitable environment			0
scientists were able to verify the presence of water - ice in the @entity25 subsurface , find small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life , and observe snow descending from the clouds , @entity3 said thursday .			0
