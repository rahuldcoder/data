@entity0 -- former president @entity2 says that @entity3 , his wife and the prohibitive favorite for the @entity6 nomination for president in 2016 , needs time to not only decide whether she will run , but what she would bring to the race if she did			1
in an interview with @entity1 in @entity11 , @entity2 said that although @entity3 has n't asked him for advice on her 2016 decision , he thinks that the former secretary of state " really does need some time to think through this			1
" " we 've reached a point in our life when we think you really should n't run for office if you do n't have a clear idea of what you can do and a unique contribution you can make and you can outline that , " @entity2 told @entity1 's @entity16			1
" now that the book is done , she wants time to think about that and work through it			0
i think so much of politics is background noise , and we do n't need the background noise anymore			0
" the former president was in @entity11 as part of the @entity34 's work on global health in @entity36			0
@entity3 's latest memoir , " @entity38 , " published earlier this summer to much fanfare and a frenetic book tour			1
while sales of the 600 - page - plus tome have not hit publishers ' expectations , the book tour has put @entity3 on the forefront of political conversation and raised the specter of her likely bid for the presidency in two years			2
@entity3 has also become more comfortable with acknowledging that she is considering a run at the presidency during the book tour			1
while months ago @entity2 would not entertain questions about a run , more recently she has answered questions without pretense and speculated about what her campaign would look like			2
" we have to make a campaign about what we would do , " @entity3 said about a possible 2016 run last week			1
" you have to run a very specific campaign that talks about the changes you want to make in order to tackle growth , which is the handmaiden of inequality			0
" @entity2 ' fine ' with her decision either way @entity2 told @entity16 that he is " fine " with whatever decision @entity3 eventually comes to on 2016			1
the former president did say , however , that his wife would be a " really good " commander in chief			0
" she is the ablest public servant i have ever worked with , even if she is my wife , " @entity2 said			1
" she 's smart , but she 's also uncannily able to move from a to b to @entity76 she gets things done and she is strong , she 's just good , she is just really good			0
she would be really good			0
but it 's a decision that only she can make , and i 'm not going to try to jump the gun and if she decides not to do it , i 'll be happy too			2
" @entity2 has long been careful to not weigh in too forcefully on what he hopes his wife will do in 2016			1
in an interview last week with @entity84 's @entity83 , he said @entity3 " will have to make the decision and i am not going to put my thumb on the scale either way			1
" last month , during an interview with @entity90 , he described himself as only a " bit player " when it comes to her presidential decision			2
in his interview with @entity1 , @entity2 said that now is his time to take a back seat to his wife 's ambitions			1
" when i left the @entity99 and @entity3 went into the @entity100 in @entity101 , i told her , i said , ' for 26 years you have made a lot of sacrifices for my public life			1
so i 'll give you the next 26 years and if i 'm still around we will fight about what we are going to do after that , ' " @entity2 said			0
" so we are just over a little half way through the second 26 years and whatever she wants is fine with me			0
" @entity3 spent much of the couple 's first decades together helping her husband 's political ambition			2
in 2000 , after eight years in the @entity99 and five terms as first lady of @entity116 , @entity3 became the first first lady to win elected office when she successfully ran for @entity101 's open @entity100 seat			2
she would later unsuccessfully run for president in 2008 , but serve as president @entity122 's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013			0
a cloud over the book tour it is what @entity2 did after the @entity99 , though , that has clouded much of the last month for @entity3 's book tour			1
in the first interview of the tour , @entity3 told @entity131 that her family was " dead broke " when they left the @entity99			0
although the family was in debt because of mounting legal fees , @entity2 failed to mention her family 's post-presidential windfall of book deals and speaking fees			2
a @entity1 analysis of the family 's financial records in early 2013 showed that @entity2 had earned $ 106 million from paid speeches since leaving the presidency behind			1
since leaving the @entity147 in 2013 , @entity3 , too , has cashed in on being a highly sought after speaker by charging upwards of $ 275,000 a speech			0
republicans seized on the storyline and tried to make the argument that @entity3 is out of touch with most @entity154			0
democrats close to @entity2 pushed back , but some admitted in private that the attacks hurt the former secretary of state			0
@entity2 told @entity16 that the storyline was a " fabricated " one that " shows you how desperately , sadly we are dependent on a new level of political gossip every week			1
" " most people would think that being 16 million dollars in debt would qualify as being dead broke , " @entity2 said , citing a number higher than the $ 2.28 million to $ 10.6 million figure that was cited on their federal financial records			0
defending his time on the paid speaking circuit , @entity2 said that after leaving the @entity99 and paying his debts , he " wanted to try and save enough money so that if anything happened to me , @entity3 and @entity172 could both be in public service if they wanted to be , and i do n't apologize for that			1
" " i do n't think it 's a bad thing to make money , " @entity2 said			2
" i think it 's bad if you live in a system that 's rigged against the poor and the middle class			0
that 's a very different thing and the purpose of politics is to create a system of shared opportunities and shared responsibilities			0

@entity3 " really does need some time to think through this , " he tells @entity1 's @entity16
he says he 's " fine " with her decision either way on a 2016 presidential run
*ex-president* on his wife : " she is the ablest public servant i have ever worked with "
@entity2 says he makes no apologies for the millions they 've made from speeches
