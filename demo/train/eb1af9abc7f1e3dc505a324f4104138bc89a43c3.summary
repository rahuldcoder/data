-- it was a triumph that came with joy from above			2
when @entity4 stood on the podium celebrating her second olympic gold medal of the @entity7 , she felt somebody watching over her and smiling			1
" the girl with the dancing horse " -- as she became known afterwards -- wowed the watching world as she claimed top honors in the team and individual dressage events			1
@entity15 was the order of the day -- and perhaps that was apt as it was her grandmother @entity15 's generous gift which allowed @entity4 to canter her way into the history books			1
" sometimes i do feel like she 's up there looking down on me and watching me , " the @entity23 equestrian told @entity0 's @entity25 series			2
" we were very close and she was very into horses too			2
she had a massive farm with lots of horses			2
i used to love going there and having so much fun			2
" it was only down to her inheritance that we could afford the horse , so i do think about her quite often			1
" making her way to compete in the world of dressage takes talent , hard work , dedication and money			1
while there was no doubt about @entity4 's ability , the lack of finance remained a huge hurdle in her battle to make it to the highest level			1
horses cost serious money , as do all the extras which come with owning an animal primed for the very top			1
" my family did n't have lots of money or anything , " the 27 - year - old said			1
" i literally did it through hard work and dedication			2
people out there who think you have to have loads of money to do this sport ... it just shows you			2
" i worked six days a week for very little money			2
but i did it because i wanted to and i loved it			2
for me it was a challenge			2
" with the inheritance left by her grandmother and the guidance of a determined mother , @entity4 moved from riding ponies to the world of dressage			1
it was the $ 27,000 purchase of her first horse fernandez which allowed @entity4 to lay the groundwork for an astonishing rise through the sport			1
at the age of 15 , she began her ascent , joining up with coach @entity97 and spending four years learning the ropes and working to earn a living			2
the mentor but it was her meeting with @entity103 , a @entity106 olympian and professional dressage competitor , which helped steer her towards that glorious day in @entity107			1
she made such an impression that she was offered a job as a groom at his yard in @entity112 , @entity113 , where she would go on to learn her trade			1
" i got asked to do a world - class training day , and @entity103 was one of the selectors for that , " she said			1
" he actually rode my horse @entity119 , which i was absolutely over the moon about because obviously someone like that riding my horse was like a dream			1
" i then got my mum to ask him if it was possible to have a lesson			2
so i met him at our national championships at @entity132 and he said he would give me a lesson			2
" i had four lessons ; he asked if i would do 10 days ' cover			2
i did it and i never went home			2
" @entity138 , the youngest @entity106 rider to ever compete at an @entity7 as a 25 - year - old in 1992 , saw something special in @entity141 and handed her the horse which would transform her life forever			1
love at first sight @entity146 , or " blueberry " as he is known within the stables , turned out to be a " dream horse			1
" too young to compete at a @entity153 event , the top level of competition , @entity138 wanted @entity146 to learn the trade under his young apprentice			1
" i just fell in love with @entity146 when i saw him , " @entity4 said			1
" he was just a powerhouse at four years old			2
he had paces then that he could n't control and he had a fabulous temperament			2
" he was my dream horse			1
and then i managed to take him out and compete him at all the young horse classes			1
" in their seven years together , the pair have become near inseparable , with @entity164 describing him as " my best friend and my partner			2
" from their first @entity153 together in 2011 , a journey which took five years in the making , the duo have not looked back			0
" he always wants to please you , " she said			0
" he goes into that arena to do his best			0
he never lets you down			0
he 's with you all the way			0
" to find a horse that can cope with all the atmosphere as well is very difficult			1
he just does it all			0
" as a rider he gives you so much confidence			1
you go in there and you know you can do it because you know he 's behind you			0
" i think it was the connection we had , the fact we 'd learned everything together			0
if i got it wrong , or if he made a mistake , between the two of us we both learned how to get it right			0
" that is what was so good			0
he was forgiving my mistakes and i was forgiving him			0
" international success the relationship has blossomed beautifully , and they were part of the @entity106 team which won gold at the @entity202 at @entity203			1
@entity4 and @entity146 then won the @entity205 @entity204 @entity153 at @entity206 in 2011 , and set a new world points record at the @entity210 @entity153 special event the following year			1
it was the prelude to the most exciting and most daunting challenge of @entity4 's career -- the @entity7			1
competing in both the team and individual event in front of a home crowd might have left lesser riders with stage fright -- but not @entity4			1
" i see the arena , the competition arena , as an arena at home , " she said			0
" i do the same thing wherever i am , whether it 's at home or at a competition			0
" i never think of who 's in the competition			0
i never let myself get in that frame of mind , worrying about who i 'm against			0
" i keep myself away , i keep myself very focused			0
i keep myself in that zone of what i have to do and deliver			0
i 'm really lucky that i can control my nerves ; it does n't seem to get to me			0
" london calling just 18 months after making her @entity153 debut , @entity4 headed out onto @entity239 as part of the @entity106 team seeking to win its first ever medal in dressage since 1912			1
the discipline was originally used to train horses during the renaissance period			0
the " piaffe " is a signature move where the horse jogs on the spot , while there are also the " flying changes " -- where it skips on alternate legs			1
following two controlled rounds , where competitors are marked out of 10 and awarded a percentage score , they then go on to perform a freestyle routine			0
riding alongside her mentor @entity138 and @entity263 -- granddaughter of a @entity265 billionaire -- it was a dream come true			0
with 23,000 people packed inside the arena and the world watching on , @entity4 delivered in style , becoming the new @entity210 score record - holder with 83.286 %			1
" we had high expectations to deliver that gold medal , " she revealed			1
" everybody expected us to win it , we had such a strong team			1
but you know at the end of the day they are horses			0
" you never know what can happen			0
and i think it probably put pressure on us a little bit more that everybody expected that			0
" but i 'm the sort of person , i do n't think of things like that			0
i just do my best			0
and that 's what i did			0
" the victory of the @entity106 team reverberated around the world as it finally broke the @entity265 stranglehold on the sport			1
magic moment but for @entity4 there was still work to do			1
" going into the individual , i honestly was going to be absolutely delighted with any medal , " she said			1
" i was n't even thinking of getting the gold			1
i was thinking any medal would be amazing			0
" and you know , i went in there , and @entity308 had just come out with a huge score of 88 %			0
" they announced that just before i was going in			0
so i heard that as i was going down			0
" the @entity313 rider 's score had left @entity4 requiring an @entity210 record to claim top spot , but that did n't faze the home favorite , who was the final competitor to perform			1
" i went in there and i thought , ' do you know what , i can do this , i know i can do this , ' " she said			0
" and i went in there and i ca n't even tell you how it felt			0
" sitting on her beloved @entity146 , @entity4 had the horse dancing majestically to the sounds of " @entity330 , " " @entity331 " and the chimes of @entity107 's iconic @entity333			1
the beautifully artistic routine appeared to compensate for any technical deficiencies as she wowed the judges			0
' a dream come true ' " the moment i finished my test it was like uproar , " she recalled			0
" it was like everybody screaming , shouting and standing			0
" and i did n't know i 'd won			2
i looked over and there was this lady hanging over the stadium , and she said , ' you 've done it ! you 've done it ! ' " and i 'm looking , and then i heard the crowd just go crazy			0
and then i realized i 'd actually got the individual gold			1
and for me that was just unbelievable			0
" to think in 18 months what i had achieved and come away with			0
just to be at the @entity7 in your home ground anyway was a huge achievement for me			1
" but then to come away with two gold medals was a dream come true			1
" @entity4 received an overall mark of 90.089 in the individual event , which was lifted by a mammoth 93.429 for artistic merit			1
" i still find it really hard to let it all sink in what i 've achieved , because everything happened so quickly , " she said			0
" from 2011 to 2012 i did n't stop			0
then you stop and you sit down and you look back at what you 've done and what you 've achieved			0
" it certainly would have made her grandmother proud .			2
