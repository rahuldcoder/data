-- @entity1 has always been a continent of contrasts			2
and the latest findings from an amazing team of international researchers show that when it comes to providing our children with the best chances in life , @entity1 once more presents a very mixed picture			2
in a new report , never - before - available comparative data on laws and public policies in 191 countries , covering poverty , discrimination , education , health , child labor , child marriage and parental care , reveals how millions of children across the world face conditions that limit their opportunities to thrive and reach their full potential because of governments failure to act			1
this new research aims to broaden global attention from solely survival to children 's full and healthy development			1
it comes at a critical time as the global community is looking to set new goals and agree on what all the world 's nations will strive for in the so - called " post- 2015 " agenda following more than a decade of efforts focused around the @entity43 ( @entity43 )			0
children 's opportunities are not just shaped by parents and families , but also by national action in the form of laws and public policies			1
this may involve removing tuition fees , ensuring inclusive education for children with disabilities , enforcing minimum age requirements for labor , age restrictions for marriage so girls might have a better chance to stay in education , or assisting parents to be able to earn enough to support their children and have the time off from work they need to care for their children 's health and education			1

primary education is tuition free across the majority of the region ( in 36 of the 41 countries with available figures ) and 13 countries have removed charges for secondary education			2
in addition , virtually all @entity1 countries ( 45 of the 46 countries with data ) guarantee paid maternity leave ( although of these 23 provide less than the 14 - week minimum established by the @entity92 ) , and 41 of 45 countries have recognized the need to provide income support during periods of unemployment ( although this largely does not cover the informal economy )			0
and progress in improving children 's chances does not necessarily rely on the ability to open large purses			2
some low and middle - income countries have made impressive advances for children			0
@entity109 , for example , makes education compulsory for 12 years , longer than all other countries in the region , including those with a higher gdp , and it has a higher minimum age for full - time work than its neighbors			0
elimination of schools fees in @entity120 in the 1990s has led to a jump in primary school enrollment from under 50 % in 1991 to 99 % in 1999			1

progress is clearly possible when there is political will			0
but there remains substantial room for policy advances to transform the lives of older children , youth and the poorest			0
at secondary level , educational opportunities in much of the region are deeply limited -- and limiting			1
a greater proportion of countries in @entity1 than in other regions -- some 61 % -- begin charging tuition fees before the end of secondary school			1
when we look beyond the issue of accessibility to the quality of education our children receive -- after all it should be fit for purpose -- the region has among the lowest education requirements for teachers , with 50 % of countries requiring lower secondary school teachers to have completed no higher than a secondary education ( so teachers have barely more education that their students )			1
plus , while policies in the formal economy are relatively strong in terms of supporting families , those in the informal economy remain unprotected			0
despite the fact that many countries have set a minimum wage , in 6 countries this wage is just $ 2 per day or less -- and in 20 others is between $ 2 an $ 4 , leaving even a family of one adult and one dependent under the $ 2 poverty line			0
how can we expect children to thrive given this reality ? what this kind of comparative data and analysis allows us to do is see more clearly where progress is and is n't occurring			0
it is only when we begin to call out country 's names -- the leaders and the laggards -- that we 'll see all children count on having a childhood where they can go to school and not labor full - time , a childhood free of marriages that require them to parent before they have grown up themselves , getting the education they need to find work that will lift them out of poverty , and not facing discrimination based on their gender or ethnicity			2
@entity1 should be a region that has high ambitions for its children and demand that the post- 2015 development agenda is one that thinks big for our children and their chances			2
read the report and stay up to date on @entity221 # kidschances			0
