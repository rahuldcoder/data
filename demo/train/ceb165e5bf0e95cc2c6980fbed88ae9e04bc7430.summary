-- " @entity1 " was that rarity : a best - selling book that was also well reviewed , earning spots on both the @entity6 best - seller list and critics ' best - of lists			1
will the movie starring @entity10 and @entity11 which opens friday measure up ? ' @entity14 ' movies ? no such thing , says @entity16 it 's hard to say			1
early reviews have been positive , but some critics have reservations			0
the @entity22 's @entity21 highlighted the differing needs of books and movies as the reason for his mixed review			1
while complaining about one of the film 's subplots , he observed , " it comes straight from the novel , and you can picture the outcry if ( director @entity36 ) @entity35 had chopped or changed it , but so what ? a director 's task is not to suck up to readers , or to flatter his source , but to imagine it afresh , as film , while seizing on those aspects that matter to him most			0
" it 's a fine line			0
let an adaptation leave out a character or condense a plot and book fans will scream in protest			2
but include every nuance , every tangent , and moviegoers will yawn with fatigue			0
studios will always rely on books -- they 're an easy source for new stories			2
and many of those adaptations will end up as hit movies			1
but that does n't mean they 're always done well			0
check the gallery for some considerations of whether the book or movie did the job better .			2
