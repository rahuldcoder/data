@entity5 as @entity1 lay dying on his bed in a @entity4 hospital in november 2006 , he was in no doubt as to who was to blame for his imminent death			1
the 43 - year - old former @entity11 agent turned @entity13 critic pointed his finger directly at @entity15 , then as now , @entity11 's strongman president			1
" you may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price , " @entity1 said in the statement from his deathbed			2
" you may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate , mr. @entity15 , in your ears for the rest of your life			2
" read more : did @entity11 put polonium in spy 's tea ? it 's an allegation the @entity13 has never really managed to shake off			1
officials have always dismissed the charge as " nonsense , " but suspicions linger			0
the @entity13 's case is n't much helped by the compelling evidence against it			0
the poison used to kill @entity1 is a rare radioactive isotope , polonium - 210			1
it occurs naturally , but scientists say the high concentrations found in the @entity1 case indicate production at a nuclear reactor , or perhaps a particle accelerator			2
the kinds of facilities , in other words , controlled by a state			0
@entity11 is n't the only country capable of producing polonium - 210			2
but the radioactive trail left by the substance -- literally a trail of detectable radioactive material -- was traced across @entity4 , while three @entity60 aircraft that had flown a number of routes , including @entity4 to @entity5 , were reported to be contaminated with small traces of an unnamed radioactive substance			1
the two prime suspects in the poisoning , @entity65 and @entity66 , are @entity11 nationals			1
both are former agents of the @entity11 security services			2
but both deny involvement and the @entity11 government refuses to extradite either to @entity74 to face trial			0
he was a former agent of the @entity77 , the @entity77 , the @entity79 successor of the feared @entity80			1
his last job at the agency was heading up its anti-corruption department			0
it was in the chaos of the 1990s , in the aftermath of the collapse of the @entity88 that may well have brought him into conflict with ruthless colleagues			0
after leaving the @entity77 , he blamed the service for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in @entity11 in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to @entity11 's invasion of @entity96 later that year			1
@entity1 's wife also claimed her husband was in the pay of the @entity74 security services after moving to the @entity74 in 2000			2
all or any of the above may have been sufficient reason to kill a man seen by his former @entity77 colleagues as a traitor			0
there are some questions that even the public inquiry now underway in @entity74 may never be able to answer			1
why , for instance was polonium - 210 chosen to kill @entity1 ? it would have been a costly and complicated task to produce the quantity used in the murder			0
a bullet would have been much cheaper			0
perhaps the killers hoped it would not have been detected by @entity74 investigators			0
or perhaps they wanted to send a message , pointing the police towards an executioner they knew would never be held to account ? but the biggest question of all is whether the killing was ordered by the state , or was the work of rogue elements within it			0
perhaps only president @entity15 , himself a former @entity80 agent , has the answer to that .			1

@entity1 died in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive material
a public inquiry into the former @entity80 agent 's poisoning death opens in @entity4
@entity11 president @entity15 was accused by the *ex-spy* of being behind it
