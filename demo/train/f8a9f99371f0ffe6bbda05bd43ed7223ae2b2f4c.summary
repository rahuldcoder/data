@entity0 , @entity1 -- a left - leaning website that union supporters used to rally protesters in @entity1 was partially blocked as demonstrators gathered in the state @entity7 over a controversial budget bill			1
the website , defendwisconsin.org , could not be accessed on monday and into tuesday morning in the @entity7 building , where crowds assembled over proposed legislation that would increase the costs of benefits to public employees and curb their collective - bargaining rights			1
@entity19 press secretary @entity18 blamed gov. @entity20 and @entity22 lawmakers -- who returned to work tuesday -- for causing the outage			1
" in a direct assault on the @entity26 , @entity20 's administration is blocking access in the @entity1 @entity7 to opposition websites , " @entity18 said			1
the governor 's spokesman , @entity29 , responded tuesday , calling the accusation " a lie			1
" " @entity33 blocks all new websites shortly after they are created , until they go through a software approval program that unblocks them , " @entity29 said			0
" within 30 minutes of being notified this website was blocked , @entity37 circumvented the software and immediately made the website accessible			1
" he said , " the @entity19 should spend less time lying about gov. @entity20 and more time trying to get their @entity45 state senators back to @entity1 , " referring to @entity19 efforts to prevent a quorum in the @entity48			1
the @entity7 internet service , which restricts access to certain websites considered inappropriate for lawmakers , revealed a " blocked page " when users tried to access the site using the building 's wireless system			1
users were able to access the site elsewhere			0
the outage comes on the heels of a speech by @entity20 , who defended the budget proposal and criticized unions for squandering state coffers and impeding fiscal reform			2
" we 're broke , " he told reporters monday			2
" you really ca n't negotiate when you do n't have money to negotiate with			0
" unions have argued that collective bargaining -- a process of negotiations meant to regulate working conditions -- has helped protect wages and health care , enforce workplace safety and serve as a means to arbitrate employee grievances			0
the budget - repair bill , proposed by @entity20 to address a $ 137 million shortfall through june 30 , would increase contributions of state workers to their pensions and health insurance benefits			2
it requires collective - bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification			0
it also eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks			0
@entity20 warned that not passing the proposed bill would result in at least 1,500 government employees being laid off in the short term and could result in the layoffs of upward of 6,000 workers in the following budget cycle			0
last week , 14 @entity19 state senators essentially boycotted the @entity104 and went to @entity105 to prevent a quorum from passing the bill			2
the measure 's opponents said they wo n't allow a vote unless @entity20 negotiates on the plan to eliminate collective - bargaining rights for everything but wages			0
@entity2 's @entity114 contributed to this report .			0
