@entity0 -- in 2002 , a male killer whale , or orca , who had been on public display in concrete tanks for 19 years , swam off on his own into the @entity6			1
@entity7 , the star of the movie " @entity9 , " had been rescued from a tiny tank , sent to recover his health in a larger tank , and then finally returned to his native waters of @entity14			1
he spent two years adjusting to life in the habitat of his infancy , gaining more independence as the days and months went by , until he was finally allowed out of his pen without a tether , to swim freely in the ocean for the first time since 1979			2
after interacting with the wild orcas now and again and spending hours exploring the coast of the @entity26 , @entity7 decided to head off toward the horizon with a pod of wild whales			1
for his entire five - week journey across hundreds of miles of open sea , researchers tracked @entity7 with a satellite tag			1
he went more or less in a straight line , ending up in @entity35			0
he had lost little or no weight , suggesting he had been feeding himself , at least a bit			0
somewhere along the way @entity7 had parted ways with the wild whales and had been alone for more time than he apparently liked ; he arrived in @entity35 's @entity42 fjord eager for company			1
he found companionship in the form of boats and even intrepid @entity35 children who got into the frigid north @entity6 waters to welcome him			1
after a bit too much attention , @entity7 's caretakers from the @entity50 , which my organization managed at that time , arrived to once again take up their duties			1
@entity7 had shown he could adjust again to his natural habitat , but he was n't ready to be independent			1
he wanted human companionship and he had it , coming and going as he pleased but always returning to the project team , who took up residence in a house in the fjord			0
he died more than a year later , probably from pneumonia			0
@entity65 , the longtime captive orca who drowned veteran @entity69 trainer @entity68 on february 24 , is at a crossroads			1
he has been involved in three fatal interactions now			0
he is the largest orca in captivity and is often kept in a small side pool that is barely large enough for him to turn around			0
he is 30 or 31 years old , as old as any captive male orca before him has ever lived			0
most captive male orcas die in their teens or early 20s at best , with only a handful reaching their late 20s and only three making it past 30 , although this is only middle - aged for a wild male			0
he has fathered more than a dozen calves , but @entity69 has perfected artificial insemination , so his physical presence is n't even needed for breeding			1
so what should @entity69 do with him after this latest incident ? how can it ensure his well - being and the safety of its employees ? @entity69 should try thinking outside the swimming pool when it considers its options for @entity65 's future			1
@entity65 needs something he is n't getting in a concrete enclosure			1
the idea of keeping captive such a large , complex , intelligent predator for our entertainment may no longer be acceptable in the 21st century			0
trainer safety with @entity65 is a serious concern			2
if he stays in a @entity69 tank , putting distance between him and his trainers will only further isolate him , which is completely unnatural and stressful for a social species like orcas			1
keeping him out of the shows will only increase his inactivity and boredom			0
however , @entity7 actually had only limited physical contact with his trainers , in an effort to increase his independence , but he was never bored or inactive -- he had so much to hold his interest in his natural environment			2
if @entity65 were moved to a sea pen ( ideally in @entity14 , where he too was captured , in 1983 ) , he would be stimulated enough even without direct contact with his caretakers			2
this would maximize both his welfare and his caretakers ' safety			0
it would be stressful to move him			2
a transport of an adult orca is no small matter and significant risk would be involved			0
the whale has to be placed in a specially designed sling , hoisted into a box half - filled with water , and trucked to a plane like a 747 or a troop transport that requires an experienced pilot to avoid unbalancing the load			0
but significant risk is involved in leaving him where he is , as he is -- leaving him in the same circumstances that have , over his 27 years in a box , led to the deaths of three people			2
it 's time to change the playbook			0
it 's time to try something new			0
it 's time to follow @entity7 's fin strokes and try again to give a captive orca a better life , a more natural life , a more respectful life			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			2

@entity7 , the star of " @entity9 , " was released into the @entity6 after 19 years of captivity
@entity161 says it 's *difficult* and stressful to move a whale into the wild
but she says it 's the right *solution* for @entity65 , the whale involved in a fatality at @entity69
@entity65 needs something he is n't getting in a concrete enclosure , @entity156 says
