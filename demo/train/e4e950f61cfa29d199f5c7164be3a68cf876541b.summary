-- in six hours , a person might walk 18 or so miles			0
by car , it could be 350 - plus miles			0
a commercial airplane might get as far as 3,400 miles			0
a spaceship ? in that much time , you could get from @entity8 to the @entity9			2
that 's what happened with a @entity13 spacecraft , which launched from @entity14 at 4:43 p.m. et thursday , or 2:43 a.m. friday local time , with three soon - to - be space station crew members on board			1
@entity19 mission control declared " contact and capture confirmed " at 10:28 p.m. et -- four minutes earlier than planned -- indicating the spacecraft had successfully docked			1
this six - hour jaunt was exponentially faster than the normal two - day adventure that astronauts and cosmonauts typically take to get to the iss. that 's because , while the live - in orbiter is a mere 250 miles from @entity8 , it 's always moving -- so it 's not a simple matter of going from @entity28 to point @entity29 that 's why it has traditionally taken so long to get there , with the spacecraft going round the @entity8 every 90 or so minutes , which works out to about 16 total before docking			1
more space news on @entity36 but this go around , the @entity37 only orbited four times before hooking up with the space station			1
" we 're trying to cut that amount of time that they had to be in those close quarters , " @entity19 spokesman @entity41 said , noting the spacecraft has a basic bathroom but little living space			2
" ... they may be sharper now , if they 'd have to take over the docking			0
" @entity55 ' @entity54 ' capsule returns from @entity9 trip the @entity19 spokesman explained that equipment and computer software upgrades , among other factors , helped to make thursday 's historically fast flight possible			0
and it 's possible space officials might decide that the longer , old - fashioned way -- allowing the crew to get its space legs over two days , however cramped they might be -- is preferable , depending on how this mission goes , @entity41 said			1
this pioneering , fast - track crew was made up @entity70 and @entity71 from @entity73 's space agency , as well as @entity19 astronaut @entity74			2
with their voyage complete -- and once the space station 's hatches open for them , scheduled for soon after midnight -- they 'll have plenty of time to get comfy : they are scheduled to remain on the orbiter for about six months before heading home			1

new : the spacecraft docks at 10:28 p.m. et after flight of less than six hours
up until now , it would take two days for crews to go from @entity8 to the space station
the spacecraft orbited @entity8 four times before docking , compared to the usual 16 orbits
its three - member crew will remain on the space station through *september*
