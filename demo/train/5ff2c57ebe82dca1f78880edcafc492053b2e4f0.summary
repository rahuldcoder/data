-- fifty years ago this month , the assassination of president @entity2 numbed the world			2
but as the front pages of history were being printed , there was one scoop slipping by virtually unnoticed : the western hemisphere was witnessing a youthquake			2
only weeks earlier , " @entity16 " was born , when thousands of screaming girls at @entity11 greeted a young boy - band home from a short tour of @entity15			2
passing through the airport was stalwart @entity19 tv host @entity18 who , on seeing the hysterical adulation offered up to four mop - topped boys , decided to have them on his show			2
whether anyone was aware of it at the time , the youth revolution was underway			1
it had been gathering momentum all through 1963 -- pied pipers with guitars inspired young people to seize the day , to reject the lives led by their parents , and create their own music , fashion and culture			1
times they were a-changing the @entity38 went from relative obscurity at the start of 1963 to performing in front of 73 million @entity19 -- nearly a third of the population -- on the @entity44 at the beginning of 1964			1
pop groups -- most still fresh from school -- were suddenly being invited to the likes of @entity49 and the @entity50			1
president @entity51 had one band , the @entity52 , frogmarched up the steps of @entity54 -- so he could get their autographs			2
a generation that had been tolerated became a generation to be wooed			2
their stage had been built ; 1963 was the opening night -- and so radical was their new path , such a break from the past , that they 'd no sense of what was waiting for them			1
" we would sit in a club , me , the @entity73 , the @entity38 , the models -- and we 'd talk about how it would only last a couple of years and then we 'd have to get jobs like our parents , " recalls @entity68 , the celebrated @entity69 photographer who chronicled the sweeping changes in @entity11 in 1963			1
" @entity80 was going to be a hairdresser , @entity79 thought he 'd have to work in a bank			2
the models just thought they 'd let their hair down before they found a husband or got a proper job as a secretary			2
" but suddenly , in that one year we realized , the lives we were living were n't just a rite of passage			1
we could be anything we wanted to be			0
nobody was going to stop us			0
none of us were trained			0
@entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity2 , none of them could read a note of music			0
i picked up a camera			0
i had no idea what i was doing			0
but nobody told us we could n't			0
that , says @entity68 , is what was truly special about 1963			1
" we could be whatever we wanted to be , whatever we wanted to say we were			0
" a hard day 's night speaking to me in his last interview weeks before his death last year , legendary hairdresser @entity109 put the sense of youthful irreverence and creativity that would define an era into context			1
" after the war , @entity69 was broke , we were broke , [ so this meant ] the kids were brought up in an extraordinary mood of rebuilding and rebelliousness , " he said			0
@entity109 , a working - class boy from @entity11 's @entity123 , had focused his ambition to be a hairdresser and moved upmarket into @entity11 's mega-posh @entity127			1
while his salon had served the aristocracy and the wives of rich and powerful men , @entity109 -- in the spirit of the age -- resisted establishment conventions and created a stark , geometric statement of youthful independence : the wedge bob cut			1
" i walked past his salon one day and saw this photograph of a haircut			0
it was the five point bob , " says @entity141 -- who would herself service the burgeoning cult of youth by severing 12 inches off a hem , thereby inventing the minidress			1
" i wanted to look like that model			0
everyone i knew wanted to look like that model			0
" in a recording studio in @entity152 , @entity73 guitarist @entity150 says that the youth of 1963 changed the world " with guitars , patterns , scissors , paint brushes , cameras , and mold - breaking , often naÃ ¯ ve ideas			1
time is on my side " for years we 'd been told , ' you 'll go into the army , that 'll sort you out '			0
then suddenly we did n't have to go into the army , " @entity168 says			0
the post-war draft had ended in @entity69 and was being scaled down in the @entity19			0
young people had grown up expecting to do three years of military service and then , out of nowhere , " we had those years back , " says @entity168			0
all that newly discovered free time led to a burst of expression that was , at times , shocking			0
that year , a young @entity178 moved into a fire - house on @entity181 's @entity180 to stretch the boundaries of the art world , and a young @entity184 invented his own palette			1
a clothing company called @entity187 's recognized a trend and launched its pre-shrunk jeans ; @entity190 was fired by @entity191 and began his @entity193 experiment ; the @entity195 and @entity196 folk festivals created a new template for the mass celebration of youth			1
and it was n't just the prosperity and the freedom to explore new music and wear new fashions to dance and parade in : the contraceptive pill became widely available to young women , liberating them from fear of unwanted and adolescence - curtailing pregnancy			0
in that one year , nobodies made names for themselves that would span half a century , and whose contribution to art and culture will continue to span centuries to come			1
it 's thanks to @entity79 , @entity220 and the @entity38 ; to @entity222 , @entity109 ; and to the countless other fashion mavens , musicians and artists who emerged that year that 18 - year - olds today command the attention of politicians and @entity229			1
before 1963 , youth was largely acquiescent and acquisitive			1
after 1963 , they were impossible to ignore			2

1963 was the most *important* year for art and culture , argues author @entity239
amid political *turmoil* was the birth of a ' global *demographic* power shift '
likes of @entity38 , @entity73 , @entity178 and @entity109 signaled first rise of youth
