-- " i am leaving , " i murmured to my husband			2
" you can not leave , " he hissed back			2
" it is 3 a.m. these are our friends			1
" " do n't worry			2
i 'll just find a hotel and be back here in time for breakfast			1
they wo n't even know i left			2
" " you can not do this again ! people think we 're mad			1
you can not leave someone 's house just because a doorknob is sticky			2
" oh , but it was n't just the doorknob			2
it was everything , at least in my mind			2
this was about 10 years ago , and my husband and i had been invited as weekend guests to the home of dear friends with a one - year - old son			1
this was before i had my own kids , before i realized that the essential condition of childhood is stickiness and that i would spend the first five years of their lives fearfully clutching wet wipes			1
@entity1 : how to be a good friend right then i knew only one thing : a doorknob was whispering to me , all @entity41 - like : get			2
i have never been a good houseguest			2
and -- despite what this episode might imply -- it 's not because i 'm impressively fastidious			2
i am a complete slob in my own home , albeit one with dry , noncling surfaces			2
but after years of trying very hard to enjoy myself when other people invite me over for the weekend , i 've basically given up			1
i like to think i 'm the best kind of guest : one who does n't actually stay with you			1
oddly , people do n't always see it my way			1
particularly the house - proud , those who love their 1,000 - count sheets and cunning window treatments and @entity61 stoves with the special tiny flame for heating chocolate or whatever the hell it does -- those people do n't like me			1
they do n't like me a lot			0
i have lost friends over my inability to just get with the program and bask in their hostessy generosity			1
here 's the thing : my husband -- a @entity73 whose love of staying at other people 's homes could rival that of @entity78 , from @entity80 novels -- thinks i am rude			1
what i suffer from is an overabundance of politeness , and a terror of all the ways i can fail to live up to my own standards			1
i am cursed with the knowledge of my impolitic nature , and if i have to spend more than a couple of hours being courteous , i become convinced i will get too cavalier and say whatever stupid thing is on my mind			1
and there are many stupid things on my mind			1
@entity1 : small , helpful gestures with big impact so i have to be eternally vigilant			0
i 'm like a werewolf who , when espying a full moon , knows that the only way the people he loves will live to see tomorrow is if he locks himself in the closet and swallows the key			1
when i confessed this problem of mine to a friend , she immediately started listing all the wonderful times she 's had in other people 's houses : the hammocks she 's lain in , the @entity113 's she 's sipped in tall , icy glasses while allowing herself to feel loved and nurtured			1
allow me to catalog @entity114 can go wrong when you stay with people			1
people hide the items you need most			1
where 's the coffee ? no , not that decaffeinated imposter ; the real coffee			0
no wonder everyone in this house is still asleep at 6:30 a.m. @entity127 , i will just go out and buy coffee at the corner store			0
oh wait , there 's no store at the corner -- that 's a pond			0
it 's 6:30 a.m. and all i want to do at this point is run home			0
i will be repeating the same interior monologue at midnight , only this time it will be about gin cocktails			1
i mean , what kind of people do n't keep their limes in plain sight ? @entity1 : 5 ways to win people over people in other houses eat things that are not , in fact , edible			1
i think the idea is that when you 're having guests , the experience must involve " special food , " and " special food " nine times out of 10 is completely horrifying			0
seriously , if octopus really tasted that good , would n't there be @entity157 dotting @entity158 ? of course , i also despise people who make a big to - do about their precious little eating habits			1
instead , now and then , i bring little treats with me that i like and , naturally , intend to share			0
occasionally this goes over well			0
" how thoughtful ! " the host exclaims			0
more often , though , she shoots me an icy stare : oh , my cooking is n't good enough for you ? people 's houses are quiet			1
i live in @entity171 , and as a result i 'm a little weird about silence			0
out in the hinterlands , the no - noise freaks me out			0
where are the car horns ? the garbage trucks backing up ? why is nobody screaming , " i will kill you ! " in the middle of the night ? it 's unsettling			0
in this frame of mind , every owl hoot sounds like the arrival of the @entity187			0
truly , i am 10 pounds fatter in everyone else 's home			0
is it the mirrors ? or maybe it 's the fact that other people have mirrors , which i do not			1
@entity1 : 5 ways to stay cool under pressure people you never want to visualize without shoes will inevitably appear before you , naked			1
ok , maybe not naked			0
and to me that generally means something on either the top or the bottom is missing			0
people do n't appreciate poorly worded compliments			2
personally , i never seem to strike the right chord			0
i think the problem is that i 'm a @entity210 : i do n't know the difference between @entity212 and @entity213			0
once , i visited a particularly grand family and started gushing over the adorable handiwork of their fourth grader , who had molded all these tiny circus animals and placed them in a whimsical diorama on the coffee table			2
" that 's a @entity223 , " the father replied coolly			0
need i say more ? people 's houses seem to invite trouble			2
i mean , i 'm not @entity229 ; it 's not as if when i show up at someone 's house homicidal shenanigans follow			0
but i have never been to someone 's home without bringing some sort of bad karma with me			0
@entity1 : 13 productive things to do while watching tv how did i arrive at the home of a friend whose three - year - old had , just at that moment , contracted chicken pox , ensuring that i -- one of the three adults in the entire universe who had not suffered from the disease as a child -- would end up in the emergency room 10 days later ? why did i knock on the door of a friend 's house the day it was swarmed by ladybugs -- thus guaranteeing that i , an insectophobe , would spend the night listening to the gentle plink of tiny hard - shelled creatures kamikaze - ing themselves onto my bedclothes ? please let me be clear : in theory , i want to visit you			1
( and i hope you visit me , because my fear and loathing of being a houseguest does not , oddly enough , apply to having houseguests			0
) after all , i like you so much			0
i want to coo at your kids , cuddle with your pets , inventory the drugs in your medicine cabinet , and talk into the wee hours			0
and then i want to go to a hotel , empty the minibar , and write you a thank - you note before hanging my breakfast order on the spotless doorknob so the pot of hot , fully caffeinated coffee will be delivered at exactly 6:30 a.m. @entity278 is the author of @entity279 ( $ 13 , @entity280 )			1
she has written for numerous publications , including the @entity282 , @entity283 , and @entity284			0
