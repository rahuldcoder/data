when it comes to romance , texting is often seen as a bare - minimum form of communication			1
it 's fine for firming up wednesday night dinner plans , but for expressing heartfelt sentiments ? not so much			1
that was made pretty clear last week when reality tv star @entity9 had to defend her fianc√© , @entity11 quarterback @entity10 , from those who poked fun at her story of their second engagement			0
" i was in the airport , leaving @entity19 , " @entity9 , 26 , tells @entity17 news in an upcoming reality special about her nuptials			0
" we had just spent however many days together and we were texting and somehow it came up , like , ' oh , shall we get married ? ' we 're like , ' yeah , ok			1
' " the couple were first engaged in 2011 but split up briefly before reconciling that same year			0
even so , @entity10 faced criticism over what many saw as a too casual digital proposal			1
@entity9 later pleaded on @entity30 for people to " stop bashing @entity10 " because he had proposed earlier in @entity32 " and it was very romantic			2
" in the digital age , technology is n't killing courtship			1
but for many young couples , it 's redefining what romance looks like			1
these days we often text instead of speak , use @entity42 instead of having face - to - face discussions and zip through online dating profiles with the same speed it takes to order a pizza			0
convenient , sure , but " @entity48 " it 's not			2
these habits have many wondering if technology is getting in the way of real romance			1
but let 's be honest : how many of us have gotten into a heated , or just plain hot , text exchange with a love interest ? chances are , many of the messages saved in your phone are more intimate than your standard pillow talk			2
from @entity64 to @entity65 since the early days of the @entity66 , we 've used tech as a tool to broaden our prospects for meeting others and finding romance			2
we 've come a long way since those @entity64 chat rooms , and even traditional dating sites are giving way to smartphone apps that can do the matchmaking for us			0
using your phone 's gps feature , mobile social apps such as @entity79 , @entity80 , are you interested ? and @entity85 help you zero in on potential dates , or hook - ups , right around the corner			2
the upside of online dating : always a funny story to tell for the daring , @entity65 recently launched a @entity94 - style app called @entity95 , which sets users up on short notice with someone they know almost nothing about			0
it 's not exactly the romanticized version of a fateful meeting , wherein you find your soul mate at spin class or in line for a movie matinee			2
the lost art of offline dating " those really romantic scenarios are kind of diluted nowadays , " said @entity110 , co-founder of @entity110 , a new - media production company based in @entity111 that creates short films and video blogs			1
@entity110 and his colleagues created a video series called " @entity117 , " which makes light of the ways technology could easily solve dilemmas that have been held up as " romantic " obstacles			1
the idea came from watching " rom - coms where you 're sitting there thinking , ' things could 've been totally solved if he took out his cell phone , or just messaged her on @entity126 , ' " says @entity110 , 28			1
" i understand that movies are meant to escape reality , but even just for fun , you could say , wait , why is n't he just calling her instead of showing up outside of her door and surprising her ? " a lot of the mystery we 've typically associated with romance is " not as strong as it used to be , " @entity110 said			1
the power of @entity126 some young single people today would rather have information than mystery			1
when @entity147 , a 29 - year - old it professional , was skeptical of a potential date he 'd met online , he did what anyone who 's seen an episode of " catfish " ( or just has plain common sense ) would do : he turned to @entity126			1
" i wanted to know something about her , i ca n't say that i 'm not nosy , " said @entity147 , who lives in @entity155 , @entity156			2
" i did n't feel comfortable with the information she was telling me			2
i would text her , possibly when i get off work , i would give her a call and she would n't answer , [ but ] she would text me in the morning and say ' hey , how was your day yesterday ? ' it made me kind of suspicious			2
so in that particular situation , i googled her			0
" on her @entity126 page , @entity167 could see " friends of friends , " which allows one to see so much more information , he said			1
" if you read the comments , you can find out details about that picture , which tells you details about that person			0
" there can be drawbacks to this @entity126 sleuthing , said dr. @entity181 , an associate professor of communication at @entity183 in @entity167 , @entity184			1
brushing up on someone 's background pre-date means you could skip over some of those foundational moments of discovery in person , she said			2
but for @entity192 of @entity193 , @entity194 , digital tools enhanced her courtship with @entity196 , the man who would become her husband			1
she came across @entity196 's profile on dating site @entity85 and warmed to his photo , which showed him wearing a @entity201 t - shirt under a black blazer			2
she messaged him to strike up a conversation			0
he is not a big phone person and only wanted to talk over @entity64 instant messenger			0
@entity196 , 26 , went along with it after looking him up on @entity126 and liking what she found			1
" i facebooked him , and it actually did help			0
... if i were to discover his favorite color online , i do n't think i would 've had any different reaction than i would 've had in person , " she said			2
after chatting online for two weeks , @entity196 drove down from @entity217 to meet @entity196 while she was a student at @entity219			0
soon they were taking turns driving to see each other , and tied the knot three years later			0
romance , on @entity225 although meeting in person will always be essential , the concept of romance has evolved to the point where weeks of instant messaging or e-mailing can plant seeds of a relationship			1
that 's been the case for 20 - year - old @entity236 , a @entity237 student who relies on @entity225 and e-mail to nurture her long - distance relationship with her boyfriend , @entity240 , while he 's working in @entity242			1
from the beginning , their courtship was carried out through digital means			1
@entity236 's boyfriend , a @entity237 alum , asked for her e-mail address instead of her number at first			0
while some might have taken that as a hint of disinterest , @entity236 recognized that the frequent , friendly e-mails were his way of showing he liked her			0
eventually , he asked for her number , and they went on their first date about a month later			0
" a lot of our relationship has been e-mailing and texting and @entity126 messaging , " said @entity236 , adding that she 's kept as mementos a lot of their e-mails and texts -- some of which were unfortunately erased			1
the couple spent copious amounts of time together , giving their virtual courtship a real - world backbone			0
so , when her boyfriend revealed that he loved her via text , it was n't ideal			0
but it was n't a deal breaker , either			0
" before class started i got a text from him that said , ' i love you , ' " she said			0
" he wanted it to be as organic as possible			0
it 's unfortunate that it happened when we were n't physically together , but what are you going to do about it ? " his text was , interestingly enough , sparked by a lengthy letter @entity236 had handwritten and left in his apartment			1
she believes that a handwritten note can communicate things an e-mail can not			0
when it comes to romance , " i think there 's a level of flirtatiousness that helps to sustain a relationship , and that 's what i had every day with @entity240 in person , " @entity236 said			1
now that they 're long distance , the pair makes an effort to fly to see each other when they can			0
but in the interim , " for me and @entity309 , being romantic is having one night a week where [ we 're ] eating together on @entity225 , " she said			0
" i think that 's really romantic			1

technology is n't killing off courtship as much as it 's redefining what it looks like
a new *generation* is adopting digital models for romantic communication
student : " a lot of our relationship has been e-mailing and texting and @entity126 messaging "
video producer : mystery associated with romance is " not as strong as it used to be "
