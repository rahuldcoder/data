@entity0 -- actress @entity4 showed up three weeks early at a @entity0 jail to begin serving her sentence for a theft charge , but it was determined that she would be allowed to serve her time in home confinement , @entity3 's spokesman @entity2 said thursday			1
@entity4 was sentenced may 11 to 120 days in jail , but overcrowding at the facility and state rules could reduce the time she must be confined to her @entity14 , @entity15 , home to about two weeks , according to information previously provided by the sheriff 's office			1
@entity4 , 24 , pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor theft charge stemming from a january incident in which she apparently left a @entity14 jewelry store wearing a gold and diamond necklace for which she had not paid			1
@entity25 judge @entity24 gave the actress until june 17 to begin the sentence , but @entity4 reported to the jail early thursday , @entity2 said			1
once there , it was determined that she was eligible for home confinement instead of jail , he said			0
the actress was fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor her movements and ensure she stays at home , except as allowed by the court , he said			2
early release formulas , required by a federal order to reduce jail overcrowding , will likely reduce the sentence to about 14 days , @entity2 said after the sentencing			0
" because of budget constraints and because we 're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation , nonviolent offenders , lesser crimes , get 20 % of their sentence , " the spokesman explained			0
@entity24 remarked that the discounts on the sentences " seems to be like shopping at @entity49			0
" as part of @entity4 's sentence , @entity24 also ordered that the actress remain on supervised probation until she completes 480 hours of community service			1
but the judge rejected deputy city attorney @entity59 's request for substance abuse counseling for the actress			0
@entity24 said drugs and alcohol are not the root of @entity4 's legal troubles , but " she 's got other problems for which she self - medicates			1
" @entity4 's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007			1
since then , she 's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehabilitation programs			0
after her sentencing , the court released a probation report that said the actress " appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues			0
" " it would appear that the defendant 's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity , " the probation report said , yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail			2
@entity4 tested positive for alcohol use , a violation of probation rules , in february , the report said			2
it also revealed that the drug test failure last august , which resulted in a jail sentence and court - ordered rehab , involved cocaine and amphetamines			2
@entity4 was not at the may 11 hearing , but her lawyer entered a no - contest plea -- equivalent to a guilty plea -- to the misdemeanor theft charge on her behalf			1
" i am glad to be able to put this past me and move on with my life and my career , " @entity4 said in a written statement released by her lawyer			2
" i support the judge 's decision and hold myself accountable for being in this situation			0
" @entity1 's @entity108 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 could have *waited* until june 17 to start her sentence
she may only serve two weeks of a 120 - day sentence
