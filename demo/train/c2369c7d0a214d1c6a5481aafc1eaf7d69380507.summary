a cache of 1,500 works of art -- including masterpieces by @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 -- confiscated by the @entity7 and missing for more than 70 years has been found in @entity8 , according to @entity8 media reports			1
the huge haul of paintings , estimated to be worth more than $ 1 billion , was discovered in an apartment in @entity13 in the spring of 2011 during a raid by @entity16 tax authorities , but its existence has only just come to light with an article in the @entity8 news magazine focus			1
the collection is said to include works by @entity23 masters @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , many of which had been believed destroyed during @entity32 @entity19 reports that the pictures were found when customs police raided a rundown apartment in the @entity37 district of @entity13 during an investigation into suspected tax evasion			1
the recovered paintings are said to have been kept in storage in a secure warehouse in the city ever since			2
@entity8 authorities have refused to confirm or deny any details relating to the discovery			1
@entity48 art stolen by nazis repatriated " the @entity8 government is supporting the state prosecution in @entity53 by supplying advice from experts in the field of so - called degenerate art and the entire issue of @entity60 - looted art , " government spokesman @entity50 said			1
" but we can not comment any of the issues of the ongoing investigation			0
" the full extent of the find is expected to be revealed by art historian @entity66 , an expert on " degenerate art " from the @entity68 , at a news conference in @entity53 on tuesday			2
thousands of pieces of art labeled " degenerate " by the @entity7 were looted from private collections and confiscated from galleries during the 1930s and 1940s ; other works were stolen from @entity78 families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country			1
many paintings remain missing decades later			2
@entity85 , chairman of the @entity86 , said the discovery was " very encouraging in some ways , but there are tens of thousands of these artworks still under dispute , so this is really just a drop in the ocean			0
" " this case shows the extent of organised art robbery which occurred in museums and private collections , " said @entity93 , representative of the @entity94			2
" private collections were almost all in @entity78 possession			0
" feds seize @entity60 - plundered painting the relatives of many of those families whose art collections were stolen are now waiting to find out whether their property forms part of the @entity13 treasure trove -- and whether they can get it back			1
" we demand that the paintings be handed back to their original owners , " @entity93 said			2
" it can not be that like in this case , a sort of moral handling of stolen goods is continued			0
" @entity85 said improvements in technology and wider public knowledge about works looted by the @entity7 mean the tide is turning against those in possession of stolen art. " the risk / reward is going against them			1
it may have been far easier to do it decades ago , but as more databases are set up and there is an increasing focus on the @entity135 , there is less chance for anyone taking part in such transactions			0
" but art experts have questioned why it has taken so long for the @entity13 discovery to be revealed			1
@entity143 of @entity144 said the details of the paintings should have been published online as soon as they were found " so that the entire world could stake a claim			1
" " we were told they they were worried about the number of claimants that would come forward , but two years is a long time to wait , " he said			0
claimants of this era are in their 80s and 90s , and records are disappearing			0
" " there seems to be a problem with transparency here , " @entity93 said			0
" the case was discovered in 2011 ; in 2013 , it became public			0
the question is , what happened during those two years ? "			0
