@entity0 -- cost overruns on big - ticket @entity5 projects have left the @entity8 military facing a budgetary " train wreck " at a time of growing budget deficits , sen. @entity2 said tuesday			1
a littoral combat ship is tested in july			0
the cost to build the ships more than doubled , according to a report			2
@entity2 and sen. @entity16 , @entity17 and the chairman of the @entity19 , said the cost of 95 major weapons systems -- ships , aircraft and armored vehicles -- have ballooned by a total of 30 percent in recent years , to about $ 1.3 trillion			1
the senators announced an effort , including legislation , to rein in that spending and tighten @entity5 oversight			1
with @entity8 troops fighting two wars overseas and personnel costs dominating the defense budget , " we 're facing a train wreck , " said @entity2 , the ranking @entity36 on the committee and the @entity36 's presidential candidate in 2008			1
" we can not continue on this path of escalating costs without at some point making some tough choices , which may endanger our nation 's security , " he said			1
@entity2 and @entity16 singled out the @entity46 's planned construction of littoral combat ships , a class of small vessels designed for coastal operations , for particular criticism			1
@entity16 said the ships are " way beyond " their projected construction time of two years , and the program has grown from a cost per ship of about $ 220 million to more than $ 500 million , according to a november report from the @entity58			2
" we ca n't have a ship that 's a small ship that 's supposed to be built in two years run completely out of control to double or triple or quadruple its original cost estimates , " @entity2 said			1
he also criticized the planned purchase of 28 new @entity65 helicopters for the @entity66 that he said cost " more than @entity67			2
" but @entity66 spokesman @entity69 said tuesday that president @entity70 has put that $ 11 billion order on hold			0
@entity5 spokesman @entity73 said tuesday that the @entity5 is committed to reviewing its big - ticket contracts , " particularly those programs that are underperforming			1
" the presidential helicopter project " is one of those programs , " he said			0
@entity16 and @entity2 said their push will include hearings into military contracting , legislation creating new watchdog posts in the @entity5 and an effort to stiffen congressional oversight of big - ticket programs			1
" the @entity5 has the major responsibility to make sure that these programs are run efficiently			1
@entity88 has an oversight responsibility , " @entity16 said			2
" neither of those activities have been carried out adequately			0
" their announcement comes as @entity70 is scheduled to deliver his budget address to @entity88 , and defense secretary @entity94 is already examining whether to cut back on some of the armed services ' biggest purchases			0
" this moment also presents an opportunity , one of those rare chances to match virtue to necessity , to critically and ruthlessly separate appetites from real requirements , " @entity94 told a @entity19 hearing in january			0
among the other items under scrutiny : the $ 950 billion joint strike fighter program , the @entity110 's $ 200 billion @entity109 and the @entity46 's @entity112 - class attack submarines			0
" we are going to have lots of fights in the next two or three months over various parts of the defense budget , " said @entity113 , an analyst for the nonprofit @entity114			0
the plans have leading defense contractors and members of @entity88 with contractors ' factories in their districts already arguing to keep their programs intact			0
@entity131 's f - 22 program , for instance , employs about 12,000 people in 44 states , its supporters argue			0
but @entity113 said defense spending produces " significantly less " employment than spending in other areas , such as mass transit or health care			2
@entity1 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
