-- i am a medical sociologist , which means i study the health of whole societies			0
i 've spent more than 20 years studying the best possible ways to address alcohol problems in societies -- what works and what does n't to protect people from harm			1
i work as a professor in the @entity13 and at the @entity14			0
this allows me to connect with other scientists who come from very different backgrounds but who want to work together on big problems -- think of a @entity21 , only one focused on protecting health through the collaboration of scientists who study everything from tiny cells to entire societies			0
so three years ago , a pediatric endocrinologist named @entity29 walks into my office and asks for my help			0
@entity29 tells me that he 's finding many connections between the metabolism of fructose ( sugar ) and ethanol ( alcohol ) in his work on metabolic functioning , liver damage and the obesity epidemic			1
@entity29 runs the obesity clinic at @entity43 , where he spends his days trying to help morbidly obese kids who feel hungry all the time			1
one of the saddest effects of sugar overconsumption is to dampen the natural hormones that tell kids ' bodies when they 've eaten enough , leading them to feel hungry even as they overeat			1
@entity29 says he 's also seeing that too much sugar in these kids ' diets causes severe liver damage -- they have even started doing liver transplants on some of the kids in his clinic			2
fast - forward to today , and here 's what we 've learned : -- more people on the planet earth are dying from chronic diseases such as heart disease , stroke , cancer and diabetes than anything else			1
this is even true for developing countries that have turned a critical page on health : people in those countries are now more likely to die from the " diseases of affluence " than from the " diseases of poverty " like malaria and cholera			2
major risk factors in chronic disease , of course , are alcohol , tobacco and junk food consumption			1
-- many of the health hazards of drinking too much alcohol , such as high blood pressure and fatty liver , are the same as those for eating too much sugar			1
when you think about it , this actually makes a lot of sense			0
alcohol , after all , is simply the distillation of sugar			1
where does vodka come from ? @entity106			0
-- we may be thinking about obesity and chronic disease in the wrong way			1
most experts are worried about sugar because it 's " empty calories " that make people fat			1
but what leads to chronic disease is actually something called metabolic syndrome , which can be caused by the toxic effects of sugar			1
-- added sugar at the levels consumed by many @entity124 changes our metabolism -- it raises blood pressure , critically alters the signaling of hormones that turn hunger on and off , and can damage the pancreas and liver			2
worldwide consumption of sugar has tripled over the past 50 years , and along with that has come an obesity pandemic			1
but obesity may just be a marker for the damage caused by the toxic effects of too much sugar			1
this would help explain why up to 40 % of people with the metabolic syndrome -- what leads to diabetes , heart disease and cancer -- are not clinically obese			1
what should we do about all this ? first , we think that the public needs to be better informed about the science of how sugar impacts our health			2
second , we need to take what we know about protecting societies from the health harms of alcohol and apply it to sugar			1
what does n't work is all - out prohibition -- that 's very old - school and often creates more problems than it solves			0
what does work are gentle " supply side " controls , such as taxing products , setting age limits and promoting healthier versions of the product -- like making it cheaper for a person to drink light beer rather than schnapps			0
the reality is that unfettered corporate marketing actually limits our choices about the products we consume			0
if what 's mostly available is junk food and soda , then we actually have to go out of our way to find an apple or a drinking fountain			0
what we want is to actually increase people 's choices by making a wider range of healthy foods easier and cheaper to get			2
turning around obesity and chronic disease will be an uphill political fight , but there 's plenty that concerned people can do : -- contact the @entity124 @entity196 and @entity197 to encourage them to take sugar off the generally regarded as @entity201 ( @entity200 ) list			1
this is what allows food producers to add as much sugar as they want to the products we eat			2
-- support our local , state and federal officials in placing a substantial tax on products that are loaded with sugar			2
ask them to use the proceeds to support a wider range of food options in supermarkets and farmer 's markets			0
-- help protect our kids by getting sports drinks and junk food out of our schools			0
ask our school boards to replace those vending machines with good old - fashioned drinking fountains			0
ask local officials to control the opening hours and marketing tactics of the junk food outlets surrounding our schools			0
that way , kids can walk to school without being barraged by advertising for sugary products that taste good but harm their health			0
we need to remember that many of our most basic public health protections once stood on the same battleground of @entity124 politics as sugar policy does today			2
simple things like requiring a seat belt and having an airbag in your car to save you in a crash were once huge political battles			0
now , we take these things for granted as simple ways to protect the health and well - being of our communities			0
it 's time to turn our attention to sugar			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			1

*researchers* seeing similar effects from too much sugar and too much alcohol
alcohol is simply the distillation of sugar , she says , and sugar should be taxed and regulated
@entity259 : we may be thinking about obesity and chronic disease in the wrong way
she says *tackling* obesity and chronic disease will be hard , but concerned people can do plenty
