-- there 's no bathroom on the right , and @entity4 never asked to be excused so he could kiss a dude			1
and , no , no matter how blinded by the light you may have been , you were n't wrapped up like ... a feminine hygiene product			1
but all those are among the world 's most frequently misquoted song lyrics -- at least according to @entity12			1
the popular music - streaming service conducted an unscientific poll to find the most commonly botched lines from popular songs			1
( of course , nobody had to fess up to getting the words wrong themselves			1
the poll , of 1,042 people , asked for the songs they most commonly hear other people singing incorrectly			1
) the winner ? by a long shot , @entity24 confused the most folks with " @entity27 , " the 1976 hit written and first recorded by @entity28			1
fifty - two percent of respondents reported hearing " wrapped up like a douche / when you 're rollin ' in the night " instead of the correct lyric : " revved up like a deuce / another runner in the night			1
" listen : @entity12 's top misquoted song lyrics @entity4 took the second spot ( 19 % ) with his line " excuse me while i kiss the sky , " from " @entity38 " being confused for the less abstract , albeit more open - minded , " excuse me while i kiss this guy			1
" and in third place , 14 % of respondents said they 've heard " @entity46 , " by @entity44 , mangled into " @entity45			1
" we 're not happy about these garbled lyrics , either			2
seventy percent of respondents said they get annoyed hearing other people sing lyrics wrong			1
they said the most common places they hear frustratingly mangled wording is concerts ( 34 % ) , followed by karaoke bars ( 23 % ) , public transportation ( 20 % ) and the office ( 18 % )			2
five percent of the people who responded to the poll said they " never " get lyrics wrong themselves			1
( might we suggest some early @entity66 to remedy that ? ) here 's the rest of @entity12 's top 10 : -- " @entity70 , " @entity71			1
" hold me closer , @entity73			2
" actual lyric : " hold me closer , tiny dancer			2
" -- " @entity76 , " @entity77			2
