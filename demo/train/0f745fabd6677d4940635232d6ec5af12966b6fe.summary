-- the leader of a shuttering @entity5 coal mining operation on friday blamed the @entity7 administration for the shutdown and for hurting the economy generally with he called a " war on coal , " an assertion the @entity2 pushed back on as false and misleading			1
@entity12 , which is a subsidiary of @entity13 , issued a statement announcing its coal mining operations near @entity16 , in southeastern @entity5 , would be closing five years earlier than expected			1
its founder , @entity17 , personally went to tell the operation 's employees there that they were being laid off			0
the company said that the operation employed 239 people " at its peak , " though there were no firm numbers as to the number that lost their jobs friday beyond that 32 would be reassigned to other positions			0
company leaders -- who have been donors to @entity32 -- claimed the " regulatory actions by president @entity7 and his appointees and followers ( are ) the entire reason " for the closure			1
in fact , they predicted more layoffs to come unless there is a major shift in the political landscape			0
in @entity5 , swing state politics have real - life impact " there will be additional layoffs , not only at @entity13 , but also throughout the @entity49 coal industry due to mr. @entity7 's ' war on coal ' and the destruction that it has caused so many jobs and families in the @entity57 area and elsewhere , " @entity17 said			1
yet @entity2 spokesman @entity58 rebutted that view , pointing to " flexibilities for clean coal standards over the last three years " and the fact @entity49 coal production is on the upswing			1
there were more @entity49 coal miners working this year , for instance , than any year since 1997 and @entity49 coal exports rose 31 % over the previous year , he said			0
" the president has made clear that coal has an important role in our energy economy today , and it will in the future , " @entity58 said			0
" ( that ) is why the administration has worked to make sure that , moving forward , we can continue to rely on a broad range of domestic energy sources from oil to gas , to wind and solar , to nuclear , as well as clean coal			0
" @entity5 is considered a key swing state in this fall 's presidential election , in which @entity7 faces presumptive @entity32 nominee @entity88			2
by the numbers : why @entity5 matters @entity91 officials had made their allegiances clear before the announcement : @entity17 , the corporation 's ceo , is a major @entity32 donor having donated more than $ 150,000 to @entity32 in 2012 alone , and @entity13 's political action committee has similarly given @entity32 upwards of $ 100,000 in the past year			2
@entity98 , the superintendent of the closing @entity12 coal mine , claimed thursday that @entity7 and vice president @entity100 both intend to " destroy so many lives and family livelihoods in this area for no benefit whatsoever			2
" yet @entity105 , the manager of @entity106 in @entity16 , said he did n't believe the coal mining operations closure will negatively impact the area or its businesses			1
" it 's not going to hurt my business , " @entity105 said			0
@entity112 , director of air and water special projects with the environmental group the @entity114 , said that he and his group favor clean energy measures and curing what he described as @entity5 's addiction to coal			2
many of the coal - related regulations being enforced now , he said , are " not really new " -- having been passed , in some form , in 1990 as part of the @entity124			0
rather than pay lobbyists to fight such rules or to inject themselves into the 2012 presidential race , @entity112 said he 'd prefer that utilities focus first on " cleaning up their act " so that residents can breathe , and live , better			0
" we do n't think that public health should be used as a political football , " he said			1
@entity7 campaign sues over @entity5 's cutoff date for early voting @entity7 blasts @entity88 tax plan in @entity5 @entity0 's @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report .			1

@entity12 's coal mining operation near @entity16 , @entity5 , is shuttering 5 years early
@entity7 's regulatory actions are " the entire reason " for the closure , the company says
the @entity2 denies a " war on coal , " noting recent *jumps* in coal production and exports
" public health should ( not ) be used as a political football , " an environmentalist says
