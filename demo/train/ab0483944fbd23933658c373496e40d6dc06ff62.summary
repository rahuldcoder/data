-- @entity2 conservatives deeply admire @entity4 prime minister @entity3			1
in a march story , @entity5 hailed @entity3 as the new " leader of the @entity8 " -- and they did n't mean @entity9			1
the @entity10 and @entity11 have added their own praise			0
@entity3 has achieved more from a weaker position than any conservative leader of recent times			1
a decade ago , @entity9 's conservatives were split between two antagonistic parties			1
@entity3 won the leadership of one of those parties , then negotiated a merger , with himself as leader of the united right			1
he then had to fight a rapid series of elections : in 2004 he reduced the once - dominant liberals to minority status			0
in 2006 , he won just barely enough seats to form a minority government himself			0
he won a stronger minority in 2008 , but only in 2011 did he at last gain the secure majority he 'd sought for a decade			0
under desperately precarious political circumstances -- and in the face of the worst global economic crisis since the 1930s -- @entity3 achieved remarkable things			1
almost 1 million more @entity4 are working today than before the financial crisis -- the best employment record in the @entity39			1
incomes have recovered and surpassed pre-recession peaks			0
@entity9 's national debt burden is lower than that of any other major economy -- and less than half that of the @entity2			1
corporate tax rates are lower in @entity9 than in the @entity2 , and on the present trajectory the same may soon be true of personal income taxes as well			1
how did @entity3 and his conservatives do it ? not the way that @entity2 conservatives are trying to do it			1
@entity2 conservatives have followed a radical path to repeated defeat			1
@entity4 conservatives have followed an incremental path to accumulating success			1
@entity2 then might benefit as much as @entity4 from reading " the longer i 'm prime minister , " a lively new book about the secrets of @entity3 's survival and success , written by one of @entity9 's leading political columnists , @entity65 of @entity68 's magazine			1
the title plays off a joke @entity3 frequently tells on himself : " the longer i 'm prime minister " -- pause for dramatic effect -- " the longer i 'm prime minister			1
" it 's a joke based on a grim political reality : twenty - one men and one woman have served as prime minister of canada			1
six of them have lasted less than a year			0
three more lasted less than three years			0
on the other hand , five prime ministers served more than 10 years			2
if the 54 - year - old @entity3 completes his current term , he will have served for nine years			1
one more win after that , and he will have joined the champions			0
" my models are n't conservative prime ministers , " @entity65 quotes @entity3			1
" my models are successful prime ministers			2
" @entity65 is not especially sympathetic to @entity3 's politics or purposes			2
but he has invested the close attention necessary to understand them			0
as @entity65 explains , @entity3 's first priority is to last			2
as @entity3 himself said in a 2004 speech that outlined his political program before a friendly audience , incremental gains are " inevitably " the only real ones			2
revolutionary projects almost always fail			0
" the surest rebuttal @entity3 can offer to a half - century of @entity103 hegemony , " @entity65 points out , " is not to race around doing things the next @entity103 could undo			2
" the better rebuttal , instead , is to build a counter-hegemony of one 's own			0
what could be more foolish than futile provocative actions that serve only to consolidate the other guy 's advantages ? @entity2 conservatives enamored of their bold programs may disdain @entity3 's caution			1
" because he is temperamentally the most conservative @entity4 prime minister of his lifetime , he will not ever run out of ideas for conservative things to do			1
so on any day he has a choice , he can do the big conservative thing that would be the end of his career , or he can do some of the small conservative things that wo n't			0
he is amazed that earlier leaders had a hard time choosing			0
" as @entity65 points out , however , a politician can accomplish a lot by the simple act of refraining from committing career suicide			0
" how many decisions does a prime minister make in a day ? sixty ? a hundred ? almost none go reported			1
he does n't even have to keep most of them secret : the rush of events ensures they wo n't be noticed and assayed by the ( press ) gallery			0
as the 2011 election approached , @entity3 was approaching two thousand days in office			2
imagine how different the outcome would have been if a different prime minister , with different assumptions , prejudices , and instincts had made those thousands of decisions			1
" many @entity2 @entity147 argue that elections are won by boldly standing on principle			2
sen. @entity150 articulated just that idea in his speech friday to @entity154 's @entity153			0
he lauded the @entity155 who nearly pushed the nation into bankruptcy as " a profile in courage who stood strong and listened to the @entity2 people			2
" in fact , of course , those @entity155 appalled and frightened the @entity2 people -- and badly damaged themselves in the process			1
after the worst miscalculation of his own career -- a failed maneuver that nearly brought down his government in 2008 -- @entity3 explained the lesson he 'd learned : never surprise the voters			2
do not outpace the consent they have granted			0
lead from the front -- but never from very far in front			0
as for those bold " @entity180 " speeches so cherished by conservatives these days ... they are to be avoided at all costs			1
@entity65 observes the @entity3 speechmaking operation close up : " he works at removing memorable turns of phrase and identifiable ideas from his speeches			1
he puts great effort into flattening his prose			0
" why ? " all that stuff that sounds good in speeches -- ' we must , ' ' i will never , ' ' @entity191 my words ' -- all that becomes a line in the sand			2
it gets held against you later			0
so that stuff 's coming out			0
" i know harper a little , and i can attest : it requires immense self - control to keep this relentlessly interesting intellect sounding dull			0
but politics is not a business for the self - indulgent			0
" observers looking for something to dislike get less fodder than they would if he were a loudmouth			0
" as i write , the @entity3 government is facing a moment of controversy			2
@entity3 appointees to the unelected upper chamber of the @entity4 @entity216 are accused of cheating on their expenses , and the opposition parties are making a familiar uproar over the familiar questions of what did the prime minister know and when did he know it			1
it 's all very exciting , and likely all very fleeting			0
what is lasting is governance			0
@entity2 conservatives should rediscover it -- and @entity65 ' entertaining and insightful study of @entity231 's most governance - minded conservative offers an excellent place to start			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			2

@entity235 : @entity3 shows path @entity2 conservatives should follow
he says @entity4 prime minister avoids " @entity180 " speeches , bold policy shifts
@entity9 has *emerged* strongly from world economic crisis , @entity235 writes
@entity246 : by contrast , @entity2 conservatives have appalled and frightened @entity2
