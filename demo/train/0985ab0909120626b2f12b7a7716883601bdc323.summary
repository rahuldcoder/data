-- at first blush , it sounds like a torturous way to read an 8,500 - word short story			1
but in a nod to the social media age , @entity5 is offering up new fiction on @entity9 in a series of 140 - character bursts			1
" @entity16 , " a new story by @entity19 - winning author @entity18 , was to begin appearing on the @entity9 account thursday at 8 p.m. et. a single line will be published every minute for the next hour , then from 8 - 9 p.m. on each of the following nine nights , through june 2			1
while waiting for new snippets might not sound like the most fun way to consume a story , lovers of the written word can take some solace in the fact that @entity27 , no stranger to nontraditional storytelling , wrote " @entity16 " with @entity9 in mind			1
@entity27 's 2010 novel , " @entity30 , " won the @entity31 and the @entity32			2
" @entity16 , " she says , takes a character from that book and tells a " spy - thriller " version of her tale			0
" this is not a new idea , of course , but it 's a rich one -- because of the intimacy of reaching people through their phones , and because of the odd poetry that can happen in 140 characters , " she said in a @entity5 post about the experiment			2
" i found myself imagining a series of terse mental dispatches from a female spy of the future , working undercover by the @entity54			0
i wrote these bulletins by hand in a @entity58 notebook that had eight rectangles on each page			0
" @entity27 said the story was originally twice its present length and that she spent about a year writing and revising it -- using @entity9 's character - counting tool to make sure the final lines would make the cut			1
as @entity27 's statement suggests , she 's not the first to tackle fiction on @entity9 and other digital short forms			1
in @entity72 , " keitai shousetsu , " or " cellphone novels " written in the form of text messages , have become perennial best - sellers since originating in the early 2000s			0
in 2008 , @entity77 launched the " @entity83 " project in which six of its authors used interactive media , including @entity9 , to tell new tales			2
( one , @entity85 's " slice , " was told as a series of blog posts and tweets from the story 's main character and her parents )			0
and in 2009 , author and noted @entity9 - phile @entity93 worked with @entity95 on an interactive novel built from tweets			0
@entity27 is no stranger to nontraditional approaches to writing herself			2
" @entity104 " hovers somewhere between being a novel and a series of related short stories about an aging music - industry executive and other rock ' n ' roll characters			0
in it , one chapter appears as a @entity107 presentation			0
in july , @entity108 printed @entity27 's " to do , " a short story told as a seemingly innocuous list of chores			1
call " @entity16 " gimmicky if you like , but you ca n't claim it 's just @entity27 wanting to screw around on @entity9			1
she has an account , but before two tweets promoting thursday 's serialization , she 'd only posted four times since signing up in 2010			0
and fear not if you ca n't stand the thought of reading a story tucked into your @entity9 feed ( of , for that matter , if you ca n't stand the thought of @entity9 )			2
the @entity5 will be publishing a daily summary of the story - so - far on its @entity126 fiction blog			1
the story also will appear in its entirety in the venerable magazine 's upcoming science - fiction issue .			0

the @entity5 was to begin posting a short story tweet by tweet on @entity9 thursday night
@entity18 's " @entity16 " will be serialized each night for 10 nights
a @entity19 winner , @entity27 has embraced nontraditional storytelling
other authors have tried fiction on @entity9 and in other digital forms
