-- march brought us a series of what pundits like to call " provocations " by @entity5			1
on closer inspection , @entity7 has opted for rhetoric over actual military actions			0
while @entity12 's pursuit of nuclear and missile capability remains worrisome , escalating signals of resolve could suggest nervousness as much as strength			1
so , is the regime in trouble ? the first round of saber - rattling came as the @entity23 deliberated on a new sanctions resolution after @entity5 's satellite launch in december and its third nuclear test in february			1
the @entity27 of the @entity28 , the @entity29 and a party organ dealing with @entity32 relations began putting out public statements in an effort to chip away at the institutions of the armistice , such as military hot lines and the stationing of a @entity5 military mission in @entity40			1
@entity5 ultimately " withdrew " from the armistice , but it had done so before and it is not clear what its recent statements actually mean			1
the armistice is not a peace treaty , but merely a cease fire			0
the armistice is stable not because of verbal commitments but because of the deterrent capability of both sides			0
is anything really different as a result of this " re-withdrawal " ? it does n't seem like it			0
equally unfortunate was @entity5 's decision to renege on a number of @entity32 agreements , such as a @entity32 agreement on the denuclearization of the peninsula			2
but @entity7 's pursuit of nuclear weapons had made this and a number of other agreements moot in any case			0
@entity5 's bluster had little if any effect on the @entity23 debate			2
if anything , its threats may have been counterproductive			0
although the resolution was portrayed as the result of a @entity77 - @entity76 cabal , @entity72 also signed on and the resolution was passed unanimously			1
the measure opens the door for tighter financial sanctions , and there is some preliminary evidence that @entity84 may be cooperating in tightening economic exchanges with the country			0
the next round of statements came as @entity5 and the @entity77 and @entity76 entered an annual military training cycle			1
these periods are always fraught with tension , as @entity7 denounces the routine exercises as provocative			0
as the country effectively mobilizes , the @entity5 press is filled with pictures of @entity12 directing the troops in exercises , some of which were reportedly manipulated with @entity100 to increase their effect			1
as a result of these exercises , there is some background of what might be called " ritualized escalation " at work			0
but @entity5 did possibly make one major misstep in arguing that it might undertake a pre-emptive nuclear strike			2
announcing an intention to pre-empt is dangerous because even small tactical movements can be misinterpreted			0
needless to say , such statements have to be taken seriously , and , if anything , the @entity77 and @entity76 may have over-reacted by such a public display of force			2
in particular , the @entity77 announced a major new ballistic missile defense initiative , training runs by @entity119 and b2 bombers , and an updated @entity77 - @entity121			0
in the last few days , the @entity77 was again quite public about its deployment of jet fighters to the peninsula as well			0
there is a larger game at work here that probably centers on the difficult - to - read domestic politics of @entity5			1
it is by no means assured that @entity12 has fully consolidated his authority			1
by ramping up rhetoric , but exercising restraint with respect to actual military actions , the regime can count on the fact that the @entity77 and @entity76 are not going to take the first step either			1
the result is that @entity5 's exercises and threats of retaliation have been successful in deterring attack , even though none was coming			1
the regime can claim some sort of victory in staring down @entity77 threats in its two big political meetings this week , the timing of which suggest that some of the rhetoric has been driven by domestic politics			1
@entity5 's nuclear and missile programs constitute problems that the five parties in the regionâ € ” @entity72 , @entity157 , @entity76 , @entity158 and the @entity159 € ” need to address through concerted action			1
but overheated rhetoric , however disconcerting , is not the same as an intention to attack			0
coolly maintaining our deterrent and not over-reacting to hyperbole is the proper course of action			0
with luck , the leadership will pivot away from nuclear posturing toward economic reform , the main thing that the people of @entity5 really need			2
editor 's note : due to an editing error , an earlier version of this essay said @entity5 instead of the @entity77 announced new military initiatives			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity183 : @entity5 is mostly *bluffing* in its threats against @entity76
@entity183 : escalating signals of resolve suggest nervousness as much as strength
he says @entity12 may not have fully consolidated his authority
@entity183 : as a result , some of the rhetoric could be driven by domestic politics
