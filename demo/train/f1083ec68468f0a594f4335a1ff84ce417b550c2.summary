embattled @entity1 anchor @entity0 may have some more explaining to do			1
on may 3 , 2011 , just two days after the daring @entity4 raid that killed @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity0 said on his @entity1 show , " now , people might be hearing about @entity4			1
i happen to have the great honor of flying into @entity10 with them at the start of the war			0
" with this statement @entity0 asserted that he was embedded with one of the most covert units in the @entity18 military and flew with the seals into @entity20 in march 2003 as the war there began			1
when asked about this claim , a @entity24 spokesman @entity23 told @entity2 : " we do not embed journalists with that unit or any other unit that conducts counterterrorism missions			0
bottom line -- no. " could @entity0 have simply hitched a ride into @entity20 with @entity34 outside of the formal embedding process ? this seems quite unlikely			1
a seal officer told @entity2 , " that early in the conflict , there were only missions taking place , not bouncing between outstations			0
" @entity0 was suspended this week for six months without pay as anchor of " @entity45 " after it emerged that he had embellished the tale of a helicopter ride in @entity20 , claiming incorrectly to have been on a chopper that was hit by rocket fire			2
@entity1 is conducting a fact - checking investigation of @entity0 ' statements			2
the @entity53 first reported that there were questions about @entity0 ' statements about the @entity19			1
@entity57 has made further claims about his purportedly tight relationship with the men of @entity4 , saying on the " @entity61 " in january 2013 , " about six weeks after the @entity5 raid , i got a white envelope and in it was a thank - you note , unsigned			1
and in it was a piece of the fuselage of the blown - up @entity68 in that courtyard			0
sent to me by one of my friends			0
" the @entity19 officer says this seems unlikely given that " there 's no connection between the guys that went in early ( ' 03 ) and the guys at @entity78 , " an abbreviation for the city of @entity81 , @entity6 , where the @entity5 raid was carried out			1
also , why @entity4 would want to thank @entity0 after the @entity5 raid is inexplicable as he had nothing to do with any element of it			1
in the course of reporting the book " manhunt : the ten - year search for @entity5 -- from 9/11 to @entity81 , " i interviewed dozens of the key officials who played a role in finding @entity5 or planned or executed the raid that killed him			1
none of them mentioned @entity0 as having any role in any of this			2
two of the key players i interviewed for the book had been given mementos by @entity4			2
one was @entity102 , the @entity103 director who oversaw the successful hunt for @entity5			2
and the other was gen. @entity106 , the former commander of @entity107 that oversees @entity4 , who was presented with an @entity18 flag that members of the unit had taken on the @entity5 mission			1
but what makes @entity0 claim that he was given a piece of the helicopter that went down at the compound in @entity81 where @entity5 was living even more implausible is what happened the night of the raid			1
members of @entity4 were flying in " stealth " helicopters that radar ca n't detect			2
one of those helicopters crashed at @entity5 's compound in the first minute or so of the raid			1
after the helicopter crashed , the @entity19 killed both of @entity5 's bodyguards , his son and @entity5			1
they then went around the compound picking up @entity5 's computer hard drives and documents			2
what else has @entity1 dug up on @entity0 ? all of this took about 30 minutes			0
by now there was great anxiety that @entity6 army units or others unknown would arrive at the scene , and there might be a firefight			0
the @entity19 decided to leave as soon as possible			0
the @entity19 set explosives on the downed helicopter to blow it up so that its stealth technology would not fall into the wrong hands			0
they detonated a massive charge inside the downed helicopter and immediately departed the scene			0
if @entity0 ' story is true , then during all this intense drama one of the @entity19 took the time to pick up a piece of the damaged helicopter fuselage that he would later send to his favorite news anchor			1
three weeks after the raid , the helicopter tail , which had survived the crash , was returned to the @entity18 by @entity6			0
it 's also implausible that a @entity34 member would have then acquired a piece of this tail fuselage to send to @entity0			0
how @entity0 ' @entity20 story changed @entity2 asked @entity1 to comment on @entity0 and the @entity19 , but the network is not publicly discussing the issue while it conducts its investigation of a number of claims he has made that also relate to his coverage of the @entity168 as well as of @entity169			1
@entity0 also has not been commenting			0
in the news business there is a sardonic phrase about stories that do n't quite pass the smell test			0
they are called " a story too good to check			0
" unfortunately , for @entity0 his @entity178 6 stories , among others , that may have been " too good to check , " are now being checked .			0

@entity0 said he traveled with @entity4 , got memento from @entity5 raid
@entity184 says claims may require review since @entity19 took great pains to be covert
