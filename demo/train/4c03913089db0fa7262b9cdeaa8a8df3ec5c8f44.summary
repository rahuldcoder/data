five hundred and one days in an rv - size space capsule			1
will they still be speaking when they return ? the @entity5 is seeking to send two people -- potentially a middle - aged married couple -- to space in a capsule that would pass within 100 miles of @entity10			1
although no formal application process has begun , the @entity10 mission masterminds are already receiving résumés and technology ideas from interested people , said @entity16 , president of @entity17 , which is developing technologies for the mission that 's hoping to launch in 2018			1
more about the mission whether the money to finance the @entity10 mission materializes remains to be seen , but if it does happen : who would these space adventurers be , and how would they cope ? it 's never been tried before , so really , no one knows			1
who should go ? a rigorous process will be put in place for selecting the crew , @entity16 said			2
a man and a woman are sought for the roles to " represent humanity , " she said ; a married couple is " preferred " but not required			1
" you want to make sure that you start out with a relationship between the two people that go on this mission that is on really solid footing , that they know how to pick themselves up after a falling - out , " @entity16 said			1
@entity16 said she and husband @entity43 , ceo of @entity45 , are " intrigued " by the idea of being the pioneers to go on the mission			2
they have experience in close quarters , having spent two years with six other people sealed inside @entity52 , a research facility situated on a little over 3 acres in @entity54 , in the early 1990s			1
" it 's always helpful to have somebody help buoy you in difficult times and problem - solve with and to share the marvelous moments with as well , " she said of living there with her husband			1
" i think it really helped us be productive crew members			2
" friends who have known each other for decades , or siblings who get along well and are comfortable spending long periods of time with one another , would also be suitable for this sort of situation , said @entity73 , assistant professor at @entity74 , who is not involved with the mission			2
but there is some evidence from extreme environments on @entity79 to support the married couple idea , says @entity81 of the @entity82 , who has studied more than 1,000 @entity83 who have spent winters in @entity85 over a four - decade period			1
based on @entity81 ' studies at the @entity88 , the most stable individuals and those with the most stable relationships are middle - aged married couples			1
that works out well for space travel , given that older people have less time left in their lives for space radiation to potentially cause cancer , @entity73 said			2
radiation is also associated with infertility , so the couple should not be seeking to have children after the mission			2
prolonged separation from family and friends back home is a huge source of stress for people in isolated , confined environments , @entity81 said			1
having a close confidant in space would allow them to share their day - to - day experiences with someone they love and trust			1
@entity121 astronaut @entity120 , who has logged more than 4,330 hours in space , agreed : " often , work that is as demanding as ours in terms of time away from family			2
think it might be great to be able to spend that kind of time with your sweetheart			2
" will two people get along ? of course , the behavioral quirks and annoyances that you might easily brush aside on @entity79 would be magnified in a confined space over 501 days			2
even in a healthy marital relationship , there can be such a thing as too much contact , @entity81 said			0
nobody really knows the ideal size of a crew to travel this long , but @entity143 , professor emeritus at the @entity144 , is skeptical about having just two people			0
if one of them is emotionally unavailable , the other is out of luck			0
( as for whether sex has ever been tried in space , " there are rumors but no official acknowledgment , " @entity143 said			0
) " when both of you are under stress -- and these two people would be under the same level of stress , the same kind of stress -- each of them would want emotional support and be too focused on their own problems to give it to the other , " @entity143 said			1
in his view , it 's better to have a team with some amount of diversity , where no one background or nationality predominates			0
the @entity172 usually has a crew of six these days , and that 's worked out well , he said			0
there are other challenges : if one person were to get sick , the remaining crew member would need to take over all tasks to keep the vehicle operational , @entity73 said			1
in @entity52 , which is much bigger than a space capsule , @entity16 and @entity181 never got on each other 's nerves , she said ; it was others who irked them , so the couple could " rally together			0
" but whether any given couple who goes to @entity10 would still want to be together after 501 days is anyone 's guess , experts say			1
psychological difficulties scientists do not have data from actual missions to @entity10 , but situations of isolation and confinement on @entity79 give us some clues as to how things might go			1
in the @entity212 experiment , a collaboration between the @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 space agencies , a crew of six men was locked in a chamber near @entity214 for 520 days to simulate a @entity10 trip			1
the crew received no fresh food or fresh air and could not see the sun. a recent study in the journal @entity221 found that most crew members experienced sleep disturbances of some kind but found a trend toward increased sleep and rest as the mission went on			0
one crew member appeared to live on a 25 - hour day instead of 24			1
researchers also noted " behavioral aspects of torpor " in the crew , akin to hibernation of some birds and animals			0
in his @entity85 studies , @entity81 and colleagues found that in a psychologically healthy group , about 5 % of people experience clinically significant psychological symptoms			1
these include depression , anxiety , substance abuse problems , sleep disorders and adjustment disorders relating to not getting along with crewmates			0
however , most people do well , he said , and see a lot of benefit from participating in the experience -- " definitely an increase in feelings of self - confidence , self - efficacy -- the belief that if they can handle this , they can pretty much handle anything			1
" in @entity52 , where @entity16 's days involved pruning shears , plants and a two - way radio , the crew of eight did n't exactly live in psychological peace			2
@entity16 remembers standing in the sweet potato field one day , and " it was like a time portal opened			0
" in her mind , she was a child again , having an argument with one of her brothers			0
such vivid flashbacks have also occurred to people living in @entity85 , she said			1
the @entity52 group eventually sought and received psychological counseling via telephone			0
bored , bored and bored 40 minutes later ? " we 've got to select for people that can maintain upbeat and happy attitude in the face of adversity and that are resilient , " @entity16 said			0
aboard the @entity172 , astronauts often enjoy just gazing out the window at @entity79 from afar			0
@entity291 astronaut @entity290 has a popular @entity293 account that he uses to post extraordinary photos of the planet			0
but a couple en route to @entity10 would see @entity79 shrink until it 's a dot among many others in the lonely sky			1
" there 's going to be , i 'm quite sure , a feeling of separation that no one has experienced before , " @entity143 said			0
do n't forget the communication delay			0
a message may take as long as 40 minutes to travel to @entity79 and back , and there may be times when communication with the ground is not possible at all			0
if a crew member is having a breakdown and someone on @entity79 is trying to counsel him or her , @entity73 says , it will take 20 minutes for a message such as " try to think calming thoughts " to reach the spacefarer and another 20 minutes for an acknowledgment to get back to @entity79			0
one solution to the boredom question could be time - release entertainment packages , @entity143 said			2
in other words , some movies or music will not become " unlocked " until a given amount of time has passed so that the couple does n't blow through all of their entertainment at once			0
@entity16 said the @entity52 crew created music using the sounds from the animals and machinery in the biosphere			0
music - making or reading would be options on the @entity10 journey , too , she said			1
eventually , presumably , @entity10 would come into view			1
" to look down on @entity10 and be the first people to see , potentially , our future home planet -- " @entity16 interrupted herself to let out a high - pitched " @entity345 ! " -- " gives me chills just thinking about it			1
" ... and other health issues besides mental factors , gravity differences in space present a slew of physiological challenges that are n't easily simulated on @entity79 over long periods of time			0
there 's evidence that the visual system can be impaired , and the weakening of bones and muscle may occur , @entity73 said			0
how the two people aboard the space capsule would deal with these sorts of issues , on top of mental stress , remains to be seen -- as does whether the mission will actually launch as envisioned in january 2018			2
" i 'm all for supporting this , and i certainly am a big proponent of human spaceflight , but i wonder if all of this can be figured out in five years , " @entity73 said			0
