as @entity0 landed in @entity2 's capital wednesday , president @entity4 's message to @entity5 -- only 500 miles away in @entity6 -- was clear : stay put			1
@entity4 's trip to the former @entity10 state , ahead of this week 's @entity11 in @entity12 , is meant to reassure nervous @entity13 that @entity5 's support for separatists in @entity16 does n't mean he has a free pass for territorial gains elsewhere			1
in a speech in @entity20 , @entity4 said the vision of a @entity13 dedicated to peace and freedom is " threatened by @entity25 's aggression against @entity16 , " but said @entity11 will not allow that aggression to go unchecked			1
" we will defend our @entity11 allies , and that means every ally , " he said			1
" we will be here for @entity2			0
... you lost your independence once before			0
with @entity11 , you will never lose it again			0
" added to the schedule only last month , the stop in @entity2 supplements the message coming from @entity11 leaders gathering in @entity39 , @entity12 , who are set to announce the positioning of troops and equipment closer to @entity25 in @entity13			1
in earlier comments alongside @entity2 's president , @entity4 recalled the " deep ties " between the two nations as he announced plans for additional @entity47 @entity0 units to be based in @entity2 as part of a bolstering of @entity11 forces in the region			1
" one of our goals at the summit over the next several days is to once again project unity across @entity11 on behalf of @entity16 's efforts to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity , " @entity4 said			1
he added that @entity25 was " paying a heavy price for its actions , " in part through @entity66 sanctions imposed over @entity16 , and that @entity11 is poised to do more to help @entity16 defend itself			1
he said more @entity68 @entity11 members need to spend a full 2 % of their gross domestic product on defense to keep @entity11 strong			1
the approaching @entity11 summit is an opportunity for these countries to pledge this , he said			0
every ally must do it , " he said			0
@entity11 needs to create ' high - readiness force , ' secretary general says the @entity11 leaders also must confront the separate threat of militant islamists making gains in @entity84 and @entity85 , and the brutal beheading of a second @entity47 by @entity87 , also known as @entity87 or the " @entity88			1
" asked about his strategy on the extremist group , @entity4 said : " the bottom line is this : our objective is clear , and that is to degrade and destroy @entity87 so it 's no longer a threat not just to @entity85 , but also to the region and to the @entity47			1
" in order for us to accomplish that , the first phase has been to make sure we 've got an @entity85 government that 's in place , and that we are blunting the momentum that @entity87 was carrying out			2
" and the airstrikes have done that			0
but now , what we need to do is make sure that we 've got the regional strategy in place that can support an ongoing effort , not just in the air , but on the ground , to move that forward			0
" analyst : @entity11 must adapt the original reason for the summit was to determine how @entity11 's mission will proceed in @entity116 when combat troops depart at the end of the year			1
but the global unrest , while causing political strife for @entity4 in the @entity47 , could provide a new purpose for the 65 - year - old @entity11 alliance , which is suffering an " identity crisis , " according to one analyst			1
@entity25 official : @entity25 is emotionally in @entity16 , its troops are not @entity5 's actions in @entity25 have " required @entity11 to really adapt and change fairly dramatically , " said @entity128 , who directs the @entity13 program at the @entity130 in @entity131			1
" in some ways , @entity11 should thank @entity5 , because it was really searching for its purpose , " @entity133 said			0
@entity136 @entity11 members that border @entity25 , watching the once unthinkable breach of @entity16 's borders , are looking to the military alliance to affirm its commitment to the @entity143 's @entity142 , which provides for collective defense of states under attack			1
@entity16 is n't a @entity11 member , though leaders did invite the country 's new president , @entity149 , to @entity12 this week			1
other former @entity10 states , like @entity2 , @entity152 , and @entity153 , joined @entity11 in the past decade , hoping to bolster ties to the @entity155 while increasing their own security frameworks			0
as reassurance to those countries , @entity11 leaders plan to approve the creation of a " high - readiness " force that places new equipment and thousands of troops in @entity13			2
@entity16 warns of return to ' full - scale war ' @entity167 officials say the move is meant to be defensive rather than a provocation for @entity25 , though initial reaction from the @entity171 -- which called the move an " external threat " -- foreshadowed a potential escalation of the crisis			2
@entity11 and @entity25 have agreed since 1997 that no permanent @entity11 troops will be positioned in @entity13 , meaning member states will rotate forces through bases closest to @entity25			1
@entity180 , @entity4 's top adviser for @entity68 affairs , said leaders will describe the new effort as a " persistent " force in the easternmost countries , rather than " permanent			2
" " we will see persistent rotation , persistent exercises to ensure that @entity2 and that other countries in @entity190 and @entity13 are provided the reassurance from @entity11 and the presence of @entity11 needed to meet their security needs , " he said			0
opinion : what 's @entity25 doing in @entity16 , and what can the @entity155 do ? battling @entity87 not on the official agenda in @entity12 , the ongoing spread of @entity87 fighters in @entity85 and @entity84 will nonetheless play a major role in @entity4 's discussions in @entity12			1
the meeting comes after a video posted tuesday that shows the beheading of a second @entity47 , @entity206			0
the killing of @entity206 follows a threat made by @entity87 last month during the videotaped beheading of @entity47 journalist @entity210			0
the latest video threatens the life of another man , a @entity214 citizen			0
@entity4 has said he wants to form a coalition of governments willing to take on the group , which has taken over huge swaths of territory and terrorized ethnic minorities			0
officials say that could include a role for @entity11 , though in what capacity is so far unclear -- after all , @entity4 himself has n't yet decided whether to undertake airstrikes against @entity87 in @entity84			1
western @entity68 leaders must also confront the growing threat of " homegrown terrorism " -- citizens leaving to fight with militant groups in @entity84 and @entity85 , and potentially returning to stage a terror attack at home			1
the host of the @entity11 summit , @entity214 prime minister @entity236 , already announced new measures to combat that threat after a @entity240 - accented militant was filmed beheading journalist @entity210			2
@entity87 video shows beheading of second journalist " there will have to be an acknowledgment that individual @entity68 countries , and certainly the @entity47 , are taking action , actively working militarily on issues relating to @entity85 and then potentially @entity84 , " said @entity244 , the director of the international security program at the @entity130			2
@entity236 lays out plans to counter @entity214 jihadi threat @entity116 's future just as the @entity47 is anxiously watching the final outcome of @entity116 's recent election , @entity11 member states are wondering what their role will be there after this year ends			1
both candidates in the contested vote have said they 'll sign an agreement allowing @entity47 troops to remain there past 2014			0
but without a winner , the @entity263 remains unsigned			0
hanging over the decision is the security situation in @entity85 , which completely unraveled after @entity47 troops ' withdrawal			2
neither @entity4 nor his @entity11 counterparts want the same thing to happen in @entity116			1
gunmen target spy agency in @entity116 " we 're moving into a world in which @entity11 will be less salient in @entity116 , but in which we want to capitalize on the lessons that we 've learned , the partnerships that we 've built , " @entity180 said			2
no expansion @entity11 last admitted new members in 2009 , but leaders are quick to note this year 's summit is n't about expansion			2
the appetite for letting countries like @entity285 and @entity286 -- labeled " aspirant countries " -- into the club has waned			0
it 's hard enough to get the 28 current members to agree on things , officials say			0
case in point : @entity11 is having a tough time convincing its members to spend more on their militaries , a requirement for membership			2
the @entity47 spends about 4.4 % of its gross domestic product on defense , according to @entity11 figures ; the @entity68 average is 1.6 %			0
@entity11 's guidelines encourage countries to spend at least 2 % of their gdp on defense			0
" part of the reason i think this @entity11 meeting is going to be so important is to refocus attention on the critical function that @entity11 plays to make sure that every country is contributing in order to deliver on the promise of our article 5 assurances , " @entity4 said at a news conference last week			2
but analysts say that as long as economic conditions in @entity13 remain bleak , countries will remain hesitant to ramp up their military spending , even as external threats grow			0
" the @entity16 crisis has been a wake - up call , " said @entity133 , the @entity13 program director at @entity130			0
" now , whether the @entity68 will hit the snooze button or not , again , i do n't know , but it has certainly shaken them , that they have allowed their military defense spending to atrophy to a point where they are now vulnerable			0

" we will defend our @entity11 allies , " president @entity4 says
@entity335 " threatened by @entity25 's aggression against @entity16 , " @entity4 says
militant @entity338 ' gains in @entity85 and @entity84 also cause for *concern* for @entity11 members
