-- the goals president @entity2 set out tuesday in his @entity3 -- including cutting pollution from coal plants and aggressively pursuing clean energy alternatives -- wo n't solve all the challenges of climate change , but they are a big first step in protecting the planet from its worst effects			1
getting serious about solutions is critically important , especially now and especially for the @entity13			1
why the rush ? climate change is driven by emissions of a range of heat - trapping gases , especially the total emissions of carbon dioxide , which have been pumping out since the beginning of the @entity22			1
how much ? through 2012 , that total is about 1,700 billion tons of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion and cutting down forests			0
in 2012 , carbon dioxide emissions in the @entity13 were 19.4 tons per person or about 750 pounds per person per week			1
per capita carbon dioxide emissions in the @entity13 may be lower now than they were in 1990 , but the average @entity13 still emits three times the global average			1
global annual carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow rapidly , with emissions in 2012 more than 50 % above 1990 levels			0
recently , and for the first time in more than 2 million years , the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere climbed above 400 parts per million , 37 % higher than in 1800			2
the resulting global warming , about 1.5 degrees @entity41 , will persist for at least 1,000 years			0
with every passing year , the pool of total carbon dioxide emissions grows bigger , causing more warming -- and more warming leads to greater damages from climate , weather extremes like heat waves , heavy rainfall , and coastal storm surge , as well as altered crop yields , threats to human health , and increased risks of wildfire			1
the first step ? address the root of the issue , and this is why the action @entity2 outlined is smart			1
the plan recognizes the breadth of the problem and focuses on a wide range of emissions sources			0
it also recognizes that not all the damages can be avoided and that building resilience needs to be a part of the package			0
taking action now is also cost - effective			0
slowing and eventually stopping emissions will take time			0
the global energy system producing most of the carbon dioxide emissions is massive , and includes thousands of power plants and more than a billion vehicles			1
the components of the energy system are long - lasting : cars are driven for one to two decades			2
power plants are designed to run for up to a half - century			1
buildings , which use energy for heating , cooling , lighting , and running equipment , can stand for a century or more			2
as things stand now , these realities commit us to continuing emissions into the future			0
each new coal - fired power plant that goes online or inefficient vehicle that hits the road extends that commitment			0
in principle , we can retire existing infrastructure -- like energy - inefficient buildings and carbon - intensive power plants -- early , but such a rapid transformation of an entire energy system would be exorbitantly expensive , essentially because it involves scrapping equipment that has not lived out its useful life			1
building the energy system for the 21st century ambitiously but gradually , starting now , controls the costs by building for the long run and by enabling markets to innovate and drive down costs			0
why is @entity13 leadership so important ? first , the @entity13 has the necessary skills in science and technology , the tradition of innovation , and the mature capital markets to boldly seize opportunities			1
building the energy system of the 21st century is perhaps the greatest business opportunity of the era			0
it will involve a wide range of technologies that emit little or no carbon dioxide , with greatly increased energy efficiency in vehicles , buildings , and equipment			0
second , the @entity13 is the only nation that can truly focus the world 's attention on the climate problem			1
when the @entity13 hangs back , it is easy for other countries to question goals or get tangled in internal politics			2
@entity13 leadership is critical in supercharging the international effort			2
today is the day to start			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			2

@entity139 : @entity13 urgently needs to heed @entity2 's @entity3
he says we *'ve* been pumping massive amounts of *co2* into atmosphere since 1800s
he says our buildings , cars , power plants commit us to to a path that needs to change
field : if we do n't , we face weather extremes , threats to human health
