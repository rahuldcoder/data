@entity0 -- the justices on the @entity3 know very well their rulings can send immediate political shock waves , and those just intensify in a presidential election year			1
so there is an unusual internal dynamic at work of what cases the court hears and when			2
unlike the other parts of the judiciary , the @entity3 is a discretionary body			2
they stingily pick which cases go on the docket and when			0
in fact , only about 1 % of appeals are accepted and fully reviewed			0
but certain legal fights are so important and time - sensitive , this court of last resort is often powerless to refuse or delay			2
that is true of the current challenges to the health care reform law , which will be argued monday through wednesday			0
an expected june ruling in an election year will put the court front and center for voters come november			1
the justices by nature are loathe to get involved in such highly partisan disputes			0
but sometimes often have no choice			0
preview : ' the implications ... are impossible to overstate ' the 2000 @entity38 case ultimately settled the fight over counting @entity41 's ballots , giving @entity42 the presidency			1
several justices have since said they were not eager to decide the matter and place themselves as competing political saviors or demons			0
read a transcript of monday 's health - care arguments here are some landmark , presidential election - year legal disputes -- judicial blockbusters if you will -- handled by the @entity3 : -- 1824 / @entity56 , striking down a @entity58 law granting a monopoly to a @entity61 ferry company			1
the court under chief justice @entity63 clarified the @entity64 , concluding state law conflicted with overriding congressional power to regulate interstate commerce			0
it is interpretation of that clause that is central to the current legal fight over health care expansion			0
-- 1856 / @entity73 , declaring @entity74 could not ban slavery in the territories and that blacks were barred from citizenship			1
the appeal was argued february 1856 , and a ruling came two days after president @entity82 's inauguration in march 1857			1
the new president in fact had asked the court to time its decision until after the election but before being sworn into office			1
he hoped that would defuse the slavery issue by putting it beyond political debate			0
and like others , the @entity93 hoped the court 's ruling would carry legitimacy among citizens in the @entity99 , an ultimately naive view			1
two families , two views on health care law historians also note the president - elect had quietly persuaded @entity107 justice @entity106 to change his vote and join the @entity110 majority in the @entity73 case , to give the impression the decision was not made along regional lines			1
this ruling is widely viewed as the court 's darkest moment , a sentiment expressed by most current members of the high court			1
-- 1896 / @entity121 , blessing the " separate but equal " state doctrine of racial segregation			0
by an 8 to 1 margin , the court upheld a @entity127 law requiring federal rail cars to provide different facilities for white and black passengers			0
the justices said that did not violate federal authority over interstate commerce , nor the 13th and 14th amendments			0
that precedent was overturned dramatically in the 1954 @entity137 series of appeals			0
-- 1908 / @entity139 v. @entity140 , allowing a state law limiting the working hours of women			0
attorney for the state @entity144 -- soon to join the court -- successfully argued that long , unregulated hours on the job affected the health and morals of employees , especially those in factories			2
a landmark decision affirming government control over the workplace			0
-- 1972 / @entity156 , invalidating all existing capital punishment laws			1
the 5 - 4 court said the death penalty was being applied unconstitutionally			2
@entity160 responded by revising their laws , leading the court four years later , in another presidential election year , to end its moratorium and allow states to resume executions			1
-- 1972 / @entity168 , legalizing abortion as a fundamental right of a woman 's " privacy " under the 14th amendment and concluding a fetus was not a " person " with constitutionally protected rights			1
the court tried to strike a balance between that individual right and states ' duty in limited regulation , for the sake of prenatal life and a woman 's health , a governmental interest that grows stronger as the pregnancy develops over time			2
the companion cases first came to the court in 1970 , and arguments were scheduled for 1971 , then postponed until spring 1972 , then reargued october 1972 , a month before the presidential elections			1
the landmark ruling came out january 1973 , just days after president @entity195 's inauguration			1
-- 2000 / @entity38 , ruling manual recounts of presidential ballots in @entity41 could not move ahead because of inconsistent evaluation standards in different counties			1
the court 's conservative majority cited the @entity202 of the @entity203 for its reasoning			1
stopping the tally meant @entity206 @entity42 , who was then narrowly leading in the decisive state , would become president , defeating vice president @entity209			1
-- 2008 / @entity210 , tossing out the @entity212 's strict ban on private handgun ownership			2
the conservative majority said citizens have a basic " individual " right to possess and keep guns in the home for self - defense			0
the court reaffirmed its holding two years later in a challenge to a similarly restrictive law from @entity223			0
a @entity1 guide to frequently asked questions sometimes the high court itself becomes the story			1
here are some presidential election years where the @entity3 as an institution or the justices became a major campaign issue : -- 1800 : jeffersonian @entity206 aimed criticism at the @entity236 - dominated high court over how much power the central government should hold			1
the tight election race -- called by some the " @entity240 " -- ushered in an era of @entity243 executive rule			2
new president @entity244 had campaigned on remaking the federal courts as well , but it was chief justice @entity63 , taking office two months before @entity244 , who succeeded on that front			0
through his 35 - year leadership on the bench , his federalist leanings helped strengthen the power of the @entity254 government in the face of state authority			1
-- 1860 : the infamous @entity73 decision shaped the debate of this election , indirectly helped put @entity260 in the @entity261 and carried the nation into its seemingly inevitable path to the @entity264			1
@entity260 had sharply criticized the @entity73 ruling in his stump speeches , and the new @entity206 's convention platform officially condemned it			1
-- 1876 : the 2000 election was not our first disputed one			2
in 1876 , democrat @entity271 won the popular vote in the presidential race , with @entity206 @entity274 also trailing in the initial electoral vote			0
republicans protested , and to resolve the dispute , @entity74 created a bipartisan commission that included five @entity3 justices			2
it was justice @entity281 who proved the swing vote , siding with @entity274 and giving the @entity206 a 185 - 184 electoral vote win			0
an insider 's guide : how the @entity3 works -- 1896 : the high court a year earlier had invalidated a nationwide federal income tax			1
liberals made that and other decisions considered " pro-business " a political rallying point			0
@entity294 campaigned against court " usurpation " of congressional reform efforts , a divisive political issue that would carry in into the 1930s			0
-- 1924 : the question here was a proposal by @entity304 candidate sen. @entity303 's ( who served @entity305 as a @entity206 ) for a " one - up " constitutional amendment			2
it would give @entity74 the power to overturn @entity3 decisions that overturned acts of @entity74			1
incumbent president @entity312 defended the federal courts , then dominated by conservative , as protectors of " our fundamental law			0
" -- 1936 : the fight between the courts and the other branches reached their zenith with the re-election efforts of president @entity322			2
he charged that the courts were undermining his sweeping economic reform programs during a national emergency , the @entity326			0
@entity322 was privately maneuvering for ways to go around the judiciary , including his audacious " court - packing plan " to expand the number of justices			2
that would allow the president to immediately name new , presumably more sympathetic , members to the court			0
the plan unveiled in 1937 ultimately failed , but the @entity93 's 12 - plus years in office did give him a chance to eventually appoint a record number of justices to that bench			0
-- 1968 : @entity206 candidate @entity195 made the court 's 15 - year record of " liberal " decisions under chief justice @entity345 a big " law and order " campaign theme			1
@entity195 said those rulings were " seriously hamstringing the peace forces in our society and strengthening the criminal forces			0
" @entity345 retired a year later , and @entity195 eventually named four justices to the high court			1
the subsequent appointments of @entity356 and @entity357 also helped move the federal judiciary to the right for decades .			0
