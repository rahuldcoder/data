@entity0 -- after the furor caused by a @entity7 magazine 's decision to publish topless photos of the @entity9 , she and prince @entity3 will be more than ready to get away from it all in the @entity11			1
as they arrive in the @entity0 on the next step of their @entity15 tour , " @entity3 " is the message the royal couple will see on huge billboards scattered across the capital , @entity21			1
and in a straw poll of residents , it 's clear the city is more than excited about the couple 's arrival on sunday			2
one man told me he will be heading to the airport early to catch a glimpse of them			0
he guessed half the population will turn out for the " once - in - a - lifetime " opportunity to see the @entity35 and @entity9			1
the couple are no doubt set for a big @entity11 welcome , involving not just big crowds but music and dancers			0
they will surely smile when they see their ground transport -- a pick - up truck dressed up as a canoe			0
@entity46 will pretend to row the couple into town			0
opinion : @entity51 privacy should start with @entity51 press later in the trip they will take to a real canoe , with rowers who will take them to a paradise island , accompanied by swimmers dressed as sharks			0
this leg of the tour will be full of photo opportunities -- but @entity9 and @entity3 may well have mixed views about that			1
the last leg to @entity67 was overshadowed by the @entity7 magazine closer 's decision to publish pictures of @entity9 sunbathing topless while on a private holiday with @entity3 in @entity7			1
she was upset , @entity3 is angry and they have both decided to take legal action against the publisher			2
but this is part of a bigger battle			0
they are trying to set a precedent ; drawing a line under what they see as creeping media intrusion			0
@entity3 is fiercely protective of his wife and he is determined to protect her from the fate of his mother , @entity89 , @entity89 , who was hounded by the paparazzi right up to the moment she died in @entity92			2
after @entity89 : how can intimate royal snaps be published in @entity7 ? what will hearten , and possibly surprise , @entity3 and @entity9 when they get here is that nobody is talking about the topless pictures			1
i ca n't see a mention of it in the papers and people seem much more interested in catching a glimpse of the couple and celebrating this moment when the @entity0 take a rare step into the global spotlight			2
it 's really only the media pack accompanying the tour that is discussing the photos -- because that 's what 's making the headlines in @entity116 , the @entity117 and @entity118			2
there is some apprehension among the accredited photographers that @entity9 and @entity3 will now become even more shy of the cameras , but the palace says the couple are determined to carry on with the tour as planned			1
they do n't want their trip to be ruined by the magazine scandal and it seems the islanders awaiting their arrival feel the same			0
the @entity35 and @entity9 look set to have some respite and some fun in the @entity0			1
but as this week has demonstrated , nothing about royal tours is predictable .			0

@entity3 and @entity137 are on a tour of *southeast* @entity15 nations
