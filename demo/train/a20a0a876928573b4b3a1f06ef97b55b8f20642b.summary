@entity0 -- @entity3 's former president @entity2 is back in @entity3 after years of self - imposed exile and is facing a hard time from courts in @entity3 amid a range of charges , including claims he illegally placed senior judges under house arrest during a period of emergency rule he imposed in 2007			1
likely to add to his charge sheet , @entity2 recently gave an interview to @entity1 's @entity17 when he admitted that he had given the @entity19 permission on a " very few " occasions to strike targets within @entity3			1
@entity2 , an army general who overthrew a democratically elected government during a 1999 coup , had previously remained silent about the strikes @entity25 carried out under his tenure			1
but @entity2 left power in 2008 , so why has he waited until now to speak ? one obvious reason is sheer self - interest			2
@entity2 returned to @entity3 last month after five years of self - imposed exile in @entity31 and @entity32			1
he did so under the false belief that he might still be popular among the people and that he might be able to reclaim power in the upcoming elections			0
but upon his arrival he found only hostility			0
@entity3 may not be happy with the way the country is being run now , but most do n't want to see the return of a dictator who brokered secret deals that resulted in the deaths of so many innocent @entity3			2
open hostility is not all @entity2 has faced , though			2
the @entity47 has ordered @entity2 to appear before them on charges of treason , a crime punishable by death in @entity3			1
several lower courts are also considering murder charges against @entity2 for his role in several killings , including that of several seminary students at @entity0 's @entity59 during a confrontation with security forces in 2007			1
the @entity47 has banned @entity2 from leaving the country and his name has been placed on an exit control list			2
he is currently under house arrest at his ranch compound outside the capital			0
@entity2 himself believes the claims are politically motivated			2
it is , therefore , no surprise that @entity2 has chosen now to speak out about @entity19 drone strikes			1
if he can appease the @entity74 again , perhaps the @entity19 administration will once again ride to his rescue			0
he has given president @entity77 's administration a much - needed headline of @entity3 support for @entity19 drone strikes			1
but the headline itself is misleading			0
first , @entity2 's statement involved only a limited number of strikes , those conducted during the administration of president @entity87			1
his consent does not extend beyond those strikes to cover those carried out under @entity77 , when the intensity of drone strikes escalated dramatically to form the bulk of all drone strikes			1
of the 367 drone strikes , only 52 were carried out before president @entity77 came into office , according to the @entity31 - based @entity98 ( @entity98 )			1
under the @entity77 administration , @entity3 's parliament , in two different sessions , has declared the strikes both illegal and counter-productive			1
unlike under @entity2 , the current parliament is democratically elected and speaks with the authority of the constitution behind it			0
there are also serious questions about whether @entity2 's consent was even valid for the few he supposedly approved			1
any consent would have to comply with @entity3 's constitutional laws			1
the @entity113 in the @entity3 city of @entity115 considered this question recently			2
during his oral arguments , the chief justice made it clear that the @entity3 constitution protects its citizens ' right to life and that no political leader can consent to an abrogation of that right without due process			2
the reality is drones -- with or without consent -- are a seductive option for the leader of the free world			0
it is good politics to keep @entity74 " safe " by engaging in a war that only lines up body bags on the other side			0
in this war , the human losses that normally bring an end to war -- like those in @entity143 -- do n't exist			0
even more seductive is the ability to wage war without oversight			0
for years , the @entity148 has refused to tell anyone who it may be killing			0
we 're supposed to have faith in the @entity148 's good nature and their claims that they are only killing bad guys			0
in fact the claim drone strikes are killing only @entity158 simply is not true -- i personally represent more than 100 civilian victims of strikes and they are absolutely not militants			1
according to nonpartisan public policy group , the @entity164 , drones strikes have killed at least 1,990 @entity3 , including hundreds of civilians			2
@entity77 campaigned and was elected on a platform of change , one that would end the abuses and torture so prevalent during the early years of the so - called war on terror			0
more than four years later , the " change " @entity77 has brought to @entity3 through drones has resulted in more needless deaths , daily suicide attacks , and growing instability			0
for the average @entity3 , whether a murderous , corrupt dictator consented to this brand of change is irrelevant			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity3 's former president @entity2 recently returned from exile
@entity19 given permission to launch drone strikes on ' very few ' occasions
@entity185 : @entity2 will be looking to win support from @entity25 once more
but the former military chief is *barred* from standing in may 11 election
