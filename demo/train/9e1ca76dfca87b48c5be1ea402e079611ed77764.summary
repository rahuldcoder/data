-- despite his threats of " consequences " and the subsequent beatings and shooting deaths by government agents , the open protests on @entity9 's streets by hundreds of thousands of people have dented the shield of invincibility of @entity9 's @entity14 religious leader , ayatollah @entity13 , say sources in @entity9			1
riot police patrol a @entity18 street earlier this week			2
chants of " death to @entity13 " broke a state - imposed , and a self - imposed absolute prohibition on criticizing a leader believed to be wielding the wisdom and authority of @entity26 himself			1
but right now , the massive network of @entity9 's intelligence agents , @entity30 , paramilitary @entity31 , and police of all sorts , are cracking down			1
sources say they are also going house to house , through email accounts and web postings , through cell phone calls and @entity42 text messages ( when the system is allowed to stay up ) and even to taxi agencies whose drivers hoisted @entity47 posters during the election campaign			1
they are rounding people up and , as it was chillingly put to me , in @entity9 's prisons " we have room for all of them			1
" in addition protestors are being paraded " confessing and repenting " on @entity9 state tv			1
the government also claims to be arresting " foreign agents " accused of stirring up the protests			2
sources say the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , aligned with @entity13 , plucked @entity61 from total obscurity as presidential candidate in 2005 , in order to hold the line against " reform " in the country after eight years of the reformist president @entity68			1
sources in the @entity9 government and well - placed analysts inside the country say the @entity30 has taken up influential positions in many major sectors of @entity9 society , such as the oil industry , finance , transport , construction and other businesses and politics			1
@entity9 has been " increasingly radicalized over the last four years , " one told me			2
while there are divisions within the clerical establishment and in parliament , sources tell me that for now that does not threaten the ruling establishment			2
i was told the weekend arrests of former president @entity92 's daughter and other relatives , and their swift release , were a warning to @entity92 , who backed @entity47 in the election			2
so far the powerful mullahs , monitoring it all from the holy city of @entity100 , are mostly quiet			0
and finally , for now , while @entity47 has startled the system with his willingness to press the election case , he is also considered , at this moment , no @entity105			0
nowhere near as charismatic and powerful as the leader of the successful revolution in 1979			0
sources say @entity47 is not formally arrested or under house arrest			0
however his movements and words are " controlled " by security and intelligence officials			1
so in effect there is no visible leader for the street protesters today -- unlike 1979 , when @entity105 led from exile			0
sources say all this could change if mass demonstrations hit the streets and simply remain there all over the country , if the security forces refuse to expand the crackdown , or if people go on nationwide strike , like they did in 1978 - 79			1
as long as the streets and squares remain blanketed by security , they are mostly clear of protesters			0
right now , chants of @entity134 still resound from the rooftops at night			0
although residents say they seem to be dying down in some neighborhoods			0
even the honking horns and flashing headlights are fading from the traffic			0
at this moment , however , it is impossible to know how this contest of wills -- and powers -- will play out .			0

@entity146 : @entity13 's *credibility* dented by huge street protests in @entity9
sources say security forces are monitoring *activists* ' emails , *sms* messages
@entity9 : intelligence officials could lose their control in face of mass protests
