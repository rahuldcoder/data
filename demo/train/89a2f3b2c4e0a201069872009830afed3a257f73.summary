-- at this point , @entity1 has built an entire subgenre of movies in which he sticks his tongue out at his cinematic legacy			1
after inventing our modern idea of a wiseguy in films like " @entity12 " and " @entity13 , " the actor has spent much of the last 20 years lampooning it in farces like the funny " @entity17 " ( and its disappointing sequel " analyze that " ) and the very funny " @entity19 " ( and its very disappointing sequels " @entity20 " and " @entity22 " )			0
the results have been mixed , but @entity1 's star has n't faded — maybe because the line between those movies and his more serious work ( eg , " @entity28 " ) has remained so clear			1
but the new comedy - thriller " @entity31 , " directed and co-written by @entity32 ( " @entity33 " ) , does n't just wink at @entity1 's history , it leans on it , hard			1
the actor might as well be playing an older version of his @entity39 - era persona as @entity40 , a former mob boss who snitched and now has to hide in the @entity41 in northern @entity42			2
with a grizzled @entity45 agent ( @entity44 ) as a guardian angel , the @entity40 family members all try to act as humdrum as possible to avoid attention			2
@entity40 pretends to be an author at work on a @entity51 book			0
his tough - as - nails wife ( @entity52 ) plays hausfrau , his hot - tempered daughter ( " @entity55 's " @entity54 ) flirts with her math tutor , and his whip smart son ( @entity57 ) makes allies at school			2
these fish - out - of - water b - plots mostly look for laughs in the @entity40 family 's inverted , @entity64 morality			1
to them , crime is good , normal people are boring , and a brutal beating is a perfectly acceptable solution to mundane problems like a stolen pencil case or a rude plumber			0
sometimes it works , especially in @entity52 's scenes , where she shows off a darkly comic edge that has n't had this much of a showcase since the last time she played a wiseguy 's wife in 1988 's " @entity81			0
" yet the movie 's violence level is so strangely high that it jars the comedy			2
there 's only so long you can laugh at a person getting savagely pummeled before you start imagining how much it would hurt			0
" @entity31 " also does n't have any real twists in store beyond its basic setup			0
you know that @entity40 's past — in the form of bounty - hunting hitmen — will catch up to him			0
and it does , turning the third act into a generic thriller with a weirdly high body count			0
before that , though , there are some memorable scenes , including one wry meta - moment in which the movie outright acknowledges the fact that @entity1 himself is playing @entity40			1
it 'll probably make you laugh — and wonder if the movie is about to head in a much smarter , kookier direction			0
) but mostly it makes you wish that you were watching @entity1 add to his movie legacy instead of scrapping it for gags			1
