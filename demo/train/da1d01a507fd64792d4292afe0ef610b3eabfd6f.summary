-- dogs and cats soothe the soul and provide companionship , but a report released this week suggests they sometimes cause broken bones and sprains , too			1
most data on human - pet relationships have been devoted to the health benefits , such as lower blood pressure			0
the @entity12 estimates that every year , more than 86,000 fall injuries are caused by pets			1
dogs are the biggest culprits , causing 88 percent of the injuries			1
cats cause 11.7 percent of the falls , according to the @entity20			1
@entity12 researchers formulated the national estimates based on data from 66 emergency rooms			1
" many of them occurred while people were walking their dog or chasing either their dog or cat , " said @entity25 , an epidemiologist with the @entity12 's @entity26			1
" over half the injuries with dogs were either falls or tripping over the pet or they were pushed or pulled by the pet			1
" pets can suddenly rush to the door or scurry around the owners ' feet , causing these accidents , experts said			1
at least once a week , a patient injured by an overexcited dog or an unexpected chew toy walks into the office of dr. @entity48 , an orthopedic surgeon and chief of hand surgery at the @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53			2
these patients often have wrist fractures after falling on an outstretched hand			0
" it 's a common scenario , " said @entity48 , who is also a spokesman for the @entity57			0
" @entity60 trip over their pet or the pet , usually a dog , has a leash that pulls them down			2
while there 's incredible incidence of falls in the elderly , people of all ages fall			1
" the @entity12 report did not determine whether individuals have died from pet - related falls , although @entity25 said it was highly unlikely			1
pet - related tumbles amount to about 1 percent of the total injuries caused by falls in the @entity78			1
@entity79 , professor in the @entity80 at @entity81 , said dogs and cats tend to walk near people 's feet			1
" they 're small , most of them , " she said			0
" you walk along and they want to go one way all of a sudden			0
they 're right in front of you or they want to rush to the door			0
" psychologist and dog trainer dr. @entity96 said if people are tripping over dogs , they 're " the ones that need to get newspaper and hit themselves for not teaching the dog ; " he recommended taking every dog to obedience training			1
" my opinion is that dogs are a lot happier and a lot more secure when they know what their handlers want , " he said			2
" the relationship is stronger when the dog knows what he needs to get treats and has lot more freedom			2
" the @entity12 estimates about 9 percent of the falls are related to tripping over a toy or food bowl			1
" it 's not just the animals , but their toys , " @entity119 said			0
" we have little balls and stuff all over the floor			0
those are easy to trip over , especially at night			0
you need to have a dog basket to put the toys in or turn on the light before you go walking in the night			2
" much of the research pertaining to people and their relationship with pets has been devoted to the health benefits , such as how animals help relieve stress and lower blood pressure			2
not much data has been collected on pet - caused falls			1
@entity25 , a fall expert , said she was frequently asked at medical conferences whether pets were fall hazards and so began examining that aspect of injury			1
in 2004 , researchers at the @entity148 in @entity149 reported on 16 patients between the ages of 75 and 88 who suffered major fractures in pet - related falls			1
once again , dogs were the main culprit			2
but birds , a donkey and a goat made the list of animal suspects			2
the @entity149 researchers , in their report titled " the perils of pet ownership " found there were no deaths resulting from fall - related fractures , although one cat died when its owner fell and landed on it			2
in the @entity78 cases , 90 percent of the pet - related falls were treated in emergency departments			1
about 9 percent of those injured were hospitalized			2
most of those hospitalized were elderly			0
older people 's bones are more brittle and easier to break			0
this could increase the incidence of hip fracture , which requires an operation , @entity48 said			0
but it 's not only the elderly who are affected			0
several athletes have been dogged by the consequences of a human - canine collision			0
in september , an @entity190 soccer player , @entity189 , was sidelined with an ankle injury after tripping over his @entity192 on the stairs , according to @entity195 media reports			0
@entity197 tennis star @entity196 bruised her tailbone after falling over @entity199 , her @entity200 , in 2006			0
several @entity202 cyclists have crashed into dogs that trotted onto their path during the race			2
sometimes the culprit is not the actual animal , but its byproduct			0
@entity190 soccer player @entity209 slipped on a puddle of urine from his puppy , @entity213 , and suffered a knee injury in 1999			0
medical and veterinary experts had this advice for avoiding pet collisions : put your animal in another room or different area of the house before carrying groceries or heavy things into the house			1
this will protect both the animal and human , so the dog or cat wo n't knock you off balance , and you will avoid stepping on an animal while distracted			1
keep stairs and hallways clear of clutter			0
if you get up frequently in the dark , use night - lights so your path is lighted and you can see your pet			0
also consider removing the animal from the bedroom to prevent stepping on it .			0

every year , more than 86,000 fall injuries are caused by pets .
