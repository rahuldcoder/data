-- the recent climate summit in @entity2 , @entity3 , has laid the foundations for a new climate treaty to be adopted in @entity6 in 2015			1
we have made significant progress toward an agreement that for the first time will involve all countries in serious efforts to combat climate change			1
the compromise reached in @entity2 ensures that all opportunities are open for negotiations to be successful over the coming year			1
this progress is welcome because ultimately , taking action on the climate is both a moral issue and the key to our well - being			1
indeed , in recognition of the importance of tackling climate change , @entity23 earlier this month adopted a package of measures that will considerably bolster our efforts			1
the package we passed provides the instruments we need to achieve our goal of cutting emissions by 40 % by 2020 compared with 1990 levels			1
it includes additional measures for all relevant sectors -- from energy generation , transportation and agriculture to insulating buildings			2
once , such changes might have sparked widespread concern that we would somehow be hampering our competitiveness			2
yet the @entity47 has been able to banish the myth that ambitious climate action is detrimental to the economy			1
between 1990 and 2012 , for example , greenhouse gas emissions in the @entity47 fell by 18 % , while the overall economy grew by around 45 %			1
the reality is that greater prosperity does n't have to mean more greenhouse gas emissions , poorer environmental protection or higher resource consumption			1
in fact , in the future , the opposite will surely prove to be true : only those economies that take the @entity64 's planetary boundaries seriously will be able to achieve sustained success			0
of course , doubts remain			0
yet 15 years after we launched our " @entity68 " -- the move away from an energy supply based on fossil and nuclear fuels -- the economic impact has been broadly extremely positive : renewable energy sources now account for nearly 30 % of our electricity demands , and by 2050 , our energy supply will be based almost completely on renewable sources			0
indeed , the boom in environmental technologies is one of the reasons @entity23 made it through the economic crisis relatively unscathed			2
there are now over 1.5 million people working in this sector			0
technologies such as photovoltaics are now commercially viable despite the doubts about their economic benefits only 10 years ago			0
meanwhile , money that would otherwise have been needed to import expensive fossil resources now instead goes to individuals , cooperatives , farmers , and small and medium - sized enterprises , that can all themselves become energy suppliers			0
the second pillar of our climate policy is energy efficiency			1
in a world where political tensions are mounting even as the hunger for natural resources grows , efficient production is becoming the deciding factor for a country 's competitiveness			0
with this in mind , @entity23 supports companies that optimize their refrigeration facilities , for example , or that use heat - power co-generation			2
but even as we improve the standards for new construction , we also have to face the challenge of the considerable existing stock of public and private buildings			0
our goal is to ensure that these buildings are climate - neutral by 2050 , and we have allocated significant state funding to stimulate private investment in improving the energy efficiency of our buildings			2
scientists have long agreed that climate action strengthens economic development and creates an opportunity for comprehensive modernization of our economies			2
the age of fossil fuel is coming to an end , just as the age of the horse and cart , the steam locomotive and the oil lamp eventually came to an end			0
but to hasten this end , we must invest in our future			0
scientists estimate that more than $ 90 trillion will need to be invested globally in public infrastructure and energy systems over the next 15 years			0
agreements like the one in @entity2 will encourage greater certainty in green investment , but that deal is not the end , merely the latest part of an ongoing , global change that we need to promote			1
we are pleased that the @entity159 , with recent announcements by president @entity158 , is also willing to contribute to this change , thus testifying to the country 's continuing ability to modernize itself while retaining its traditional values			1
back in september , while world leaders were preparing to attend the annual @entity169 meetings , demonstrators came together in @entity170 to demand that we take climate change seriously			1
it was an inspiring scene , one that i hope all leaders took to heart			0
these demonstrators in @entity170 called for us to act now , not tomorrow			0
let us do just that .			0

@entity179 : @entity2 climate talks marked significant progress
tackling climate change does n't have to hurt economy , she writes
@entity23 has passed measures to cut emissions *dramatically* by 2020
