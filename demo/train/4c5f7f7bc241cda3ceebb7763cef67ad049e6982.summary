this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 @entity13 , @entity14 : hi ! i 'm @entity16 , welcoming you back to another summer edition of @entity0			1
got something really cool for you this week			1
we 're talking about @entity12			1
this is a program that just wrapped up			1
it 's a partnership between a group called @entity26 and the staff of @entity0 and @entity28 ; and what it does is bring about 75 of @entity5 's brightest high school students to the @entity33 campus , where they spend a week learning about everything from journalism to , of course , leadership skills			1
@entity38 , @entity40 assistant director : that 's our goal , is to help them become more comfortable as leaders			2
you can tell as the week progresses they have come out of their shells , they have taken some risks and learned to work with people who are very different from them			1
@entity52 : i had the honor and privilege of kicking things off			2
i talked a little bit about how i got to where i am , what we do at @entity0 , and some students then talked to us about their first impressions as the week started			1
@entity62 , senior : i think that what stood out most to me was the fact that we got the chance to meet so many unique people and so many different genres of @entity0			1
@entity70 , senior : being able to sit down and talk to professionals one - on - one and ask them the most important questions			1
@entity75 , senior : what stood out to me the most was @entity16			2
i love how he asked questions and actually got the audience involved in us as students			1
he actually cared about our answers and cared to have a conversation with normal high school students			1
@entity52 : as things got rolling , students learned about many different facets of media			1
we talked to them about some of the new technologies available to us			2
we talked about how social networking gets used in newscasts			2
these were their impressions of that			2
@entity99 , senior : i learned a lot about how you have to balance between the social media and what actual news is			2
it 's a big question as to which one comes first : determining what your audience wants to hear and what they need to hear			2
@entity113 , senior : this panel showed me just how much social media influences the way news gets around the world , especially in areas that do n't allow @entity0 to have cameras on the ground			1
it 's truly essential in making accurate news reporting			2
@entity125 , senior : i learned that @entity0 uses @entity127 a lot			1
you hear a lot about younger generations using @entity132 , but @entity127 is pretty well known and well used at @entity0			1
@entity52 : a big highlight of this conference happened right here at the @entity136 in @entity4 , @entity5			1
students got to listen to a dinner panel of @entity0 talent and executives , and they heard a few things about work and life			1
@entity144 , junior : something i really learned is that the friends you get here are the friends that you will need in life			0
@entity153 , junior : definitely that just be yourself and you can be whoever you want to be , and you can do whatever you want to do			0
just follow your dreams and pursue yourself			0
@entity158 , junior : keep working at it			0
if you want to work in video broadcasting , you have to start low and work your way up			0
@entity162 , junior : you have to have your hook and the one thing that sets yourself apart from everybody else , and make yourself the one that is remembered			0
@entity169 @entity170 , @entity14 : time for the shoutout ! who is credited with saying , " leadership and learning are indispensable to each other " ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity182 , b ) @entity183 , c ) @entity185 or @entity186 ) @entity181 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! that quote about leadership comes from former @entity189 president @entity183			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity12 @entity52 : of course , the name of the program : leadership unplugged			1
a big focus is learning what it takes to be a leader			0
here 's what students said about that in their own words			1
@entity205 , graduated as a junior : you have to be able to connect with all different kinds of people			0
and not everyone 's going to like you ; you 're not going to like everyone			0
but if you have the ability to communicate and cooperate , then you can lead			0
@entity213 , junior : i think leadership is the ability to stand out above other people and give them a sense of belonging			0
as a leader , i do n't think that you 're able to have everyone like you			0
@entity221 , junior : if you want to be exceptional and create something and be really successful , you really need to persevere as a leader			0
and know that even though you might be going through tough times , in the end , true leaders do what it takes to be successful			0
@entity52 : this was the 6th year for @entity12 , but this was the first year that some of the students actually got to go on the air live on a @entity0 network			1
a few of the students were interviewed by @entity237 , an anchor with @entity0 en @entity238			1
@entity239 , senior : he just asked us about how we liked it and everyone was a little nervous			0
he said it was good			0
the captions were really funny because it said , you know , " young leaders changing the world			1
" and we 're like , " oh my @entity251 ! " but if you think about it , we are , because we 're making a difference			0
winners @entity52 : these 75 students were divided into groups and they were given a project to work on throughout the week			1
that project was to pitch a story to a panel of @entity0 executives , so a little bit intimidating there			1
but they were scored on their pitch , and they were scored on things like the presentation itself , how creative the story was , how balanced the story was			0
and the winning pitch was a story about illegal immigration in the @entity189			0
some members of that winning group talked to us about what it was like to win			0
@entity281 , junior : i was actually afraid that we had n't won , but when they called our name , i just knew we had it			2
@entity287 , senior : yeah , i was really excited			0
but i knew that , like , deep down , that we might have a chance because of our title			0
our title was really powerful : " undocumented and @entity292			0
" it gave me a little hope there			0
goodbye @entity52 : so , that was how the week wrapped up , and that is how we wrap up this special summer edition of @entity0			1
we hope to lead you back to @entity301 , and that you 'll plug in for more stories right here throughout the summer			2
hope to see you soon			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity16 .			1

@entity0 is producing special , web - only shows all summer long
this week , we *explore* a week - long conference called @entity12
the program introduces high school students to the world of journalism
