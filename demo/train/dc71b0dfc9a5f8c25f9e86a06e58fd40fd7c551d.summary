@entity0 -- as the administration considers what executive actions president @entity4 can take on immigration , the central question is how far can he go ? @entity4 said on june 30 that he had asked the attorney general and the secretary of @entity9 to look into the steps he can take , within the confines of the @entity12 , to " fix as much of our immigration system as i can on my own			1
" the president expects to receive their recommendations before the end of the summer and intends to adopt them without delay			0
he said he was taking this step because @entity21 -- particularly @entity23 republicans -- had not acted on comprehensive immigration reform			1
at a news conference on wednesday , @entity4 said the @entity27 people want to see action on the issue			1
" what i can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress , " he said			0
" and we 're going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power			2
but i promise you the @entity27 people do n't want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for @entity21 to get something done			1
" advocates and analysts say the legal answer might be different than the political one			1
what 's being considered at the top of the list of options is an expansion of the @entity52 program			0
it allows immigrants brought here illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation and apply for work permits if they meet certain criteria			1
so far , some 660,000 young people have taken advantage of the program , according to a report by the nonpartisan @entity64			0
that 's 55 % of the 1.2 million who were immediately eligible			0
half a dozen advocates involved in conversations with @entity23 and @entity9 officials studying the matter believe the president could expand deportation relief to potentially millions more undocumented immigrants by expanding @entity52			1
@entity74 - led @entity23 authorizes lawsuit against @entity4 advocates say the administration is considering expanding @entity52 to cover the parents of @entity27 citizens or all undocumented parents			1
the @entity23 could also decide to cover undocumented immigrants in industries such as farming , or it could expand relief based on how long a person has been living and working in the community			1
while there are many different mechanisms that could be used to provide deportation relief , using the existing @entity52 program as the template is an attractive alternative because that process has been up and running since 2012			2
" we think the administration should be looking at the most expansive relief that 's possible given that we 're talking about people who have very strong ties to the community and they are woven into these communities and they have really strong equities , " said @entity94 , the legislative analyst for the @entity96 at the @entity97			0
several groups are pushing the president to expand the @entity52 program for all those who would have been allowed to stay under the comprehensive immigration overhaul legislation the @entity111 passed in june 2013 but stalled in the @entity23			1
that would mean an estimated 6 million to 9 million people could qualify , advocates say			2
" he could protect 9 million people in the estimation of our legal beagles who 've looked at this , " said @entity115 , executive director of @entity116			2
@entity115 was one of several advocates who attended a meeting with @entity4 on june 30			1
he said the president appeared ready to take bold , aggressive action on the issue			0
legal considerations groups such as @entity116 , backed by legal experts , say the president is on solid legal ground to expand @entity52 , even to the millions that would have qualified for relief under the @entity111 bill			2
they say that 's because deferred action -- a type of prosecutorial discretion that grants some undocumented immigrants relief from deportation on a case - by - case basis -- is a well - established practice under existing immigration law			1
" he has the authority to decide who to prosecute , " said @entity146 , immigration policy and strategy director at the @entity149			2
" as long as he is following the laws that @entity21 has passed , he has broad discretion in terms of how to do that			1
" with @entity21 divided , @entity4 to go his own way on immigration @entity159 , an immigration law professor at @entity160 and author of the new book " @entity162 , " said there are legal limits on the president 's authority over immigration law			1
for instance , he ca n't change the rules for noncitizens to become permanent residents or put them on a path to citizenship because @entity21 sets those rules			1
but he said none of these limits stands in the way of expanding @entity52 as long as it 's done correctly			0
setting priorities about who to deport , such as focusing on violent criminals , is necessary because @entity21 does not appropriate enough money to deport all of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country , advocates say			1
" @entity21 created a system that has resulted in 11 million [ people ] in the @entity27 without legal status , " @entity159 said			1
" handed this situation , it 's unavoidable that the president exercises discretionary choices about enforcement			0
in doing so , he is on solid ground using a @entity52 - like approach for a larger group , making case - by - case individual decisions after a group of people qualifies under threshold criteria			0
" @entity204 , a former commissioner of the @entity205 now at the @entity64 , said it 's theoretically true that the administration could expand @entity52 to cover as many people as would have been covered in the @entity111 bill			2
but he said there are a lot of other issues the administration 's lawyers have to consider when deciding just how much to expand the program			1
those include how likely it is that they would be sued by opponents and whether those opponents would have standing to argue they were harmed			0
another big question the @entity23 must consider is what kind of precedent a big , bold move could set not just for future undocumented immigrants but for the exercise of executive power on other issues such as environmental policy and enforcement of civil rights laws			1
" there 's just an enormous amount of jurisprudence and legal analysis that lawyers are going to bring to help inform the decisions on this issue because it is very high stakes , " @entity204 said			2
" one always is concerned in the executive branch about the precedent that gets set where your successors are concerned			2
depending on where you are politically , what may seem like a gift in the hands of the opposing party becomes a hammer			0
" political considerations another big question is how much of a political backlash the @entity23 is willing to endure			2
" many groups , including ours , have said , ' you know , it would really be awesome to use that [ @entity111 bill ] as a template , ' " @entity115 said			0
" most of us think he 's not gon na go that far , not because of a lack of legal authority , but because the political constraints are bigger than the legal limitations			2
" many @entity266 , led by members from the @entity268 , have long pushed for the president to use his powers to curb deportations			2
" he has alternatives under existing law , " rep. @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity275 chairman , said on the @entity23 floor earlier this year			0
" there are concrete ways within existing law to help keep families together and spare @entity27 citizens from losing their wives , their husbands and their children to deportation			0
in spite of your lack of action			0
" @entity4 impeachment talk just political theater but the @entity23 has already gotten a sampling of the kind of response any announcement of executive actions on immigration is likely to get from @entity74 in @entity21			1
house speaker @entity299 said the president 's moves would create incentive for more illegal crossings and would be a " grave mistake			0
" " if the president takes these actions , he 'll be sealing the deal on his legacy -- legacy of lawlessness , " @entity299 said in july			0
" he 'll be violating the solemn oath he made to the @entity27 people on the day of his inauguration and he 'll be sacrificing the integrity of our laws on the altar of political opportunism and i can guarantee you , the @entity27 people will hold him accountable			0
" @entity323 , many of whom have accused @entity4 of being an imperial president , have already voted to sue the president , charging he overstepped his authority in implementing the @entity328			1
and it is n't just republicans who are questioning the president 's plan			0
an august 6 @entity334 editorial also weighed in			0
" @entity335 , hopelessly partisan and incapable of problem - solving , @entity21 is a mess			1
but that does n't grant the president license to tear up the @entity12 , " the paper 's editorial board wrote			0
" as mr. @entity4 himself said last fall : ' if , in fact , i could solve all these problems without passing laws in @entity21 , then i would do so			1
but we 're also a nation of laws			0
' to act on his own , the president said , would violate those laws			0
" the paper predicted that extending deportation relief to millions of undocumented immigrants could trigger a constitutional showdown with congressional @entity74 .			1

after @entity21 failed to act , @entity4 is considering executive actions on immigration issues
@entity4 could expand deferrals to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation
immigration advocates are pushing @entity4 to act broadly to bring down deportations
but the questions are what can @entity4 do legally and does he have the political capital ?
