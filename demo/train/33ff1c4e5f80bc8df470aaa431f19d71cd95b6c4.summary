@entity0 is out of answers			2
standing outside a corner market in crime - ridden @entity3 , she throws her arms up in desperation			1
" i 've been here for 13 years and i have watched the crime escalate , i have watched the neighborhood deteriorate			1
i have watched the police presence decline here			2
i do n't know what the answer is , " said @entity10 , executive director of @entity11			2
behind her , stuffed teddy bears , balloons and flowers mark the spot where the store 's clerk , @entity19 , was gunned down on january 23 because , police say , she witnessed a murder at the same spot the day after @entity24			1
" this is a vicious cycle , " @entity10 said			2
out of the nation 's 10 largest cities , @entity3 's homicide rate is the worst			1
last year ended with 324 homicides , up from 306 in 2010			1
and just one month into this year , there has been on average more than one homicide each day in @entity3 , with many of the 34 deaths unfolding like episodes on " @entity35			1
" a man ambushed a car packed with teens -- killing three of them -- for feuding with his stepsons			2
a pizza delivery man was shot in the back during a robbery			2
another man was beaten to death hailing a cab on a busy downtown street			2
then there was the retribution killing of @entity51 , the store clerk and alleged murder witness			2
aside from the murders , there have been ruthless beatings			2
on january 2 , an off - duty police officer and @entity58 war veteran was punched and kicked until he was unconscious outside a landmark restaurant after the @entity61 hockey game			1
a couple of weeks later , a 64 - year - old @entity63 veteran on his way to meet his wife at the bus stop was attacked and robbed by two teens			2
" i think folks are desperate			2
i think they 're desperate and come from a culture where they learn the way to handle an argument is with a gun , " said @entity70 , director of the @entity71 of school - aged violence at @entity73			2
@entity70 , an education professor at @entity73 , works with educators and youth to prevent school fights , shootings and cyberbullying			2
" although the streets do n't offer anything positive , to a lot of the young people , a lot of the boys , the young black men , ( the streets are ) consistent , " he said			2
" they know where they stand ( on the streets )			2
" @entity3 's mayor has made it clear the city is waging an all - out war against violent criminals			1
" if you want to act like an idiot , if you want to be an a-hole , if you want to be a low - life in this town , we will track you down like the dog that you are , " mayor @entity102 told @entity104 affiliate @entity103 last month			1
at the end of january , city officials unveiled new crimefighting measures , including a reward of $ 20,000 for information solving a homicide and $ 500 for locating illegal guns , plus funding for the witness assistance program and increasing police presence			1
at the news conference announcing the measures , @entity102 put it this way : " to every criminal out there : i just put a $ 20,000 bounty on your head			2
" a violent trend city officials say it 's too early to determine whether @entity3 's homicide rate will continue to rise this year			1
last year , as the city was besieged by teen mob attacks , @entity102 made it clear he would not tolerate the violence			0
he raised some eyebrows last summer when he took to the pulpit to call out the predominantly black youths involved in the attacks			0
" you damage yourself , you damage another person , you damage your peers , and quite honestly , you damage your own race , " said @entity102 , who is black and has two children			0
in an attempt to stop the mob violence , @entity102 moved up the weekend curfews for teens in two @entity3 neighborhoods that bore the brunt of the seemingly random attacks			1
" there is no excuse for young people being out so late at night by themselves and then making bad decisions and literally assaulting other citizens , " @entity102 said			0
" i will not tolerate that			0
" @entity3 may have the worst homicide rate of the country 's most populated cities , according to the most recent complete data ( see fact box on left ) , but it pales in comparison with less - populated @entity169 cities			1
based on statistics from 2010 , @entity3 's homicide rate is about 20 killings per 100,000 people , according to @entity175 statistics			1
by comparison , cities with smaller populations have murder rates far worse than @entity3 , including @entity179 at 49.1 , @entity180 at 40.5 and @entity181 at 34.8			1
criminal justice professor @entity182 says it 's important to put @entity3 's homicide data into a broader perspective			1
" nobody likes to have these homicide statistics , " said @entity182 , director of the @entity186 at @entity187			1
" you 're talking about 34 homicides			1
that 's in a city of 1.5 million people			0
" while the daily body count is a disturbing trend for the city and triggers rampant media coverage , it does n't mean @entity3 is on track to become the murder capital of the country , @entity182 said			1
" i do n't want to belittle the numbers , but it 's really too difficult to assess the safety of the entire city based on little over a month of data , " he said			0
" the real test will be this spring or summer when we ( normally ) see the violence peak			0
" sending a message this year , most of the city 's homicides have been confined to @entity3 , including the @entity216 neighborhood , where @entity51 was gunned down inside her store and where @entity0 's nonprofit victims ' support unit operates			1
she said violence is now part of the fabric of the neighborhood and is as commonplace as a passing city bus			0
" they 're committing crimes in broad daylight			1
these crimes are heinous because they put the fear of @entity231 in these communities , " she said			1
" this homicide sent a strong message in this community			1
if you see something , do n't say anything , because this could be you			0
" @entity10 said her @entity11 has helped more than 420 victims of violent crime since november , with several free services including court accompaniment and crime victim 's compensation assistance , as well as short - and long - term counseling to victims of violent crimes ranging from shootings to rape			1
@entity10 's building , a renovated former drug house now riddled with bullet holes , is one block away from the @entity255 where @entity51 was killed			0
it also sits around the corner from where the infamous " @entity216 , " responsible for at least three homicides , was apprehended last year			1
@entity10 said she believes the situation in @entity216 has worsened after a nearby police precinct closed in recent years			1
" some days , i 'm afraid , " she said			0
" but if all of the social services ran out of this community out of fear , who would be here ? " ' there 's still killing every day ' the city 's daily violence has news outlets once again branding the city " @entity273			0
" public safety advocate @entity274 said the moniker is unfair			1
he urged critics to " look beyond the body count			0
" " we are n't all going out shooting each other randomly			0
things have happened , yes			0
there 's a challenge , yes			0
but kill - adelphia ? no. should you be afraid to be in @entity3 ? no , " said @entity274 , executive director for @entity283 , an organization of volunteers who patrol neighborhoods			1
" police ca n't do everything			0
we have a responsibility to address the challenges in our community			0
" that responsibility , @entity274 said , starts with establishing a positive foundation for youth , particularly when it comes to conflict resolution			0
arguments are the leading motive for murder , and blacks make up nearly 84 % of the homicide victims , according to police data			1
stopping arguments from escalating to deadly violence is a priority at @entity307			0
" @entity311 ( is ) a key portion of what we 're doing , " said @entity308 , @entity102 's chief of staff and deputy mayor for public safety			1
" but also just getting the community to act as one and come forward and say ' enough is enough			0
this stuff has got to stop			0
' " back in @entity3 , the gifts left behind in memory of @entity51 join the collection of memorials honoring shooting victims across the neighborhood			1
at a recent prayer vigil , @entity324 released a dole of doves in memory of the slain store clerk , whom she knew from her regular visits to the corner store			0
" she was a really nice lady , very respectable , " she said			0
" i 'm really in shock still that this has happened to her			0
" @entity324 is no stranger to violence			0
her 5 - year - old daughter , @entity338 , was abducted , sexually assaulted , strangled and later found in an apartment building a block from her home in @entity3			1
the alleged killer is one of the @entity175 's 10 most wanted fugitives			0
she said that while justice was served for @entity51 through arrests for her slaying , she believes more needs to be done to stop the killing			0
" i 'm really disgusted with how every day you hear about a shooting , every day you hear somebody getting killed , every day something going on , " @entity324 said			0
" one death is too many , but a thousand of them is never enough ( to have any effect )			0
there 's still killing every day			0

this january , there were 34 homicides in @entity3
in past years , it had the *highest* homicide rate of all big @entity169 cities
victims ' advocate says many crimes committed in " broad daylight "
@entity370 mayor has warned criminals , " we will track you down like the dog that you are "
