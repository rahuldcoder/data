he 's one of the best basketball players in the country , and he led his team to victory in monday night 's @entity6 championship game			2
but the @entity8 's @entity7 recently told reporters he sometimes goes to bed " starving " because he ca n't afford food , despite that @entity8 's student - athlete guidelines include provisions for meal plans			1
the remark got the attention of state lawmakers in @entity18 , who are now exploring legislative ways to allow athletes at @entity8 , a state institution , to unionize -- much like athletes are attempting at @entity22			1
rep. @entity23 said he and other state lawmakers are considering legislation			0
unlike at @entity22 , a private institution governed by the @entity27 , @entity18 law governs whether employees at a public institution can unionize			2
" he says he 's going to bed hungry at a time when millions of dollars are being made off of him			2
it 's obscene , " @entity23 said			0
" this is n't a @entity18 problem			0
this is an @entity6 problem , and i want to make sure we 're putting pressure on them to treat athletes well			0
" @entity7 recently called the @entity22 union ruling " kind of great " and said that although he appreciates his basketball scholarship , it does n't cover all of his expenses			2
" i do n't feel student - athletes should get hundreds of thousands of dollars , but like i said , there are hungry nights that i go to bed and i 'm starving , " he said			1
asked whether he felt like an employee -- a key distinction cited in the labor board 's @entity22 ruling -- the @entity55 point guard responded , " i just feel like a student - athlete , and sometimes , like i said , there 's hungry nights and i 'm not able to eat and i still got to play up to my capabilities			1
... when you see your jersey getting sold -- it may not have your last name on it -- but when you see your jersey getting sold and things like that , you feel like you want something in return			0
" the @entity55 played the @entity71 in the @entity6 men 's basketball finals in @entity73 , @entity74 , on monday night			0
@entity18 won 60 - 54 , fueled by a game mvp performance from @entity7 , who had 22 points , six rebounds and three assists			0
@entity8 's student - athlete handbook lays out provisions for dining and says athletes can eat in any residence hall between 7 a.m. and 7:15 p.m. " if you live off campus and your grant - in - aid includes meals , you may use your stipend to purchase an on - campus meal plan			1
... this will entitle you to eat in any of the facilities , " the handbook states ( @entity90 )			0
@entity94 , a spokesman for @entity8 athletics , issued a statement to that effect , telling @entity98 that " @entity7 , like all our scholarship athletes , is provided the maximum meal plan that is allowable under @entity6 rules			2
@entity8 does not have a cafeteria devoted specifically to student - athletes , but they have access to the same cafeterias which are available to all our students			1
" the comments come after a flurry of chatter about @entity22 football players challenging the long - established @entity6 amateur model			1
last month , the @entity27 ruled that @entity22 football players should be considered employees because of the hours they put in , the control the university has over them and the revenue they generate			1
but reaction was mixed , even among those who support @entity6 reform			0
on saturday , for the first time , two leaders on the @entity22 team said after a spring practice that they wo n't vote to unionize , and head coach @entity125 said he told his players he did n't believe a union was in their best interest			1
hours later , @entity6 president @entity129 called the idea " grossly inappropriate			0
" " it would blow up everything about the collegiate model of athletics , " he said			0
the players at @entity22 , led by former quarterback @entity136 and @entity137 , founder of the @entity138 and the @entity139 , say they want better medical coverage , concussion testing , four - year scholarships that cover the entire cost of attendance and the possibility of being paid			1
@entity22 is appealing the ruling to the @entity27 national office and maintains that student - athletes are not university employees but " students , first and foremost			1
" @entity151 has said the @entity22 ruling would have national implications , but he would not talk about whether other schools ' teams were planning to hold union votes			2
at private schools like @entity160 and @entity161 , the process would be similar to the path taken by @entity22 's players			1
there have been indications that officials at those schools are closely monitoring what happens at @entity22			0
however , at public schools , the process would vary from state to state .			0
