@entity0 , @entity1 's much - chided version of @entity2 , celebrated its first birthday last week			1
that probably means one of two things to you			0
if you 're a tech geek : " that site 's still around ? " or if not : " what the heck is @entity0 ? " both of those reactions , however , may be missing the point			1
here 's a look at a few -- and unexpected -- reasons @entity0 is clinging to relevance in the @entity2 era			1
( disclosure : if you 'd like to see where this post began , check out a conversation on my @entity0 page			1
i 'm still a sometimes - active user of the site )			2
' social glue ' for the rest of @entity1 @entity1 last week released a few updates to its social network -- including an events feature and new methods of live photo sharing with small groups			1
perhaps more importantly , it underscored the idea that the company does n't see @entity0 as a social network at all			1
@entity1 's @entity35 told the blog @entity37 that " @entity0 is just an upgrade to @entity1			1
" on one hand , this seems convenient , since @entity0 is losing the numbers game to @entity2			1
( more on that soon )			0
on the other , it might be really smart			0
@entity0 has the potential to be the " social glue " that binds all of @entity1 's already - interesting and already - used products together , writes @entity45 , from the blog @entity47			1
" one year ago , i think we all expected @entity0 to turn into a better standalone product than what we 've got now			1
but despite that , @entity0 has turned out to be incredibly useful to @entity1 , " he says			1
" if i was to project what @entity0 will be like in july 2013 , i 'd guess it will be even less about being a standalone social network and even more about supporting @entity56 , @entity57			1
" you may have noticed this showing up in all kinds of small ways on your version of the @entity62			0
if you have @entity1 social search turned on , you see links friends have posted on @entity0			1
it 's now possible to log into @entity56 using the network			2
@entity69 's " share " feature coordinates with @entity0 these days -- and even e-mail lists can be pulled from @entity1 friend " circles			1
" the rest of @entity1 's products , especially search , are popular , even if @entity0 is n't on its own			1
passionate audience ok , so the numbers			0
@entity2 is clearly winning that war			0
@entity0 has 150 million monthly active users -- compared to @entity2 's 900 million			1
and there 's evidence , some of it from independent traffic monitors , that @entity2 users engage much more frequently and for longer than @entity0 users , at least in public posts ( a @entity88 report in january said @entity2 users spent an average of 7.5 hours on the site , compared to 3.3 minutes on @entity0			2
" ) as the @entity93 put it : " people are ' on ' @entity0 , but they are not really on @entity0			2
the street signs are there			0
people own plots of land			0
but there 's nobody actually visiting town			0
" or , more cuttingly , @entity105 's version : " logging into @entity0 feels like logging into a seminar , or stumbling into the wrong conference room at an airport @entity108			2
it looks like a cubicle farm and smells like a hospital			0
posting anything on @entity0 is like talking into a pillow			2
" @entity115 wrote a eulogy for the network in 2011			0
@entity0 does , however , have some passionate users			2
in a comment on my feed , a person identified as @entity120 wrote that the site may have gotten a slow start but now " it 's so easy to find lots of interesting people to follow / interact with that if you ca n't find someone , you 're probably just missing the point			0
either that , or you want to connect with your long lost friends from high school , which is something that @entity2 probably does better			0
" and from another commenter , @entity137 , wrote : " @entity0 can not be dead with so many of us here ! it is true that i have not gotten many @entity2 friends to join , but as ( another user ) said , @entity0 is international			2
if one is interested in learning and sharing in a much broader space than @entity2 , @entity0 is the place to be ! " ï»¿ mobile apps mobile apps are another area where @entity0 has been making up ground			1
as a blogger at the tech site @entity151 put it : " @entity0 is better than @entity2 -- at mobile			2
" @entity153 goes on to say the @entity155 tablet app for @entity0 makes @entity2 's apps " look as if they were built in the @entity158 era , " adding : " @entity160 is @entity162 ' heel , and it certainly does n't look good for the newly public company to lose to @entity1 in a mobile face - off			1
" that 's especially troubling given that @entity2 execs have said mobile is one of the company 's investment areas moving forward			0
video chats @entity0 's group video chatting feature , called hangouts , has long been one of the ( only ) things that made the site fundamentally different from @entity2 and @entity177			2
the free service lets friends and / or strangers talk in a group			0
you can also record the conversations and take live questions from an audience , which makes the feature popular with news sites , celebs and politicians			0
president @entity191 hosted a hangout earlier this year			0
to drive this point home in adrenelline - filled fashion , @entity1 streamed a video from a skydiver ( who was wearing @entity1 's version of " @entity199 " glasses ) at a recent press conference in @entity201 using a @entity192			1
" as a social network competing with @entity2 it 's a flop , but its video - chat tool @entity173 is a winner , " @entity202 , now at @entity203 , wrote for @entity151 in may			1
new features and product integrations timed with its one - year anniversary , @entity1 announced a few new @entity0 features -- and most of them , as other tech writers have suggested , integrate with @entity1 's other products			1
the @entity216 feature , for example , automatically coordinates with @entity217			1
it also lets attendees at a party or gathering post photos from the event and host hangouts beforehand			0
here 's how the company describes the feature in a blog post : " today 's online event tools are really just web forms that ask , ' are you going ? ' worse yet , they bail when you need them the most : during the actual event , and after everyone leaves			0
in life we plan , we party and we keep in touch			0
software should make all of this more awesome			0
" a " live slideshow " feature lets hosts display photos from the event as they 're taken			0
do you think these updates are enough to save @entity0 ? do you use it ? do you still see it as a @entity2 competitor ? let us know what you think in the comments section -- or , if you want to get super meta , on @entity0 .			2

@entity0 celebrates its first birthday , *launches* new features
@entity216 integrate with photo - sharing and @entity217
the company is positioning the network as an extension of @entity1
*executive* tells @entity262 is not a ' social network '
