-- @entity2 student @entity1 and her friends expected some controversy to arise from a project to raise awareness of what it means to dress up as an ethnic stereotype for @entity10			1
but they were n't expecting the comparisons to robots or dogs			2
the campaign , " we 're a culture , not a costume , " features students of different races holding pictures of costumes of racial or ethnic stereotypes : a geisha , a suicide bomber , a @entity27 , a " @entity28 on a donkey , " a person with their skin painted black and a metal grill in their mouth			1
@entity34 , the campaign drew international media attention , generated intense online debate and perhaps most telling , it became the object of several internet spoofs			1
the memes also come in various forms : a real golden retriever with a picture of a man in a dog costume , a na'vi from the film " @entity53 " holding a picture of a man painted blue , a @entity47 , a dalek with a picture of a dalek , a unicorn with a unicorn , and so on			1
@entity1 , who designed the imagery , never expected it to get this big			2
her first reaction ? " wow			2
a conversation is happening , because that 's all we wanted , to make people think			2
" then came the realization that their original message was getting lost in the mockery , she said			2
" these people that are putting out characters of vampires , dogs , robots , they do n't have anything better to do with their time ? " she said			2
we 're talking about actual race , actual people that are actually affected			1
i guarantee you robots and dogs are not affected by what we 're trying to say			1
" the most startling was an image of a monkey holding a picture of the black student featured in the original poster , she said			1
" that was just awful			0
the fact that people think that 's ok shows why this discussion is still important and relevant , unfortunately , " she said			0
by their nature , these kinds of memes have a way of trivializing the original message , especially when it comes to ad campaigns or psas dealing with social issues , said @entity102 , editor of knowyourmeme.com , a site that tracks viral stuff on the @entity106			1
this campaign in particular has a high " exploitability " quotient because it 's about race and stereotypes , perennial hot topics on the @entity113 , where people can comment anonymously and therefore more freely than they would face - to - face , he said			1
the posters ' design also sets up the objects for exploitation , practically beckoning people to deploy their photoshop skills to play around with various themes , he said			1
@entity102 cited a derivative featuring grunge icon @entity121 holding a picture of the lead singer of @entity125			1
" this would be a perfect example of a movement or campaign with a fixed set of messages that turned into a visual mad lib and turned into something bigger , " he said			1
" i do n't think they 're all necessarily arguing against the campaign or lashing out against it , but it does the subtle job of trivializing the subject 's topic , which is the @entity113 's subtle way of saying , ' no , i beg to differ			1
' " most of the reaction the campaign received directly has been positive , said the group 's president , @entity142			1
other schools in the @entity145 have asked for permission to use the posters , along with a primary school teacher from @entity149			0
" our main purpose was to have a dialogue and discussion and make people think and we 've definitely hit a nerve with people , " she said			1
on the other end of the spectrum , they 've also received hate mail , including an e-mail with the n - word			0
some criticism takes the students to task for being too sensitive and taking themselves too seriously			0
others questioned whether the same concept applied to white people , or costumes of leprechauns or rednecks			0
" i find this article offensive and stereotypical			0
just because i 'm white does n't mean that i take my @entity10 costume as anything more than a costume			2
get a life @entity2 , " one @entity0 commenter said			0
i 'm going to wear a @entity181 suit and stuff it full of pillows , draw some fake beard on my face , add some extra chins , shuffle around dancing badly and go as @entity187			0
but i 'm white , so this is not offensive , " said another			0
the idea to highlight the issue of racial and ethnic costumes resulted from the prevalence of students going in blackface last @entity10 to dress like rappers and @entity196 , @entity142 said			0
an off - campus party last year also encouraged guests to come painted black and dressed " ghetto			0
" " we do n't think we 're being too sensitive			2
i think that 's just the reaction from the majority culture , " @entity142 said , " it 's hard to put yourself in that position of being a minority when you 're not a part of the minority			1
usually the majority culture can exploit and make fun of that			2
" stereotypes have the power to hurt , especially when they embody false or archaic notions about someone , added @entity1 , who is black			0
not all @entity28 travel on donkeys or wear sombreros , just like not all of them are illegal			0
and not all black people are rappers or young single mothers or behave like @entity196			0
" i fight every day to prove i 'm not a stereotype , " she said			0
" i get good grades , i try to be articulate , but it 's frustrating because costumes like that tell me that all of my efforts are fruitless because this is what people think of me at the end of day			0

" we 're a culture , not a costume " ad campaign goes viral , generates race debate
memes feature dog with picture of man in dog costume , @entity121 and image of @entity125
poster layout , themes lend themselves to exploitability , knowyourmeme editor says
" our main purpose was to have a dialogue , " student says
