it may be politically quixotic , but sen. @entity1 proceeded undeterred wednesday in seeking an updated version of the assault weapons ban she sponsored in 1994 that expired a decade later			1
at an emotional committee hearing , @entity1 brought together families who lost loved ones to gun violence , police officials and others to call for banning military - style weapons from civilian use			1
" it is hard for me to be here today to talk about my deceased son but i have to , " sobbed @entity13 , whose son , @entity14 , was one of 20 first - graders shot to death in december in a @entity18 school			0
" i am his voice			0
i am not here for the sympathy or a pat on the back			0
there 's many people that stayed in the town of @entity30			2
i am here to speak up for my son			0
" despite later testimony from witnesses who cited statistics in challenging the effectiveness of tougher gun laws , @entity1 and other supporters said they could n't understand how anyone could argue that the general public has a constitutional right to weapons designed purely to kill as fast and brutally as possible			1
" this is not a class			0
this is not a case study			0
that 's what happens , " said @entity49 mayor @entity48 in arguing that police officers in his city get outgunned by criminals			0
" no one has ever been able to explain why a civilian should have a military - style assault weapon for anything , " he added to applause in the hearing room			0
fierce opposition by the influential @entity62 and conservative legislators , including some @entity64 , makes it virtually impossible for the kind of ban proposed by @entity1 to win congressional approval			1
instead , the legislative focus has shifted to expanding and strengthening background checks for gun purchases , as well as toughening laws against gun trafficking and so - called straw purchases			1
at the conclusion of wednesday 's @entity77 hearing , @entity1 acknowledged the challenge , saying : " it 's an uphill climb			2
" clearly hoping the emotional scenes of @entity13 and other victims of gun violence would generate public pressure on @entity84 to act , she said victory could be possible " with a little bit of help from the people of @entity89			0
" president @entity90 has proposed a package that includes a ban on semi-automatic firearms that mimic military assault rifles , as well as limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds and requiring background checks on all gun sales to close a loophole for private transactions			1
@entity1 is pushing the weapons ban component of legislation the @entity77 will consider in coming weeks			1
she led the battle for the 1994 assault weapons ban , which ended in 2004 when @entity84 failed to renew it			1
photos of the @entity30 victims filled a poster behind @entity1 as she opened wednesday 's hearing by saying a renewed push for an assault weapons ban was necessary " because the massacre in @entity30 was sadly not an anomaly			1
" citing seven mass shootings in 2012 that included notorious incidents in @entity117 , @entity118 , and the @entity18 attack , @entity1 said " we can not allow the carnage i have described to continue			2
" her proposal would ban the manufacture or sale of hundreds of semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault rifles , as well as ammunition magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds			1
anticipating arguments by the @entity62 and other opponents , @entity1 made clear the proposal only applied to future sales , saying anyone who legally owns one of the weapons targeted could keep it			1
in addition , the legislation specifically excludes more than 2,000 kinds of shotguns and other firearms designed and used for hunting and sporting purposes , she noted			0
a video clip she played showed how legal semi-automatic rifles can be easily modified to fire like fully automatic weapons that are banned under current law			2
@entity149 opponents of @entity1 's proposal argued that the 1994 ban proved ineffective , citing studies that determined the law had no direct effect in reducing gun violence			1
in one of several clashes between legislators and witnesses , conservative sen. @entity155 of @entity156 challenged @entity162 police chief @entity161 over a lack of prosecutions of people who failed to pass background gun checks			1
when @entity155 said the low number of prosecutions showed current laws were n't being enforced , @entity161 angrily responded that police officers have to prioritize resources and go after armed criminals instead of " chasing paper , " such as failed background checks			1
" we do n't chase paper			0
we chase people who have guns illegally , " @entity161 said , talking over @entity155 's efforts to stop him			0
another witness , @entity89 attorney @entity178 of @entity118 , later responded to a similar argument from conservative sen. @entity180 of @entity181 by saying that " we go for the worst of the worst			0
" " the worst of the worst is a bad guy actually using a gun , " @entity182 said , adding that the 1.5 million gun sales rejected by a failed background check was " a record of success " regardless of how many prosecutions ensued			2
@entity1 and other supporters also noted that limits on ammunition magazines would require attackers in mass shootings to reload more frequently , providing more time to stop them			2
however , witnesses opposed to limits on weapons contended @entity1 's proposal would be open to legal challenge , and would give criminals who acquire weapons illegally an advantage over law - abiding gun owners			1
former rep. @entity205 , @entity206 , said it was not the time for " feel - good legislation so you can say you did something			0
" " taking guns from law - abiding citizens while leaving them defenseless against violent criminals , who by their very definition do not abide by the law , is not the answer and it is definitely not the right thing to do , " she said in her opening statement			0
the reference to " feel - good legislation " drew a rebuke from sen. @entity222 , @entity223 , who told @entity224 that he was sorry she used the phrase			0
" i do n't feel good about being here today , " @entity222 said			0
" mr. @entity13 does not feel good about being here today			0
" @entity1 noted that the 1994 ban was challenged repeatedly in federal courts on multiple grounds , including @entity231 protections , and survived each time			2
in his opening statement , @entity232 sen. @entity232 of @entity233 conceded that some gun legislation would emerge in the aftermath of the @entity30 killings			2
in particular , he said , new laws would target gun trafficking and straw purchases -- in which a legal buyer purchases firearms for others who are ineligible			1
the @entity77 chairman , sen. @entity245 of @entity246 , was adamant sunday that expanded background checks would not include provisions to register gun owners			1
but he said that responsible @entity89 looking to purchase firearms should n't fear robust checks			0
to @entity251 of @entity252 , an independent policy group , what she called " political reality " means that @entity84 will focus more on keeping weapons out of the wrong hands instead of a new weapons ban			1
that strategy reflects " an understanding of gun crime in the country , " she told @entity262 earlier this month			0
the @entity62 and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms			2
even partial steps in that direction , such as prohibiting specific models , are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of @entity231 rights , they argue			0
in recent decades , the @entity62 has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls -- such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top @entity64 in the 1980s and 90s -- to the incremental measures under consideration now			2
@entity251 , the director of social policy and politics at @entity252 , noted examples of the @entity62 's influence in the last significant gun legislation -- the @entity290 of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers , followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later			1
while the @entity290 led to the background check system in use today , the @entity62 made sure it did n't apply to private sales , such as those at gun shows , she said			2
@entity62 president @entity301 has said he expected few substantive changes in law because the emotional reaction to the @entity30 shooting would eventually give way to common sense regarding gun rights and the wishes of @entity89 gun owners			1
his organization keeps a scorecard for each @entity314 legislator on gun issues , and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates			0
in @entity84 , some influential democrats join virtually all @entity149 in opposing , or at least questioning , a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the @entity323 - style rifle used in the @entity30 shootings			1
senate majority leader @entity325 , who gets high marks from the @entity62 for his opposition to past gun control efforts , has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban			1
according to @entity325 , a bill from the @entity77 was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban , but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate			2
such a vote would amount to @entity1 's last stand on the issue .			0
