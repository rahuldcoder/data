-- the world 's leading golfers have welcomed changes to the @entity4 which will see a greater number of players share one of the sport 's bumper prize funds			1
the @entity4 has announced the season - ending @entity10 will boast an increased jackpot of $ 5 million to be shared between the top 15 players			1
that 's an increase of $ 1.25m on last year 's total , which was shared between just 10 players			1
the @entity10 is the climax of the race to @entity18 , the @entity4 's equivalent of the @entity21 - based @entity20			1
last year @entity22 became the first golfer to win both the race to @entity18 and the @entity20 , helping the @entity26 pocket a cool $ 20m in 2013			1
the world no. 3 welcomed monday 's announcement , which is designed to encourage more players to participate in the @entity30 -- the four tournaments , culminating in the @entity32 , which bring the curtain down on the @entity4 season			2
" it 's good to evaluate and make tweaks to any system , " @entity22 said in a statement			0
" these changes are for the better and wo n't cut anyone out if they do n't want to play all of the @entity30 events			0
" it 's down to yourself , but if you do play in all of them you are giving yourself an even better chance of winning @entity46 to @entity18			2
it 's always nice to see an increase in the @entity49 as well , so i think the announcement is a good move all round			0
" in order to play in last year 's @entity10 , played at @entity55 , golfers had to compete in at least two of the three events prior to the @entity18 finale			1
that requirement has now been scrapped , a move welcomed by former world no. 2 @entity60			0
" i 'm very happy with the changes and i 'm looking forward to @entity63 , " said the @entity61			0
" at the end of the day , we are all working together			0
i 'm very happy to see that we 've reached a middle ground which should help make us all happy			0
" the 2013 @entity30 starts with the @entity69 on october 30 and the @entity71 event on november 9 , both set to take place in @entity73 , @entity74			2
