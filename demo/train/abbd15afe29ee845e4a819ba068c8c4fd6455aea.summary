@entity0 -- a new @entity3 report says many civilian contractors working in @entity5 did n't have proper clearances and could have jeopardized the safety of @entity9 military personnel and undermined national security			1
the defense department inspector general said dozens of contractors worked in sensitive positions without security clearances or the official passes they needed			0
and some of those people , according to the report , were allowed to remain on the job even after inspectors uncovered the security problems			0
the report says a company called @entity24 ( @entity24 ) was awarded the contract in 1999 for what was called @entity27 ( @entity28 - k )			2
the contract was extended and is due to expire at the end of september after costing the government more than $ 3.3 billion dollars			1
" @entity27 contractor employees occupied sensitive positions such as force protection officers , system administrators , and supply inspectors in @entity5 without obtaining security clearances , " the report says			1
the department 's inspector general says the company 's security office failed to track 21 of 379 employees who were in sensitive positions , such as ammunition supply , and that 11 employees did not have a valid security clearance			0
in addition there was no information whether some of the employees had a @entity9 passport , although @entity9 citizenship was required by the contract " additionally , @entity24 officials allowed 20 employees to remain in sensitive positions without the required security clearance after its internal quality assurance office and @entity62 ( the @entity62 , overseeing the contract ) officials informed @entity24 officials that they were in violation of the contract , " the report says			2
" if dcma and contractor officials do not ensure that all employees have the required security clearances and maintain proper security information , they jeopardize the military mission and threaten the safety and security of the military , civilian , and contractor personnel in @entity5			1
" @entity1 was unable to contact representatives of the contractor			0
the inspector general 's report says the company claims it did not understand the terms of the agreement			0
" according to @entity24 's human resources information system analyst , the @entity85 did not clearly define or designate all sensitive positions ; therefore , @entity24 officials relied on their own department managers to determine which positions required a security clearance , " the report says			0
and the report suggests the @entity85 and @entity3 's oversight of the contract may have been lacking			2
" if the @entity85 does not ensure that all contractor employees have the required security clearances and maintain proper security information , these employees pose a threat to the military , civilian , and @entity9 contractor personnel in @entity5 , as well as to national security , " the report says			1
