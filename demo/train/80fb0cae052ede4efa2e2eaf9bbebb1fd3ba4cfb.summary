-- i 've written quite a bit about medical myths , so i 'm always a bit skeptical about medical " knowledge			0
" but one thing i , and i 'm sure many of you , think we understand is obesity			1
after all , weight issues crop up in media constantly			1
just last night , gov. @entity13 was joking about donuts and his weight on the @entity16 with @entity17 , and the @entity19 's weight is once again a subject of discussion in the @entity22 - even though by any objective standard she 's in great shape			1
we know how people gain weight , and we think we know how to lose it			1
except a study in this week 's @entity30 shows us that 's just not right			1
pretty much everything we " know " about obesity and weight loss is wrong			1
let 's start with some things that are true			0
more than a third of @entity37 are obese			0
the @entity39 estimates that obesity - related medical costs were almost $ 150 billion in 2008 , and the cost in health related expensed for an average person who was obese was more than $ 1,400			1
this does n't count the physical , mental or quality - of - life toll that obesity can levy on a person			1
few of us dispute that we need to do something about this problem			2
there are plenty of experts ( present company included ) who will tell you what needs to be done			0
the sad truth , though , is that lots of that advice ( even mine ) turns out to be mistaken			0
i know i 've told people that making small , sustained lifestyle changes is the best way to lose weight over time			2
but it turns out that making such changes , say by deciding to walk a mile every day for five years , results in far less weight loss than you 'd expect			1
@entity71 weighs in on obesity fight i 've lectured people about the importance of physical education in schools , and i 've seen countless reports declaring that the decrease in @entity79 nationwide is one of the reasons that more children are obese or overweight today			2
it turns out that studies do n't show that 's the case			1
my family loves watching " @entity87			2
" but i 've found myself telling my kids again and again that what 's shown on tv is n't the best way to lose weight			2
i tell them that slow and steady works better in the long - run than rapid weight loss			1
i also tell them that setting unrealistic weight goals can actually sabotage your efforts			2
so imagine my shock to discover that what evidence exists in this new study hints towards ambitious goals being a good thing , and that quicker weight loss is n't less likely to be kept off in the long - term			1
people will say eating breakfast is a good idea when you 're trying to lose weight , because it will keep you from binging later			2
but studies show that there 's no protective effect from eating breakfast at all			1
people will say that eating more fruits and vegetables is a great way to lose weight			1
but studies show that , on their own , eating more of them without making other behavioral changes does n't result in any weight loss			1
there 's no magic to fruits and vegetables			2
@entity130 : chefs with issues : farm - to - table should still be on the table people will say that snacking in between meals can lead to weight gain			2
but studies do n't show that to be the case either			1
in general , people compensate for snacking throughout the rest of the day			0
in other words , it 's not necessarily bad to snack outside of usual meal times			0
it 's all enough to cause one to despair			0
but just because so much of what we believe is wrong does n't mean we still ca n't do something about the issue			0
studies do show that you can absolutely overcome genetic and familial factors to lose weight			1
they show that significant physical activity can help with weight loss , and that it has the added bonus of making you healthier in general			1
reducing your caloric intake works overall , especially if it 's done in a way to change your overall eating habits			0
getting the whole family involved is important			0
and finally , for some , bariatric surgery can result in life - changing outcomes			0
over the past five years , my wife and i have lost quite a bit of weight			2
i 'm down somewhere between 15 % to 20 % of my high of more than 200 pounds			0
my wife lost even more , although i 'm not going to give you any numbers ( i like being married )			0
now that i look back , if i 'm going to be honest about it , i did it in bursts over a few months here and there , each time gaining back less than i had lost			0
7 weight loss myths ( sort of ) debunked each time , i had ambitious goals of 15 pounds or more in two to three months , and each time i really restricted my caloric intake			1
but i 've kept the weight off by radically changing my overall eating habits			2
my breakfast consists of just coffee , i eat very light lunches , such as salads , and dinner is usually a healthy home - cooked meal with the family			0
my wife cooks way more than she used to and is obsessed with finding ways to make meals healthier			0
i avoid fried foods almost entirely , and i ca n't remember the last time i ate in a fast food restaurant			0
i also get to the gym two to three times each week			0
i do n't tell you this because i think this is what you should do , or because i think it 's the key to getting thinner			0
i tell you this because more and more , i think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path			1
perhaps our problem is we 're trying to find a one - size - fits - all solution			0
i 'm not sure that exists			0
lastly , what was left out of this new scientific paper was prevention			0
the single best way to fight obesity is to avoid it in the first place			1
that has to start when kids are young , and it 's a lifelong journey			0
but one thing i doubt will ever be proved false is that it 's much easier not to gain the weight in the first place than to take it off later			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

@entity230 : i thought i knew all about obesity ; a new study challenges that
he says obesity a big problem , but weight loss not as *simple* as fruits , veggies and no snacks
studies do show that overall , *vigorous* exercise and watching calories help
@entity230 : best tool against obesity is not to get there in first place
