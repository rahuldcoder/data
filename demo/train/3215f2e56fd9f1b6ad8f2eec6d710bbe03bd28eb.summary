-- @entity1 , meet @entity2			0
it 's not a collaboration @entity5 imagined in his wildest imagination			1
and , as any reader of @entity9 ' comic strip " @entity10 " knows , @entity5 has a pretty wild imagination			1
but there was the proof , in black and white ( and , in many newspapers and online , full color ) : " @entity1 sharing panels with the work of " @entity19 " legend @entity20 , creator of the mischievous boy , his stuffed tiger and countless space - and time - defying alter egos			1
" @entity19 " creator returns for a comics cameo for @entity5 , a huge " @entity19 " fan , the partnership was never less than intimidating			1
" just working with him , i was so scared at all points , " he told @entity0 in a phone interview			0
" what if he thought , ' he 's not as funny as i thought he was ? ' at every point , i thought he would go away , and what proof i would have that this ever happened ? " for @entity5 , who usually works several months in advance , the strips came together remarkably quickly			1
he and @entity20 first got in touch april 11 , the day @entity5 had a strip that falsely portrayed him as the author of " @entity19 " in order to get a woman in bed			1
some time earlier , he had been told by a mutual friend , @entity44 cartoonist @entity43 , that @entity20 had been wanting to get in touch			1
@entity20 is a longtime " pearls " fan , the " @entity19 " cartoonist told the @entity44			1
" several years ago , when @entity5 did one of his strips that mocked his own drawing ability and mentioned my strip in comparison , i thought it might be funny for me to ghost ' pearls ' sometime , just to flip it all on its head , " @entity20 said			1
@entity20 and @entity5 finally exchanged e-mails and @entity20 suggested doing something together			1
" i got that e-mail on a friday			0
i think i literally stood up at the couch , " @entity5 recalls			1
it may seem like an unlikely pairing			0
@entity9 regularly features himself as a character in his strip and enjoys touring the country , promoting it and his " @entity71 " series of children 's books			0
@entity20 is known as reclusive and private ; there 's just one known picture of him in existence			2
@entity5 would be the first to tell you that he 's not the world 's greatest artist , and his characters -- @entity80 -- are drawn with blunt simplicity			2
@entity20 is one of the finest draftsmen to ever pick up a pencil			2
and @entity20 , @entity5 learned , is n't the most tech - savvy artist			1
the " pearls " cartoonist thought they could exchange work online , but @entity20 wanted to use actual hand - delivered mail			1
" i talked him out of that because i was so scared , " says @entity5 , noting that any @entity20 drawings would be worth thousands			1
but electronic collaboration had its own challenges			2
" he could not set the scanner to get rid of the pencil lines			0
he had trouble even putting ( his work ) on the scanner straight			0
he had trouble with e-mail attachments , " he says			0
but @entity5 reveled in the trade - offs			1
" that part of it was funny			0
with anyone else it would be frustrating			0
with @entity109 , i cherished every e-mail			0
" then came the matter of maintaining the secret			0
it was n't easy , especially since @entity5 was a finalist for the @entity114 -- cartooning 's highest honor -- this year			2
the group met in may for its annual honors , and it was all @entity5 could do not to scream the news from the heavens			2
" i 'm in a room with 200 cartoonists			0
you know how hard it is not to say , ' hey , @entity20 is drawing my strip ' ? " he says			2
when @entity20 's contributions started appearing on wednesday , eagle - eyed readers may have recognized the style and lettering -- particularly in thursday 's strip , which was full of @entity130 and robots , " @entity133 " favorites			1
but @entity5 suspects many fans were thrown off by friday 's strip , which included two voluptuous women who looked like " @entity137 and @entity138			2
the reaction to the news has been tremendous , says @entity5			2
his blog and the " pearls " comics page each did 10 times their normal traffic			0
it was enough to blow out a server at @entity148 , his syndicator			0
now that the @entity1 is out of the bag , the strips will be auctioned off			0
indeed , a primary reason for @entity20 's involvement was his activity with @entity155 , a charity co-founded by cartoonist @entity156 , who suffers from @entity157 's			1
and @entity20 may not be as reclusive as his image suggests			2
besides his work with " pearls " and @entity155 , he 's also given an interview to @entity163 magazine			1
he may not be returning to daily fare , but it 's not like he 's turned into a hermit			0
in fact , after their long - distance collaboration -- which was done entirely through e-mail , without so much as even one phone call -- @entity5 finally got to meet his hero last week in @entity173 when they went to visit @entity156			1
the pair spent hours talking about @entity176 -- a mutual influence -- the challenges of the comic strip business , and simply the wonders of humor			0
@entity20 is " quick to laugh , " says @entity5			1
" when you make him laugh , he really laughs			0
" and @entity5 could n't be happier			2
" i 'm still on cloud 9 , " he says			0
" i will never top this			0

" pearls " cartoonist @entity5 says the collaboration came quickly
the two *communicated* long - distance to do strips
artwork will be used as fund - raiser for @entity155 charity
