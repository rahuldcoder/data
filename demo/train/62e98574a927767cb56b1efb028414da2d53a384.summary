@entity1 ' pick for the most fascinating person of 2014 is interestingly a celebrity who shuns such a spotlight			2
on sunday night @entity1 named @entity5 as the top selection for her annual list			1
the former @entity8 married @entity5 , one of the world 's most eligible bachelors , in september			1
already an accomplished international human rights attorney , the new mrs. @entity5 was not well known by the general public prior to being linked to the award - winning actor			1
" i guess the question is : ' what does it take to fascinate one of the most fascinating men in the world ? ' " @entity1 said introducing mrs. @entity5 as the selection			1
" she is known primarily through her spouse			2
and while we now little about her , we know a great deal about him			0
" @entity5 had famously told @entity1 in a 1995 interview " i 'm never going to get married again			1
" the word spread so successfully , @entity5 told @entity1 in 2006 that he no longer had to tell women he dated that he planned on staying single			2
" you did my work for me , " he told her			0
snagging the perennial bachelor is what grasped the " most fascinating " title for his wife			0
" amazingly , @entity35 has been the subject of very little snark or envy , " @entity1 said			0
" maybe because we , like @entity40 , find it impossible to resist perfection			0
or maybe it is because it is heartening to think that no matter how long it may take the perfect someone is out there for everyone			0
" @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 also made this year 's list .			1
