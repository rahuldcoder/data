-- with spectacular mountains , vibrant hill tribes and a relaxed vibe , @entity5 's unofficial " second city " of @entity6 is everything @entity8 is n't			1
as the travel hub for northern @entity5 , the city of @entity6 and the province that shares its name ( population 1.6 million ) blend ancient culture and natural wonders to create a character that 's unique to a region once known as the @entity17 , or " @entity18 " in @entity19			1
in a kind of repeat of history , parts of the city have been invaded by regional neighbors in recent years			2
in the past , invaders came from @entity27 , @entity5 or other regional rivals			2
this time , it 's tour groups from @entity30 , lured by the success of a massive - hit @entity30 comedy movie called " lost in @entity5 , " which is partially based in @entity6			1
fortunately , you can still lose yourself in @entity6 's majestic mountains , find a quiet picnic spot next to a cascading stream or visit with its friendly people			1
eating khao soi nothing says " i 'm in @entity6 " more than slurping a piquant bowl of khao soi , noodles bathed in an intense curry broth topped with crispy noodles			1
the dish is traditionally served with chicken or beef with a side of chili paste , pickled cabbage , raw shallots and wedge of lime			1
arguably northern @entity5 's most famous dish , khao soi can be found from unnamed holes - in - the - wall to five - star resorts , all peddling renditions of the " best " noodles money can buy			1
for a fail - safe lunchtime introduction , @entity63 or @entity64 , both on @entity6 's @entity66 , are terrific choices			1
a glass of the herbal drink bai bua bok ( @entity73 pennywort ) helps you cool off after the spicy meal			2
camping under the stars with seven national parks in the province , many door - to - doi ( mountain ) excursions are within easy striking distance of the @entity6 city center			1
you can pitch your own tent at designated campsites or rent one on arrival from the park headquarters			2
most parks also have cabins or huts for rent , though these must be reserved , easiest via the @entity95 website			2
@entity96 , with its dramatic river - canyon landscape littered with boulders , and @entity99 , named after the highest peak in the country , offer waterfall and cave attractions by day and stargazing by night			1
both are within a two - hour drive from town			2
visiting @entity108 presiding over the mountainous horizon to the northwest of the city , @entity108 mountain is the most recognizable landmark in @entity6			1
its glimmering mountaintop temple is a popular first stop for visitors			2
most make the trek up the 300 - plus steps of the @entity122 staircase to visit the working monastery in the daytime , from which , weather permitting , you can get panoramic views of the city			2
a better time to go is in the early hours of the morning , when you can avoid the heat and crowds , and watch the flickering lights of the city fade as the sun rises			2
the climb to the top is a thigh - buster , but it 's worth it for the great views			1
there 's also a scenic road up @entity108 for those who prefer to drive			1
trekking to hill tribe villages nearby hills or dois mean there are plenty of nature - based day trips in the area , often with a waterfall to cool off in			0
tour operators will often combine a handful of excursions in a single day			0
the best and priciest outfits in town provide private customized tours that allow you to choose your activities and not be herded along with the crowd			0
a great leisurely activity , bamboo rafting in @entity164 provides a closeup introduction to the region 's lush forests			1
to admire the greenery from top down , flight of the @entity169 in @entity170 offers 5 kilometers of zip line through a forest canopy			0
the village of @entity175 is big on community - based tourism			0
it 's a place to stop for a freshly brewed cup of coffee while overlooking terraced rice paddies before following a local guide on a 3 - kilometer trek to a " hidden " waterfall			1
getting a foot massage at the market in recent years , a slew of modern malls has sprung up in the city			0
but @entity6 's vibrant street markets are still the place to get the classic retail experience			1
the best choices are the nightly bazaar on @entity195 ; saturday walking street on @entity196 ; and @entity197 down @entity198 inside the old city walls			0
sunday walking @entity200 is the most popular of the bunch , with back - to - back vendors selling trinkets , boutique fashion and handicrafts			0
with shopping comes sore feet			0
fortunately , entrepreneurial massage ladies have that covered -- in the market , rows of plastic chairs set up on the pavement lure shoppers with $ 5 - an - hour foot rubs			0
you can get your feet rubbed while sipping on a drink from the market and watching crowds amble past			0
celebrating local festivals festivals in @entity6 are celebrated with boisterous party fervor and observance of ancient traditions			1
one of the best holidays is @entity226 , the @entity226 , observed over three official days but often lasting five days each april ( dates change every year )			0
cultural activities are centered around @entity229 , the city 's most visited temple , and the old town			2
to take part in @entity6 's famed full - fledged water fight , you need to pick a strategic station and get ready to get wet -- @entity237 , anywhere along the moat , next to the @entity240 , around @entity242 and @entity243 shopping centers , are areas of intense activity and big crowds			1
another festival worth planning a trip to @entity6 around is @entity249 , which coincides with the @entity18 festival of @entity249			1
on that november night ( again , the dates change annually ) , tens of thousands of paper lanterns ( khom loy ) are set off into the sky and thousands more candle - lit floats are released along waterways			0
the best photo op is at the mass release behind @entity259			0
bundling up for " winter " when the year - end holidays roll around and the mercury dips below 20 @entity262 ) , the cardigans and beanies come out as city folk head for @entity6 to enjoy the " winter			1
" visitors tend to follow suit , putting away the tank tops and cutoffs and bundling up for the weather as they head for higher ground up in the dois			0
it really does get chilly			0
hot springs suddenly make sense , especially if you stay the night to experience the misty mornings and maximum nighttime chills in the hills			0
best day - trip spots for a steamy soak are the @entity281 at @entity282 and , closer to @entity6 , @entity283 at @entity284			1
both have hiking trails and impressive viewpoints			0
taking a road trip the roads around @entity6 are some of the most scenic in the country			1
one of the best known is the @entity291 , a 600 - kilometer journey that starts from @entity6 , and , traveling counterclockwise , passes through @entity293 , @entity291 and @entity294 before returning to the starting point			1
driving yourself is the best way to do this multiday excursion -- car and motorbike rental shops are found all over the city -- allowing you to stop to admire the mountainous landscape , visit small villages and swim beneath waterfalls			0
the shorter , 100 - kilometer @entity305 makes for an easy day trip			0
it passes through @entity308 and @entity309 just outside of town			0
both of these loops have food stops along the way , but it never hurts to have bags of sai - ua ( northern @entity19 herb sausages ) and sticky rice for a spontaneous hillside picnic en route			0
relaxing the pace of life in @entity6 is refreshingly slower than in @entity8 , giving it a sleepy ambiance that adds to its charm			1
to indulge in the chilled - out lifestyle , you 'll want to kick back in a waterside setting with views of the mountainous surroundings and , of course , good food			0
about an hour 's drive from town , and a longtail boat ride away , you can dine in one of the floating restaurants in @entity338 in @entity339 -- there 's nothing to do here but eat , drink , swim and be merry			2
houseboats can be rented by the day , and if you ca n't tear yourself away from the scenic surroundings , it 's worth staying overnight			1
closer to town , @entity349 lake has a similar food - nature - and - not - much - else appeal			0
located close to the base of @entity108 , the lake is dotted with private open air huts on the water 's edge where you can order food from nearby restaurants , swim and just whittle away the day enjoying the moment			2
very relaxed , very @entity6			1
gallery : @entity6 's laid - back street style 10			1
seeing the city from the sky for the best view of the city , you can reach for the skies in a basket			0
weather permitting , @entity368 ( +66 84 611 4128 ) offers twice - daily hot air balloon flights year - round			0
rides last about 90 minutes			0
morning flights tend to be smoother , and you can enjoy views of rice paddies , sprawling valley floors and 360 - degree doi - scapes			0
it 's quiet up here , so you can be alone with your thoughts , which will most likely turn to the champagne breakfast awaiting at the end of the ride .			2
