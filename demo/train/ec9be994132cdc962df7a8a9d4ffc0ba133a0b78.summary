-- it 's a warm day in @entity2 , @entity3 , a small town in @entity5 's heartland			2
off a main thoroughfare , an unassuming gym sits in a strip mall			0
people come and go , passing a young woman sitting in a desk chair just inside the gym 's front door , getting her hair and makeup done			2
she is @entity17 , and when the women 's gymnastics all - around gold medal was placed around her neck at the @entity22 , she became an instant superstar			1
when we met her at the gym her host family owns , she was busy smiling , jumping and posing for a photo shoot with @entity28			0
here , in the middle of @entity3 , @entity29 continues to work and train , and balance new - found celebrity with everyday life			0
one year after the @entity22 , it is just one example of how everything and nothing has changed			1
the @entity38 event was heralded as " the @entity40 " and for good reason -- for the first time , every country and every event allowed women to compete			1
exactly a century after the founder of the modern @entity47 said " an @entity48 with females would be impractical , uninteresting , unaesthetic and improper , " the @entity45 , or @entity45 , celebrated the most equal olympics to date			1
some countries , like the @entity5 and @entity52 , actually sent more women than men			2
and for the first time ever , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 had women on their national teams			2
@entity57 was long seen as the last holdout , its hand eventually being forced by the @entity45 , which delivered an ultimatum : send women , or face a ban from all @entity22 competition			2
in a country where women ca n't vote until 2015 , ca n't play sports in public schools , and ca n't even drive , the @entity67 country had to find female athletes to represent it			2
the search turned up two women -- @entity77 and @entity78			2
@entity77 , a dual citizen of @entity57 and the @entity5 , grew up in @entity79			0
normally a marathon runner , she was told less than two months before the @entity40 began that she would be running the 800 - meter race in @entity38			0
" it was definitely a big thought process going into it , " @entity77 told @entity0 's " @entity83 " documentary in her first television interview since the @entity47			1
" it was n't something that i 'd been working for , for so long , which so many olympians do , and essentially it came down to , how could i not go ? " the sight of @entity77 on the running track dressed in leggings , long sleeves and a special head - covering brought international attention to an otherwise routine 800m heat			0
and while she finished dead last , she was celebrated around the world for her historic accomplishment			0
but not everyone was pleased with @entity57 's compliance			0
back in the kingdom , @entity77 and 16 - year - old teammate @entity78 faced criticism and threats			0
on @entity104 , someone started the hashtag " prostitutes of the @entity47 " in @entity105 , and many wondered if @entity77 and @entity78 -- who lost her first judo match in less than two minutes -- were truly trailblazers , or token entrants			1
" it really was a brilliant moment , " says @entity112 , sports editor of @entity113 , and the @entity115 's first female sports editor of a major @entity115 newspaper			0
" but when those girls went back to @entity57 and all these other countries , whether that led to girls in their countries suddenly putting on trainers and throwing off their burkas and getting out on the running track , i 'm not sure			0
" one games , over two weeks , however wonderful it was , is n't enough to change the face of women 's sport			1
" while the @entity45 also admits more needs to be done , particularly in getting more women into leadership positions in sport , there is no doubt @entity22 was worth celebrating for most -- but not all			1
@entity135 athlete @entity134 disputes the claim that all the events included women			0
she is a canoeist , competing at world championships but not at the @entity47 -- because her sport is not included			1
the event of " canoe and kayak " is grouped -- allowing the @entity45 to say all events include women , when technically they do n't			1
" it 's very frustrating , " said @entity134			0
" there 's 36 , 37 countries competing or developing women 's canoe around the world , so i know there are athletes who are at standard , who want to race , and are very much capable of racing at the @entity47			1
" it shines a light on another inequality at the @entity47 -- the medal count			1
at @entity22 , men had the chance to compete in 163 events , while the women had only 131 events			0
some events , like boxing , had fewer weight classes available to women , even though women 's international boxing recognizes more than the three chosen for the @entity22 program			1
@entity134 filed a discrimination claim against the @entity172 last year			0
and while she was n't able to get women 's canoe added to the @entity22 program , she continues the fight for the next @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178 , in 2016			1
but the women who did get their chance last year took full advantage			2
many of the most memorable faces of the @entity184 were females -- like the @entity115 's @entity185 , @entity29 and her " @entity187 " teammates , the @entity5 women 's football side and @entity52 swimmer @entity189			1
despite the challenges that remain , @entity22 provided a foundation for gender equality in sport			0
it produced countless female role models , heroes , and champions -- and for 17 days in time , leveled the playing field			1
" it 's the start is n't it , " said @entity198			0
" hopefully we 'll look back in 20 , 30 years and remember that first @entity47 when it started and then go , ' gosh you would n't imagine an @entity47 not full of women			1
' " so it 's just a start of a very big process , and it was a fantastic start			0

a year on from the @entity47 have attitudes towards women 's sport changed ?
women competed in every event at 2012 and were on every single team
led to hopes the fight against inequality in sport could be *transformed*
games produced countless role models , heroes , and champions
